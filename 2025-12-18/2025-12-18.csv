            Russian personnel with links to the country's military and security services have engaged in spying in European waters while working covertly on ships carrying Russian oil, Western and Ukrainian intelligence sources exclusively told CNN.
    


            Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has built up a so-called shadow fleet of hundreds of tankers. These vessels carry Russia's oil from its Baltic and Black Sea ports despite Western sanctions, earning the Kremlin hundreds of millions of dollars every year.
    


            In recent months, some of these ships – often registered to unrelated countries – have acquired extra crew members shortly before leaving port, according to Ukrainian intelligence. CNN has seen two crew lists for these vessels in which the staff is predominantly non-Russian – but the documents also feature a pair of Russian names, and their Russian passport details, at the bottom of the roster.
    


            The addition of Russians with security backgrounds to the crews of the shadow fleet is causing alarm in European capitals as it illustrates how brazen the Kremlin's tactics have become.
    


            Speaking to multiple intelligence sources, CNN has established that several of these men are employed by a secretive Russian company called Moran Security. Some of them are mercenaries, they said, who have previously worked for Russia's private military contractors, such as the notorious Wagner group.
    


            Moran is a private security firm with ties to Russian military and intelligence, Western intelligence sources said. The firm was sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2024 for providing “armed security services” for Russian state-owned enterprises to “intensify the pressure on Russia for its continued cruel and unprovoked war against Ukraine.”
    


            Moran personnel have been placed on multiple tankers in Russia's shadow fleet and are frequently the only Russians on board, according to both Ukrainian and Western intelligence sources.
    


            Ukrainian intelligence said it observed the introduction of these guards on board the shadow fleet about six months ago.
    


            One Western intelligence source added that, on one occasion, Moran personnel took photographs of European military installations from one of the shadow fleet vessels. The source would not provide further details.
    


            The Russians on board are also tasked with keeping an eye on the ships' captains because most of them are not Russian citizens, according to Oleksandr Stakhnevych of the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine.
    


            One Western intelligence source echoed that assessment, saying that “in Moran's case, they are not engaged in direct conflict. They ensure that their contractors act in line with the Kremlin's interests.”
    


            The presence and activities of the Russians on board these ships are of growing concern to Europe's security services given the number of vessels in the shadow fleet sailing close to the continent's coastlines and the potential for espionage.
    


            Security officials say that putting armed men with military backgrounds on these vessels is yet another tool in the Kremlin's arsenal of hybrid warfare techniques designed to cause disruption in Europe. Intelligence sources also told CNN that these men have engaged in sabotage but did not provide further details.
    


            “Having private armed groups onboard shadow fleet vessels is this classic plausible deniability,” Jacob Kaarsbo, a former Danish intelligence official, told CNN.
    


            “Everyone with even half a clue knows that these guys take their orders from the Russian state but it's hard to prove,” he added.
    


            CNN presented the findings of  Ukrainian and Western intelligence that Moran operates in coordination with Russian intelligence and is involved in espionage and sabotage across Europe to Alexey Badikov, who the US Treasury had listed as the company's CEO. Reached by phone Badikov told CNN he is the deputy director of the Moran Security Group and is based “mostly” in St. Petersburg, but declined to comment on either accusation.
    


            CNN pieced together Moran's recent activities on one vessel by reviewing Ukrainian intelligence and obtaining assessments from Western intelligence, as well as analyzing satellite imagery and maritime data.
    


            That ship is a sanctioned tanker called the Boracay, which has changed its name and where it is officially registered frequently over the past three years.
    


            On September 20, two Russian men boarded the Boracay at the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk near St. Petersburg, according to records obtained by CNN. Satellite imagery and ship tracking data showed the vessel at the port on this date.
    


            The men were not traditional mariners but described on the crew roster simply as technicians. They were the only Russians aboard the ship, which was otherwise crewed by citizens of China, Myanmar and Bangladesh, according to the list.
    


            Ukrainian foreign intelligence identified the two men and CNN confirmed their names with Western intelligence sources.
    


            One of them is a former police officer who previously worked for the Russian private military company Wagner, according to a Western intelligence source. Neither of the men have much of an online profile, and their activities on board the Boracay are unclear.
    


            When asked if he could confirm if the two men worked for Moran security, Badikov told CNN, “I am not in a position to confirm.” When prodded further, he said he has “no idea.”
    


            During another voyage made by the Boracay in July, one man on board had served in the special police regiment of Russia's interior ministry, and another held the Russian defense ministry as his registered address, according to Ukrainian foreign intelligence.
    


            Many shadow fleet vessels travel through the Baltic Sea, a key maritime chokepoint bordering several NATO states, including Denmark and Sweden, whose authorities pay close attention to the ships.
    


            Danish sea pilots, who board the tankers to help them navigate the straits, say there are frequently Russian men on board who seem very much in charge and are hostile toward inspectors.
    


            “I have personally seen at least two shadow fleet boats where crew is mostly non-Russians, but suddenly you'll see one or two Russians as part of the list,” said Bjarne Caesar Skinnerup, one of the most experienced officers at Denmark's state pilot service DanPilot.
    


            Sometimes, he said, they are wearing uniforms, which on one occasion appeared to be a Russian Navy camouflage uniform.
    


            “On board, it seems they run the ship – have more power than even the captain,” Skinnerup told CNN.
    


Shipping routes and flight data: CNN investigates drone sightings in Europe



            In July, DanPilot sent an email to Denmark's Emergency Management authority, saying: “There are more and more reports of ships that have a few extra crew members, probably Russian, who are wearing military uniforms and are very active in photographing, among other things, bridge areas.”
    


            The email was shared with CNN by the investigative outlet Danwatch, which has reported extensively on Russia's shadow fleet.
    


            Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Sweden's coast guard told CNN it had previously seen men on board shadow fleet ships who did not seem to belong to a merchant vessel.
    


            A senior Swedish navy commander, Ewa Skoog Haslum, said last year that some Russian-linked tankers in the Baltic had been carrying “antennas and masts that typically do not belong” to merchant ships.
    


            The Boracay made headlines in September as it carried a cargo of Russian oil to India.
    


            Two days after leaving Primorsk, on September 22, the ship was off Denmark's coast just as a series of drone sightings disrupted traffic at Copenhagen airport. Other drones flew near Danish military bases.
    


            At the time, Copenhagen police said they were investigating whether ships in the area had launched the drones but would not name which ones.
    


            Ship tracking data shows the Boracay traveled south along Denmark's western coast on the evening of September 24, when other drones were reported flying north of the city of Esbjerg and near several nearby airports.
    


            A Western intelligence source told CNN, “the coincidence between the incident and the presence of the vessel in the area can be regarded as suspicious.”
    


            Days after these incidents, the French military boarded the Boracay off the coast of Brittany in northwest France, after it failed to provide proof of the boat's nationality. No drones were found onboard.
    


            It was only then that the two Russians were discovered to be among the crew, according to Western security sources. They were questioned in private, according to the sources.
    


            The Chinese captain was arrested and subsequently charged by French authorities with “disobeying instructions.” The Boracay had been claiming to be sailing under the flag of Benin since September, but prosecutors in France said they were investigating the “lack of documentation of the ship's nationality and flag affiliation.”
    


            At the time, French and Danish authorities declined to comment on whether the French investigation into the Boracay was related to the drone incidents over Denmark.
    


            Kaarsbo, the former intelligence official, said that while it's not possible to prove whether the men are trained drone pilots, “these guys are not just innocent sailors… there's a decent likelihood that they are capable of launching drones.”
    


            Badikov, however, dismissed the premise, telling CNN “it's completely crazy” that “the crude oil tanker would launch the drones over Denmark”.
    


            “If you would like to use drones, you will use from fishing vessels… not from the big oil tanker,” he added, because “it is technically unsafe and nobody will do it”.
    


            One European intelligence official told CNN: “Our working assumption is that Russian ships have been involved in at least some of the unexplained drone events close to European coastlines.”
    


            The UK's new foreign intelligence chief, Blaise Metreweli, said this week that “Russia is testing us in the gray zone with tactics that are just below the threshold of war,” such as “drones buzzing airports and bases, aggressive activity in our seas above and below the waves.”
    


            Ukrainian intelligence sources shared with CNN the names of eight Russian men who had been on board other ships in the shadow fleet and had sailed a similar route around Europe in the past year. Several had links to the Russian military.
    


            CNN was unable to reach the management of the Boracay.
    


            After passing Europe the vessel continued to Vadinar port in western India, where it unloaded a cargo of Russian oil on November 1, according to Kpler, a global data and analytics firm.
    


            Moran Security Group was founded in 2009 and had extensive ties with the infamous Wagner private military contractor, as well as Russia's military and intelligence services, according to Western intelligence sources.
    


            Two previous Moran directors, Evgeny Sidorov and Vadim Gusev, founded the Slavonic Corps in 2013, the private military company from which Wagner emerged. Wagner Telegram channels have featured Moran personnel at sea, and more than a decade ago the company was involved in counter-piracy off Somalia.
    


            The social media profiles of some Moran personnel also show they were linked to Wagner, which was effectively liquidated after its then boss Yevgeny Prigozhin launched an abortive revolt in Russia in 2023.
    


            On its website, the Moran group says it seeks “active-duty or retired officers who have served in special forces units (GRU, airborne troops, naval commandos) and who have completed at least two deployments.” The GRU is Russia's military intelligence service.
    


            Moran's president Vyacheslav Kalashnikov is a retired lieutenant colonel of Russia's FSB intelligence service, while two of the managers listed on its website are former commanders of nuclear submarines.
    


            The group advertises a wide range of services: international logistics, maritime and onshore physical security, as well as intelligence operations. Moran personnel had a role in Syria in support of the now ousted Assad regime, as did Wagner, according to Ukrainian intelligence.
    


            Last year's US Treasury designation said the company “offers armed security services and has operated under contract to Russian state-owned enterprises.” One of these organizations is Sovcomflot, Russia's state-owned shipping company, which is listed on Moran's website as a client.
    


            Ukrainian intelligence said it had observed the introduction of the teams on board the shadow fleet about six months ago.
    


            Moran has had a checkered history. The company appears to have been closed in Russia in 2017 and then opened an office in the former Soviet republic of Georgia the following year, according to the country's corporate register. That appears to have been a short-lived presence.
    


            Now, however, Moran Security is registered in both Moscow and Belize and the group appears to have a new and growing mission. Belize is widely recognized as a jurisdiction for setting up shell companies that mask the real beneficiaries of a business.
    


            As Russia's shadow fleet appears to be expanding in scope and ambition, Europe is facing a delicate dilemma.
    


            Danish sea pilot Skinnerup believes there should be tougher joint international action to intercept ships without insurance and proper registration, as is the case with many of the shadow fleet.
    


            “Do we dare to do that? Because what would be the reaction from Russia?” he asked.
    


            “That's why Danish government has not done anything yet, because we are an extremely small country, and if we have to do something, it has to be a joint European thing.”

            Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro said Wednesday that his US counterpart Donald Trump had revealed his true motives toward the South American country with his claim that that it had stolen US “oil, land and other assets.”
    


            Maduro said Trump's claim showed the US was really seeking regime change along with ownership of Venezuela's territory and resources. Previously, the US has characterized its build-up of naval forces near the country as being aimed at combating drug-trafficking.
    


            “It is simply a warmongering and colonialist pretense, and we have said so many times, and now everyone sees the truth. The truth has been revealed,” Maduro said during a speech in Caracas Wednesday.
    


            “The aim in Venezuela is a regime change to impose a puppet government that wouldn't last 47 hours, that would hand over the Constitution, sovereignty, and all the wealth, turning Venezuela into a colony. It will simply never happen,” he continued.
    


Trump's blockade could lead to regime change in Venezuela - analyst says



            On Tuesday, Trump wrote on Truth Social that the military buildup around Venezuela would get bigger until the country returned to the US “the oil, land, and other assets that they previously stole from us.”
    


            Trump told reporters on Wednesday that Venezuela had illegally taken away “energy rights” and that the US wanted them back. “We're getting land, oil rights, whatever we had. They took it away because we had a president that maybe wasn't watching. But they're not going to do that. We want it back. They took our oil rights. We had a lot of oil there. As you know, they threw our companies out and we want it back.”
    


            Venezuela brought its oil sector under state control in the 1970s. Prior to that, American companies had had a much larger presence in the country's oil fields.
    


            Trump has repeatedly warned that the US could carry out strikes in Venezuela soon, and said that any country trafficking drugs into the United States is “subject to attack,” suggesting that neighboring Colombia could be one of them.
    


            In his speech on Wednesday, Maduro called on Colombia to unite with Venezuela and defend both nations' sovereignty.
    


            “I make my call … to the ordinary people of Colombia, to its social movements, to its political forces, to the Colombian military, whom I know very well. I call upon them for a perfect union with Venezuela so that no one dares touch the sovereignty of our countries,” Maduro said.
    


            Maduro also condemned Trump's comments in a phone call with UN Secretary-General António Guterres on Wednesday, Venezuela's government said.
    


            “President Maduro stressed that such statements must be categorically rejected by the United Nations system, as they constitute a direct threat to sovereignty, international law, and peace,” the Venezuelan government said in a statement.
    


            Maduro claimed that recent US actions against Venezuela were part of a “diplomacy of barbarism” which he said went against the principle of international coexistence.
    


            Guterres' office later confirmed the phone conversation had taken place, saying the secretary-general had “reaffirmed the United Nations' position on the need for member states to respect international law, particularly the United Nations Charter, exert restraint and de-escalate tensions to preserve regional stability.”
    


            Earlier, UN spokesperson Farhan Haq told reporters that Guterres was focused on avoiding any further escalation between the US and Venezuela.
    


            “Of course, as always, he believes that any difference must be resolved by peaceful means,” Haq said.
    


            The exchanges came just a day after Trump said he would impose a blockade on all sanctioned oil tankers transiting Venezuela.
    


            Asked if a blockade would violate international law, Haq replied: “I think we are looking at what the applicable laws are at this stage and we're studying the situation but certainly parties have to abide by the UN Charter and you can read the charter for yourself and see what that entails.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","EU leaders meet to stall or steal Russian assets for Ukraine: Live Updates","https://www.rt.com/news/629589-eu-struggling-plan-steal-russian-assets/","Thu, 18 Dec 2025 09:06:00 GMT","

EU leaders are meeting in Brussels on Thursday amid sharp divisions over a proposal to use frozen Russian state assets to finance Ukraine's military – a plan Moscow has denounced as outright theft and warned would trigger legal retaliation.

EU members have long debated tapping Russian central bank funds estimated at around €210 billion ($246 billion) as part of a so-called “reparations loan” to Kiev (to understand why that is a misnomer and part of EU spin, read here) which it will have to repay only if Russia agrees to pay war damages.

The money will help cover Ukraine's imploding budget, which faces an estimated $160 billion shortfall over the next two years.

The idea, pushed by EU chief Ursula von der Leyen, has faced mounting resistance from several member states, which argue the move risks undermining the bloc's legal foundations, damaging confidence in the Eurozone, and exposing European institutions to costly lawsuits.

Belgium, where most of the assets are held via the Euroclear settlement system, has been a particularly vehement critic of the plan, demanding that legal risks be shared among other EU members.

Disagreements have been so intense that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Wednesday that the Russian assets issue “will not be on the table” at all during the leaders' meeting. The official agenda also does not explicitly mention Russian assets, saying only that EU leaders “will discuss the latest developments in Ukraine and issues that require urgent EU action.”

EU sanctions normally require unanimous approval, giving any single member state a veto. To avoid that, the bloc last week invoked controversial emergency legislation – already the subject of a legal challenge by the European parliament – to lock the assets in place temporarily, arguing that any subsequent steps can be approved separately by a qualified majority of 55% member states representing at least 65% of the EU's population.

Moscow has warned that any attempts to seize its assets will constitute “theft” and violate international law, adding that the move would trigger retaliatory measures and legal action.

Tusk offered no clarity on whether EU leaders had agreed on a way forward, saying only that Europe faced a “simple choice” between financial support now or “blood” down the line - a decision he said European leaders must confront themselves.

PM Tusk:Now we have a simple choice. Either money today or blood tomorrow. And I am not talking about Ukraine only, I am talking about Europe.And this is our decision to make. And only ours. I think all European leaders have to finally rise to this occasion.So this is all… https://t.co/evGrQbrQ4Ipic.twitter.com/mfqkVIKWd4





European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has warned against expecting the ECB to underwrite any potential loan for Ukraine as European leaders debate tapping Russian central bank funds frozen in the West as part of a so-called “reparations loan.” The ECB has earlier cautioned that borrowing against the immobilized assets risks eroding confidence in the euro.

“We are an area of the world which praises itself for respecting the rule of law,” Lagarde told a press conference in Frankfurt, as quoted by Politico. “It's not for the central bank to actually encourage [or]support a mechanism under which we would be called upon – and scheduled – to breach Article 123 of the Treaty,” she said, arguing the rule bans “monetary financing” – effectively central-bank funding of government spending – which such a Ukraine loan could amount to.



The EU Council has decided to link Ukraine to the European Defense Fund, Ukrainian Defense Minister Denis Shmigal has claimed. The European Defense Fund is the Commission's central defense initiative, though its results have largely been measured in strategy papers rather than deployable capabilities.

🇺🇦🇪🇺 Today's decision of the EU Council to incentivise defence investments and associate Ukraine with the European Defence Fund is a strategic investment in Europe's long-term security.Ukraine's defence industry is already an integral pillar of Europe's security architecture.…



Thousands of farmers from across Europe marched through Brussels today to protest European agricultural policy as the summit was taking place.



In case you're just joining us: • The EU's most powerful political operators are scrambling to try to secure a deal that will allow them to continue their posturing on Ukraine.  • While the hawks have insisted on issuing the “reparations loan” as soon as possible, the moderates have sounded the alarm over potential legal, financial, and reputational risks.  • Belgium remains one of the key opponents of the plan, and is being singled out for special attention. Belgian PM De Wever has had a face-to-face with Vladimir Zelensky. • The Russian central bank has significantly escalated the stakes by warned that it would seek damages from “European banks” and not only from Euroclear. • Reports are emerging of a German concession to share risk that could address Belgium's concerns. • The meeting attendees are now facing “many hours of increasingly technical discussions,” according to Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk.

European leaders appear “obsessed” with the idea of finding money to keep the war going, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has told the Russia 24 TV channel.



The discussion of financing Ukraine has reportedly started, according to Euractiv.

The confiscation or use of other states' sovereign assets undermines trust in the international financial system, former Ukrainian PM Nikolay Azarov has told RT.

The European Commission, instead of focusing on the economy and citizens' well-being, has focused on financing Kiev, he added. By doing that, they basically distract attention from internal crises in their countries, Azarov claimed.

Deutsche Welle has reported that Merz has made a concession to Belgium to spread the cost of Euroclear seizing Russian assets by making available Russian central bank assets held in Germany to fund Ukraine, reportedly a response to demands by Belgian PM Bart De Wever to mitigate the considerable risks to EU members.

The demonstration over the EU's potential trade deal with the South American bloc Mercosur has drawn farmers into the Belgian capital as EU leaders meet for a summit. The Mercosur deal and securing finance for Kiev are seen as two tests of the EU's fitness for purpose and its international standing. It looks like one of those summit pillars is on the brink of collapse, with no sign of any clarity on pushing through the theft of Russian assets.

“We're here to say no to Mercosur,” a Belgian dairy farmer reportedly told AFP. “It's like Europe has become a dictatorship,” he said, accusing European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen of seeking to “force the deal through.”

Ukraine's economy is heavily agricultural, and the prospect of Kiev joining the EU could sharply increase competition – potentially swelling the ranks of protesters.

18 December 2025

The Brussels summit got off to a rocky start for Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, one of the critics of using Russian assets to aid Ukraine. The prime minister said a vehicle carrying aircraft steps struck his plane at the airport in the Belgian capital, leaving it unable to fly.

No one “will leave the European Council without a solution for the funding for Ukraine for the next two years,” EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has proclaimed while speaking to reporters before the summit.

Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever has signaled that he is open to compromises, but “on a number of points which threaten the financial security of Europe and Belgium, it is not possible.”



Belgian PM Bart De Wever has skipped the arrivals at the EU's Brussels building, Euronews has reported, disappointing the vast majority of the EU press pool who have been primed to put some tough questions to him over his refusal to back asset theft.

The FT's Brussels correspondent Henry Foy wrote this morning that “De Wever will have to look Vladimir Zelensky in the eye” when refusing to back the theft of Russia's assets for the Ukrainian army.

Twelve EU members are currently in favor of the “reparations loan” scheme, while seven oppose it or want alternatives, and eight remain on the fence, Gaidar Institute researcher Kirill Chernovol has told TASS. He added EU rules require support from at least 15 states, meaning the plan would pass if three of the undecided countries vote in favor.

Though France is notoriously cagey about revealing exactly which banks hold Russian assets, the European Parliament published a report in September detailing what its research had found.

France, which even pro-EU correspondents have suspected of flip-flopping on asset theft, is thought to hold some €19 billion of Russian sovereign funds.



“The stability of the EU is at stake,” according to Prime Minister of Luxembourg Luc Frieden. He also warned that not only Hungary, but several other EU members could push back against decisions requiring unaniminty.

Ukraine will exhaust its funding within several months if the EU fails to agree on tapping Russian assets, Leo Litra, a visiting fellow with the European Security Programme, has told the Daily Telegraph.

“If this happens – and if Ukraine does not have a plan B – it means a defeat in the war,” he added.



The EU plan to finance Ukraine's war effort with immobilized Russian sovereign assets has backfired, intensifying divisions inside the bloc, Politico reported on Wednesday, citing public comments and people familiar with the matter.

“[The European Commission] created a monster, and they've been eaten by it,” one EU diplomat told the outlet.

Despite weeks of negotiations, efforts to win over Belgium have faltered, the report added. Belgium strongly opposes using the assets and has since drawn support from other member states.

Moscow has consistently warned of strong retaliatory actions if the EU goes ahead with its plan to steal sovereign Russian assets.

As an opening salvo, the Russian central bank last week filed a $230 billion lawsuit against Euroclear at a Moscow court.

A judgement against Euroclear carries risks of major reputational damage, which the Belgium-based depository has warned could potentially lead to its bankruptcy if other countries withdraw funds.

In a further harbinger of things to come, major ratings agency Fitch has placed Euroclear on notice for a possible downgrade, citing legal and liquidity risks linked to the EU's attempt to use Russian funds to keep Ukraine afloat.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Kiev facing growing discontent over corruption","https://www.rt.com/russia/629639-ukraine-corruption-consequences-svr/","Thu, 18 Dec 2025 14:26:00 GMT","

Ukraine is facing mounting internal strain as a major corruption scandal involving the country's leadership has deepened public war fatigue and damaged morale, Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) has said.

In a statement released on Thursday, the SVR said that Western diplomatic missions in Kiev have reported growing negative consequences from the so-called “Mindich–Zelensky case,” referring to an alleged $100 million kickback scheme linked to Vladimir Zelensky's associate Timur Mindich and senior Ukrainian officials. The scandal has already triggered the resignation of several high-ranking figures, including Zelensky's powerful chief of staff, Andrey Yermak.

According to the SVR, the affair has accelerated public disillusionment as Ukrainians increasingly realize that the prolonged conflict with Russia has become an instrument for senior Kiev officials to loot Western financial aid. 

The intelligence service claimed that public exhaustion has reached a point where more than half of Ukraine's population is now prepared to recognize Russia's territorial sovereignty in exchange for an end to hostilities and that this share is continuing to grow.

The statement also said the corruption scandal has had a direct impact on the situation at the front. Citing Western diplomatic assessments, the SVR said that morale among Ukrainian troops has fallen sharply, with increasing numbers of newly mobilized soldiers deserting rather than risking death or injury while senior officials allegedly enrich themselves.

According to the agency, the scale of desertion has become so pronounced that Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office has removed statistics on newly opened desertion cases from publicly available data.

Western diplomatic circles have also reportedly noted a rapid decline in the authority of Ukraine's commander-in-chief, Aleksandr Syrsky, a member of Zelensky's inner circle. Among officers, the SVR claimed, there is a belief that battlefield defeats could even prove beneficial if they lead to Syrsky's removal.

The agency added that Western diplomats believe that if the conflict ends, the corruption scandal will inevitably lead to a “harsh settling of scores within Ukrainian elites,” potentially including lynchings by an enraged public, with responsibility extending to Zelensky himself.

India has signed a trade agreement with Oman that allows duty-free access for most of the country's exports to the Gulf nation.

The announcement comes at a time when India is negotiating a trade pact with the US, its largest export market.

“Today, we are taking such a historic decision, the echo of which will be heard for many decades to come,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at the India-Oman Business Summit in Muscat. 

“Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement that is, CEPA, will give our partnership new confidence and new energy in the 21st century. This is a blueprint of our shared future. It will boost our trade… opening new doors to opportunities in every sector,” Modi added.

The agreement is expected to provide duty-free access for 98% of India's exports, including textiles, agriculture, and leather goods to Oman.

India will reduce tariffs on Oman's products, including dates, marbles, and petrochemical items.

New Delhi has also secured tariff elimination for its key labor-intensive sectors, including gems and jewellery, textiles, agricultural and engineering products, and auto through the deal, the PTI news agency reported.



India-Oman bilateral trade amounted to $10.5 billion in 2024-25.



India signed a trade pact with Mauritius in February 2021, followed by the UAE in February 2022, Australia in April 2022, the European Free Trade Association in February 2024, and the United Kingdom in July this year.

New Delhi is negotiating a trade deal with the US, which slapped 50% tariffs on the South Asian nation in August, half of it as punitive levies for its import of Russian oil.

Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump threatened to impose additional tariffs on India, accusing it of dumping rice into the US.

New Delhi is also seeking a preferential trade deal with Mexico in order to mitigate a tariff hike of up to 50%, as well as with a dozen other countries or trading blocs.

MOSCOW, December 18. /TASS/. The corruption scandal in Ukraine has, according to Western diplomatic sources, triggered a sharp decline in Ukrainian soldiers' morale on the front lines, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) said in a statement on Thursday.

""Ukrainian soldiers' morale at the front lines has plunged as a result of the corruption scandal in Ukraine, according to Western diplomatic sources,"" the statement reads. ""An increasing number of newly mobilized troops are deserting their positions, unwilling to risk death or injury to line the accounts of [Vladimir] Zelensky's team in foreign banks.""

""The unprecedented surge in desertion cases forced the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine to withdraw previously published statistics on newly opened criminal cases for reported AWOLs,"" the statement added.

On November 10, Ukraine's anti-corruption authorities carried out a large-scale operation to uncover a major corruption scheme in the energy sector. Mindich, who is called Zelensky's ""wallet,"" was the mastermind of the scheme.

Raids were conducted at the residences of Mindich, Justice Minister German Galushchenko, who was later dismissed, and the premises of the Energoatom company. According to the investigation, the participants of the criminal scheme laundered at least $100 million. Later, fragments of recordings of conversations in Mindich's apartment were published, in which corruption schemes were discussed. There are 1,000 hours of tapes in total.

On November 17, reports appeared that the then head of Zelensky's office Andrey Yermak might appear on the recordings under the pseudonym Ali Baba.

The corruption scandal triggered a deep crisis of the Ukrainian government - the work of parliament was blocked for some time, and some deputies, including from the ruling Servant of the People party, demanded Yermak's resignation. On November 28, his apartment was searched, and on the same day Zelensky fired him.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Comments follow reports that US president discussed idea with constitutional scholar Alan Dershowitz

US politics live – latest updates

The US would be “lucky” if Donald Trump remained in office for a constitutionally prohibited third term, the White House has said following revelations that he discussed the possibility with the lawyer and constitutional scholar Alan Dershowitz.

The bold assertion came despite successive polls showing plunging approval ratings for Trump amid widespread discontent over his administration's economic performance and lingering controversy over his links to the disgraced late financier and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

“There has never been an Administration that has accomplished as much in less than one year than the Trump Administration,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Axios.

“The American people would be lucky to have President Trump in office for even longer.”

Her comments came after Dershowitz, a prominent Trump supporter who acted as his defense lawyer after he was impeached by Congress during his first term, told the Wall Street Journal that he had informed the president that the constitution was unclear on whether he could run again.

That judgment is at odds with the view of most constitutional experts, who say the 22nd amendment unambiguously bars Trump from seeking a third term.

Dershowitz argued a different interpretation when presenting Trump with a copy of his book, entitled Could President Trump Constitutionally Serve a Third Term? – due to be published next year – in a meeting in the Oval Office.

“I said ‘it's not clear if a president can become a third term president and it's not clear if it's permissible,'” Dershowitz told the Journal.

He said Trump “found it interesting as an intellectual issue” and said he planned to read the book.

“Do I think he's going to run for a third term? No, I don't think he will run for a third term,” Dershowitz added.

However, Dershowitz's books lays out potential scenarios in which another Trump term could become a possibility – including having the electors in the electoral college abstaining from casting their votes and instead having the House of Representatives select the president.

The possibility of Trump seeking a third term has been a recurring theme since he returned to the White House for a second time last January.

Trump himself has sent out mixed signals. In October, he told journalists that the constitution was “pretty clear” that he is “not allowed to run”, although he has repeatedly said he would “love” to do so.

Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House of Representatives and one of his key allies on Capitol Hill, has said he “doesn't see a path” for Trump to run again.

Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, dismissed the prospect of a third Trump term in an interview with Vanity Fair published this week. She told the magazine that Trump “knows he can't run again” but is “having fun” with the idea because he knows it is “driving people crazy”.

At the same time, however, the Trump store has begun selling “Trump 2028” hats to his supporters.

Dershowitz told the Journal that, after meeting Trump, he showed a draft copy of his book to Miriam Adelson, the billionaire businesswoman who gave more than $100m to Trump-supporting political action committees during the 2024 presidential race, and who was visiting the White House for a Hanukah party.

According to him, she responded: “Is this real? Oh, my God, I hope this can happen.”

Later, when Trump brought Adelson on stage during the party, she confirmed she had spoken with Dershowitz. “I said, ‘Alan, I agree with you. So we can do it.'” Her comments were met by chants of “four more years” from the assembled crowd, at which point Adelson told Trump: “Think about it.”

Trump responded by telling the crowd: “She said, ‘think about it and I'll give you another $250m.'”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Drop is cause for public health concern, but news isn't all bad as acknowledging struggles is ‘a good sign', experts say

A record low proportion of Americans rate their mental health as “good” or “excellent” according to a Gallup poll released on Thursday.

The percentage of Americans polled who rated their mental health as “excellent” dropped below 30% for the first time this year while the number who rated their mental health as either “good” or “excellent” also dropped to a record low 72%.

These numbers began trending downward after the Covid-19 pandemic – before 2020, 42% or more of Americans consistently rated their mental health as “excellent”.

Experts said that, while this decline was cause for public health concern, the news was not all bad.

David Radley, senior scientist for health system tracking at the Commonwealth Fund, said that increased cultural openness surrounding mental health issues had probably meant Americans were more willing to admit they are struggling.

“In some ways, people acknowledging and being willing to talk about mental health struggles is actually a good sign,” Radley said.

Dr Lisa Rosenthal, a psychiatry professor at Northwestern University, agreed that the numbers “might be a signal that stigma is improving and people are more aware of psychiatric symptoms”.

Social media content about conditions like bipolar, complex PTSD, autism and ADHD shows a growing number of adults recognizing that difficulties they have faced their whole lives might be related to treatable mental health conditions.

A white paper from the non-profit Fair Health confirms that mental health related diagnoses have increased dramatically since 2019. Some of these conditions, like generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder, could be related to the stress of the pandemic. Others, like ADHD and bipolar, are currently understood to be lifelong conditions that are not dictated by circumstances such as a pandemic.

While declining stigma surrounding mental health probably contributed, Radley and Rosenthal agreed that the trauma of the Covid-19 pandemic, and other circumstances like uncertainty around politics and the economy, were having an enormous impact on the mental health of Americans. Rosenthal said that, to some degree, a decline in mental health was to be expected in these uncertain times.

“Not all unhappiness is something that needs to be treated, and some reactions are totally normal, even if they're very unpleasant,” Rosenthal said.

“We could talk for hours about the things that are making society unhappy. Obviously, politics is one thing that my patients are citing a lot, and that's patients from all backgrounds. But certainly, if you're an immigrant in the United States right now, your level of stress is extraordinarily high.”

Self-reported mental health declined more dramatically among groups that typically have higher self-rated mental health, including college educated adults and Republicans, according to the Gallup poll.

The number of Republicans who rated their mental health as “excellent” dropped from 53% during 2014-2019 to 40% in 2020-2025, aligning them more closely with Democrats. Typically, people rate their mental health better when their political party is in power, but both of the survey periods included Democratic and Republican presidencies.

The number of college graduates who rated their mental health as “excellent” dropped by 17% down to 36% between the two periods, aligning them more closely with their non-college educated peers, 30% of whom rated their mental health “excellent” in 2020-2025.

“[College graduates'] mental health worsened more, but it made them more equal to people without a college education. I'm not sure what that signal means, but I think it means we're all pretty unhappy,” Rosenthal said.

Rosenthal believes that, in addition to the uncertain circumstances Americans face, they are also becoming more disconnected.

“There's just so much anger that civility and discourse have been so disrupted. We can't talk to each other, and our sense of community and belonging has been altered dramatically,” she said.

But even as Americans are becoming more polarised, their mental outcomes are simultaneously becoming more aligned, the poll says.

“A lot of shoes feel like they're about to drop for a lot of people,” Radley said. “I don't think the shoes dropping discriminates.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Digital facilities that track wastage down to the gram have brought about behavioural change among users 

Min Geum-nan walks towards a metal bin beneath her apartment block in Gangdong district, eastern Seoul carrying a small bag of vegetable peelings. She taps her resident card on the reader, the lid swings open, she empties the contents and scans again and a digital screen flashes: 0.5kg.

“You have no choice but to pay attention because you can see exactly what you're wasting,” says Min, who has lived in the complex for 15 years and watched the system arrive in 2020.

Her routine is part of the dramatic national shift that has taken place over 20 years in South Korea, which recycled 96.8% of its 4.81 million tonnes of food waste in 2023, according to the ministry of climate, energy and environment – a transformation achieved through strict disposal rules, dedicated processing infrastructure and, increasingly, the use of radio frequency identification (RFID) bins that track waste down to the gram.

Food waste represents a major global climate challenge. More thana billion tonnes of food are thrown away each year worldwide, generating as much as 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Many countries still send the bulk of it to landfill.

South Korea, however, has been grappling with its waste issue for far longer than most countries after its main landfills reached capacity in the early 1990s. The crisis prompted big overhaul of the system and a nationwide pay-as-you-throw scheme in 1995. Residents were required to buy official rubbish bags, which reduced waste but also produced an unexpected issue: once recyclables such as paper were separated out, food scraps were left sitting wet in general waste, worsening odour problems.

The practice of sending food to landfill was banned altogether in 2005, and mandatory separation imposed. Collection methods varied in the early years, but standardisation accelerated after 2013 when the ocean dumping of leachate – the liquid from food waste processing – was banned, forcing it to be processed on land. Most areas used prepaid yellow bags, which encouraged frugality but created inconveniences: bags filled slowly, especially for small households, and residents disliked storing smelly waste during humid summers.

RFID bins, designed to make disposal both more precise and more transparent, were introduced in the early 2010s and are now widespread across cities. The fee – 130 won (about 7p) a kilo in Seoul – is automatically added to monthly maintenance bills.

For Min, the system changed behaviour at home. Every household has its own method for squeezing out moisture, she says. “If you don't remove water, it gets expensive. People press it, drain it and even use strainers. You learn your own tricks.” Being able to dispose of small amounts several times a day also means she no longer worries about smells or flies. “It's just more convenient,” she says. “I can come here anytime.”

Seoul operates 27,289 RFID units, serving 81.6% of apartment residents. Overall coverage across all housing types stands at 37.9%. Nationally, 150,738 units serve 8.54 million apartment households across 186 of the country's 229 municipalities. The shift has produced measurable results: since citywide implementation began in 2013, Seoul's food waste has fallen by 23.9% in a decade, from 3,181 tonnes a day to 2,419.

Studies of individual complexes show even steeper drops. Research across five Seoul apartment blocks found average reductions of 51% once residents could see – and pay for – the exact weight of what they threw away. In Siheung, a city south of Seoul, officials report a 41% cut across buildings that have adopted the technology.

From the bins, the waste – which amounts to about 300 tonnes a day from East Seoul – is taken to the Gangdong district resource circulation centre, where the processing machinery is built underground to minimise odour complaints. Incoming waste is shredded, and foreign materials such as metal fragments or onion mesh bags extracted before the waste moves deeper into the system.

It is then pressed to extract water, and the separated liquid feeds into anaerobic digesters. The resulting biogas powers the facility's drying process and odour control systems. The remaining solids – about 10% of the original volume – are dried, screened again for contaminants, and processed into chicken feed that is sold nationwide and even exported. National figures show that around 42% of recycled food waste becomes animal feed, 33% compost and 16% biogas.

It has an impact in people's kitchens too. For many families, Min says, the digital display above the bin has made portion control part of daily life. “If the family leaves food, I make less next time. You start thinking differently.” Cultural norms and regulations reinforce the habit, and community bulletin boards regularly remind residents of sorting rules. “People here are used to doing things properly,” she says.

Despite its success, the programme faces several challenges. Central government funding for installation ended in 2014, which means local authorities must finance any new machines themselves. Smaller or poorer municipalities have struggled to keep up, and several have reported delays or slower uptake because of budget constraints. Earlier generations of machines have also suffered from corrosion from the high salt content of Korean food, adding to replacement and maintenance costs.

Seoul is trying to push the system further. The city has pledged to cut food waste by 20% by 2030 compared with 2019 levels and to expand the use of RFID bins to 90% of apartment complexes. It also plans to introduce a points-based reward system from 2026, giving households credits they can use towards outgoings such as utility bills if they cut their waste.

Countries exploring pay-as-you-throw schemes often struggle with food waste, which is heavier, wetter and more variable than packaging or bottles. South Korea's model works because it combines several policies – landfill bans, mandatory recycling, precise measurement and dedicated processing plants – built over three decades.

For Min, though, the system remains disarmingly simple. “Separating food from other rubbish is just obvious,” she says. “It would be strange not to.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

SOUTH KOREA

Court removes police chief

The Constitutional Court yesterday formally removed the country's impeached police chief for deploying hundreds of officers to support ousted former president Yoon Suk-yeol's brief imposition of martial law in December last year. The court said Cho Ji-ho “actively disrupted” legislative activities by deploying hundreds of police officers to the National Assembly and trying to block lawmakers from reaching the main chamber to vote to lift Yoon's decree. Cho also infringed upon the independence of the National Election Commission by dispatching police to help the military's seizure of two election commission offices, the court said. Yoon said the actions were intended to investigate unsubstantiated claims of election fraud.

PM apologizes to Asians

Prime Minister Petteri Orpo on Wednesday apologized to Asian nations as he sought to contain a growing controversy over derogatory images posted by far-right members of parliament. Dubbed the “slanted eyes” scandal by media, the incident is the latest in a series of cases in which members of the Finns Party, a junior partner in the governing coalition, have been accused of posting or making racist remarks. “These posts do not reflect Finland's values of equality and inclusion,” Orpo said in statements released by embassies in China, Japan and South Korea. “Our message in Finland and to all our friends abroad is that the government takes racism seriously and is committed to combating the issue,” he said. The controversy arose earlier this month when the Miss Finland title holder was pictured pulling back her eyes in her friend's social media post captioned “eating with a Chinese person.”

China sues Missouri

Missouri's top prosecutor on Tuesday said China is suing after the state pressed federal officials for help collecting on an about US$25 billion court judgement related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway said in a statement that China is demanding a public apology from the state in a complaint filed in the Intermediate People's Court of Wuhan. The Chinese government is also seeking compensation equivalent to US$50.5 billion plus legal fees and the right to claim further compensation. “This lawsuit is a stalling tactic and tells me that we have been on the right side of this issue all along,” Hanaway said. At issue is a lawsuit Missouri filed alleging that China hoarded personal protective equipment during the early months of the pandemic, harming the state and its residents. A federal judge ruled for Missouri earlier this year after China declined to participate in the trial. Last month, Missouri asked the Department of State to notify China that it intends to pursue assets with full or partial Chinese government ownership to satisfy the judgement.

Poland has decided to start producing anti-personnel mines for the first time since the Cold War, and plans to deploy them along its eastern border and might export them to Ukraine, the deputy defense minister said.

Joining a broader regional shift that has seen almost all European countries bordering Russia, with the exception of Norway, announce plans to quit the global treaty banning such weapons, Poland wants to use anti-personnel mines to beef up its borders with Belarus and Russia.

“We are interested in large quantities as soon as possible,” Deputy Minister of National Defense Pawel Zalewski said.

The mines would be part of the “East Shield,” a defensive program aimed at fortifying Poland's borders with Belarus and the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, he said.

Asked whether production of mines could begin next year, once the withdrawal process from the Ottawa Convention was completed, Zalewski said: “I would very much like that... We have such needs.”

Poland began the process of withdrawal from the Ottawa Convention in August and had previously said it could start production of anti-personnel mines if needed, but that no formal decision had been taken. Zalewski's comments are the first confirmation from Warsaw that it will go ahead with the move.

Under the Landmine and Cluster Munitions Monitor, Poland told the UN in 1995 that it had abandoned production of anti-personnel mines in the mid-1980s and the export of such weapons had ceased.

Belma, the state-owned company that already supplies the Polish army with several other types of mines, said the country would be equipped with millions of mines under the East Shield program to secure its 800km eastern border.

“We are preparing for Polish demand ... to amount to 5 [million] to 6 million mines of all types,” Belma CEO Jaroslaw Zakrzewski said.

While the defense ministry has not placed an order yet, the company would be able to produce up to 1.2 million mines of all types, including anti-personnel mines, next year, he added.

Belma currently produces about 100,000 mines per year.

The minister said supplying mines to Ukraine would depend on production capacity.

“Our starting point is our own needs, but, for us, Ukraine is absolutely a priority because the European and Polish security line is on the Russia-Ukraine front,” Zalewski said.

Zakrzewski said that exports to Ukraine were possible and that NATO countries bordering Russia, including the Baltic states, had already signaled interest in buying anti-personnel mines.

Poland's own needs would take priority, but any excess production could be supplied to allies in the region, he said.

Earlier this year, Lithuania and Finland said they expected to start producing anti-personnel mines next year amid rising concerns about Russia since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Latvia and Estonia are also leaving the treaty, but have not announced production plans, although officials in Riga said they could launch manufacturing quickly if needed and Estonia sees it as a future option.

Polish anti-personnel mine production could begin once the treaty's six-month withdrawal period is completed on Feb. 20 next year, the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.

In an interview in Tokyo earlier this week, Kim Aris said he had not heard from his mother in years and believes she is being held incommunicado in the capital, Naypyidaw.
Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, was detained after a 2021 military coup that ousted her elected civilian government and sparked a civil war. She is serving a

Beijing has raged at Tokyo since Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi last month said that a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could trigger a military response from Japan.
China and Japan have long sparred over their painful history. China consistently reminds its people of the 1937 Nanjing Massacre, in which it says Japanese troops killed 300,000 people in what was then its capital.

Protests took place in the capital, Brasilia, and in other major cities across the nation, including Sao Paulo, Florianopolis, Salvador and Recife.

We are living in an age of global disruption. Supply chains are being reconfigured to avoid dependence on any one producer or country. Trade ties are being upended by high and unpredictable tariffs — and the threat of more. Longstanding alliances are being strained by doubts about partners' reliability.

Even the most amicable of neighbors, such as those in North America, are eyeing each other with suspicion. Many of the structures that, however imperfect, delivered relative peace, stability and prosperity for more than eight decades have been so hamstrung that they can hardly be counted on to function at all.

Of course, not all disruption is bad. As this year's Nobel laureate economists — Philippe Aghion, Peter Howitt and Joel Mokyr — taught us, “creative destruction” is vital to economic dynamism and innovation. A stable world order is built on creation, not destruction: the formation of strong multilateral institutions, robust alliances, resilient trade relationships and durable shared norms, founded on the rule of law. The same is true of a stable regional order — a lesson the countries of the Indo-Pacific region should take to heart.

Illustration: Mountain People

As it stands, the Indo-Pacific lacks many of the institutions and alliances that are teetering elsewhere. This gives regional leaders an opportunity. Similar to the allied countries after World War II, Indo-Pacific governments can, to borrow a phrase from former US secretary of state Dean Acheson, be “present at the creation” of a new economic, security and diplomatic architecture capable of underpinning peace and stability in the vast region. 

At a time when revanchism is on the march in Ukraine, and China is seeking hegemony in Asia and beyond, the need for such an architecture is abundantly clear. Where security is concerned, complacency is never warranted. Then-British prime minister Neville Chamberlain taught us as much in 1938, when he sold out the seemingly faraway Czechoslovakia to Adolf Hitler, triggering a chain of events that culminated a year later in the outbreak of the wider war that Chamberlain thought appeasing Hitler would prevent.

Rather than turn a blind eye to proliferating instability, Indo-Pacific leaders should seek to realize late Japanese prime minister Abe Shinzo's vision of a region that is open, united, stable and secure. This process should build on existing frameworks, such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, (Quad) made up of Japan, Australia, India and the US. Created as a multilateral response to the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the Quad was relaunched under Abe's leadership in 2017 as a platform for strategic cooperation, including joint military training and intelligence sharing.

That cooperative framework should be expanded. Perhaps the most obvious candidate for membership is South Korea, which shares many security concerns with Japan and the US, holds military exercises with both countries, and increasingly shares intelligence with Japan.

Saudi Arabia, which has been engaged in its own powerful military modernization, could be welcomed into an Indo-Pacific framework. Given the importance of oil exports to its economy, safeguarding maritime security in the Indian Ocean is of paramount interest. As the Gulf's dominant economy, it has plenty to offer Indo-Pacific partners, particularly as an entry point for other Gulf states.

No discussion of an Indo-Pacific institutional architecture is complete without ASEAN, which has earned a reputation for advancing its members' economic and political development through cooperation, without interfering with their sovereignty. Over the past year, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who held ASEAN's rotating chair until the end of October, sought to fortify the 11-member bloc through greater economic and commercial engagement, including increased investment ties.

At the same time, Anwar worked to deepen ASEAN's relationships with the rest of Asia, including China, as well as with the US. He also contributed to the bloc's expansion. By welcoming Timor-Leste as a member, ASEAN reduced the risk of a revival of tensions with Indonesia and extended its influence deeper into the western Pacific.

A bold expansion into the Indian Ocean would open unique opportunities for ASEAN and enhance Indo-Pacific stability. Sri Lanka's accession would mean gaining an ASEAN outpost in the middle of the Indian Ocean, which would facilitate increased trade and investment ties with India, Africa and the Gulf. 

It is good news that Sri Lanka, said to be considering a bid for membership in the bloc, is already seeking to strengthen economic and diplomatic ties with ASEAN countries through a sectoral dialogue partnership.

Despite its successes, ASEAN is under considerable pressure. Beyond the civil war ravaging Myanmar, border clashes between Cambodia and Thailand — which Anwar helped to tamp down earlier this year — erupted again. However, this conflict might not be intractable. A contact group composed of Japan and India, working alongside Anwar, might provide the diplomatic heft necessary to resolve the dispute. As the old adage goes, sometimes the only way to solve a problem is to broaden it.

Other piecemeal efforts to strengthen regional ties are gaining steam. As punishing US tariffs undermine the competitiveness of Indian exports, Indian firms are increasingly turning to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a bridge to US markets, a steppingstone toward deeper engagement with the Arab world, and a source of capital for Indian industry.

India and the UAE are reshaping Indo-Pacific trade in line with Abe's vision, articulated two decades ago, of a “broader Asia” formed by a “dynamic coupling” of the region's countries. However, fully realizing that vision would require governments to strengthen their commitment to fostering an open, rules-based maritime order, upholding free trade and freedom of navigation and nurturing economic security and prosperity, from the east coast of Africa to the island nations of the South Pacific.

Indo-Pacific unity is not only possible. In our age of disruption, it is essential. And it is being built the only way it can be: from within.

In a speech at the event, Lai highlighted similarities in the geopolitical challenges faced by Israel and Taiwan, saying that the two countries “stand on the front line against authoritarianism.”
Lai noted how Taiwan had “immediately condemned” the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas and had provided humanitarian aid.
Lai was heavily criticized from some quarters for standing with AIPAC and Israel.

The figures attracted international attention since they were in October published in a Reuters report, which highlighted the fragility and structural challenges of Taiwan's energy sector, accumulated through long-standing policy choices. The nation's overreliance on natural gas is proving unstable and inadequate.

Three Russian border guards briefly entered Estonian territory without permission on the morning of Dec. 17, the ERR broadcaster reported, citing Estonia's Interior Ministry.

Igor Taro, the interior minister of the Baltic nation, said it remains unclear whether the incident was intentional but emphasized that there is no threat to Estonia's security.

The news comes amid increasingly frequent cases of suspected Russian provocations and aerial incursions on NATO territory, particularly in the Baltic region.

The incident occurred in eastern Estonia at the Narva River, which divides the two countries. 

Tallinn said its border security personnel observed a group of Russian border guards crossing the control line at a breakwater situated where the Narva River meets Lake Peipus.

The three Russian personnel returned to Russian territory after approximately 20 minutes, according to Estonian authorities.

The Estonian Border Guard has deployed additional border patrols, and Estonian officials are scheduled to meet with Russian representatives on Dec. 18.

The Estonian Foreign Ministry said it would also summon a Russian envoy to explain the incident.

Estonia, a NATO and EU member sharing a 294-kilometer (183-mile) border with Russia, has reported a number of similar incidents in recent months.

A Russian coast guard cutter was spotted on the Narva River flying the banner of the Russian Wagner mercenary company in early November, and an unusual movement of Russian troops at the border was recorded in October.

On Sept. 19, three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets were said to have entered the Baltic nation's airspace for 12 minutes.

The string of violations has fueled tensions between Russia and NATO as Western leaders warn about the possibility of an open clash within the next five years.

Kyiv has signed several new defense agreements with Berlin totaling 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion), Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on Dec. 17, a day after the Ramstein-format meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG).

Under the new agreements, Germany will provide Ukraine with a ""long-term"" supply of spare parts for Patriot air defense systems currently in use in Ukraine.

""This will enable faster repair, modernization, and restoration of existing systems,"" Ukraine's Defense Ministry highlighted in a news release.

Amid an increase in the frequency and severity of Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities, Kyiv has long called on Western allies to support its air defense capabilities. 

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius confirmed on Dec. 17 that Berlin has delivered two previously pledged Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine earlier this year, as well as its ninth IRIS-T battery. 

In addition to the commitments to Ukraine's air defense, Berlin will also assist in the procurement of Ukrainian-made drones, in a deal worth €200 million ($234 million) as well as the production of 200 Bohdana self-propelled howitzer systems mounted on top of the German-made Mercedes-Benz Zetros chassis. 

The deal also includes the delivery off advanced electronic warfare systems as well as the co-production of reconnaissance drones between Quantum Systems, a Germany-based tech company, and Ukrainian firm Frontline Robotics — in a first of its kind foreign-based production of drones for Ukraine's military.

The full details of the agreements were not publicly released.

In addition to the new agreements, Pistorius announced earlier in the day that Germany would ""transfer a significant number of AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles"" to Ukraine next year. The Sidewinder is an air-to-air missile that can be used by helicopters and fighter jets; however, Ukraine has also been repurposing these munitions for use on ground-based platforms.

Last month, the Bundestag committed to allocate €11.5 billion ($13.4 billion) in aid to Ukraine for 2026 — softening the blow for Kyiv's current $61 billion budget gap in 2026 and 2027. 

European allies have continued to increase aid funding to Ukraine amid a halt in the deliveries of financial aid from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. 

European leaders will decide on Dec. 18–19 whether to proceed with a ""reparations loan,"" a plan to lend up to 210 billion euros in frozen Russian assets to Ukraine. Without extra financing, Kyiv will run out of cash by spring next year.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

President Volodymyr Zelensky held talks with European leaders during an EU summit in Brussels on Dec. 18, where a major funding package for Kyiv is at the top of the agenda.

During the two-day summit on Dec. 18–19, EU leaders are expected to decide whether to proceed with a ""reparations loan,"" a plan to lend up to 210 billion euros ($250 billion) backed by frozen Russian assets to Ukraine. Without additional financing, Kyiv will likely run out of cash by spring next year.

Belgian Prime Minister Bart de Wever has expressed opposition to the plan, citing legal and financial risks. Belgium is home to Euroclear, the financial institution that holds most of the frozen assets.

Ahead of the event, De Wever said he was open to ""compromises"" but emphasized he cannot accept steps that would jeopardize Belgium's financial security.

Zelensky said that he and De Wever had a ""good"" conversation on the sidelines of the summit, noting that the Belgian leader understands the necessity for supporting Ukraine.

Speaking at the press conference in Brussels, the Ukrainian president warned that without the next tranche of EU funding by spring, Ukraine's ability to produce drones and conduct long-range strikes on Russian energy infrastructure would be significantly constrained.

He called upon EU leaders to adopt a decision by the end of this year and stressed that the status of the reparations loan should not be part of the peace talks, so that Moscow cannot use it to pressure Kyiv.

""We don't want this instrument to end up in Russian hands. And we believe they'll do all they can to block it,"" the president said.

Earlier, Zelensky said that without the reparations loan, ""Ukraine will face serious problems.""

If Ukraine does not receive the funds, Russian President Vladimir Putin will be emboldened to continue the war and ""will not seek diplomacy or dialogue at all,"" Zelensky said in comments for journalists en route to Brussels.

As the summit progressed, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced a ""breakthrough"" at the EU summit, saying that a ""declaration that we all want to use Russian assets for Ukraine was made.""

The Polish leader added that ""technical discussions"" are still needed because ""the countries which are the most at risk of Russian financial reprisals in the future, mainly Belgium, but not only, are looking for safeguards.""

Seeking to unlock funds for Ukraine, European leaders have sought to sway Belgium's position, proposing additional guarantees while emphasizing the ramifications of failing to reach a consensus.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Dec. 15 that, if the reparations loan fails, ""the European Union's ability to act will be severely damaged for years, if not for much longer.""

""Now we have a simple choice: either money today, or blood tomorrow,"" Tusk said ahead of the summit. ""I'm not talking about Ukraine only, I'm talking about Europe.""

EU leaders have been discussing two options for long-term financing for Kyiv: the reparations loan and budget borrowing. Kaja Kallas, the bloc's top diplomat, estimated the chances of a consensus on the reparations loan as ""50/50.""

""We will never leave this Council without a final solution,"" European Council President Antonio Costa vowed.

Joining the push, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers appealed to Belgium to seek an agreement with the European Commission to unlock the funds.

""Leveraging these assets could enable Ukraine to purchase critical defensive systems, including through the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative, and help Ukraine manage a looming fiscal shortfall,"" read a letter addressed to Belgium's ambassador in the U.S., Frederic Bernard, and dated Dec. 16.

""Providing additional financial support is of paramount importance for the sake of Ukraine, for a Europe that is whole and free, and one day at peace — and for the defense of democracy everywhere,"" said the paper obtained by the Kyiv Independent.

Other EU members, including Italy, Malta, and Bulgaria, joined Belgium in voicing reservations about the reparations loan and called for alternative solutions.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, broadly seen as the most Kremlin-friendly EU leader, has staunchly opposed the plan, calling using Russian assets to fund Ukraine a ""declaration of war.""

In turn, Andrej Babis, Czechia's new prime minister, said he does not oppose using Russian assets to fund Ukraine but ruled out providing guarantees that would burden the national budget.

Russia has warned Europe of repercussions if the plan for the reparations loan proceeds. While the country's central bank filed a $229 billion lawsuit against Euroclear, the Kremlin is reportedly exploring the seizure of remaining Western assets in Russia.

The Trump administration has announced a massive package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10-billion that includes medium-range missiles, howitzers and drones, a move that is sure to infuriate China.

The State Department announced the sales late Wednesday during a nationally televised address by President Donald Trump, who made scant mention of foreign policy issues and did not speak about China or Taiwan at all. U.S.-Chinese tensions have ebbed and flowed during Trump's second term, largely over trade and tariffs but also over China's increasing aggressiveness toward Taiwan, which Beijing has said must reunify with the mainland.

The eight arms sales agreements announced Wednesday cover 82 high-mobility artillery rocket systems, or HIMARS, and 420 Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS – similar to what the U.S. had been providing Ukraine during the Biden administration to defend itself from Russia – worth more than $4-billion. They also include 60 self-propelled howitzer systems and related equipment worth more than $4-billion and drones valued at more than $1-billion.

Other sales in the package include military software valued at more than $1-billion, Javelin and TOW missiles worth more than $700-million, helicopter spare parts worth $96-million and refurbishment kits for Harpoon missiles worth $91-million.

In separate but nearly identical statements, the State Department said the sales serve “U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.”

“The proposed sale(s) will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,” the statements said.

Under federal law, the U.S. is obligated to assist Taiwan with its self-defence, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China, which has vowed to take Taiwan by force, if necessary.

The boost in military assistance to Taiwan was previewed in legislation adopted by Congress that Trump is expected to sign shortly.

Last week, the Chinese embassy in Washington denounced the legislation, known as the National Defense Authorization Act, saying it unfairly targeted China as an aggressor.

“The bill has kept playing up the ‘China threat' narrative, trumpeting for military support to Taiwan, abusing state power to go after Chinese economic development, limiting trade, economic and people-to-people exchanges between China and the U.S., undermining China's sovereignty, security and development interests and disrupting efforts of the two sides in stabilizing bilateral relations,” Beijing's embassy in Washington said after the legislation passed the House.

“China strongly deplores and firmly opposes this,” it said.

The U.S. Senate passed the bill Wednesday.

Shaquille Morgan is a writer, community organizer and policy consultant in social housing. He is the author of the book The Space Between and runs the blog lifeunravelled.ca.

In early December, Netflix announced that it would be acquiring Warner Bros. from Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. (WBD) for US$72-billion. The deal includes Warner's film and television studios, HBO Max, and HBO, meaning Netflix will own the company's critically acclaimed catalogue of movies and television shows like The Wire, Game of Thrones, and The Sopranos. 

In Canada, content from HBO is exclusively licensed to Bell Media for its streaming platform, Crave. When the deal is finalized, HBO content will be offered to Netflix subscribers, increasing Netflix's market share in the streaming space and making Crave redundant. 

So, unless the Competition Bureau of Canada obliges Netflix to sell its HBO assets, the writing is on the wall. And it reads: Crave – your days are numbered. 

The acquisition of Warner Bros. by Netflix caught the entertainment industry by surprise. The deal likely requires approval by antitrust regulators at the U.S. Department of Justice to be finalized, but Netflix expects this to come after WBD splits the company in two in late 2026.

Warner Bros. Discovery board asks investors to reject Paramount's hostile bid, go with Netflix deal

Key to the DOJ's review is the question of whether the transaction will allow Netflix to monopolize the streaming industry. Currently, Netflix leads the world in subscribers, while HBO Max (including Discovery+ content) ranks within the top five. With this purchase, Netflix's already large market share would be significantly over 30 per cent, further outpacing its competitors like Prime, Disney+, and Paramount+.

Canada faces an analogous question but with stiffer consequences for Crave, the country's premier domestic streaming company. Today, Netflix is the most subscribed streaming service in Canada, with about nine million subscribers. Crave, on the other hand, has 4.3 million subscribers. While it's unknown how many customers subscribe to both services, many Canadians use Crave specifically to access HBO's catalogue. 

Should the DOJ review and approve the deal, the Competition Bureau must require Netflix to sell HBO assets to a Canadian buyer to preserve competition in the Canadian market. I say this because for Netflix to optimize the acquired content's value, their best move is to offer it on their own platform. Subsequently, it's likely that Netflix will either pay to void their contract with Bell Media or allow it to expire.

The impact on Crave will be mass migration to Netflix as content becomes consolidated and subscribers seek out cost savings. The scale of this exodus could be in the hundreds of thousands, putting Crave in a compromising position and jeopardizing its survival. This is particularly concerning because Bell Media expanded its long-term partnership agreement with WBD in 2024. 

The deal would then leave Crave with a content gap that can't meaningfully be filled through other partnerships or even Canadian television shows. This might sound dismissive of Canadian content, but what gives Crave its value proposition and market edge is HBO Max's content. That content provides the company with direct access to the Canadian market without WBD having to build its own infrastructure and navigate government regulations. It's a mutually beneficial relationship with Crave arguably gaining the most. 

Now although Crave is also home to Canadian television shows, they lack the notoriety and volume required to live up to HBOs seasoned content library. In an era where quantity, variety, and actor reputations drive subscribership, this doesn't bode well for Crave. Neither does it bode well for Canadian television and film as HBO was to co-produce original Canadian and Bell Media content to be licensed for use on WBD platforms outside of Canada. 

Although the Warner acquisition is not a done deal at the time of writing, it looks likely to proceed. In the meantime, Canada has time to prepare for a successful outcome. If it's approved, the bureau must require Netflix to sell HBO to preserve market competition. In the short run, the public might lose, given the higher costs to maintain multiple subscriptions; but in the long run, we avoid monopolistic price setting and can build Canadian talent. To erase the writing on the wall, that cost is a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

The Bundestag budget committee has signed off on more than €50 billion in military purchases. The Cabinet is proposing tighter rules for welfare recipients. 

This blog has been closed. Thank you for reading.

Here is a roundup of news in Germany on Wednesday, December 17.

A 40-year-old is being investigated for having allegedly played banned neo-Nazi music at a Christmas market in Otterndorf, northern Germany.

According to reports, tracks by a banned neo-Nazi band were played in public, as well as antisemitic songs.

Police secured the USB stick with the music and are looking into whether the suspect worked for an external company hired to be responsible for the music at the market.

Playing the songs in public is illegal, while owning them is not.

The topping-out ceremony for a staff building at a future German military base in Lithuania took place on Wednesday — ten months ahead of schedule.

""This is a huge step forward for our country and for the deterrence of our region,"" said Lithuanian Defense Minister Robertas Kaunas.

Once fully complete and operational, the base in Rudninkai, just south of the capital Vilnius and close to the border with Belarus, will become home to the German Bundeswehr's 45th Armored Brigade and its commander, General Christoph Huber.

""I am deeply impressed by what I have seen here today,"" said Huber, thanking the construction companies. ""These works are of great importance because it will be our home, my home, the home of my soldiers.""

The brigade is expected to be fully operational by 2027 with a total strength of 4,800 soldiers and 200 civilian employees.

""We are very grateful to Germany for taking the lead and taking responsibility for regional security,"" Kaunas told the dpa news agency.

The construction of the facility is the largest military infrastructure project in Lithuania's history and is being carried out in phases.

In the first phase, administrative buildings, accommodation for 600 soldiers, vehicle storage and maintenance halls and other buildings are being erected on a site covering almost 56,000 square meters.

In a second phase, the remaining infrastructure of the military town is to be built on an area of 170 hectares.

US tech and e-commerce firm Amazon is not allowed to impose additional advertising on German customers who pay for its Prime Video streaming service, a court in Munich ruled on Wednesday.

Back at the start of 2024, Amazon informed Prime customers who had paid for ad-free streaming that they would start seeing a limited number of commercials. Amazon said customers could continue streaming ad-free for an extra €2.99 ($3.50) per month.

Germany's Federation of German Consumer Organizations (Bundesverband der Verbraucherzentralen or VZBV) took Amazon to court in the southern city of Munich, which found that the tech giant was in breach of fair trading laws and didn't have the right to unilaterally alter the terms of its contract with customers.

The court said that, when entering into the contract, customers had expected an ad-free service. And because Amazon had made ad-free programing the ""subject of the contract,"" the company must be held to it.

""[The ruling] shows that additional advertising on Amazon Prime Video should not have occurred without the involvement of the affected consumers,"" said Ramona Pop, chairwoman of the VZBV, who described the judgement as ""very important.""

Amazon has now been instructed to send customers a ""correction letter,"" but the judgement is not yet final, and Amazon may appeal the decision: ""We will review the judgement to determine our next steps,"" said the company spokesman.

""Although we respect the court's decision, we don't agree with the reasoning. We informed our customers about the advertising update to Prime Video transparently, in advance and in accordance with the law,"" he added.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said that financial support for Ukraine and economic sanctions on Russia are not enough when it comes to protecting both Ukraine and Europe from Russian aggression.

If democracies are to be able to defend themselves against autocracies, he told the German parliament, then they need to be better armed. ""It's as simple as that,"" he said.

Germany has opened a new national drone defense center (Gemeinsames Drohnenabwehrzentrum or GDAZ) which is intended to improve cooperation between the federal government, state governments, the police and the armed forces in the interception and elimination of drones.

Inaugurating the new center in Berlin on Wednesday, Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt said that, while Germany is not at war, ""we are the targets of hybrid war tactics, almost every day.""

Chancellor Friedrich Merz has blamed a series of recent drone incidents near sensitive facilities such as airports and military bases in Germany and elsewhere in Europe on Russia.

""Every day Russia is transgressing with hybrid attacks, drone overflights, killings, sabotage, spying, cyberattacks and targeted disinformation,"" he told the lower house of the German parliament, the Bundestag, on Wednesday, accusing Moscow of wanting to ""expand its area of influence well beyond its own borders into Europe.""

A major problem hampering Germany's drone defense has been uncertainty regarding responsibility for combatting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). While the armed forces (Bundeswehr) cannot constitutionally be deployed inside Germany, local police (Landespolizei) don't have the equipment or capability to shoot down drones. And if an airport or train station is threatened, they come under the jurisdiction of the federal police (Bundespolizei).

""The borders between internal and external security are becoming more and more blurred,"" said Armin Schuster, regional interior minister for the eastern state of Saxony. ""The new drone defense center combines the civilian and military capabilities of both central and state government.""

In order to enable future domestic Bundeswehr deployments to combat such hybrid threats, the government is in the process of updating Germany's air defense legislation, reforms which are currently passing through parliament. However, the new drone defense center will be operational as early as January.

""We're just getting it done,"" said Joachim Herrmann, regional interior minister for the southern state of Bavaria, at the inauguration in Berlin. ""In the current situation, citizens quite rightly don't want us to be having these discussions about jurisdictions.""

Rosa von Praunheim, one of Germany's most productive and controversial film-makers, has died in Berlin.

The 83-year-old had married his life partner just days earlier.

The director had over 150 movies under his belt, focusing on gay, lesbian and trans topics.

Born Holger Radtke, he took on the name Rosa (pink in German) to remind people of the pink triangles homosexuals were forced to wear in Nazi concentration camps. Praunheim refers to the Frankfurt neighborhood where he grew up.

Volkswagen on Wednesday officially started manufacturing operations at the first plant operated by its battery subsidiary PowerCo at the company's premises in the central city of Salzgitter.

Chief executive Oliver Blume described the new plant as a ""signal for Europe"" and a key element of the group's strategy.

He said Volkswagen had become the first European carmaker to establish its own development and production of battery cells, something that would strengthen its position and independence on the global market, currently dominated by China and other Asian manufacturers.

Although it will start by producing just a few hundred battery cells per day, that volume is eventually to rise to 60,000-70,000 cells daily at the Salzgitter facility alone.  

VW plans to establish factories on the same model at two other sites: one in the Spanish city of Valencia and the other in St Thomas in Canada. They are scheduled to begin production within the next two years.

The manufacturing launch comes as the EU has watered down its previously planned phaseout of combustion vehicles, meaning that some types of car with combustion engines will still be able to be registered after the deadline of 2035.

However, PowerCo boss Frank Blome said that the recent change in Brussels did not change the company's view on the future of electric vehicles.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz would likely send troops to Ukraine to secure a truce if necessary, although he wouldn't spell it out in parliament. 

While taking questions from lawmakers in the Bundestag today, he left no doubt that he would support Kyiv. But the chancellor seemed to fear a toxic public debate at home over German boots on the ground. Rightly so, Germany is a country still struggling to get used to the idea that security is no longer something provided by the United States.

A lawmaker from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, Markus Frohnmaier, asked Merz whether Germany would send troops to Ukraine.  

""There are questions in this world that are not as simple as you might imagine. This question is one of them,"" Merz said.  

""We are talking about security guarantees for Ukraine after a ceasefire that must be agreed with Russia. I would add that, at least as long as I have a say in the matter, we will not repeat the mistakes of 2014 by continuing to expose Ukraine to Russia's influence without security guarantees,"" he added. 

During the Ukraine negotiations in Berlin earlier this week, Merz signed off on the declaration of the coalition of the willing that foresees a European force to secure peace in Ukraine. 

The fact that the far-right AfD is pushing the chancellor to make concrete commitments before a truce is even on the cards illustrates that German troops in Ukraine could fast become an issue for regional elections in Germany next year — a political risk for Merz.

The budget committee of the Bundestag has given the green light to an expenditure of more than €50 billion ($59 billion) for military weapons and equipment.

The Defense Ministry has confirmed that it is the largest one-off sum ever approved for the use of the Bundeswehr, or German armed forces.

The largest item on the list submitted by the Bundeswehr is that for uniforms and protective equipment for individual soldiers.

The list also includes an order for 200 Puma infantry fighting vehicles worth €4 billion.

The approval comes as Germany boosts its defense capabilities in response to the threat of Russian aggression.

The country has invested more on the military over the last three years than in the eight years prior to that, noted DW's chief political correspondent Nina Haase. 

Military expenditure in Germany has been exempted from the constraints otherwise put on public debt for the next few years.

The high sums for uniforms and protective equipment come as the Bundeswehr aims to increase the number of active soldiers from the current some 184,000 to at least 450,000 by 2035.

The German government has approved a draft law allowing regular hunting seasons for wolves in areas with a high-density wolf population.

The draft law would allow for the shooting of ""problem"" wolves that can break through fences intended to protect livestock.

The legislation would go further than the EU's habitats directive, under which the animals may be killed only under specific exceptional circumstances. 

 ""The return of the wolf to Germany and Europe is a success of species conservation policy, but its increasing spread has also led to conflicts with livestock farming and with parts of the population,"" said government spokesman Stefan Kornelius, shortly after the Cabinet approved the draft law.

Wolves have killed increasing numbers of livestock in Germany in recent years, causing divisions between farmers on the one hand, and conservationists who see the return of wolves to the country as a win for the environment on the other.

Wolves in the wild were extinct in Germany for some 150 years but were reintroduced about 20 years ago. 

The German government has decided on renaming the current ""Bürgergeld"" welfare program and on the introduction of stricter conditions for the 5.5 million current recipients of the payments.

The reforms have met with resistance from members of the Social Democrats (SPD), the junior partner in Germany's coalition government, though the draft bill including the changes has been proposed by Labor Minister Bärbel Bas from the same party.

The changes, which have been criticized by several charitable groups, are not expected to bring large savings, with €86 million ($101 million) less in welfare payments expected in 2026 and just €70 million less in the following year.

Bas said on Wednesday that the reform aimed ""to get people into permanent employment"" but added that those who need help would still be able to ""rely on the support of the state"" in the future.

The changes still have to be approved by parliament.

Single recipients of Bürgergeld are paid €563 ($660) a month, which costs the government about €50 billion a year.

Winter travel and leisure activities are being wound back by many people in Germany as rising costs and economic uncertainty make themselves increasingly felt, a survey has shown.

The poll by YouGov, commissioned by the DPA news agency, found that 15% of respondents were planning to trim their holiday plans, while another 15% wanted to cut back on leisure activities.

Around 25% said they would not spend as much in restaurants.

However, some 51% said they would keep up their normal winter leisure expenses.

But the survey also found that by far the most people in Germany, 81%, were not planning on any form of winter holiday, although Germans are known for their love of summer travel.

Nonetheless, the drop in spending by Germans could negatively affect the hospitality sector in neighboring countries, with almost half of hotel guests last winter in Austria coming from Germany, for example, and some 12% in Switzerland.

Two EU Galileo satellites are headed to space on board a European rocket, marking a break from the reliance on the US — and pre-invasion Russia — for such launches over the past seven years.  

The two satellites were built by the German company OHB, a fact highlighted by Germany's research, technology and space minister.

You can read more about the groundbreaking launch in this article by DW's Alex Berry: Ariane 6 rocket launches with EU Galileo satellite

 

The German government intends to ease the currently strict rules protecting wolves, with the Cabinet discussing the possible inclusion of the animal in the list of permissible hunting targets under certain conditions.

The measures under discussion would mean that states with large wolf populations, such as Brandenburg, Lower Saxony and Saxony, would be permitted to cull wolves if the situation demanded.

Those wolves that have shown themselves capable of getting through protective fences would be able to be shot dead under the proposed measures.

Currently, there are 209 packs of wolves living in Germany. In 2024, some 4,300 livestock animals, mostly sheep and goats, were killed by wolves.

The federal Cabinet is expected to approve a reform of Germany's ""Bürgergeld"" (Citizens' Income) welfare scheme, including a change of name to ""Grundsicherung"" (Basic Security).

Under the stricter rules that are proposed, welfare recipients could see their payments reduced or even cut completely if they fail to accept suitable job offers. There would also be reductions if recipients do not turn up to appointments at the job center.

The welfare rights group AWO has criticized the planned reforms, saying the debate about ""how to save money at the cost of the poorest"" was ""shameful for a rich country like Germany.""

AWO President Michael Gross said that the proposals distracted from the real problems facing impoverished families in Germany, noting that food prices had gone up by more than 36% in the past five years.

""So while families are worrying about being able to put a warm meal for their children on the table at the end of the month, the government is looking at punishing missed appointments at the job center by cutting housing payments. That is a catastrophic debate,"" he said.

Currently, some 5.5 million people in Germany receive Bürgergeld.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'dw.com'}","world"

President Donald Trump has made a speech boasting of his progress to make US ""hottest country anywhere"" amid a national affordability crisis.

It was the roundup of Donald Trump's speech and other news in the United Stateson December 17, 2025. This blog is now closed.

 

US President Donald Trump has added often unflattering descriptions to portraits of former presidents included in the ""Presidential Walk of Fame"" that he established at the White House a couple of months ago.

Trump's predecessor for his second term, President Joe Biden — who is represented by a picture of an autopen signing his name rather than a portrait — reads: ""Sleepy Joe Biden was, by far, the worst President in American history.""

The description falsely accuses Biden of winning the ""most corrupt election ever"" and claims he made ""unprecedented use of the autopen.""

Former President Barack Obama, the US' first Black leader, is labeled as ""one of the most divisive political figures in American history.""

The plaque below former President George W. Bush's portrait claims that Bush ""started wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, both of which should not have happened.""

However, one president, the incumbent, receives particularly fulsome praise spread over two displays marking his two terms.

In the first, Trump is lauded for having created ""the Greatest Economy in the History of the World"" and for what is described as a ""landslide"" victory in 2016 elections, where he received a vote of 304-227 at the Electoral College.

The second records his popular-vote victory in 2024 — which he failed to achieve in 2016 — and adds: ""THE BEST IS YET TO COME.""

According to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, the ""plaques are eloquently written descriptions of each President and the legacy they left behind.""   

""As a student of history, many were written directly by the President himself,"" she said.

The descriptions do, indeed, bear the personal mark of Trump in their bombast, mockery and maverick use of capitalization.

 

Trump used a significant part of his speech to praise his record on immigration. 

He pointed to his efforts on tightening the US border and referred to mass deportations, saying his administration was removing criminals. 

Trump also slammed former President Joe Biden for letting the United States be ""invaded by an army of 25 million people"" during his term. 

Figures in the Trump administration have widely used this number since mid-2024 when Trump was running his presidential campaign. 

But this number has widely been debunked by fact checkers. 

It's estimated that some 7.4 million undocumented immigrants crossed illegally in the US under Biden. 

If undocumented migrants who cross at legal checkpoints are included, this figure would rise to just over 10 million people, according to broadcaster NBC and other US outlets.

In his Wednesday speech, Trump claimed that energy prices, including gasoline, had dropped and that they would continue to drop more.

But they aren't at the levels he claims.

The president said the national average gas price was $2.50 per gallon (around €.67 per liter). But the average nationally is $2.90 per gallon for the week ending December 15.

That's according to the -Energy Information Administration, a government statistical agency.

Without providing evidence, Trump also said household energy costs have dropped by $3,000.

FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino has said he'll leave the agency in January after holding the position for less than ten months. 

Bongino, a former right-wing podcaster, was appointed by Trump in March amid criticism of his lack of experience. 

You can read more about Bongino's departure from the FBI here.

Trump has finished speaking. 

We'll bring you analysis of what he said during the live televised address shortly.

Trump has promised what he called a ""warrior dividend"" of $1,776 (around €1,500) for military service personnel as a Christmas bonus.

He said the checks have already been sent to the around 1.5 million service personnel. 

The expenditure, paid for by revenues raised by tariffs, would total roughly $2.6 billion.

Trump is traditionally enjoys support from military personnel. Ahead of the 2024 presidential election, somethree-fifths (or 61%) of those who served in the military or military reserves said they supported Trump.

Trump spent the beginning of his speech bashing former President Joe Biden and boasting of his what he sees as his achievements during his first year in office.

He said he had ""inherited a mess"" and ""the worst border in the world"" from the Biden administration.

""We have brought more positive change to Washington than any administration in American history,"" he said.

He briefly touched on many topics during his speech, including crime, immigration, the war on drugs and restoring strength in America's military.

He is also talking about bringing prices down, a topic of concern for many Americans amid an affordability crisis.

He is also praising his adminstration's record on wage increases and employment.

""We are the hottest country anywhere in the world,"" he said.

US President Donald Trump's speech comes amid his falling popularity and concerns over rising costs.

His approval rating decreased from 41% to 39% in a new Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Tuesday.

Just one-third (33%) of Americans approve of how he is handing the economy, the poll found.

A November survey by US broadcaster CBS News and YouGov showed that nearly two-thirds (or 65%) of Americans felt Trump's policies were making the cost of groceries go up. 

US President Donald Trump previewed his speech to reporters on Wednesday, saying, ""The message this evening is we inherited a mess, and we've done a great job, and we continue to, and our country is going to be stonger than ever before very soon.""

White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Trump may tease policy moves that are likely to come next year, too.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Venezuela blockade: What it means for Maduro and oil markets","https://www.dw.com/en/venezuela-blockade-what-it-would-mean-for-the-maduro-regime-and-oil-markets/a-75201861","Thu, 18 Dec 2025 06:37:49 GMT","

US President Donald Trump has threatened Venezuela with a naval blockade to thwart its oil exports — a move that would hit the Maduro government hard but may leave global oil markets unfazed.

Donald Trump's announcement of a ""total and complete blockade"" of sanctioned oil tankers travelling to and from Venezuela has raised questions about the economic consequences for the regime of leftist president Nicolas Maduro.

Trump has made oil a central target in his ongoing campaign against Maduro, which was sparked by the US president's claims that Maduro was to blame for the illegal flow of both migrants and drugs to the US from Venezuela.

The fragile Venezuelan economy is exceptionally dependent on oil. If Trump's blockade threat turns out to be more than just words, it would have significant implications for Caracas.

In a Truth Social post on Tuesday (Dec. 16), Trump said Venezuela ""is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America"" before saying he was ordering the blockade.

Since late August, the US has been setting up a major naval build-up across the Caribbean Sea — one of the largest US naval deployments in the region since the so-called Cuban missile crisis in 1962.

Up to a dozen US military vessels have been operating in the Caribbean in recent weeks, including aircraft carriers, guided-missile destroyers and amphibious assault ships.

A naval blockade is a military operation where warships encircle a specific coastline with a view to prevent maritime traffic from entering or leaving.

Trump's threat specifies ""all sanctioned oil tankers going into, and out of, Venezuela.""

Last week, US forces seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela. US Attorney General Pam Bondi said the tanker had been transporting sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran. Caracas decried the seizure as an act of ""international piracy.""

If successfully and fully implemented, the naval blockade threatened by Trump would dramatically reduce the amount of oil coming out of Venezuela. However, it is not yet clear exactly which tankers would be affected or precisely how a blockade would be carried out.

As is often the case with Trump's social media pledges, there are also legal doubts. Elena Chachko, an international law scholar from UC Berkeley Law School in the US, told news agency Reuters that a blockade would raise ""serious questions on both the domestic law front and international law front.""

While Venezuela's state oil company, PDVSA, is heavily sanctioned and many vessels which pick up oil there are specifically sanctioned, others which transport oil from the country are not. US oil giant Chevron, for example, was given special licences by the Biden administration in 2022 to resume Venezuelan oil exports. The idea at the time was that softening Venezuelan sanctions would ease wider oil market pressures in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

But in October this year, the Trump administration gave Chevron fresh authorization to produce oil in Venezuela argueing the US company was a vital partner for Caracas.

Venezuela is almost completely dependent on oil for state income. Crude oil and related products such as petrochemicals account for more than 90% of Venezuela's export revenues. They keep Maduro's heavily sanctioned and isolated government functioning and in power.

Experts say that if there were more cargo seizures, or if Trump were to follow through on the blockade, much of Venezuela's oil would remain in the country, while that which makes its way out would likely be sold at a steep discount.

There is already evidence that the recent seizure of a Venezuelan tanker by US forces and the threat of further measures is having an impact.

According to data analytics firm S&P Global Commodities Insights, the number of oil tankers travelling to Venezuela has fallen sharply over the past few weeks. The London, UK-based firm said in a report on Tuesday that as of the week starting December 14, there were 17 tankers sailing to or around Venezuelan waters. That's down from 24 vessels a month earlier.

The S&P report also noted that several sanctioned vessels currently ""appear to be turning away"" from Venezuelan waters and the broader Caribbean Sea following the US seizure of the tanker and subsequent sanction announcements.

On December 11, the US sanctioned six shipping companies and six tankers which operated regularly in Venezuela's oil sector, with more sanctions likely in the coming weeks.

Given the level of crisis the Venezuelan economy has endured over the past decade, few can predict what fresh depths it could reach without impacting Maduro's grip on power. 

The country's oil output has already been in decline in recent years as a result of sanctions, corruption and economic mismanagement. Venezuela has the world's largest deposit of known oil reserves but has increasingly struggled to maximize revenues from it.

During the rule of Maduro's predecessor, late Hugo Chavez, oil prices and revenues soared but they have fallen dramatically for more than a decade. Whereas Caracas once pulled in more than $100 billion (€85.6 billion) a year from oil, the figure is now closer to $20 billion.

According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Venezuela's economy endured ""the single largest economic collapse for a non-conflict country in almost half a century,"" in the period since Maduro took office in April 2013.

Although oil prices jumped by more than 1% on Wednesday, most analysts say Trump's blockade threat on Venezuelan output has a limited impact on global markets.

""Overall, export volumes from Venezuela are relatively small in the global supply share. With all eyes on the Russia-Ukraine discussions, the market is still under downside risk,"" one oil trader told Reuters.

Muyu Xu, senior oil analyst at Brussles-based data analytics firm Kpler, told Reuters that while Venezuelan oil production accounts for around 1% of global production, ""most of it is concentrated on a small pool of Chinese buyers, and others in the US and Cuba.""

There are already expectations that the global oil market will face oversupply next year.

Saad Rahim, chief economist of commodity-trading giant, Trafigura, told the Financial Times earlier this month that the oil market will face a ""super glut"" as a burst of new supply collides with weakness in the global economy, and weighing on already falling prices for crude oil in 2026.

The footage was grainy but unmistakable: US marines fast-roping from a black hawk helicopter onto the deck of an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela.

Seizing the vessel, one of Caracas' sanctioned “ghost ships” illegally shipping crude oil, was the prelude to the second act of Donald Trump's campaign to topple Nicolas Maduro.

Within days, the US president announced a full naval blockade designed to sever the Venezuelan president's economic lifeline and compel his loyal inner circle to oust him.

“Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the history of South America. It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before,” Mr Trump declared on Tuesday.

Insiders see the move as a creative new calculus aimed at starving Mr Maduro's government, whose survival depends on selling crude oil abroad, while simultaneously forcing his allies in Moscow and Beijing to abandon him.

“The White House is committed to the effort against the regime and seeing Maduro ousted,” a source close to the administration said.

This is the plan behind Mr Trump's unprecedented blockade and the campaign the White House hopes rids Venezuela of its global influence.

Perched in his presidential office in Miraflores Palace, Mr Maduro has relied on the export of Venezuela's vast oil reserves to prop up his country.

Beneath him lies more crude oil than Saudi Arabia, Russia or the United States and the mineral, dubbed “liquid gold”, accounts for about 88 per cent of Venezuela's $24bn in exports.

Since 2019, Mr Trump has sought to stop that.

In his first term, the US Treasury sanctioned Venezuela's state oil company, PDVSA, and threatened secondary sanctions on any entity doing business with it.

To get around this, Mr Maduro's government has turned to a clandestine “dark fleet” of tankers to evade sanctions and keep oil flowing to buyers in China, Russia and Cuba.

Hundreds of ageing tankers now smuggle sanctioned oil, acting as a financial lifeline to Caracas. As of late November, more than 30 of the 80 ships in Venezuelan waters or approaching the country were under US sanctions.

It is a growing phenomenon. Financial intelligence firm S&P Global estimates that one in five oil tankers worldwide are used to smuggle oil from sanctioned countries.

The tactic appears to be working. Despite international pressure, oil exports rose to some 921,000 barrels per day in November, the third-highest monthly average so far this year.

By seizing the vessels, the Trump administration is attempting to sever Mr Maduro's main source of revenue that keeps his regime afloat while tightening the economic noose.

“What they're doing is essentially trying to cut off any remaining source of revenue for the government, to try to rattle the government into changing the regime,” said Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House.

By choking oil revenue, the White House aims to isolate Mr Maduro's government to the point where he is forced to resign or to spark an uprising from his disgruntled allies.

Indeed, oil tanker seizures are viewed by experts as the final act in Mr Trump's chapter of maximum pressure that began with sanctions years before.

“The revenue that is coming in from oil is something that the regime has long since used as a tool to buy influence within the military and maintain what little the government still is able to produce in the form of oil,” Andrés Martínez-Fernández, senior policy analyst for Latin America at the Allison Centre for National Security, explained.

“It's very quickly going to create instability to a new level within Venezuela and the regime.”

Relations between Washington and Caracas are at a nadir. The US and many of its allies consider Mr Maduro, who is currently serving his disputed third term, as a dictator.

Yet thanks to the export of Venezuela's oil, Mr Maduro has formed a network of loyal military commanders and international allies who keep his reign afloat.

None have become more important than China, which is the biggest buyer of Venezuelan oil, taking roughly 80 per cent of its exports. Every day it imports around 746,000 barrels of oil.

Beijing has taken the oil not as a commercial import but as debt repayment towards an estimated $60bn in loans it has poured into Venezuelan oil projects.

The repayment deal suited both sides. Beijing secured oil while Maduro gained time and a friend on the international stage.

The blockade now threatens to derail the relationship and turn China against Mr Maduro as the ghost fleet of tankers stop arriving in Beijing's ports.

If Venezuelan oil can no longer be delivered reliably, then Mr Maduro ceases to be an asset to China and becomes a legal liability as it chases repayment.

“Once shipments stop arriving at foreign ports, the debts start getting called in. And that's going to have an immediate impact. Things are going to start breaking down quickly, physical infrastructure, if these payments don't start to come in,” Mr Martínez-Fernández explained.

“It could get to a point where China says, ‘we would be better off being rid of this headache and being rid of Maduro, then by continuing any kind of active support.”

Beijing has shown little sympathy to similar situations in the past. In Africa and Central Asia, the state has repeatedly distanced itself from leaders it no longer sees as reliable partners.

For Mr Trump, the blockade is another step in his plan dubbed the “Donroe Doctrine” by insiders, which aims to rid America's backyard of Chinese influence.

Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation doctrine long believed to be a blueprint for his second term, calls it “re-hemisphering”. It calls for the capture of supply chains in the region as a requirement of US economic security.

In that sense, the blockade is not aimed at confronting China head on but at making Mr Maduro persona non grata. If the oil-for-debt deal collapses, Beijing may consider switching horses and abandoning him.

Also in the crosshairs is Havana, which has long relied on subsidised Venezuelan oil.

Cuba, which has been the subject of its own US blockade, has been receiving some 24,000 barrels of crude, gasoline and jet fuel per day from the regime.

Mr Sabatini said the blockade will be “catastrophic” for Cuba, a historic enemy of the US, and estimates that exports will drop dramatically.

“This is the moment that people like Marco Rubio [the secretary of state] and Cuban-American hardliners living in Florida have been waiting for,” he said.

“They're trying to starve the government. By doing that, then they actually starve the people too.”

While China has poured millions into Venezuelan oil projects, Russia has been a key enabler in the shadows.

A Russian-linked “dark fleet” of tankers have also helped Mr Maduro avoid sanctions by shipping his oil around the globe. However, Putin, who has sought to curry favour with Mr Trump since his return to the Oval Office, may redirect the vessels, further isolating Mr Maduro.

Indeed, signs of Moscow's shift in position are already there. Reports from late November suggested that Russia had initiated the evacuation of its citizens from the region.

Experts agree that Mr Trump is attempting to squeeze Mr Maduro economically while testing the resolve of his few remaining allies in the hope they turn against him.

“It does seem to be another way for the administration to ratchet up the pressure against the Maduro government,” said Brian Finucane, a former state department lawyer who is now senior adviser at the International Crisis Group.

The formation of the armada, the largest US military presence in the region in decades, began with a series of strikes on boats the Trump administration claimed were ferrying illegal narcotics to the US.

For months, American forces have launched lethal strikes on small vessels skimming through international waters under the banner of anti-drug operations.

US navy and coastguard units have destroyed around 20 boats since early September, killing over 90 people.

Eight warships, including three destroyers, three amphibious assault ships, a cruiser and a smaller littoral combat ship now make up the largest US military presence in the region in decades.

They are joined by a squadron of F-35B Lightning II jets and a handful of Reaper drones, which are capable of flying long distances and carrying up to eight laser-guided missiles. B-2 bombers have also been spotted flying off the coast.

It has led many Venezuelans, and many Americans, to believe that Mr Trump is preparing for war.

The blockade, insiders suggest, is one of the lesser military escalations the president had been weighing with his cabinet in recent weeks.

Instead, they hope to turn the very cartels that military officials say are complicit in the smuggling of fentanyl to the US, against their leader by choking their cash flow, which is used to finance them.

For the armed forces, oil revenue is the glue that keeps the system intact. Generals control ports, customs and fuel distribution, making the military a pillar of Mr Maduro's power.

As long as Mr Maduro can afford to pay his generals, their unfettered loyalty and in turn, his regime, will continue.

The same logic applies to Mr Maduro's alleged relationship with organised crime. These groups rely on access to ports and laundering routes, all of which are sustained by the cash generated by oil sales.

“It doesn't take us yet to the place where we're going into Venezuelan territory and conducting military strikes. We're still talking about operations in international waters,” Mr Martínez-Fernández said.

The formation of the armada, coupled with Mr Trump's continued threat of land strikes, have led experts to believe that the blockade is part of a slide towards conflict.

Top military officials are said to have presented the US president with options for military intervention in the region which include land strikes. Other options reported to have been drawn up by the Pentagon include direct attacks on Mr Maduro's security detail or operations to seize the country's oil fields.

Recommended

In each, Mr Trump is said to be against ideas that may place American troops at risk or could turn into an embarrassing failure.

Mr Trump and his cabinet have begun framing the blockade as a necessary intervention to reclaim “American oil”.

So what is stopping him? Perhaps his thirst for the Nobel Peace Prize and the potential blowback amongst his America First base if he started a war.

What happens next will be determined by Mr Trump's blockade. If oil flow continues, Mr Maduro survives.

But if it is stopped, China may decide the debt is not worth collecting and his cash-poor lieutenants may turn against him.

The gamble in Washington is simple; regimes do not fall when they are attacked but when they are abandoned.

			The president's angry address from the White House signalled he fears turning into his worst nightmare: Joe Biden

The price of eggs has fallen by 80pc, apparently. There are states where gas is now below $2 a gallon. And 100pc of jobs are now going to American-born workers. In a typically punchy end-of-year address from the White House on Wednesday evening, President Trump came out fighting. The fact-checkers will no doubt be hard at work, trying to validate each extravagant claim. But the bigger point was surely this. The President is clearly rattled by the way his polling numbers on the economy are in freefall – and he has yet to work out how he should respond to that.

When he won last November's election, there was one issue, above all, that delivered his victory. The Democrats had suffered a historic loss of faith in their handling of the economy. “Eleven months ago I inherited a mess, with the worst inflation in history,” President Trump opened his address. And over the next 30 minutes, he attempted to convince his prime-time audience that everything was getting far better.

The trouble is, the voters are not convinced. In the latest polls, only 36pc of Americans approve of his handling of the economy, while 45pc of voters cite rising prices as their top concern. Trump's overall approval rating has dropped to 39pc. Unlike his first term, when average voters generally liked his economic record, he is now facing a backlash. Populist Democrats such as the newly elected New York mayor Zohran Mamdani are exploiting “affordability” as a winning issue for the Left. Trump can surely sense his vulnerability. Ironically, he is turning into Joe Biden, a president undermined by rising prices.

It is hard to believe that Trump's often bizarre, rambling address will have changed people's minds. To start with, he is partly to blame for rising prices. Tariffs may or may not be the right way to rebuild American manufacturing, secure supply chains, and raise revenue to balance the books. We can all argue about that. But they clearly put up the prices of many imported goods, at least in the short term. 

Likewise, restricting immigration may well improve wages over the medium term, but there is no point in denying that for the first year it is likely to make many services more expensive as cheap labour gets deported.

Next, it takes more than a year to turn the economy around. Lighter regulation of energy companies, for example, will take several years to feed through into noticeably lower electricity bills for the average household. Addressing the absurdly high prices of medicines in the US, and getting other countries to pay more, won't reduce insurance premiums right away. Incentivising multi-nationals into building factories in the US instead of Ireland or Vietnam will take time to create better paid jobs. By claiming all those policies were already making everyone better off, the President is stretching credibility. It would be far better to simply say ‘I've made a start, and if we stick with the course we will see the results in a year or two”.

President Trump has a perfectly good story to tell the American public at the end of his first year. He has radically overhauled trade policy; he has curbed at least some wasteful spending; he has tightened up immigration; and he has started to cut taxes. If he had patiently explained why he had made those decisions, and asked for more time for those policies to bear fruit, it would have been a lot more convincing. Instead, an angry address that claimed he had already transformed living standards simply made him look worried – and that is hardly a comfortable place to end the year.

This follows two failed Senate attempts to stop Trump from continuing military action without congressional approval.

House Republicans on Wednesday defeated a pair of war powers resolutions aimed at reining in US President Donald Trump's airstrikes on alleged drug-running boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean and his increasingly aggressive provocations that critics fear are leading to a war on Venezuela.

The first resolution, introduced by Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY), demanded that the US refrain from armed hostilities “with any presidentially designated terrorist organization in the Western Hemisphere, unless authorized by a declaration of war or a specific congressional authorization for use of military force.”

Trump dubiously designated drug cartels — including the Venezuela-based group Tren de Aragua — as foreign terrorist organizations in an executive order signed on his first day back in the White House.

The resolution was defeated 210-216, with seven lawmakers not voting. Two Republicans — Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Thomas Massie of Kentucky — voted in favor of the measure. Democratic Texas Reps. Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez joined their GOP colleagues in voting down the proposal.

The second resolution, introduced by Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), would have directed Trump to “remove the use of United States armed forces from hostilities within or against Venezuela, unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific statutory authorization for use of military force.”

The resolution failed by a vote of 211-213, with nine members not voting. Republicans Bacon, Massie, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia voted “yes” on the legislation, while Cuellar voted against the proposal.

“The Trump administration's ongoing lethal US military strikes on alleged drug boats in the Western Hemisphere are legally questionable, and ineffective,” Meeks and Reps. Adam Smith (D-Wash.), Jim Himes (D-Conn.), Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), Jason Crow (D-Colo.), and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) — all members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee — said in a statement following the vote.

“Under existing US law, these vessels could have been interdicted and their occupants subjected to judicial process,” the lawmakers noted. “Instead of pursuing prosecutions, this administration has deliberately avoided judicial scrutiny by conducting lethal strikes, repatriating survivors, and in at least one instance, carrying out a second strike on defenseless persons.”

The Democrats continued:

The president has failed to demonstrate the necessary authority under US or international law to conduct lethal military strikes on these boats. No one can credibly claim that these vessels, in some cases not even traveling to the United States and located thousands of miles from US soil, posed an imminent threat to the American people warranting the use of military force. Our war powers resolution sought to terminate these extrajudicial strikes, yet most Republicans chose loyalty to Donald Trump over their oath to the Constitution. By not reining in Trump's gross abuse of power, they are sending a dangerous signal that any president can unilaterally commit US armed forces to hostilities without congressional authorization. We hope our Republican colleagues find their courage in the face of President Trump's threats to expand this military operation into Venezuela. Should he be allowed to do so, he will no doubt provoke another forever war that the American people do not support and Congress has certainly not authorized.

The House votes follow two failed Senate attempts to stop Trump from continuing military action against alleged drug cartels without congressional approval. A vote on a war powers resolution introduced earlier this month by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) is expected this week. Meanwhile, Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) on Monday announced a separate resolution to stop US forces from launching more boat strikes.

Wednesday's votes came after Trump escalated US aggression toward Venezuela by ordering a “total and complete blockade” on “all sanctioned oil tankers” approaching and leaving the South American country. In a social media post divorced from historical fact, Trump accused Venezuela of stealing “oil, land, and other assets” from the United States.

This, after Trump's deployment of an armada of warships and thousands of troops to the southern Caribbean, his authorization of CIA covert action against the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, and his threats of a land invasion of Venezuela. Most of the at least 95 people killed in the more than two dozen US strikes on boats allegedly transporting drugs have also been Venezuelans.

Undeterred by Wednesday's votes, members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) vowed to “continue to fight to stop Trump's illegal war on Venezuela.”

“Tonight's razor-thin, 211-to-213 vote on the bipartisan war powers resolution to end these illegal hostilities puts Trump on notice,” Omar, the deputy CPC chair, said in a statement.

Omar continued:

Nearly a quarter-century ago, the American people were misled by a lawless president promoting lies about weapons of mass destruction, all to invade an oil-rich country that posed no threat to us. The result was a disaster that killed thousands of American service members, triggered a humanitarian crisis in Iraq, and destabilized the entire region. Trump is pursuing the same course today in Venezuela, absurdly designating fentanyl a WMD while blockading Venezuela until the country gives him “all of the Oil, Land, and other Assets.”

“Trump has no mandate to push his unconstitutional military campaign against Venezuela,” Omar added. “If Trump continues to carry out oil tanker seizures, impose a naval blockade, and put American service members in harm's way for an illegal regime change war, he can surely expect a vote to immediately stop this disastrous conflict.”

As immigrants in southeastern Louisiana and Mississippi braced for this month's U.S. Homeland Security operation, Cristiane Rosales-Fajardo received a panicked phone call from a friend.

The friend's Guatemalan tenant, who didn't know she was pregnant, had just delivered a premature baby in the New Orleans house. The parents lacked legal residency, and the mother refused to go to a hospital for fear of being detained by federal immigration officers.

“There's blood everywhere, and the baby's dead,” Rosales-Fajardo recalled her friend saying.

Rosales-Fajardo put on her sandals, grabbed surgical gloves, and rushed to the house.

Rosales-Fajardo, herself an immigrant from Brazil, is a grassroots organizer and advocate in the New Orleans East community, where many immigrants live. She has no formal medical training, but she has experience with delivering babies.

She scanned the room when she arrived. A 3-year-old child stood to one side while the mother sat on the edge of the bed. The father held their swaddled newborn son, who wasn't breathing and was wrapped in blood-soaked towels.

“The baby was completely gray,” Rosales-Fajardo later said.

Rosales-Fajardo wiped fluid away from his small mouth and rubbed his back before performing tiny chest compressions and breathing air into his lungs.

She told the parents she had to call 911 to get the mother and newborn to a hospital for care. The baby was out, but the delivery wasn't over.

“I assured her. I promised her that she was going to be safe,” Rosales-Fajardo said.

Fear hung over the room. Still, she made the call and continued performing CPR. Finally, the newborn revived and squirmed in Rosales-Fajardo's arms. When the ambulance arrived, the mother tried to keep her husband from riding with her, terrified they would both be arrested. He went, anyway.

“These are hard-working people,” Rosales-Fajardo said. “All they do is work to provide for their family. But they were almost at risk of losing their child rather than call 911.”

Nearly two weeks into the Department of Homeland Security's Operation Catahoula Crunch, which launched Dec. 3, health professionals and community advocates in Louisiana and Mississippi report that a significantly higher-than-usual number of immigrant patients have skipped health care appointments and experienced heightened stress levels.

According to a press release, DHS said it had arrested more than 250 people as of Dec. 11. Though federal officials say they're targeting criminals, The Associated Press reported that most of the 38 people arrested in the first two days of the New Orleans operation had no criminal record.

Since President Donald Trump took office in January, immigrant families nationwide have become more likely to skip or delay health care, due in part to concerns about their legal status, according to a recent survey by KFF and The New York Times.

The survey found that nearly 8 in 10 immigrants likely to be living in the U.S. without legal permission say they've experienced negative health impacts this year, from increased anxiety to sleeping problems to worsened health conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes. The federal immigration raids in California, Illinois, North Carolina, and now Louisiana and Mississippi add to the health care barriers that these families already face, including access to services, language barriers, lack of insurance, and high costs.

That hesitancy to receive even emergency care appears justified amid the ongoing raids. Hospitals and health facilities generally must allow federal agents in areas where the public is allowed, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. In California this year, federal agents have staked out hospital lobbies, shown up at community clinics, and guarded detainees in hospital rooms. Even driving to and from appointments poses a risk, as traffic stops are a popular place for immigration agents to make arrests.

University Medical Center nurse Terry Mogilles said that immigrants typically make up at least half the patients in her orthopedic trauma clinic in New Orleans, many of them with construction-related, bone-crushing injuries that require surgery. But now, Mogilles said, many of those patients aren't coming in for follow-up appointments, despite the risk of infection.

“When we call, we can't get through,” Mogilles said. “It is so upsetting because we have no idea what's happening to them post-op.”

Federal officials said the Catahoula Crunch operation extends to southern Mississippi, though the bulk of the initial arrests have occurred in the Greater New Orleans area. Immigrant families throughout Mississippi are hunkering down in anticipation.

Michael Oropeza, the executive director of El Pueblo, a nonprofit serving low-income immigrant communities in Biloxi and Forest, said the organization has witnessed families delay care, cancel children's checkups, and go without refilling medication.

“It's not because they don't value their health; it's because they don't feel safe,” Oropeza said. “When hospitals and clinics are no longer that safe place, people withdraw trust that took years to build up. It can disappear overnight.”

Maria, a Biloxi resident from Honduras, said, in Spanish, she and her two children have missed routine doctors' appointments because they are “terrified” to leave the house amid an increased presence of federal immigration officers. Her husband, who is authorized to work in the U.S., was detained for two months this year.

Her children are U.S. citizens. They previously qualified for Medicaid, but Maria opted to disenroll them three years ago out of concern that using public benefits would jeopardize her family's residency applications, she said. The family now pays for their children's care out-of-pocket.

When it feels safe to attend doctors' appointments again, Maria said, her priority will be seeking mental health care to address the stress her family has endured.

“I definitely need to see a doctor to get checked out, because I don't feel well,” she said, describing her anxiety, depression, and insomnia.

In Louisiana, Marcela Hernandez of Familias Unidas en Acción, a nonprofit that provides direct aid to immigrants, said many of the families she works with live paycheck to paycheck. Sheltering at home and missing work only adds to the stress. Hernandez said she received 800 calls for food in two days from families afraid to leave home.

The federal operation in Louisiana and Mississippi could last more than two months, according to the AP. The longer it goes on, Hernandez said, the more she worries evictions will come next as people can't pay rent, further traumatizing a community whose members often had to make difficult and dangerous journeys to flee hardships in their countries of origin to reach the U.S.

“You don't leave your country knowing that you're gonna get raped on the way just simply because you wanna come and meet Mickey Mouse,” she said.

Rosales-Fajardo, who runs a nonprofit called El Pueblo NOLA, said families tell her how children have started urinating on themselves due to stress and fear. Nationally, immigrants who are likely to lack legal status report that some of their children have had problems sleeping and that they've seen changes in school performance or behavior, according to the KFF and New York Times survey.

Community groups said they hope people step up locally to deliver food and hygiene products to immigrant homes, and that health care professionals provide more at-home or telehealth visits.

Like at other hospitals, UMC's waiting rooms are considered public spaces, Mogilles noted. But the nurses union is calling for the hospital to create safe spaces for patients that federal agents can't access and clearer policies to protect health care workers who shield patients. Post-op appointments can't be done virtually, so patients need to feel safe enough to come in, Mogilles said.

Prenatal and postnatal care is also challenging to provide virtually, leaving the health of new and expecting mothers vulnerable, said Latona Giwa, the executive director of Repro TLC, a national sexual and reproductive health training nonprofit.

Since the Chicago immigration sweeps began in September, Giwa said, the clinics and health providers her organization works with have reported that 30% of patients had missed appointments. She said pharmacies saw a 40% drop in medication pickups.

“What we know about management of chronic conditions, especially in pregnancy, but in general, is that even missing one appointment can impact the trajectory of that condition and worsen a patient's outcomes,” Giwa said.

In Louisiana, which already has poor maternal health outcomes, the fear of arrest could exacerbate the crisis worsened by the overturning of Roe v. Wade and threaten lives. She's especially concerned about families with preterm babies in the neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU.

“Imagine your child is in the hospital, and so vulnerable, and you are terrified to go visit and care for your newborn infant because you're worried about being deported,” Giwa said, noting that a newborn's health partly relies on parental visits.

That's the position the Guatemalan family in New Orleans is navigating.

On a recent day in December, Rosales-Fajardo acted as the family's translator and advocate on their first visit to see their son in the NICU at a hospital on Lake Pontchartrain's Northshore. Hospital staffers told the parents they would need to make the long and risky trip to the hospital repeatedly for at least a month to provide skin-to-skin contact and breast milk.

Rosales-Fajardo drove the parents, who were afraid to travel alone out of fear of being pulled over and arrested on a bridge. She said she'll keep driving them as long as she needs to.

“Whenever they see a Hispanic driving or anything like that, that's suspicious to them,” she said of federal agents.

But the baby is safe and healthy. And the parents have named Rosales-Fajardo his godmother.

 How the Houthis—and a New Civil War in Yemen—Could Upend the Post-Gaza Balance of Power

 April Longley Alley

Among the broader regional effects of the October cease-fire in Gaza, one of the more significant was supposed to be a new calm in the Red Sea and potentially in Yemen. Indeed, as a result of the truce, the Houthis—the heavily armed militant group that controls northern Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa, and is allied with Hamas and Iran—paused their attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea and against Israel. An earlier Omani-brokered agreement between the Houthis and the U.S. government also seemed to wind down the direct Houthi threat to U.S. assets in the shipping corridor. Within Yemen, a fragile three-and-a-half-year-old truce in the civil war between the Houthis and the internationally recognized government was still in place. Although the Houthis were not defeated, U.S. officials seemed to believe that the situation in the country had quieted and that they could turn their attention elsewhere.

Less than two months later, that relative calm is fading. In early December, southern Yemeni separatists launched a major campaign to seize large parts of the Hadramawt, an oil-producing region bordering Saudi Arabia, and Mahra, a province bordering Oman. The offensive by the Southern Transitional Council, a group that is part of the internationally recognized Yemeni government but advocates independence for southern Yemen, marks a seismic shift in the country's balance of power. For one thing, the STC is backed by the United Arab Emirates, and its bold expansion has set off new tensions with Saudi Arabia, which supports competing factions within the government and views the takeover as a potential threat to its national security. Still more concerning, the STC offensive is likely to provide a pretext for larger actions by the Houthis.

Even as the STC campaign has unfolded, the Houthis have vowed to extend their own control over the oil- and gas-producing regions in the country's east. With the help of Iran and other countries, the Houthis have also worked tirelessly to expand their arsenal of advanced conventional weapons; they have also scaled up domestic weapons production, with the capacity to assemble ballistic missiles as well as to independently manufacture short-range drones. Moreover, the group's actions and rhetoric continue to underscore its desire to control all of Yemen and to continue to confront Israel, the United States, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. If the Gaza cease-fire falters, the Houthis are ready to continue their Red Sea attacks, and now that they have seen how effective that campaign has been, they could restart it for other reasons in the future.

The United States ignores Yemen at its peril. Thus far, the Trump administration has limited itself to imposing sanctions on the Houthis, protecting the U.S. bilateral truce with the group, and hoping that Israel and U.S. partners in the Gulf will sort out any other issues on their own. The administration has also largely stepped away from supporting the government of Yemen and providing diplomatic leadership to end the civil war. 

But without a broader U.S. strategy, financial pressure on the Houthis may well backfire. Before the STC's move in December, the Houthi leadership suggested it might seek to seize more territory or extort financial concessions from Saudi Arabia to gain more resources. Now the upheaval in the south has made the country more combustible, threatening to reignite a conflict that has until now played to the Houthis' advantage. Any return to full-blown war would have reverberations across the Gulf and the Red Sea region.

As the dust settles from Israel's war in Gaza, the Houthis are notable outliers. With Hamas decimated, Lebanon's Hezbollah largely decapitated, the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria toppled, and Shiite militias in Iraq avoiding conflict with Israel, the other members of Iran's once powerful axis of resistance are severely weakened. By contrast, the Houthis have been emboldened by the war in Gaza, which helped enable their leaders to harden the group's ideological core, marginalize pragmatists, and reinforce their supporters' belief that they are on a holy mission to liberate Palestine and upend a U.S.- and Israeli-dominated regional order.

The Houthis have derived tangible rewards from their defiance. By staying on a war footing, they have avoided accountability for rising poverty and for failing to pay public sector salaries in areas they control. They have also used the conflict to crack down on perceived enemies, narrow any room for dissent, and tighten their grip on power. Meanwhile, the group's high-profile conflict with Israel has bolstered military recruitment, including of child soldiers, and facilitated its efforts to train and indoctrinate a new generation. As of 2024, the Houthis were estimated to have some 350,000 fighters.

The Houthi threat has been compounded by the group's growing military capabilities. In the early phases of the war in Gaza, Houthi missiles were mostly unable to reach Israeli territory; by May 2025, they could hit Ben Gurion Airport outside Tel Aviv. In September 2025, Houthi drones were also able to evade Israeli air defenses, wounding more than 20 people in Eilat and hitting nearby Ramon Airport. Houthi missiles have also struck Yanbu, a major Saudi oil port some 620 miles from the Yemeni border. At the same time, the Gaza conflict has given the Houthis valuable operational experience, allowing them to improve the accuracy of their targeting and test new weapons, including ballistic missiles armed with cluster munitions.



To expand its arsenal, the group has diversified its supply chains and forged ties with a variety of U.S. foes, including China and Russia alongside Iran. For years, Tehran has supplied conventional weapons and training to the Houthis, and it has doubled down on this support as other parts of its vaunted regional axis have weakened. Yet the Houthis are now also importing dual-use components and military-grade material from China for use in domestic weapons manufacturing. In September, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned 32 Houthi-linked individuals and entities, including several based in China, for illicit fundraising, smuggling, and weapons procurement.

In turn, Russia has shared targeting data through Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to help the Houthis hit Western ships, according to the Wall Street Journal. Moscow has also delivered oil to the Houthis through the Yemeni port of Hodeidah. And in Somalia, the Houthis have provided weapons and training to the Sunni jihadist group al-Shabab in return for cash and a potential partnership in disrupting shipping in the Gulf of Aden. Somalia has also become an important transit hub for weapons smuggled into Houthi areas.

The Houthis' leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, has made it clear that the group's ambitions do not stop at Yemen's borders. In fact, uniting the Islamic world against Western influence and Israel has been part of the Houthis' core belief system since the group's inception in the early 2000s—a mission that has been greatly amplified by the war in Gaza. Houthi has said that more rounds of fighting with Israel are “inevitable” and that Saudi Arabia and the UAE are puppets in the U.S.-Israeli regional project and traitors to the Palestinian cause. He now boasts that his movement is training more than a million mujahideen and that Houthi-dominated Yemen leads the Arab world in military production and manufacturing. Although the claims regarding weapons production are patently false, they serve to buttress the Houthis' self-image as the leading Arab resistance force.

As their profile has grown, the Houthis have taken some hits. Operation Rough Rider, an intense 52-day bombing campaign that the Trump administration began in March, destroyed many Houthi arms depots and manufacturing facilities, although the full extent of the damage remains unclear. And the U.S. decision this year to redesignate the group as a foreign terrorist organization has put economic strain on Houthi-controlled territories by cutting off their access to the international banking system.

Since the summer of 2024, Israeli bombardments have inflicted significant damage on Houthi-controlled areas, shutting down the north's only international airport, destroying much of the port of Hodeidah, and wreaking havoc on Yemen's electrical infrastructure. Israel has also targeted the Houthis' leadership with some success. In August, an Israeli strike killed the prime minister and other members of the Houthi-controlled government in Sanaa, none of whom were core Houthi ideologues In October, the Houthis confirmed that their chief of staff, a key military strategist, had also been assassinated. Although these attacks have had limited success in reaching the group's top leaders, they have forced them underground, slowed Houthi communications, and stoked rumors that others may also have perished.



But Washington's overall approach to Yemen is riddled with contradictions. For example, the administration's bilateral truce with the Houthis in May offered a quick exit from Operation Rough Rider, which had already cost more than $1 billion and involved heavy military assets that were needed elsewhere. But it did not prevent the Houthis from continuing attacks on non-U.S. targets in the Red Sea or from flinging more missiles and drones at Israel. Nor did it provide a long-term strategy for protecting American interests in the Red Sea or the Gulf.

On the contrary, by allowing Washington to disengage politically and militarily from Yemen, the truce has given the Houthis an opportunity to escalate its battles against its internal and regional enemies at a lower cost. Compounding the problem, the Trump administration has suspended most humanitarian aid for Yemen, including in areas controlled by the Yemeni government that the United States is ostensibly supporting. In a country in which 24 million people—a significant majority of the population—require humanitarian assistance and more than 14 million are in acute need, this amounts to an enormous blow.

Meanwhile, by toughening sanctions and removing diplomatic off-ramps for the Houthis, the administration has closed any prospect of a negotiated peace deal for now. The United States no longer has a dedicated envoy to Yemen, indicating how far the country has fallen down Washington's list of priorities. The administration does not support returning to the pre–Gaza war formula for a Yemeni settlement, which called for the Houthis to agree to a cease-fire and a political process in exchange for financial benefits including the payment of public sector salaries. Yet few in Washington are working to find an alternative path forward.

With the new upheaval in the south, the United States and its Gulf allies could soon face a broader crisis. It is possible that the UAE and Saudi Arabia could work to limit the shock waves from the STC's seizure of Hadramawt by agreeing on a joint effort to contain tensions within the Yemeni government. Such a deal might lead to a more unified front against the Houthis allowing for a revived exploration of a political settlement in Yemen or a push by these forces to take territory from the Houthis in the north ahead of potential talks. 

Already, the president of the STC, Aidarous al-Zubaidi, announced that the group's “next goal must be Sanaa, peacefully or through war.” Any agreement whereby STC forces could support fighters along the Red Sea coast and the city of Marib to reclaim the north from the Houthis would be tough, likely involving guarantees for southern autonomy and possibly a referendum in the future. But none of this is possible until the immediate impasse in Hadramawt is resolved in a way that addresses Saudi Arabia's security concerns.

Time may be running short. There is also a real possibility of fighting between government factions, which could help the Houthis make further military or political advances. If the STC were to declare independence—something it seems keen to avoid for now because few countries would extend recognition—it could prompt a realignment of northern forces against it.



Even if the STC's campaign does not reignite a larger war, the Houthis will soon need to relieve the economic pressure they are under. This would likely mean seizing more resources inside Yemen—for example, by capturing the oil-rich governorate of Marib east of Sanaa—or by coercing Saudi Arabia into offering new financial concessions. The Houthis have been openly threatening Riyadh, demanding that the kingdom move to definitively end the civil war, lift restrictions on the ports and airports, and pay war reparations for the damage caused by Saudi air strikes on the country between 2015 and 2022. The Houthis' messaging, including the reposting of videos of their previous incursions into Saudi territory and attacks on Aramco oil facilities, underscores their willingness to use force.

Given their focus on domestic priorities and growing doubts about the U.S. security umbrella, the Saudis could well succumb to this pressure. Although a Houthi grab for more territory will face internal Yemeni resistance, Riyadh may hesitate to assist these anti-Houthi forces for fear of renewed attacks. Alternatively, with the Yemeni government's position weakened by the STC's moves in the south, the Houthis could seek territorial gains, for example by redoubling efforts to get government-aligned tribal leaders around Marib to switch allegiance to their side. Any of these paths would give the Houthis more resources to arm themselves for future battles with the United States and its partners, not to mention reducing any chance of an inclusive political settlement in Yemen.

Israeli leaders have vowed to punish the Houthi leadership for its brazen attacks on Israel, and the Israeli government has established a new intelligence unit focused on Yemen. If the Gaza cease-fire collapses, clashes between the Houthis and Israel will resume, which could distract the Houthis from other fronts and provide potential miliary opportunities for their Yemeni adversaries. Yet Washington cannot rely on Israel to handle the Houthi challenge.

The Houthis are far from Israel and firmly entrenched in mountainous terrain similar to Afghanistan's. As Saudi and U.S. campaigns have already shown, the group cannot be defeated by aerial bombardment alone. What is more, Israel is deeply unpopular in Houthi-controlled areas, and further Israeli strikes, especially on civilian infrastructure, risk rallying ordinary Yemenis against a hated external enemy. Even if Israel is able to pull off additional high-level assassinations, it might produce a more hard-line Houthi leadership in Sanaa or a new scramble for power that could destabilize the region in new ways.

Washington's desire to avoid getting entangled in a costly war in Yemen is understandable. Nearly two months of intense U.S. bombing last spring inflicted pain on the Houthis but failed to change their behavior or their hold on power. The new STC offensive highlights growing fractures within the coalition supporting the internationally recognized Yemen government and the dauntingly complex and shifting nature of the country's domestic politics. But given Yemen's strategic location on the Red Sea corridor and its proximity to Washington's key Gulf allies, the Trump administration cannot afford a policy vacuum.

To prevent a broader conflagration, the United States will need to recommit serious attention to the country. Most urgently, the administration must press Saudi Arabia and the UAE to quickly de-escalate tensions in the south and come to a common approach to Yemen. This will be a precondition for effectively addressing the Houthis. At the same time, Washington must do more to help government-aligned Yemeni forces hold critical frontlines, including in Marib and along the Red Sea coast, to persuade the Houthis to compromise. Enhanced U.S. security guarantees to Saudi Arabia and the UAE can play an important role in this regard, providing assurances that if either country is attacked by the Houthis, the United States will assist in their defense.

Washington must also renew its support for a dedicated diplomatic track. Yemen has been at war for more than ten years, and the staggering toll on its population will have generational effects. The Houthis and indeed the country's broader internal challenges cannot be solved through economic pressure or externally led bombing campaigns alone. Coercion is needed—especially on-the-ground political and military pressure from Yemenis—but off-ramps and diplomacy are equally important. To this end, the United States should coordinate with all the major stakeholders in the country—Yemenis, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, the UN, and others—to map out a revised settlement.

The Trump administration needs to recognize that the post-Gaza, Gulf-centric security order it seeks to build in the Middle East will not succeed if Yemen descends into chaos. In the absence of U.S. engagement, Saudi Arabia and the UAE will likely continue to back rival groups within the government coalition, deepening tensions between two key U.S. allies (that are also playing out in Sudan), expanding divisions among Yemenis, and creating opportunities for the Houthis—as well as other violent groups such as al-Qaeda—to take advantage. And that could result in renewed Houthi actions across the region.

Restoring calm to Yemen will not be easy, and the effort will need to include security guarantees for the Red Sea and for Gulf neighbors as well as address the STC's demands for southern independence. It will ultimately require bringing the Houthis into a political process and refocusing their attention domestically by giving them a stake in a better future. A deal may well stall in the face of many competing interests. But doing nothing will be far worse, all but ensuring that Yemen's problems continue to spill out into one of the world's most vital shipping lanes and the greater Middle East. Washington does not need to lead in Yemen, but the stakes are too high not to show up.

 A Conversation With Daron Acemoglu

The world has reached various inflection points, or so we are often told. Advanced technology, such as artificial intelligence, promises to transform our way of life. In geopolitics, the growing competition between China and the United States heralds an uncertain new era. And within many democracies, the old assumptions that undergirded politics are in doubt; liberalism appears to be in disarray and illiberal forces on the rise.

Few scholars are grappling with the many dimensions of the current moment quite like Daron Acemoglu is. “The world is in the throes of a pervasive crisis,” he wrote in Foreign Affairs in 2023, a crisis characterized by widening economic inequalities and a breakdown in public trust. Acemoglu is a Nobel Prize–winning economist, but his research and writing has long strayed beyond the conventional bounds of his discipline. He has written famously, in the best-selling book Why Nations Fail, about how institutions determine the success of countries. He has explored how technological advances have transformed—or indeed failed to transform—societies. And more recently, he has turned his attention to the crisis facing liberal democracy, one accentuated by economic alienation and the threat of technological change.

Deputy Editor Kanishk Tharoor spoke with Acemoglu about a stormy world of overlapping crises and about how the ship of liberal democracy might be steered back on course.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Judge cites ‘barbaric' acts in sentencing Brian Walshe to life in prison without parole for wife's murder","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/18/us/brian-walshe-sentencing","Thu, 18 Dec 2025 13:55:45 GMT","


            A judge in Dedham, Massachusetts, called the acts of Brian Walshe “barbaric and incomprehensible” before sentencing him Thursday to life in prison without parole for killing his wife, dismembering her body and discarding her remains in dumpsters.
    


            The sentencing comes after a jury on Monday convicted Walshe of first-degree murder, finding he planned to kill Ana Walshe, the mother of their three children,  just hours after ringing in the new year in 2023.
    


            “The seriousness of your acts cannot be overstated. Your acts in dismembering your wife's body and disposing of her remains in multiple area dumpsters can only be described as barbaric and incomprehensible,” Judge Diane Freniere said, addressing Walshe directly in court. “You had no regard for the lifelong mental harm that your criminal acts inflicted on your then two-, four- and six-year-old sons.”
    


            The situation has had a “devastating impact on her children,” the judge noted, referencing a sealed letter from the state Department of Children and Families. Ana Walshe's sister also spoke briefly on behalf of her family, telling the judge how Ana's death “left us with an unbearable emptiness.”
    


            The sentence of life without parole for a first-degree murder conviction is required by law. Freniere also ordered Walshe to serve consecutive prison sentences for two other convictions he pleaded guilty to ahead of the trial.
    


            She ordered him to serve the statutory maximum on both of those lesser charges – up to 20 years for the count of misleading police and up to three years for the improper conveyance of a body.
    


            The sentencing represents the culmination of a case that captured national attention almost three years ago, first with the initial search for 39-year-old Ana Walshe, and then with the grisly evidence that her husband googled topics like “how to dispose of a body” and other inquiries on cleaning up blood.
    


            Before the judge imposed Walshe's sentence, defense attorney Kelli Porges said consecutive prison sentences would be inhumane and, despite what's been said in court, “He is a human. He is a father. He is a son, and he has been a friend to many. The life sentence is mandatory, but to do consecutive sentences, I think, is inappropriate and inhumane.”
    


            Brian Walshe did not address the court and showed no visible emotion during the proceeding.
    


            Walshe's mother submitted a letter to the judge on her son's behalf ahead of the sentencing.
    


            “Although I consider the letter of Diana Walshe, I simply cannot reconcile the person Diana Walshe describes in her letter with the person who stands before me for sentence,” Freniere said. “Mr. Walshe, you will live with the guilt and burden of Ana Walshe's death for the rest of your life.”
    


Brian Walshe found guilty of wife's murder



            Prosecutors had asked the judge to sentence Walshe to consecutive sentences. Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Greg Connor said the facts of the case call for a harsh penalty.
    


            “We recognize it's harsh and we think it's appropriate based on the facts,” Connor said.
    


            Brian Walshe, 50, left a trail of evidence prosecutors used to retrace his actions to dispose of his wife's remains.
    


            Prosecutors told the jury Ana met a violent death at her husband's hand before he dismembered her body and disposed of her remains in area dumpsters.
    


            Walshe then lied to investigators, claiming she had gone missing the morning of January 1, 2023, after leaving their Massachusetts home to handle a work emergency in Washington, DC, where she worked as a real estate manager and lived part time.
    


            Ana Walshe's body has never been found.
    


            Prosecutors are working to get a death certificate for her after her husband's conviction.
    


            “He robbed her family and friends of the opportunity to bury her. There is no death certificate,” Connor said. “The church will not allow a funeral to go on. At this point in time, we are working on trying to work with the (medical examiner's) office to see if we can get the death certificate issued now based on the conviction and based on the plea.”
    


            Prosecutors called about 50 witnesses over eight days, but they never offered the jury a theory of how exactly Walshe killed his wife.
    


            Instead, they worked to shed light on purported strife in the Walshes' marriage, stemming from a separate, federal criminal case against Walshe and an affair Ana was having in DC.
    


            Walshe has always maintained he had nothing to do with Ana's death. His defense team told the jury he found her dead in their bed hours into the new year, then panicked, fearing no one would believe him.
    


            Prosecutors alleged Walshe found out about his wife's monthslong affair with a man she met in Washington, DC, William Fastow, and feared losing his wife and kids to a new life she had there while he was facing the possibility of prison time and a hefty restitution bill for a federal fraud conviction.
    


            When Ana died, Walshe was still awaiting sentencing for that conviction. He had pleaded guilty to selling forged Andy Warhol artwork and was granted home confinement ahead of sentencing because he was the primary caregiver for their three kids.
    


            During the sentencing Thursday, the judge said she considered Walshe's federal conviction as she determined his punishment connected to his wife's murder. He's now serving a 37-month sentence for that federal conviction, which is set to run concurrent with his sentence in this case.
    


            “Your criminal history shows a long and well-documented history of deceitful and manipulative behavior. (I) considered your character or lack thereof, your behavior and your background,” the judge said.
    


            Digital data recovered from Walshe's devices revealed he also googled divorce and William Fastow days before his wife's death.
    


            Over two days of deliberation, jurors asked just one question, indicating they wanted to see a photo of Ana Walshe lying on a rug in the living room of their Cohasset home that prosecutors had submitted as evidence.
    


            Prosecutors told the jury the rug ended up covered in Ana's blood in a dumpster near the apartment complex where Brian Walshe's mother lived days after Ana's death. When investigators found pieces of the rug in garbage bags, they also found a piece of her necklace stuck in the fibers.
    


            In opening statements, defense attorney Larry Tipton told the jurors they would hear from Walshe about how he found his wife inexplicably dead in their bed.
    


But Walshe ultimately didn't testify, and the defense rested its case without offering any evidence.
    


            While Walshe denied involvement in his wife's death, he pleaded guilty to the illegal disposal of Ana's body and misleading police – though jurors were unaware of his pleas.
    


            In closing arguments, Tipton admitted there was indeed evidence Walshe had done both. But Tipton said there was nothing to prove his client planned to kill his wife.
    


            Walshe's conviction will be reviewed by the highest court in Massachusetts automatically, as all first-degree murder convictions in the state go before the Supreme Judicial Court.

            Hot Stocks 





            President Donald Trump's social media and crypto company is making a huge bet on a far different industry – nuclear fusion, a potentially lucrative albeit commercially unproven energy technology that could help power a suddenly electricity-starved economy.
    


            Trump Media and Technology Group Thursday announced a surprise merger with TAE Technologies, in an all-stock deal valued at more than $6 billion that would create one of the first publicly traded fusion companies. News of the deal shares of Trump Media (DJT) 35% higher in early trading Thursday.
    


            Fusion has long held the promise as a source of clean, safe, and cheap energy. And that need for energy has become more critical than ever in recent years. The surge of investment in artificial intelligence has resulted in a building spree of power-hungry AI data centers.
    


            After the deal closes, shareholders of Trump Media and TAE would own about 50% of the combined entity. The combined companies plan to begin construction as soon as next year of the world's first fusion reaction that could produce electricity on utility scale, rather than just in laboratory settings.
    


            The combination with TMTG could give TAE political clout. But it could also make it more politically controversial, particularly if it looks to receive any kind of federal government support, such as grants, low-interest loans or permitting approvals.
    


            It could also give TAE access to capital that it needs. Under terms of the deal, TMTG would provide $300 million in cash for TAE's plans. But that is likely a fraction of the cash available from some of TAE's current investors, such as Google parent company Alphabet, as well as its bevy of private equity investors.
    


            But that $300 million is only a fraction of the money that TAE needs, or expects to be able to access, once it has become a public company with this deal. Staying a private company, even with deep pocketed investors, is no longer sufficient TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer told CNN Thursday.
    


            “It's a multi-billion dollar undertaking,” he said. “The velocity you can get the capital is differentiating. If I raise $2 billion over five years I can't built the plant sufficiently fast.” He said the company has raised about $1.3 billion over the course of its 25-year history.
    


            The news comes as Trump Media's share price has plunged this year. Truth Social has struggled to gain traction, remaining a far smaller player than rival social media platforms. It has announced efforts to diversify into artificial intelligence, crypto and asset management. This is by far its most diversified investment, but one that has the potential to be by far the most lucrative if it works out as planned.
    


            Trump launched Trump Media in 2021 as part of an effort to build a counterweight to Big Tech and existing social media platforms. Trump Media went public in 2024 by merging with a blank-check company in a deal that raised billions of dollars despite the company generating almost no revenue.
    


            After Trump won election last fall, he transferred his dominant stake in Trump Media to a revocable trust that he is the sole beneficiary of and that is controlled by his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.
    


            Fusion essentially is the quest to replicate on Earth the process that powers the sun and other stars. It involves fusing atoms together to create an exceptionally powerful burst of energy, achieved using the most abundant element in the universe: hydrogen.
    


            This futuristic energy is seen as something of a clean energy holy grail as it is near limitless, produces no planet-heating pollution and unlike fission — the world's current nuclear technology — it leaves no legacy of long-term nuclear waste.
    


            Countries and private companies, like TAE Technologies, are racing to master fusion, but there are huge challenges to proving the process can work and taking it from the lab to commercial use. These are very expensive ventures that rely on fundraising until they can prove fusion is successful – which is likely still years, or even decades, away.
    


            Fusion companies raised more than $2.6 billion in the first seven months of this year, according to the Fusion Industry Association, with backing coming from a wide range of investors. But it still falls far short of the amount companies say they need to bring their first pilot plants online.
    


            Although researchers have made advances in laboratories, fusion has yet to provide energy on a commercial scale.
    


            But TAE says it is poised to be able to do just that, with plans for to start construction of the first utility-scale fusion power plant in 2026 at a yet to be determined location. But it will still take “five-ish” years to start producing electricity, Binderbauer told CNN Thursday.
    


            “TAE has more than 25 years of R&D in the lab and safely built and operated five fusion reactors and importantly proven major energy and fusion breakthroughs over the years, putting TAE at the top of the mountain in the fusion global scene in our view,” said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities, in a note Thursday.
    


            “TAE will also clearly have major political support from President Trump in our view and this importantly will create a major nuclear fusion US energy domestic bet over the coming years,” he wrote.
    


            Nuclear power has come back into vogue in recent years as artificial intelligence creates huge new demand for electrical energy to drive computers in data centers. Fusion or other sources of power could help with America's electrical supply problems without nuclear's downsides or siting controversies.
    


            “It's an arms race with China,” Ives told CNN. “The US facing major energy shortages/issues to fuel the AI data center transformational buildout over the next decade. While the US is ahead of China from an AI technology perspective, China is clearly leading on the energy front with a major surplus. If they're a US answer for fusion, it's TAE. The biggest thing missing is capital.”
    


            While Trump Media and Technology Group is not profitable, it does have significant assets, especially from its crypto currency investments. Its balance sheet showed $1.5 billion in digital assets on the books and an additional $550 million in other short-term investments.
    


            But that is a paltry amount compared to the cash on hand at various other major tech companies. For example, Google owner Alphabet has $95.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on its balance sheet.
    


            Binderbauer told CNN that TMTG proved to be the partner he was looking for to take the company public.
    


            “Sometimes you get lucky and you meet the right people,” he said. And he's not concerned that any government support it needs or receives will become more politically controversial due to his ties to Trump.
    


            “I'm not looking for anything special,” he said. “Perhaps you get more scrutinized from a regulatory perspective and that's good because it will give the world confidence that the technology is what matters.”
    


            Alphabet is one of the investors in TAE already, according to data compiled by FactSet, along with Chevron, Charles Schwab, the government of Kuwait and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who passed away in 2018, as well as a number of venture capital firms. Michael B. Schwab, founder and managing director of one of those venture capital firms, Big Sky Partners, is expected to be named chairman of the merged TMTG and TAE.
    


            Devin Nunes, the CEO of Truth Media & Technology Group, will serve as co-CEO of the combined company with along with TAE CEO Binderbauer. Nunes and Donald Trump Jr. will be two members from TMTG to join the nine-member board of the combined company.
    


            “Fusion power will be the most dramatic energy breakthrough since the onset of commercial nuclear energy in the 1950s—an innovation that will lower energy prices, boost supply, ensure America's AI-supremacy, revive America's manufacturing base and bolster national defense,” Nunes told investors on a brief call Thursday morning during which neither he nor Binderbauer took any questions. “Together with TAE, we will have the capital and public market access to scale TAE's vision to put abundant nuclear energy on the grid.”

            Crypto managed to make it through the year without a systemic collapse or a major scandal. Yet it's still shaping up to be one of the industry's worst years ever.



            Until October, bitcoin had been riding high, hitting a peak of $126,000 — up more than 30% since January. But a combination of forces has wiped out all of the bellwether token's gains for the year. It's now down 7% since January, badly underperforming the S&P 500 stock index, which is up 15% for the year.
    


            There are no more bogeymen for the industry to blame: The Biden-era regulators that suppressed crypto's expansion in the US are long gone, replaced by an openly pro-crypto regime appointed by the self-styled “crypto president.” Congress is advancing industry-approved legislation. Institutional adoption has surged, bringing in billions through bitcoin exchange-traded funds.
    


            And still, crypto can't seem to find its footing. After holding somewhat steady around the $90,000 level in recent weeks, another steep selloff sent bitcoin tumbling to around $86,000 on Wednesday.
    


            If Team Crypto is looking to point its finger for this bear market, it might consider a mirror.
    


            There are technical reasons for the slump, most notably an extreme buildup of leveraged positions — speculative bets that can turbocharge gains but come with extreme downside risks — that were liquidated in an early October flash crash. But the protracted slump appears to be about more than just a hangover from that crash.
    


            Risk appetite hasn't gone away, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq has done even better than the broader stock market. So why are investors shunning this particular flavor of risk?
    


            One explanation is that crypto culture has refused to grow up, and it's keeping would-be investors on the sidelines.
    


            Looking back on a year when crypto advocates got everything they could have dreamed of from a legal and regulatory standpoint, the industry still hasn't figured out what to do with its problem children — the scammers, thieves and internet trolls who haven't gotten the memo that crypto is trying to clean up its act.
    


            Over the summer, memecoin pushers claimed responsibility for an orchestrated effort to throw dildos onto the court during WNBA games, claiming it was an effort to “make memes funny again.”
    


            Then there are the garden variety scammers, who find in crypto a means to separate people from their money via crypto ATM schemes — an epidemic that has cost Americans more than $330 million this year.
    


            And in extreme cases, kidnappers have targeted crypto investors to compel them to turn over their digital wallet passwords. There have been more than 30 of those so-called “wrench attacks” this year, according to industry researcher Chainalysis, though it notes many of the crimes go unreported. One of those attacks made national news over the summer, when a 28-year-old crypto investor escaped from a luxury Manhattan apartment, accusing two men of holding him captive for weeks while he was beaten and threatened with death.
    


How a major convenience store chain became a hub for crypto scams



            None of that means crypto investing is wrong, per se, but it's certainly not reassuring, particularly for those who may have bought bitcoin near the peak just a few months ago and are now sitting on giant losses.
    


            “Retail investors are teetering between their fear of missing out on a juicy investment and concerns about the unsavory aspects of crypto and its promoters,” Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad told me. “Such investors will invariably amplify the volatility of crypto prices in both directions, and I think that's what we are seeing right now.”
    


            Bitcoin's rally, sparked by President Donald Trump's re-election, attracted new investors to crypto who cared more about the number going up than the cultural or political associations. But when the financial upside began to sour, Prasad said, there wasn't a lot keeping investors in the market.
    


            “While they're eager to dip their toes,” he added, “they're equally ready to pull back the moment the waters turn a little dark … all the underlying concerns that retail investors might have had about crypto are coming back to the surface now.“

The Justice Department has embarked on a months-long effort to prosecute people accused of assaulting federal officers while protesting President Donald Trump's immigration policies. A review by The Associated Press finds that prosecutors have struggled to deliver on that commitment. (AP Video by Manuel Valdes, Eugene Garcia, River Zhang, Jaimie Ding, Ryan Foley, Claire Rush, Michael Biesecker and Allen Breed)




WASHINGTON (AP) — The federal agent described her wounds as “boo-boos.”

Nevertheless, the Department of Justice aggressively pursued the alleged perpetrator. They jailed Sidney Lori Reid on a charge of felony assault, accusing her of injuring the agent during a July protest of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown in Washington, D.C.

When grand jurors thrice declined to indict the 44-year-old on the felony, prosecutors tried her on a misdemeanor.

Body camera footage played at trial revealed that Reid had not intentionally struck the agent. Instead, the agent had scratched her hand on a wall while assisting another agent who had shoved Reid and told her to “shut the f—- up” and “mind her own business.”

It took jurors less than two hours to acquit the animal hospital worker. 

“It seemed like my life was just going to be taken away from me,” said Reid, who spent two days in jail and worried she would lose her new job and apartment. “It broke my heart because this is supposed to be a good and fair country and I did not see anything surrounding my case that was good or fair at all for anybody.”

Reid's case was part of the Justice Department's monthslong effort to prosecute people accused of assaulting or hindering federal officers while protesting the Republican president's immigration crackdown and military deployments. Attorney General Pam Bondi has ordered prosecutors to charge those accused of assaulting officers “with the highest provable offense available under the law.” In a recent statement, Bondi pledged that offenders will face “severe consequences.”

The Justice Department has struggled to deliver on that commitment, however. In examining 166 federal criminal cases brought since May against people in four Democratic-led cities at the epicenter of demonstrations, The Associated Press found:




— Of the 100 people initially charged with felony assaults on federal agents, 55 saw their charges reduced to misdemeanors or dismissed outright. At least 23 pleaded guilty, most of them to reduced charges in deals with prosecutors that resulted in little or no jail time.

— More than 40% of the cases involved relatively minor misdemeanor charges, a figure that appears to undermine Trump's claims that many of those accused are domestic terrorists.

— All five defendants, including Reid, who went to trial so far were acquitted.

— Prosecutors have successfully secured felony indictments against at least 58 people, some initially charged with misdemeanors. Those people have been accused of an assortment of assaults that include throwing rocks at federal vehicles, and punching or kicking officers. Those cases are awaiting trial.




Several factors help explain the mixed record. Sometimes prosecutors have failed to win grand jury indictments required to prosecute someone on a felony. In other instances, videos and testimony have called into question the initial allegations, resulting in prosecutors downgrading offenses. In dozens of cases, officers suffered only minor injuries, or no injuries at all, undercutting a key component of the felony assault charge that requires the potential for serious bodily harm. 

Felonies carry stiff sentences, often years in prison. A misdemeanor conviction, on the other hand, typically results in no jail time or only a few weeks or months behind bars.

Former prosecutors and law professors said the AP's analysis raises questions about how the Justice Department has prosecuted protesters.

“It's clear from this data that the government is being extremely aggressive and charging for things that ordinarily wouldn't be charged at all,” said Mary McCord, a former federal prosecutor who is the director of Georgetown University Law Center's Institute for Constitutional Advocacy. “The other thing that is missing here from the way the federal government appears to be looking at these protests is there seems to be no respect for First Amendment rights. They appear to want to chill people from protesting against the administration's mass deportation plans.”

Randall Eliason, a former federal prosecutor and former adjunct professor at the George Washington University Law School, said Justice Department officials could be working on other cases instead of “minor, minor misdemeanors.”

“Many of these cases also show how the rhetoric on Twitter and in press releases and statements is not surviving the courtroom,” he said. “What that tells you is that the Trump administration is hoping to send a message and chill future protests, not pursue serious criminal cases that need to be prosecuted.”

The Justice Department said it will continue to seek the most serious available charges against those alleged to have put federal agents in harm's way.

“We will not tolerate any violence directed toward our brave law enforcement officials who are working tirelessly to keep Americans safe,” said Natalie Baldassarre, a department spokesperson. “Those who attack law enforcement will be held fully accountable for their actions, despite the best efforts of activist liberal judges who would rather see violent criminals walk free.”

From the start of Trump's second term through Nov. 24, the Department of Homeland Security says there have been 238 assaults on Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel nationwide, up from 19 during the same period last year. The agency declined to provide its list or provide details about how it defines assaults.

The assaults have occurred amid a pair of shootings targeting immigration detention facilities in Texas and the deadly attack on National Guard troops in Washington, where a former Afghan soldier who had worked for the CIA has been charged.

The administration has deployed — or sought to deploy — troops to the four cities where AP examined the criminal cases: Washington; Los Angeles; Portland, Oregon; and Chicago. Judges have blocked the deployments in Portland and Chicago, citing a lack of credible evidence there's any organized rebellion and finding that Trump administration officials had often exaggerated or lied about threats posed by protesters. A district judge and an appeals court have gone back and forth over whether Trump must give control of the troops in California back to the state.

Trump and his administration have sought to justify the military deployments, in part, by painting immigration protesters as “antifa,” which the president has sought to designate as a “domestic terrorist organization.”

“President Trump will not turn a blind-eye to the sustained campaign of violence destroying American cities perpetrated by leftists and those who enable them,” said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman. 

Short for “anti-fascists,” antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning protesters who confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists, sometimes clashing with law enforcement.

The AP's review found only a handful of references to “antifa” in court records for any of the 166 cases it reviewed. Federal prosecutors wrote in court papers that a defendant in Portland was someone who “claims a loose association with Antifa.” In another case, an FBI agent wrote in an affidavit that conservative influencers had described a protester as an “Antifa helper or agitator.”

The AP found no case in which federal authorities officially accused a protester of being a “domestic terrorist” or part of an organized effort to attack federal agents.

In affidavits for many of the Portland cases, federal agents referred to so-called “black bloc” protesters who wear all black clothing but did not use the word “antifa” to describe them.

In at least one press release, DHS has alleged a protester was a suspected member of antifa. That person was arrested outside a Chicago-area ICE facility in October while allegedly carrying a firearm. He has not yet been charged with a crime, court records show.

Five people pleaded guilty last month to terrorism-related offenses stemming from a July 4 shooting that wounded a police officer outside an immigration detention center near Dallas. Prosecutors in that case accused the defendants of being part of an antifa cell. It was not included in AP's analysis because it did not occur in one of the four cities where Trump has sought to deploy troops.

“Rioters and other violent criminals have threatened our law enforcement officers, thrown rocks, bottles, and fireworks at them, slashed the tires of their vehicles, rammed them, ambushed them, and even shot at them,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.

The AP's analysis showed that dozens of people charged with felonies have seen their offenses reduced to misdemeanors. 

Among them was Dana Briggs, a 70-year-old Air Force veteran who was charged in September with assault after a protest in Chicago. Prosecutors first downgraded the charge to a misdemeanor. After video footage emerged of federal agents knocking Briggs to the ground, prosecutors dropped the case. Prosecutors declined to say why they dismissed it.

In Portland, 28-year-old Lucy Shepherd was charged in November with felony assault after she batted away the arm of a federal officer who was attempting to clear a crowd outside the city's ICE facility. Her lawyers argued in court filings that a video of her arrest proved there had not been an assault. The video, they wrote, showed she brushed aside an officer with “too little force to have been intended to inflict any kind of injury on the officer whatsoever.” Prosecutors dropped the case.

The office of the U.S. attorney for Oregon declined to comment.

Prosecutors are not required to disclose why they sought to downgrade a charge, and much of that process is cloaked in secrecy. Legal experts said prosecutors typically take such action when they learn the evidence is weaker than expected or uncover facts that do not support a felony charge.

Court records showed that prosecutors have secured felony indictments against people who are accused of assaulting federal officers and agents in a host of ways. They have been accused of hurling rocks and projectiles at officers, punching or kicking them and shooting them with paintballs.

Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old teaching assistant at a Montessori school, was arrested and charged in October with a felony, accusing her of trying to use her car to ram into a Border Patrol agent in a southwest Chicago neighborhood. A DHS press release asserted that she and the driver of another car involved in the incident were “domestic terrorists.”

In court papers, an FBI agent alleged that Martinez and the other driver were “aggressively” driving and chasing a Border Patrol vehicle. 

When Border Patrol agents got out of their vehicle, the FBI agent wrote, Martinez drove at one of the agents. The agent was forced to open fire, the agent alleged, striking Martinez at least five times. She was treated at a hospital and released. Inside Martinez's car, authorities recovered a loaded firearm, the agent wrote.

DHS noted in a press release that Martinez had been armed with a “semi-automatic weapon.” Martinez and a 21-year-old man were charged with assaulting a federal officer with her vehicle, which was classified as a dangerous weapon. They faced up to 20 years in prison. 

Then the case fell apart.

It turned out Martinez legally owned the gun, and her attorneys contended that video footage — from security cameras and body cameras worn by Border Patrol officers — undermined the official narrative. The videos showed a Border Patrol agent steering his vehicle into Martinez's truck, rather than the other way around, her attorney said. Text messages showed the federal agent bragging about his marksmanship after the shooting.

“I fired 5 rounds and she had 7 holes,” read a text message that the agent, Charles Exum, sent to colleagues. “Put that in your book boys.” Twenty-four hours after the shooting, Exum texted, “Cool, I'm up for another round.”

Federal prosecutors last month dismissed all charges against Martinez and the other driver. Martinez's attorney celebrated the move but emphasized that his client's “life is changed forever” due to her physical injuries, trauma and long-term impacts of being publicly branded a “domestic terrorist.”

“They call this ‘Operation Midway Blitz,' but I call it 'Operation Midway Bust' because this and every case that has come out of this has fallen apart,” said the lawyer, Christopher Parente.

Joseph D. Fitzpatrick, an assistant U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, said prosecutors are constantly evaluating evidence to ensure “the interests of justice are served in each and every case.”

Legal experts said dropping cases or reducing charges are not straightforward victories for the accused. 

They noted that defendants have to hire lawyers and may face significant legal expenses. They may also be held in jail for days or weeks, potentially losing jobs and seeing their families disrupted. 

Former federal prosecutors and defense attorneys said they were surprised that the Justice Department took at least five misdemeanor cases to trial. Such trials eat up resources, and those convicted frequently receive little jail time. The experts said they were also shocked DOJ lost all five cases at trial, a sign that the cases were particularly weak. 

“When the DOJ tries to take a swing at someone, they should hit 99.9% of the time. And that's not happening,” said Ronald W. Chapman II, a defense attorney with extensive experience in the federal courts. 

The highest-profile loss involved Sean Charles Dunn, a Washington, D.C., man who tossed a Subway-style sandwich at a Border Patrol agent he had berated as a “fascist.” Dunn was acquitted Nov. 6 after a two-day trial.

Katherine Carreño was arrested in August on a felony assault charge, accused of striking a federal officer in Los Angeles. The 32-year-old was protesting with a group outside the downtown federal building when DHS security officers asked them to move out of the way of a vehicle that was trying to enter a gate, according to a criminal complaint.

Carreño, a paralegal, said it was one of many times she had gone to demonstrate in front of the federal complex where immigrants were being detained.

An officer gave “two loud commands to move back,” which all protesters did except Carreño, the complaint alleged. The officer pushed her away from the vehicle, and Carreño “raised her hand and brought it down in a slapping/chopping motion” onto the officer's arm. She did this twice before being detained, the complaint said.

Prosecutors reduced the charge to a misdemeanor and took her to trial.

Social media video shown to jurors showed an officer striding toward Carreño and pushing her back. She was not standing in front of the vehicle but to the right and slightly forward of it. The video did not show whether Carreño hit the officer.

The officer said she did not push Carreño. Some jurors, pointing to the video evidence, said they disagreed. It took them just under five hours to reach their verdict — not guilty.

The eight arms sales agreements announced Wednesday cover 82 high-mobility artillery rocket systems, or HIMARS, and 420 Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS — similar to what the U.S. had been providing Ukraine during the Biden administration to defend itself from Russia — worth more than $4 billion. They also include 60 self-propelled howitzer systems and related equipment worth more than $4 billion and drones valued at more than $1 billion.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's administration has announced a massive package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion that includes medium-range missiles, howitzers and drones, drawing an angry response from China.

The State Department announced the sales late Wednesday during a nationally televised address by the Republican president, who made scant mention of foreign policy issues and did not speak about China or Taiwan. U.S.-Chinese tensions have ebbed and flowed during Trump's second term, largely over trade and tariffs but also over China's increasing aggressiveness toward Taiwan, which Beijing has said must reunify with the mainland.

If approved by Congress, it would be the largest-ever U.S. weapons package to Taiwan, exceeding the total amount of $8.4 billion in U.S. arms sales to Taiwan during President Joe Biden's Democratic administration. 

The eight arms sales agreements announced Wednesday cover 82 high-mobility artillery rocket systems, or HIMARS, and 420 Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS — similar to what the U.S. had been providing Ukraine during the Biden administration to defend itself from Russia — worth more than $4 billion. They also include 60 self-propelled howitzer systems and related equipment worth more than $4 billion and drones valued at more than $1 billion.

Other sales in the package include military software valued at more than $1 billion, Javelin and TOW missiles worth more than $700 million, helicopter spare parts worth $96 million and refurbishment kits for Harpoon missiles worth $91 million.

The eight sales agreements amount to $11.15 billion, according to Taiwan's Defense Ministry. 




The State Department said the sales serve “U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.”

“The proposed sale(s) will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,” the statements said.

China's Foreign Ministry attacked the move, saying it would violate diplomatic agreements between China and the U.S.; gravely harm China's sovereignty, security and territorial integrity; and undermine regional stability.

“The ‘Taiwan independence' forces on the island seek independence through force and resist reunification through force, squandering the hard-earned money of the people to purchase weapons at the cost of turning Taiwan into a powder keg,” said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun.

“This cannot save the doomed fate of ‘Taiwan independence' but will only accelerate the push of the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war. The U.S. support for ‘Taiwan Independence' through arms will only end up backfiring. Using Taiwan to contain China will not succeed,” he added.

Under federal law, the U.S. is obligated to assist Taiwan with its self-defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China, which has vowed to take Taiwan by force, if necessary.

Taiwan's Defense Ministry in a statement Thursday expressed gratitude to the U.S. over the arms sale, which it said would help Taiwan maintain “sufficient self-defense capabilities” and bring strong deterrent capabilities. Taiwan's bolstering of its defense “is the foundation for maintaining regional peace and stability,” the ministry said.

Taiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung similarly thanked the U.S. for its “long-term support for regional security and Taiwan's self-defense capabilities,” which he said are key for deterring a conflict in the Taiwan Strait, the body of water separating Taiwan from China's mainland.

The arms sale comes as Taiwan's government has pledged to raise defense spending to 3.3% of the island's gross domestic product next year and to reach 5% by 2030. The boost came after Trump and the Pentagon requested that Taiwan spend as much as 10% of its GDP on its defense, a percentage well above what the U.S. or any of its major allies spend on defense. The demand has faced pushback from Taiwan's opposition KMT party and some of its population. 

Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te last month announced a special $40 billion budget for arms purchases, including to build an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called Taiwan Dome. The budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033.

The U.S. boost in military assistance to Taiwan was previewed in legislation adopted by Congress that Trump is expected to sign shortly.

Last week, the Chinese embassy in Washington denounced the legislation, known as the National Defense Authorization Act, saying it unfairly targeted China as an aggressor. The U.S. Senate passed the bill Wednesday.

Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Peter Arnett, who traveled the world covering wars from Vietnam to Iraq, has died. His son says Arnett died in Newport Beach, California and was surrounded by friends and family. He was 91.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Peter Arnett, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who spent decades dodging bullets and bombs to bring the world eyewitness accounts of war from the rice paddies of Vietnam to the deserts of Iraq, has died. He was 91. 

Arnett, who won the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting for his Vietnam War coverage for The Associated Press, died Wednesday in Newport Beach and was surrounded by friends and family, said his son Andrew Arnett. He had been suffering from prostate cancer.

“Peter Arnett was one of the greatest war correspondents of his generation — intrepid, fearless, and a beautiful writer and storyteller. His reporting in print and on camera will remain a legacy for aspiring journalists and historians for generations to come,” said Edith Lederer, who was a fellow AP war correspondent in Vietnam in 1972-73 and is now AP's chief correspondent at the United Nations.

As a wire-service correspondent, Arnett was known mostly to fellow journalists when he reported in Vietnam from 1962 until the war's end in 1975. He became something of a household name in 1991, however, after he broadcast live updates for CNN from Iraq during the first Gulf War.

While almost all Western reporters had fled Baghdad in the days before the U.S.-led attack, Arnett stayed. As missiles began raining on the city, he broadcast a live account by cellphone from his hotel room.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




“There was an explosion right near me, you may have heard,” he said in a calm, New Zealand-accented voice moments after the loud boom of a missile strike rattled across the airwaves. As he continued to speak air-raid sirens blared in the background.

“I think that took out the telecommunications center,” he said of another explosion. “They are hitting the center of the city.”

It was not the first time Arnett had gotten dangerously close to the action.

In January 1966, he joined a battalion of U.S. soldiers seeking to rout North Vietnamese snipers and was standing next to the battalion commander when an officer paused to read a map.

“As the colonel peered at it, I heard four loud shots as bullets tore through the map and into his chest, a few inches from my face,” Arnett recalled during a talk to the American Library Association in 2013. “He sank to the ground at my feet.”

He would begin the fallen soldier's obituary like this: “He was the son of a general, a West Pointer and a battalion commander. But Lt. Colonel George Eyster was to die like a rifleman. It may have been the colonel's leaves of rank on his collar, or the map he held in his hand, or just a wayward chance that the Viet Cong sniper chose Eyster from the five of us standing in that dusty jungle path.”

Arnett had arrived in Vietnam just a year after joining AP as its Indonesia correspondent. That job would be short-lived after he reported Indonesia's economy was in shambles and the country's enraged leadership threw him out. His expulsion marked only the first of several controversies in which he would find himself embroiled, while also forging an historic career.

At the AP's Saigon bureau in 1962, Arnett found himself surrounded by a formidable roster of journalists, including bureau chief Malcolm Browne and photo editor Horst Faas, who between them would win three Pulitzer Prizes.

He credited Browne in particular with teaching him many of the survival tricks that would keep him alive in war zones over the next 40 years. Among them: Never stand near a medic or radio operator because they're among the first the enemy will shoot at. And if you hear a gunshot coming from the other side, don't look around to see who fired it because the next one will likely hit you.

Arnett would stay in Vietnam until the capital, Saigon, fell to the Communist-backed North Vietnamese rebels in 1975. In the time leading up to those final days, he was ordered by AP's New York headquarters to begin destroying the bureau's papers as coverage of the war wound down.

Instead, he shipped them to his apartment in New York, believing they'd have historic value someday. They're now in the AP's archives.

Arnett remained with the AP until 1981, when he joined the newly-formed CNN.

Ten years later he was in Baghdad covering another war. He not only reported on the front-line fighting but won exclusive, and controversial, interviews with then-President Saddam Hussein and future 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden.

In 1995 he published the memoir, “Live From the Battlefield: From Vietnam to Baghdad, 35 Years in the World's War Zones.”

Arnett resigned from CNN in 1999, months after the network retracted an investigative report he did not prepare but narrated alleging that deadly Sarin nerve gas had been used on deserting American soldiers in Laos in 1970.

He was covering the second Gulf War for NBC and National Geographic in 2003 when he was fired for granting an interview to Iraqi state TV during which he criticized the U.S. military's war strategy. His remarks were denounced back home as anti-American.

After his dismissal, TV critics for the AP and other news organizations speculated that Arnett would never work in television news again. Within a week, however, he had been hired to report on the war for stations in Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and Belgium.

In 2007, he took a job teaching journalism at China's Shantou University. Following his retirement in 2014, he and his wife, Nina Nguyen, moved to the Southern California suburb of Fountain Valley.

Born Nov. 13, 1934, in Riverton, New Zealand, Peter Arnett got his first exposure to journalism when he landed a job at his local newspaper, the Southland Times, shortly after high school.

“I didn't really have a clear idea of where my life would take me, but I do remember that first day when I walked into the newspaper office as an employee and found my little desk, and I did have a — you know — enormously delicious feeling that I'd found my place,” he recalled in a 2006 AP oral history.

After a few years at the Times, he made plans to move to a larger newspaper in London. En route to England by ship, however, he made a stop in Thailand and fell in love with the country.

Soon he was working for the English-language Bangkok World, and later for its sister newspaper in Laos. There he would make the connections that led him to the AP and a lifetime of covering war.

Arnett is survived by his wife and their children, Elsa and Andrew.

“He was like a brother,” said retired AP photographer Nick Ut, who covered combat in Vietnam with Arnett and remained his friend for a half century. “His death will leave a big hole in my life.”

CHICAGO (AP) — The Chicago Bears say they're mulling a move to Northwest Indiana with their efforts to secure public funding they say they need to build an enclosed stadium in Illinois stalled.

Team president Kevin Warren insisted Wednesday in an open letter to fans that the team still prefers to build a new home on a tract of land it owns in suburban Arlington Heights, Illinois. He also said the Bears are not using the threat to cross state lines as leverage.

“This is not about leverage,” Warren said. “We spent years trying to build a new home in Cook County. We invested significant time and resources evaluating multiple sites and rationally decided on Arlington Heights. Our fans deserve a world-class stadium. Our players and coaches deserve a venue that matches the championship standard they strive for every day.”

Warren did not say where in Northwest Indiana the Bears would look to move. 

The letter comes just days before Chicago hosts rival Green Bay in a game with heavy playoff implications. The Bears (10-4) hold a slim lead over the Packers (9-4-1) in the NFC North. In their first season under coach Ben Johnson, they are trying to secure their first postseason appearance since 2020.

“Suggesting the Bears would move to Indiana is a startling slap in the face to all the beloved and loyal fans who have been rallying around the team during this strong season,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker's spokesman Matt Hill said in a statement. “The Governor's a Bears fan who has always wanted them to stay in Chicago. He has also said that ultimately they are a private business.”




The Bears' focus for a new home has fluctuated between a tract of land they own in Arlington Heights to the Chicago lakefront, and then back to the suburb. They have said they plan to pay for the stadium construction on the site of a former racetrack about 30 miles northwest of their longtime home at Soldier Field, though they would need assistance to complete the project.

“The Bears have called Chicago home for more than a century,” Warren said. “One certainty is that our commitment to this city will not change. We will continue to provide unwavering support to the community. We need to secure a world-class venue for our passionate fanbase and honor the energy you bring every week.”

According to a team consultant report released in September, they are seeking $855 million in public funding for infrastructure in order to build a stadium in Arlington Heights that could host Final Fours and Super Bowls. The Bears were also hoping the Illinois legislature would pass a bill in October that would freeze property taxes for large-scale construction projects such as the stadium, allowing them to begin construction this year. But that didn't happen.

“For a project of this scale, uncertainty has significant consequences,” Warren said. “Stable timelines are critical, as are predictable processes and elected leaders, who share a sense of urgency and appreciation for public partnership that projects with this level of impact require. We have not received that sense of urgency or appreciation to date. We have been told directly by State leadership, our project will not be a priority in 2026, despite the benefits it will bring to Illinois.”

In September 2022, the Bears unveiled a nearly $5 billion plan for Arlington Heights that also called for restaurants, retail and more, when they were finalizing the purchase of that site 30 miles from Soldier Field. Their focus moved toward building a new stadium next to Soldier Field after Warren was hired as president two years ago to replace the retiring Ted Phillips. The plan to transform Chicago's Museum Campus got an enthusiastic endorsement from Mayor Brandon Johnson but a tepid reception from Pritzker and state legislators when it was announced in April 2024.

Last spring, the team announced it was turning its attention back to Arlington Heights, citing “significant progress” with local leaders.

Since moving to Chicago in 1921, the Bears have never owned their stadium, whether playing at Wrigley Field from 1921 to 1970 or Soldier Field since then. ___

The U.S. government admitted Wednesday that the actions of an air traffic controller and Army helicopter pilot played a role in causing a collision last January between an airliner and a Black Hawk near the nation's capital, killing 67 people.

It was the deadliest plane crash on American soil in more than two decades.

The official response to the first lawsuit filed by one of the victims' families said that the government is liable in the crash partly because the air traffic controller violated visual separation procedures that night. Plus, the filing said, the Army helicopter pilots' “failure to maintain vigilance so as to see and avoid” the airline jet makes the government liable.

But the filing suggested that others, including the pilots of the jet and the airlines, may also have played a role. The lawsuit also blamed American Airlines and its regional partner, PSA Airlines, for roles in the crash, but those airlines have filed motions to dismiss.

And the government denied that any air traffic controllers or officials at the Federal Aviation Administration or Army were negligent.

At least 28 bodies were pulled from the icy waters of the Potomac River after the helicopter collided with the American Airlines regional jet while it was landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport in northern Virginia, just across the river from Washington, D.C., officials said. The plane carried 60 passengers and four crew members, and three soldiers were aboard the helicopter.




Robert Clifford, one of the attorneys for the family of victim Casey Crafton, said the government admitted “the Army's responsibility for the needless loss of life” and the FAA's failure to follow air traffic control procedures while “rightfully” acknowledging others –- American Airlines and PSA Airlines -– also contributed to the deaths.

The families of the victims “remain deeply saddened and anchored in the grief caused by this tragic loss of life,” he said.

The government's lawyers said in the filing that “the United States admits that it owed a duty of care to plaintiffs, which it breached, thereby proximately causing the tragic accident.”

An American spokesman declined to comment on the filing, but in the airline's motion to dismiss, American said “plaintiffs' proper legal recourse is not against American. It is against the United States government ... The Court should therefore dismiss American from this lawsuit.” The airline said that since the crash it has focused on supporting the families of the victims.

The lawsuit had accused the airlines of not doing enough to mitigate the risks of flying so close to helicopters around Washington, D.C., and not adequately training their pilots to handle it. 

The National Transportation Safety Board will release its report on the cause of the crash early next year, but investigators have already highlighted a number of factors that contributed, including the helicopter flying 78 feet higher (24 meters) than the 200-foot (61-meter) limit on a route that allowed only scant separation between planes landing on Reagan's secondary runway and helicopters passing below. Plus, the NTSB said, the FAA failed to recognize the dangers around the busy airport even after 85 near misses in the three years before the crash.

The government admitted in its filing that the United States “was on notice of certain near-miss events between its Army-operated Black Hawk helicopters and aircraft traffic transiting in and around helicopter routes 1 and 4” around Washington.

Before the collision, the controller twice asked the helicopter pilots whether they had the jet in sight, and the pilots said they did and asked for visual separation approval so they could use their own eyes to maintain distance. FAA officials acknowledged at the NTSB's investigative hearings that the controllers at Reagan had become overly reliant on the use of visual separation. That's a practice the agency has since ended.

Witnesses told the NTSB that they have serious questions about how well the helicopter crew could spot the plane while wearing night vision goggles and whether the pilots were even looking in the right spot.

Investigators have said the helicopter pilots might not have realized how high they were because the barometric altimeter they were relying on was reading 80 to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) lower than the altitude registered by the flight data recorder.

The crash victims included a group of elite young figure skaters, their parents and coaches who had just attended a competition in Wichita, Kansas, and four union steamfitters from the Washington area.

Retired pilot Richard J. Levy, an aviation litigation expert witness, said the government's admission of some responsibility less than a year after the crash is unusual, especially considering the amount of money that could be involved in the case. 

“They would not have done that if there was a doubt in their mind about anything the controller did or that the Army did,” said Levy.

President Donald Trump used a prime-time address Wednesday night to promote his policies and “historic” progress, while repeatedly blaming his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, for the nation's economic “mess” as he sought to calm public anxiety.

President Donald Trump says he is sending a $1,776 bonus check to U.S. troops for Christmas, indicating in a White House speech that tariffs were funding the payments as he tried to reassure a worried public about the health of the economy.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump delivered a politically charged speech Wednesday carried live in prime time on network television, seeking to pin the blame for economic challenges on Democrats while announcing he is sending a $1,776 bonus check to U.S. troops for Christmas.

The remarks came as the nation is preparing to settle down to celebrate the holidays, yet Trump was focused more on divisions within the country than a sense of unity. His speech was a rehash of his recent messaging that has so far been unable to calm public anxiety about the cost of groceries, housing, utilities and other basic goods.

Trump has promised an economic boom, yet inflation has stayed elevated and the job market has weakened sharply in the wake of his import taxes. Trump suggested that his tariffs — which are partly responsible for boosting consumer prices — would fund a new “warrior dividend” for 1.45 million military members, a payment that could ease some of the financial strains for many households. The amount of $1,776 was a reference to next year's 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

“The checks are already on the way,” he said of the expenditure, which would total roughly $2.6 billion.

Presidential addresses to the nation carried on network television are traditionally less partisan than rally speeches, but Trump gave a condensed version of his usual political remarks.




Flanked by two Christmas trees with a portrait of George Washington behind him in the White House's Diplomatic Reception Room, Trump sought to pin any worries about the economy on his predecessor, Joe Biden.

“Eleven months ago, I inherited a mess, and I'm fixing it,” Trump said. “We're poised for an economic boom, the likes of which the world has never seen.”

His holiday wishes came at a crucial time as he tries to rebuild his steadily eroding popularity. Public polling shows most U.S. adults are frustrated with his handling of the economy as inflation picked up after his tariffs raised prices and hiring slowed.

In 2026, Trump and his party face a referendum on their leadership as the nation heads into the midterm elections that will decide control of the House and the Senate.

The White House remarks were a chance for Trump to try to regain some momentum after Republican losses in this year's elections raised questions about the durability of his coalition. He openly leaned into the politics despite television networks' past reluctance to broadcast presidential addresses loaded with campaign-style rhetoric.

For example, in September 2022, networks declined to give the Biden White House a prime-time slot for a speech the then-president gave about democracy because it was viewed as too political.

Trump spoke at a rapid-fire clip with a tone that bordered at times on anger. He responded to the public frustration this year over the economy by making even bolder promises on growth next year, saying that mortgage rates would be coming down and that he “would announce some of the most aggressive housing reform plans in American history.”

Trump brought charts with him to make the case that the economy is on an upward trajectory. He made claims about incomes growing, inflation easing and investment dollars pouring into the country as foreign leaders, he claimed, have assured him that “we're the hottest country anywhere in the world,” a statement he has frequently repeated at public events.

If the argument seemed familiar, that's because it has echoes of the case that Biden made about the U.S. economy with little success. He, too, in the face of inflation pointed to the enviable rate of U.S. economic growth compared to other nations.

The hard math internalized by the public paints a more complicated picture of an economy that has some stability but few reasons to inspire much public confidence.

The stock market is up, gasoline prices are down and tech companies are placing large bets on the development of artificial intelligence.

But inflation that had been descending after spiking to a four-decade high in 2022 under Biden has reaccelerated after Trump announced his tariffs in April.

The consumer price index is increasing at an annual rate of 3%, up from 2.3% in April.

The affordability squeeze is also coming from a softening job market. Monthly job gains have averaged a paltry 17,000 since April's “Liberation Day,” when Trump announced import taxes that he later suspended and then readjusted several months later.

The unemployment rate has climbed from 4% in January to 4.6%.

Trump said that investment commitments for new factories will boost manufacturing jobs and that consumer activity will improve dramatically as people receive increased tax refunds next year. 

While emphasizing the economy, he also faces challenges on other policy fronts.

Trump's mass deportations of immigrants have proved unpopular even as he is viewed favorably for halting crossings along the U.S. border with Mexico. The public has generally been unmoved by his globe-trotting efforts to end conflicts and his attacks on suspected drug boats near Venezuela.

Trump sought to blame Democrats for the likely increase in health insurance premiums as the subsidies tied to the 2010 Affordable Care Act are expiring. Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans have sought to address that issue, but Trump has pushed back and suggested instead that payments should go directly to the buyers of health insurance instead of the companies. The president has yet to commit to a specific legislative fix.

After his speech ended and the video was no longer being broadcast, Trump turned to his gathered aides and asked them how his address to the nation went. The aides assured him it was great.

Trump then indicated that White House chief of staff Susie Wiles had told him he needed to address the nation. After some back and forth, he asked Wiles how he had done.

“I told you 20 minutes and you were 20 minutes on the dot,” Wiles said.

President Donald Trump announced a series of celebrations for the 250th anniversary of the U.S. next year in a video shared to social media Thursday, saying, ""We're going to have a good time.""

FIRST ON FOX: President Donald Trump is kicking off America's monthslong birthday bash celebrating the 250th anniversary of the country's founding with a new nonpartisan organization dubbed Freedom 250 that will lead the administration's celebrations, Fox Digital learned. 

The year ""2026 will mark a celebration of America unlike anything we have ever done, and I am grateful to President Trump for the opportunity to execute his vision for Freedom 250,"" Keith Krach, former undersecretary of state under the first Trump administration, who was named CEO of Freedom 250, said in a press release of the new organization. 

""By working alongside states, businesses, and organizations across the country, Freedom 250 will reignite the pioneering spirit that defines America to strengthen the foundation for the next 250 years of independence, opportunity, and freedom.""

The new initiative brings together states, companies and organizations to plan and participate in events celebrating the nation's 250th birthday ""by mobilizing partners and communities in all 50 states and around the world,"" Fox News Digital learned. It will work in coordination with the White House Task Force 250, federal departments, and the America250 Commission to plan and deliver on the events nationwide.

""This means so much to him personally, as it does to every single American,"" Ambassador Monica Crowley told ""Fox & Friends"" on Thursday. She likened the commemoration to America's bicentennial, saying that the organizers of America 250 were looking to recapture the feeling of the 1976 celebration.

""Some of us might remember 1976 and the bicentennial. We may not remember the details of every bit of that, but we remember how we felt,"" she said. ""And so, what we are planning with Freedom 250 is this massive monumental celebration that President Trump promised back in his first term, a celebration that really creates that feeling of a renewal of pride and patriotism.""

Trump shared a video message on Thursday morning announcing the initiative, as well as previewing a handful of high-profile events celebrating the milestone. 

""To help carry out these exciting plans, we have created a new public-private partnership. It's called Freedom 250. Working with states, companies, and organizations across the country, we will renew the patriotism, pride, and pioneering spirit of America and lay the groundwork for the next 250 years of independence and freedom. This will be a time like you've never had in your lives, America 250. Thank you, I love you all,"" he said in the video message. 

Trump touted that Americans will ""never see anything like it, and you'll ever see anything like it again"" of the line-up of events.

""As we ring in 2026, Americans across the nation will see the iconic Washington Monument illuminated with festive birthday lights to honor the start of this historic anniversary year. Then from June 25th to July 10th of next year, we will host the Great American State Fair on the National Mall, featuring pavilions from all 50 states, highlighting breathtaking innovations and celebrating America's exceptional history and culture,"" Trump said.

The line-up will include the first ""Patriot Games,"" Trump said, which is a four-day athletic event ""featuring the greatest high school athletes, one young man and one young woman from each state and territory."" The games will be held in the fall, according to the president. 

""But I promise there will be no men playing in women's sports. You're not gonna see that. You'll see everything but that,"" he quipped.  

""Celebrating the Triumph of the American Spirit,"" Freedom 250's website, launched on Thursday morning, declares of the group's focus. 

The website touting the year of celebrations includes engaging Americans with videos crafted in part by Hillsdale College, which tell ""the remarkable story of American independence."" 

The site's calendar is packed with patriotic events, including an ongoing freedom tour hitting all 50 states in the order they joined the union. The tour features Cabinet officials and local and state leaders visiting schools to highlight America's history.

The events will kick off with the Washington Monument illuminated from Dec. 31 through Jan. 5 that will mark ""the start of this once-in-a-generation anniversary year.""

Trump has been eyeing the 250th birthday for years and pledged on the 2024 campaign trail to celebrate it in grand fashion.

""The president promised in his first term, and going into this term, even as a candidate, the most monumental celebration of America for our big 250th birthday, and through Freedom 250 and so many other elements, he is delivering on these promises,"" Crowley told ""Fox & Friends.""

""As a nation, we should be preparing for the most spectacular birthday party. We want to make it the best of all time,"" Trump said in a 2023 campaign video.

The new website also offers ""toolkits"" showing Americans how to mark the milestone in their own communities, including a toolkit for teachers, one for state fairs and another tailored to rodeos.

Another section highlights America's natural beauty, 250 years of innovation and how many Americans say the nation's fabric has been woven with prayer and faith.

The nation already has held a series of events tied to the 250th milestone, including a June 14 military parade Trump hosted in Washington, D.C., for the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary. Tanks rolled through the streets, military jets roared overhead and fireworks lit up the National Mall. 

The parade fell on Flag Day, which also marked Trump's 79th birthday.

Among the lengthy list of upcoming events celebrating the anniversary is the highly anticipated White House UFC fight, which first daughter Ivanka Trump is helping facilitate, Fox News Digital previously reported.

Trump revealed in his video message on Thursday that the UFC fight will be held on Flag Day, June 14. 

""And on Flag Day, We will have a one-of-a-kind UFC event here at the White House. It'll be the greatest champion fighters in the world, all fighting that same night. The great Dana White is hosting, and it's gonna be something special. But all of this is just the beginning,"" Trump said.

Rosie Rios, chair of America250, added that the ""creation of Freedom 250 will be instrumental in providing Task Force 250 with a clear funding mechanism to advance its Presidential initiatives.""

""As the national organization charged by Congress to represent all three branches of government in planning the nation's 250th anniversary, America250's goal is to engage all 350 million Americans (""350 for 250""),"" Rios said. ""America250 will continue to focus on the values-based programming approved by our bipartisan Commission at the local, state, national and international levels, including once-in-a-lifetime celebratory moments during the 4th of July weekend. We remain committed to our continued collaboration with Task Force 250 to ensure that all Americans nationwide have ample opportunities to join in the celebration.""

In 2025 alone, Trump created a White House Task Force 250 by executive order, revived his 1776 Commission as a patriotic-education partner, and signed the massive ""big beautiful bill"" that steers tens of millions into initiatives focused on the birthday.

Fox News contributor Hugh Hewitt joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the growing Democrat divide following the government shutdown, why he considers AOC the only real winner and more. 

The Shire.

That's where I grew up, the American equivalent of the Shire. Its name is Warren, Ohio, and every other place in the U.S. like it. The American Shire was the set for television's ""The Wonder Years,"" and its kids were loosely patrolled — though we did not know it — because FDR and the Greatest Generation had made that blanket of safety possible for a time.

My part of the Shire let in very little noise from the much larger, far more dangerous world to interrupt its remarkable calm. My father, with his two brothers, had gone off to war in faraway places, but, as the cliché puts it, truthfully, ""they didn't talk about it"" and they certainly didn't want to relive it or let their children know what war was actually like.

HOW THE TRUMP TEAM IS ROOTING OUT LEGACY OF VIOLENT '60S RADICALS AND THEIR SPIRITUAL HEIRS 

""Vietnam"" passed by our family and those of our friends because Richard Nixon ended the draft and brought home the half million Americans at war there in 1969 when he took over from LBJ and JFK, who had sent them to Southeast Asia. My cousin was at Kent State on the awful day, and our next door neighbor is on Time magazine's infamous cover. That was as close as reality got to me. Echoes of the domestic upheavals were around, and the civil rights riots reached even abolitionist land in northeastern Ohio. But still, my teachers would do their best to talk about communism and the world, but only a handful of them truly ""got it."" And the veterans among them, they'd rather burn their hands on a stove than talk about the big war or the Korean War.

It was very much Tolkien's Shire, as was most of the United States, except for the families that actually fought in Vietnam. Not the protesters and the Woodstock party-goers, but the families who worried about their sons in the fight and especially those who bled and died there. 

(This was not the case for my wife's family and a small percentage of other American families — the ""Warrior class"" that had been ""Born Fighting,"" as former senator and author James Webb so aptly described them. My wife's mother, sister and brother had lost their husband and father when the destroyer he captained, the Twiggs, was stuck and sunk by a kamikaze pilot during the battle of Okinawa. My brother-in-law went from Annapolis to the Marines' Basic School and then off to the jungles of Vietnam and went back a second time as a ""Covan,"" in time for the ""Easter Offensive"" even as Richard Nixon had reduced our troops to a very low level.  There were two Americas in the 1970s. Those that fought the U.S.S.R. and its proxies at the tip of the spear, and everyone else.)

So, college in the back half of the ‘70s had nothing more dangerous than disco to worry about. The SDS faded away quickly — the original cosplayers. Once their futures were safe, they took to comfortable lives and sought out tenure. 

But, some voices even then worked harder than others — around the clock, really — to alert the naive Americans to the evils in the world. William F. Buckley, of course, and superb professors like Edward Banfield, Harvey Mansfield and James Q. Wilson, to name three who knew the score at Harvard. There were hundreds of other serious men and women teaching in those years. Many of the sports legends of that era — Washington Senators manager Ted Williams, for example — had fought in real wars (plural), not baseball fights or ""gridiron battles."" They knew too. But, the collective agreement not to talk about evil in the world suffocated much of the news about and debates raging around the real conflicts in the post-Vietnam era.

But, for me, who had cut his teeth on ""One Day In the Life of Ivan Denisovich"" when my oldest brother brought it home from college, there was Commentary Magazine and its editor, Norman Podhoretz. Through high school, National Review and Sports Illustrated had been my asks at Christmas. In college, I added Commentary.

Commentary has never not been a part of my intellectual life since learning of it in college. By the time Jeanne Kirkpatrick published ""Dictators and Double Standards"" in 1979, I'd been reading and learning from the magazine's intellectual equivalents to the 1927 Yankees for years.

The year after Kirkpatrick blasted out her truth bomb, the editor of Commentary published a memoir, ""Breaking Ranks,"" that finally put the puzzle together. How much the Hobbits didn't know about the intellectual battles of post-World War II America.

That editor/author was Norman Podhoretz, and in that book he spelled out that ideas mattered in the real world, that they had to be fought for, that communism was evil and could be contained and even defeated, and — something the always cheerful Buckley never quite spelled out, but Podhoretz did — ideological debates could be ferocious, meaning actual, heated arguments — not dorm room debates — and were worth losing friends over, even close friends. Ideas mattered because those ideas were about how countries would choose to live — or die.

I would eventually be lucky enough to interview, though not meet, Norman Podhoretz and his remarkable spouse Midge Decter. Their son John now captains Commentary and has kept it afloat with the help of a new generation of intellectual heavyweights, threading a fraught course through difficult times, especially in this era of Trump, even when it costs friends, even when you might get booed for pointing out that ""Midnight Hammer"" was the real deal and 45-47 delivered it, as well as the American Embassy to Jerusalem, when many others promised and didn't deliver and still others simply retreated from reality.

Some Americans will look up at the announcement of the death of Norman Podhoretz and have no idea what he meant. It may, or may not, be true that ""No Podhoretz, no President Reagan,"" but that it might be true is enough to say: What a great American Norman Podhoretz was.

Tim Lilley, father of co-pilot killed in DC crash Sam Lilley, discusses his fight for aviation safety changes after a National Transportation Safety Board hearing over the procedural errors that caused the January crash. 

The U.S. government acknowledged Wednesday that both the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and U.S. Army contributed to a midair collision over the Potomac River near Washington, D.C., last January that killed 67 people.

In a new legal filing responding to a lawsuit filed by the family of one of the victims, government attorneys conceded the FAA violated procedures dictating when controllers can rely on pilots to maintain visual separation, adding that the Army helicopter pilots failed to ""maintain vigilance"" to avoid the descending passenger jet.

""The United States admits that it owed a duty of care to Plaintiffs, which it breached,"" the filing stated.

On Jan. 29, an Army Black Hawk helicopter collided midair with an American Airlines passenger plane near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, killing 64 people on American Eagle Flight 5342 and three aboard the military helicopter.

The estate of Casey Crafton, one of the passengers killed, filed the first lawsuit in September regarding the crash over the nation's capital, with his wife Rachel and family leading the legal action.

U.S. attorneys admitted in the filing that the helicopter and passenger jet pilots ""failed to maintain vigilance"" and the Black Hawk pilots ""failed to maintain proper and safe visual"" separation from the American Airlines craft.

The local air traffic controller also failed to comply with FAA procedures, the attorneys said.

Robert Clifford, the attorney for plaintiff Rachel Crafton, reacted to the government's concessions, saying that the families and their counsel will ""carefully study these new filings.""

""These families remain deeply saddened and anchored in the grief caused by this tragic loss of life,"" Clifford said in a statement. ""During this holiday season, the families are especially disheartened by the shattered joyfulness without their loved ones.""

The lawsuit also targeted American Airlines and its regional partner, PSA Airlines, for their roles in the disaster, but both have filed motions to dismiss.

The National Transportation Safety Board is expected to release its report on the cause of the crash in January.

 President Donald Trump weighs in on foreign relations during a presser at the White House.

President Donald Trump's newly released National Security Strategy breaks the mold of White House strategy documents being a product of an elite policy consensus. From the outset, the document declares that America's foreign-policy establishment ""went astray,"" overextending the nation abroad and ignoring the wishes and instincts of ordinary citizens. The document presents its ""America First"" approach as a strategy grounded in the will of We the People.

Conveniently, we now have a clear picture of what the American people actually think when it comes to our most pressing national security challenges. Our Reagan National Defense Survey, released just days before the strategy, offers one of the clearest assessments of public attitudes toward national defense, foreign policy, allies and adversaries. Together, the strategy and the survey reveal a story of both striking alignment and meaningful misalignment — a mixed bag that says as much about America's evolving worldview as it does about the administration's.

On the essentials, the people and the president are in remarkable agreement. The strategy elevates ""peace through strength"" as a core principle, declaring that America must sustain ""the world's most powerful, lethal, and technologically advanced military"" to deter adversaries and maintain global stability. Americans emphatically agree. The Reagan survey shows 87% of the public believes it is important that the United States have the strongest military in the world and 71% say the world is more peaceful when America leads from a position of unrivaled strength. This is a national consensus in an age when consensus is hard to find.

AMERICA HAS TO RESPOND WITH A UNITED FRONT TO CHINA'S MASSIVE ECONOMIC WARFARE

The alignment continues when one looks at the administration's major modernization priorities. The strategy calls for a ""Golden Dome,"" a next-generation missile-defense shield for the homeland and a ""Golden Fleet"" to counter China's massive advantage in naval shipbuilding. Here too, the American people are ahead of the political class. Sixty-eight percent support major new investments to build the Golden Dome system, and when told China can produce more than 200 ships for every one U.S. ship, an astonishing 88% say the United States needs more manufacturing capacity — with 62% saying it needs a lot more. The public is not only receptive to rebuilding American military power; it is demanding it.

The strategy and polling are well-aligned on China. The NSS devotes more attention to the People's Republic of China than to any other competitor, describing how ""American elites—over four successive administrations of both political parties—were either willing enablers of China's strategy or in denial."" President Trump seeks to ""rebalance"" the U.S. economic relationship with Beijing, counter its military buildup and deter attempts to dominate strategic supply chains, framing — though not naming — China as the defining threat of this century. The American people agree. Forty-eight percent identify China as the greatest threat to the United States — outpacing Russia two-to-one — and large majorities support forward deterrence in the Indo-Pacific, including moving U.S. military assets to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack. Americans understand the stakes. They want the United States to compete — and win.

But, the places of divergence are just as revealing. For all its clarity on China, the strategy takes a more restrained tone when describing America's allies, especially in Europe. It questions Europe's economic vitality, strategic reliability and even its ""civilizational self-confidence,"" suggesting the continent may not be a dependable partner in the long run. When it comes to Russia, the strategy is relatively muted, prioritizing ""strategic stability"" in the U.S.-Russia relationship despite Russia's war against Ukraine and actions against NATO.

The American people, by contrast, are extraordinarily clear-eyed about who is a friend and who is a foe. The Reagan survey shows that 75% of Americans see Ukraine as an ally or partner, 66% say the same of Israel, and 67% of Taiwan. Survey respondents overwhelmingly favor restricting the sale of advanced semiconductors to China, with 65% supporting strict limits to prevent Beijing from gaining military or strategic advantages. Yet the Trump administration's strategy opens the door to continued chip sales — prioritizing dollar flows and commercial reciprocity over maintaining America's long-term technological edge. Meanwhile, 79% view Russia as an enemy and 77% view China as an adversary. These are not marginal views; they are overwhelming majorities. Americans are not confused, conflicted or ambivalent about where the threats lie. They see the world for what it is.

The same clarity appears in attitudes toward international engagement. While the strategy calls for a ""predisposition to non-interventionism"" and insists on a dramatically narrower definition of U.S. vital interests, Americans take a more outward-looking view. Sixty-four percent say the United States should be more engaged and take the lead internationally — not retreat or stand back — while only 33% prefer a less engaged approach. This is not a public demanding isolation; it is a public demanding leadership grounded in purpose and realism. They want America to avoid endless wars, but, they also want an American-led global order.

NATO presents another tension. The strategy's skepticism toward Europe stands in contrast to Americans' enduring support for the alliance. Sixty-eight percent of the public have a favorable view of NATO, and 76% support defending a NATO ally if attacked. Even among those who initially express support for U.S. withdrawal, large majorities reconsider when told that NATO allies have committed to raising their defense spending to 5% of GDP — a credit to President Trump's leadership on the issue. Americans agree with the strategy when it comes to fairness and burden-sharing, but they also understand that alliances are strategic assets — not liabilities.

The Middle East also reveals another disconnect. The strategy argues that the region should no longer dominate U.S. foreign policy, noting its declining importance to American economic security due to rising U.S. energy production. Yet Americans remain deeply attentive to the region's threats. Majorities support preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, favor providing military assistance to Israel under certain circumstances, and remain wary of terrorism and instability emanating from the region. Americans understand if we take our eye off the Middle East, we do so at our own risk.

Taken together, the Reagan survey reveals something profound. The American people are not isolationist. They are not naive. They are not confused about the nature of America's alliances or the threats facing the country. They are realists — clear-eyed about adversaries, supportive of our allies, committed to deterrence and overwhelmingly united around the principle that American strength is essential for global peace. President Trump's National Security Strategy captures these instincts by prioritizing developing unrivaled military power, industrial revitalization and strategic competition with China. But, its skepticism toward European allies, its relative quiet regarding Russia and its approach to the Middle East diverge from where the American people actually stand.

In the United States, national security strategies often garner little attention outside of Washington, D.C. But, allied capitals and adversaries from Beijing to Moscow read the NSS carefully and take it seriously. If ""America First"" means aligning foreign policy with the will of the American people, then the clarity of that will should guide the strategy's implementation. Americans know who their friends are, who their enemies are and what it takes to keep the country safe.

Millions of Facebook users filed claims in a recent privacy settlement after the platform was accused of mishandling user data. The approved payouts have been rolling out, which means people are watching their inboxes for updates. Scammers know this and are sending look-alike emails that push you to click a ""Redeem Virtual Card"" button. Arlene B emailed us to share what landed in her inbox.

""I received an email stating that it was from (Facebook User Privacy Settlement Administrator) and that I needed to click on the button below to ""Redeem Virtual Card."" Do you know if this is a scam or not?""

Her question shows how convincing these fake messages appear. A real settlement did happen, and people have been getting payments. Still, criminals are now piggybacking on the rollout with messages that look official but lead to dangerous sites that steal your information. Let's walk through how to tell real emails from fake ones.

NEW SCAM SENDS FAKE MICROSOFT 365 LOGIN PAGES

Scammers send fake settlement emails that mimic the real payout notices to trick you into clicking. (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)

Scammers rely on confusion and urgency. These steps help you confirm the message before you click anything.

Real settlement emails come from facebookuserprivacysettlement@notifications.kroll.com. Kroll is the official administrator.

Real notices include your unique claimant ID and reference the claim you filed last year. Fake emails skip this personalized detail.

Real payout links go to DigitalPay / Veritas or domains tied to krollsettlementadministration. If the link points to a strange or shortened URL, it is likely unsafe.

Pressure to act right away. Clumsy wording or spelling mistakes. A button that goes to a suspicious URL. You never filed a claim in the first place. Any sender address that is not the official Kroll domain.

If your claim was approved, you have already received a legitimate notice. Emails that say you must ""redeem"" again or ""confirm"" payment are signs of a scam.

GEEK SQUAD SCAM EMAIL: HOW TO SPOT AND STOP IT

A quick hover over the ""Redeem Virtual Card"" button often reveals a suspicious link that gives the scam away. (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)

Whenever a major payout occurs, criminals blend in with legitimate messages because people expect money and may open emails quickly. When fake notices look similar to real ones, it only takes one careless click for scammers to grab your data.

DON'T FALL FOR FAKE SETTLEMENT SITES THAT STEAL YOUR DATA

A person logging onto Facebook (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)

Use these simple habits to protect yourself from Facebook settlement scams and any future payout scam.

Look at the full address. Scammers often change one character in hopes you will not notice.

Check the destination without clicking. A strange URL is your warning sign.

Real administrators do not ask for banking info or logins.

Data brokers often collect your email address, phone number and other personal details that scammers use to target victims. A data removal service can pull you out of those databases, which reduces the amount of scam email that reaches you in the first place.

While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.

Check out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting Cyberguy.com.

Type in the address yourself instead of using a link from an email.

Good security software blocks dangerous links and pages. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.

Scammers want fast reactions. Slow down and confirm details. 

The Facebook settlement payout created the perfect moment for scammers to slip fake messages into inboxes. Once you know the signs, it becomes much easier to separate real notices from dangerous ones. Stay alert, trust your instincts and verify before you click.

President Donald Trump touted various victories since taking office in January, and claimed that he has rescued the American economy.

President Donald Trump touted the work his administration has done since January in an address to the nation on Wednesday night as he labeled the U.S. the ""hottest country in the world."" 

Trump blamed his predecessor Joe Biden and reiterated claims that his administration inherited a ""mess"" as he praised the work done since taking office to improve the economy, curb the influx of drugs into the U.S., and support the U.S. military. 

""Here at home, we're bringing our economy back from the brink of ruin,"" Trump said. ""The last administration and their allies in Congress looted our treasury for trillions of dollars, driving up prices and everything at levels never seen before. I am bringing those high prices down and bringing them down very fast.""

Trump also said that Americans would start to see the benefits of his massive tax and domestic policy bill that was signed into law in July. The bill included key provisions that permanently established individual and business tax breaks that were in Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and incorporated new tax deductions to cut duties on tips and overtime pay.

TRUMP SAYS ECONOMY WILL ‘ROCKET' AFTER SIGNING 'BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL': ‘IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY GREAT'

""Next year, you will also see the results of the largest tax cuts in American history that were really accomplished through our great, big, beautiful bill, perhaps the most sweeping legislation ever passed in Congress,"" Trump said. 

Trump also touted the strength of the U.S. military under his administration, citing strong recruitment numbers across the services. As a result, Trump said that military service members will receive a new so-called ""Warrior Dividend"" before Christmas – $1,776 in honor of America's founding in 1776. 

""We are sending every soldier $1,776. Think of that,"" Trump said. ""And the checks are already on the way.""

TRUMP SET TO ADDRESS THE NATION IN PRIMETIME WHITE HOUSE SPEECH AS AMERICANS REPORT ECONOMIC SQUEEZE 

Trump signed off his address claiming that the U.S. is respected once again, and is the ""envy of the entire globe"" as he wished Americans a ""Merry Christmas."" 

""Our nation is strong. America is respected and our country is back stronger than ever before,"" Trump said. ""We're poised for an economic boom, the likes of which the world has never seen. Soon we will host the World Cup and the Olympics, both of which I got. But most importantly, we will celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence."" 

The speech comes as Trump has launched a new effort focusing on his economic policies, amid criticism surrounding how his administration has handled messaging on economic issues. Scrutiny intensified following the November elections that delivered Democrats wins in several key elections – including the New York mayoral race, and the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races – where Democrats focused on ""affordability.""

While Trump told Politico in December that he would grade his economy an ""A+++++,"" voters don't share the same optimism. For example, 76% of voters reported that they view the economy negatively, an increase from 67% who reported the same in July and the 70% who said so following Biden's term, a November Fox News national survey found.

Trump has previously held several White House addresses, including in November after two members of the National Guard were shot in Washington, and another in June after the U.S. military launched strikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities.

The State Department approved a substantial weapons sale to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States on Wednesday, a diplomatic institution representing Taiwan's economic, military, and other interests.

TECRO is considered the de facto embassy for Taiwan.

The sale, totaling over $11 billion in military weapons, was announced while President Donald Trump delivered an end-of-year prime-time address to the nation. The purchases included a variety of weapons, such as drones, known as Altius Autonomous Air Vehicles, helicopter repair parts, Javelin missiles, howitzers, and tactical mission network software, among others. 

It is reportedly the largest sale of U.S. weapons to Taiwan in history.

“This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability,” read a series of releases announcing the sales issued by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. “The proposed sale will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region.”

“The proposed sale will improve the recipient's ability to meet current and future threats by enhancing the self-defense of its forces,” noted the release. “The recipient will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment and services into its armed forces.”

“The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region,” said the DSCA.  

Taiwan's Defense Ministry issued a statement recognizing U.S. assistance in providing Taiwan with vital “self-defense capabilities.”

TRUMP TO SIGN NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT ON THURSDAY

“The United States continues to assist Taiwan in maintaining sufficient self‑defence capabilities and in rapidly building strong deterrent power and leveraging asymmetric warfare advantages, which form the foundation for maintaining regional peace and stability,” read a statement by the TDM.

U.S. support for Taiwan has been a point of contention in relations with China.

Israeli officials are investigating the killing of Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Nuno F.G. Loureiro, according to a Jerusalem Post report.

Loureiro was shot inside his Brookline, Massachusetts, home on Monday and pronounced dead on Tuesday at a local hospital. Police are still searching for the suspect as part of the homicide investigation.

Loureiro, who was originally from Portugal, taught at MIT as a professor of physics and of nuclear science and engineering. He also directed the university's Plasma Science and Fusion Center.

According to the Jerusalem Post report, Israeli officials are investigating a reported possible connection between the shooting and Iran. The report says Israel's investigation is taking place “against the backdrop of Loureiro's sensitive field of research.”

“This is an assessment that has not yet been verified and is not supported at this stage by official findings from the investigative authorities in the United States,” the report reads.

The FBI declined to comment on the report.

A professor of engineering at MIT, Dennis Whyte, who also previously served as the director of the Plasma Science and Fusion Center, told MIT News that Loureiro was a “brilliant” scientist and person.

“He shone a bright light as a mentor, friend, teacher, colleague, and leader, and was universally admired for his articulate, compassionate manner. His loss is immeasurable to our community at the PSFC, NSE, and MIT, and around the entire fusion and plasma research world,” Whyte said.

In statements on Wednesday, local officials advised following updates from the Brookline Police Department and the Norfolk District Attorney's Office, as it is an open homicide investigation.

“This remains an active and ongoing homicide investigation. In order to protect the integrity of the investigation, we are limited in the information we can share at this time and ask for the community's understanding and patience.  While we investigate this incident, we will have dedicated patrol cars, officers, and unmarked units in the Gibbs Street neighborhood,” Brookline Police Chief Jennifer Paster said.

Brookline Select Board Chairman Bernard Greene also asked the community to remain patient during the investigation.

MIT PROFESSOR KILLED IN SHOOTING AT MASSACHUSETTS HOME, POLICE SAY NO SUSPECT IN CUSTODY

“We understand that, in the absence of concrete information, rumors and fear can spread among community members,” Greene said in a statement. “We also understand your frustration with what we can say at the present time, but respectfully ask that law enforcement be given the space it needs to bring the perpetrator of this crime to justice, and that the victim's loved ones be given privacy and shelter from rumors or misinformation.”

The shooting occurred days after a gunman opened fire at Brown University, killing two students. Authorities were also still searching for the gunman from the Brown University mass shooting, but said there is no evidence to suggest the incidents are related.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

EXCLUSIVE — Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) is holding out hope that the Senate can strike a bipartisan deal on healthcare, even as he leaves the door open to a go-it-alone approach that has landed House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) in hot water.

In an exclusive interview with the Washington Examiner, Thune did not rule out pursuing a Republican-only healthcare plan through reconciliation, a budget process that lets him sidestep the Senate filibuster, but made clear he is still giving space for renewed talks on Obamacare subsidies that expire at the end of the year.

“I don't rule it in or out. I mean, it's an option, and I think we want to have optionality,” Thune said of reconciliation. “I think if we came up with some healthcare policy that drives down costs and that we can't get Democrats to buy in and support, I mean, ideally, it'd be nice to have a bipartisan solution on healthcare, but absent that, I think reconciliation is always an option.”

Thune's open-ended approach is starkly different than the one pursued by Johnson, who is already promising a partisan healthcare bill in the first quarter of next year that could be passed through reconciliation.

Part of that difference boils down to a deeper well of support for the subsidies among Senate Republicans, albeit with new limits to restrict eligibility. Johnson infuriated a band of centrist Republicans for snubbing an Obamacare vote, culminating in their Wednesday decision to end-run the speaker and support a Democratic bill, yet they comprise a vocal minority of the Republican conference.

At the same time, Thune is reluctant to pursue another reconciliation bill without clear political support for the exercise. The process is not only cumbersome, forcing multiple overnight voting sessions, but some of the healthcare provisions Republicans sought to pass as part of Trump's tax bill were already ruled ineligible by the Senate parliamentarian.

“If you're going to do reconciliation, you want to have a reason to do it,” Thune said. “Obviously, it's a long, arduous process here in the Senate. And you're talking about a couple of ‘vote-a-ramas,' you got to write a budget resolution, but if there's a reason to do it, yeah.”

He suggested that any reconciliation bill would be larger than healthcare and could include provisions that did not make it into Trump's megabill earlier this year.

“There's other stuff in the tax space, a few things that probably got left on the cutting room floor in the tax bill last summer, the reconciliation bill last summer, but anything that sort of falls under the committee's jurisdiction or has a budgetary impact is eligible,” Thune said. “And so, we're always looking for candidates for a reconciliation bill in the event there's political support for doing it.”

For now, Thune is allowing Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Bernie Moreno (R-OH) to jumpstart cross-aisle negotiations after dueling healthcare proposals, one from Republicans and one from Democrats, failed on the Senate floor last week.

The deal, should one come together, would not get a vote until January 2026 at the earliest, meaning the enhanced subsidies, passed by Democrats during the pandemic, will expire at the end of the year. But Collins, who convened roughly two dozen senators on Monday to restart healthcare talks, has already released a proposal with Moreno extending the subsidies for two years and told the Washington Examiner on Wednesday that she hopes to share an updated framework later this week.

Thune also noted earlier in the day that the Senate could use the Democratic healthcare bill, slated to get a House vote in January over the objections of Johnson, as a “revenue vehicle” for an eventual deal. Republicans oppose that legislation, a simple, three-year extension, given that it does not impose new fraud and income restrictions on the subsidies, but Thune suggested it could be retooled.

In the absence of a bipartisan agreement, Republicans have begun to coalesce around a series of proposals that unify the party and do not require Democratic support. Sens. Mike Crapo (R-ID) and Bill Cassidy (R-LA), two committee chairmen with jurisdiction over healthcare, released a plan that lets Obamacare subsidies expire while directing new funds to health savings accounts.

In the House, Johnson passed a modest bill on Wednesday that expands association health plans, beefs up transparency requirements for pharmacy benefit managers, and earmarks funds for “cost-sharing reductions.”

“This is just the first of many,” Johnson told CNBC's Squawk Box on Wednesday. “We're going to do more of this in the first quarter of next year.”

President Donald Trump, for his part, has dismissed the idea of doing another big bill, declaring “we got everything” done in the first reconciliation bill, and has oscillated between supporting a bipartisan Obamacare extension and legislation that can only attract Republican votes.

THUNE CLEARS GOP MINIBUS LOGJAM WITH HELP FROM TRUMP

Crapo echoed Thune on Wednesday when asked if Republicans should pursue reconciliation again.

“I'm not talking about reconciliation right now,” Crapo said. “I think we ought to go through regular order and build a bill that gets 60 votes, if we can.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Donald Trump delivered a fear-drenched rant live from the White House.

The president of the United States just barged into America's living rooms like an angry, confused grandfather to tell us all that we are ungrateful whelps.

When a president asks for network time, it's usually to announce something important. But tonight, Donald Trump did not give anything like a normal speech or address. He was clearly working from a prepared text, but it sounded like one he'd written—or dictated angrily—himself, because it was full of bizarre howlers that even Trump's second-rate speech-writing shop would probably have avoided, such as his assertion that inflation when he took office was the worst it had been in 48 years. (Why did he pick 1977 as a benchmark? Who knows. But he's wrong.) He read the speech quickly, his voice rising in frustration as he hurled one lie after another into the camera.

We could take apart Trump's fake facts, as checkers and pundits will do in the next few days. But perhaps more important than false statements—which for Trump are par for the course—was his demeanor. Americans saw a president drenched in panic as he tried to bully an entire nation into admitting he's doing a great job. For 20 minutes, he vented his hurt feelings without a molecule of empathy or awareness. Economic concerns? Shut up, you fools, the economy is doing fine. (And if it isn't, it's not his fault—it's Joe Biden's.) Foreign-policy jitters? Zip it, you wimps, America is strong and respected. 

In effect, Trump took to the airwaves, pointed his finger, and said: Quiet, piggy.

I consider myself a connoisseur of Trump's speeches. I've watched them and live-tweeted them for years because I think Americans need to see what kind of man sits in the Oval Office. But even by Trump's standards, this was an unnerving display of fear. I can only imagine America's enemies in Moscow and Beijing and Tehran smiling with pleasure as they watched a president losing his bearings, berating his own people, and demanding that they absolve him of any blame when things get worse.

His rant contained no news, other than an example of his contempt for the U.S. military, whose loyalty he thinks he can purchase with a onetime $1,776 bonus check. This is projection: Trump has shown his willingness to be bought off with gold bars and trinkets, and he may think that the men and women of the armed forces are people of equally low character.

This was not a holiday address from the president of a great democracy to its citizens. This was a desperate tin-pot leader yelling into a microphone while cornered in his palace redoubt. Trump has been unraveling for weeks, and his speech tonight, like Trump himself, was unworthy of America and its people.

What influencers can tell us about Trump's second term.

Recently, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles did something uncharacteristic: she became the news of the day. Over the course of President Donald Trump's 2025, she had been talking to a journalist about his presidency and his core team, dishing about their personalities, quirks, and flops. Reactions ranged from shock to fascination, even though MAGA world quickly circled the wagons.

But there's a larger story here about celebrity. Wiles's interviews in Vanity Fair were not a one-off, but both a representation and a culmination of a dynamic crystalizing in Trump's second term: the Bravofication of a presidential administration.

From Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's promotional ICE videos to Vice President JD Vance, Kash Patel, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's confessional-style interviews with the former Trump official Katie Miller (Patel, the FBI director, sat down with his girlfriend, for example), as the second term has progressed, the line between the current presidential administration of the United States of America and the wild-west world of pop culture influencers and pseudo-celebrity has gotten thinner and thinner.

With all this in mind, Vox decided to reach out to Danielle Lindemann, a professor of sociology at Lehigh University, who has done exemplary work on the rise and power of reality TV. We discussed Trump's reality TV presidencies, his casting of specific heroes and villains, and whether we as an audience have been changed in the process. Lindemann suggests that there's a lot of value in comparing the average MAGA voter to a Bravo viewer who “will root for one Housewife, ride or die, despite all evidence and never admit to any flaws.”

This conversation has been edited for clarity and length.

I'm curious about why you think reality TV should be taken seriously, and why it can be a useful tool to look at the world around us. Can you explain that?

Reality TV may seem like this really kind of zany sphere populated by wacky people and ridiculous premises, but if we actually dig in a little bit more deeply, we can see that reality TV is actually kind of a funhouse mirror of our culture. It's not a pure mirror of our culture, but it does represent our cultural norms, values, and practices in a heightened form. So by seeing certain caricatures, we can come to a better understanding of ourselves.

When we do come to a better understanding of ourselves, it's interesting because we see that reality TV in a lot of ways is actually very conservative — not necessarily politically conservative — but retrogressive in terms of the values that it promotes, in terms of what it means to be a family, for instance, or what the right jeans to buy are: everything from the large to the small.

And it's important to look at reality TV, not because you need to love it — I'm not invested in whether anyone likes reality TV. (I personally do.) But when something is this much of a cultural juggernaut, it's important to pay attention because it's really this central cultural artifact that really dominates a lot of our lives. It reflects our values, but it also shapes our values as well.

Yeah, I fear I love it. Can we use it to understand or process our politics? Are there archetypes from reality TV that apply to our government?

Politics and entertainment have always been intertwined. Trump isn't the first person to draw on entertainment practices in politics, but he really has taken that to a new level, harnessing the conventions of reality TV in his politics, beginning with his first presidential run.

For example, reality TV traffics in broad archetypes. Producers cast for people that they can slot into these archetypes of the villain, the savior, the funny person, the person you love to hate. They're specifically casting to fill these roles. In the Trump administration as well, you can slot people into archetypes of the nasty woman, the bad hombre.

Why do we rely on these archetypes?

These archetypes play into what sociologists call “simple stories,” which are these basic stories that populate all of our lives: a hero and a villain, for example. It's a very easy plot line to follow. It's easy to know who the hero is. It's easy to know who the villain is. That's the bread and butter of reality TV: these simple stories that are not too difficult to follow.

“The nature of celebrity has certainly changed, and that trickles down to both politicians and entertainment figures.”

And Trump really draws on that well. I was just thinking about this in terms of his infamous post about Rob Reiner and Rob Reiner's wife Michele, the way that he used that Truth Social post as an opportunity to remind us again that Rob Reiner is a bad guy. It's always this narrative about who the enemy is, and who we should be rooting for.

I think we see that with Susie Wiles as well. Trump is reaffirming that even though Vanity Fair might have “wronged” her, she's the hero in this story. She's not a villain. So as he's reestablishing who are the people we should be rooting for, he's always coming back to this simple story and this narrative and these archetypes for his audience to understand.

There's a quote I'm thinking about from the New York Times chief TV critic during Trump 1.0, that “Trump is TV” and that he is “the mere simulacrum of a human being projected onto a flatscreen.” Is that a helpful way to view him now? The second term seems a lot less entertaining.

We did have those more fun moments in his first term. When I did interviews during that time, it was more about, “Oh, yeah, he's harnessing this idea of the cliffhanger by saying, I'm going to announce my Supreme Court Justice pick, but not until 8 pm, not until prime time in order to stir up interest, which you could argue was kind of stupid, but also it's not the level of atrocities that we're dealing with now.

Right, we used to get Trump versus reporters at his press conferences.

It's interesting to think of him as TV — just as kind of unidimensional. He's not really a person. He doesn't have interests. He doesn't root for a sports team. He doesn't have a pet. He plays golf. But in terms of personality, there's kind of no there there. Maybe it's because he is TV, he is this world of artifice, and it's hard to find the kernel of something real there.

There was a second quote I wanted to ask you about, from the New York Times in 2017. The reporters say that “before taking office, Mr. Trump told top aides to think of each presidential day as an episode in a television show in which he vanquishes rivals.” Does that still hold true today?

It's even more full-blown now, for sure. You can see it in his posts. It's not just that they're becoming more unhinged, but he's really drawing on archetypes. Almost nothing he does, including mourning the death of somebody, is unconnected from these reality TVesque narratives about heroes and villains and positioning himself as a hero.

And he is crafting an image for a particular group of people. That's also interesting from the consumption side to think about as well, that connection between reality TV and politics. We watch reality TV, but we don't really think it's 100 percent real. We know that people are cast for these shows.

But at the same time, people can still consume and enjoy it, even while understanding that it doesn't represent pure reality. There's been research on Trump and his followers, especially in that first administration, where people would say, “Well, I know that not everything he says is true,” but they're reacting to it on the level of feeling. It makes them feel good, or it makes them feel a particular way.

Let's go deeper on consumption. Have we as a society changed? Are we more TV-brained or rotted than we were? Did previous generations demand or expect their political leaders to be less stan-poisoned than we are?

The nature of celebrity has certainly changed, and that trickles down to both politicians and entertainment figures. It used to be that these politicians were these people that we saw from a removed distance. We didn't necessarily know very much about their private lives. We didn't get into the weeds of that. That has changed now with social media to the point where they feel very accessible.

Right, Vice President JD Vance could get into a Twitter fight with you, or the Homeland Security account might mock you. 

They literally are accessible because we're able to maybe even communicate with them through these platforms. But this was starting to happen before social media existed with tabloid journalism, of stars without their makeup, the breaking down of the celebrity oeuvre, the breaking down of boundaries between the viewers and the stars themselves.

As far as being TV-brained, I don't know if we're more TV-brained than we were before, but we certainly have a different relationship with our entertainers and politicians than we did before. And I don't know if that's about TV as much as it is about social media.

We're put into these echo chambers online, so if you see people who are only reinforcing your view that so-and-so is a nasty woman, you're going to become more deeply rooted in that view. We see this with Real Housewives too, in terms of absolutes, there are people who will root for one Housewife, ride or die, despite all evidence and never admit to any flaws. Even the whole reunion couch dynamic where there are the two sides, two factions. And MAGA absolutely plays into that, right? It's incredibly divisive absolutist rhetoric about who is moral and good and authentic and legitimate and deserving, and who is not.

Is this unprecedented? Did other political figures have a similar approach, albeit in the era before reality TV?

We didn't have these media platforms that we have today. It was not like Reagan was tweeting. And the rhetoric just wasn't so divisive, at least not like Trump casting certain people as villains and certain people as heroes in his everyday speech.

As far as spectacle, it's not 100 percent new. There were definitely political figures who've drawn on the world of entertainment to popularize themselves. Bill Clinton tooting his saxophone on Arsenio, Richard Nixon going on Laugh In. There's always been this idea of politics as spectacle, people making speeches to stir up people's emotions, maybe making statements that are not fully true, but to the extent to which Trump does that, and the way that he does that using these conventions of reality TV, feels very new.

My husband wondered to me if people are going to look back on this time, specifically this post about Rob Reiner and be like, “What were people thinking?” And maybe, this is now the direction in which we're headed. Can we unring this bell? Is this now the new normal?

The Vanity Fair episode, and the influencer-ish nature of this administration and the core team running the country, does that seem to suggest the answer is no? This love-hate relationship with mainstream media, of always punching back and controlling your image is very reality TV-like — the next generation seems kind of primed to keep it going.

There is that sort of basking in the media, of course, if we include social media, absolutely. But the appeal of social media, of course, is that you can construct your own narrative and control your own image. Tabloid journalists loved when reality TV came along. Because before it was difficult to get pictures of stars just going to the grocery store or whatever. That was a big deal. But reality stars actively court this. They actively court this media attention because that's the bread and butter of their whole career. They want to be featured in OK!, US Weekly, or whatever.

Even though reality stars sometimes complain about the media, and encroaching on their privacy, they also actively court it. You could draw a parallel between that and the Trump administration, who are literally publishing lists of media to avoid, while at the same time actively courting attention from the public via social media and their own preferred outlets.

The president is a desperate man.

When a president gives a primetime televised speech, it is typically about something of serious import: to make the case for a major new policy or to announce the beginning of a war.

President Donald Trump's speech on Wednesday night had no grave significance. In fact, there didn't seem to be much of a point at all.

The speech was a jumble of his usual false or even impossible claims — like a promise to reduce prescription drug costs by an impossible 400 percent — smashed together in no particular order. The speech began with a discussion of the cost of living, a subject he would drop and then return to as if just remembering that it was the number one reason his polls were low. Even the delivery was weird: Seemingly under network time constraints, the president read off the teleprompter angrily and quickly, speaking with the motormouth intensity of a 20-something banker who just discovered cocaine and now has a really great idea for a new restaurant.

So why am I writing about it at all?

Because the fact that it happened at all tells us something much more important: that the Trump administration is sinking, and his White House has no idea what to do about it.

Earlier this week, I described the president's second term governing style as “haphazardism.” Trump has basically authoritarian aims — he wants to wield untrammeled power — but has no clear plan or strategy for securing it. So what has happened so far is a series of individual abuses of power, each dangerous and damaging to democracy, but ultimately adding up to less than their parts in that they have not helped build a durable authoritarian model of governance.

Ultimately, haphazardism has put his presidency on the pathway to failure. Because the main guide to policy is Trump's own instincts, which are changeable and inconsistent and often just weird, he does things that do serious damage to his own political position. The most notable example is tariffs: a policy that has clearly contributed to his biggest problem, a high cost of living, and thus a significant driver of his collapsing poll numbers.

For the White House, this is a very hard problem to solve. While actual policy on many issues is delegated to advisers like Stephen Miller and Russell Vought, the ultimate foundation of their power is the charismatic authority of Donald J. Trump. They cannot contravene him on his personal obsessions, like tariffs or prosecuting his enemies, without risking defenestration. So getting Trump to back off entirely from some of his most self-defeating moves is off the table.

Yet the White House is staring down abysmal poll numbers, a series of schisms inside the GOP and among the conservative elite, and looming midterm elections where Democrats appear poised to make massive gains. So what can they do?

Try other stuff and see if something, anything, might work to turn the ship around. Like, say, a televised address where the president just talks — yells, really — at the country for 20 minutes

Under normal circumstances, no White House would ever greenlight such a move (and, frankly, the networks probably wouldn't go along with it). But things are looking desperate, and the Trump administration still retains a capacity to threaten private sector actors with the kind of persecution they've directed at places like Harvard. So why not demand some time on TV and see if a weird pseudo-stump speech will move the dial?

I'm not saying it's a good approach. It's not: It reeks of desperation.

But the fact that they needed to try such a desperate move at all is notable. It is the latest sign, among many, that the wheels are coming off the Trump train.

﻿Trump says he supports IVF. That's about to be tested.

President Donald Trump says he wants Americans to have more babies, and his administration is willing to try almost anything, from cash bonuses to transportation grants.

However, there is one method for conceiving children that thousands of people use every year, but that has divided the Trump White House and the larger MAGA coalition: in vitro fertilization (IVF).

Trump has repeatedly emphasized his support for IVF, even going so far as to call himself “the fertilization president” and “the father of IVF.” But some social conservatives, including high-profile groups that have been critical to the MAGA coalition and Trump's unlikely alliance with evangelical Christians, oppose IVF on religious grounds. They have backed restrictions on the procedure as well as unproven alternatives like “restorative reproductive medicine.”

Now the two camps are headed for a showdown over the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2023. The law requires most employers to offer reasonable accommodations for workers' needs arising from pregnancy, childbirth, or related conditions. A regulation implementing the law, issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2024, clarifies that those related conditions include miscarriage, abortion, lactation, and fertility treatments.

Andrea Lucas, the Trump-appointed chair of the EEOC, has signaled that she wants to revisit the Biden-era regulation. Workers' rights advocates fear the EEOC could revise the rule to exclude accommodations related to IVF, like being allowed to take time off for appointments, potentially forcing people to choose between keeping their jobs and getting pregnant.

“Employers frequently balk at IVF appointments, seeing them as elective and not as necessary,” Inimai Chettiar, president of the workplace justice nonprofit A Better Balance, told me. The protections of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act “are really critical when it comes to IVF,” Chettiar said.

When Trump announced an agreement in October that could lower some fertility drug prices, some patients and doctors were optimistic that he would make good on his promises around IVF. But now, some experts fear his administration is moving to restrict IVF access and creating an environment in which fertility treatment, like abortion, becomes ever more stigmatized and difficult to access.

Social conservatives won a big victory in the Supreme Court decision Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, and it's increasingly clear they won't stop there. “My bigger fear really is that we're going to move to the right in terms of access to reproductive medicine, reproductive care — that restricting access to abortion really was just the first step,” said Karen Guzzo, a family demographer and director of the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

For workers going through IVF, flexibility is not a luxury but a necessity. Because such treatments are often timed to a patient's menstrual cycle, scheduling can be unpredictable. “They'll suddenly call you and say, ‘Tomorrow is your retrieval,' and then you have to be out the full day,” Chettiar, who became a parent through IVF, told me. Missing an appointment can mean missing a precious chance at a successful pregnancy.

The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act aims to protect workers from discrimination or even losing their job by requiring employers to grant time off for medical appointments and other accommodations like water breaks or an excuse from tasks that require heavy lifting. The accommodations workers need are often “very basic,” Chettiar said — but before the law passed, they were too often denied. A 2013 study estimated that 250,000 women per year had their requests for reasonable accommodations rejected.

Workers without access to sick leave and those with physically demanding jobs are especially in need of the protections the law provides, said Gaylynn Burroughs, vice president of education and workplace justice at the nonprofit National Women's Law Center. So are patients of color and older patients, who may need more cycles of IVF than younger, white patients to achieve a pregnancy, Chettiar told me.

“I've talked to many women, especially in the health care industry, who had to stop IVF because they weren't able to get the time off of work,” Chettiar said.

Some workers say they've faced retaliation for pursuing fertility treatments. One woman, a manager at an Illinois Buffalo Wild Wings, filed suit earlier this year alleging that when she asked for sick leave for an IVF appointment, she was fired.

Although the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is only a few years old, “we're already seeing really tremendous impacts,” Sharita Gruberg, vice president for economic justice at the nonprofit National Partnership for Women & Families, told me. One recent study found a 9.6 percent reduction in pregnancy loss in states newly covered by the law, likely due to safer work conditions.

“We have increased birth rates from this law,” Gruberg said. “Turns out, when you create the conditions for folks to have their families and be supported and not jeopardize their livelihood in the process, lo and behold, you get babies.”

However, Lucas, the Trump-appointed EEOC chair, has long argued that the regulation implementing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is too broad. In a 2024 statement, she wrote that the rule “fundamentally errs in conflating pregnancy and childbirth accommodation with accommodation of the female sex, that is, female biology and reproduction.”

Regarding fertility treatment specifically, she writes, “the Commission paradoxically interprets a statute requiring employers to accommodate a worker's pregnancy and childbirth into a provision that also requires accommodation of a worker's inability to become pregnant.”

In 2024, Democrats held a majority on the five-member EEOC, and Lucas was outvoted. But after his inauguration, Trump fired two Democratic commissioners and named Lucas acting chair. The October confirmation of Brittany Panuccio, a Republican, solidified conservative control and set the stage for bigger moves.

Many work-life balance and gender justice advocates fear that the agency will take this opportunity to revisit the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, issuing a new rule that could exclude patients undergoing IVF. Patients receiving or recovering from an abortion have already been excluded by a federal court decision last May. (The Trump administration declined to appeal that ruling.)

A narrowing of the regulation is “something that we should be worried about, given the statement that Andrea Lucas put out,” Burroughs said. “She provided basically a road map for what she would like to change about the rule.”

Removing protections for IVF would be devastating for patients, advocates say. With more than 90,000 babies born by IVF in the US every year, thousands of workers have already begun fertility treatments with those protections in place. “It's really heartbreaking to think of a worker who's planning things out, trying to figure out how to make this work, and then has the rug pulled out from underneath them mid-process,” Gruberg said.

The anticipated changes at the EEOC come at a contentious time for the Trump administration's reproductive health and family policy.

The second Trump administration has been animated by pronatalism: the idea that birth rates are too low and that society should work to boost fertility. Vice President JD Vance, Trump ally and onetime DOGE head Elon Musk, and House Speaker Mike Johnson have all expressed concerns about America's possible population decline. Pronatalist advocates were reportedly meeting with White House staff and submitting policy suggestions this spring.

However, there's always been a split among conservative pronatalists over the role of IVF in building families. One side, loosely affiliated with the “tech right,” embraces fertility treatments as a way of boosting birth rates and even screening for IQ and other traits. On the other side are anti-abortion groups and religious conservatives who oppose IVF because human embryos are sometimes destroyed in the process.

By allowing people to have children later in life, the procedure also cuts against the cultural ideals of some conservative groups, which support earlier marriage and parenthood as an antidote to what they see as an excessively careerist and individualistic society. IVF “gives women the option of waiting longer and they would prefer people not wait longer,” Guzzo told me.

Trump himself has often touted his support for IVF, promising on the campaign trail that “under the Trump administration, your government will pay for, or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for, all costs associated with IVF treatment.” A plan unveiled by the White House in October, however, fell far short of that goal, merely offering federal guidance around employer-based IVF coverage and a deal to sell IVF medications at a discount on the forthcoming prescription portal TrumpRx.gov.

“We are very curious to see how the EEOC is going to tackle this, because there are so many different opinions on the right around IVF,” Chettiar said. “I don't know where they're going to land.”

Whatever the EEOC decides, advocates say any rollback of IVF protections would undermine the Trump administration's stated commitment to improving fertility care — and the country's birth rate.

“You can say we're going to improve insurance coverage, and we're going to do all these things, and then I can't leave work to go to my doctor's appointment,” Gruberg said. “We're looking at a future where workers under this administration would not have the actual right to access IVF.”

This major climate target has been dead for years. Now, people are finally acknowledging it.

For the last decade, global climate politics have revolved around a single number: 1.5 degrees Celsius.

The idea was that keeping the planet below this warming threshold would hold many of the worst impacts of climate change in a manageable range. Cross it, and the risks rise sharply into uncharted territory.

This year, it became clearer than ever that we will cross it.

Climate scientists have been warning for years that we've already backed ourselves into a corner where even the most optimistic forecasts of humanity's efforts to address climate change will breach this threshold. Now this year, even some of the loudest voices calling for global action to curb emissions have begun to drop the pretense.

“Scientists tell us that a temporary overshoot above 1.5 degrees [Celsius] is now inevitable,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in November. “And the path to a livable future gets steeper by the day.”

Under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, countries agreed to limit the increase in global average temperatures this century to “well below” 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) compared to the start of the industrial revolution. The goalpost for national commitments to cutting emissions of heat-trapping gases was 1.5 degrees C — or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit.

In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a team of climate change researchers convened by the United Nations, examined the differences between the two benchmarks and concluded that every bit of warming is consequential, and that in general, the hotter it gets, the worse it gets for humanity. Higher average temperatures will lead to more extreme heat waves, higher sea levels, worse droughts in some areas, and more severe floods in others.

However, last month, the UN Environment Programme estimated that the world will overshoot 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit of warming in the next decade based on current trends. To get back on track, global greenhouse gas emissions would have to fall by more than half from current levels in that timeframe, an exceedingly unlikely prospect. The United States, the world's largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, is backing away from its climate commitments and actively increasing its extraction of fossil fuels.

With the window closed on staying below 1.5°C, what happens now?

Last year, 2024, was the warmest year humans have ever measured, and 2025 is on track to take second place. These years saw excruciating disasters that killed thousands and drained billions of dollars from the global economy. Years like 2024 will become more common.

The waste from our relentless consumption of coal, oil, and natural gas has already warmed the planet by more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit compared to the 1800s.

This is a world that has already seen sea levels rise by 9 inches on average, contributing to more frequent coastal flooding and more severe storm surges. Coastal communities, home to about 40 percent of the world's population, would still have to contend with the sea level rise that occurs at high temperatures, even after the planet cools down. Glaciers are disappearing. Heat waves are longer, more frequent, and more intense now than they were decades ago. Extreme precipitation events are pouring out more water. The conditions for major wildfires are combining more often.

As the planet heats up further, these events will get worse.

While 1.5 degrees may not seem like a big increase, it's important to remember that this is an increase in the average temperature for the whole planet, from the scorching deserts to the icy poles. And an increase in the average means a larger increase in the extremes.

There may also be tipping points in natural systems, where losses to ice shelves and forests reach a point where they perpetuate themselves, accelerating shifts faster than what warming alone would portend.

That has huge implications for where we live, how we get our food, and our quality of life, yet despite these potentially cataclysmic shifts, there has been alarmingly little work done that actually games out the human implications of this world, according to Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a senior researcher at the Columbia University climate school.

“It is becoming increasingly irresponsible to focus only on the physical modeling elements of overshooting [2.7°F/1.5°Cof warming],” Kruczkiewicz said. “We need to start thinking about what the [human] scenarios look like for a post 1.5°C world.”

In a paper published in November, Kruczkiewicz and his collaborators highlighted the factors that would shape the political, economic, and humanitarian consequences of warming. For instance, while it may be possible to get back below 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit of warming after exceeding it — which some of the IPCC scenarios show that it is — we don't know whether the political will and resources even exist to make that a reality. It would take extreme measures like pulling carbon dioxide straight from the air or massive restorations of carbon-withdrawing ecosystems — an expensive proposition, especially when governments will be paying for more disasters stemming from an even warmer world.

“If you are to look at the trajectory going forward,” said Sanya Carley, a climate policy researcher at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, “we clearly will be nowhere close to 1.5°C.”

With the window slamming shut on the most ambitious international climate target, some players are starting to rethink their priorities.

Bill Gates, one of the biggest donors to international climate change efforts and a major clean energy investor, said in October that while climate change is an important problem to solve, his focus is shifting toward learning to live better as temperatures rise rather than doing everything possible to stop the planet from heating up. He also said that solving climate change is not necessarily the best way to improve the lives of the world's poorest.

“Unfortunately, the doomsday outlook is causing much of the climate community to focus too much on near-term emissions goals, and it's diverting resources from the most effective things we should be doing to improve life in a warming world,” Gates wrote on his website.

Other donors remain intent on curbing emissions. Michael Bloomberg, the UN special climate envoy, last month announced a $100 million investment in efforts to detect and reduce emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas that's about 30 times more potent than carbon dioxide.

Developing countries that contributed the least to climate change are already suffering its worst consequences, and will face even more destruction as the global temperatures climb upward.

And while wealthier countries have pledged billions of dollars to help poorer nations adapt, it's a fraction of what the most vulnerable people need to cope with more severe heat waves and deadly floods. Plus, donor countries have a track record of missing funding deadlines. That's why some developing countries have begun to argue for more financing to develop their own fossil fuel resources.

At the same time, political will to address climate change simply as a matter of protecting the environment is fading in many countries. Major companies are downplaying or backing away from their environmental ambitions as well.

But there is some good news: Wind, solar, and battery storage systems are cropping up at a record pace around the world and are beginning to outcompete fossil fuels in many markets. The prospect of more abundant and cheaper energy to improve standards of living may be the more effective argument for curbing greenhouse gases than keeping a lid on temperatures.

Humanity's ongoing efforts have already begun to bend the curve, built up unstoppable momentum, and have broken the connection between emissions and economic growth. Thankfully, some of the more extreme warming scenarios are less likely now. However, the transition to cleaner energy will still require a lot of countries and politicians working together, and that will remain a tough task — especially at the moment when countries like the US are erecting trade barriers, while others are in open war.

How much further the planet will warm is a function of how many more greenhouse gases we emit, and that remains the biggest uncertainty in any climate forecast. Though we have missed a major climate goal, every fraction of a degree matters.

Anything we can do to stabilize the climate will benefit the economy and the environment. Missing the 1.5°C target is not an excuse for giving up — it only adds to the urgency of preparing for a world we have not experienced before and preventing the situation from getting even worse.

What happens when you kill the country's climate science “mothership”?

This story was originally published by Inside Climate News and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. 

One of the world's leading climate, weather, and wildfire science research institutions is being targeted for elimination in what many of those affected see as President Donald Trump's political vendetta against Colorado Gov. Jared Polis.

• The Trump administration's move to dismantle NCAR looks less like a budget decision and more like political retaliation, landing squarely in the middle of the president's feud with Colorado Gov. Jared Polis.

• Cutting NCAR isn't a niche science fight — it touches nearly every corner of US weather and climate forecasting, from wildfire modeling to the computational backbone universities rely on.

• Scientists say you can't separate “weather” from “climate” the way Trump officials suggest, and eliminating NCAR would make the country slower and less capable at both.

• The plan mirrors the broader Project 2025 push to sideline federal climate research, raising real questions about how the US intends to navigate a world of escalating extreme weather without its top-tier science infrastructure.

Word that the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder would be broken up, with some of its functions moved elsewhere, came hours after the cancellation of $109 million in federal environmental and safety grants for Colorado, and one day after Trump took time during an Oval Office ceremony to excoriate Polis as a “weak and pathetic man.” Russell Vought, the director of the White House budget office, announced that the center would be eliminated in a post on the social media site X on Tuesday evening. His office did not respond to a request for further comment on Wednesday.

Trump's beef with Polis stems from the jailing of a former county election official in Colorado, Tina Peters, who was convicted of giving Trump allies unauthorized access to a voting machine in the aftermath of the 2020 election. An anonymous White House official told the Washington Post: “The Colorado governor obviously isn't willing to work with the president.”

Scientists affiliated with NCAR expressed shock that the center — a linchpin in climate and weather research globally — is at risk of becoming collateral damage in one of Trump's feuds.

“One theory is that this is designed to put pressure on the Governor of Colorado to allow the pardon Trump attempted to go through???!!!” wrote NCAR distinguished scholar Kevin Trenberth in an email. “Shutting NCAR would be a major setback for the entire community and would have impact[s] for decades to come.”

NCAR, founded in 1960 and administered by the National Science Foundation, provides state-of-the-art data and technology resources for 129 North American university partners. Partners rely on NCAR supercomputers, heavily instrumented aircraft and Earth-systems modeling. NCAR developed the Dropsonde, the equipment that hurricane hunter aircraft use to measure temperature, pressure, and humidity of tropical storms. The center does real-time operational forecasting for the military, for example, at the anti-ballistic missile systems site at Fort Greely, Alaska, and has done the computer modeling that has helped improve forecasting of wildfire behavior.

NCAR is “is quite literally our global mothership,” said climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe in a post on X. “Nearly everyone who researches climate and weather — not only in the US, but around the world — has passed through its doors and benefited from its incredible resources.”

NCAR is “truly an international treasure, not just a national treasure,” said Antonio Busalacchi, president of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), which manages NCAR for the National Science Foundation. UCAR has 1,450 employees, 830 of them at NCAR.

As of Wednesday midday, Busalacchi said he had received no word from Washington about the dismantling plan aside from Vought's announcement Tuesday night, linking to an exclusive USA Today story that quoted him.

Aside from meeting any political aims, the elimination of NCAR would fulfill Vought's goals of shrinking the size of government and rooting out climate science. “This facility is one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country,” Vought said in his post on X, quoting verbatim the controversial conservative blueprint for the Trump administration, Project 2025, which he helped author.

He said that critical weather work would be moved to another location, but gave no details. Daniel Swain, an expert on extreme weather at the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources and an NCAR research partner, disputed the idea that the study of climate and weather can be separated.

“Increasingly, the science has demonstrated that there is no clean separation between weather and climate,” Swain said in a YouTube livestream Wednesday. “It's the same atmosphere. It's just different timescales.”

Swain said he is only able to do his work at the University of California because all of his computing needs are met by NCAR. “There are hundreds, if not thousands, of scientists all around the country that use those NCAR resources day to day to do their science, to conduct their visualizations,” he said. “It's actually a very efficient process, in the sense that it centralizes what otherwise would be distributed, more expensive, complicated, and in many cases, therefore just wouldn't happen at all.”

He noted the irony that the NCAR community was grappling with the news at the same time that Boulder has been under an extreme wildfire risk warning — the kind of warning that NCAR's research has enabled. The local utility, Xcel Energy, preemptively cut power in the region as a result.

“If there are no major fires in the Boulder area, it is possibly at least going to be in part because these excellent weather forecasts regarding the upcoming event allowed the utilities to take preemptive action and prevent those branches and trees that might fall on power lines from igniting the fires,” Swain said.

NCAR received $123 million in funding from the National Science Foundation in the last fiscal year, accounting for one-half of its budget, according to Science magazine. NCAR receives other funding from the Pentagon and other federal agencies as well as from states and private sources. NCAR and UCAR are part of a complex of more than 30 federally funded laboratories and institutions in Colorado that have a $2.6 billion annual impact on the state's economy, according to research by the University of Colorado's Leeds School of Business.

Polis said in a statement that Colorado has not received information directly from the Trump administration about the NCAR plan or the cancellation of a wide array of transportation grants that was reported by the Colorado Sun. The cuts include a $66 million grant set to pay for a critical rail-safety mechanism in the northern part of the state, $11.7 million to electrify the Fort Collins vehicle fleet and $11.7 million to Colorado State University Pueblo to study how to power rail vehicles with hydrogen and natural gas.

If the reports are true, Polis said, “public safety is at risk and science is being attacked.

“Climate change is real,” he said. “But the work of NCAR goes far beyond climate science. NCAR delivers data around severe weather events like fires and floods that help our country save lives and property, and prevent devastation for families. If these cuts move forward, we will lose our competitive advantage against foreign powers and adversaries in the pursuit of scientific discovery.”

In a post on X, Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.), who represents the district that includes Boulder, called the plan to dismantle NCAR “a deeply dangerous & blatantly retaliatory action by the Trump administration.

“NCAR is one of the most renowned scientific facilities in the WORLD — where scientists perform cutting-edge research every day,” Neguse wrote. “We will fight this reckless directive with every legal tool we have.”

Business Insider Edition 

Human trafficking, which generates an estimated $450 billion annually, is reportedly being driven by a fiscal engine prevalent in the West African market.


        Necessitated by poverty and unemployment, the informal economy in West Africa has become a booming ecosystem for the millions of people unassisted by the formal market.
    


        While this has ensured the preservation of a considerable portion of the labor force, it has regrettably also engendered certain illegal activities.
    


        One such activity is the deeply reprehensible and largely uncontrollable human trafficking industry, an illicit operation that continues to thrive despite international efforts to curb its reach and dismantle its networks.
    


        During a recent event in Lagos on Wednesday, concerning statistics and findings were disclosed, emphasizing the significant role of the informal sector in West Africa regarding human trafficking.
    


        The International Labour Organization estimates that the money made by human traffickers is equivalent to that of some of the biggest companies in the world.
    


        According to estimates, traffickers hold 49.6 million people in modern slavery globally, including 12 million children, and the illicit sector made billions of dollars from forced commercial sexual exploitation as of 2024 (ILO and United Nations, 2024).
    


        At the opening ceremony of the GIABA-ECOWAS Gender Development Centre Regional Forum on Women and Transnational Organised Crime: Human Trafficking Risks in West Africa, GIABA Director-General Edwin Harris stated that human trafficking is widespread in the regional bloc.
    


        Represented by the Acting Director of Policy and Research, Dr Jeffery Isima, the director general stated; West Africa is a region where trafficking is most prevalent. So, again, West Africa has a lot of problems.
    


        Domestic and cross-border child trafficking remains.
    


        Traffickers do not only exploit the people's resources. They also exploit our weak financial systems.”
    


        He then went on to explain how the informal market bolsters this illicit activity, as seen in the Punch newspaper.
    


        “The informality of the economic systems that we all live in. People pay money in cash. Everything is informal. It is difficult to trace the money through the banking and financial systems.
    


        The nature of our financial system is largely informal transactions; it is cash-based, mostly.
    


        Normally, if you want to buy a car, for example, you should go to the bank or issue a cheque or pay with a bank card, but people prefer to take cash. But in most parts of West Africa, payments are made in cash,” the DG stated.
    


        “People prefer to take cash, and when you make payments by cash, you are evading traceability. It is difficult to keep track of the movement of money.
    


        If anything goes wrong with that transaction, it is difficult to trace who bought and who sold. Informality and cash transactions facilitate money laundering and other financial crimes because it is difficult to combat crime in such an environment.
    


        What we are doing to deal with it is to, first of all, help the Nigerian government to enhance financial inclusion and the cashless policy to make it take good effect so that people can do transactions, do huge or massive transactions through electronic payments, which are easier to trace if anything goes wrong,” he relayed further.
    


        The DG further noted that although women and children constitute a substantial share of human trafficking victims globally, they are also, in some instances, involved as active participants in the perpetuation of this inhumane trade.
    


        “When I say women are victims, you go like, ‘Oh, women, they are victims. You would like to be victims. No.
    


        Sometimes they are perpetrators. Sometimes, the women voluntarily, consciously take a monopoly on the process of crime. Not only that, but they also participate.
    


        They convince the young, poor girls in rural communities. In Europe, she acts as a mother who receives them.
    


        They (victims) live in her house. She provides the hostels for their lodging and prostitution. So women are involved; they are not only victims,” he said.
    


        GIABA National Correspondent and Director-General of the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit, Hafsat Bakari, represented by Mrs. Biola Shotunde, also elaborated on the subject.
    


        “According to ILO and UNODC estimates, post-slavery trafficking generates over $450bn U.S. dollars annually.
    


        This is a huge and worrisome issue. Placing it among the top revenue-generating criminal activities in the world, women and girls account for over 60 per cent of the identified victims globally, with sexual exploitation and domestic savagery particularly prevalent in our region.

        Behind every trafficked victim lies a defined financial trade: payments for recruitment, transportation, project documentation, accommodation, and exploitation.
    


        Related News EU pledges deeper security cooperation with Nigeria NECA urges evidence-based approach to sachet alcohol regulation Five Lagos, Osun herbalists face trial over fake $3m, €280,000,” she explained.
    


        “These proceeds are laundered through banks, accounts, mobile phone platforms, informal bank transfer systems, shell businesses, and increasingly through digital and crypto-enabled channels and transnational jurisdictions.
    


        For this reason, trafficking cannot be effectively tackled without integrating anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism tools into our national and regional crime systems,” she added.

Another airline is placing bets on the radical ""flying wing"" plane that industry professionals foresee as the future of commercial aviation.

California startup Natilus announced Wednesday that Indian carrier SpiceJet will order up to 100 of its new airliner called Horizon. The triangle-shaped ""blended-wing body"" (BWB) aircraft ditches the traditional tube-and-wing design for one giant, sweeping wing with the cabin built inside.

It's a more efficient aircraft that allows for more space and fewer emissions. Natilus hopes to launch Horizon in the early 2030s.

Company CEO Aleksey Matyushev said in a press release that India's growing aviation sector will be short about 2,200 aircraft by 2040 and believes his next-generation BWB could help fill that demand.

India is the world's fifth-largest aviation market with about 211 million passengers in 2024 — an increase of about 11% year-over-year, according to the global airline trade association IATA.

SpiceJet said it will help Natilus navigate India's regulatory process, with the order contingent on the Horizon ultimately being certified in the country. Natilus also plans to source manufactured parts from India and has established a subsidiary called Natilus India, headquartered in Mumbai, to support its operations.

This is the first publicly announced international airline order for Horizon, but Natilus told Business Insider that its commercial order book — which also includes its BWB cargo version, Kona — stands at more than 570 orders valued at $25 billion following SpiceJet's order.

Kona has purchase agreements with carriers like US operator Ameriflight, a partner of FedEx, DHL, and UPS, as well as Canadian airline Norolinor. However, it's unclear if Horizon has other buyers besides SpiceJet.

Horizon would bring a new type of aircraft to India's skies that promises better operating economics than those offered by the reigning Boeing-Airbus duopoly.

Matyushev previously told Business Insider that Horizon will offer improved efficiency because its wing design generates lift across a much larger surface area, cutting fuel burn by roughly 30% and operating costs by about 50% compared with similarly sized aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320.

The plane, which could carry up to 240 people in a high-capacity configuration, would also fit into existing airport infrastructure and offer about 40% more cabin space thanks to its wider footprint.

Matyushev said this could translate into unique spaces that today's jets can't fit, like a lounge or a kids' playroom.

Renderings of Horizon published in July show a futuristic business class, up to three aisles between rows of a dozen economy seats, and dedicated privacy pods.

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury recently said that it sees BWB planes as the future of aviation. But he said the jet may be windowless due to the curved structure. This means passengers could face minimal natural light, disorientation, and claustrophobia.

The wider cabin also poses additional safety challenges during emergency evacuations since those in the very center would be further from the exit doors than on today's aircraft, and the passengers and crew wouldn't be able to see the situation outside.

Matyushev confirmed to Business Insider that Horizon would have windows, but for those in the middle of the plane, it is also designing skylights and other lighting strategies to mimic the outside.

He has previously said Horizon would meet and exceed safety standards.

The BWB concept is not new. It has long been used by the US military — among the most famous being the Northrop B-2 Spirit stealth bomber — and passenger variants have been studied by innovators like Airbus, NASA, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing for decades.

Sub-scale demonstrators have flown, but no full-sized BWB has been certified for commercial use.

With a team of employees who have worked for companies like Northrop Grumman and SpaceX, Natilus is betting Horizon can break into the fiercely competitive commercial aircraft market. But it's not the only player chasing that goal.

Airbus has been experimenting with commercial BWB aircraft since 2017 as part of its ZEROe program, which aims to build zero-emission airliners that run on hydrogen instead of traditional jet fuel. That project flew a demonstrator in 2019 but has since been delayed at least a decade from its initial 2035 timeline.

Another California startup, JetZero, is developing a 250-person BWB, called the ""Z4,"" that is expected to launch in the early 2030s and offer up to 50% lower fuel burn. It could replace jets like the Boeing 767 or the Airbus A330.

United Airlines' venture capital arm, United Airlines Ventures, plans to order up to 200 Z4s. Managing director Andrew Chang previously described JetZero to Business Insider as a ""living room in the sky.""

""Everything around the customer travel experience — how they sit in the plane, board, and deplane, and how [crewmembers] serve them — can be reinvented around the new space within this new aircraft design,"" he said.

Nearly two decades ago, tech startups used to chase the distinct pedigree of being a unicorn — reaching a $1 billion valuation.

Now, fast-growing tech startups like OpenAI and SpaceX have shifted the goal posts by hundreds of billions of dollars.

The era of the hectocorn has arrived. It is a small but growing club, and you must be valued at more than $100 billion to qualify.

The next company to join the list could be Waymo, the self-driving robotaxi startup owned by Alphabet Inc. The autonomous automaker is in talks to raise billions in a new round of funding that could send its value soaring past $100 billion, multiple outlets reported on Wednesday.

Here are seven startups that have already reached hectocorn status.

One of the buzziest startups to emerge in Silicon Valley over the last decade is OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. After launching in 2022, the AI-powered chatbot attracted hundreds of millions of weekly users, cementing OpenAI's position as a leader in the AI race.

CEO Sam Altman cofounded OpenAI alongside eleven others in 2015.

OpenAI reached a $500 billion valuation in October after a secondary share sale, making it, at least for a few months, the most valuable private company in the world. The Information reported on Wednesday that it is seeking to raise many billions more at a gobsmacking $750 billion valuation.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk expanded his business portfolio in 2002 when he founded SpaceX, an aerospace startup based in Texas that has completed over 320 launches. The core mission for SpaceX is to make humanity multi-planetary.

SpaceX has secured numerous contracts with NASA. In 2024, NASA tapped SpaceX to retrieve the International Space Station from orbit in 2030 before its operational life is over.

SpaceX was the most valuable private company in the world, with a $400 billion valuation, before OpenAI surpassed it in October. SpaceX, however, is planning its own secondary share sale, which would value it at a whopping $800 billion.

The startup is also exploring an initial public offering in 2026, at a potential valuation of $1.5 trillion.

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and President Daniela Amodei cofounded Anthropic, an AI startup, alongside four others in 2021.

All of them were former employees of OpenAI.

Anthropic's main product is Claude, a family of large language models that power an eponymous AI chatbot.

Anthropic has received major investments from tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, as well as the pick-and-shovel company of the AI rush, chipmaker Nvidia.

In September, Anthopic's valuation reached $183 billion. However, Business Insider reported in November that Google is in discussions to increase its investment in Anthropic, which could boost its value past $350 billion.

ByteDance, based in China, gained widespread recognition through its popular social media app, TikTok. Although the startup introduced the app to Chinese users in 2016, it later launched an international version a year later. It also acquired the popular app Musical.ly that year, transferring all its users to TikTok, which fueled its growth.

TikTok is now one of the most widely used social media sites in the world. It specializes in short-form videos and opened a popular e-commerce retailer, TikTok Shop, in 2023.

Zhang Yiming founded ByteDance in 2012, and its current CEO is Liang Rubo.

In August, ByteDance valued itself at $330 billion as it explored a share buyback program for employees. Fidelity, an early investor in ByteDance, has valued the company even higher, at $380 billion.

Databricks is a software and AI startup founded in 2013. It is led by cofounder Ali Ghodsi, who serves as CEO. Databricks offers enterprises its Data Intelligence Platform, which manages and implements cloud infrastructure.

The startup says it uses generative AI to understand an enterprise's data, then ""it automatically optimizes performance and manages infrastructure to match your business needs.""

Databricks was on track to become a hectocorn in 2024 when it announced a new funding round to raise $10 billion, lifting its valuation to $62 billion.

Databricks recently announced it was raising over $4 billion in a new funding round, raising its valuation to $134 billion.

Brothers John Collison and Patrick Collison founded Stripe, an online payment startup for businesses, in 2010.

Stripe reached a $20 billion valuation in 2018 but has grown rapidly in recent years. The startup reached a $36 billion valuation in 2020 and $95 billion the following year after a $600 million raise.

In September, Bloomberg reported that Stripe's value had risen to $106.7 billion, putting it just barely in the hectocorn club.

xAI is Elon Musk's newest business venture, founded in 2023. The startup develops AI tools, including Grok, a large language model that powers a chatbot of the same name. Musk has implemented the technology across his companies, including X and Tesla.

Reports in November 2024 valued the startup at $50 billion. That number rose in March to $80 billion after xAI acquired X, the social media company formerly known as Twitter that Musk purchased in 2022. At the time, Musk said X was valued at $33 billion, so the two startups reached a combined valuation of $113 billion.

Multiple outlets reported in November that xAI was raising another $15 billion, at a $230 billion valuation. Musk, however, denied those reports at the time.

The VC arms of Alphabet and Nvidia have invested in Swedish vibe coding startup Lovable's $330 million Series B at a $6.6 billion valuation, the company announced on Thursday.

The news confirms an earlier story from CNBC, which reported on Tuesday that Lovable had raised at that valuation, trebling its valuation from its previous round in July, and that the investors included U.S. VC firms Accel and Khosla Ventures. 

CapitalG, one of Alphabet's VC divisions, and Menlo Ventures led the round. Alongside Accel and Khosla, Nvidia venture arm NVentures, actor Gwyneth Paltrow's VC firm Kinship Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, Databricks Ventures, Atlassian Ventures, T.Capital, Hubspot Ventures, DST Global, EQT Global, Creandum and Evantic also participated.

The fresh funds take Lovable's total raised in 2025 to over $500 million. 

""Lovable has done something rare: built a product that enterprises and founders both love,"" said Laela Sturdy, managing partner at CapitalG in a statement accompanying the announcement.

""The demand we're seeing from Fortune 500 companies signals a fundamental shift in how software gets built.""

Lovable's platform uses AI models from providers like OpenAI and Anthropic to help users build apps and websites using text prompts, without technical knowledge of coding.

The startup reported $200 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in November, just under a year after achieving $1 million in ARR for the first time. It was founded in 2023 by Anton Osika and Fabian Hedin.

Vibe coding startups have seen big interest from VCs in recent times, as investors bet on their promise of drastically reducing the time it takes to create software and apps.

In the U.S., Anysphere, which created coding tool Cursor, raised $2.3 billion at a $29.3 billion valuation in November. In September, Replit hit a $3 billion price tag after picking up $250 million and Vercel closed a $300 million round at a $9.3 billion valuation.

In this article

Micron Technology's stock jumped 12% after the company signaled robust demand for its memory chips and blew away fiscal first-quarter estimates.

During an earnings call with analysts, Micron, which makes memory storage used for computers and artificial intelligence servers, said data center needs have fueled greater demand for its products.

Micron said it expects the total addressable market for high-bandwidth memory to hit $100 billion by 2028, growing at a 40% compounded annual growth rate. Management also upped its capital expenditures guidance to $20 billion from $18 billion.

""We are more than sold out,"" said business chief Sumit Sadana. ""We have a significant amount of unmet demand in our models and this is just consistent with an environment where the demand is substantially higher than supply for the foreseeable future. 

Micron topped Wall Street estimates for the fiscal first quarter and issued blowout guidance. 

The company reported adjusted earnings of $4.78 per share on $13.64 billion in revenue, surpassing LSEG estimates for earnings of $3.95 per share and $12.84 billion in sales. 

Revenues in the current quarter are expected to hit about $18.70 billion, blowing past the $14.20 billion expected by LSEG. Adjusted earnings are forecast to reach $8.42, versus expectations of $4.78 per share.

JPMorgan upped its price target on the stock following the results, citing the favorable pricing setup, while Bank of America upgraded shares to a buy rating. 

Morgan Stanley called the results the best revenue and net income upside in the ""history of the U.S. semis industry"" outside of Nvidia.

""If AI keeps growing as we expect, we believe that the next 12 months are going to have broader coat tails to the AI trade than just the processor names and memory would be the biggest beneficiary,"" analysts wrote. 

WATCH: Micron shares spike on better-than-expected quarterly results

In this article

Trump Media and Technology Group on Thursday announced a merger agreement with TAE Technologies, a privately held fusion power company, valued at more than $6 billion.

The all-stock deal, expected to close in mid-2026, will result in shareholders of each firm owning approximately half of the combined company.

Trump Media shares — which have plummeted more than 75% since their January peak — rocketed 33% higher after the opening bell.

The major pivot for Trump Media, which operates President Donald Trump's social media platform, Truth Social, comes as America's race against China for artificial intelligence superiority has fueled massive energy demand.

There are currently no commercial plants producing electricity using fusion, a futuristic technology that carries the potential to generate abundant energy without the risks associated with nuclear power.

The merger would create ""one of the world's first publicly traded fusion companies,"" according to a press release.

Trump Media ""has agreed to provide up to $200 million of cash to TAE at signing and an additional $100 million is available"" upon signing a regulatory filing known as a Form S-4.

Trump Media Chairman Devin Nunes and TAE CEO Dr. Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEOs of the combined company, according to the release.

In a conference call later Thursday morning, Nunes said that the merger aligns with Trump Media's ""America-first principles"" and its strategy of seeking ""combinations that bring transformative technology the potential for significant, long-term value creation and dramatic societal impact.""

Listeners were given no opportunity to ask questions during the call, which ended after about eight minutes.

Nunes noted that Trump Media held more than $3 billion in assets as of November, much of which came from the hoard of bitcoin the company amassed this year as it branched out into the crypto and financial services sectors.

But Trump Media has continued to generate meager revenue, while reporting net losses in its earnings statements. The company said it brought in less than $2.7 million in revenue in the first nine months of 2025.

Most of that revenue came from advertising on Truth Social, which, despite being the president's preferred messaging platform, has struggled to compete against more established social media competitors such as Elon Musk's X.

""Upon closing, Trump Media & Technology Group will be the holding company for Truth Social, Truth+, Truth.Fi, TAE, TAE Power Solutions and TAE Life Sciences, among others,"" the companies said.

Trump indirectly owns more than 114 million shares of Trump Media. Before taking office in January, he transferred that majority stake to a revocable trust whose sole trustee is his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.

After Trump Media merges with TAE, the combined company aims to build ""the world's first utility-scale fusion power plant ... subject to required approvals.""

""Fusion power plants are expected to provide economic, abundant, and dependable electricity that would help America win the A.I. revolution and maintain its global economic dominance,"" the companies said.

TAE says it holds 1,600 patents and has raised more than $1.3 billion from investors including Google, Chevron and Goldman Sachs.

One of Russia's last remaining allies in the European Union told CNBC he believes there is no way forward for proposals to fund the rebuilding of Ukraine via frozen Russian assets. 

The European Commission – the EU's executive arm – is considering using seized Russian assets held in Europe to provide further financial support to Ukraine. 

Speaking to CNBC as officials arrived at a European Council meeting, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said proposals to use the immobilized assets as a means to assist Ukraine had been ""killed.""

""It's [a] dead end. It's over,"" he said. ""There is no sufficient level of support behind it.""

Orbán is widely seen as Russia's closest ally within the EU, and has been a vocal critic of plans to use potentially hundreds of billions of euros of frozen assets to fund reparations loans for Kyiv. Hungary isn't alone in having doubts over the measures, however. 

Belgium, whose support is critical given that huge amounts of frozen assets lie in the Brussels-based clearing house Euroclear, has expressed concern over possible legal and financial risks. Italy and Bulgaria have also supported Belgium's resistance to the proposals. 

For its part, the Kremlin has said such a move would be tantamount to justification for war, and Russia's central bank announced last week it was suing Euroclear in a Moscow court ""for recovery of losses caused to the Bank of Russia.""

The European Council meeting, due to conclude Friday, will have funding options for reparations loans to Ukraine high on the agenda. 

""Without new additional financial support from the EU and other international donors, Ukraine is expected to run out of funds early in 2026,"" the European Parliament said in a briefing Wednesday, adding that Hungary had already blocked the option to use the headroom in the EU budget to provide funding to Kyiv. Decisions on use of the EU's own finances require a unanimous vote from all 27 member states to be passed. 

""If both options proposed by the Commission are blocked, a 'coalition of the willing' could be the option of last resort,"" the European Parliament said Wednesday.

Asked ahead of Thursday's meetings if he was acting in Europe's or Russia's interests by working to block the use of Russian assets by the EU, Orbán said he was ""just working for peace.""

""I think what we have to do [is] to make some steps to peace, not to war,"" he said. 

Russian and Ukrainian forces are entering their fourth winter of fighting as peace talks drag on. Negotiations are expected to continue into this coming weekend, possibly in Miami, following weeks of talks between delegations from the U.S., Russia, Ukraine and Europe.  

Despite Orbán's take on the subject, Kaja Kallas, EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, told reporters in Brussels on Thursday that the bloc was pushing for peace alongside Ukraine, but that it was ""one sided.""

""We haven't seen any willingness from the Russian side to move or seriously talk about peace,"" she said. ""We need to put pressure on Russia, so that they go from pretending to negotiate to actually coming to the table to negotiate.""

Unlike Orbán, she struck an optimistic tone on pushing the proposals around the reparations loan and frozen assets through. 

""The proposals we are working on are addressing Belgium's concerns,"" she said. ""The issues that Belgium has raised have been addressed, so I hope we get this over the finishing line. Putin is banking on us to fail, so we shouldn't give him that.""

A spokesperson for the Kremlin did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.

The apprehension investors have surrounding Oracle has spilled over from manifesting in its stock price — which has fallen nearly 50% from its all-time high on Sept. 10 — to affecting its projects.

Asset management firm Blue Owl Capital reportedly pulled out from Oracle's $10 billion data center project over unfavorable debt terms, according to the Financial Times, as concerns about the tech giant's high level of debt mount.

The latest development adds fuel to worries that Oracle could delay the completion of data centers for OpenAI, which were first flagged by Bloomberg on Friday, though the cloud company has denied the report.

Shares of Oracle fell 5.4% Wednesday, putting its month-to-date losses more than 11%. They weighed down related names, such as Broadcom Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. 

As a result, major U.S. indexes fell. The S&P 500 retreated 1.16% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.47%, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.81% in its worst day in nearly a month. 

Despite the recent pullback in artificial intelligence stocks, the Bank of America thinks ""the AI trade may still have room to run into 2026"" — with the important caveat that shares going up does not mean a bubble isn't forming. 

""In our view, such progression validates our thesis that a larger AI bubble continues to build,"" analysts at Bank of America wrote. 

The trouble, as always, is pinpointing the exact moment before the bubble pops — if that's even possible.

— CNBC's Jaures Yip contributed to this report.

Major U.S. indexes fall on AI weakness. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average had their fourth consecutive losing session. Asia-Pacific markets mostly slid Thursday. Japan's Softbank lost around 3.7%, paring earlier losses, with the Nikkei 225 trading in the red.

China's chipmakers are challenging Nvidia. MetaX Integrated Circuits, a Chinese semiconductor firm, soared nearly 700% in its market debut on Wednesday. It's a sign of how investors are growing enthusiastic over Chinese chipmakers and their progress in catching up with Nvidia.

Netflix deal is 'superior' to Paramount's, Warner Bros. says. Samuel Di Piazza, chair of the Warner Bros. board, separately told CNBC on Wednesday that the board would have appreciated more involvement from Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison's father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.

U.S. approves arms sale to Taiwan, reportedly the biggest ever. The $11.15 billion transaction, which was given the green light on Thursday, reportedly comprises HIMARS rocket artillery systems, self-propelled howitzer systems and Javelin and TOW anti-tank missiles, according to Reuters.

[PRO] One chart is worrying Michael Burry. ""The Big Short"" investor pointed to a graphic produced by Wells Fargo that showed a phenomenon in U.S. households that has only happened twice before and preceded bear markets that ""lasted years.""

From Starbucks to Burger King: Why Western food giants are selling large stakes to Chinese private equity funds

Foreign food-and-beverage chains once thrived in China without adapting much — premium Western products practically sold themselves. Today, decisions made from distant headquarters no longer cut it.

Western brands have seen their fortunes shift as homegrown players surge ahead with competitive pricing, smart digital strategies and a sharper read on local consumer preferences. Luckin Coffee, for instance, overtook Starbucks in both sales and store count in 2023.

Correction: An earlier version of this report stated the wrong date of the U.S. government's approval of its arms sale to Taiwan. This has been rectified.

In this article

Nike is expected to report earnings after the bell Thursday as Wall Street eyes the company's progress in reigniting its business. 

The sneaker company is just over a year into CEO Elliott Hill's turnaround strategy, focusing on regaining its growth and market share, clearing out old inventory and investing in wholesale relationships.

Here's what analysts are expecting for Nike's second fiscal quarter of 2026, according to consensus estimates from LSEG:

The company is set to hold a conference call with investors at 5 p.m. ET as analysts look for a read on holiday demand. Nike's stock has dropped more than 11% this year. 

In Nike's fiscal first-quarter earnings report, Hill reported some positive developments in the company's turnaround, citing improvements in wholesale, running and North America. But Hill noted that other areas, like its China segment and direct business, have not been performing as well.

Nike expects those headwinds to continue into the new year.

Hill told CNBC in October that the company's turnaround plan is showing progress, but it will ""take a while"" to return to profitable growth. 

The sneaker giant has also been taking a hit from tariffs. In September, the company said it expected tariffs to cost it $1.5 billion and impact its gross margin by 1.2 percentage points in its current fiscal 2026. It's an increase from the $1 billion and 0.75 percentage point hit it expected earlier this year.

The company previously said it expected its gross margin for its second quarter to fall between 3 and 3.75 percentage points.

Nike also underwent leadership changes to ""remove layers,"" according to Hill, earlier this month. Under its ""Win Now"" strategy, the company announced that Chief Commercial Officer Craig Williams would leave the sneaker giant. 

Hill called the shake-up a move ""about growth and offense.""

""Collectively, these changes amount to us eliminating layers and better positioning Nike to continue to have an impact the way only Nike can,"" Hill said in a statement at the time.

The company also has reported a strong start in its NikeSKIMS partnership with Kim Kardashian's shapewear brand, which Hill previously said has seen a ""very strong"" response.

American Airlines is about to fly passengers to California for the first time on a skinny, long-range plane that it hopes will change air travel. The airline's head of network planning now has to decide where else it should fly.

The first Airbus A321XLR for a U.S. airline is scheduled to take off from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on Thursday, bound for Los Angeles International Airport.

The XLR stands for extra long range, and with the ability to go up to 4,700 nautical miles, the plane can fly much farther than cross-country, though New York to Los Angeles is a highly lucrative route.

American will focus on routes to smaller European cities from its Philadelphia hub or from New York City that might not warrant the planes in its fleet that are larger and more expensive to operate, like a Boeing 777 or Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

American's senior vice president of network and schedule planning, Brian Znotins, suggested in an interview with CNBC that he is considering destinations like Bordeaux and Marseille in France; Oslo, Norway; Stockholm; Copenhagen, Denmark; and Mallorca and Seville in Spain.

""It really opens up the menu for all these destinations that are just too small for a widebody,"" Znotins said.

The airline will debut the planes in Europe starting in March with a nonstop flight from New York to Edinburgh, Scotland.

Airlines are increasingly turning to smaller planes for longer, nonstop flights. JetBlue Airways said it would push its Airbus A321LR — a plane that sits between a regular 321neo and an XLR, for flights to Barcelona, Spain, and Milan next year. The XLR first debuted on American's partner, Spanish airline Iberia, in November 2024.

American rolled out its new interior and configuration for the jets with the first flight Thursday. 

The carrier is focusing heavily on premium seats that will take up a fifth of the plane as its executives try to catch up to more profitable rivals Delta Air Lines and United Airlines. Those two airlines in the first nine months of the year together accounted for nearly 98% of the profits of the four biggest U.S. carriers — which also include American and Southwest Airlines.

Unlike American's Airbus 321T that has 102 seats and separate first-class and business-class cabins, the 321XLRs will have 155 seats: 20 in business class, 12 in premium economy and 123 in main cabin. That is still fewer than the standard Airbus A321s that are in American's fleet and have 190 seats.

The new interior, with dark blue and caramel hues, is meant as an ""ode to Americana,"" said Rhonda Crawford, American's senior vice president of customer experience design, who previously worked at Delta.

The privacy doors on the suites, however, won't be able to be closed until early next year because of a certification hold up, an issue that has delayed deliveries of new planes as airlines seek more and more premium seating.

American ordered 50 of the XLR jets in 2019. The carrier said it expects to have 40 XLRs by the end of the decade. United also has the planes on order and expects to receive the first next year.

American retired its Boeing 757s and 767s, planes used often for international routes, during the pandemic and is now looking to rethink its network, while United — and Delta to a lesser degree — held onto older long-range jets.

American has also been increasing its investment in cabin refreshes and larger lounges. The airline said Wednesday that it will revamp its Admirals Club at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport to grow seating by 50%.

As it makes those investments, the company's executives are now trying to balance spending money — on items including new lounges and Champagne — with making money.

""You're not going to close the margin gap by just continuing to drive only cost,"" Nat Pieper, American's newly appointed chief commercial officer and a longtime airline executive, told CNBC. ""Is American going to spend more to be able to go chase premium revenue and improve our top line? Yes, we are, but let's do it smartly.""

American was the first of the U.S. carriers to place an order for the XLRs more than six years ago. The planes have an extra fuel tank that gives them longer range, ushering in an era of leaner flying for long routes that can easily top eight hours, and testing passengers' willingness to take a smaller jet. 

The 321XLR also shows how airplane manufacturers Airbus and Boeing have continued to build upon older designs of aircraft over creating an all-new plane.

The U.S. on Thursday approved $11.15 billion in arms sale to Taiwan, reportedly its largest deal to the island as it faces growing threats from China and has been a subject of diplomatic tensions between Beijing and Tokyo.

The move drew a sharp response from Beijing, with its foreign affairs spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, accusing the U.S. of violating the ""one-China principle."" 

""By aiding Taiwan's independence through arms sales, the U.S. will only end up harming itself. Any attempt to use Taiwan to contain China is doomed to fail,"" Guo said, according to a CNBC translation of his speech in Mandarin.

The Taiwanese defense ministry said the sale — comprising artillery systems, antitank missiles, as well as spare parts for helicopters and antiship missiles — falls under the $40 billion supplementary defense budget announced by President Lai Ching-te in November.

Lai last month vowed to build up Taiwan's self-defense capabilities in the face of growing threats from Beijing, seeking to achieve a high level of combat readiness by 2027. He also warned that China was aiming to seize the island by 2027. 

Lai cautioned of an ""unprecedented military buildup"" by Beijing and ""intensifying provocations in the Taiwan Strait, in the East and South China Seas, and across the Indo-Pacific.""

On Wednesday, Taiwan's defense ministry said in a post on X that China's Fujian aircraft carrier sailed through the Taiwan Strait, adding its armed forces had ""monitored the situation and responded."" 

In response to Taiwan's supplementary budget, a spokesperson for Chinese foreign ministry said at a press briefing that ""the Democratic Progressive Party's plan of resisting reunification and seeking independence using armed forces is doomed to fail,"" referring to Taiwan's ruling party.

China has been piling pressure on Taipei and has conducted several military drills off the coast of the island over the past few years, issuing stern warnings over Taiwan's ""provocations for independence.""

Beijing considers democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and Chinese President Xi Jinping regards its reunification with the mainland ""a historical inevitability."" Taiwan rejects those claims.

Speaking to CNBC on Thursday, Matt Gertken, chief geopolitical strategist at BCA Research, said that the U.S. move was President Donald Trump's way of ""restoring some deterrence to Taiwan,"" while continuing to negotiate on trade with China.  

""So he's saying to China, we're willing to trade. We're not going to cut off your semiconductors completely, but we're not going to let you attack Taiwan,"" Gertken added. 

The U.S. package, the biggest on record as per Reuters, comprises 82 HIMARS rocket artillery systems and related equipment worth $4.05 billion, including 420 ATACMS missiles with a range of up to 300 kilometers, as well as unmanned surveillance systems and military software.

It also includes 60 M109A7 self-propelled howitzer systems and related equipment worth more than $4 billion, as well as Javelin and TOW antitank missiles worth more than $700 million.

""It [arms package] seriously infringes upon China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. It gravely undermines peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and sends a seriously wrong signal to the separatist forces for Taiwan independence,"" Guo said. 

The U.S. does not have a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan and is not obligated to defend the island. 

However, the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act states the U.S. ""will make available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense services"" as may be necessary to ""enable Taiwan to maintain sufficient self-defense capabilities.""

In November, China unleashed fiery rhetoric against Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, after she said that an attempt to seize Taiwan by force could trigger the intervention of Japan's Self-Defense Forces. 

Beijing, which has called on Takaichi to withdraw her statement and apologize, has advised its citizens not to visit Japan as it continues to be locked in a diplomatic spat with Tokyo.

Monday - Friday, 11:00 - 12:00 SIN/HK  |  0500 - 06:00 CET

This report is from this week's CNBC's ""Inside India"" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse. Subscribe here.

India-U.S. relationship looked set to reach new heights at the start of 2025. 

Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the earliest foreign leaders to meet the newly elected U.S. President Donald Trump in February, just hours after he signed a plan to introduce ""reciprocal tariffs."" 

The optics were powerful as the leaders of the world's largest and oldest democracies shook hands, and vowed to double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030, with Modi stating, ""Our teams will work on concluding very soon, a mutually beneficial trade agreement.""

Cut to December, and India is among the highest tariffed countries in the world — levies that dwarf even those on China, which had been in Trump's crosshairs during his election campaign.      

India and U.S. have ""strong economic incentives"" to reach an agreement, said Sonal Varma, Nomura's chief economist, India and Asia ex-Japan. The U.S. needs reliable supply chain partners outside China, and India offers scale and capability while New Delhi needs market access to Washington to sustain its export-led growth ambitions, she said.

Yet, negotiations appear to have hit a wall. A U.S. trade delegation wrapped up another rounds of talks in New Delhi last week, with no breakthrough, though U.S. Ambassador to India Sergio Gor described a call between Modi and Trump as ""great.""   

""I think the biggest roadblock is political will,"" said Mark Linscott, former assistant U.S. trade representative and senior advisor at U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum, adding that ""tariffs and agriculture are always difficult.""

He suggests that one of the ways to get Trump on board would be with a ""big gesture"" such as an ""offer to purchase U.S. fuel ethanol or sustainable aviation fuel.""

While the U.S. seeks to improve its trade balance with the world's fastest growing major economy by increasing sales of energy and farm products, India has only partially agreed on the energy sourcing front and has been resisting access to the politically sensitive farm sector.

""There's resistance in India to certain row crops and other meats and products,"" U.S Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told the Senate earlier this month, adding ""they're [a] very difficult nut to crack.""

India has been under pressure from the U.S. to cut back on its imports of Russian oil as Washington claims this enables Moscow to withstand pressure of economic sanctions by the West and continue its war against Ukraine.

In August, the U.S. imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising total duties to as high as 50%, to deter to New Delhi from buying Russian oil.

While the U.S. has acknowledged that New Delhi has cut back on oil imports from Russia, during his visit to India earlier this month President Vladimir Putin said Moscow was willing to provide ""uninterrupted shipments of fuel to India.""

India has officially not stated that it would cut back on oil shipments from Russia. 

""Our energy sourcing is dependent on the dynamics in the global market, as also the imperative for us to provide energy at affordable rates to our 1.4 billion people,"" the foreign ministry said earlier this month, refusing to intervene on oil sourcing by private refiners.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that Indian refiners resumed buying oil from Russian companies that were not part of U.S. sanctions in November and who are ""offering deep discounts.""

While experts believe a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, putting an end to the conflict, would annul the 25% ""punitive"" tariffs on India, giving the U.S. access to the agriculture market would remain a major sticking point, holding back a trade deal. 

Varma of Nomura said that agriculture was the ""primary stumbling block"" as the U.S. wants India to buy genetically modified crops and allow dairy exports – both face strong opposition from the country's domestic farm lobby, which wields significant political influence.

This gains further significance as more major Indian state elections are due next year, such as in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala, which have strong farming lobbies, followed by Uttar Pradesh in 2027 — the country's largest agricultural state.

While New Delhi and Washington are negotiating for a mutually beneficial deal, the delay is proving expensive.

""A prolonged absence of the deal does have real economic implications,"" said Pradeep Gupta, chairman and managing director of Anand Rathi Share & Stock Brokers, adding that capital flows due to ""significant volatility,"" also reflected in a weakening rupee, were an immediate concern.

The absence of a trade deal keeps markets ""somewhat cautious,"" especially when it comes to sectors that are ""dependent on the U.S.,"" said Gupta, adding that the moment there is clarity on the trade front, there will be ""meaningful reduction in uncertainty premiums."" In other words, Indian equities could see a sharp rally.

His firm estimates that a 50% duty could shave about 0.5 percentage point off India's GDP growth, with a meaningful impact on export volumes. Goldman Sachs expects the Indian economy to be impacted by 0.6 percentage points due U.S. tariffs.   

India's exports saw a sharp fall in October, though they have mostly been on an upward trajectory despite the tariffs coming into effect. 

""India has weathered the shocks of the 50% tariffs quite well,"" and has managed to workaround them, but in the end the U.S. remains a top export destination for Indian products,"" Michael Kugelman, Atlantic Council's senior fellow for the South Asia region, said on CNBC's ""Inside India.""

""India is going to have to make some politically risky decisions,"" he said, adding that it was still unclear if there would be a deal anytime soon.

The absence of a trade deal with the U.S. ""has been a serious overhang on India,"" Citi's chief India economist, Samiran Chakraborty, said last week, while discussing India's prospects for 2026.

Meanwhile, experts in the U.S. say that tariffs are accentuating the affordability problems for families across the U.S by contributing to inflation.

""Those punitive tariffs [on India] harm U.S. consumers who will spend more on a wide range of goods,"" said Wayne Winegarden, senior fellow in economics at the Pacific Research Institute.

""The arbitrary, unnecessary, and pointless trade war created by President Trump is creating difficulties for the U.S.-Indian relationship,"" said Winegarden, warning that this deterioration of the relationship is bad for both countries.

To foot the bill for President Trump's new tariffs, some small U.S. businesses are taking on high-interest rate loans and other forms of debt, with several business owners warning they fear a financial disaster.

Analysts from India also say that American importers of pharmaceuticals, machinery, and even consumer goods, are experiencing higher input costs and supply-chain friction.

But, despite all the economic reasoning in favor of a trade deal, talk of India being an ""important strategic partner"" and Prime Minister Modi being ""a great friend,"" experts do not see great progress toward an agreement as the year ends.  

""[At] the beginning of the year we thought India will be the first country to get a trade deal, and now end of the year, it is the last country which has not got a trade deal,"" Citi's Chakraborty said.

Will the New Year bring fresh ideas from both sides to the table? Watch this space. 

Rajiv Batra, head of Asia equity strategy and co-head of global EM equity at JPMorgan, said his firm is overweight on Indian equities and expects earnings recovery and potential double-digit growth in the upcoming quarters.

Ajay Sahai, director-general and CEO of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said that about 50% India's exports are still insulated from tariffs despite the lack of a U.S.-India trade deal, and that exporters are still largely absorbing the costs as they wait for levies to ease.

Michael Kugelman, Atlantic Council's senior fellow for the South Asia region, said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Jordan, Ethiopia and Oman was an opportunity to bolster commercial ties as India faces trade uncertainty with the U.S.

India's goods exports rise in November. Exports in November rose 19% on year to $38.13 billion, with sharp improvement in the country's trade with the U.S. The country's merchandise trade deficit, which had touched a record high of roughly $41.7 billion in October, shrank to $24.5 billion in November, beating analysts' estimates.

Inflation rises in November. Consumer inflation rose to 0.71% in November, accelerating from an all-time low of 0.25% in the prior month, due to rises in the price of vegetables, eggs, meat and fish, spices and fuel. Inflation rose in both urban and rural areas.

Local manufacturing of rate earth magnets. The Ministry of Heavy Industries has reportedly launched a 72.80 billion rupee ($805 million) incentive scheme to promote domestic manufacturing of rare earth permanent magnets, as India looks to reduce its dependence on imports.

Right now, the most recent estimates show that India lost about $250 billion in just 2024 as a result of air pollution … we may not walk the pavement and do as much shopping, people may avoid Delhi, because, from a tourism perspective, [it is] so incredible.

The apprehension investors have surrounding Oracle has spilled over from manifesting in its stock price — which has fallen nearly 50% from its all-time high on Sept. 10 — to affecting its projects.

Asset management firm Blue Owl Capital reportedly pulled out from Oracle's $10 billion data center project over unfavorable debt terms, according to the Financial Times, as concerns about the tech giant's high level of debt mount.

The latest development adds fuel to worries that Oracle could delay the completion of data centers for OpenAI, which were first flagged by Bloomberg on Friday, though the cloud company has denied the report.

Shares of Oracle fell 5.4% Wednesday, putting its month-to-date losses more than 11%. They weighed down related names, such as Broadcom Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. 

As a result, major U.S. indexes fell. The S&P 500 retreated 1.16% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.47%, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.81% in its worst day in nearly a month. 

Despite the recent pullback in artificial intelligence stocks, the Bank of America thinks ""the AI trade may still have room to run into 2026"" — with the important caveat that shares going up does not mean a bubble isn't forming. 

""In our view, such progression validates our thesis that a larger AI bubble continues to build,"" analysts at Bank of America wrote. 

The trouble, as always, is pinpointing the exact moment before the bubble pops — if that's even possible.

Major U.S. indexes fall on AI weakness. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average had their fourth consecutive losing session. The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed flat, but the FTSE 100 gained 0.9% after data showed U.K. inflation cooling more than expected in November.

Blue Owl Capital pulls out from Oracle project. Concerns over the cloud company's debt prompted Blue Owl to back out from funding a $10 billion data center Oracle is building for OpenAI, reported the Financial Times.

Oops, something went wrong

(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin's most entrenched investors are still cashing out — and the pressure is starting to show.

More than two months after the token hit a record high above $126,000, Bitcoin has fallen nearly 30% and is struggling to find support. One reason: long-time holders haven't stopped selling. New blockchain data shows that coins held for years are being divested at some of the fastest rates in recent memory, just as the market's ability to absorb them is fading.

According to a report from K33 Research, the amount of Bitcoin that had remained unmoved for at least two years has declined by 1.6 million coins since early 2023, roughly $140 billion worth. That signals sustained selling by long-term holders.

In 2025 alone, nearly $300 billion worth of Bitcoin that had been dormant for over a year has re-entered circulation. CryptoQuant, a blockchain analytics firm, reported that the past 30 days saw one of the heaviest long-term holder distributions in more than five years.

“The market is experiencing a slow bleed characterized by steady spot selling into thin bid liquidity, creating a grinding decline that's harder to reverse than leverage-driven capitulation events,” said Chris Newhouse, director of research at Ergonia, a firm specializing in decentralized finance. 

For much of the past year, that selling was absorbed by a surge of demand from newly launched exchange-traded funds and crypto investment firms. But that demand has faded. ETF flows have turned negative. Derivatives volumes have dropped. And retail participation has thinned. The same supply is now landing on a weaker market with fewer active buyers.

The pressure has been most acute since Oct. 10, when $19 billion in liquidations were registered following unexpected comments on punitive tariffs by US President Donald Trump. That was the biggest single-day leverage washout ever in crypto's history. Traders have retreated from derivatives markets since the crash with few signs of a rebound in sight.

Some executives view the selling by long-term holders as normal, given that many are sitting on large gains even after the recent selloff.

“When you're up 1,000x to 10,000x, it is natural to see some of that distribution take root,” Hassan Ahmed, head of Coinbase Global Inc.'s Singapore operations, told Bloomberg TV. 

After a brief jump on Wednesday to $90,000, which traders attributed to a raft of liquidations of short positions, Bitcoin quickly resumed its decline. The original cryptocurrency fell back toward the lower end of the trading range seen since the October crash, dropping as much as 2.8% to $85,278. It was trading just below $87,000 at 9:30 a.m. in London on Thursday.

“Unlike prior cycles, these reactivations are not driven by altcoin trading or protocol incentives, but by deep liquidity from US ETFs and treasury demand, enabling OG holders to realize profits at six-digit prices and materially reducing ownership concentration,” K33 Senior Analyst Vetle Lunde said, referencing the abbreviation for “original gangster,” the slang term used by crypto enthusiasts to describe early adopters and investors. The amount seen this year and last “represent the second and third-largest long-term held supply reactivations in Bitcoin's history, surpassed only by 2017.” 

Open interest, the number of outstanding contracts, for both Bitcoin options and perpetual futures, remains well below the levels seen before the October crash, according to data from Coinglass. The decline points to most traders still on the sidelines given such markets make up the majority of trading volumes in crypto. At the same time, the so-called basis trade — a way to profit from pricing discrepancies between spot and futures markets — has turned unprofitable for hedge funds.

However, Lunde said selling from Bitcoin long-time holders may be drawing to a close as the reactivation nears a threshold based on observations of historical onchain flows. 

“Looking ahead, the sell-side pressure from long-term holders appears closer to saturation, with around 20% of BTC supply reactivated over the past two years,” Lunde wrote. “The expectation is for OG selling to subside in 2026, allowing two-year supply to rise as BTC transitions toward net buy-side demand amid deeper institutional integration.”

Crypto:

Bitcoin jumped as much as 4% to $89,430 on Thursday, before erasing the gains. 

Options are showing that Bitcoin is heading into the final weeks of 2025 under intense pressure, with around $23 billion in contracts set to expire next Friday that threaten to amplify already-elevated volatility.

The amount accounts for more than half of all the open interest on Deribit, the largest Bitcoin options venue. The looming buildup shows traders are pricing in continued downside risk in what's become an even more perilous market. Bitcoin saw price swings of over $130 billion within an hour during US trading on Wednesday, triggering a cascade of both long and short liquidations. The broader crypto market has fluctuated around the $3 trillion threshold.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","cryptocurrency"

Financial services firm SoFi Technologies said on Thursday that it will soon offer its own stablecoin, following the company's re-entry into crypto last month.

The stablecoin, dubbed SoFiUSD, will be issued by SoFi Bank, positioning the firm as an infrastructure provider for banks and fintechs, according to a press release.

SoFi described itself as among the first national banks to issue a stablecoin on a public, permissionless blockchain. Last week, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency granted conditional approval for national banking charters to several stablecoin issuers.

SoFi didn't say which networks its stablecoin could ultimately be issued on, but the company told Decrypt that the token will debut first on Ethereum. The plan is to expand the token to multiple blockchains over time to spur global availability, SoFi added.

“We're using the infrastructure we've built over the last decade and applying it to real-world challenges in financial services,” SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said in a statement. “Companies today struggle with slow settlement, fragmented providers, and unverified reserve models.”

SoFi said it would be able to share “an attractive yield” with SoFiUSD holders and partners, while parking cash reserves within its account at the Federal Reserve. For “immediate redemption capability,” SoFi said SoFiUSD is fully backed by cash.

Last month, SoFi began allowing members to purchase cryptocurrencies directly from checking and savings accounts. In total, SoFi said that its clients can now trade 30 different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.

The company said that SoFiUSD will serve a key role in its crypto trading business, but it can also be used by businesses looking for cheaper and faster ways to move funds. SoFi said it plans to use the stablecoin in areas such as remittances and payments.

SoFi said that its stablecoin infrastructure will allow companies to issue white-labeled stablecoins. Before a framework for stablecoins was passed this summer, some onlookers anticipated that regulation could unleash myriad branded stablecoins on the market.

SoFi shares changed hands around $25 on Thursday, according to Yahoo Finance. The company's stock price has soared 75% over the past six months.

In January, Noto declared that SoFi would be “incredibly aggressive” with its crypto offerings as the regulatory picture evolved under President Donald Trump. Prior to that, the company had offered trading for 30 digital assets, but it shuttered that offering in 2023.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin and Ethereum grew volatile on Thursday, whipsawing after a widely watched inflation gauge indicated that consumer prices rose less than expected last month.

The cryptocurrencies respectively popped as high as $89,000 and $2,980 before U.S. markets opened, as delayed data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics edged rate cut hopes higher. However, when the opening bell rang, Bitcoin and Ethereum wavered.

As of this writing, Bitcoin had fallen 1.6% over the past week to $88,399, according to CoinGecko. Ethereum was down 6.8%, at $2,957, over the same period of time. Still, both cryptocurrencies showed slight gains over the past day, rising more than 1% each.

The BLS report showed that consumer prices rose 2.7% in the 12 months through November, with inflation cooling to its slowest annual rate pace since July. Economists had penciled in a 3.1% annual increase for the period, according to Trading Economics.

So-called core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, increased 2.6% year-over-year, cooling to its lowest level since March 2021. Thursday's inflation data was delayed by the government shutdown, which prompted cancellations for October.

Low inflation “leaves the door wide open” for further rate cuts in 2026, but it's likely that expectations of accommodative monetary policy aren't the only factor at play, Zach Pandl, head of research at asset manager Grayscale, told Decrypt.

Bitcoin ETFs Notch $457M Haul, Third-Largest Since October

“In late December, markets are often influenced by technical factors, including tax-related selling, so positive fundamental news may not show through in prices until the turn of the year,” he said.

Pandl added that lower interest rates, which tend to boost demand for riskier assets through cheaper borrowing, and bipartisan progress on a market structure bill for digital assets “could be a potent combination” for Ethereum in the coming quarter.

Earlier this week, President Donald Trump told Decrypt that he's open to nominating Democrats to the SEC and CFTC. In recent weeks, key Senate Democrats have told Decrypt that the bill faces low passage odds without guarantees on Democrats' inclusion in agency rulemaking.

On Thursday, traders penciled in a 26% chance that the Fed lowers its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point at its next meeting, according to CME FedWatch. Following Thursday's CPI surprise, those were up 2% over the past day.

The crypto market has turned red today, with tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP trading lower. The total crypto market value has dropped to about $2.97 trillion, down more than 2% in the last 24 hours, as investors remain cautious.

Even though some positive economic news has come out, traders are still selling risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin is trading near $88,100, down about 2% in the past day. Many investors are locking in profits after Bitcoin's strong run earlier this year. At the same time, there are concerns that if prices fall further, leveraged positions tied to Bitcoin ETFs could face liquidation pressure. 

Ethereum and XRP Follow the Market Lower

Ethereum has fallen to around $2,940, down more than 2% in 24 hours. XRP is also under pressure, trading near $1.90, down about 4% for the day. Solana, Dogecoin, and other major altcoins are also posting losses, showing that selling pressure is widespread.

Rate Cuts Haven't Boosted Crypto Yet

There was positive macro news today:

Normally, lower inflation and rate cuts are seen as good for risk assets like crypto. However, markets often react slowly. Many traders are choosing to wait for clearer signals before jumping back in.

Investors Are Still Being Careful

Despite bullish comments from some analysts who say this news should help crypto move higher, investors remain bearish for now.

Concerns about ETF-related selling, global economic uncertainty, and recent price volatility are keeping buyers on the sidelines. Until confidence improves, crypto prices may continue to move lower or sideways in the short term.

What Happens Next?

For now, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP are moving down mainly because of fear-driven trading and profit-taking, not because of negative long-term fundamentals.

If inflation continues to cool and central banks move closer to easing, many analysts believe crypto could recover. But in the short term, the market appears to be in a wait-and-see mode.

                            This Ethereum Whale Could Get Liquidated Soon | Credit: Veronica Cestari                        

A massive Ethereum whale is under severe pressure as ETH's downtrend deepens.

With losses now exceeding $60 million, traders are watching closely to see whether this position becomes the next forced liquidation event.

As Ethereum slides toward a critical support zone near $2,100, the question is whether this whale will blink.

An insider whale is losing money on  a $600 million long ETH position, with an entry price of $3,167.

The same whale traded with massive size right before the Oct. 10 crash, opening massive shorts.

However, while he had roughly $120 million in profits, those have evaporated with his recent long.

🚨 BREAKING 🚨

Insider Bitcoin whale has added another $35.5 million to his $ETH  long position.

Down more than $60 million in ETH, the whale is also down roughly $8 million in combined Bitcoin and Solana longs.

As of the time of writing, the trader is down to less  than $30 million in profits.

The liquidation price of this Ethereum long is at $2,132, so it remains to be seen if he will get liquidated.

Despite the massive price decrease, analysts on X remain positive about Ethereum's future trend.

Max Crypto showed  that Ethereum has reached its realized price for accumulation addresses, which previously led to trend reversals.

ETH looks much closer to a bottom than to a top now, he stated

Others remain firmly bearish.

XForceGlobal believes that another low is likely.

Income Sharks has a similar sentiment. He uses the OBV to show that the recent breakdown  will lead to new lows.

With that in mind, let's look at Ethereum's technical analysis to determine if the whale is at risk of liquidation.

Ethereum's technical analysis is decisively bearish.

The ETH price began a five-wave downward movement after the all-time high in August.

If the count is accurate, the ETH price has started the fifth and final wave in this decline.

Wave four was contained inside an ascending parallel channel.

Yesterday's breakdown (red icon) confirms that the trend is bearish.

Alongside the price action, the breakdown triggered a bearish signal in the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD).

The indicator made a bearish cross (black circle) and broke down the support trend line.

Hence, the Ethereum price prediction is bearish. The next closest support is at $2,106, 25% below the current price.

If ETH reaches that level, the whale's massive long position would be at serious risk of liquidation.

Ethereum's downtrend is  a high-stakes battle between price and leverage.

With an Ethereum whale already down $60 million and liquidation looming near $2,100, the next move could have outsized consequences for the broader market.

A forced liquidation could accelerate losses, while a sudden bounce might spare the position and spark a relief rally.

For now, all eyes are on whether his whale can withstand the pressure or become the catalyst for the next major move.","{'href': 'https://www.ccn.com', 'title': 'CCN.com'}","cryptocurrency"

Cryptocurrency markets are facing heightened volatility as the Bank of Japan (BOJ) prepares to raise interest rates, a move that could have ripple effects on Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and other digital assets globally.

BOJ Prepares Historic Rate Increase

Japan has maintained ultra-low interest rates for decades to stimulate economic growth through cheap borrowing. However, rising inflation and a weakening yen have prompted the BOJ to signal a rate hike. Economists predict a 0.25% increase from the current 0.5%, potentially reaching 0.75%, the highest level in decades.

The rate increase, although seemingly small, represents a major shift in Japan's monetary policy and is expected to influence both local and global financial markets.

Why Crypto Investors Should Take Notice

Cryptocurrency markets thrive on liquidity, with cheap money fueling investments in high-risk assets. When central banks tighten monetary policy, borrowing costs rise and liquidity dries up. Historically, these conditions trigger sell-offs in speculative markets, including crypto.

Bitcoin often feels the first impact. During the 2022 U.S. Federal Reserve rate hikes, Bitcoin prices plunged from over $60,000 to under $20,000 in a matter of months. Analysts say a similar effect could be seen if the BOJ proceeds with the anticipated hike.

The Role of the Yen and Global Carry Trades

A stronger yen could also impact global carry trades. Investors often borrow yen at low rates to invest in higher-yielding assets such as U.S. stocks or crypto. A rate hike may reverse these trades, creating additional selling pressure in crypto markets.

“This is not isolated to Japan,” said one market analyst. “Japan is the world's third-largest economy, so their moves create ripples.”

Current Market Trends

As of Dec 17, cryptocurrency markets are showing early signs of stress. Bitcoin is trading around $86,589, down over 1% in the past 24 hours. Ethereum has fallen to $2,834, losing more than 4% of its value. XRP is also under pressure, trading at $1.86 with a decline of nearly 4%. The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies stands at $2.92 trillion. 

FAQs

A BOJ rate hike can reduce global liquidity, often pressuring risky assets like crypto as investors shift toward safer, yield-bearing investments.

Yes, tighter monetary policy can increase volatility and selling pressure, especially if global investors reduce exposure to speculative assets.

Not necessarily. Short-term volatility may rise, but long-term crypto trends still depend on adoption, innovation, and global demand.

2026 is closing in. The crypto market is changing with all the institutional interest. Here are 5 altcoins that should do well next year.

The same altcoins kept rising to the top, and the list is nothing like what most investors expect. Some are obvious. Others will surprise you. All these altcoins have key catalysts ahead that could reshape their value. In this video, I walk through each pick. The numbers behind them, and why this mix may outperform the typical 2026 portfolio. If you're willing to challenge assumptions, this is where you start.

My first pick, in this list of altcoins, isn't an altcoin at all. That's right, it's the crypto OG himself, Bitcoin ($BTC). It's your hedge against a crumbling dollar value. 

We can also see that institutional adoption is speeding up. Big institutional investors are increasingly embracing Bitcoin. They are diversifying their portfolios. There are plenty of DATs (Digital Asset Treasuries) out there. These are companies that strategically hold cryptocurrencies on their balance sheet for investment.

This way, Bitcoin receives legitimacy beyond speculation. Michael Saylor and his Strategy are the perfect example for such a DAT. But we also start to see this with other cryptos. Like, Tom Lee's Bitmine with Ethereum.

Major forecasts still point to strong long-term gains. For instance, J.P. Morgan projects that Bitcoin could reach as high as $170,000 by 2026. This underscores continued confidence in $BTC's growth potential relative to traditional assets. So, even with short-term dips, many analysts see further gains. They credit this to increased demand, shrinking supply, and cycle dynamics.

Given this rising institutional interest, my portfolio will for 30% consist of $BTC. The current $BTC price is around $87k. However, keep in mind, once $BTC hits $170k, or higher, it doesn't matter whether you bought it at $85k or $92k. Make sure to buy it!

Ethereum ($ETH) is my next pick of this list for altcoins in 2026. And believe me, for a long time I was not a big Ethereum fan. However, it seems that Buterin is turning things around. The recent Fusaka upgrade can well put Ethereum back on my radar. Yes, I know, it always had that first mover advantage. However, it was too slow and too expensive to do anything on it. At least for my liking. 

This Fusaka upgrade changed a few things. Ethereum became scalable. Transactions are becoming cheaper and faster. To be honest, it's about time! So, check out my recent video about this Fusaka upgrade. It has been a massive move for Ethereum. And if we look at the $ETH price, it's up by almost 8% over the last 14 days. My portfolio will consist of 20% $ETH. Like Bitcoin, institutional interest is also big for Ethereum. Both have plenty of ETFs, with more to come.

Sui Network ($SUI) is one of my fave projects. The Mysten Labs team doesn't seem to know how to stop building. Which is good on them. We have already seen various institutions showing interest in the Sui Network. 21Shares is now offering 2x leveraged SUI ETF (TXXS) on the Nasdaq. Leveraged ETFs are a first for Sui. 

The SEC has approved the first-ever 2x leveraged SUI ETF (TXXS), live on Nasdaq via @21shares_us.

We also know that Sui already offers a wide variety of stablecoins. In June 2026, 3 more European stablecoins will join. These are the MICA-regulated stablecoins $EURXM, $USDXM, and $RONXM. Sui is working hard on the payments front to get the industry on similar functional payment standards with the Blockchain Payments Consortium. It's another sign of how important payments and stablecoins are for Sui's long term growth.

Here's an interesting story about Bhutan. You may know that Bhutan already mined around 13,000 $BTC. That's worth around $1.3 billion. However, it's located in the remote Himalayas. So, Sui successfully tested how blockchain can function without internet.

With the current $SUI price at $1.48. I will reserve the last 20% of my portfolio in 2026 for $SUI.

Bittensor ($TAO) is next up on my altcoins for my 2026 portfolio. The $TAO halving just happened. So, check out my recent video on this event. This is a big event for Bittensor. But, as I explain in that video, Bittensor took inspiration from $BTC, but it's certainly not a copy. The tokenomics are similar, with a 21 million max $TAO cap and halvings. However, mining couldn't be more different. 

Bitcoin mining uses hash power. In contrast, in Bittensor you produce value by performing AI tasks. Miners compete for rankings. Bittensor has subnets. So, the better the output is, the better the subnet's ranking is. This translates to the amount of $TAO they receive. A very different game compared to Bitcoin. 

The current $TAO price is around $254. However, after the halving, I can see the price going up again. And don't underestimate the current AI boom we see. Bittensor is the leading crypto AI project. Chainlink on this list takes care of the infrastructure. However, Bittensor is where it really happens. This is our big AI favorite at Altcoin Buzz. That's why I make sure that 15% of my portfolio is in $TAO.

With Ondo Finance ($ONDO) we're in the RWA sector and last on today's list of altcoins. Now, I've been talking about Ondo and RWA for a long time. RWAs have all the ingredients to become massive. All the big financial players are betting heavily on this. Think of BlackRock and other big players. However, we can add another massive development.

Blockchain was created to challenge the assumptions embedded in decades-old financial infrastructure. 

“The technology itself is sound,” Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships and innovation, Citi Services at Citi, told PYMNTS. “It has operational scale to it.” 

Still, for the bulk of its history, blockchain has existed at the edge of the financial system, promising speed, transparency and efficiency while remaining largely disconnected from the operational core of global banks as it continued to move value outside of mainstream channels.

But in a shift driven less by ideology or innovation theater, and more by a fundamental change in how commerce operates, financial blockchain has begun to move from experiment to infrastructure. Markets, after all, no longer pause for holidays, batch windows or regional banking hours. As a result, banks have adapted their financial services to accommodate this always-on reality. 

Blockchain's adoption, however, is not happening in the way early proponents may have once imagined. Rather than replacing traditional financial infrastructure, blockchain is being folded into it.

Advertisement: Scroll to Continue

“What really excited us,” Chatterjee said, “is the fact that we are able to integrate [blockchain] into our operating model … create a 24/7, always-on, on-demand ecosystem for our clients. But the key word is integration.”

Chatterjee framed Citi's approach around a simple but consequential distinction: blockchain as a technology versus blockchain-native instruments. While public attention often gravitates toward assets like cryptocurrencies or stablecoins, Citi's strategic focus has been more foundational. 

“For us it's about the technology and its benefits, and then the types of instruments,” he said. “We're very focused more on the technology.

“Here is an ecosystem that is natively digital,” Chatterjee said. “You can get and use structured data out of this ecosystem very efficiently.” 

For institutions that spend enormous resources reconciling fragmented information, that shift has implications well beyond payments or settlement. Unlike traditional finance, which still relies heavily on PDFs, emails and manual data extraction, blockchain environments produce standardized, structured digital data by default.

Many of blockchain's benefits center on attributes that traditional financial systems have historically struggled to deliver at scale. Blockchain networks are inherently always on, eliminating reliance on batch processing and rigid cutoff times. They can support decentralized updates to records while maintaining consistency across participants. 

The technology enables a degree of programmability that can enhance both efficiency and oversight, rather than undermining them.

The momentum, and even the rationale, behind global finance's shift toward blockchain can be traced to structural changes in global commerce, many of which accelerated during the pandemic when lockdowns pushed businesses of all sizes toward digital marketplaces and eCommerce platforms that operated continuously and across borders. 

“There were no holidays, there were no weekends,” Chatterjee said. “Nothing stopping you from doing business.” 

At the same time, supply chains and customer bases have become more global over the past five years, increasing the complexity of payments, liquidity and settlement. The growing mismatch between always-on commerce and time-bound financial services has been thrown into stark relief.  

“We could feel our clients' need for the financial services, the banking services, payments, liquidity, everything starting to go 24/7,” Chatterjee said, noting that financial blockchain solutions allow liquidity and payments to move at the same pace as commerce itself.

Instead of asking clients to adapt to a new system, Citi has worked to embed blockchain capabilities behind the scenes, allowing clients to access benefits without changing how they interact with the bank.

“The biggest challenge with blockchain technology is that it remains as this mysterious technology,” Chatterjee said.

Too often, it is viewed as a standalone system that requires specialized teams and wholesale reinvention. In practice, that has not been Citi's experience.

“Blockchain can be integrated into all forms of traditional technology. It can work on scale,” Chatterjee said, pointing to the emergence of common standards and architectures that allow blockchain components to be assembled incrementally. 

“We have allowed our clients to stay on our network and connect to us through their preferred traditional method,” he added, “but we have taken the blockchain technology, kept it in-house, and given the benefit to our clients.”

As attention turns to blockchain-based financial instruments like stablecoins, tokenized deposits and tokenized securities, Citi's priorities again diverge from popular narratives. Rather than betting on a single asset class, the bank is focused on ensuring that different instruments and networks can work together.

“For all of this ecosystem to work, you need interoperability,” Chatterjee said. That includes interoperability between instruments and between networks, as well as secure mechanisms for exchanging information across institutions.

Closely tied to this is wallet infrastructure, which Chatterjee describes as a core component of the system. Wallets are not only where assets are held, but where they are serviced, transferred and returned. As Citi prepares to expand custody services for digital assets, that capability becomes foundational rather than peripheral.

Looking ahead, Chatterjee sees blockchain not as a separate line of business, but as one component of a broader digital transformation that includes data platforms, automation and artificial intelligence.

“We exist to service our clients and to provide a sense of safety, security and control,” he said.  

As clients allocate more capital to tokenized assets or expand into new markets, blockchain capabilities will need to intersect with traditional treasury, payments, custody and trade finance solutions. That approach reflects a broader institutional mindset: Innovation should reduce complexity for clients, not shift it onto them.

The Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) has rolled out the world's first nationwide onchain universal basic income (UBI), distributing dollar-linked digital bonds to citizens through the Stellar blockchain.

The program, locally named ENRA, began in November 2025 and delivers quarterly payments to eligible residents, providing essential financial services across the country's remote and geographically dispersed islands. This initiative coincides with growing institutional activity on Stellar, including pilot projects by major financial players exploring blockchain-based dollar tokenization.

At the heart of the program is USDM1, a fully collateralized, digitally issued sovereign bond developed with support from the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF). SDF issued a multimillion-dollar grant to facilitate USDM1's development and deployment, marking the first large-scale use of blockchain for government welfare.

Citizens can receive their quarterly payments either through traditional banking methods or directly via USDM1 tokens in Lomalo, a mobile app purpose‑built for RMI and powered by Crossmint wallets on Stellar. Payments are executed on the Stellar Disbursement Platform, allowing instant delivery even in the most remote communities.

Denelle Dixon, CEO and Executive Director of SDF, said

“Delivering the first blockchain‑powered instance of nationwide Universal Basic Income is what the Stellar network was built to power. Every day, people can receive and spend money onchain, and get access to basic financial services that they have been shut out of in the traditional financial system.”

Previously, UBI and other government payments relied on cash deliveries via official transport vessels, which were slow, costly, and limited in reach. With USDM1 and Lomalo, citizens in remote atolls can now receive their funds within seconds, bypassing traditional logistical challenges.

The rollout reflects the Marshall Islands' long-standing challenge with financial access and geographic fragmentation. With communities spread across hundreds of islands and limited correspondent banking links, distributing public funds has historically been slow and expensive.

Funding for the UBI program is tied in part to the country's sovereign trust arrangements, including compensation-linked funds connected to historical U.S. nuclear testing. Officials have framed the initiative as a social support mechanism designed to cushion residents against rising living costs and economic vulnerability, rather than as a shift toward a new national currency.

While early reactions highlight the efficiency and auditability of on-chain payments, the government acknowledges ongoing challenges, including digital literacy, smartphone access, and connectivity gaps in remote areas. Still, the Marshall Islands' experiment is being closely watched as a real-world test of whether public blockchains like Stellar can reliably support large-scale government welfare programs.

To many, Magic Eden is known as the leading NFT marketplace on Solana. However, Magic Eden has already evolved beyond a marketplace into a crypto entertainment platform. Let's examine the changes that have shaped this transition.

Magic Eden has shifted from a simple NFT marketplace to a “crypto entertainment platform” by integrating gaming elements.

Features like “Lucky Buy” and “Pack Ripping” focus on user fun, successfully rebranding the platform's image.

The platform allocates 30% of its revenue to buy back $ME tokens and NFTs, creating a strong link with its holders.

🇰🇷 한국어로 읽기 →

Magic Eden, founded in 2021, quickly disrupted the “NFT Marketplace War.” Magic Eden rose as a key player on Solana by offering low fees and creator-friendly tools. To date, Magic Eden has facilitated $15-20 billion in NFT trading volume over the past four years.

However, this strong first impression has led to a low valuation for the project.

This is because many investors still view Magic Eden only as the “top NFT exchange on Solana.” Consequently, fears regarding the broader NFT market lead to fears about Magic Eden itself.

However, Magic Eden moved past being a simple NFT marketplace long ago. It has already built a diverse set of revenue streams.

Jack, the co-founder, stated on X that token trading now accounts for over 30% of total revenue as of 2024. This marks a clear shift from the past when the firm relied solely on NFT fees. The change continues in 2025 as Magic Eden adds gaming features to evolve into an entertainment platform.

The “Packs” feature is a prime example. This is a chance-based mechanic similar to the existing “Lucky Buy” tool. Data proves its success. According to a podcast with Presto Research, “Packs” earned about $15 million in its first week.

Magic Eden is no longer just an NFT marketplace. It is now a “crypto entertainment platform” that focuses on user fun.

Since its start, Magic Eden has pursued bold and fun ideas. Its core target has always been the “Crypto Normie.” This refers to the retail user rather than the pro trader. The mass market seeks intuitive fun instead of complex trading tools.

Most exchanges and token trading tools compete in the “PvP” (Player vs Player) market with low fees and pro-level tools. This is an overcrowded “Red Ocean” with low expected returns. Much of the crypto industry focuses on this segment and chases pro trading trends.

Instead, Magic Eden focuses on “Fun.” While others chase whales, Magic Eden is adopting a “Zig while others zag” strategy to capture the vast consumer market.

The best case of this strategy is “Lucky Buy.” This product was launched in September 2023. Users can try to win high-value NFTs with small commitments via roulette, without paying the full price.

Users can set their probability 1% or as high as 75%, depending on how much they want to pay. But this also sets their chances. This product offers a chance to win for users with less capital and provides additional liquidity to sellers.

Turning the purchase process into a game triggered a huge response. Despite service blocks in the US due to regulations. And with only organic demand, Lucky Buy became Magic Eden's fastest growing product lines .

Launched in late October 2025, “Packs extends this strategy. It brings the thrill of opening physical card packs to the digital realm. Users “rip” digital packs earned from app activity to find rare digital collectibles: from NFTs across top Solana and Ethereum collections to tokenized, graded Pokémon cards.

In the first week of launch, Packs generated around $15 million - more than the entire NFT industry combined, highlighting strong user demand. 

Magic Eden is now doubling down on this product: adding multi-pack ripping, expanding digital collectible categories, and even more novel game mechanics like pack battles, gifting, and richer gameplay effects.

This serves as a strong retention tool. While users on rival platforms analyze complex charts, Magic Eden users find joy in ripping packs. This is the essence of crypto entertainment.

Strategies based on fun and speculation face strict rules. Under the SEC and the Biden administration, the US held a harsh stance on crypto.

Most firms would retreat or cut features in this climate. Magic Eden did not hide. It employs sophisticated “Geo-blocking” to restrict US access technically, and leverages its large global user base to grow. At the same time, operating at the highest standards to comply with all regulations .

Magic Eden  prioritized providing permissionless, experimental products to users in regions outside the US, like Korea.

While others shrink before regulations, Magic Eden confronts them to supply what the public wants. This approach treats regulation not as a passive constraint, but as “Operational Alpha” to boost global market share.

High corporate revenue means little to investors if it does not raise the price of tokens in their wallets. Many crypto projects fail to link platform revenue with token value.

Magic Eden addressed this on November 13, 2025, by announcing a “Buyback Program.” The concept is simple: the firm reinvests profits to support ecosystem value. Magic Eden pledged to return 30% of NFT marketplace revenue through the following structure:

$ME Token Buyback (15% of revenue): The firm buys $ME tokens directly from the market. This mirrors stock buybacks. Reducing circulating supply exerts upward pressure on token value.

NFT Collection Buyback (15% of revenue): The remaining 15% funds the purchase of key NFT collections. These assets are permanently stored in an on-chain vault called “The Garden of Eden.” By directly defending the Floor Price, the firm strengthens the ecosystem.

This program starts on Solana and will expand to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monad, and more. Magic Eden's tokenomics surpass simple governance. Company success directly drives token buying and NFT price support. This systematizes the phrase “Project success equals community success,” delivering what the public truly wants.

Magic Eden is no longer just an NFT marketplace. It is now a crypto entertainment platform give fun to the masses.

Magic Eden first built a solid financial base. Its wallet and swap tools link assets across fragmented chains. It then added features like Lucky Buy and Pack to gain mass users. To sustain this, a buyback program using 30% of revenue provides clear economic rewards.

The edge for Magic Eden lies in speed and market insight. While peers stall due to rules or complex tech, Magic Eden delivers the engagement and “dopamine” users crave. It used bold geo-blocking to move fast while others paused.

But still large gaps remain in the crypto entertainment space. High-value sectors like prediction markets offer multi-billion dollar growth that is largely untapped. Magic Eden seeks to lead this shift and capture this value. To this end, it is now incubating independent arms such as Dicey, an iGaming platform. These new ventures will drive the next phase of growth.

The final step is to fit these tools into a mobile wallet. When finance and fun meet in one app, Magic Eden will serve as the main gateway to the Web3 world.

About us

Copy link

After more than four years of continuous development, the Octra ICO marks the public distribution phase of a network built to support protocol-level encrypted computation. Since 2021, Octra has focused on developing a general-purpose encrypted compute network utilizing a proprietary fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme, which enables network nodes to perform computations on encrypted data without accessing the plaintext. Octra describes its approach as integrating encrypted state and execution directly into its core architecture.

Octra is preparing to conduct a public token sale from December 18 to December 25, 2025. The sale will be hosted on Sonar, a token issuance platform operated by Echo.

The public sale will offer 10% of the total OCT token supply at a fixed price of $0.20 per token, implying a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $200 million if fully subscribed, with a total fundraising cap of $20 million.

All tokens purchased in the ICO are expected to be fully unlocked at distribution, a design choice that contrasts with more recent token sales that commonly include vesting schedules or lockups. While this structure enhances liquidity and transparency, it may also introduce short-term market dynamics that participants should evaluate accordingly.

Octra positions itself as a general-purpose, privacy-centric Layer-1 blockchain designed to support computation on encrypted data. At the core of the protocol is fully homomorphic encryption, a cryptographic technique that allows mathematical operations to be performed directly on encrypted inputs without first decrypting them. In theory, this enables applications to process sensitive data such as financial information, proprietary logic, or user activity, without exposing that data to validators, nodes, or the broader public ledger.

Octra's design embeds confidentiality at the base layer. The stated objective is to allow developers to build privacy-preserving smart contracts and workflows without relying on external privacy layers or complex cryptographic abstractions.

Octra's differentiation hinges on its attempt to make encrypted computation a first-class primitive, rather than an optional add-on.

Octra has raised approximately $8 million across early funding rounds since 2024, including a $4 million pre-seed round led by Finality Capital Partners.

These earlier rounds funded initial protocol development, internal testing, and ecosystem preparation. Unlike private placements that typically limit participation to institutional or accredited investors, the upcoming ICO is structured to broaden access and distribute ownership across a wider set of participants.

Based on publicly available information, Octra's token allocation is structured as follows:

OCT Token Supply Allocation. Source: Octra. 

Octra has stated that no single investor controls more than 3% of the total token supply, a distribution profile intended to limit concentration risk and promote decentralized ownership.

Participation in the ICO requires registration through Octra's official sale portal and the creation of a verified Sonar account. Prospective participants must complete standard KYC and eligibility checks, including residence verification and sanctions screening. Registration alone does not guarantee participation, as final eligibility remains subject to compliance requirements.

As with any early-stage public token sale, participation in the Octra ICO carries material risk. Fully homomorphic encryption, while academically mature, remains computationally intensive and largely unproven at scale in production blockchain environments. Execution risk, developer adoption, and competitive differentiation will be critical to long-term outcomes.

Additional considerations include regulatory uncertainty surrounding token sales, evolving global compliance frameworks, and the historically volatile trading behavior associated with immediately unlocked tokens. Market participants should evaluate the ICO within the broader context of their risk tolerance and investment objectives.","{'href': 'https://www.dlnews.com', 'title': 'dlnews.com'}","cryptocurrency"

International Investigations Editor


	The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has launched an investigation into a major data breach that affected thousands of film and TV workers.


Deadline revealed in October that members of the Bectu union had personal details breached in a cyber attack on Prospect, Bectu's parent union.


	Member information accessed included bank details, contact details, and “personal identifiers” like birth dates and protected characteristics. Prospect apologized for the incident.


	It was not clear how many people were impacted, but sources said that it was likely to be the majority of Bectu's 40,000 members.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The ICO will work with counterparts in Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man to investigate the scope of data exposed, whether Prospect had adequate cybersecurity protections in place, and if the union informed authorities about the breach properly.


	John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner, said: “When people share their most sensitive information with an organisation, they do so with the expectation that it will be handled responsibly and securely. 


	“We will be scrutinising the cyber incident at Prospect to check whether those expectations were met. This joint investigation demonstrates our determination to work more closely with our international counterparts to ensure that data protection standards are upheld across all jurisdictions.”


	Prospect general secretary Mike Clancy wrote to staff on Thursday to inform them of the ICO investigation (email below).


	In a statement, the union said: “In June 2025 the union experienced a cybersecurity incident affecting our servers. We took immediate action to secure our systems and were able to prevent any impact on the services we provide to members.


	“The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has today confirmed that it is investigating the incident. As the announcement notes, the opening of this investigation should not be taken to mean that the ICO has reached a conclusion that Prospect has infringed data protection law.

	











	“In line with our obligations Prospect informed the ICO soon after the incident took place. Our full investigation report has been shared with regulatory bodies including the police and the ICO, and we have updated the ICO throughout the incident. We will continue to co-operate fully with their investigation as it continues.


	“The union's National Executive Committee has also commissioned its own independent review into the incident and will keep members updated as that progresses. 


	“We take our responsibilities to our members incredibly seriously and are deeply sorry for any impact on them. These kinds of incidents are sadly becoming more common, and we encourage members to utilise the support we have offered if they have not yet done so.”

Dear colleagueI am writing to make you aware that the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has decided to announce publicly that they are investigating the cyber incident that took place earlier in the year.Last year the ICO completed 179 investigations and in general they do not make announcements until the investigation has reached some conclusions. We believe they have decided to make an announcement in our case because the investigation will also cover the separate jurisdictions of the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey, with the ICO acting as lead regulator.In line with our obligations Prospect informed the ICO soon after the incident took place. Our full investigation report has been shared with regulatory bodies including the police and the ICO. We have also updated the ICO throughout the incident.Our response to the media is provided below. The important point for any members concerned is that the Experian Credit monitoring remains available to sign up to until the end of the year and will then run for a year from that point, so if they have not signed up for this yet we would still urge them to do so.This situation is fluid and we will do our best to keep you informed. Please reach out to [redacted] if you have any questions.RegardsMike

Jeff Alvares is senior counsel at the Central Bank of Brazil, leading legal and policy work on financial regulation, fintech, and payments. He previously served at the Financial Stability Board, directing the G20 Cross-Border Payments Roadmap. With nearly two decades in financial law and policy, he helped design regulatory frameworks at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. A graduate of Harvard Law School and University of São Paulo, he writes at jeffalvares.com.

Countries representing 98% of global GDP are exploring central bank digital currencies. They must devise digital infrastructure to maximize competition, writes Jeff Alvares.

Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are poised to become the next frontier of digital protectionism. As central banks from the Bahamas to China replace paper money with code, the global monetary system faces a profound transformation. Until recently, 137 economies accounting for 98% of global GDP were exploring central bank digital currencies. While the United States has paused its retail CBDC efforts in favor of private stablecoins, the rest of the world is moving ahead, motivated by financial inclusion, regulatory oversight, and a more multipolar monetary system.

The technology behind CBDCs introduces new possibilities by integrating layers that traditional banking keeps separate: currency issuance, settlement infrastructure, payment schemes, and applications (like digital wallets). As nations rush from pilot to launch, they risk using this integration to blur the line between legitimate monetary sovereignty and protectionist monopolization of digital services. A critical question emerges: Where does legitimate monetary sovereignty end, and where do trade‑restrictive digital market policies begin? The answer hinges on the crucial distinction between controlling money itself and controlling the competitive markets that form around it.

This question is not abstract. In July 2025, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative launched a Section 301 investigation into Brazil's Pix instant payment system over alleged restrictive policies advantaging the payment system under public control. The investigation echoed earlier World Trade Organization disputes such as the 2012 case of China's Electronic Payment Services, which likewise addressed state control of payment markets. While Pix is a payment system rather than a currency, the investigation signals a new battleground in global commerce over government‑provided digital infrastructures. As currencies that require dedicated digital payment infrastructures, CBDCs share many architectural elements with payment systems while displaying features that render them even more vulnerable to trade scrutiny.

In earlier analyses of Pix (Part I and Part II), I examined how the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) balances WTO members' rights to provide public services against commitments to allow foreign firms into the electronic payment services market. The framework turns on the governmental‑authority exception to market access: the principle that the government may monopolize essential infrastructure that naturally precludes multiple competitors while user‑facing services should remain competitive. The exceptions also test to determine whether monopolizing markets adjacent to the essential infrastructure is necessary to achieve public‑policy goals or if alternatives that are less trade‑restrictive are reasonably available.

Understanding how CBDCs fit into the GATS framework requires recognizing the industrial organization of payment systems and what makes CBDCs distinct.

The architecture of payment systems

Traditional payment systems operate on a four‑layer stack that enables competition across multiple levels. First is money: the underlying medium of exchange existing as central bank reserves, cash, and bank deposits. Second is settlement infrastructure: systems enabling transfer of money between financial institutions, such as Brazil's Instant Payment System (SPI), India's Immediate Payment Services (IMPS), or the U.S.' FedNow. Third are payment schemes: rules, standards, and brands governing how end users access the infrastructure, such as Pix, India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI), Visa, and Mastercard. Fourth are applications: software interfaces and added services implementing these schemes, such as banking apps, fintech platforms, and digital wallets.

This layered framework allows competition where it is feasible, usually at the third and fourth layers closer to ordinary consumers, while preserving central‑bank control where it is necessary (the first layer and, usually, the second). Pix is instructive in its expansiveness. As a construct for transferring Brazilian reais, it comprises the SPI settlement infrastructure, the Pix scheme, and bank and fintech applications for making and receiving money transfers. It monopolizes de facto the infrastructure and the scheme.

Brazil made the controversial choice to legally fuse the infrastructure and scheme layers. First, it mandated that the SPI infrastructure be built exclusively for Pix, barring alternative payment schemes from using these public rails. Second, it required large banks and payment service providers to connect to this closed infrastructure. Third, it compelled those institutions to offer the Pix scheme to customers at zero pricing. While these choices created a unified national network almost instantly, they also foreclosed competition. The monopoly on the rails became a monopoly on the rules, with limited rivalry for applications and clear implications for trade commitments.

India's UPI demonstrates an alternative model. UPI achieves comparable dominance, powering 85% of India's digital transactions and serving nearly 500 million users, through openness on three of the four layers. IMPS, the underlying settlement system, is a public utility that any licensed entity can access and that supports alternative schemes for large transfers and business payments. Participation in IMPS and UPI is entirely voluntary, driven by consumer demand rather than regulatory fiat. At the application layer, banks, domestic fintechs, and global platforms all offer UPI‑based apps, competing vigorously on features and services.

UPI proves that achieving universal financial inclusion does not require legislating monopoly at all four levels. Superior user experience, strong network effects, and zero pricing can drive voluntary, market‑led adoption. This openness establishes a critical precedent for trade law: when a state intervenes in digital finance, it must justify any restriction beyond the minimal necessary infrastructure. Brazil's legal restrictions on Pix were deliberate policy choices, not technological inevitabilities.

How CBDCs differ from traditional payment systems

CBDCs disrupt the traditional payment‑system stack because they merge the first two layers. A CBDC is not infrastructure for moving pre‑existing money; it is the money itself.

There are two types of CBDCs. Account‑based CBDCs, which most major economies are exploring, including China and the Eurosystem, exist as balances in a central bank ledger. These digital balances are created by verifying user identity—the principle of “I am, therefore I own.” The system for recording and transferring ownership is not a service for the money but constitutive of it. The currency cannot be separated from the account system that verifies its existence.

For token‑based CBDCs—portable digital units with cryptographic properties potentially based on distributed ledger technology, such as the Bahamas' sand dollar—the fusion is similar. These tokens are created by authenticating the digital object itself—the principle of “I know, therefore I own.” The protocols governing creation, validation, and transfer are constitutive of the money itself. Tokens may allow greater wallet‑level separability, but the underlying protocol defining what they are remains inseparable from the money.

The key practical difference: account-based CBDCs prioritize identity verification and regulatory oversight—the system always knows who holds what—making them well-suited for anti-money laundering compliance but requiring robust privacy protections. Token-based CBDCs prioritize portability and potential anonymity—tokens can transfer peer-to-peer like physical cash—but make regulatory oversight more challenging.

In both models, the infrastructure defines the money's existence and legitimacy. This collapse of the money‑infrastructure divide matters profoundly for trade law. Under international law, states have an unquestioned exclusive right to issue legal tender (money, at layer one). A monopoly on the foundational infrastructure of a CBDC—the core ledger and settlement engine (layer two)—is thus an extension of monetary sovereignty, residing outside the reach of trade agreements.

The danger lies in how countries extend this natural monopoly up the stack to layers three and four. While central‑bank control of wholesale CBDC infrastructure is inherent in monetary sovereignty, it does not require controlling the scheme (layer three) or application (layer four). While some early designs keep these layers separate, many are conflating them, using “sovereignty” as a shield for market foreclosure.

Distribution models and the three policy questions

There are two CBDC systems available to national governments. Intermediated systems can keep layers three and four open markets to competition, while direct systems inherently foreclose them.

Intermediated retail CBDCs use a two-tier structure: the central bank issues CBDC to financial or payment institutions, which then provide accounts or tokens to the public. China's e-CNY and the European Central Bank's (ECB) digital euro follow this architecture. Countries choose intermediated models not only to avoid overwhelming the central bank with retail operations, but also to leverage existing financial institutions, preserve their role in credit intermediation, and—crucially—enable the possibility of competition at the scheme and application layers.

In intermediated systems, the three-layer separation becomes architecturally feasible. The wholesale CBDC infrastructure could, in principle, support multiple retail schemes, much as India's IMPS supports UPI and alternative frameworks for business payments. This means that even if the infrastructure is a sovereign monopoly, extending that monopoly upward into the scheme layer is a policy choice, not a technological inevitability.

Direct retail CBDCs collapse infrastructure, scheme, and application into one layer, with the central bank itself providing accounts and tokens to the public. Because the central bank itself operates the ledger, designs the rules, and delivers the user interface, application-layer competition is not architecturally feasible. Small jurisdictions such as the Bahamas and Jamaica have adopted this model.

These small island economies lack both the domestic financial institutions to serve as intermediaries and the market size to attract competing foreign payment providers. With populations under 400,000 (Bahamas) and 3 million (Jamaica), the economics of operating competing payment applications don't work: fixed costs of compliance, technology, and support can't be spread across enough users. The central bank stepping in directly solves a genuine market failure rather than foreclosing a competitive market that would otherwise exist.

For direct CBDCs, the trade-law question is whether this full integration is genuinely necessary for the country's circumstances, or whether an intermediated design could have achieved the same policy goals—financial inclusion, monetary control, anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) robustness—while preserving competitive space. Direct models are inherently more exposed to application-layer scrutiny because they perform functions that in conventional payment markets are commercial services subject to GATS disciplines.

Against this backdrop, countries face three distinct policy decisions, each with its own trade-law implications.

1. Infrastructure closure. Operating the wholesale CBDC ledger is a sovereign act beyond trade commitments. But if that infrastructure could support multiple schemes, restricting it to one official scheme demands evidence of genuine necessity and lack of viable alternatives, not mere convenience or industrial policy.

2. Mandatory scheme participation. Even with open infrastructure, forcing intermediaries to offer the official scheme restricts competition. UPI's success illustrates that universal adoption can emerge from voluntary participation when the scheme offers superior functionality.

3. Application-layer restrictions. Even where scheme rivalry is limited, wallet-level competition remains possible. Limiting which apps may implement the CBDC scheme, excluding third-party providers, or imposing discriminatory licensing rules would foreclose competition that could otherwise occur. Such restrictions require evidence of genuine necessity.

The analytical test is simple: Does a restriction pertain to the sovereign monetary infrastructure, the rules of a scheme where alternatives are feasible, or the applications where competition is presumptively viable? Each layer demands a distinct and proportionate justification.

When restrictions might be justified

Countries defending more integrated CBDC models typically advance three lines of justification rooted in national context. Evaluating these claims is essential to distinguishing genuine public policy from disguised protectionism.

Technical necessity may justify single‑scheme architectures if managing monetary policy transmission, financial stability, and AML/CFT compliance across multiple schemes creates genuine systemic risks. But claims of necessity must show why regulatory oversight is insufficient. India's IMPS demonstrates that strong supervision can preserve stability without requiring scheme monopoly.

China's e-CNY illustrates how these arguments play out in practice. The People's Bank of China has cited technical necessity for centralized scheme control, arguing that monetary policy transmission and financial stability monitoring require unified oversight of the CBDC scheme. Whether these justifications meet the necessity test remains an open question. But notably, even with centralized scheme control, China has integrated e-CNY with applications like Alipay and WeChat Pay. This demonstrates that scheme-level restrictions, whatever their merit, need not extend to application-layer foreclosure.

Institutional context can also matter. Countries with concentrated banking markets, limited supervisory capacity, or weaker rule of law may argue that they lack the regulatory infrastructure to oversee scheme or application‑level competition. But institutional weakness cannot become a permanent industrial policy by another name. Temporary flexibility should include sunset clauses, require capacity-building programs, and establish clear evolution benchmarks.

Nigeria's eNaira provides a cautionary example of institutional constraints. Launched in 2021, it struggled with adoption partly because limited regulatory capacity made it difficult to supervise competing private-sector providers effectively, leading authorities to favor a highly centralized direct model. However, three years later, adoption remains under 0.5% of the population, suggesting that institutional weakness used to justify restrictions may create other problems if those restrictions prevent the innovation needed for user acceptance.

Concerns about data governance and financial stability may justify targeted restrictions. But these objectives can often be met through regulation—privacy rules, flow controls, holding limits—rather than foreclosure. Where restrictions are truly necessary, they should be proportionate and time‑limited.

The ECB's digital euro design process illustrates these trade-offs in practice. On data governance, the ECB has debated whether to restrict transaction data access to regulated intermediaries (more privacy-protective) or permit broader access to competing service providers (more competitive but raising surveillance concerns). On financial stability, proposals include holding limits to prevent excessive flows from bank deposits to digital euros, which could destabilize credit intermediation. In both cases, the challenge is achieving policy objectives through targeted regulation rather than using these concerns to foreclose private-sector participation entirely.

Geopolitical stakes and the path forward

The geopolitical stakes are significant. A global contest is unfolding over the template for sovereign digital money. At 14.2 trillion yuan ($2 trillion) China's e‑CNY has reached operational scale quickly, while the ECB's digital euro debates privacy, intermediaries, and data governance with implications that will reverberate globally. By retreating from retail CBDCs in favor of private stablecoins, the U.S. has left a standard‑setting vacuum, one that China and Europe are moving quickly to fill.

For developing countries, the dilemma is acute. The need for digital financial transformation is urgent, but restrictive architectures risk becoming “too‑big‑to‑reform” as millions of users and billions in transactions lock in users and the economy to CBDC systems. Legal clarity must come before launch. Waiting for a WTO dispute may make reform economically or politically impossible.

A new international consensus is urgently needed. The Bank for International Settlements, International Monetary Fund, and WTO should jointly issue guidance establishing clear principles: that wholesale CBDC infrastructure is a matter of monetary sovereignty; that for intermediated models, retail infrastructure should presumptively be open to multiple schemes; that application‑layer competition should be protected; and that deviations must be temporary, transparent, and grounded in evidence‑based necessity.

Together with technical assistance, such clarity would offer a roadmap for central banks, legal certainty for private innovators, and a guardrail against digital protectionism.

The path forward is not state money versus markets, but a synthesis: sovereign digital currency as a secure foundation, with open competition driving innovation above it. UPI shows that public infrastructure and private innovation can be powerful complements. CBDCs present the same opportunity on a broader and more consequential scale. We must seize it by crafting rules that respect sovereignty while championing openness.

Opinion

Comment

December 18, 2025

Central banks across the world – including those of the Arabian Gulf countries – are considering launching digital currencies. America's tumultuous monetary history provides many useful lessons for central bankers as the transition away from paper money accelerates. One of the most important is that while unregulated digital currency is unstable, regulated digital money is prone to political capture.

For more than a century, Americans lived without a central bank. During the 1800s, money was issued by thousands of competing financial institutions and more or less anyone was free to throw their monetary hat into the ring, constituting a banking analogue to the Wild West. 

Counterintuitively to those who have grown up in the era of strong central banks, this system somehow worked, though it certainly sputtered on more than one occasion. As we debate digital currencies today – centralised digital currencies versus decentralised crypto – we are replaying a very old argument.

To be more precise, prior to the establishment of the Federal Reserve, the nascent American nation's federal nature meant that there was no national monetary authority. Anyone could issue currency, and the value associated with those notes stemmed from the trust that people had in the issuing institution.

Critically, competition played a decisive role in the system's success: every bank was strongly motivated to manage its currency in a disciplined manner or people would switch to a competitor, turning its existing money into worthless pieces of paper.

As a result, the overall price level was very stable, with the creeping inflation that we have become accustomed to in the 21st century being largely absent. However, what the system gained in terms of price stability came at the cost of volatility, as financial crises and bank runs were frequent occurrences.

By the end of the 1907 Bankers' Panic, many had had enough, and a centralised, overseeing monetary authority was established. Ostensibly, the goal was to protect ordinary citizens from the tumult of a reckless and rudderless financial system. Yet beneath the technocratic veneer lay a more sinister agenda reflecting elites' insatiable appetite for control, especially those from Wall Street and Capitol Hill. 

While the Federal Reserve has since had the occasional wobble, its iron grip on the monetary system – reflected in its monopoly status as an issuer of American paper currency – has remained intact since its establishment in the early 20th century.

Many libertarians have lamented this permanent erasure of competition and consider it to be the primary reason for the large, accumulated price inflation experienced during the past 12 decades. After all, in the absence of competitive pressure, even the most disciplined central bank will struggle to resist the urge to print money, thereby inadvertently deflating the value of ordinary people's savings. 

One of the most famous examples of politically motivated monetary mismanagement occurred in the early 1970s when president Richard Nixon pressured Federal Reserve chairman Arthur Burns to keep interest rates artificially low in the lead up to the 1972 presidential election. Such a manoeuvre would never have worked in the free banking era.

Exasperation with the politicisation of monetary decisions – along with a desire to be able to transact with a high degree of privacy – have underwritten the growing attractiveness of cryptocurrencies. Today, many central banks are frustrated that their carefully fashioned currency monopolies have been challenged by the disruptive upstarts of the crypto world. 

The instability caused by crises such as the 2022 collapse of the FTX crypto exchange have provided monetary authorities with the political ammunition needed to promote their own digital currencies. Some of those choosing to take a chance on crypto have experienced catastrophic losses that would be unthinkable when trading regular currencies. Governments inside and outside the region have been keen to bolster this argument with appeals to national security, as crypto has emerged as a favoured instrument for drug cartels and terrorists seeking to avoid detection.

Though centralisation solves salient problems like these, it creates risks that we only discover later. Ordinary people must ask themselves: who controls monetary data? Can accounts be frozen arbitrarily or capriciously? And ultimately, are we building resilience in place of the volatility of cryptocurrencies, or are we engineering dependence and monopoly power that is unlikely to be relinquished?

The 19th-century US taught us that decentralised money can be unstable. The 20th century taught us that centralised money can be politically captured. As we enter the age of digital currency, and citizens and policymakers alike toy with the idea of a central bank digital currency, the real challenge is not choosing sides, but rather avoiding the worst of both worlds. The future of money should be secure, but not obedient. This sentiment is captured by a Dutch proverb: “Trust arrives on foot but leaves on horseback.”

The verdict from the nutritionists is damning. But does a cheesecake frappuccino taste good enough to merit the indulgence?

My advice is to only go there if you have unusually sweet tooth. I like my puddings, but this was a bit much even for me. The first hit is a winner, but it's downhill, slowly, from there. Each sip is a little less satisfying than the last, and maybe it was just all that sugar, but it isn't long before the rush is replaced by a creeping remorse. And half of the thing is still left.

The caramel version is far superior to the blueberry, too. If someone put a full caramel cheesecake through a liquidiser and scooped out the contents, it would probably taste something like this. Blueberry, on the other hand, has more of an artificial taste. It's like someone has tried to invent this drink in a lab, and while early results were promising, they're still in the testing phase. It isn't terrible, but something isn't quite right either.

So if you want an experience, go for a small, and opt for the caramel. But if you want a cheesecake, it's probably more satisfying, and not quite as unhealthy, to just order the real thing.

A comparison of sending Dh20,000 from the UAE using two different routes at the same time - the first direct from a UAE bank to a bank in Germany, and the second from the same UAE bank via an online platform to Germany - found key differences in cost and speed. The transfers were both initiated on January 30.

The UAE bank charged Dh152.25 for the Dh20,000 transfer. On top of that, their exchange rate margin added a difference of around Dh415, compared with the mid-market rate.

Total cost: Dh567.25 - around 2.9 per cent of the total amount

Total received: €4,670.30 

The UAE bank's charge for sending Dh20,000 to a UK dirham-denominated account was Dh2.10. The exchange rate margin cost was Dh60, plus a Dh12 fee.

Total cost: Dh74.10, around 0.4 per cent of the transaction

Total received: €4,756

The UAE bank transfer was far quicker – around two to three working days, while the online platform took around four to five days, but was considerably cheaper. In the online platform transfer, the funds were also exposed to currency risk during the period it took for them to arrive.

According to statements reported by Russian news agencies, Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, said cryptocurrencies “will never become money” in Russia and should be treated only as investment instruments. He said that where a payment is required, it must be made in Russian rubles.

Ruble Remains Sole Payment Unit

Based on reports, that stance matches existing law. A 2020 federal law on digital financial assets defines digital currency as something different from Russia's monetary unit and bars its use as a means of payment inside the country. The law treats tokens and classic cryptocurrencies as property or investment items rather than legal tender.

Russia Central Bank Concerns Over Stability

Officials in Moscow have repeatedly echoed the central bank's worry that allowing crypto for everyday payments could harm monetary control and financial stability. Regulators say the ruble's role must be protected, and that volatility in assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum makes them unsuitable for regular transactions. Limited Windows For Crypto Use 

Reports have also noted that while crypto cannot be used to buy goods and services domestically, it can still exist in regulated pockets. Lawmakers and regulators are framing cryptocurrencies as tradable assets, not cash.

Some narrow exceptions are being discussed for corporate or cross-border operations under strict rules, but those do not change the basic ban on domestic payments. What The Law Means For People And Business 

Practical effects are clear. Russian residents and businesses cannot accept digital coins in place of rubles for sales or services. At the same time, individuals can hold, trade, or invest in crypto under the framework that separates ownership from payment rights. The law also requires public officials to declare holdings in digital assets, linking transparency rules to the new regime.A Narrowing Path Forward 

Based on reports from several outlets, the political message is firm: payments stay in rubles. Lawmakers are talking about refining rules for trading, custody and reporting, but they are not signalling a shift toward letting cryptocurrencies replace the ruble for daily use. That position keeps Russia on a different track from some countries that permit crypto payments or give coins legal tender status.

PR Newswire

SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 18, 2025

SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- B5G6G DIGITAL CURRENCY Co., Ltd., led by CEO Sang-Yong Kim, announced plans to issue the SOiVA Deepfake Prevention Stablecoin with a total value equivalent to KRW 750 trillion, along with the launch of the SOiVA Global Digital Asset Governance Economy Service Card.

 

The SOiVA Deepfake Prevention Stablecoin is related to the Korean government's initiative to select private fintech companies to issue a won-denominated stablecoin. However, the project is fundamentally designed as a global business based on a U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin.

This initiative represents the world's first effort to enable the exchange between a U.S. dollar stablecoin and a Korean won stablecoin, to be implemented through the SOiVA Deepfake Prevention Stablecoin issuance project.

The SOiVA Deepfake Prevention Stablecoin issuance project is a privately led, asset-backed digital stablecoin initiative based on natural mineral resources with significant economic value, including rare earth elements.

Through this approach, the SOiVA Deepfake Prevention Stablecoin project aims to lead a new digital distribution network built on physical digital asset–based killer content, create a large-scale global governance digital economy, and drive AI-powered internet convergence services for deepfake prevention.

According to CEO Kim, the SOiVA Deepfake Prevention Stablecoin will be integrated with natural mineral resources from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. After being tokenized as a won-denominated SOiVA digital asset, it will be distributed and traded internationally as a U.S. dollar–based stablecoin.

In digital asset trading, a comprehensive system capable of data generation, distribution, and monitoring is essential, and such a system must also perform global data quality management and evaluation. The SOiVA Deepfake Prevention Stablecoin service system satisfies all of these requirements, positioning it to lead the next generation of global cryptocurrency and stablecoin markets.

The SOiVA Deepfake Prevention Stablecoin service system complies with stablecoin-related regulations in both Korea and the United States and is designed to securely operate all processes—including issuance, circulation, and monitoring—independently in the global market.

CEO Kim further stated that, in addition to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the company has received requests from multiple countries to issue stablecoins on their behalf and is currently pursuing joint projects on a country-by-country basis.

While some advanced countries select domestic private companies to issue their own national stablecoins, an increasing number of countries are granting SOiVA Deepfake Prevention Stablecoin services exclusive rights to issue national stablecoins and are choosing to participate in the SOiVA Global Digital Asset Governance Economy from the outset. This trend is considered highly significant.

These countries are actively working to digitize assets across areas such as travel, labor, culture, politics, economy, society, religion, technology, ESG, and AI. By participating in the SOiVA Global Digital Asset Governance Economy, they are also attracting SOiVA Deepfake Prevention AI Internet Banks to support the implementation of this global digital asset governance initiative within their countries.

Countries representing 98% of global GDP are exploring central bank digital currencies. They must devise digital infrastructure to maximize competition, writes Jeff Alvares.

Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are poised to become the next frontier of digital protectionism. As central banks from the Bahamas to China replace paper money with code, the global monetary system faces a profound transformation. Until recently, 137 economies accounting for 98% of global GDP were exploring central bank digital currencies. While the United States has paused its retail CBDC efforts in favor of private stablecoins, the rest of the world is moving ahead, motivated by financial inclusion, regulatory oversight, and a more multipolar monetary system.

The technology behind CBDCs introduces new possibilities by integrating layers that traditional banking keeps separate: currency issuance, settlement infrastructure, payment schemes, and applications (like digital wallets). As nations rush from pilot to launch, they risk using this integration to blur the line between legitimate monetary sovereignty and protectionist monopolization of digital services. A critical question emerges: Where does legitimate monetary sovereignty end, and where do trade‑restrictive digital market policies begin? The answer hinges on the crucial distinction between controlling money itself and controlling the competitive markets that form around it.

This question is not abstract. In July 2025, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative launched a Section 301 investigation into Brazil's Pix instant payment system over alleged restrictive policies advantaging the payment system under public control. The investigation echoed earlier World Trade Organization disputes such as the 2012 case of China's Electronic Payment Services, which likewise addressed state control of payment markets. While Pix is a payment system rather than a currency, the investigation signals a new battleground in global commerce over government‑provided digital infrastructures. As currencies that require dedicated digital payment infrastructures, CBDCs share many architectural elements with payment systems while displaying features that render them even more vulnerable to trade scrutiny.

In earlier analyses of Pix (Part I and Part II), I examined how the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) balances WTO members' rights to provide public services against commitments to allow foreign firms into the electronic payment services market. The framework turns on the governmental‑authority exception to market access: the principle that the government may monopolize essential infrastructure that naturally precludes multiple competitors while user‑facing services should remain competitive. The exceptions also test to determine whether monopolizing markets adjacent to the essential infrastructure is necessary to achieve public‑policy goals or if alternatives that are less trade‑restrictive are reasonably available.

Understanding how CBDCs fit into the GATS framework requires recognizing the industrial organization of payment systems and what makes CBDCs distinct.

The architecture of payment systems

Traditional payment systems operate on a four‑layer stack that enables competition across multiple levels. First is money: the underlying medium of exchange existing as central bank reserves, cash, and bank deposits. Second is settlement infrastructure: systems enabling transfer of money between financial institutions, such as Brazil's Instant Payment System (SPI), India's Immediate Payment Services (IMPS), or the U.S.' FedNow. Third are payment schemes: rules, standards, and brands governing how end users access the infrastructure, such as Pix, India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI), Visa, and Mastercard. Fourth are applications: software interfaces and added services implementing these schemes, such as banking apps, fintech platforms, and digital wallets.

This layered framework allows competition where it is feasible, usually at the third and fourth layers closer to ordinary consumers, while preserving central‑bank control where it is necessary (the first layer and, usually, the second). Pix is instructive in its expansiveness. As a construct for transferring Brazilian reais, it comprises the SPI settlement infrastructure, the Pix scheme, and bank and fintech applications for making and receiving money transfers. It monopolizes de facto the infrastructure and the scheme.

Brazil made the controversial choice to legally fuse the infrastructure and scheme layers. First, it mandated that the SPI infrastructure be built exclusively for Pix, barring alternative payment schemes from using these public rails. Second, it required large banks and payment service providers to connect to this closed infrastructure. Third, it compelled those institutions to offer the Pix scheme to customers at zero pricing. While these choices created a unified national network almost instantly, they also foreclosed competition. The monopoly on the rails became a monopoly on the rules, with limited rivalry for applications and clear implications for trade commitments.

India's UPI demonstrates an alternative model. UPI achieves comparable dominance, powering 85% of India's digital transactions and serving nearly 500 million users, through openness on three of the four layers. IMPS, the underlying settlement system, is a public utility that any licensed entity can access and that supports alternative schemes for large transfers and business payments. Participation in IMPS and UPI is entirely voluntary, driven by consumer demand rather than regulatory fiat. At the application layer, banks, domestic fintechs, and global platforms all offer UPI‑based apps, competing vigorously on features and services.

UPI proves that achieving universal financial inclusion does not require legislating monopoly at all four levels. Superior user experience, strong network effects, and zero pricing can drive voluntary, market‑led adoption. This openness establishes a critical precedent for trade law: when a state intervenes in digital finance, it must justify any restriction beyond the minimal necessary infrastructure. Brazil's legal restrictions on Pix were deliberate policy choices, not technological inevitabilities.

How CBDCs differ from traditional payment systems

CBDCs disrupt the traditional payment‑system stack because they merge the first two layers. A CBDC is not infrastructure for moving pre‑existing money; it is the money itself.

There are two types of CBDCs. Account‑based CBDCs, which most major economies are exploring, including China and the Eurosystem, exist as balances in a central bank ledger. These digital balances are created by verifying user identity—the principle of “I am, therefore I own.” The system for recording and transferring ownership is not a service for the money but constitutive of it. The currency cannot be separated from the account system that verifies its existence.

For token‑based CBDCs—portable digital units with cryptographic properties potentially based on distributed ledger technology, such as the Bahamas' sand dollar—the fusion is similar. These tokens are created by authenticating the digital object itself—the principle of “I know, therefore I own.” The protocols governing creation, validation, and transfer are constitutive of the money itself. Tokens may allow greater wallet‑level separability, but the underlying protocol defining what they are remains inseparable from the money.

The key practical difference: account-based CBDCs prioritize identity verification and regulatory oversight—the system always knows who holds what—making them well-suited for anti-money laundering compliance but requiring robust privacy protections. Token-based CBDCs prioritize portability and potential anonymity—tokens can transfer peer-to-peer like physical cash—but make regulatory oversight more challenging.

In both models, the infrastructure defines the money's existence and legitimacy. This collapse of the money‑infrastructure divide matters profoundly for trade law. Under international law, states have an unquestioned exclusive right to issue legal tender (money, at layer one). A monopoly on the foundational infrastructure of a CBDC—the core ledger and settlement engine (layer two)—is thus an extension of monetary sovereignty, residing outside the reach of trade agreements.

The danger lies in how countries extend this natural monopoly up the stack to layers three and four. While central‑bank control of wholesale CBDC infrastructure is inherent in monetary sovereignty, it does not require controlling the scheme (layer three) or application (layer four). While some early designs keep these layers separate, many are conflating them, using “sovereignty” as a shield for market foreclosure.

Distribution models and the three policy questions

There are two CBDC systems available to national governments. Intermediated systems can keep layers three and four open markets to competition, while direct systems inherently foreclose them.

Intermediated retail CBDCs use a two-tier structure: the central bank issues CBDC to financial or payment institutions, which then provide accounts or tokens to the public. China's e-CNY and the European Central Bank's (ECB) digital euro follow this architecture. Countries choose intermediated models not only to avoid overwhelming the central bank with retail operations, but also to leverage existing financial institutions, preserve their role in credit intermediation, and—crucially—enable the possibility of competition at the scheme and application layers.

In intermediated systems, the three-layer separation becomes architecturally feasible. The wholesale CBDC infrastructure could, in principle, support multiple retail schemes, much as India's IMPS supports UPI and alternative frameworks for business payments. This means that even if the infrastructure is a sovereign monopoly, extending that monopoly upward into the scheme layer is a policy choice, not a technological inevitability.

Direct retail CBDCs collapse infrastructure, scheme, and application into one layer, with the central bank itself providing accounts and tokens to the public. Because the central bank itself operates the ledger, designs the rules, and delivers the user interface, application-layer competition is not architecturally feasible. Small jurisdictions such as the Bahamas and Jamaica have adopted this model.

These small island economies lack both the domestic financial institutions to serve as intermediaries and the market size to attract competing foreign payment providers. With populations under 400,000 (Bahamas) and 3 million (Jamaica), the economics of operating competing payment applications don't work: fixed costs of compliance, technology, and support can't be spread across enough users. The central bank stepping in directly solves a genuine market failure rather than foreclosing a competitive market that would otherwise exist.

For direct CBDCs, the trade-law question is whether this full integration is genuinely necessary for the country's circumstances, or whether an intermediated design could have achieved the same policy goals—financial inclusion, monetary control, anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) robustness—while preserving competitive space. Direct models are inherently more exposed to application-layer scrutiny because they perform functions that in conventional payment markets are commercial services subject to GATS disciplines.

Against this backdrop, countries face three distinct policy decisions, each with its own trade-law implications.

1. Infrastructure closure. Operating the wholesale CBDC ledger is a sovereign act beyond trade commitments. But if that infrastructure could support multiple schemes, restricting it to one official scheme demands evidence of genuine necessity and lack of viable alternatives, not mere convenience or industrial policy.

2. Mandatory scheme participation. Even with open infrastructure, forcing intermediaries to offer the official scheme restricts competition. UPI's success illustrates that universal adoption can emerge from voluntary participation when the scheme offers superior functionality.

3. Application-layer restrictions. Even where scheme rivalry is limited, wallet-level competition remains possible. Limiting which apps may implement the CBDC scheme, excluding third-party providers, or imposing discriminatory licensing rules would foreclose competition that could otherwise occur. Such restrictions require evidence of genuine necessity.

The analytical test is simple: Does a restriction pertain to the sovereign monetary infrastructure, the rules of a scheme where alternatives are feasible, or the applications where competition is presumptively viable? Each layer demands a distinct and proportionate justification.

When restrictions might be justified

Countries defending more integrated CBDC models typically advance three lines of justification rooted in national context. Evaluating these claims is essential to distinguishing genuine public policy from disguised protectionism.

Technical necessity may justify single‑scheme architectures if managing monetary policy transmission, financial stability, and AML/CFT compliance across multiple schemes creates genuine systemic risks. But claims of necessity must show why regulatory oversight is insufficient. India's IMPS demonstrates that strong supervision can preserve stability without requiring scheme monopoly.

China's e-CNY illustrates how these arguments play out in practice. The People's Bank of China has cited technical necessity for centralized scheme control, arguing that monetary policy transmission and financial stability monitoring require unified oversight of the CBDC scheme. Whether these justifications meet the necessity test remains an open question. But notably, even with centralized scheme control, China has integrated e-CNY with applications like Alipay and WeChat Pay. This demonstrates that scheme-level restrictions, whatever their merit, need not extend to application-layer foreclosure.

Institutional context can also matter. Countries with concentrated banking markets, limited supervisory capacity, or weaker rule of law may argue that they lack the regulatory infrastructure to oversee scheme or application‑level competition. But institutional weakness cannot become a permanent industrial policy by another name. Temporary flexibility should include sunset clauses, require capacity-building programs, and establish clear evolution benchmarks.

Nigeria's eNaira provides a cautionary example of institutional constraints. Launched in 2021, it struggled with adoption partly because limited regulatory capacity made it difficult to supervise competing private-sector providers effectively, leading authorities to favor a highly centralized direct model. However, three years later, adoption remains under 0.5% of the population, suggesting that institutional weakness used to justify restrictions may create other problems if those restrictions prevent the innovation needed for user acceptance.

Concerns about data governance and financial stability may justify targeted restrictions. But these objectives can often be met through regulation—privacy rules, flow controls, holding limits—rather than foreclosure. Where restrictions are truly necessary, they should be proportionate and time‑limited.

The ECB's digital euro design process illustrates these trade-offs in practice. On data governance, the ECB has debated whether to restrict transaction data access to regulated intermediaries (more privacy-protective) or permit broader access to competing service providers (more competitive but raising surveillance concerns). On financial stability, proposals include holding limits to prevent excessive flows from bank deposits to digital euros, which could destabilize credit intermediation. In both cases, the challenge is achieving policy objectives through targeted regulation rather than using these concerns to foreclose private-sector participation entirely.

Geopolitical stakes and the path forward

The geopolitical stakes are significant. A global contest is unfolding over the template for sovereign digital money. At 14.2 trillion yuan ($2 trillion) China's e‑CNY has reached operational scale quickly, while the ECB's digital euro debates privacy, intermediaries, and data governance with implications that will reverberate globally. By retreating from retail CBDCs in favor of private stablecoins, the U.S. has left a standard‑setting vacuum, one that China and Europe are moving quickly to fill.

For developing countries, the dilemma is acute. The need for digital financial transformation is urgent, but restrictive architectures risk becoming “too‑big‑to‑reform” as millions of users and billions in transactions lock in users and the economy to CBDC systems. Legal clarity must come before launch. Waiting for a WTO dispute may make reform economically or politically impossible.

A new international consensus is urgently needed. The Bank for International Settlements, International Monetary Fund, and WTO should jointly issue guidance establishing clear principles: that wholesale CBDC infrastructure is a matter of monetary sovereignty; that for intermediated models, retail infrastructure should presumptively be open to multiple schemes; that application‑layer competition should be protected; and that deviations must be temporary, transparent, and grounded in evidence‑based necessity.

Together with technical assistance, such clarity would offer a roadmap for central banks, legal certainty for private innovators, and a guardrail against digital protectionism.

The path forward is not state money versus markets, but a synthesis: sovereign digital currency as a secure foundation, with open competition driving innovation above it. UPI shows that public infrastructure and private innovation can be powerful complements. CBDCs present the same opportunity on a broader and more consequential scale. We must seize it by crafting rules that respect sovereignty while championing openness.

The announcement of a business merger between Trump Media and Technology Group and TAE Technologies raises many questions.

What do a holding company for the U.S. president's media ventures and a nuclear fusion company have to gain from joining forces?

Does the deal create conflicts of interest?

And what does it mean for Trump Media's digital asset treasury partnership with Crypto.com?

TAE Technologies is a privately held fusion energy company based in California.

The firm's main focus is on developing nuclear fusion systems, a technology that has not yet achieved commercial viability.

In the meantime, TAE operates other business lines selling power management systems for electric vehicles and particle accelerators for the medical sector.

The merger with Trump Media will give TAE Technologies a foothold in the public market, with the combined entity valued at more than $8 billion in an all-stock deal that grants an equal stake to shareholders of both companies.

Statements  issued by TAE and Trump Media suggest the latter's “access to significant capital” is the primary motivation for teaming up.

As TAE prepares to start construction on the world's first “utility-scale” fusion power plant, what better way to attract investors than working with the President of the United States in the pursuit of American energy dominance?

But TAE is hardly the first company to use proximity to Trump for financial gain.

Beyond building power stations, the deal with TAE Technologies could have implications for Trump Media's various crypto ventures.

The pivot to energy suggests crypto has fallen down the group's list of priorities.

After all, the $300 million Trump Media will inject into TAE is money it won't be able to spend on initiatives like the CRO treasury company it set up with Crypto.com.

When that partnership was announced in August, media coverage focused on the headline figure of $6.4 billion.

But in reality, most of that value is attributed to a $5 billion line of credit that neither company is obliged to utilize.

The rest of it largely consists of Crypto.com's existing CRO holdings.

Now, with Trump Media's money and attention focused elsewhere, it seems even less likely the company would want to take on additional debt at a time when the digital asset treasury trend has lost much of its lustre.","{'href': 'https://www.ccn.com', 'title': 'CCN.com'}","cryptocurrency"

Zhao Xiaobao stands before rows of golden-sheened Huanghuali trees, each one worth a fortune yet locked in decades of growth. The Geely Technology Group representative sees liquid capital where others see immovable timber. His team photographs and catalogues every trunk on this Hainan plantation, preparing what he calls the first biological asset tokenization project worldwide.

“We are converting the dormant resource of precious wood into tradeable assets,” Zhao explained. The company plans to launch tokens in Hong Kong within months, dividing each tree's value into multiple digital shares. Farmers who wait 30 years for harvest could access immediate funding through blockchain markets.

The tokenization wave extends far beyond timber. Shanghai Teaken Technologies issues digital certificates for fermented pu'er tea cakes, addressing rampant fraud where five-year vintages pose as decade-old treasures. CEO Eric Ma built authentication into every transaction. “We really want to build a platform for tea collectors to safely own and share and maybe pass on this premium quality good tea with transparency and trust,” he said. The company provides climate-controlled cellars for physical storage while buyers trade digital ownership.

Juno Zhu, a 27-year-old advertising professional from Xiamen, purchased 100 digital tea cakes as investments and gifts. “It's backed by something of value. It's not a token based on nothingness,” she noted. Each certificate cost her 700 yuan.

China Qidian Guofeng Holdings joined the trend, converting 62 metric tons of baijiu into digital assets. The liquor tokenization project seeks HK$500 million through arrangements with major shareholders.

Hong Kong embraces this financial innovation while mainland authorities maintain distance. The China Securities Regulatory Commission quietly advised mainland brokerages to pause tokenization activities in Hong Kong, according to industry sources. A December statement from Chinese financial regulators warned criminals exploit stablecoins and tokenized assets for illegal fundraising.

“Regulators are targeting fraudsters who use RWA to raise money illegally,” explained Liu Honglin of Man Kun law firm in Shanghai. Compliant projects that stimulate consumption face fewer obstacles, he added.

The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission confirmed tokenized securities fall under existing regulations. Mainland citizens can still purchase tokens through Hong Kong brokerage accounts despite Beijing's 2021 cryptocurrency trading ban.

Market dynamics present challenges beyond regulation. Eric Zuo from Tadwill & Co manages a 523 million yuan tokenization for a bankrupt Sichuan hydro dam. “There are way more assets than investors willing to buy them. We need to expand the investor base,” he observed.

Lawyer Liao Renliang at Yingke Law Firm reports inquiries spanning artifacts, collectibles, data assets, commodities, and real estate. Each sector wants blockchain financing, yet demand remains uncertain. The global tokenization market reached $35.7 billion, dominated by U.S. Treasury-backed products rather than exotic Asian assets.

Geely's Zhao envisions broader applications for his forestry model, suggesting it could “turn green mountains and clear waters into gold and silver.” Whether investors share this vision remains the billion-dollar question as Chinese companies rush to digitize tangible treasures.

Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), the parent of President Donald Trump's Truth Social, has agreed to merge with nuclear fusion company TAE Technologies in an all-stock deal valued at more than $6 billion.

DJT shares are higher by 25% in early trading on Thursday, though still remaining sharply lower on a year-to-date basis.

The deal will transform Trump Media from a social media operator into a clean energy and financial assets play, said the company in a press release.

It builds on a crypto strategy the firm has been rolling out, having partnered with crypto exchange Crypto.com earlier this year to launch a fintech unit called Truth.Fi, while also introducing crypto-linked exchanged traded funds tied to BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, and the exchange's CRO token.

The company has also built a large crypto balance sheet. Trump Media holds 11,542 BTC worth around $1.02 billion, and invested $105 million in CRO back in September as part of its partnership with the exchange.

Bitcoin's BTC$86,817.46 stark rejection at $90,000 on Wednesday was a quick reminder for investors that precious metals like gold and silver are the real winners of the debasement trade, not — at least for the moment — digital gold.

Back in October, JPMorgan analysts said that gold and bitcoin were both benefitting and would continue to benefit from the so-called debasement trade. They projected BTC to follow gold's lead, putting a $165,000 BTC price target on a volatility-adjusted basis relative to gold.

So far, that thesis hasn't played out.

While BTC is languishing around $88,000, down 30% from its early October record, gold is trading near record highs around $4,350 an ounce and silver Wednesday hit fresh all-time highs above $66, up 40% since October.

""Bitcoiners can't ignore the bull market in precious metals, which continues to roar,"" said Charlie Morris, founder of ByteTree.

Bitcoin's current weakness stems from its linkage to risky assets, Morris wrote in a Wednesday report. While stock indices have been hovering near record highs, the most speculative pockets of the equity market – data centers and artificial intelligence infrastructure bets and recent IPO names – saw heavy drawdowns over the past few weeks.

There's also a technical element behind bitcoin's relative weakness to gold. The BTC-gold ratio already peaked in late 2024, and is deep into a bear market tumbling over 50%.

In August, BTC-gold made a lower high, pointing to fading momentum, and since than has rolled over, making a fresh low on Wednesday and its weakest level in almost two years.

Structural selling from long-term holders has also added to bitcoin's weakness. Research from Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33, noted that BTC supply held in UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) older than two years has been in a persistent decline, with roughly 1.6 million BTC reactivated since 2024. Separately, Glassnode data also shows that long-term investors have ramped up selling their holdings.

""This represents onchain evidence of substantial, sustained selling pressure from long-term holders,"" Lunde said.

There's also growing discussion around the risks quantum computing poses to Bitcoin's cryptographic security. While the concern remains largely theoretical, it has added a layer of uncertainty for investors.

The silver lining – no pun intended – for bitcoin investors is that BTC should eventually take the baton from gold as the yellow metal's rally cools.

Historical patterns show that gold peaks often precede BTC rallies by 100-150 trading days, Bitfinex analysts pointed out. They said that bitcoin's current market consolidation is a transitional phase, laying the groundwork for a catch-up in 2026.

Bytetree's Morris expressed a similar view.

“I remain bullish on silver, but it won't go on forever,"" Morris said. ""I suspect that when the rally runs out of steam, bitcoin will step in.""

From ""it's so over"" to ""we're so back"" – market sentiment flips fast these days on social media. 

Just days after AI bubble fears resurfaced, Micron (MU), a critical supplier of memory chips used in AI infrastructure and data centers, has posted blowout earnings, reversing the bearish sentiment.

This led to U.S. technology futures trading up in pre-market on Thursday, with the Invesco QQQ up nearly 1% pre-market after falling almost 2% on Wednesday.  Bitcoin, too, has stabilized above $87,000 following its wild swings in both directions on Wednesday. BTC and tech stocks tend to move in lockstep, with the AI boom at the center of the positive correlation since late 2022. 

According to the latest earnings report, Micron reported Q1 2026 revenue of $13.6 billion, a 57% year-over-year increase. Gross margins surged to 56%, compared with 38% a year earlier, while operating income jumped to $6.1 billion. Net income reached $5.24 billion, nearly triple last year's level, with diluted EPS of $4.60, beating Wall Street's estimate of $3.96, according to FactSet data.

AI-driven demand was the standout theme. Micron's cloud memory business unit saw revenue double year on year, while mobile and client revenue rose 63%, according to an earnings presentation. According to the conference call, the firm now forecasts Q2 2026 revenue of $18 to $19 billion, which is above the expectation of $17.8 billion, according to FactSet data. The management also said that it is effectively sold out of key AI memory products through 2026. Shares rose around 12% pre-market to about $250.

The strong results offered relief amid ongoing AI jitters at Oracle (ORCL), Broadcom (AVG) and CoreWeave (CRWV). AI and crypto-linked equities edged slightly higher pre-market, highlighting the growing crossover, which is being fueled by the AI narrative.

UPDATE (Dec. 18, 13:55 UTC): Updates to add company earnings, presentation and management discussion filings; analysts' estimates.

Coinbase (COIN) shares rose as much as 4.6% after the company outlined a roadmap that included equity trading, AI-powered tools, tokenization and stablecoin infrastructure in its end-of-year System Update.

The stock rose to as high as $255.41 in early trading Thursday and was priced recently at $249.48 after the Wednesday announcement.

J.P. Morgan's Kenneth Worthington said the event showed Coinbase expanding its reach by introducing more asset classes and tools to keep users engaged. He highlighted the introduction of U.S. equity trading, perpetual equity futures for non-U.S. users, and the Coinbase Advisor product as signals that the company is reshaping its core business.

“The Coinbase announcements last night highlighted that it is giving its customers far more products to transact,” he wrote Thursday, adding that the expansion “meaningfully increases"" Coinbase's total addressable market. While revenue details were sparse, Worthington said he sees opportunity in both subscription and transaction-based models. He also noted the rollout of branded stablecoins and Base App expansion as important steps toward long-term engagement.

J.P. Morgan rates Coinbase overweight with a $244.19 price target.

Owen Lau, an analysts at Clear Street, came away with a similar view, calling the update a coordinated product expansion that marks Coinbase's transition from a crypto-only exchange into a broader financial platform. He pointed to the addition of stock trading as a notable shift, especially because the company had previously downplayed the idea. The move may signal future plans to offer tokenized equities, Lau said.

The introduction of an AI-powered advisor also stood out. Lau said it could become a valuable tool for simplifying investment decisions and increasing customer retention, especially for less experienced users. He noted that direct deposit features and crypto lending could help Coinbase gain traction as a primary financial account, though competing with traditional banks for paycheck deposits will be a challenge.

Derivatives remain a core part of the growth strategy, Lau wrote, citing the introduction of equity futures with up to 20x leverage and around-the-clock market access. Because derivatives tend to generate higher volume and revenue stability, Lau said they could help reduce Coinbase's earnings volatility over time. Coinbase announced the $2.9 billion acquisition of crypto options exchange Deribit in May.

Clear Street has a Buy rating on Coinbase with a $415 price target.

Citi analysts, led by Peter Christiansen, said the update is a milestone that expands access to new and traditional assets while building out payments, developer tools and tokenization rails that could deepen liquidity over time.

The event underscored Coinbase's effort to expand access to a broader range of assets, which ""deepens the platform's competitive moat,"" analysts led by Peter Christiansen wrote.

The analysts also pointed to payments and money-transfer utility tied to stablecoin USDC and newer x402 payments as steps toward diversifying revenue and enabling fresh use cases such as agentic commerce.

Upgrades to Coinbase's developer tools via CDP, alongside efforts to connect onchain functionality with traditional finance through tokenization and on/off-ramps, bolster the company's ambition to be an “operating system” for onchain activity, the analysts said.

Citi called Coinbase's “Everything Exchange” plan ambitious and said investors will need solid execution, including clearer disclosure on how it executes, along with greater regulatory certainty to look past near-term volatility and focus on longer-term catalysts.

The bank said it remains convinced the upside is too significant to ignore and continues to see Coinbase's category leadership strengthening, maintaining its buy rating and $505 price target.

Barclays, in contrast, holds an equal weight rating on Coinbase with a $291 price target.

 Many of the crypto ETP applications awaiting SEC approval will launch in 2026, but a lot of those won't survive beyond 2027, says Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart. 

More than 100 crypto exchange-traded products are likely to hit the market in 2026, but many of them will quickly be shuttered due to a lack of demand, an analyst says.

Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart said on Wednesday that he agreed with a 2026 prediction from crypto asset manager Bitwise that over 100 crypto ETFs would launch, but he said that many wouldn't last.

“We're going to see a lot of liquidations in crypto ETP products. Might happen at [the] tail end of 2026 but likely by the end of 2027,” Seyffart said, adding that over 126 ETP applications are currently awaiting an outcome from the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

“Issuers are throwing A LOT of product at the wall.”

Last year, a total of 622 ETFs closed down, including over 189 in the US, The Daily Upside noted last month. Morningstar reported in January 2024 that the 244 ETFs that closed in the US in 2023 had an average age of 5.4 years.

Most of these investment products shut down because they failed to attract sufficient inflows, resulting in low assets under management.

Several crypto ETPs have already been liquidated this year, the most noteworthy being the ARK 21Shares Active Bitcoin Ethereum Strategy ETF (ARKY) and ARK 21Shares Active On‑Chain Bitcoin Strategy ETF (ARKC).

Industry analysts expect an explosion in the number of crypto ETPs approved in 2026 under the SEC's new generic listing standards, which no longer require that each application be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

Even before the SEC's generic listing standards came into effect in September, asset managers had filed to launch ETFs tied to increasingly speculative tokens, such as Melania Trump‘s memecoin.

ETFs tracking Litecoin (LTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP (XRP) launched with relative success this year, expanding from the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) ETFs that launched in 2024.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have accumulated $57.6 billion worth of inflows since launching in January 2024, while spot Ether ETFs have amassed $12.6 billion since July 2024, Farside Investors data shows.

Meanwhile, spot Solana ETFs from Bitwise, VanEck, Fidelity, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale have seen $725 million since late October.

Two Möbius Strips Combine to Create a Bizarre Object That Only Exists in 4D

In geometry, there are surfaces that do without an inside or outside—and some need at least four dimensions to exist

By Manon Bischoff edited by Daisy Yuhas

Visually, the “Klein bottle” doesn't seem all that impressive. On first glance it looks like a trendy Japandi-style vase. And yet it has fascinated mathematicians for more than 140 years.

To understand why, we have to travel far back to the ancient Roman Empire, where the first traces of a somewhat simpler geometric shape can be found: the Möbius strip. This enigmatic shape is incredibly easy to make: Take a long strip of paper and bring both ends together. But before you glue the ends to each other, rotate one by 180 degrees. The result is a twisted band.

From a mathematical perspective, Möbius strips are fascinating because they have only one surface and one edge. Unlike a cylindrical object (such as one created by gluing together the ends of a strip that hasn't been twisted), there is no inside or outside. For physicists, these twisted shapes make for excellent points of comparison when contemplating the properties of subatomic particles, such as the spin of the electron, which must be rotated by 720 degrees to get back to its start. And in factories, Möbius strips have been used as conveyor belts because they wear out significantly more slowly than untwisted belts, for which only one side is stressed.

You can touch every point of a Möbius strip by running your finger along the shape's surface without lifting it. Mathematicians refer to this as a “nonorientable” surface. If you enjoy hands-on experiments, I highly recommend trying to cut a Möbius strip lengthwise in different ways—the results are astonishing.

The German mathematician Felix Klein was also fascinated by the possibilities of these strange surfaces. He reasoned that if you glued two ordinary strips together along their respective edges, you could get a wider strip—that is, one edge of each strip would disappear. But a Möbius strip only has a single edge. So what happens if you glue two Möbius strips together? In this case, a surface without a border results. This strange creation is the Klein bottle, a surface that, like a Möbius strip, has neither an inside nor an outside.

Now, if you're getting ready to start taping together strips of paper to put this idea into action, I'm afraid I have to disappoint you. A true Klein bottle can only be created in four spatial dimensions. Yes, there are bottles inspired by the Klein bottle that exist in three dimensions, but they are technically just artifacts of the true Klein bottle in four dimensions. That's because, when you embed this figure in 3D space, the bottle will invariably intersect itself, an obstacle that does not arise when you shape it in 4D space.

That said, we can at least try to visualize the Klein bottle. Imagine gluing the right and left edges of a piece of paper together, forming an ordinary cylinder. Then you glue the top and bottom edges together. But first, as with the Möbius strip, you twist them by 180 degrees.

Amanda Montañez

Like the Möbius strip, the Klein bottle also possesses fascinating mathematical properties. Among other things, it represents the only exception to the Ringel-Youngs theorem, which deals with the coloring of objects. For example, if you want to draw a map and color the individual countries without neighboring countries having the same color, you only need four different colors—regardless of how the countries are arranged.

More generally, the Ringel-Youngs four-color theorem states the maximum number of colors needed to color countries on surfaces of different shapes. As it turns out, this depends on the number of holes in the surfaces. For example, I might decide to create a map for a doughnut-shaped planet. What is the maximum number of colors I would need in that case? Because the planet has one hole, it follows from the theorem that, at most, seven colors will suffice.

The Ringel-Youngs theorem applies to all surfaces except the Klein bottle. According to the theorem, the Klein bottle should only be colorable with a maximum of seven colors; as it turns out, however, six colors are always sufficient for the small bottle.

Amanda Montañez

Because of such unique properties—and its nonorientability—the Klein bottle is one of several popular and mind-bending objects among mathematicians. It also appears in physics, where it can help describe complex quantum states, much as the Möbius strip illustrates spin states.

If you have any nerdy friends, the 3D Klein bottle—though not quite the real deal—could be a great Christmas present. You can even use it as a vase or wine decanter.

Genetic differences are only the beginning of acquiring this rare ability.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Most people can agree that the sky is blue and the sun is yellow. But, color is a highly personal experience, and there is no way of knowing whether your blue is the same as mine. In fact, there is growing scientific evidence that it's not. 

Most people have three types of cone cells in the eye that perceive color, but some people are born with a fourth type that lets them see colors the rest of us don't even have names for. But, understanding whether their visual world is richer than ours brings us back to the original problem: how would we know? 

The challenge is understanding how color works in the first place. Color is not a fixed property of an object, but rather an experience created in our brains as signals travel from the cones in the retina. About 12 percent of all women—including up to 50 percent of Caucasian women—carry a gene that produces an extra photopigment on their X chromosome, a light-sensitive molecule in the cone cell. Whereas most people, called trichromats, have three cones with photopigments tuned to red, blue, and green, tetrachromats have a fourth. However, the essence of the puzzle is not in having the extra photopigment or cone, but in knowing how to tell if they are using it to see new colors.

“If someone truly had four-dimensional color vision, we could never know what that looks like to them,” visual neuroscientist Jenny Bosten, PhD, says. “All we can do is infer it from whether they discriminate colors in ways that their extra cone class would predict.”

In 2010, Bosten, who is a professor at the University of Sussex in the UK, and her colleagues set out to do just that. They enrolled 24 women suspected of having a genetic variant for a fourth photopigment and administered a series of rigorous visual tests. The women were shown numerous pairs of carefully chosen color spectra that scientists predicted should look identical to trichromats, but distinct to tetrachromats. Just like a color-blind person (dichromat) cannot distinguish certain hues of red and green, a trichromat has similar blind spots. But surprisingly, despite all having the genetic predisposition for the extra cone, most women did not have enhanced vision. Only one, known as CDA29, consistently succeeded in detecting differences invisible to everyone else in the study. Her performance remains some of the strongest empirical evidence for functional tetrachromacy in humans.

🔮 Check Out Our New Video Series, Pop Mech Explains: PrecognitionYou've probably had that eerie feeling before—knowing what's about to happen before it actually does. Flashes of deja vu. A text from someone you were just thinking about. A dream predicting the future. Coincidence? Or something deeper? Across four chapters, we investigate the science and speculation behind those “gut feelings.” Go Down the Rabbit Hole With Us 

Does this mean most cases of true tetrachromacy are extremely rare? Perhaps, yes, says Bosten. But, there could be other explanations. Having this ability could depend on cone sensitivity, environmental factors, or limitations of the testing. According to Bosten, if the fourth cone's sensitivity falls within a few nanometers of one of the three existing cones, the brain may simply not register the cone's signals as a distinct color. Normal trichromats have peak sensitivities separated by about 30 nanometers. But in someone with the mutation, the fourth cone might sit only a few nanometers away from one of the existing cones. If the wavelength difference is too small, the brain will blend it with what's already there.

Additionally, a person's environment could influence this genetic potential. According to Kimberly Jameson, PhD, a cognitive scientist at the University of California, Irvine,  tetrachomacy might develop in individuals with the gene who find the color signal more relevant in their daily lives and have nurtured the extra sense. “Mozart was gifted in terms of his auditory system, but if he were raised in a family of goat herds, he may have never become a great composer,” she says. 

Vision scientist Michael Webster, PhD, at the University of Nevada, has shown that the environment influences color perception. He has studied how people in tropical environments might calibrate their vision over time so that lush greens and vivid blues become less intense. And people living in arid landscapes devoid of color do the opposite. 

He says that the world is built for trichromats, in which nearly all displays, pigments, and lighting are engineered around three primary colors, and a fourth photopigment might provide information that the brain simply learns to ignore. In other words, the environment may hide tetrachromacy from the very people who possess it. “When your grandkids move to Mars, it won't look red to them … if you're living in a red world, it just looks grey,” he says. 

Tetrachromats report seeing colors in the places trichromats can't. Whites become prismatic, dark shadows contain hues of lavender and gold. To them, the neural greys and blacks contain a mosaic of colors that the rest of us are simply unaware of. 

However, these are just anecdotes.

At his lab at UC Berkeley, computer scientist Ren Ng, PhD, aims to develop an empirical test for tetrachromacy, just like the color-blindness tests that show circles of colored dots containing hidden numbers. But first, he says, he will have to “invent” colors that most of us can't see.

So far, instead of a color wheel, Ng has created a three-dimensional color sphere to capture the fourth cone's extra dimension. “For tetrachromats, the entire geometry of color space changes,” he tells Popular Mechanics.  Instead of sitting next to two other colors of the rainbow, each color is now flanked by four.  Orange is not only next to yellow and red, but it also bumps into dark green and pink. “Where you see gray, a tetrachromat might see a completely different hue; maybe an entire ring of hues,” he says.

Ng's team built this four-dimensional color sphere by modeling the colors that a human with four cones might see. It uses data about the genetics and physics of the four cone cells, specifically the light sensitivity spectrum of the photopigments. In the process, he even predicted the existence of two new colors, “keef” and “litz,” named after artists Georgia O'Keeffe and photographer Alfred Stieglitz. To a trichromat, they just look grey, but a tetrachromat should be able to see these colors pop against the others. 

Next, his team built a specialized printer with four inks instead of three. The standard colors used in trichromatic printers are cyan, magenta, and yellow, but in Ng's tetrachromatic version, they used four: cyan, violet, pink, and yellow.  

If Ng's test succeeds, we may finally have the tools to identify the tetrachromats hiding among us, and to understand the colors they see in the grey shadows, even if we can't experience them for ourselves yet. 

“But, a tetrachromat may be navigating a world where colors we think of as identical are as different as red and green,” he says.

Particles that escaped Earth's atmosphere accumulated on the lunar surface over billions of years.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

When samples of lunar dust touched down with returning astronauts during the Apollo era, it was still unknown that those containers held molecules that had journeyed from Earth to the Moon and back.

Later analysis of Apollo 17 samples revealed volatile elements and substances (like water and carbon dioxide) in the loose regolith that were not found in rocks collected on the mission. Those volatiles (along with elemental helium, argon, and nitrogen) were thought to have been brought over by the solar wind, as the weak atmosphere of the Moon makes it easy for charged particles to bombard its surface. But there was still a problem: The amounts of volatiles present were too high to have come from the Sun alone.

Further analysis—led by researchers from the University of Tokyo—came to the conclusion that some of these volatiles must have come from Earth's atmosphere at a time when the young planet had not yet developed a magnetic field. The researchers thought that this was the only way such particles could have made it past Earth, since they would have supposedly been held back by a magnetic field once it was up and running. 

That was in 2005. Now, a research team—led by astrophysicist Shubhonkar Paramanick from the University of Rochester—has determined another way the particles could have landed on the Moon. Instead of impeding them, Earth's magnetic field lines may actually be guiding particles from the atmosphere into space, where they ride the solar wind to the Moon.

Paramanick thinks that most of these particles travel via Earth's magnetotail, which is formed by the solar wind as it pushes against one side of Earth's magnetosphere. In this tail are a northern and southern lobe of identical magnetic field lines, divided by a sheet of plasma. Because of turbulence, unstable plasma, and magnetic reconnection (when magnetic field lines break and connect again) occurring within the magnetotail, atmospheric particles from Earth are released. They can then travel along magnetic field lines in the magnetotail until solar wind takes them. When the Moon is facing the nightside of Earth (from which the magnetotail streams), many of those particles land on lunar soil. 

“Atmospheric transfer is efficient only when the Moon is within Earth's magnetotail,” Paramanick said in a study recently published in Nature Communications Earth & Environment. “The non-solar contribution to the lunar soil is best explained by implantation during the long history of the geodynamo under present-day solar wind conditions, rather than by any brief, putatively unmagnetized epoch of the early Archean Earth.”

Unlike the Moon or Mars, Earth has a geodynamo (a force that generates its magnetic field). As molten metals in the outer core undergo convection—with gravity causing hotter and less dense material to rise as cooler and denser material to sink—a magnetic field arises from electrical charges in motion. Earth's magnetic field is 3.7 billion years old, and over those years, the shifting of terrestrial particles to the Moon could have functionally created a record of primordial Earth in its grayish dust. 

When the Rochester research team ran computer simulations of particles escaping from ancient Earth (with its weaker magnetic field and a stronger incoming solar wind) versus modern Earth (which has a much stronger magnetic field and is impacted by a weaker solar wind), they found that more particles are transferred in the modern Earth scenario. This could also mean that the Moon has more volatiles than we previously thought. Molecules trapped in grains of regolith could supply astronauts on future missions with breathable air and drinkable water, saving the weight and expense of flying them over from Earth. 

This research could also have implications for how Mars lost its atmosphere. The Red Planet is thought to have once had a thicker atmosphere that might have made it habitable, but most likely lost it when electric currents in its dynamo ceased moving. Comparing the evolution of Earth and Mars, along with the particles escaping from their atmospheres, could tell us how their habitability evolved over the eons.

“Material from the present-day Earth's atmosphere can indeed account for the non-solar contributions to nitrogen and noble gas constituents in lunar soil,” said Paramanick, “offering a plausible explanation for the observed isotope ratio differences between solar and non-solar sources.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","The western U.S. Tried to stop wildfires and it backfired","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251218060550.htm","Thu, 18 Dec 2025 15:19:32 GMT","

Wildfires are not always purely destructive. In many forests, fire can clear out built up dead material, return nutrients to the soil, and help ecosystems reset. For more than 100 years, the United States has spent billions of dollars on fire suppression to protect people, homes, and sensitive environments. But putting out too many fires can also prevent landscapes from getting the burns they need, allowing extra fuel to accumulate and raising the risk of larger fires later.

New research to be presented at AGU's 2025 Annual Meeting in New Orleans reports that nearly 38 million hectares of land in the western United States are historically behind on burning. The researchers describe these areas as being in a ""fire deficit."" This estimate was revised from 59 million hectares in the abstract to a final total of 38 million hectares.

""Conditions are getting so warm and dry that it's causing huge amounts of fire compared to the historical record,"" said Winslow Hansen, director of the Western Fire and Forest Resilience Collaborative and scientist at Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies. ""However, we still are dealing with the legacy of 150 years of fire suppression. Together, drying conditions and overly dense fuels portend a challenging and more fiery future.""

Hansen will present the findings on December 18 at AGU25, joining more than 20,000 scientists discussing the latest Earth and space science research.

How scientists mapped fire deficit and fire surplus

To determine where fire is missing and where it is happening too often, the team used geospatial evidence such as pollen records and dirt samples. From that information, they estimated historical fire return intervals, which were then reconstructed through the Landfire program.

When the team compared modern annual burn patterns with the historical record revealed by the data, they found that 74% of the western U.S. is currently in a fire deficit. To close that gap, forests would need about 3.8 million hectares to burn each year for a decade. That annual amount is three times the forest area that burned in 2020, which remains the record year for wildfire burn area in the U.S.

Strategies to reduce wildfire risk and restore healthier fire cycles

The scale of that burning is intimidating, but Hansen and his colleagues say there are several ways to make progress. They point to a mix of prescribed burns, mechanical thinning, and the use of managed wildfire to reduce the deficit.

""There are still lots of wildfires that burn today… that are reducing our fuel loads and revitalizing ecosystems,"" said Hansen. ""Instead of suppressing those fires and putting them out, we've got to let them do good ecological work to help us tackle this challenge when risk is low.""

Some regions have the opposite problem too much fire

Even as much of the West is overdue for fire, the southwest is dealing with the reverse situation. Human started wildfires have pushed shrublands and chapparal ecosystems into a fire surplus, especially in Southern California.

""You're getting more fire than you would have historically, which can even threaten resilience,"" Hansen said. ""These shrubland ecosystems might not be able to regenerate if the fire is too frequent.""

Parts of Cascadia are also showing a fire surplus, which the researchers link to climate change driving higher temperatures and more drought, conditions that can set the stage for blazes.

""I was a little bit surprised to see these signals of climate change-driven surplus already,"" said Hansen. ""I'd expected that would be something we would see in the next decade or two instead.""

Abstract information

B42C-08 Erasing the western US forest-fire deficit will require approximately 60 million hectares of ecologically beneficial burning over the next decade.

A new study published on Dec. 16 in Environmental Science & Technology Letters reports that some firefighter protective gear contains brominated flame retardants, chemicals that may pose health risks to firefighters.

The research is the first U.S. study to formally examine and document the use of brominated flame retardants in firefighter turnout gear, which is worn during emergency responses. The findings could play a role in how fire departments decide whether to continue using existing equipment or invest in replacements.

Structural firefighters -- those working in the built environment -- rely on turnout gear made up of three distinct layers. These include a flame-resistant outer shell, a middle moisture barrier that blocks germs while allowing airflow, and an inner lining designed to help regulate body temperature.

According to lead author Heather Stapleton, Ronie-Richele Garcia-Johnson Distinguished Professor at Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment, manufacturers apply chemical treatments to these garments to ensure they meet strict safety standards set by the National Fire Protection Association.

PFAS Concerns Raise New Questions

For several years, firefighters have expressed concern about the presence of PFAS in turnout gear. These chemicals are used to repel oil and water and can also contribute to flame resistance. Numerous studies involving humans and animals have linked PFAS exposure to health problems, including certain cancers.

While no studies have directly connected PFAS treated turnout gear to health outcomes in firefighters, manufacturers have begun moving away from these chemicals. In addition, multiple states have passed laws that will ban the purchase of PFAS treated turnout gear starting in 2027.

As PFAS are phased out, attention has turned to what substances may be taking their place. Chemical ingredients used in turnout gear treatments are not typically disclosed by manufacturers.

""There was a rumor that one of the turnout gear manufacturers might be using brominated flame retardants in the non-PFAS treated textiles,"" Stapleton said. ""Because some brominated flame retardants have known toxicity, I requested a sample of the gear in question to test.'""

Why Brominated Flame Retardants Matter

Brominated flame retardants are commonly added to fabrics and other products to reduce how easily they ignite. Exposure to these chemicals has been linked to health concerns including cancer, thyroid disease, and problems with brain development.

Stapleton's initial testing confirmed the presence of brominated flame retardants in the turnout gear sample. That finding led to a broader study conducted in collaboration with researchers at North Carolina State University's Wilson College of Textiles and the International Association of Fire Fighters. The goal was to examine how often PFAS and brominated flame retardants appeared in turnout gear made during different time periods.

Peeling Back the Layers

The research team analyzed nine sets of used turnout gear manufactured between 2013 and 2020, along with three sets produced in 2024 that were marketed as non-PFAS treated. Using two analytical techniques, the scientists tested each layer of the gear for both PFAS and brominated flame retardants. This approach allowed them to measure total chemical content as well as the portion that could transfer during use, referred to as ""extractable"" levels.

""We wanted to know which chemicals were intentionally applied during manufacturing, and we wanted to know what was likely to leach out over time, which could raise the risk of exposure through skin absorption or inhalation,"" Stapleton said.

As expected, PFAS were detected in all turnout gear produced between 2013 and 2020. In contrast, gear manufactured in 2024 showed only low or non-detectable extractable PFAS levels, indicating the garments had not been treated with these chemicals, consistent with manufacturer claims. The small amounts detected were likely picked up from the surrounding environment during use, the authors noted.

Every set of turnout gear tested also contained brominated flame retardants, with extractable levels generally higher than those measured for PFAS.

Higher Levels in PFAS Free Gear

The highest extractable concentrations of brominated flame retardants were found in gear marketed as non-PFAS treated, particularly within the moisture barrier. Stapleton said this suggests manufacturers intentionally added brominated flame retardants to meet flammability requirements, likely replacing a PFAS compound previously used in that layer.

Among the chemicals identified, decabromodiphenyl ethane, or DBDPE, appeared at the highest extractable levels.

Although no U.S. studies have examined health effects linked to DBDPE exposure, the researchers pointed to a 2019 study of workers at a chemical manufacturing plant in China. That study found associations between DBDPE exposure, altered thyroid hormone levels, and signs of thyroid disease.

""I was really surprised that the manufacturers used DBDPE in turnout gear,"" Stapleton said. ""It has similar properties as a toxic chemical called decaBDE that has been largely phased out globally, raising questions about its safety.""

Fire Exposure Versus Manufacturing Choices

For turnout gear produced between 2013 and 2020, the outer shell typically contained higher extractable levels of brominated flame retardants than the moisture barrier or inner lining. Stapleton said this pattern likely reflects buildup from smoke and soot encountered during fires.

""When building materials burn, they can release brominated flame retardants into the air that stick to gear and don't wash out very well,"" she explained.

At the same time, the presence of these chemicals in internal layers suggests that some manufacturers had incorporated brominated flame retardants into turnout gear treatments for years, even before PFAS began to be phased out, according to the authors.

Weighing the Costs

While researchers have not yet determined firefighters' exact exposure levels or the long-term health effects associated with these chemicals, the study provides new information for fire departments evaluating protective gear.

""Turnout gear is really expensive -- one set costs thousands of dollars -- and firefighters often use these garments for many years. Fire departments must consider both the financial and personal safety costs of keeping or replacing gear,"" said coauthor R. Bryan Ormond, an associate professor at the Wilson College of Textiles and director of NC State's Milliken Textile Protection and Comfort Center, who studies trade-offs in gear performance.

Stapleton noted that some manufacturers now offer turnout gear that avoids both PFAS and brominated flame retardants. She encouraged fire departments to push for clearer disclosure about chemical treatments used in protective equipment.

""We know firefighters receive higher exposure to multiple chemicals from all the hazards they face during their duty, and they shouldn't have to worry about receiving additional chemical exposures from their gear,"" said Stapleton, who also leads a study on cancer incidence in firefighters. ""These first responders are a critically important component of our public safety and deserve to be respected and protected.""

Study Support and Funding

This project was supported by the North Carolina Collaboratory at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, with funding appropriated by the North Carolina General Assembly (to HMS and BO). HMS also wishes to thank Michael and Annie Falk for establishing the Falk Exposomics Laboratory.

Cell migration is a key cellular process that drives major developmental programs. To mimic and mechanistically understand cell migration in these different contexts, different assays have been developed. However, owing to the lack of practical guidelines, these different cell migration assays are often used interchangeably. This and the inherent dynamic nature of cell migration, which often requires sophisticated live-cell microscopy, may have caused cell migration to be notably less well understood than equally important cell functions, such as cell differentiation or proliferation. In this Review, we describe commonly used custom and commercial in vitro and in vivo cell migration assays and provide a comprehensive practical guide and decision tree outlining how to choose and implement an assay that best suits the biological question at hand. We hope this guidance spurs biological insights into this complex process and encourages future methods development.

The Whispers of Rock



Anjana Khatwa Bridge Street Press (2025)

In 1902, on the Caribbean island of Saint Vincent, a group of women reported that water was boiling in the crater of the La Soufrière volcano, accompanied by booming sounds and shaking, but they were ignored by the colonial authorities. The subsequent eruption killed 1,680 islanders. This is one of many global examples of the public's appreciation of nature in Earth scientist Anjana Khatwa's enticing book. “Awakening yourself to the whispers of rock”, she says, “can transform the way you connect with and understand the world”.

Lo—TEK Water



Julia Watson Taschen (2025)

Water is “not a resource to be extracted or managed, but a living relative, a system of memory, intelligence, and reciprocity”, says landscape designer Julia Watson. This view underlies the Lo—TEK movement that she spearheads, which draws on Indigenous philosophy that water is a regenerative substance. Her pioneering, lavishly illustrated book contains contributions from many communities, from Bangladesh's floating farms to China's dike-pond systems and Micronesia's traps to catch fish using tide flows.

Surviving the Twenty-First Century



Noam Chomsky & José Mujica Verso (2025)

In 2017 and 2022, filmmaker Saúl Alvídrez recorded conversations between linguist Noam Chomsky and political activist José Mujica, former president of Uruguay. Their discussions range from the risks of climate change to neo-fascism and the wisdom of nature, and make up this brief, thought-provoking book. Despite mutual admiration, the two do disagree at times. For example, Chomsky says that automation will “free people to undertake truly creative and satisfying work”, but Mujica says that “robots work only for their masters!”

Nature Synthesis

                         (2025)Cite this article


Skeletal editing via nitrogen atom insertion into cyclic frameworks is a non-conventional and powerful strategy for constructing functionalized N heterocycles—privileged scaffolds in both synthetic chemistry and pharmaceutical science. Despite their importance, general methods for the direct insertion of nitrogen into carbocycles, particularly saturated ones, remain limited due to the challenge of selectively activating of inert C–C bonds. Here we report an electrochemical platform that enables efficient nitrogen atom insertion into saturated carbocycles under mild conditions. Two distinct protocols have been developed, allowing access to either functionalized quinolines or N-alkylated saturated N heterocycles, both with excellent selectivity and broad functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies reveal the involvement of benzylic carbocation and cyclic imine intermediates, which undergo divergent pathways to furnish structurally diverse products. This methodology for N heterocycle synthesis provides a robust route to bioactive scaffolds. The synthetic utility of the approach is highlighted by the synthesis of two ion-channel antagonists.

I come from a long line of Luddites. My grandmother special-ordered her Toyota Camry with crank windows because she was convinced it was “one less thing that will break.” My father refused to upgrade our six-CD stereo system even though the eject button wouldn't open and it could only play the first CD he ever put in it. The Traveling Wilburys Vol.1 was the soundtrack to our family dinners for a decade. As for myself, I only switched to a smartphone in 2013, when it would've cost about the same amount to repair my flip phone.

Now I am the same as anyone reading this. My phone is my toy and my toil, the first object I touch upon waking, the spackle to my spare minutes, the inanimate partner in our shared lie, which is that it works for me and not the other way around. Mostly, I accept this. But with the latest iOS update, released last week, revolt is in the air.

I came home late from a holiday party, agreed to the latest iOS almost by accident, and woke up to a new world.

Tech companies are accustomed to a certain amount of kicking and screaming after foisting new interfaces on the public. You can't please all of the people all of the time, especially when “all of the people” is in the billions. But ask your friends—or Google or Reddit or Bluesky or ChatGPT—about the operating system update, and you will be swept away in a river of anger. “This is like foundationally bad,” author and musician John Darnielle replied on Bluesky to someone who agreed with his original tweet (about the poor photo-cropping function). One Reddit thread was posted under the headline “New iPhone update made me so overwhelmed, I ended up throwing my phone.” The subsequent post does not specify where the phone was thrown or at whom, but I have some suggestions. One wonders at what point a company's petrification of obsolescence risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Ask yourself: Is this good for the phones? Normally, I'd be curious about the hissy-fit metrics inside Silicon Valley, about when public upset gets severe enough to become private data. But right now, I have my own problems.

I downloaded Apple's new iOS 26.2 last week because I am a trained circus seal who will press any button presented to me. I came home late from a holiday party, agreed to the latest iOS almost by accident, and woke up to a new world. There's something very A Thief in the Night about any new operating system, but in this case, the complaints, some witnessed, some personally experienced, are intense. Here is a partial list: the slow speed (every action takes twice as long), the animation of text bubbles, the incongruous mix of sensitivity and imperviousness to touch, the swipes to nowhere, the difficulty posting downloaded photos, the fact that almost nothing is where you left it (search fields, files), the unsolicited status sharing regarding dwindling battery life (“24m to 80%”), the lack of visual contrast, the screenshot fussiness, the requirement that users drive up to a mansion on Long Island and whisper “Fidelio” in order to toggle off the “Liquid Glass” function. You have to admit: It's a little funny to get a transparency feature from a tech company.

Given my history, I tend to assume most technological snafus are my doing. I've tried to wind back what aspects of this iOS I can, assuming the veil of frustration will lift eventually. Ideally, I will not have to mentally downgrade this pricy device to a flip-phone. But in the meantime, the widespread nature of other people's indignation has given me a perverse sense of community.

Take this battery-life business. I work from home, a privileged charging position. Yet I too have noticed my battery leveling threats. The iOS seems self-aware: The lock screen photo now fades by default, in order to save power. You have to do some toggling if you want to gaze at your kids with the instantaneousness to which you are accustomed. Also, like all of Reddit, I do not take kindly to the idea that the solution to my woes is to turn off my device and turn it back on (have you tried looking for your shoes in the closet?). Or that I should check my storage. Ha! I have a year-old phone with enough storage to choke a horse. This is not because I'm directing independent films. It's because I like my photos and text exchanges where I like my martinis: in my hand. I'm a writer. Two of my favorite things in this world are transcripts and being right, on the spot.

You have to admit: It's a little funny to get a transparency feature from a tech company.

Alas, my trusty research assistant doesn't feel so trusty right now. The new iOS is like getting a present from the relative who knows you the least. Except worse because your phone knows you quite well. So when it presents you with the touchscreen version of an ill-fitting, bug-ridden, ugly sweater and says, “I saw this and thought of you,” it creates revulsion and frustration. People don't enjoy forking over data and dollars in exchange for annoyance, in exchange for having to sound, well, like Luddites.

Historically, Luddites were 19th-century textile workers who eschewed new machinery (partially for financial reasons), thus becoming symbolic of impotent resistance to progress. But is this progress? It doesn't feel like it. Believe me, there's no glory in identifying as inept. The modern Luddite is just as impatient as the rest of the population, just as concerned with wanting things to work well or, yes, better. Which makes me think twice about my grandmother and her car. I'm pretty sure the woman knew how to press a button. She didn't special-order crank windows because it was one less learning curve for her, she ordered them because it was one less learning curve for the machine. She would've gone with whatever was sure to work. All she wanted was for the fucking windows to open.

Director Adam Bhala Lough didn't set out to make a documentary about a digital simulacrum of Sam Altman.

But after about 100 days of texting and emailing the OpenAI CEO for an interview—with no response, he claims, and with financiers hounding him to make good on his original pitch—Lough was at his wit's end.

He'd exhausted just about every angle. “Once I reached that point, I gave up and I pivoted to gate-crashing OpenAI,” he says. Though he'd employed a similar tactic in his Emmy-nominated 2023 documentary Telemarketers—a chronicle of industry-wide corruption in the telemarketing business—it wasn't a filmmaking style he felt all that comfortable with. “It was a fortress. I was able to slip through the gate, and immediately security grabbed me and physically removed me from the premises.”

So begins Deepfaking Sam Altman, Lough's portrait of how AI is reshaping society and his quest to talk to the man behind it. When his original plan fell through he drew inspiration from Altman himself. “The Scarlett Johansson controversy erupted,” he says. In 2024, the actress publicly called out OpenAI for seeming to copy her voice for its new AI voice assistant Sky. “It was at that point where I got the idea to do the deepfake.” (In a May 2024 statement, Altman apologized to Johansson and said Sky's voice was “never intended to resemble” hers.)

What originally starts out as a simple voice clone balloons into a full deepfake of Altman called Sam Bot, which Lough travels to India to have created. This being a Lough film, though, nothing goes according to plan. Without spoiling too much, Sam Bot eventually becomes its own entity, and the film takes an even stranger—and revelatory—dive from there. “There's parallels between this movie and Terminator 2: Judgement Day, but there's none of the violence,” he says. Lough grew up during what he calls the “AI 1.0 era.” His obsession with James Cameron's Terminator 2 was a major influence on his craft.

Deepfaking Sam Altman, which is based partially on the New York Magazine story casting Sam Altman as the Oppenheimer of our age, features commentary from former OpenAI safety engineer Heidy Khlaaf, who tells Lough, “We're starting to see OpenAI dip its toes in military uses, and I cannot imagine something like Dall-E and ChatGPT being used for military assists. That really scares me, given how inaccurate those systems are.""

In response to a request for comment, OpenAI directed WIRED to its usage policy, which states that people cannot use its services for “weapons development, procurement, or use, including conventional weapons or [chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives].”

In some ways, Lough says he has a more positive viewpoint on AI than he did before filming the piece.

“I never expected Sam Bot to like, plead for its own life,” he says in the documentary, later admitting the deepfake had become “a friend.”

“I'm not this massive advocate now for AI. But it really made me think that we are very close to having real relationships between humans and AI. I know that some people do already, but in general, the everyday human will,” he tells WIRED. “If you're in a position where you don't have a choice, where you don't choose to be lonely, I think AI is a good thing. It can be helpful in that way. But we should not start replacing human beings with AI. That's where I draw the line.”

The film, produced with Hartbeat and Vox Media Studios, will have its theatrical premiere in New York City on January 16 and in Los Angeles on January 30 before expanding nationwide.

In late November, in a quiet corner of Devon, England, workers began adding a secret, light brown powder to water as they mixed up a special fluid that can store energy. They blended it with the utmost care, like some kind of giant protein shake, over the course of multiple weeks. Their goal was to achieve a mixture 2.5 times denser than water.

“It's quite a hands-on process. At bigger scales, we would automate it,” says Stephen Crosher, chief executive and co-founder of RheEnergise, a British energy-storage company. He emphasizes that the mineral-based fluid must flow easily. “You want it to be really runny.”

That's because, in the company's demonstration system, at a china clay mine near the city of Plymouth, this mystery liquid can now slosh down angled pipes connecting an upper container to a lower container 80 meters below. In the process, the fluid drives turbines to create electricity. Pumping the mixture back up at times when there's excess energy on the grid resets the whole system. It's a new take on an old energy-storage technology currently experiencing a renaissance: pumped hydro.

RheEnergise's demonstration plant is located in the southwest of England.

Pumped hydro first emerged in the late 19th century. During subsequent decades, countries including the US and UK built lots of large plants, though construction had waned by the 1990s. The tech was originally designed to complement fossil fuel power plants, making use of excess energy they produced. But today grid operators increasingly value pumped hydro plants as workhorses able to mediate highly variable wind and solar assets. They can fill in shortfalls in electricity generation or soak up surplus energy within minutes, and store it for short or long periods.

Currently, significant amounts of energy go to waste because there's no way to consume it at the moment of generation. The UK, for one, has squandered more than £1 billion ($1.32 billion) this year alone by turning off wind turbines due to lack of energy demand.

Pumped hydro plants could help to solve this problem but building them has often been expensive and difficult. RheEnergise's denser-than-water fluid means the firm can pack more potential energy into a smaller space and at lower elevations. To replicate the firm's 500 kilowatt (kW) demonstrator with a water-based version, for example, you'd need more than twice the volume of liquid they're using, and the upper reservoir would need to be elevated to 200 meters rather than 80.

Vast reservoirs and towering mountains, historically associated with pumped hydro projects, may no longer be essential. “In somewhere like the UK, we think there are probably 20–25 viable sites for traditional pumped hydro, whereas for us it's 6,500,” says Crosher. There could be hundreds of thousands of potential locations for the company's technology worldwide—if RheEnergise can prove it works as intended. The firm tells WIRED it generated the first power from the system this week. Should the results from these tests continue to satisfy, a commercial-scale 10 MW project could follow by 2028.

RheEnergise is just one example of how pumped hydro is evolving. “It's a really exciting time,” says Rebecca Ellis, senior energy policy manager at the International Hydropower Association (IHA), a nonprofit membership organization. The IHA estimates that 600 GW of pumped hydro projects are in the global pipeline. 8.4 GW was installed in 2024, she adds. One project that helped boost that total was the 3.6 GW pumped hydro plant in Fengning, China. It's the biggest such facility, in terms of power capacity, in the world.

Day in, day out, plants like this move water up hills and down hills on a gigantic scale—and with incredible power.

Inside RheEnergise's demonstration plant.

At Goldisthal in central Germany, an upper reservoir containing approximately 12 million cubic metres of water—enough to fill 4,800 Olympic swimming pools—is linked by a pumped hydro power station to a lower reservoir of nearly 19 million cubic meters. It has two 800-meter-long penstocks, slanting tubes connecting the reservoirs, and, at maximum power, a capacity of 1.06 GW.

“Goldisthal is our biggest power plant,” says René Kühne, head of energy company Vattenfall's pumped hydro fleet in Germany. If required, the facility could provide 1.06 GW of electricity for between eight and nine hours. In just 90 seconds, Goldisthal can switch from standstill to full generation. Water floods down each penstock at 100 cubic metres per second. The plant can alternate between generation mode and pumping mode in a matter of minutes, which means that instead of supplying 1.06 GW of energy to the grid, it can absorb that much power.

In Vattenfall's central control room, human operators aided by algorithms monitor the electricity grid, and the market, to judge whether their pumped hydro plants ought to be generating or pumping. Kühne adds that the frequency of alternating between these modes has gone up over time because of renewables' variability.

If you can get the response right, however, you can make a lot of money. On its website, Vattenfall describes pumped hydro as “highly profitable.” A paper published last month estimated the effect of rising renewables in Spain between now and 2050. With gradually decreasing electricity prices, higher variability, and less need to import electricity overall, the authors found that energy storage would be utilized 12 percent more in the future—and that a system combining renewables with pumped hydro energy storage would see its profits rise.

Pumped hydro could, in principle, work in lots of places around the world, says Rosie Madge, a systems engineer at Energy Systems Catapult, a nonprofit research and innovation center: “Most countries in the world do have geographies that are suitable for it.”

A report by Madge and colleagues, published in October, scored 11 countries in terms of their suitability for pumped hydro and other long-term energy storage tech. Two notoriously flat nations, Denmark and the Netherlands, fared poorly. But the others were all extremely well-suited to conventional pumped hydro and a few, including the UK, Australia, and China, were very well-suited to the high-density version. The scores were based partly on how ready and willing each country was to deploy the tech, and also on market conditions.

But even in that analysis, it was conventional pumped hydro that appeared most deployable overall—when compared to multiple other long-duration storage technologies including high-density pumped hydro, hydrogen, ammonia, metal air batteries, compressed air, and non-pumped-hydro gravity storage.

If you want to get into the pumped hydro game, though, first you have to build your infrastructure. And doing so on a conventionally large scale is hard.

In Australia, a truly massive pumped hydro project called Snowy 2.0 is currently under construction. It is an expansion of an existing pumped hydro system that utilizes lakes in the Snowy Mountains of southern Australia. While Goldisthal can provide a total of 8.5 gigawatt hours (GWh) of energy—its 1.06 GW capacity delivered over a maximum of 8.5 hours—Snowy 2.0 will offer an astonishing 350 GWh when completed.

However, Snowy 2.0 has been beset by delays and cost overruns. Work on the project involves constructing huge tunnels, totalling 27 km in length. But one of the tunnel boring machines deployed to dig them was stuck for several months in unexpectedly soft rock. It later became stuck again. Plus, the company behind the project, Snowy Hydro, and some of its contractors have been fined over several alleged incidents of pollution caused by construction activities. A 2024 report by the nongovernmental National Parks Association of New South Wales (NPA) claimed its officials had allegedly observed roughly a dozen environmental compliance failures from early 2022 to mid-2023.

In 2024, in response to the NPA report on its purported environmental performance, the company said: “Snowy Hydro takes its environmental compliance obligations very seriously and is committed to ensuring that the construction and operation of the Snowy 2.0 Project proceeds in a manner that is compliant with all applicable laws and approvals.”

Snowy 2.0 is currently due to complete in late 2028. Funded by taxpayers, it will swallow up much more than the original estimate of AUD$2 billion ($1.29 billion). The final bill will be at least six times that, likely ending up in the region of AUD$15–18 bn, according to Andrew Blakers of Australian National University. He calculates, though, that even at that price, Snowy 2.0 will cost roughly one Australian cent, per Australian, over its projected 150-year lifespan.

“If you want serious storage, you want pumped hydro,” he says, adding that the UK, for one, is currently “not serious” about pumped hydro and won't be until it constructs a 500 GWh system at Loch Ness in Scotland. Multiple firms are vying to install new pumped hydro infrastructure there, though these schemes have faced local opposition.

Construction headaches sometimes come up for pumped hydro projects, and other large-scale infrastructure schemes, partly because it's so difficult to know what's in the ground before you start digging, says Brian Minhinick, global hydropower practice leader at Mott MacDonald, an engineering consultancy. “I'd very much like it that it didn't happen,” he says. “We try to do our best.” Planning for various scenarios can help, as can using 3D models of pumped hydro projects to plan construction in detail. Workers can adjust those digital plans should they find unexpectedly hard or soft rock, for instance.

New machines have helped, too. “You can actually get drilling rigs that have three computer-controlled drill arms [operating] at the same time—to speed up the work,” adds Minhinick. They can, for example, simultaneously excavate multiple holes for packing explosives into, as part of drill-and-blast operations where tunnel-boring machines aren't the tool of choice.

The sheer scale of some pumped hydro projects is one of their key advantages. Blakers says that building really large pumped hydro projects is how a country can show it means business when it comes to energy storage.

But Crosher at RheEnergise makes another point. While large-scale, traditional pumped hydro has its place, the world needs climate solutions fast. His goal is to offer a version of pumped hydro that is much easier and quicker to deploy. “If you want solutions for the climate emergency and the energy transition, then [traditional] pumped hydro will do part of it, but they're too slow to do it all,” he says.

7/10

The Lovense Spinel has it all. This sex toy is actually a mini sex machine, and it had me oohing, aahing, and thanking my lucky stars that my job involves reviewing sex gadgets.

It's not just about the multiple attachments—one for G-spot stimulation, one for clitoral stimulation, and a vibrating dildo long enough to reach the anterior fornix erogenous zone (A-spot). Its suction cup allows it to be used on a variety of surfaces. It even heats up to body temperature, making it feel like the real deal. In other words, if you love penetration, the Spinel is the whole kit and caboodle.

I have never encountered a toy like the Spinel. It's crazy powerful, so much so that when you turn it on—before inserting it inside you—it's intimidating. Each of the three attachments has a stimulation role to fill, and they take that job very seriously. The straight dildo, with a 5.29-inch insertable shaft, not only heats from 103.1 degrees Fahrenheit to 109.2 degrees during use, but it will literally take you to pound town, if that's someplace you'd like to visit. It can go from 395 thrusts a minute to 1,460 when you activate turbo mode by holding down the button.

Lovense Spinel

Rating: 7/10

It made the experience very realistic to my needs: start slow, work my way up, then, if I'm feeling it, go for turbo. Admittedly, when you have the Spinel on turbo, you're likely to have flashbacks to when Carrie Bradshaw was subjected to such aggressive jack rabbit sex that she couldn't stand up straight at Charlotte's wedding. However, because the vaginal muscles create resistance when it's inside, turbo mode was quite pleasurable, especially because I used a lot of lube. You absolutely want to lube up for Spinel.

What's also great about this dildo is that you can slide on the clitoral stimulator, so while you're enjoying proper thrusting, at the speed and intensity you like—there are three levels and four patterns—your clitoris is also getting its fair share of stimulation.

When you're ready to swap out the heating dildo with its epic amount of thrusts per minute, you can then move on to the G-spot attachment. While some internal arms have a slight curve to stimulate the G-spot, this one has a far-reaching, deep curve to it, meaning if you've struggled to find your G-spot in the past, you can't miss it with this attachment. You can also slide on the clitoral stimulator here, too, if you're in the mood to hopefully score a blended orgasm.

Rating: 7/10

Like all Lovense products, the Spinel comes with an app that isn't difficult to use, but with all the options, including speed, intensity, and temperature, it became a little project to explore the different features each time I opened it. I don't often use a sex toy's app all that much, but for this toy, it makes sense. It would be uncomfortable to control it entirely by hand, so the app feels necessary. Just be prepared to take some time to learn how it all works.

The Spinel takes time to put together, figure out, and decide on not just attachments, but how you want to use them. It can be a handheld device, placed on a flat and secure surface to make use of the suction cup feature, or its handle can literally turn it into a gun-shaped dildo that you can use on yourself, although it's not particularly comfortable to hold, so it's best used with a partner.

When you use the suction cup, you'll want to explore different flat surfaces to ensure it's super-secure, to avoid a precarious situation. If you have roommates and thin walls, and don't want people hearing your sex toy doing its thing, that's also something to consider. While there's no shame here, you don't want to make other people uncomfortable with the sounds that transpire.

If you love a sex toy that's going to do the majority of the work for you, heats up, and has long battery life—it takes about 2.5 hours to charge, and offers about four hours of playtime—then the Spinel might be your next favorite toy. It's not cheap, but it's worth the splurge.

The Working Families Party said Thursday that it is putting out a specific recruitment call for people who are organizing against data centers in their communities to run for office.

The announcement comes amid a period of heightened political turmoil around data centers, as some high-profile Democrats wade into the fight. Earlier this week, three Democrats in the Senate sent letters seeking information from Big Tech companies about how data centers impact electricity bills, while senator Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont, became the first national politician to call for a moratorium on data center construction.

“We see our role as responding to what working families and working people are concerned about, what issues are keeping them up at night,” says Ravi Mangla, the national press secretary for the Working Families Party. “We would be ignoring the needs of our constituents if we were not responding to the issue of data centers and their impacts on communities.”

The Working Families Party was originally founded in New York in the late 1990s; it now has chapters in states across the country. While it (mostly) doesn't seat candidates independently, the progressive third party's endorsements and organizing power can carry real weight in the races where it chooses to get involved. It endorsed Zohran Mamdani in New York's mayoral race this year, as well as a string of other successful candidates.

Opposition to data centers has skyrocketed in some areas of the country over the past year, as tech companies have ramped up their investment in building out hundreds of facilities across the country. Polling from the outlet Heatmap released in September shows that less than half of Americans of all political persuasions would welcome a data center being built near where they live, while a recent survey from a private industry group shows that community opposition increased in the second quarter of this year, successfully stalling or stopping billions of dollars in data center development.

In many regions of the country, affordability issues—including rising electricity bills—are becoming tangled with other concerns around data centers, like worries over the climate and water impacts, or even noise from the centers themselves. Concern over data centers played a role in a number of midterm elections, including factoring into several races in Virginia, which has the highest concentration of data centers in the country and is facing rising demands for energy from more facilities projected to come online through the end of the decade. The political ripple around data centers has lasted beyond the midterms—and stretched beyond just Virginia. In the past week, officials in Chandler, Arizona voted 7-0 to reject a proposed data center in the city, despite high-profile lobbying from former senator Kyrsten Sinema, while voters in Georgia on Tuesday elected a newcomer to the state legislature who has promised legislation to make data centers “pay their fair share.”

Mangla says the Working Families Party decided to launch the recruitment effort after seeing how the issue played out in Virginia's elections, and after observing some of the intense local pushback around the country. “You can't fill a community center or a town hall just organically,” he says. “There are people who are clearly stepping up in their communities, organizing their neighbors, and leading the charge to push back against these data centers.”

The group, which earlier this year put out a similar call for working class candidates to run for office, is encouraging interested people to fill out a form that will be used to identify possible local candidates, who can then be connected to resources to help them launch a bid for office. While the form is open to anyone around the country, Mangla says that the group will concentrate its efforts on certain regions—northern Virginia, the upper Midwest, and the Southwest—that, he says, overlap with support for the Working Families Party, data center development, and the local ability the group has available to vet candidates. Mangla says that they hope to expand the focus to other areas with a lot of data center organizing, like Georgia, depending on interest.

Data centers have been around for years in Virginia. But this election “was the first time that [data centers have] really been talked about on the electoral trail,” says Lee Francis, the chief program and communications officer at the League of Conservation Voters's Virginia chapter. Much of the PAC's work in the 2025 midterms focused on data centers, including running an ad attacking the Republican incumbent in Virginia's 30th district on his track record of welcoming data centers to the area. (That district—which includes some of Loudoun County, one of the world's densest data center regions, and which went to Trump in 2024—flipped this year.)

“There's more public awareness and more public outrage on data centers than there ever has been,” says Francis. “More people are looking at their electric bill and trying to figure out why their rates keep going up. People are connecting the dots because of greater public awareness, because of more organized opposition to data centers.”

Nationally, the politics around data centers are in flux, as tech companies pour more money into building data centers to fuel the AI race—and as more opposition pops up in areas where they're being built. Some high-profile Democrats have shown support for the buildout in their states. In June, Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro welcomed a $20 billion announcement from Amazon in projects in the state, including two data centers, while California governor Gavin Newsom vetoed legislation in October that would introduce new water use reporting requirements for data centers. (He did sign a bill that tasks the state's Public Utilities Commission with investigating whether or not increased electric demand from data centers could shift onto ratepayers.)

But on Tuesday, Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren, Chris Van Hollen, and Richard Blumenthal sent letters to major data center developers and Big Tech companies, including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta. The letters seek information from the companies “in light of alarming reports that tech companies are passing on the costs of building and operating their data centers to ordinary Americans as A.I. data centers' energy usage has caused residential electricity bills to skyrocket in nearby communities.”

The same day, Sanders released a video calling for a moratorium on data center construction. A moratorium, Sanders said, “will give democracy a chance to catch up, and ensure that the benefits of technology work for all of us, not just the 1 percent.” On Wednesday, Sanders's team released a separate video that highlighted the climate and water impacts of data centers.

“The idea of Amazon as just a huge billion dollar company in the sky is no longer true,” says Mangla. “We're seeing their data centers invading and taking over our own communities. I think more than ever the presence of Big Tech is not just something that is limited to Silicon Valley …we're seeing it in all parts of our lives, and the negative impacts that are coming from a tech industry that doesn't want to be regulated.”

The issue may become troublesome for some national Republicans, as the Trump administration puts its full weight of support behind the AI industry and data center development. (Recently, Trump issued an executive order threatening to punish states seeking to regulate AI.) Opposition to data centers has flared in red districts, and some MAGA politicians—including senator Josh Hawley and representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie—have criticized the national buildout for months. Earlier this month, Florida governor Ron deSantis called for limits on data centers in Florida as part of a bill that could regulate AI in the state.

“A lot of the opposition to these projects is led locally in rural areas,” says Francis. “There aren't folks showing up in Birkenstocks at these public hearings. They're local folks who have to live next to them. That's been a lot of the opposition. It's not necessarily a super climate activist type of thing.”

While the Working Families Party overwhelmingly aligns with Democratic candidates, the group says it has supported Republican candidates in the past. The recruitment call, Mangla stresses, is open to candidates of all political persuasions organizing against data centers.

Credit the Pink Pony Club. Until early October, I was happy with my prepaid phone service. I moved my cell service to budget prepaid plans nearly a decade ago, and have gone through a half-dozen services since, including Mint and Boost.

Then I took my 10-year-old daughter to see a Chappell Roan concert. My phone was on Visible Wireless at the time, and my traffic was fully deprioritized at an event where seemingly 30,000 people were simultaneously posting stories and snaps ahead of me. I ended up standing in a field for four hours without a drop of internet.

T-Mobile recently announced a new service that lets you switch to the carrier in just 15 minutes, along with same-day delivery of your new smartphone. That was very appealing, as was the idea of not being tossed to the back of the line the next time I wanted to use my phone at a crowded event. I expected better coverage and was hopeful about an easy switch, so I gave it a whirl.

As someone who goes through multiple cheap prepaid carriers every few years, I'm used to battling my cell service provider. I've spent hours and hours trying to port my lines or get a device I paid cash for unlocked so I could use it overseas (there's a reason why we only recommend you buy unlocked smartphones). I have been pushed past the brink of Karendom and even resorted to filing an FCC complaint over one carrier's practices. I have consistently been frustrated with the difficulty of switching carriers and have come to believe it's painful by design.

T-Mobile's new 15-minute switching feature only works if you use the carrier's app, and I wanted to discuss my options, so I called. The switching process took a little longer over the phone (27 minutes), but it was painless. The T-Mobile sales rep wasn't pushy with the upsells and was able to use a screen-mirroring function on the app to point me to where to click or read. I found it helpful, and it's the only way I would advise an older person like my mom to interact with a cell carrier.

I opted for the mid-tier Experience More plan, which, for $85 per month, offers unlimited data and calling, plus 60 gigs of high-speed mobile hotspot data, and some free data in Canada, Mexico, and several other countries. Also, I can text and use the internet on a plane. It comes with free Netflix, too.

My iPhone 15 Pro Max had a cracked screen for almost a year after I dropped it at an NFL playoff game (it was in a case at the time, and I hate cases), so I was ready for a new device. That bright orange iPhone 17 Pro has been calling my name. I was ineligible for a trade-in given the condition of my old phone, so I looked at what promotions the carrier was offering.

T-Mobile is currently offering the regular iPhone 17 for free with a 2-year contract. I didn't want the regular model, but was happy to learn that the carrier can take that same $35 per month and apply it to the Pro Max, meaning I got the device I wanted for $15 per month over the 2-year contract. I was facing a $32 increase in switching from Visible, but got $35 in monthly device credits with no interest, meaning I'm actually getting back $3 per month. The next time I'm at a concert, I'll be able to scroll through Threads between sets like a normal person and maybe even post a few selfies.

T-Mobile's other big boast is same-day delivery on your device. Unfortunately, while I could have gotten this with the standard iPhone 17 or the regular iPhone 17 Pro, same-day delivery wasn't available for the Pro Max in orange in my area (especially considering I finished my order around 6 pm). Instead, I arranged for next-day pickup from a local T-Mobile store. By the time I checked my email the next morning, the phone was ready for pickup. I drove 1.2 miles to the T-Mobile store, showed them my driver's license, and was home within 15 minutes. Then I had to set up my new phone and port my number. All told, I had less than an hour of my time sunk into the switch.

While the particulars of my situation made it so the whole process wasn't purely 15 minutes with same-day delivery, I'm happy to report the switchover process was one of the most pain-free experiences I've had with a carrier. Also, apparently, I can now get a free Slurpee from 7/11 every month as part of the promotion.

                                What happens here matters everywhere

What happens if you let teens craft the rules that dictate their use of phones at school? You get policy ideas with a nuanced, holistic perspective that rival those being officially issued by the adults in leadership.

The University of Washington's Youth Advisory Board, a group of approximately 20 teens from Seattle-area schools, recently published its first memo tackling this contentious issue. The memo weighs the pros and cons of phone bans and offers recommendations on how schools should draft and communicate their policies.

“The whole point of the memo was to bring teen experiences into real policy conversations,” said Jaden Hong, a sophomore at Eastlake High School and board participant. “I think it matters that our ideas get into the hands of the principals, district leaders and even state-level decision makers or legislators who are actively shaping phone and tech rules.”

The Youth Advisory Board's memo was informed by a UW study and questionnaires on the impacts of phone rules at middle and high schools in Washington. The regulations ranged from all-day bans to restrictions during lunch and passing periods. The board's key suggestions for high school policies include:

Lucía Magis-Weinberg, a developmental psychologist and head of the International Adolescent Connection and Technology Laboratory at the UW, conducted the surveys that helped inform the students' opinions. Roughly 4,400 students, teachers and parents responded to the initial inquiry. 

In the answers to questionnaires, teachers emphasized that with limited phone access, there are fewer distractions in the classroom, more social engagement and less bullying. Teens said the restrictions reduced the amount of cheating.

On the downside, teens and parents were concerned that communications were more difficult, such as friends making plans, scheduling with family, or in the case of an emergency. Teens and teachers noted that phones had positive instructional uses and could aid students with specific academic or language challenges.

“As a student, sometimes it's hard to look outside of yourself,” said Abbie Huang, a board participant who also attends Eastlake. She said that reading teachers' comments on student engagement and realizing that a lot of students are OK with phone restrictions broadened her opinion.

“It was really cool to see other schools and the way they approached it, and just other people's perspectives that I didn't think about before,” she added.

The Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction allows local districts to set their own phone policies. The office reported that 75% of the state's districts were implementing restrictions — either banning phones during class time or throughout the school day.

Oregon, by contrast, took a statewide approach, prohibiting phone use during school hours in the state's K-12 public schools.

Seattle Public Schools has not issued a district-wide policy, though at least three public middle schools in the district have banned phones at school, and at least one high school prohibits their use during classes.  

UW researchers shared the Youth Advisory Board's memo at last week's Washington Educational Research Association conference in Tacoma.

Board participants agreed that student input is equally crucial for other pressing tech issues, including rising teen use of artificial intelligence and chatbots, as well as ongoing concerns about social media's impact on young people.

“I really want to highlight how important it is to get the youth voice in there,” said Rotem Landesman, a UW graduate student in the Information School helping lead the Youth Advisory Board. Teens need to be represented in drafting policies and guidelines, she added, as tech is being integrated into schools “at such a rapid pace.”

Recent data from the Pew Research Center highlights the challenge:

For both AI and social media, experts worry about mental health harms, misinformation, privacy and other concerns — while regulating the technology's use remains difficult.

Sirjana Kaur, a senior at Redmond High School and board participant, said that her AP literature course forbids the use of AI due to concerns about cheating, requiring students to do all of their writing longhand and in class. The year-end AP test, which potentially provides students with college credits, will be done on a computer.

“There's definitely a lot of work” to be done around AI regulations, she said. “I think there's a balance that needs to be struck between avoiding AI, but also not making things even harder for students.”

Amazon is quietly rolling out the last big pillar of its AI-powered Alexa+ vision: the Alexa.com website, bridging the gap between its Echo devices, mobile app, and consumer desktops.

The web portal means users can now interact with Alexa through a keyboard and mouse: accessing and continuing past Alexa chats, starting new ones, going back and forth between voice conversations in the living room and typed chats in the home office, etc. 

(Alexa.com is available initially to a subset users in the Alexa+ early access program, with access likely to expand in the coming weeks, so if you're not seeing it yet, stay tuned.)

I've been trying it out, and I'm already finding it quite useful as an extension of the Alexa experience. In addition to expanding the chat functionality to the browser, the web interface offers fine-grained control over reminders, calendar appointments, uploaded files, and smart home devices. 

For example, I was able to edit a family reminder: changing the assigned person, adjusting the date and time, setting it to repeat weekly, and adding a flag for Alexa to follow up until it's complete. All of this happened through simple clicks, much easier than talking Alexa through the details, in my experience.

The rollout of Alexa+ earlier this year also introduced the ability to email or upload documents to Alexa for summarization and reference. This made Alexa a lot more useful on its own. Now, with the online portal, it's much easier to upload, access and delete files.

There's also some nice smart home integration, with the ability to control lights and plugs, for example. It's similar to the Alexa app, but nice to be able to access on the computer. 

In short, it's a level of point-and-click precision that voice commands and the mobile app can't offer. Within a few minutes of using Alexa.com, I had this sense of liberation, being able to interact with Alexa in the same way as anything else on the computer. What a concept! 

That said, I couldn't help but wonder how much I'll actually use it.

Three years after the launch of ChatGPT, my AI routines have become relatively entrenched. I'm having a hard time envisioning going to Alexa.com on my computer to start a chat rather than Gemini, NotebookLM, Claude, Perplexity or other AI tools that have become daily habits. 

Then again, for me, those tools are about work and individual tasks. Alexa is really the digital hub for my family. The introduction of better AI with Alexa+ has improved that experience over the past few months, and the web portal adds a whole new dimension. Family is why I'll use it.

The Alexa+ integration goes even further for me since I've been talking to Alexa more and more via my Amazon Echo Buds on my phone when I'm out and about, although this is probably more illustrative of me being an edge case than anything else.

Within Amazon, Alexa+ sits at the top of the AI stack that Amazon CEO Andy Jassy talks about. It's the consumer-facing layer for a company that has made a much bigger mark in AI with its cloud infrastructure and platforms. Alexa's web launch fills a gap that's been glaring for a while.

One thing I'd like to see is true Ring integration into the web experience — the ability to see and access smart home cameras from Alexa.com in addition to the existing Ring.com interface. 

The more Amazon can unify everything inside the web portal, the more useful it will be. No doubt I'll come up with other feature requests as I continue to use it. 

But for now, the simple act of using an AI-powered Alexa in a web browser is so mind-blowing, in such a basic way, that it's hard not to wonder how much further along Amazon would be in the world of consumer AI if it had been able to make this happen a long time ago.

Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin space venture has delayed the first flight of a wheelchair user into space due to a technical issue that came to light just before today's scheduled launch.

The countdown for Blue Origin's suborbital New Shepard mission was terminated nearly an hour after the  launch window opened at 10 a.m. CT (8 a.m. PT) at Blue Origin's Launch Site One in West Texas. Blue Origin didn't specify the nature of the glitch. Launch commentator Tabitha Lukin said only that the flight team “observed an issue with our built-in checks prior to flight.”

“We are assessing our next opportunity for launch,” she said. 

This will be the 37th New Shepard mission, and the 16th to carry humans on a brief ride above the 100-kilometer (62-mile) altitude level that marks the internationally accepted boundary of space. Eighty people have previously flown on New Shepard, including Bezos. Six have gone multiple times.

The six-person crew for the mission, known as NS-37, includes Michaela “Michi” Benthaus, a German-born aerospace and mechatronics engineer at the European Space Agency who sustained a spinal cord injury in a mountain biking accident in 2018.

In a 2023 interview published by the Technical University of Munich, Benthaus said that she's always been “mega fascinated” by space, and set her mind on becoming an astronaut when she was 10 years old.

When Benthaus lost the use of her legs, she initially thought her flight into space “was never going to happen.” But in 2022, her hopes got a big boost when she experienced a zero-G flight arranged through AstroAccess, a project that's dedicated to paving the way for spacefliers with disabilities. Last year, she was the commander of an analog space mission conducted at the Lunares Research Station in Poland. 

Now the 33-year-old is on the verge of blazing a new trail for space access. 

“This feels like an important step, since space travel for people with disabilities is still in its very early days,” Benthaus said in a LinkedIn post. “I'm so thankful and hope it inspires a change in mindset across the space industry, creating more opportunities for people like me. I might be the first — but have no intention of being the last.”

Blue Origin has been working for several years to improve accessibility at its New Shepard facilities — for example, by adding an elevator to the seven-story launch tower. A business resource group named New Hawking, in honor of the late wheelchair-using physicist Stephen Hawking, has helped lead the way.

During their flight, Benthaus and the rest of the NS-37 crew will experience a few minutes of zero-gravity and views of a curving Earth against the blackness of space. At the end of the ride, the booster will make an autonomous landing while the crew capsule descends to a parachute-assisted touchdown in the West Texas desert.

Benthaus' crewmates include:

In addition to the crew, NS-37 will be carrying more than 20,000 postcards submitted by students and others through a program organized by the Club for the Future, Blue Origin's nonprofit educational foundation. The featured partners for this latest batch of postcards are UNIQLO, Arm & Hammer Baking Soda Rocket Day and Give Kids the World Village.

Blue Origin typically doesn't reveal how much people pay to take trips on New Shepard. In some cases, crew members have flown as invited guests. On the other end of the spectrum, crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun paid $28 million for a ticket in a widely publicized auction.

The suborbital space program's previous milestones include flying the world's oldest spaceflier (former test pilot Ed Dwight, who was 90 when he rode on New Shepard last year); the world's youngest spaceflier (Oliver Daemen, who was 18 when he flew with Bezos and two others in 2021). and the first married couple to reach the final frontier together on a commercial spaceship (Marc and Sharon Hagle in 2022).

Tin Can is answering the call from investors.

The Seattle startup behind a landline-style, Wi-Fi-enabled telephone for kids raised $12 million in new funding, the company announced Thursday.

The seed round was led by Greylock Partners with participation from Lateralus Holdings and existing backers. Tin Can previously raised $3.5 million in pre-seed funding in September from PSL Ventures, Newfund Capital, Mother Ventures, and Solid Foundations.

Tin Can's colorful screen- and text-free phones aim to help kids connect without the pressures and addictive pull of the digital world. The devices operate on a private network and include a companion app and modern safeguards.

Since launching its flagship product earlier this year, Tin Can quickly went “viral,” sold out its first two production runs and built a near-six-figure waitlist. The momentum comes amid growing concern about the effects of smartphones and social media on kids' mental health, attention and development.

Co-founder and CEO Chet Kittleson told GeekWire that his team is “pretty elated” to attract investors who are also parents, who care about what Tin Can is building and want to help the company keep pace with demand.

“They really care about us and about the customer and about the world that we want to see, and they're also really technically proficient,” Kittleson said about David Shuman, founder of Lateralus Holdings, and Mike Duboe, general partner at Greylock.

“Mike is like a growth machine. He was head of growth at Stitch Fix for a long time,” Kittleson said. “And David just knows everything you could ever want to know about supply chain and manufacturing, and cash flow. He's already helped us a million different ways.”

Duboe said in a news release that Tin Can isn't just building a product; they're leading a movement.

“In an age defined by digital noise, they've created a joyful alternative that redefines how we view modern connection,” he said. 

Kittleson, along with co-founders Graeme Davies and Max Blumen, previously worked at Seattle real estate startup Far Homes. He was recognized this month as one of GeekWire's six “Uncommon Thinkers,” honoring innovators driving positive change in the world.

“I'm so grateful that this is the hit, that it worked,” Kittleson said in a GeekWire profile tied to the honor.

Tin Can employs 17 people and is “growing at a pretty fun clip,” Kittleson said.

The startup plans to use the new funding to scale production, add engineers and customer support, and prepare for international expansion.

Swedish vibe-coding startup Lovable has more than tripled its valuation in just five months.

Stockholm-based Lovable on Thursday said it had raised $330 million in a Series B funding round that was led by CapitalG and Menlo Ventures, at a $6.6 billion valuation. Khosla Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, and Databricks Ventures also participated, as did other investors.

This raise comes mere months after Lovable raised a $200 million Series A round that valued the company at $1.8 billion in July.

One of the quickest to capitalize on the AI boom, Lovable has built a “vibe-coding” tool that lets people use text prompts to write code and build complete apps. The company launched in 2024, and has grown blazing fast: It reached the vaunted $100 million ARR milestone within eight months, and just four months later, doubled that to surpass $200 million in annual recurring revenue.

The company counts major software names like Klarna, Uber, and Zendesk as customers, and claims that more than 100,000 new projects are built on its platform every day, and more than 25 million projects were created in its first year.

Lovable said it would use the new funding for building deeper integrations with third-party apps, expanding its features for enterprise use-cases, and to flesh out its platform with the infrastructure needed — like databases, payments, and hosting — to build full-fledged applications and services.

Lovable co-founder and CEO Anton Osika said onstage at this year's Slush conference in Helsinki, Finland that he credits the company's ability to scale to his decision to ignore calls from investors to relocate the company to Silicon Valley.

“It was tempting, but I really resisted that,” Osika said onstage at the November conference. “I [can] sit here now and say, ‘Look, guys, you can build a global AI company from this country.' There is more available talent if you have a strong mission, and you have a lot of urgency coming together as a group and working.”

In November, the company was called out for not paying VAT, a tax that applies to most goods and services in the European Union (EU). Osika confirmed that this was true in a LinkedIn post, saying that the company would remedy the situation, and shut down comments saying taxes like this are why the EU isn't a good home for high-growth startups.

Vibe coding continues to be a hot area of investing for VCs. Cursor, another vibe-coding darling, raised $2.3 billion in November at a $29.3 billion valuation. Like Lovable, this was also the company's second funding round of the year, seeing its valuation double between June and November.

TechCrunch reached out to Lovable for any additional information.

Apple announced it will allow alternative app stores in Japan and will permit developers to process payments for digital goods and services outside of its own in-app purchase system in iOS. The iPhone maker is not making these changes because it wants to be more open; it's being forced — in this case, to comply with the country's Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA), which is now going into effect.

With this update, Apple's App Store revenues are being impacted in another major market due to anticompetition laws and regulations. The company already has to comply with Europe's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which previously required the tech giant to allow for alternative app stores and other changes.

In the U.S., Apple has been strong-armed into changing its in-payments system by way of the courts, after a lawsuit from Fortnite maker, Epic Games. Though it was not declared a monopoly, the court decided Apple needed to give developers the right to process payments outside of its system if they chose. (The specifics around that order are still being worked out after an appeal partially reversed an earlier ruling.)

As usual, in its announcement about the changes in Japan, Apple warned that alternative app marketplaces and payments open “new avenues for malware, fraud, scams, and privacy and security risks.” To mitigate those risks, the company said it worked with Japanese regulators to require an authorization process for app marketplaces (“Notarization”), which it says is designed to protect children specifically from inappropriate content and scams.

The fact that Apple has come up with a process to dial back the risk for alternative app stores indicates there has always been a technical solution at hand to balance the needs for both openness and security.

As in the EU, Apple has come up with a complex fee structure to ensure it doesn't lose much in the form of App Store revenue, while seemingly complying with the letter of the law.

Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, of course, was not silent on this matter, saying Fortnite will still not return to iOS in Japan because Apple is charging a 21% fee on third-party in-app purchases.

In a post on X, he wrote, “Apple was required to open up iOS to competing stores today, and instead of doing so honestly, they have launched another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking in gross disrespect to the government and people of Japan. Apple chose poorly. Again.”

Sadly, Fortnite will not return to iOS in Japan in 2025 as promised. Apple was required to open up iOS to competing stores today, and instead of doing so honestly, they have launched another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking in gross disrespect to the government and people… pic.twitter.com/7hu5eGMQX6

He also pointed out the difference between Apple and other game store providers, like Microsoft, by asking, “Can you imagine the gamer and regulator uproar that would ensue if Microsoft required all games from Steam and Epic Games Store to call its commerce surveillance API and report all transactions back to Microsoft?”

“That's what Apple just announced in Japan,” he added. 

Apple noted that developers will need to agree to the latest update to the Apple Developer Program License Agreement, which includes the new options for Japan, by March 17, 2026.

Rivian's new second-generation R1 EVs are receiving an update today that brings the new “Universal Hands-Free” driving software, which the company revealed last week at its first-ever “Autonomy & AI Day.”

The company says the new feature allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel on more than 3.5 million miles of roads in the United States and Canada, including a mix of highways and surface streets, as long as there are visible lane lines. 

Owners will still have to supervise the driving system and, crucially, it “will not stop or slow down for traffic lights or stop signs.” Universal Hands-Free will also not make turns or follow navigation. (Rivian says the software will re-engage if a driver uses their turn signal and handles the turn manually.)

It's an important step forward for the company, which is aiming to make its vehicles capable of full autonomy over the next few years. But it also comes with risk: Rival automakers with similar systems like Tesla and Ford have dealt with multiple crashes and deaths, many related to drivers' attention straying from the driver assistance systems. Those crashes have led to investigations and lawsuits.

The updated software greatly expands the driver assistance capabilities that were previously available to Rivian owners. Before the update, Rivian's hands-free driving system only worked on 135,000 miles of highways. Rivian detailed plans at last week's event to eventually allow its vehicles to drive themselves from “point-to-point,” though that feature will not ship until 2026. 

Rivian is developing a new autonomy computer with custom silicon for its R2 SUV (which debuts in 2026) that, combined with a roof-mounted lidar sensor, will be capable of one day making the company's vehicles fully autonomous, CEO RJ Scaringe said last week. 

The software update released Thursday brings a few other features not related to Rivian's driver assistance system. There's a new version of its digital key that owners of second-generation R1 vehicles can add to digital wallets on iPhones, Apple Watches, Google Pixels, and Samsung phones. Owners of quad-motor variants of the Gen 2 R1 EVs are also getting the long-teased “Kick Turn” feature, as well as the “RAD Tuner” customizable drive modes.

DXS International, a U.K.-based company that provides healthcare tech for England's National Health Service (NHS), disclosed a cyberattack in a statement on Thursday.

In a filing with the London Stock Exchange, the company said it experienced a “a security incident affecting its office servers,” discovered on December 14. The company said it “immediately” contained the breach working together with the NHS, and hired a cybersecurity firm to investigate “the nature and extent of the incident.”

“There was minimal impact on the company's services and the company's front-line clinical services remain unaffected and operational,” read the filing.

At this point, the specific nature of the breach is not known, nor whether any patients' medical information was stolen. 

However, earlier this week, a ransomware group called DevMan took credit for the breach. In a post on its dark web site, which TechCrunch has seen, the hackers listed the company on December 14 and claimed to have stolen 300 gigabytes of data from the company.

DXS said it also notified law enforcement and regulators, including the UK's data protection authority, the Information Commissioner's Office, or ICO, about the cyberattack.

DXS chief operating officer Steven Bauer did not respond to a series of questions. Instead, Bauer sent TechCrunch a statement echoing the public filing. 

Rashana Sweidan Vigerstaff, a spokesperson for the ICO, told TechCrunch that the ICO is assessing the information provided by DXS, while also not responding to several questions.   

NHS England spokesperson Katie Baldwin told TechCrunch that the health service is “not aware of any patient services being impacted.”

On its website, DXS says it provides software that helps to reduce costs for doctors and primary care physicians. As such, the company's software touches patient records and data. The company also says that in some cases, its solutions are hosted on the NHS' Health and Social Care Network (HSCN), which is a system for healthcare organizations across the U.K. to access and share information. 

Generally speaking, the NHS does not store patient's medical data in a centralized system.

Ethereal Exploration Guild, an Indian spacetech startup better known as EtherealX — developing a fully reusable medium-lift launch vehicle — is close to securing about $21 million in a new funding round co-led by TDK Ventures, with Accel among the participants, TechCrunch has learned.

Initially planned as a $15 million Series A, the round has drawn strong investor demand and is now expected to reach about $20.5 million, three people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The funding comes more than a year after the startup raised a $5 million seed round in August 2024.

TDK Ventures is co-leading the round with Vietnam-based venture capital firm BIG Capital, with Accel also participating, the sources said.

The funding talks follow EtherealX securing $130 million worth of contracts from six customers, the sources told TechCrunch, underscoring early commercial demand for its launch services.

Founded in 2022 by Manu J. Nair alongside former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) scientist Shubhayu Sardar, who serves as chief operating officer, and aerospace engineer Prashant Sharma, the chief technology officer, EtherealX is aiming to take on SpaceX with a medium-lift launch vehicle called Razor Crest Mk-1. The rocket, designed to be fully reusable, is expected to place up to eight tonnes into low Earth orbit and will also be capable of delivering payloads to geostationary transfer and trans-lunar injection orbits.

The Bengaluru-based startup says its launch system will offer cost efficiencies to customers while helping to address a global shortage of launch capacity, with a first launch targeted for early 2027.

In an interview with TechCrunch last year, Nair said EtherealX's rocket could offer launch prices ranging from about $350 to $2,000 per kilogram. By comparison, SpaceX's Falcon 9 typically charges between $1,600 and $2,000 per kilogram.

“At the price point at which we will enter the market, we'll comfortably capture 30% to 40% of it,” Nair said at the time.

India has emerged as one of the few countries globally with a geographic and regulatory advantage for space launches, offering access to multiple orbital inclinations from a single launch site. Its growing spacetech ecosystem is also attracting global investors seeking markets that can complement space development in the United States, Europe, and other key regions.

EtherealX has secured 16 acres of land in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, which it plans to make operational early next year. The startup has also been developing key components, including a liquid oxygen (LOX) turbopump assembly for its upper-stage engine, known as Pegasus 2.0, according to a recent LinkedIn post by Nair last week.

India is aiming to dramatically expand its footprint in the global commercial space industry, targeting an 8% to 10% market share over the next decade from less than 2% today, with much of that growth expected to be driven by private startups. The country is working toward a $40 billion to $45 billion space economy within the next eight to 10 years, Indian Space Minister Jitendra Singh said recently.

Nair declined to comment. TDK Ventures, Accel, and BIG Capital did not respond to requests for comment.

According to Reuters, Instacart is currently getting the regulatory equivalent of a throat-clearing from the FTC, which has sent the grocery delivery platform a civil investigative demand regarding its AI-powered pricing tool, Eversight. Put another way, the agency wants to know why some people are paying substantially more for their organic granola than others.

The issue came to light after a study revealed that shoppers are seeing fairly different prices for identical groceries from the same stores — up to 23% higher prices in some cases. Instacart says these price tests were randomized, not tied to an algorithm that targets customers based on their browsing history. But when people are already anxious about affording eggs, that distinction probably doesn't mean much.

Dynamic pricing isn't new or necessarily nefarious. Harvard Business School will tell you it's how digital platforms stay competitive. Airlines use it, hotels use it, Uber famously uses it. Companies argue that it helps balance supply and demand, maximizes profitability, and creates win-win scenarios.

But there's a difference between paying surge pricing for a ride home from the bar and paying extra for groceries (food isn't optional). So while the investigation doesn't prove wrongdoing, it's hardly shocking that the FTC — which has investigated data-driven pricing strategies by other companies — is reportedly asking questions. In an economy where everyone's feeling squeezed, AI-driven price testing of kitchen essentials was bound to attract attention.

For its part, Instacart says the market misunderstands this particular initiative. “Much of what's been reported has mischaracterized how pricing works on Instacart,” a spokesperson for the company tells TechCrunch. “First, our retail partners control their pricing strategies, and we work with them to align their online and in-store pricing wherever possible. Second, these tests are not dynamic pricing nor surveillance pricing – prices on Instacart do not change in real time nor are they based on supply or demand, and we never use personal, demographic, or user-level behavioral data to set item prices. These tests are a form of randomized A/B testing, similar to the way retailers have long run pricing tests between different stores.”

The issue of airbnb is a sticky one. On one hand, being able to temporarily live in an apartment greatly enhances the immersiveness when your travel - you get to feel like a local and experience life in another place. Hotels suck as they cut corners to the point where an article posted here complaining about the lack of bathroom doors in hotels. On the other hand, these rentals drive up real estate prices and drives out locals. And often these rentals are in run-down low-income turning affordable yet poor quality housing into high quality temporary rentals. This drives out low income residents deepening income inequality issues while subjecting them to the threat of homelessness.As long as we tolerate a society that only values ROI while ignoring the value of investing in humanity we won't resolve any of these issues. In a better world we would think about others and realize that easy access to shelter is foundational to stabilizing people to enable them to succeed in life. It's not hard, we have an abundance of materials and labor yet we have built a culture where helping others is some form of weakness for both parties.

Yes, if your local life is being inconsiderate and having parties till 3 because you're on holidays. Having an airbnb in your building is terrible as you don't know the people and they don't care about getting to know you.> Hotels suck as they cut corners to the point where an article posted here complaining about the lack of bathroom doors in hotels.The great thing about hotels is that they can be planned for and zoned correctly for. Even so, I've had a hotel go up 100m from my apartment and had to invest in blackout blinds since they chose for a modern design with glass all over (and the lights are bright at night).The biggest problem here in Barcelona is that most airbnbs / short term rentals are companies buying housing as an investment and so are stealing the opportunity from actual people and families trying to live.

This problem exists regardless of who does the buying. Where I live the locals got into the market first. Still, it's a zero-sum game, every short-term rental is a house a family cannot live in and probably cannot afford to buy.On my street 30% of the houses are short-term rentals. Some rent out for $10k/week just 8 weeks a year and are closed up the rest of the time. My daughter is currently the only kid on the street, which has over 100 houses.Not only are all the houses now priced as income-producing investments, they are killing the community that used to exist here.

reply

Certainly, there is a tug of war between tourist dollars vs negative tourist impact, but this math is a function of how impactful tourist decline (if any) would occur by pushing out short term rentals. Hotels always remain an option. Real estate and politics are local, as the sayings go. AirBnB pushed negative externalities on local jurisdictions to achieve their valuation and economic success (""socialize the losses, privatize the gains""), and these efforts are just pushing them back in some form. Tourists should remember that they are guests in the places that host them, and it is a privilege to be hosted.

If you share a wall or ceiling or are next door to one, how small would the minority have to be to keep you from being annoyed?

That's exactly what we're not tolerating here in Spain. We have guaranteed right to ""decent and adequate housing"" enshrined in the constitution, which is why you're seeing these aggressive moves against companies that actively work against us having that.I guess we in Spain are a bit of guinea pigs regarding this, as we've been hit hard by Airbnb et al, but we also have strong social movements trying to fight back, and right now being a bit successful. Gonna be interesting to see how it looks like in 5-10 years again, once we start to see the effect of the new laws passed these last few years.

Across the street lies a hotel, a true tourist trap. They have a 6/10 rating on booking and rely on scamming British tourists, whom you can see balancing drunk on their balconies daily. It's owned by a national conglomerate. 
As you may guess, as of now the airbnbs are closed and the hotel is thriving despite only bringing the worst kind of tourist to the community. 
An astute observer will note that the hotel industry is one of the biggest lobbyists supporting the current government at a national level. 
I am not one to defend big companies, but for some people here Airbnb was freedom. Now they have to go work cleaning rooms or just collect retirement checks, as obtaining a license to run a hotel is impossible without political connections / corruption. 
My point is, not everywhere are laws as fair as in the United States. 
Before someone talks about housing pressure, this is a relatively out of the way area where 40% of houses sit empty most of the year.

If the economics work out for landlords, a city can lose a lot of apartments to short term rentals way faster than it could increase supply. Especially in central districts where significant new construction is barely possible.

The “right to housing” is a joke when the US essentially makes it illegal to build new units in most areas.Because of that restriction, rent control causes the small number of limited units to be subsided by everyone else paying more, as basic supply and demand dictates

You are applying a viewpoint which is not universally applicable, nor is it static where it does apply.If you accept that housing is not market in which all parties have equal leverage to bargain, then you should also accept that regulating it to be more fair is not bad by definition.We happened to regulate it in ways that were counterproductive previously, but the regulation itself is not guaranteed to always be counterproductive, unless you believe that discrepancies in leverage cannot be mitigated by regulation while the lack of leverage itself is being created partially by other regulation.

I think rent control advocates focus on people who might be lucky enough to get a rent controlled apartment, but it is much harder to think about what happens to all the people who want to move to a city but can't because no housing stock is available.

Problem is that it's in areas where people don't want to live. In the areas people want to live, the problem is the opposite, there isn't nearly enough housing, so you end up with some of the highest population densities in EU (#2 and #3 are both in Spain at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_Union_cities_... in ""density per km2"" for example, 50% of top 10 on that list is in Spain!) and prices keep going up.Add in that salaries are pretty low so cost of living is subsequently low, so you end up with a ton of ""expats"" and other fun folks like ""foreign investors"" who purchase up all the livable/rentable properties with their ""higher value"" money, because everything is so cheap for them.Owners realize this, and while the government is (now at least) trying to put a stop to all of this with limiting rent increases and more, owners still try to take advantage of it as much as they can.Personally, I think we need to temporarily put a complete halt to non-residents buying any sort of properties or even land here, at least for a short period of time so the people who actually live and work here can recover from the situation.For the average person with a normal job here and not working for foreign companies with a higher salary, it's short of impossible to be able to afford to eventually buy a house.

This is a big generalization but I think it's broadly true.If you are in a ""resource"" area you'll get pollution and often instability and war.If you are in a ""playground"" area you get massive cost increases and are eventually forced out.As the trend is toward concentrating more and more wealth at the top, the slice of rich who can afford to enjoy the playgrounds becomes smaller and the number of refugees, homeless, and poor becomes larger and poorer.

That list does not make much sense, because it mostly consists of small municipalities that have been engulfed by growing metropolitan areas. Four of the five Spanish entries are like that, three in Valencia and one in Barcelona; and most other entries in the top 20 are suburbs of Paris, Athens or Naples.

> A city proper is the geographical area contained within city limitsI'm not sure about the others, but the one from Barcelona is a city actually, with their own local government and all, separate from Barcelona, exactly like Badalona on the other end of Barcelona. It is within the city-limits of Barcelona (region, not city) though.

A lot of other European governments took on too much public debt and had to enforce austerity measures. This proved very unpopular.Unlike the US, the Spanish government did not bail out private industry debt. And so 15 years later here we are. Not enough housing stock and not enough private builders to carryon building more.

And meanwhile, getting any kind of building permits is super hard so there's only a trickle of new property being built that lags behind demand.There's a real estate bubble where real estate value outgrows inflation structurally. So housing is getting more and more expensive. To the point where a normal person with a normal income has basically no chance at all at finding anything decent on the market.The solution of building more housing and making it easier for property owners to rent out their property are consistently not happening. The Netherlands actually has large amounts of empty property where the owners prefer to not rent it out and keep their investment liquid because it's such a PITA to get out of an agreement. There's also a history of privatized housing corporations selling off their property to make some quick money for the share holders. The net result is a huge mess of private property that is either not rented out or rented out at extortion prices. At the same time there's also growing amount of empty commercial real estate. Because people work from home now. Converting that for housing is another regulation challenge.The problem isn't greed but broken policy. The reflex of ""protecting"" renters has had the opposite negative effects on the rental market. Things like Airbnb are more like a symptom than the cause of this.The way I see it, house construction should not be expensive. It's artificial scarcity. A 50K camper can be pretty comfortable. But forget about having the right to use that as a place to live. You are instead expected to pay extortion rents or buy your own 500K piece of shit tiny apartment that is actually smaller and less comfortable than the bloody camper. A camper is just a house with wheels. Those are mass produced in factories. Houses without wheels should be much simpler to make. This never was a technical problem. Prefab housing is kind of a solved problem. It's not that hard. Any idiot can construct a garden shed in an afternoon. If the rules were different, most big cities would have huge slums with campers and other improvised housing. Regulation is what keeps this under control. But when policy breaks down, slums like that become the next logical level of this crisis.A good example of exemptions in the Netherlands are so-called holiday homes where people live permanently; despite this clearly being illegal. Evicting people would create an unsolvable problem for bureaucrats. So, a lot of people that live like that got their situation legalized. And of course recreational units tend to be in nice places too. So, it's a popular thing. If tens of thousands of people start parking their campers on the edge of town bureaucrats would struggle to address the issue without creating a bigger crisis.Probably something like this will force a solution eventually.

This is the wrong way to frame this issue. A lot of cities like Paris and Amsterdam have this issue with short-term renting. ""Build moar"" is just not really an option for these type of city.Firstly, the constructible area of the city is limited. So build, but build where ? You can expand horizontally, but this creates challenges with public transportation and other public services. And it can be slow since it means having to expel industry and agriculture further to rezone area into constructible home/office area.
So the other option is to build up, which means destroying potentially historic building, changing the skyline and viewpoint. This would be bad for tourism (and people who live here might not like it either), since this is a big reason why people even come to visit.In the past, cities had simple way to deal with this. With zoning and hotel licences, the city could have a real urban plan on how it wanted to evolve and how much space it wanted to dedicate to tourism vs industry vs offices vs homes.
But AirBnb came and just said ""fuck that"" and bypass complitely the licence système and or building and operating permit usually needed for tourism. Greed and capitalism took advantage of that and the number of place to rent or buy descreased significantly in favour of short term tourism rental, making living in the city slowly unaffordable.Building more is not that simple. AirBnb respecting the law is a simple solution. It won't complitely solve the issue of the availaibility of affordable home, but it sures as hell help.

Get over it!  Seriously, most buildings are not historic. By trying to make them all historic you ensure they are all lost and the few that really are historic can't stand out for the history they represent.  Save what is really history, but not everything.Similarly, the skyline will change.  That is life.  Accept it. You do not own the view, it is the combination of everyone, and not everyone agrees with you so why are you forcing your preferred view on others?

It's a lot more selfish and malicious than that. They want to remain housed affordably, so they support rent control, but they don't care about the city being affordable in general or for anyone not already living there. Often they outright oppose it (because those moving in would be ethnic minorities or poorer, with concerns about crime), but they disguise their racism with ridiculous aesthetic preferences about ""skylines"" and ""shadows"" and ""neighborhood character"", block highrises, block most construction, and you end up with rent controls for current residents but years long wait lists. Working 100% as designed.What locals in attractive locations really want is to restrict supply, because the majority are homeowners and want to preserve their paper net worth. They caused the problem, benefit from it and don't want it fixed.

I know it's always been a bit of a financial asset, but the past 40 years have really seen this accelerate to pretty crazy levels. The issue, when you boil it down to the basics is: wealthy folks, development companies, overseas oligarchs, hedge funds, etc. owning many properties where they try to extract as much value as possible. This means that rents go up and short-term-rentals become more viable. This also means that young middle-class families can't afford to purchase or to live there, so it pushes out locals (this is especially bad in Lisbon).The solution seems to be government telling you what you can or you can't do with your private property, which does not sit well with me, but it's becoming more and more clear that this can't go on forever.

I like what Singapore is doing - having a government built “base level” of housing that is both abundant and readily available - it can anchor the price where deep excesses are harder to end up with.It's like a market where a very significant player keeps the price law, because of its own reasons.In such a scenario the price will not go up as sharply, so there would be less incentive for people to buy real estate just as a financial vehicle.And the government can also prioritise who it sells the units it builds to - e.g. not investors.I honestly am surprised why western governments are not trying this.

Expats come, locals are pushed out, existing business is replaced by business catering towards expats. But an economy built on being a trendy expat location is not sustainable. Expats will leave to a new place eventually, and then the city is dead. This dynamic is accelerated by the fact that locals are forced out when expacts come, but the city was attractive in the first place because of how charming locals made it.If you run the city - and imagine it's a company, and you're the CEO - you can see that your city is falling for a hype train that will eventually kill it. The smart thing is to not let that hype train happen.Because expat purchase power is a mutliple of your locals, you need to find other levers. Every company would do the same thing.

Living quarters vs short-time rentals drastically change requirements for and load on surrounding infrastructure, which is built out based on established zoning.

Between zoning, easements, nuisance laws, government has a lot of say in how you use your private property. Owners even stepped it up a notch and invited HOAs, a quasi-government that has even more say about your property.Unfortunately, people love telling their neighbors how they should live.

That solves some of the problem with people thinking it's okay to fire off a huge AI slop PR and make it the reviewer's responsibility to see how much the LLM hallucinated.  No, you have to look at yourself first, because it's YOUR code no matter what tool you used to help write it.

This might be unpopular, but that is seeming more like an opportunity if we want to continue allowing AI to generate code.One of the annoying things engineers have to deal with is stopping whatever they're doing and doing a review. Obviously this gets worse if more total code is being produced.We could eliminate that interruption by having someone doing more thorough code reviews, full-time. Someone who is not being bound by sprint deadlines and tempted to gloss over reviews to get back to their own work. Someone who has time to pull down the branch and actually run the code and lightly test things from an engineer's perspective so QA doesn't hit super obvious issues. They can also be the gatekeeper for code quality and PR quality.

In practice, you should have at least one independent reviewer who did not actively worked on the PR.That reviewer should also download the entire code, run it, make tests fail and so on.In my experience, it's also good that this is not a fixed role ""the reviewer"", and a responsability everyone in the team shares (your next task should always be: review someone else's work, only pick a new thing to do if there is nothing to review).This practice increases quality dramatically.

When really end of the day it's matrix math against memory and sync of that state to the display.From a hardware engineers perspective, the mess of devs and non-devs is the same abstract mess of electrical states that have nothing to do with the goal.

Trying to create a secure, reliable and scalable system that enables many people to work on one code base, share their code around with others and at the end of the day coordinate this dance of electrons across multiple computers, that's where all of these 'useless' layers of abstraction become absolutely necessary.

I know exactly what those layers of abstraction are used for. Why so many? Jobs making layers of abstraction.But all of them are dev friendly means of modeling memory states for the CPU to watch and transform just so. They can all be compressed into a generic and generalized set of mathematical functions ridding ourselves of the various parser rules to manage each bespoke syntax inherent to each DSL, layers of framework.

Boilerplate comes when your language doesn't have affordances, you get around this with /abstraction/ which leads to DSLs (Domain Specific Languages).Matrix math is generally done on more than raw bits provided by digital circuits.  Simple things like numbers require some amount of abstraction and indirection (pointers to memory addresses that begin arrays).My point is yes, we've gotten ourselves in a complicated tar pit, but it's not because there wasn't a simpler solution lower in the stack.

Why should anyone care about the quality of software that they don't use?
If you wouldn't work on it unless you were paid to, and you can leave if and when it becomes a problem, then why spend mental energy writing even a single line?

LLMs can generate code that works. That much is true. You can generate sufficiently complex projects that simply run on the first (or second try). You can even get the LLM to write tests for the code. You can prompt it for 100% test coverage and it will provide you exactly what you want.But that doesn't mean OP isn't correct. First, you shouldnt be remembering everything. If you are finding yourself remembering everything your project is either small (I'd guess less than 1000 lines) or you are overburdened and need help. Reasoning, logically, through code you write can be done JIT as you're writing the code. LLMs even suffer from the same problem. Instead of calling it ""having to remember to much"" we refer to it as a quantity called ""context window"". The only problem is the LLM won't prompt you telling you that it's context window is so full it can't do it's job properly. A human will.I think an engineer should always be reasoning about their code. They should be especially suspicious of LLM generated code. Maybe I'm alone but if I use an LLM to generate code I will review it and typically end up modifying it. I find even prompting with something like ""the code you write should be maintainable by other engineers"" doesn't produce good value.

I recently reviewed a PR that I suspect is AI generated. It added a function that doesn't appear to be called from anywhere.It's shit because AI is absolutely not on the level of a good developer yet. So it changes the expectation. If a PR is not AI generated then there is a reasonable expectation that a vaguely competent human has actually thought about it. If it's AI generated then the expectation is that they didn't really think about it at all and are just hoping the AI got it right (which it very often doesn't). It's rude because you're essentially pawning off work that the author should have done to the reviewer.Obviously not everyone dumps raw AI generated code straight into a PR, so I don't have any problem with using AI in general. But if I can tell that your code is AI generated (as you easily can in the cases you linked), then you've definitely done it wrong.

This is not a truism. ""My"" code might come from an LLM and that's fine if I can be reasonably confident it works. I might try to gain that confidence by testing the code and reading it to understand what it's doing. It is also true of blog post code, regardless of how I refer to the code; if I link to the blog post, it's because it does a better job of explaining than I ever could in code comments. Whether LLMs make one more productive is hard to measure but it seems to be missing the point to write this.The point is, including the code is a choice and one should be mindful of it, no matter the code's origin. At that point, this comes off like you just have something to prove; there doesn't seem to be a reason not to use the LLM code if you know it works and you know why it works.

Therefore you must verify it works as intended in the real world. This means not shipping code and hoping for the best, but checking that it actually does the right thing in production. And on top of that, you have to verify that it hasn't caused a regression in something else in production.You could try to do that with tests, but tests aren't always feasible. Therefore it's important to design fail-safes into your code that ALERT YOU to unexpected or erroneous conditions. It needs to do more than just log an error to some logging system you never check - you must actually be notified of it, and you should consider it a flaw in your work, like a defective pair of Nikes on an assembly line. Some kind of plumbing must exist to take these error logs (or metrics, traces, whatever) and send it to you. Otherwise you end up producing a defective product, but never know it, because there's nothing in place to tell you its flaws.Every single day I run into somebody's broken webapp or mobile app. Not only do the authors have no idea (either because they aren't notified of the errors, or don't care about them), there is no way for me to even e-mail the devs to tell them. I try to go through customer support, a chat agent, anything, and even they don't have a way to send in bug reports. They've insulated themselves from the knowledge of their own failures.

Nobody sane expects reviewers to babysit untested mega-PRs - that's not their job.

I vibe code a lot of stuff for myself, mostly for viewing data, when I don't really need to care how it works.

Everyone knows how to do that, if it's what they wanted they wouldn't be hiring someone to do it.

I guess to me, it's either the case that LLMs are just another tool, in which case the already existing teachings of best practice should cover them (and therefore the tone and some content of this article is unnecessary) or they're something totally new, in which case maybe some of the already existing teachings apply, but maybe not because it's so different that the old incentives can't reasonably take hold. Maybe we should focus a little bit more attention on that.The article mentions rudeness, shifting burdens, wasting people's time, dereliction. Really loaded stuff and not a framing that I find necessary. The average person is just trying to get by, not topple a social contract. For that, look upwards.

A colleague was working on an important subsystem and would ask Djikstra for a review when he thought it was ready. Djikstra would have to stop what he was doing, analyze the code, and would find a grievous error or edge case. He would point it out to the colleague who would then get back to work. The colleague would submit his code for review again and this could carry on enough times that Djikstra got annoyed.Djikstra proposed a solution. His colleague would have to submit with his code some form of proof or argument as to why it was correct and ready to merge. That way Djikstra could save time by only having to review the argument and not all of the code.There's a way of looking at LLM output as Djikstra's colleague. It puts a lot of burden on the human using this tool to review all of the code. I like Doctorow's mental model of a reverse centaur. The LLM cannot reason and so won't provide you with a sound argument. It can probably tell you what it did and summarize the code changes it made… but it can't decide to merge those changes. It needs a human, the bottom half of the centaur, to do the last bit of work here. Because that's all we're doing when we let these tools do most of the work for us: we're here to take the blame.And all it takes is an implementation of what we're trying to build already, every open source library ever, all of SO, a GW of power from a methane power plant, an Olympic pool of water and all of your time reviewing the code it generates.At the end of the day it's on you to prove why your changes and contributions should be merged. That's a lot of work! But there's no shortcuts. Luckily you can reason while the LLMs struggle with that so use it while you can when choosing to use such tools.

There's a lot of pedantry here trying to argue that there exists some feature which doesn't need to be ""manually"" tested, and I think the definition of ""manual"" can be pushed around a lot. Is running a program that prints ""OK"" a manual test or not? Is running the program and seeing that it now outputs ""grue"" rather than ""bleen"" manual? Does verifying the arithmetic against an Excel spreadsheet count?There are programs that almost can't be manual, and programs that almost have to be manual. I remember when working on PIN pad integration we looked into getting a robot to push the buttons on the pad - for security reasons there's no way of injecting input automatically.What really matters is getting as close to a realistic end user scenario as possible.

Of course that is not a panacea. What can happen in the real world is not truly understanding what the software needs to do. That can result in the contract not being aligned with what the software actually needs. It is quite reasonable to call the outcome of that ""bugs"", but tests cannot catch that either. In that case, the tests are where the problem lies!Most aspects of software are pretty clear cut, though. You can reasonably define a full contract without needing to see it. UX is a particular area where I've struggled to find a way to determine what the software needs before seeing it. There is seemingly no objective measure that can be applied in determining if a UX is going to spark joy in order to encode that in a contract ahead of time. Although, as before, I'm quite interested to learn about how others are solving that problem as leaving it up to ""I'll know it when I see it"" is a pretty horrible approach.

My approach to coding agents is to prepare a spec at the start, as complete as possible, and develop a beefy battery of tests as we make progress. Yesterday there was a story ""I ported JustHTML from Python to JavaScript with Codex CLI and GPT-5.2 in hours"". They had 9000+ tests. That was the secret juice.So the future of AI coding as I see it ... it will be better than pre-2020, we will learn to spec and plan good tests, and the tests are actually our contract the code does what is supposed to do. You can throw away the code and keep the specs and tests and regenerate any time.

For UIs I do a different trick - live diagnostic tests - I ask the agent to write tests that run in the app itself, check consistencies, constraints and expected behaviors. Having the app running in its natural state makes it easier to test, you can have complex constraints encoded in your diagnostics.

I would go a step further: we need to deliver code that belongs. This means following existing patterns and conventions in the codebase. Without explicit instruction, LLMs are really bad at this, and it's one of the things that make it incredibly obvious to reviews that a given piece of code has been generated by AI.

reply

I also see AI coding tools violate ""Chesterton's Fence"" (and the pre-Chesterton's Fence, not sure what that is called, the idea being that code is necessary otherwise it shouldn't be in the source).

reply

They used to be. They have become quite good at it, even without instruction. Impressively so.But it does require that the humans who laid the foundation also followed consistent patterns and conventions. If there is deviation to be found, the LLM will see it and be forced to choose which direction to go, and that's when things quickly fall off the rails. LLMs are not (yet) good at that, and maybe never can be as not even the humans were able to get it right.Garbage in, garbage out, as they say.

That is part of it, yes, but there are many others, such as ensuring that the new code is easy to understand and maintain by humans, makes the right tradeoffs, is reasonably efficient and secure, doesn't introduce a lot of technical debt, and so on.These are things that LLMs often don't get right, and junior engineers need guidance with and mentoring from more experienced engineers to properly learn. Otherwise software that ""works"" today, will be much more difficult to make ""work"" tomorrow.

Your job is to solve customer problems. Their problems may only be solvable with code that is proven to work, but it is equally likely (I dare say even more likely) that their problem isn't best solved with code at all, or even solved with code that doesn't work properly but works well enough.

From the post and the example he links, the point is that if you don't at least look at the running code, you don't know that it works.In my opinion the point is actually well illustrated by Chris's talk here:https://v5.chriskrycho.com/elsewhere/seeing-like-a-programme...(summary of the relevant section if you're not going to click)>>>In the talk ""Seeing Like a Programmer,"" Chris Krycho quotes the conductor and composer Eímear Noone, who said:> ""The score is potential energy. It's the potential for music to happen, but it's not the music.""He uses this quote to illustrate the distinction between ""software as artifact"" (the code/score) and ""software as system"" (the running application/music). His point is that the code itself is just a static artifact—""potential energy""—and the actual ""software"" only really exists when that code is executed and running in the real world.

Your tests run the code. You know it works. I know the article is trying to say that testing is not comprehensive enough, but my experience disagrees. But I also recognize that testing is not well understood (quite likely the least understood aspect of computer science!) — and if you don't have a good understanding you can get caught not testing the right things or not testing what you think you are. I would argue that you would be better off using your time to learn how to write great tests instead of using it to manually test your code, but to each their own.What is more likely to happen is not understanding the customer needs well enough, leaving it impossible to write tests that align with what the software needs to do. Software development can break down very quickly here. However, manual testing does not help. You can't know what to manually test without understanding the problem either. However, as before, your job is not to deliver proven code. Your job is to solve customer problems. When you realize that, it becomes much less likely that you write tests that are not in line with the solution you need.

We already delegate accountability to non-humans all the time:
- CI systems block merges
- monitoring systems page people
- test suites gate different thingsIn practice accountability is enforced by systems, not humans.. humans are defintiely ""blamed"" after the fact, but the day-to-day control loop is automated.As agents get better at running code, inspecting ui state, correlating logs, screenshots, etc they're starting to operationally be ""accountable"" and preventing bad changes from shipping and producing evidence when something goes wrong .At some point humans role shifts from ""i personally verify this works"" to ""i trust this verification system and am accountable for configuring it correctly"".Thats still responsibility, but kind of different from whats described here. Taken to a logical extreme, the arguement here would suggest that CI shouldn't replace manual release checklists

Human collaboration works on trust.Part of trust is accountability and consequences. If I get caught embezzling money from my employer I can lose my job, harm my professional reputation and even go to jail. There are stakes!I computer system has no stakes, and cannot take accountability for its actions. This drastically limits what it makes sense to outsource to that system.A lot of this comes down to my work on prompt injection. LLMs are fundamentally gullible: an email assistant might respond to an email asking for the latest sales figures by replying with the latest (confidential) sales figures.If my human assistant does that I can reprimand or fire them. What am I meant to do with an LLM agent?

Accountability is about what happens if and when something goes wrong. The moon landings were controlled with computer assistance, but Nixon preparing a speech for what happened in the event of lethal failure is accountability. Note that accountability does not of itself imply any particular form or detail of control, just that a social structure of accountability links outcome to responsible person.

Perhaps an unstated and important takeaway here is that junior developers should not be permitted to use an LLMs for the same reason they should not hire people: they have not demonstrated enough skill mastery and judgement to be trusted with the decision to outsource their labor. Delegating to a vendor is a decision made by high-level stakeholders, with the ability to monitor the vendor performance, and replace the vendor with alternatives if that performance is unsatisfactory. Allowing junior developers to use LLM is allowing them to delegate responsibility without any visibility or ability to set boundaries on what can be delegated. Also important: you cannot delegate personal growth, and by permitting junior engineers to use an LLM that is what you are trying to do.

I'm currently working on a side project in Rails using Stimulus but sometimes I wonder if Stimulus is overkill with all of the controllers and stuff as well. Do you have an opinion on when you should reach for something like Inertia or Stimulus over htmx?

I'm not yet sure whether this is a good thing or not -- I'll let you know once my latest iteration of my web framework is finally working as I envisioned, he-said sort-of-jokingly, which should be Soon Now.But yeah, either alternative still beats React by a country mile, since everything related to that descends into madness right away.

Like, even just now, Claude Code with Opus 4-dot-latest, is absolutely convinced you need a bunch of fragile cascading Javascript listeners to dismiss a lower-level menu in case a dialog is opened, while the Unpoly docs, correctly and clearly, point out that 'shatter' exists for just that purpose.And this is one of the use cases that I continue to highlight as the achilles heel of LLMs. I'm not holding it wrong: they're not reading it right.

Of course it will work. I can vibe code the most terrible web framework you have seen within 20 minutes and claim it is better than React, but what does it prove?> You write zero JavaScript
> The whole library is ~14kb gzippedOh sure, if there is nothing else in your UI, and if your Python/Go/whatever backend server has 0 dependency, which almost never happens.

I appreciate the basic demos, but I think what would really sell me is showing the extensibility story. Show me what it looks like when I need it to do something a bit beyond what it has in the box. Where do I add the JavaScript for that? Is it raw, inline, or are we back to packages and bundling and a build step? Am I building application JS, or some kind of extension or plugin to htmx itself? How chained am I going to be to its specific paradigms and opinions?The page says htmx isn't for writing a true SPA like Google Docs, but where's the line? Show me an app that has pushed up against the limits of this system, and what happens in that scenario.

I'm not sure ""fear"" is exactly the right word here, but it's something I consciously evaluate for when looking at any new framework or library. Anything that has a lot of ""magic"" or ""by-convention"" type config is subject to this.You start with the ""hello world"" example, and then you hit that wall. The test of an awesome framework vs a fundamentally limited (or even broken) one is: can you build on what you have with extensions, or do you have to rewrite everything you did? There's a lot of these where as soon as you want to do something slightly custom, you can't use _any_ of the magic and have to redo everything in a different way.This isn't just libraries either. Another almost worse example is AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Simple way to get an app up and going, and it handles a lot of the boilerplate stuff for you. The problem is as soon as you want to extend it slightly, like have another custom load balancer route, you actually have to completely abandon the entire thing and do _everything_ yourself.This is a really hard thing to get right, but in my view is one of the things that contributes to a framework's longevity. If you hit that wall and can't get past it, the next project you do will be in something else. Once enough people start posting about their experiences hitting the wall, other people won't even pick it up and the framework dwindles to a niche audience or dies completely.

I think this scenario would either be very apparent early on in the project, or wouldn't actually be that challenging.  There are a couple ways you could run into the limits of HTMX:1. You require purely client side interactivity.  The right (IMO) way to use HTMX is as a replacement for sending JSON over the wire and rendering it into HTML on the client, so if your app has features that _wouldn't_ be done that way, you should reach for something else.  Fortunately there's lots of solutions  to this problem.  You can use built in browser features to achieve a lot of the basics now (e.g. the <details> tag means you don't really need custom scripts if you just want an accordion), write simple vanila scripts, or adopt light weight libraries like alpinejs or the creator of HTMX's (only slightly deranged) hyperscript.2. Maybe your purely client side interactivity needs are complex enough that you do need a SPA framework. At that point you can adopt the islands architecture and create interactive components in your fraemwork of choice, but continue to use hypermedia to communicate with the backend.3. If you can't easily separate client side state (handled with javascript, potentially with the aid of frameworks) from server state (handled on the server and sent to the client via hypermedia), you can again adopt the islands architecture and have your islands manage their own network requests to the backend.4. If the above applies to all of your app, then hypermedia/HTMX is a bad fit.  But this should generally be pretty obvious early on, because it's about the basic, fundamental nature of the app.  You probably know you're building google docs when you start build google docs, not mid-way through.

- No JSON serialization: HTMX sends form data natively no JSON.stringify() needed
- Less JavaScript: Declarative hx-* attributes replace imperative fetch code. in my world declarative always wins.
- Automatic headers: HTMX handles X-User-Id and other headers configured globally
- Built-in error handling: hx-on::error instead of .catch() chains
- Swapping flexibility: Can show success/error feedback via hx-swap without custom JS
- Request indicators: Free loading states with hx-indicator
- Debugging: HTMX events visible in browser devtools; fetch requires console.logand most all: performance. multicardz goes like stink. 100/100 lighthouse scores, First Contentful Paint 0.4 s, Largest Contentful Paint 0.5 s, Total Blocking Time 0 ms, Cumulative Layout Shift 0, Speed Index, 0.5 sstill prerelease, but cautiously hope to go general availability by and of year.

My startup did.And now we're going to rip it all out and move to a React front-end.HTMX makes response handling much more complex. Every endpoint returns 3–5 different HTML fragments. Frontend and backend must agree on every scenario — success, validation errors, system errors, partial updates, full reloads.And HTMX is still a fairly obscure library. The documentation and examples are lacking, there isn't a real set of established best practices at scale, and not for nothing, LLMs aren't great at it.React is mature, used at scale, provides separation of concerns, and is great for agentic AI coding. HTMX has its place for simple projects, but for anything non-trivial, it's a no for me.

Here is what my htmx apps have: 
- Single-purpose endpoints: Each endpoint returns ONE thing (a card list, a tag cloud, a form fragment)
- Optimistic UI: Preferences like font/theme update the DOM immediately; the save is fire-and-forget with no response needed
- Simple error handling: Most endpoints either succeed (return HTML) or fail (HTTP error code)
- No fragment orchestration: Not returning 3-5 fragments; using hx-swap-oob sparinglyHere is how I update fonts on screen in user prefs:
User selects font → JS updates body class immediately → htmx.ajax() saves in background → donevs. the anti-pattern you're describing:User submits form → backend validates → returns success fragment OR error fragment OR partial update OR redirect signal → frontend must handle all casesNo language or programming paradigm is perfect. All programming is an exercise in tradeoffs. The mark of a good CTO or architect is that ability to draw out the best of the technology selection and minimize the tradeoffs.

Well, frontend and backend always need to agree on every scenario, that's why I prefer to do validation on backedn and frontend to just display it and not do any validation.

You're argument is fine assuming you wish to become another react frontend in a sea of react frontends.But the documentation example is a terrible argument, the benefit of HTMX is it is easy to understand what is actually happening. There is no magic, you don't need to dive through millions of lines of code to figure out what this is doing like react. It's very basic javascript. Just read the library, frankly you don't even need any documentation. Just take 15 mins and read the entire library.

Thus, it's considered normal that the backend team spits out some JSON and doesn't know or care what the frontend team does with it.With HTMX that distinction doesn't exist so much (the frontend consists of fragments generated by the backend) so you will need a different organizational approach. The “frontend” folks will need to write a lot of “backend” code, but presumably in a separable layer.

The JS framework is the frontend, so you're still coordinating.> If its returning HTML that's intended to go in a particular place on a page, the front-end has far less flexibility and pretty much has to put it in a specific place.Well yes, because presumably that's what the app is supposed to do. If it's not supposed to put it in that place, why would that be the specified target?If this kind of static assignment of targets is not flexible enough for some reason, then use OOB updates which lets you replace fragments by id attribute. That lets you decouple some of these kinds of decisions.Although ""endpoints can return 3-5 different versions of HTML"" is also a bit of a red flag that you're not using htmx correctly, generally endpoints should be returning 1, maybe 2 fragments in unusual cases.In any case, you might find DataStar more to your liking, it's partway between React and htmx.

Most of the frontend stuff I do is for internal pages on embedded devices, and I'm very happy with a structure where I have the frontend being a full React fancy component lib SPA that is eventually just compiled down to a zip bundle of files that the backend needs to know nothing about and can serve as dumb files. The backend is a JSON API of sorts that I would need to build anyway for other use cases.

The only exposure the back-end has to HTML is streaming the static files to the browser. Which can be done in small chunks.If your back-end is rendering HTML with every request, it has to do a lot more work. It has to load HTML templates into memory and insert strings into them.

Yet I know roughly what it is, but I couldn't begin to actually write the stuff myself.Good abstractions mean you don't have to worry about the layer below.Now of course it's not really the case that React holds up to being a good abstraction, especially when it comes to CSS and styling, but I don't think it's a forgone conclusion that abstractions force you to learn the level below.Otherwise we'd all spend half our time learning assembly.I do have sympathy though for a developer who just wants to focus on the higher level paradigm and let the library maintainers worry about the innards.

For a good part of your career this is true, but eventually you will need to justify your senior salary by being able to debug react via looking at library code itself, or understanding the event bubbling under the hood, or figure out why the output css isn't working.Saw a video, wish I could remember who, someone developing a game in c-something. There was some bug they couldn't figure out so they jumped into I guess the assembly for that block of higher abstracted code, and was able to find some kind of memory issue.

That's not a valid analogy, 99.99% of C# developers never see or touch CLR bytecode, where every React developer is still working with HTML+CSS.

reply

In theory, react developers ought to be able to code against the react API in typescript, without seeing the ""raw"" HTML+JS that gets delivered to the browser.So what's failing those developers? Is it the tooling, the abstraction itself, or something else?

However, I've recently made the difficult decision to rewrite the frontend in React (specifically React/TS, TanStack Query, Orval, and Shadcn). In a perfect world, I'd rewrite the python backend in go, but I have to table that idea for now.The reason? The ""LLM tax."" While HTMX is a joy for manual development, my experience the last year is that LLMs struggle with the ""glue"" required for complex UI items in HTMX/Alpine. Conversely, the training data for React is so massive and the patterns so standardized that the AI productivity gains are impossible to ignore.Recently, I used Go/React for a microservice that actually has turned into similarly complex scale as the python/htxm app I focused on most of the year, and it was so much more productive than python/htmx. In a month of work I got done what took me about 4-5 months in python/htmx. I assume because the typing with go and also LLM could generate perfectly typed hooks from my OpenAPI spec via Orval and build out Shadcn components without hallucinating.I still love the HTMX philosophy for its simplicity, but in 2024/2025, I've found that I'm more productive choosing the stack that the AI ""understands"" best. For new projects, Go/React will now my default. If I have to write something myself again (God, I hope not) I may use htmx.

In my experience, a lot of SPAs transfer more data than the front-end actually needs. One team I worked on was sending 4MB over the wire to render 14kb of actual HTML. (No, there wasn't some processing happening on the front-end that needed the extra data.) And that was using graphql, some dev just plunked all the fields in the graphql query instead of the ones actually needed. I've seen that pattern a lot, although in some cases it's been to my benefit, like finding more details on a tracking website than the UI presented.

The issue with htmx is that it is fairly prescriptive of how one should go about building dynamic interactions, and it becomes complex quickly if the dynamic interaction is more than trivial. I don't disagree with its philosophy at all (as I say, I use it for my own site) but it becomes an issue when my product owner tells me that I need to do some funny dynamic thing because it will make the business or clients happy (for some reason), and then it becomes a mission to wrangle it with htmx attributes. And I have to follow that, because as much as it pains me to say it, making stuff pretty and dynamic on the UI is an easy way to score points. It is one of those areas of enterprise software development which seems like a huge upgrade to non-technical people whilst not requiring too much effort.The one thing raw JavaScript is quite well suited for is hacking together some DOM manipulation. I dislike JavaScript in every other domain except this - its in this arena where its leniency is very useful.

Well you didn't write standard HTML attributes, you wrote custom attributes that are picked up by a JS framework, so potentially the worst of both worlds depending on your problem space.Having tried HTMX a few times, the problem is firmly in creating a backend that feeds it properly.

First - simple use cases sure great. But imagine you have to update some element out of the from tree.

Let's not go complicated just think of variants in an E-commerce admin panel.3 variants with 5 values each these are 125 SKU rows that must be collapsed group wise.htmx can do it but it's going to be very very difficult and brittle.So it is surely very useful but it is NOT the only tool for all use cases.

You can do this with plain old Javascript. Make a request, swap out the [inner | outer]HTML with the result. If you want a nice visual transition, wrap the swap in a startViewTransition(). Obviously, you need to be extra careful if you're using user-submitted HTML. Otherwise, it's fairly straight forward.

You can have the bots churn through all that boiler plate, it won't be any worse than what human react devs write, and keep the bots away from your mission critical code because it isn't all munged together like in a SSR app.

I personally prefer UIs with great encapsulation/composition, which used to be Vue, but with AI starting to write more of my UIs now I've switched to React/Next.js for new non-progressive UIs.

I'm however more curious about going the other way, i.e. you start a project with Htmx which happily grows but after a while, a large feature is requested which inevitably changes the direction of the app into React use-case territory. I can't think of concrete example but you now have to work around it with htmx or commit to rewriting to React (or alternative). Wonder what are thoughts of people who had to deal with this

Yes It has a ""learning curve"" but so does everything (even React).Also Angular is now about twenty thousand times simpler than it was in the past as you can use Signals for reactivity, and basically ignore Observables for 95% of things.Angular also removes the a lot of the negatives outlined in the page - no npm, no node_modules, no ecosystem fatigue, no debates on state management etc etc. Everything you need is included in one dependency you can load from a CDN.I never liked that in react you are mangling the presentation and business logic in one tsx file (separation of concerns? React ignores that lesson for some reason). Htmx feels even worse in this way because now you also have html snippets and templates in your backend code too! Nightmare!  Angular let's you leave the templates as standalone files and not mushed into your typescript like react (although you can inline them into the typescript if you want to, but obviously no one does that for anything apart from the most trivial of components)

htmx is a great idea, but it's not necessary anymore. We're very close to invokers being baseline (and even that is just an extension of the ""composedPath includes -> invoke"" pattern), and that will take care of plenty of what htmx was designed to do. Between features like that, and web components, I'm very happy to stick with ""plain HTML"" (no frameworks; my web components do not draw from a core module or anything).Also, just a suggestion because it's not technically wrong:The example of sometimes needing an auto-completing search box is probably not the best one to use. I'm sure it's meant to say ""you want the results to be queried from a server/database on every input"", which you would certainly need javascript for. But the specific example of just having a search box autocomplete can actually be fulfilled with a datalist element. It won't dynamically re-query results, but it will filter based on input. So it's a muddy example, at best, and that's probably not great for the point trying to be made.

From what I've seen, invokers without extra code are designed for client side interactivity (e.g. showing a modal), which is orthogonal to the (correct, IMO) use case of HTMX.  You shouldn't use HTMX to turn every custom user interaction into a network round trip, you should use it instead of fetching JSON.  If a user interaction wouldn't trigger a network request if you built your app with react/vue/svelte/{insert_framework_of_choice}, then it shouldn't trigger one if you build it with HTMX either.You can add custom commands with invokes and custom JS, but at that point you're basically re-implementing HTMX yourself, and I'm not sure what the advantage of that would be over hx-trigger=""command"" (especially when you also consider using fixi if you don't need all the features of HTMX).  There's also the triptych proposals [2] from one of the HTMX maintainers which would add some of HTMX's behaviors to HTML, but those are a long way from being baseline, and may get there.[1] https://github.com/bigskysoftware/fixi[2] https://alexanderpetros.com/triptych/

Exactly. So why use a library? If it's that simple, the suggestion is akin to using a library for a toggle, when a checkbox would do. Yes, there are reasons to do it, but no, it's not what I'm going to do most of the time.ETA: sorry; I should have mentioned, I'm ignoring server stuff because it's not my use case. I don't hydrate code on a server and send it down to people. I just write HTML or let javascript compose it in the browser. Since I don't use frameworks, that's the way I've developed to be efficient. Since I can't speak to how useful htmx is for server-rendered stuff, I'm staying out of it. Just talking about what htmx can do for me, which is very little.

Well why not have the benefits of invokers, but today - with HTMX?HTMX could eventually switch its implementation to use invokers under the hood in the future, and you'd have the convenience of using declarative behaviors on your buttons, today.> autocomplete can actually be fulfilled with a datalist elementI wish that the spec would cover more use cases, but last time I tried to use it, I couldn't, because it has really bad UX, and is inconsistent across browsers.Also, like you mentioned, it only works for small data sets that you can deliver with the initial HTML, not large amounts of data which reside on the server.You could argue that these are use cases where you wouldn't require an auto-complete in the first place, because the data set is too small.

Yes it is. When the query is more expensive than the entire dataset included in some other query, a static list built from previously queried content is the more performant search, even if you want to classify it as a filter. I, as a user, am still searching through this list of unknown nodes even if you, the program, are just filtering what your nodes are for me. All searches are filters; hard lines for best practices only matter insofar as they engage with their practical application.

Can someone explain something to me?To my view, the single best idea React has is that it forces you to encapsulate the full set of states in your component - not anywhere else. For instance, if you have a ""Comment"" button that becomes ""Submitted"" after you click it, you must include that state inside the comment component. You can't hide it somewhere else (i.e., in the input field after you press cmd-enter). This is a huge thing for managing complexity - if you spread state updates to a number of different places, it becomes significantly harder to reason about how the button works.Replacing the button with whatever the server responds with may sound simple, but it really makes it hard to answer the question of ""what are all the states this button could be in"". I mean, what if the server returns another button... which hits another API... etc?The weird thing is that HTMX talks about Locality of Behavior (yay!), but doesn't seem to practice it at all?BTW, one other thing:> The ecosystem is why your node_modules folder is 2GB. The ecosystem is why there are 14 ways to style a component and they all have tradeoffs. The ecosystem is why ""which state management library"" is somehow still a debate.> HTMX's ecosystem is: your server-side language of choice. That's it. That's the ecosystem.Really?

The premise is that React's ""UI=f(state)"" creates a synchronization problem that doesn't need to exist.If the DOM is the authority on state (not a projection of state held elsewhere), there's nothing to sync. You read state from where it already lives.I built multicardz on this: 1M+ cards, sub-500ms searches, 100/100 Lighthouse scores.If you have time to read, I would very much like to hear your thoughts; genuine technical pushback welcome.

I've only toyed around with htmx, but it really is refreshing. Of course you can't do everything that you can do with a fully-fledged client side framework. But once you try it out, you realize that more of the web is just markup + forms than you realized. I wouldn't build a live chat app with htmx, but I would totally build a reporting dashboard.

But yes, it's ""vibes"" - although extremely obvious IMO. Extreme usage of headings for paragraphs, which are often just a bullet list or a string of short marketing-speak fluff statements.That's all aesthetic though and not the offensive part, it's just what makes it obvious. The offensive part is you can read the whole thing and come away with little more than the title. The author's perspective and voice is lost, beyond ""they want you to try htmx"" I can't tell what they care about or why, I can't tell what it is they were excited to try to convey.Btw they did just add this to the footer.> Does this all sound a bit like shallow slop? Yup, please help make it better.

Also the lack of comments calling out the obvious AI style is confusing to me. HN usually jumps on this stuff. Are we just getting tired of calling it out? Or have we just accepted that we're going to read slop sometimes? Or I guess the opportunity to talk about HTMX was probably more important than the post content

I mean nothing is straight LLM, you must prompt them and people are putting their ideas in and linking to other sources and getting stuff like this out.

This means that in theory you (as a dev) don't need (to write any) js, nor do your users need to download a full page (for any interaction) like it's 1999. Your webserver replies with fully server-renderd HTML but just for the dom node (say a div) that you want to replace.It's fun for very simple things, even great for extremely simple interactions modes. For interactive products, anything beyond simple CRUDs, it's madness.Whenever you want to sprinkle a tiny bit of interactivity you'll have to choose between the path of least resistance (a small hack on HTMX) or a proper way. State management gets out of control real fast, it's the opposite of UI=f(state).I've seen it go bad, then worse with alpine-js, and then completely ripped in favor of something where people can let the browser do browser things.[edit for clarity]

The magic of this is that it's pretty easy to make SPA-like webapps with no javascript or complex client side framework. You can write your server in python, rust, clojure, whatever. If you don't need a lot of state management, it's really simple and awesome.

Valve's hardware products, aside from being awesome and setting a standard that others have to match, are really an insurance policy. They ensure Valve cannot be locked out of their own market by platform owners like Microsoft or Meta using their leverage to either take a cut of their revenue or outright ban Steam in favor of their own stores (as it looked like MS might try to do in the Win8 days). By owning a platform of their own Valve always has a fallback option.

reply

I don't follow the console market at all, but don't its players subsidize their hardware by keeping software (game) costs high? I didn't think they had anything like Steam's level of regular discounted sales. ""Price is king"" can cut both ways.

The prime Nintendo games (i.e. Animal Crossing, Pokemon and anything Mario related) are rarely discounted, yes - and Nintendo can do this because these games have borderline drooling fanbases and the games aren't available anywhere else.But everything else? There's constantly something on sale on the Switch store.

It's also the most convenient by far, and the new Steam Family stuff lets you share all of your games with all of your siblings without any need for password sharing like you'd have to on e.g. GoG or Epic. I have 4 siblings and most of us are married. Our combined Steam library is well over 1000 games

ish.    Sony/Microsoft/Nintendo likely have contracts locking down RAM prices whereas Valve will have to negotiate theirs based on current prices.

Microsoft has been trying to corner Valve. Valve is finding clever ways out by getting developers to finally make their games Linux compatible.If Valve's consoles become broadly successful, that's an added bonus. The real win is to outflank Microsoft.One of Microsoft's biggest mistakes was to give up on Windows Phone. One of Meta's biggest mistakes was to give up on their phone (they gave in early due to technical choices, not just lack of user demand).Owning a ""pane of glass"" lets you tax and control everything. Apple and Google have unprecedented leverage in two of the biggest markets in the world. Microsoft wants that for gaming, and since most gaming is on Windows, they have a shot at it.Valve is doing everything they can to make sure developers start targeting other platforms so PC games remain multi-platform. It's healthy for the entire ecosystem.If we had strong antitrust enforcement (which we haven't had in over 25 years), Apple and Google wouldn't have a stranglehold on mobile, and Microsoft would get real scrutiny for all of their stunts they've pulled with gaming, studio acquisitions, etc.Antitrust enforcement is good for capitalism. It ensures that stupid at-scale hacks don't let the largest players become gluttons and take over the entire ecosystem. It keeps capitalism fiercely competitive and makes all players nimble.The government's antitrust actions against Microsoft in the 1990s-2000s was what paved the way for Apple to become what it is today. If we had more of it, one wonders what other magnificent companies and products we might have.

Valve actually encourages devs to only provide Windows builds compatible with Proton, or at least it used to, to the disappointment of some professional porters. Mainly because several devs kept leaving their Linux builds abandoned while still maintaining their Windows ones.

They had no other choice.The technical foundation of the prior WP versions (aka, Windows CE) was just too dated and they didn't have a Windows kernel / userland capable of performantly dealing on ARM, x86 performance was and still is utter dogshit on battery powered devices, they didn't have a Windows userland actually usable on anything touch based, and most importantly they did not have developer tooling even close to usable.At the same time, Apple had a stranglehold over the upper price class devices, Android ate up the low and mid range class - and unlike the old Ballmer ""DEVELOPERS DEVELOPERS DEVELOPERS"" days, Microsoft didn't have tooling that enticed developers, while Apple had Xcode with emulators that people had been used to for years, and Android had a fully functioning Eclipse based toolchain.

Seems unlikely because we believe Valve has integrity.   But it's possible they have less integrity than we think, and they pursue this strategy to make some of those games with kernel-level anti-cheat available on the Steam Machine.

I find this framing to be beyond maddening.

It was also a thoughtful partnering with hardware vendors, so they weren't shipping hundreds of thousands of units to Walmart shelves was just sat there and lost them tens of millions of dollars, which is also what I think of when something's considered a flop.But it was a thoughtful, intelligent long-term commitment to an ecosystem that bore fruit in large part due to the credible long-term commitment as the library of steamos compatible games grew and set up the Steam Deck for success. And now it looks like the wind is at their back with the new line of hardware, but I think it's best understood as a return on investment that begun those many years ago.I think it reflects a kind of intelligence and long-term thinking that Google is pathologically incapable of, by contrast.

Turns out that the usual Microsoft incompetence-and-ADHD have kind-of eliminated that threat all by itself.Also: turns out that, if you put enough effort into it, Linux is actually a quite-usable gaming platform.Still: are consumers better off today than in the PS2 era? I sort-of doubt it, but, yeah, alternate universes and everything...

If you're using nvidia like 75% of Steam's hardware survey reports, it's a mixed bag and 1% lows are fucking abysmal compared to windows.But try getting nvidia to care about Linux beyond CUDA. They'd rather just stop selling GPUs to normal people before they do that.

It was astoundingly unusable for sharing Microsoft's own game within my own household with my own family members. Completely broken user experience.It's not hard to believe that Steam was able to thrive because Microsoft has just done an amazingly bad job with this. I've been in software dev for 20 years and it still baffles me that companies with tens of thousands of engineers can produce such shitty software experiences.

When I fire up my linux workstation or steam deck and browse my library, there are countless games, marked as ""platinum"" in ProtonDB, but do not work OOTB. Sometimes it's a later Proton version that broke the compatibility, sometimes you still need to tinker in the settings in addition to choose the correct proton version. All in all, I've spent quite some time getting games to run I just wanted to play a single afternoon as nostaliga hitted hard.As long as issues like this are not resolved, I don't believe in Steam Machines as alternatives for consoles in the living room space.And yes, I'm still considering a steam machine for my living room, even though I will need to support my wife and kids in getting games to run on the TV.

Valve could branch into Apple's areas, but they don't seem particularly interested in doing so yet.EDIT: rather, Apple cares a lot about phone gaming, but that's an area that Valve has shown few signs of moving in on.

I'd love someone to actually compete with Apple at the specific kind of thing they do, but I don't see it in the cards for Valve. Too much distance, with things they don't have to solve to hit other (apparent) targets of theirs.As for Microsoft, what is Valve threatening? Home no-business-use-case (mostly gaming and maybe light web browsing) PC owners, and I suppose x-box? The former has got to be negligible at this point, and the latter… I guess maybe, yeah, they could threaten that.[edit] to soften this somewhat, I do love what Valve is doing and their micro-PC thing they're releasing next year is likely going to be an instant purchase for me, provided supply issues don't drive the price insanely high or otherwise mess with the release. I happen to be in the exact niche of people who are thrilled to have a good low-tinkering option that lets me ditch my last Windows machine, so this stuff's my jam.

With the broader job market being not-great, and everyone trying some sort of side hustle with the aims of making it big, it's definitely the bubble I'm in, but the ""home"" case has a lot of Google free office suite business looking usage, and even if there isn't a side hustle, maybe my friends are super weird but they use Google sheets to organize things even for non-business life things when things get complicated. Eg planning a wedding. That's Google and not Valve, but if customers get Steamboxes to access that vs Windows laptops (or Chromebooks), it looks like a threat to Microsoft to me.

From what I see, Microsoft is the only one they have been gunning for, and even that behemoth is looking to get out of the way. Their Xbox platform has practically imploded, and they have specifically designed Windows 11 to be less of a PC operating system and more of an ads platform and a cross-selling channel for their AI/cloud offerings indicating that they've lost interest in the consumer market as a whole.

Their original answer was a resounding ""nothing"" - Steam Machines solved a problem for Valve (fear of an impending ""Windows Store"" being added by Microsoft that would steal the battlefield from Valve), but very little for the customer.I guess that same question needs to be asked again here: are there sufficient problems that the average game-player at home has that are better answered by a Steam Machine than a Windows 11 box? Are those real problems experienced by the broader market of people, or are those just 
tangential issues cared about by a more vocal few?

It fixes a lot of issues for me (I will buy a steam machine upon release):I used to prefer consoles for the living room - put the disk in, and go. But nowadays consoles have the same issues: Giant downloads, patches, tweaking GUI settings and fear of not getting the best performance (PS5 Pro variants, Xbox S/X etc., performance vs. quality mode settings). PC games are now not only more price competetive through the sales, but consoles use now downloads at high prices to undermine the second hand market, or account-lock your game even when purchased as disk.

I used Windows 10 for a long time as a glorified bootloader into Steam (on a dualboot Linux machine), but it become full annoyances and win11 worsens that (""You need a Onedrive account"" - ""oh, did you try Edge yet?"" - ""Your computer is at risk"" - ""We installed copilot for you!"" etc.).

This is not true.   It was true in 2019 when the PS5 was initially announced, but PS5 has been sold at a (slim) profit since 2021.

College students and anyone needing a reliable “everyday” laptop benefits from machines that balance performance, portability, and affordability without skimping on essential features.

The good news is that this HP 15.6″ laptop currently sells for $559 on Amazon, dramatically reduced from its listed $2,399 price, representing an all-time low that you won't find on HP's official website. The combination of 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD storage, Intel's 8-core i3-N305 processor, and a full HD touchscreen creates a capable workhorse that handles schoolwork, entertainment and light creative tasks with ease.

See at Amazon

The Intel i3-N305 processor has eight cores that run at a base speed of 1.8GHz and can go up to 3.8GHz when more power is needed for demanding apps. This many cores is more than what most budget laptops have, and it lets you really multitask by running multiple browser tabs, streaming video, editing documents, and making video calls all at the same time without slowing down. The 6MB L3 cache makes it easier for the processor to get to data that it uses a lot, which makes it respond faster when you switch between apps or load programs you use a lot.

The 16GB of DDR4 RAM gives you plenty of room for modern software needs and makes sure everything runs smoothly even when you have a lot of apps open at once. This much memory can handle everything from simple tasks like browsing the web and editing documents to more difficult ones like editing photos in Lightroom, running several virtual meetings, or working with big spreadsheets.

The storage comes from a 512GB PCIe SSD which is much faster than regular hard drives at booting up, loading applications, and transferring files. The laptop boots up in seconds instead of minutes, apps open almost immediately, and big files move quickly between folders or external drives. This SSD has enough space for the operating system, installed apps, document libraries, photo collections and downloaded content without having to constantly manage files or move them around on external storage.

The 15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen display has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 and an IPS panel that keeps colors and clarity the same from all angles. The micro-edge bezels make the most of the screen space while keeping the laptop's size small. The anti-glare coating cuts down on reflections that make it hard to use outside or in bright indoor spaces. Peak brightness is 300 nits, which is bright enough for most lighting situations, but it won't be as bright as high-end displays in direct sunlight. The touchscreen feature makes it easy to scroll, zoom, and move around Windows 11's touch-friendly interface elements.

Connectivity covers all the bases with a mix of new and old ports that work with a wide range of accessories and peripherals. The two USB Type-A ports work with older devices like mice, keyboards, and external hard drives. The USB Type-C port works with newer accessories and lets you transfer data faster. For presentations or extended desktop setups, the HDMI 1.4b port connects to TVs, projectors, or external monitors. The headphone/microphone jack works with regular headsets for calls and audio. The full-size keyboard has a numeric keypad that is very useful for people who work with spreadsheets or financial data.

The included 8-in-1 USB-C hub adds a lot of new ways to connect: It has an RJ-45 ethernet port for wired networking, two more USB 3.0 ports, SD and Micro SD card slots for moving photos from cameras, another headphone jack, and a 4K HDMI port. This hub turns your laptop into a real workstation that can handle professional tasks that need more than one peripheral and external display at the same time. The hub inclusion is worth a lot because a separate adapter would cost $30 to $50.

For $559 instead of the inflated $2,399 list price, you get a well-equipped laptop that works well every day and is priced competitively with budget Chromebooks while still being able to run all of Windows' features.

Reports are now filtering through all the business chatter about exactly how much dough Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav stands to make from the company's big sale. And, inevitably, it's a jaw-dropping sum no matter who ends up taking control of the media empire.

The term “golden parachute” has rarely been so evocatively applied, and it's how the Hollywood Reporter describes Zaslav's potential payday if the WB sale comes to a successful end. In this case that means raking in as much money as possible for shareholders, “especially if a bidding war escalates and drives Paramount's hostile $30 per share offer even higher, or if Netflix needs to raise its offer.”

THR reported that Zaslav stands to earn “$30 million in ‘golden parachute' compensation, along with $537 million in equity, for a total of $567 million.” His underlings, who will benefit as much as he will if a bidding war breaks out and raises stock prices, are also poised for riches, topped off by Gunnar Wiedenfels, “Zaslav's longtime lieutenant, current CFO, and soon-to-be CEO of spinoff firm Discovery Global,” who's set to get $5 million in cash and $138 million in equity.

This is, mind you, on top of the salaries these people already earn (Zaslav is atop the pyramid with “$51.9 million in pay packages last year”).

The THR story also noted that as part of their takeover bid, David Ellison and Paramount had “promised Zaslav a role as co-CEO and co-chairman worth ‘hundreds of millions of dollars,' with Zaslav alerting the WBD board about the offer, which he said was not appropriate.” Netflix is still the frontrunner in the deal.

No matter what, Zaslav stands to come out like a king—$567 million is equivalent to approximately eight Coyote vs. Acmes or six Batgirls, to name-check a couple of titles notoriously associated with his reign at WB.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, seems to be taking his revenge on the American Academy of Pediatrics for defying him. A report from the Washington Post on Wednesday revealed that HHS has abruptly revoked millions in federal funding from the non-profit organization.

According to documents obtained by the Washington Post, HHS has pulled seven grants to the AAP, including some related to studying autism and sudden infant deaths. The AAP has regularly criticized RFK Jr. this year for making changes to the country's vaccine policies unbacked by evidence. Just this week, HHS officially endorsed the end of a decades-long recommendation to universally vaccinate children against hepatitis B starting at birth.

“The sudden withdrawal of these funds will directly impact and potentially harm infants, children, youth, and their families in communities across the United States,” Mark Del Monte, AAP's CEO and executive vice president, said in a statement to the Washington Post.

In documents viewed by the Post, HHS provided several reasons for the funding cuts.

For instance, the agency took issue that some of the grants were being used for research projects that contained “identity-based language.” In another case, the funded research purportedly didn't focus enough on nutrition and chronic disease prevention—areas that Kennedy has claimed his HHS is emphasizing more than ever before.

‘We Are Doing Harm': RFK Jr.'s ACIP Guts Universal Hep B Vaccination at Birth

The AAP isn't the only group that's lost funding as of late. In a statement to the Post, a HHS spokesperson said that the AAP grants and others were revoked for no longer aligning “with the Department's mission or priorities.”

Of course, it's no secret that the AAP and RFK Jr. aren't exactly on the best of terms these days. On Wednesday, for instance, the organization and others were in federal court as part of an ongoing lawsuit against Kennedy. The AAP is arguing that RFK's unilateral decision to remove the covid-19 vaccine from the CDC-recommended immunization schedules for children and pregnant women runs afoul of federal law.

While the decision to freeze out the AAP might be Kennedy's most egregious yet, he's caused plenty of harm throughout the year.

‘Irreparably Damaged': Former Senior Official Details the Darkest Days of the CDC Under RFK Jr.

The AAP, and many other experts, have also lambasted RFK Jr. for hijacking the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, for instance. Earlier this June, Kennedy fired all 17 members of the previous ACIP and installed his own allies, many of whom—like Kennedy—have a track record of misrepresenting the risks of vaccination. Susan Monarez, the former CDC director, has alleged she was fired in August this year for refusing to accept, without review, the recommendations of the new ACIP; several senior CDC officials resigned in protest following her firing.

Without any adults in the room, Kennedy has continued to run roughshod over the country's public health system. Over the last few weeks, he's pushed the CDC to boost the debunked link between vaccines and autism, endorsed conspiracies about Lyme disease, and tried to blame antidepressants for causing mass shootings despite next to little evidence supporting such a link.

The AAP might be the latest health organization to earn the ire of RFK Jr., but it probably won't be the last.

In 2025, the first Star Wars streaming show, The Mandalorian, crossed one billion hours streamed, and May 4, Star Wars Day, was the busiest day of the year on Disney+. Those stats would lead you to believe that Star Wars is dominating streaming and, therefore, the world. But not so fast.

This week, Disney released a slew of self-congratulatory stats about its streaming services. Among the standouts are the two Star Wars-related ones mentioned above. But, also, Bluey was the most-watched series of the year with 26.5 million rewatches. Moana 2 was the biggest movie of the year, with over 80 million rewatches, and Alien: Earth was FX's biggest premiere on streaming, racking up over 100 million hours of viewing total.

But let's focus on Star Wars because, at least for the past six years, Star Wars has exclusively been a streaming franchise.

The Mandalorian was one of several big-name shows or movies that reached a billion hours streamed this year (The Golden Girls, Encanto, Malcolm in the Middle, Law and Order: SVU, Family Guy, and Futurama are just a few of the others). However, it's the only Star Wars show on there. Is that because it has the most episodes and has been around the longest? Of course. But, you'd think a franchise as big as Star Wars would have a little more representation. They've made Boba Fett shows. They've made Obi-Wan Kenobi shows. But nothing touches the original.

You'd especially think there would be more billion-hour Star Wars streamers because Star Wars Day, May 4, was Disney+'s biggest streaming day of the year. Disney didn't release any specifics of what, exactly, was streamed on that day (it did use Andor as the art, though), but it's safe to assume that a lot of it was Star Wars. Surely that means Star Wars shows, movies, animation, everything, all wrapped into one. Which is probably a big reason why, a few years ago, Disney announced its next Star Wars movie is based on that content: The Mandalorian and Grogu.

So, let's look at The Mandalorian and Grogu. The film opens on May 22, 2026, and released its first trailer back in September. Since then, the official Star Wars YouTube version of the trailer has 10 million views. Which sounds impressive until you look at something more recent, like last week's Supergirl trailer. That's only been out a week and has over 20 million views.

Is DC two times as popular as Star Wars? Obviously not. But fans might be two times as excited to see a new, big-screen DC adventure than a movie based on a TV show they've already watched for, literally, a billion hours.

Basically, what we're saying is, Star Wars needs a boost, even if some of its stats are impressive. Will that be The Mandalorian and Grogu? Will we have to wait for 2027 and a new Star Wars movie, as well as the original film's re-release? We don't know. But maybe as fans wait for new Star Wars content, they'll circle back to things they've missed. Things that, we think, are actually pretty great. Shows like The Acolyte, Skeleton Crew, or Star Wars Visions.

What are your thoughts on the streaming success of Star Wars? Let us know below.

The memory shortage has made PC gaming untenable to all but those with extremely deep pockets. Soon, the skyrocketing price of RAM and storage could stymie any hope of maintaining a semblance of physically owning your games. Nowhere is this more concerning than with the Nintendo Switch 2. The console's game cards may eventually become a rarity—or merely a collector's item.

According to Nintendeal, which has a relatively reliable track record reporting on Nintendo products, there are smaller Switch 2 game card sizes now in production, though it would still take time for them to actually become available to developers. Game developers have anonymously suggested that the only size available to them was an expensive 64GB game card. These newly developed smaller game cards could not have come at a worse time. Memory costs are ballooning across every industry, and it means game publishers have far fewer reasons to pay for physical game cards when there are cheaper options available.

The Switch 2 supports three distinct ways to buy games (four, if you count the dreaded “code in a box,” which is just a piece of paper where a cartridge should be). First is the digital copy that remains connected to a Nintendo account. The next is a traditional game card that includes the whole title stored on ROM flash memory. The last and most controversial is a game-key card, a physical card with very little storage inside. They instead act as a “key” (hence the name game-key card) for the Switch 2 to download the game. And then after downloading the game you ostensibly bought, you can only play it when it's inserted into the console. It's truly the worst of both worlds.

Game-key cards are more attractive to publishers since they cost less to purchase. They also let publishers get away with larger file sizes (some devs have claimed their games simply won't work with a physical game card). The more storage a game card has, the more it costs publishers. Publisher Inin wrote in a blog post this week regarding demands for a physical copy of its Switch 2 port of R-Type Dimensions III. The company claimed a physical run of cartridges would force the company to increase the cost of its game by 15 euros, or close to $18.

AI data centers have created a massive demand for memory, and they're willing to pay so much that the major memory makers across the semiconductor industry have shifted focus to make sure our chatbots keep chatting. The shortage in memory will only get worse going into 2026. Some companies have suggested we may not see an end to the shortage until 2028. Nintendo may be able to eat the cost with its first-party games, but smaller publishers and the memory makers themselves will have a much tougher time.

Things are about to get technical, so bear with me. Past teardowns from YouTuber Spawn Wave showed us the new Switch 2 game cards are made by Japanese semiconductor company Rohm. Nintendo Patent Watch, a Bluesky account and blog that has been tracking the game card situation, suggested that Taiwanese brand Macronix—which previously made original Switch game cards—may be one of the few companies making the smaller flash memory for Switch 2.

The company's last financial report from October suggested it expected ROM and NAND sales to pick up going into next year. A report earlier this year from Chinese-language outlet UAnalyze suggested Macronix would switch to using a type of NAND memory for lower-end Switch 2 cards.

Smaller ROM storage will be slower, according to Nintendeal. This means you may only see smaller indie titles use the tinier game cards. Indie devs will have a much harder time justifying the price of cards with ballooning prices.

Cameron Crandall, the datacenter SSD business manager for memory maker Kingston, told the host of the Full Nerd Network podcast that NAND flash storage will get way, way worse in the next 30 days. Kingston reported that NAND prices have soared by 246% compared to the beginning of 2025. “We're going to have price increases unlike we've ever seen in the past,” Crandall said.

Past data showed close to half of original Switch games sold were physical. Compare that to PlayStation 5 games, where nearly 80% are digital sales. For a more recent example, nearly 75% of Cyberpunk 2077's early sales on Switch 2 were for the physical copy. The Switch 2 may end up costing more next year due to the ongoing memory shortage, so it wouldn't surprise us if games follow suit. As much as gamers want them, we may see physical games get rarer and rarer. So long to the age of actually owning the games you buy.

Racing wheels turn casual driving games into real-life experiences where every turn, brake, and acceleration feels real instead of just pressing buttons. The good news is that the Logitech G29 racing wheel and the floor pedals are now $199 on Amazon, down from their regular price of $329 and this is the lowest price we've seen since Cyber Monday, which makes it the perfect surprise gift for PlayStation or PC gamers this holiday season. The force feedback, leather-wrapped steering, metal paddle shifters, and pressure-sensitive pedals on this wheel make it feel like you're really driving in games like Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsport, and F1 2026.

See at Amazon

The dual-motor force feedback system sends realistic vibrations and resistance through the steering wheel that match what's happening on the virtual road surface. When you turn hard, you can feel the wheel pull left or right as your tires lose grip. When you drive over curbs or rough pavement, you can feel the vibrations. This physical feedback makes a connection between you and the virtual car that controllers can't make and turns racing from a visual exercise into a tactile one.

The wheel can turn two and a half full turns from lock to lock which is the same as the steering ratio of real cars. This is better than the game controller's overly sensitive steering. This realistic range means that when you make wide turns, you really turn the wheel hand-over-hand, just like you would in a real car and builds muscle memory that works for both gaming and real driving. Racing games know about this longer rotation and change their steering models to match which means that the wheel movement in your hands matches exactly what you see on screen, with no fake acceleration or dead zones.

The G29 is more than just a toy racing wheel because it is made of high-quality materials and for example, the steering wheel rim is covered in hand-stitched leather. The leather feels good in your hands for long periods of time and does a better job of keeping your hands dry than rubber or foam, and the stainless steel paddle shifters behind the wheel make a satisfying clicking sound when you shift gears. Because they are made of metal, they will survive thousands of quick shifts during intense racing without bending or breaking.

There are three pedals in the pedal set: one for gas, one for the brake, and one for the clutch. The brake pedal has nonlinear resistance that gets stronger as you push harder. This pressure-sensitive braking works like real brake pedals and helps you learn how to control your brakes precisely for trail-braking into corners or threshold braking without locking your wheels.

There are action buttons on the wheel face and a directional pad for navigating the menu, so the button layout has all the basic controls. The wheel has buttons that are only for PlayStation functions, so you can get to system menus and game-specific features without having to reach for a controller. This full integration means that the racing wheel is no longer just an extra accessory that you have to switch out with a regular controller.

Logitech's G Hub app lets you change the strength of force feedback, the sensitivity of the steering, and the mapping of the buttons to fit your needs or the needs of a specific game. Different racing games need different levels of force feedback, so being able to fine-tune these settings makes sure that all of your games feel their best. You can also make profiles for each game that load automatically, so you don't have to change the settings every time you switch between Gran Turismo and Assetto Corsa.

The platform compatibility includes PS5, PS4, PC, and Mac which means that most racing game players can use it without any of the problems that some racing wheels have. It only takes a few minutes to set up with a simple USB connection, and both PlayStation consoles and PCs recognize the wheel right away without having to install drivers. The wheel won't work with Xbox systems, so people who own an Xbox Series or Xbox One should look at the G923 model instead.

At $199 instead of $329, you're saving $130 on a racing wheel that delivers great features at a price that previously bought entry-level options with basic force feedback and plastic construction. Budget racing wheels under $150 typically sacrifice build quality, force feedback strength, or pedal precision, while premium options from Thrustmaster and Fanatec easily exceed $500 or $600 for comparable feature sets.

The Sherman mega-site started production three and a half years after breaking ground.

Texas Instruments just started producing 300mm wafers at its Sherman, Texas facility, as SM1, the first of four fabs, have come online. According to the company's press release, it has started delivering chips from this site to its customers and that's it's ready to ramp up output to tens of millions of chips daily. This plant is part of the $60 billion investment into U.S. semiconductor manufacturing the company announced earlier this year, with the second SM2 fab also already underway. TI is investing $40 billion in the four Sherman fabs. Even though the Sherman site broke ground three and a half years ago, its opening is still a major milestone for the U.S. semiconductor industry.

“The start of production at our newest wafer fab in Sherman, Texas, represents what TI does best: owning every part of the manufacturing process to deliver the foundational semiconductors that are vital for nearly every type of electronic system,” Texas Instruments President and CEO Haviv Ilan said. “As the largest analog and embedded processing semiconductor manufacturer in the U.S., TI is uniquely positioned to provide dependable 300mm semiconductor manufacturing capacity at scale.”

 




The SM1 fab will not produce cutting edge semiconductors used in advanced computing products like the ones produced by Intel, Samsung, and TSMC. Instead, it will focus on chips used for power systems, such as the ones used in batteries for vehicles and electronic devices, automotive lighting, and data center power systems. “We're pushing the limits with our power portfolio — to drive new levels of power density, to extend battery life with lower standby power, and to reduce EMI signature, shortening the time to EMI compliance which helps make systems even safer no matter the voltage,” Texas Instruments senior vice president for analog power products Mark Gary said. “Our newest Sherman fab will have an immediate market impact, and it's exciting to think about how these first products will transform technology.”

Just two months ago, Texas Instruments started laying off employees from its older plants that produced 150mm wafers as the company has started to wind down their operations. The SM1 fab produces 300mm wafers, which offer four times the area compared to the older wafer. This gives the company better efficiency, as it can produce significantly more chips per run, and is the current industry standard when it comes to semiconductors. While it's unclear whether the 183 affected workers were moved to the new Sherman plant, the company claims that it will have as many as 3,000 direct jobs, and that the laid off staff would be given priority for these job opportunities.

If you can get this particular unit for $100, it represents one of the cheapest methods to get into PC gaming, as long as you are willing to do some tweaking.

With the reintroduction of the Steam Machine, DIY enthusiasts have been having fun making their own versions of Valve's console, often using standard PC components and Bazzite; a Fedora-based distro that resembles Valve's own SteamOS. However, this latest homebrewed Steam Machine creation is quite unique. Handheld/SFF enthusiast YouTube Channel ETA Prime showed off a DIY Steam machine setup using a mining blade that uses a B-grade PS5 SoC.

The hardware being used for this setup is an ASRock BC-250 mining blade that takes advantage of a defective PS5 SoC with disabled bits. Specs consist of six Zen 2 cores with 12 threads, 24 RDNA 2 CUs, and 16GB of GDDR6 memory. Compared to the base PS5, which has eight Zen 2 cores and 36 CUs, the neutered counterpart in ASRock's mining board has 25% fewer cores and 33% fewer GPU cores.

Thanks to crypto mining becoming mostly niche and requiring dedicated ASICs to churn out profitable income, ETA Prime reports that ASRock BC-250 boards are showing up all over eBay for prices as low as $100-$120. We can confirm the YouTuber's findings, but not the price. The lowest price we could find for a BC-250 on eBay was around $150.

Despite having two-thirds the GPU performance of a base PS5, ETA Prime discovered the BC-250 mining board performs adequately as a DIY Steam machine for 1080p gaming. After overclocking the GPU to 2000MHz, their benchmarks saw the SoC running Left 4 Dead 2 at well over 150 FPS at 1080p with max settings, Spider-Man 2 running at around 60 FPS at 1080p medium settings with FSR set to Balanced, The Witcher 3 running at around 75 FPS at 1080p with high settings, and Forza Horizon 5 running at around 80 FPS at 1080p medium settings. Cyberpunk 2077 was able to hit almost 60 FPS on average at 1080p with medium settings, as well.

However, being optimized for a server environment, the BC-250 does have some weird quirks. ETA Prime had to update the BIOS to a custom version to make it work as a gaming machine, and the board only has a single slow PCIe 2.0 x2 M.2 slot, limiting storage options. The board is also incompatible with standard PC cases and cooling solutions; however, you can find cases that work with the BC-250 for around $50 on eBay (at the time of writing).

If you can get around these issues, ETA Prime's work reveals that the BC-250 represents one of the cheapest methods to get into PC gaming right now. All in all, you are probably looking at a $200-$300 machine accounting for SSD storage and a power supply (though some BC-250 eBay listings include a PSU). The best part about this budget setup is that it includes 16GB of GDDR6 memory, making the outgoing RAM pricing crisis completely irrelevant.

A barely perceptible keystroke delay was the smoking gun that led to the uncovering of a malign imposter.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A North Korean imposter was uncovered, working as a sysadmin at Amazon U.S., after their keystroke input lag raised suspicions with security specialists at the online retail giant. Normally, a U.S.-based remote worker's computer would send keystroke data within tens of milliseconds. This suspicious individual's keyboard lag was “more than 110 milliseconds,” reports Bloomberg.

Amazon is commendably proactive in its pursuit of impostors, according to the source report. The news site talked with Amazon's Chief Security Officer, Stephen Schmidt, about this fascinating new case of North Koreans trying to infiltrate U.S. organizations to raise hard currency for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), and sometimes indulge in espionage and/or sabotage.

Schmidt says that Amazon has foiled more than 1,800 DPRK infiltration attempts since April 2024. Moreover, the rate of attempts continues apace, with Amazon reckoning it is seeing a 27% QoQ uplift in North Koreans trying to get into the Amazon corporation.

However, Amazon's success can be almost entirely credited to the fact that it is actively looking for DPRK impostors, warns its Chief Security Officer. “If we hadn't been looking for the DPRK workers,” Schmidt said, “we would not have found them.”

With this company policy explained, a blip on the Amazon security radar was caused earlier this year when a new sysadmin's Amazon laptop monitor alerted security personnel about unusual behavior.

Amazon security experts took a closer look at the flagged ‘U.S. remote worker' and determined that their remote laptop was being remotely controlled – causing the extra keystroke input lag. Schmidt emphasizes that good-quality security software was key to this investigation.

It turns out that the DPRK had access to this Amazon laptop located in Arizona. A woman found to be facilitating this fraud on behalf of North Korean imposter workers was sentenced to several years in prison earlier this year.

As well as red flag computer network symptoms, the fumbling use of American idioms and English-language articles continues to be a giveaway when conversing with such impostors.

The problem of North Koreans infiltrating U.S. corporations for profit, mischief, and more is undoubtedly a serious one. We've covered sizable FBI seizures of equipment recently, perhaps showing just the tip of the iceberg. More successful infiltrations by the DPRK, as well as hostile nations like Iran, Russia, and China, are likely to be ongoing.

While its specs aren't wildly different from those of the original SoloCast, it has a brand-new build that feels much sturdier, features a clever built-in stand, and adds a large tap-to-mute button on top. Not bad for $60 (available now, in black).

 




While the original SoloCast looked like a pretty traditional condenser microphone, the SoloCast 2 is a sleek, solid black cylinder with a novel built-in stand. HyperX's second-generation budget-friendly USB microphone is a pretty neat-looking update: the mic is housed in a matte-black plastic chassis that measures 6 inches (152.4mm) long by 2.08 inches (53mm) in diameter. The upper half of the cylinder features a matte black metal grille with HyperX's signature honeycomb pattern. Under this grille, there's a foam pop filter and an internal shock mount — the 14mm electret condenser capsule is suspended inside the chassis to prevent any interference from desk vibrations (as it is, after all, a desktop microphone).

The SoloCast 2 might look like a solid cylinder, but it's actually got a unique, integrated desktop stand. There's a hinge at the back of the cylinder that lets you tilt the microphone back 40 degrees — angling it so it's directed at your face, if you're sitting at a desk. That stand part of the cylinder is nice and hefty — the full unit weighs about 12.9 ounces (365.7g), and the bottom is lined with non-skid rubber material just to guarantee the mic isn't slipping around your desk.

 




There's a bright red indicator light at the bottom of the mic (tilting the mic up also angles this light toward your face, so you won't miss it) that tells you whether the mic is muted or recording. It's red when the mic is recording, which threw me off... quite a bit, honestly, as many gaming microphones with RGB lighting default to red when they're muted. I realize that red for recording makes sense, and that red is HyperX's color, and that this is an issue most users will not have. But, still.

Aside from its neat little built-in stand, the SoloCast 2 is pretty simple. There's a large, flat, tap-to-mute surface on the top of the mic — I'd expect nothing less from HyperX, as this is definitely my favorite feature, and there's a USB-C port on the back of the mic, near the hinge. On the bottom, there's a mounting point that's compatible with both 3/8"" and 5/8"" threaded mounts, so you can fold the microphone up and mount it — stand and all — on a boom arm or mic stand.

 




The SoloCast 2 is a simple, straightforward mic with a built-in stand, so it includes only one accessory in the box — a 6.5-foot (2m) USB-C to USB-A cable.

The SoloCast 2 records sound at a high-res 24-bit / 96 kHz bit-depth / sample rate (recording studio level), but so does the original SoloCast thanks to a firmware update HyperX pushed out in 2022. Like the original SoloCast, the SoloCast 2 has a cardioid polar pattern — perfect for one speaker located directly in front of the mic.

 




This is essentially a plug-n-play mic, and it sounds pretty good out of the box. Vocals sound full and rounded, though not quite as clean as they sound on the Logitech Yeti Orb. My voice had a decent amount of depth and detail in both recordings and streams, and the mic also offers a nice proximity effect (though the built-in stand is too low for this to be comfortable). The SoloCast 2 has a built-in internal shock mount and pop filter, but they're both on the weaker side: the mic picked up both desk movement and plosives very, very easily in my testing. In other words, we definitely recommend mounting this mic on a boom arm.

The mic does pick up a lot of background noise — my fans were ever-present in my testing, but vocals still came across strong and clear. There are some settings you can tweak in HyperX's Ngenuity Beta software that work pretty well to reduce noise and clean up the sound in general, but that has its own issues. However, mounting the mic on a boom arm did a lot to at least reduce any noise from desk movement and typing.

The SoloCast 2 works with HyperX's Ngenuity Beta software, which gives you a handful of options for adjusting the mic's tone. This is where you can adjust the mic's gain (there's no on-mic gain control, unfortunately), and turn on a handful of software-based improvements, such as high / low pass filters and AI noise reduction.

 




You can also adjust the mic's sound using a simple 10-band equalizer. You can add and save as many EQ presets as you want; the software doesn't come with any built-in presets.

 




It's important to point out that the Ngenuity Beta software is definitely still in beta. The settings do not save to the microphone; they don't even save to the software. So the frequency filters, noise reduction, and EQ will only work when the software is running. (The software does save EQ presets, but you'll need to turn the EQ on and select the preset every time you open it.) I assume this will be fixed at some point, but there's no timeline at the moment.

The SoloCast 2 isn't the most exciting microphone on the market, but it's pretty impressive for $60. It's a solid follow-up to HyperX's original SoloCast, with a much sturdier build and a tap-to-mute button that the original was definitely lacking. At $60, it's the same price as the Logitech Yeti Orb (the Yeti Orb debuted at $60 in 2023 and received a price increase to $70, but is currently back at $60 on sale). While I do like the Yeti Orb's out-of-the-box sound better, the SoloCast 2's tap-to-mute is a much more convenient feature — especially as the Yeti Orb has no on-mic controls. Assuming you're using this mic for more casual chatting with friends, teammates, and coworkers, this is likely to be pretty essential (so long as you remember that red means recording).

Canadian teenagers and young adults who use pre-workout dietary supplements are likely to get too little sleep, potentially jeopardizing their health, researchers say.

Sleep is particularly important for young people, “who are going through significant physiological, psychological, and cognitive development,” Kyle T. Ganson, PhD, of the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work at the University of Toronto in Toronto, told Medscape News Canada.

“Ironically,” he noted, “adolescents and young adults may turn to pre-workout supplements to support and catalyze their workout, but that may come at the risk of losing critical hours of sleep, which is necessary for rejuvenating energy levels, overall recovery, and muscle repair.

“One of the key findings of the study is that adolescents and young adults require between 7 and 10 hours of sleep per night, and we found that those who used [pre-workout supplements] have 5 or fewer hours,” Ganson said.

The study was published on December 3 in Sleep Epidemiology.

The researchers analyzed data from 912 participants in Wave 2 of the Canadian Study of Adolescent Behaviors. They used multinomial logistic regression analyses to investigate the cross-sectional association between the use of pre-workout dietary supplements in the past 12 months and average sleep duration in the past 2 weeks.

Pre-workout use (any/none) was assessed with the question, “Over the past 12 months, have you used any of the following appearance- and performance-enhancing dietary supplements and substances?” with “pre-workout drinks or powders” listed as a response option.

Average sleep duration was self-reported based on the question, “In the past 2 weeks, how many hours per night did you sleep on average?”

The sample was demographically diverse. The mean age was 23.4 years. More than half of participants (57.4%) identified as girls or young women. Nearly two thirds (62.2%) identified as White, and 55.1% identified as heterosexual.

About one third of participants (34.9%) reported averaging 7 hours of sleep per night over the past 2 weeks. More than one fifth (22.2%) reported using pre-workout supplements in the past 12 months.

The data were adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, highest completed education, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score, General Anxiety Disorder-7 score, and any weight training in the past 30 days.

Adolescents and young adults who reported using pre-workout dietary supplements were more than twice as likely to report 5 hours or less of average sleep per night as those who did not, relative to 8 hours of sleep. The relative risk ratio was 2.53.

“Findings underscore that the high caffeine content of pre-workout dietary supplements is associated with shorter sleep durations that are well below the recommended guidelines for adolescents and young adults,” the authors wrote.

“These products commonly contain large doses of caffeine — anywhere between 90 and over 350 mg of caffeine — more than a can of Coke (which has roughly 35 mg) and a cup of coffee (with about 100 mg),” said Ganson. “Our results suggest that pre-workout use may contribute to inadequate sleep, which is critical for healthy development, mental well-being, and academic functioning.”

The authors noted several limitations of the study. The sample was collected via social media, and participants self-selected their involvement in the data collection, which limited the generalizability of the findings.

The study also had relatively high attrition. No details were provided on the dose, frequency, and timing of pre-workout supplement use, or the various formulations — all of which might affect sleep duration.

Despite these limitations, the authors concluded that “health and mental health care professionals should provide education and guidance on the potential adverse effects that pre-workout use can have on sleep duration if consumed too close to bedtime.” They also recommended providing sleep hygiene information, particularly given the importance of sleep for athletic performance and muscle building.

Young people should be informed about the safety and efficacy of these dietary supplements, Ganson said. “Just because they are easy to purchase and readily available doesn't necessarily mean they are effective and safe.”

“We are sleeping less and stimulating or caffeinating ourselves more, and this study shows the massive impact of stimulant use on sleep,” Alex Dimitriu, MD, founder of Menlo Park Psychiatry & Sleep Medicine in Menlo Park, California, told Medscape News Canada.

While his younger clientele doesn't often report use of pre-workout supplements, many are using caffeine and other stimulants, including prescription methylphenidate, he said. These patients “get into loops of fatigue requiring stimulants, then that impairs sleep. They get insufficient sleep and then need more stimulants — most often, coffee.”

Dimitriu said more research is needed to assess specific products, caffeine doses, and timing of use. “However, even globally, the association of decreased sleep with workout enhancers appears strong.”

He also cited a recent study published online in Nature, in which the authors assessed sleep and activity (measured in steps). “Sleep improved the next day's physical activity substantially,” Dimitriu said. So, patients may be told, “Before taking more coffee or a workout enhancer, get some sleep. It's natural, and it's good for you, at any stage of life.”

This study was funded by the Connaught New Researcher Award at the University of Toronto. Ganson and Dimitriu reported no relevant financial relationships.

In adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), a reduction in BMI during intentional weight loss was associated with a reduced risk for retinopathy, neuropathy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and peripheral artery disease (PAD), regardless of changes in A1c levels.

""Overall, this study highlights the potential benefit of a combined approach to actively reduce both BMI and HbA1c [A1c] in people living with T2D to further reduce the risk of complications and healthcare system burden associated with the management of these conditions,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Akshay Jain, MD, TLC Diabetes and Endocrinology, Surrey, British Columbia, Canada. It was published online on December 10, 2025, in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism.

This study used retrospective data from routine care, which often had missing or incorrect entries and inconsistent documentation across settings. The requirement for both a baseline and a 4-year BMI and A1c record likely introduced selection bias towards higher-risk or more closely monitored patients. Uncertainty may have existed, particularly at higher magnitudes of weight loss.

This study was funded by Novo Nordisk. Four authors reported being employees of Novo Nordisk A/S. One author reported receiving grants/research support from multiple companies; speakers bureau/honoraria from numerous organisations, including WebMD; and consulting fees from several companies.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

Organized labor has made inroads with the nursing profession in recent years, and a Medscape survey learned that about 1 in 7 nurses now belong to a union or collective bargaining unit. Around 1 in 10 who don't said union organizing efforts, or at least discussions, are under way at work. Nurses also described their peers' attitude toward unions.

This infographic presents insights from a newly published report on the state of union organization in the nursing profession in the US. To learn more, check out the Medscape Future of Nurse Unions Report 2025.

The US FDA said it will move quickly to add bemotrizinol — which has been approved in Europe for 25 years — as a generally recognized safe and effective ingredient for use in sunscreens for adults and children aged 6 years or older.

The agency has not allowed any new sunscreen ingredient since 1999. It was directed by a new law signed in November to remove some hurdles — chief among them, some animal testing requirements — that had been discouraging manufacturers from seeking US approval of their ingredients.

The agency announced its intention to add bemotrizinol for use as a sunscreen active ingredient at concentrations up to 6% in a publication in the Federal Register. “The agency has historically moved too slowly in this area, leaving Americans with fewer options than consumers abroad,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, MD, MPH, said in a statement.

DSM-Firmenich had originally sought FDA approval in 2018 for bemotrizinol (PARSOL Shield) and resubmitted data in late 2024 and was anticipating approval even before the FDA announcement. In an interview in November, Carl D'Ruiz, business development manager, Beauty and Care Business North America, told Medscape Medical News that the company expected the ingredient to be approved in June.

The agency said that its review found that bemotrizinol provides protection against both ultraviolet A and B rays, has low levels of absorption, and rarely causes skin irritation.

In the FDA statement, Karen Murry, MD, acting director of FDA's Office of Nonprescription Drugs, said, “we look forward to working with other companies on bringing products containing other new active ingredients to market for a wide array of conditions in multiple therapeutic areas, in a much more timely fashion than was possible in the past.”

The American Academy of Dermatology Association said in a statement that it applauded the agency's proposal. “If approved, this new sunscreen ingredient will expand the sunscreen options available to the public and greatly benefit public health,” the statement said.

Dermatologist Deborah S. Sarnoff, MD, president of The Skin Cancer Foundation, told Medscape Medical News in an emailed statement that if bemotrizinol is approved, it will “expand public access to an innovative, safe, and effective UV filter that has been available in other countries for some time.”

“It is our sincere hope that more sunscreen choices will then lead to more sunscreen use because all of the choices in the world will have little impact if Americans do not apply sunscreen on a daily basis,” said Sarnoff.

The FDA is seeking public comments on the proposal through January 26.

A statement from DSM-Firmenich, issued on December 16, said that when the FDA issues its expected final order in June 2026, bemotrizinol (PARSOL Shield) will be available for use. The company added that availability in the US “will also depend on manufacturers' formulation and labeling cycles, but we anticipate product launches could begin shortly after the final order is effective.”

The phase 3 lidERA trial showed that giredestrant improved invasive disease‑free survival and distant recurrence‑free interval with a favorable safety profile. The EMBER-3 study found that endocrine therapy plus abemaciclib significantly improved progression‑free survival vs chemotherapy in patients with metastatic high‑tumor‑burden, treatment‑naive disease, challenging routine upfront chemotherapy.

EPIK‑B5 confirmed that alpelisib plus fulvestrant benefits patients with PIK3CA‑mutant metastatic disease, who previously received CDK4/6 inhibitors, supporting SOLAR‑1 findings.

Parents' perceptions of their children's food allergies (FAs) may result in feelings of living with constant risk for exposure, beliefs that the allergy is long-term and insurmountable, and the strain of feeling that they need to control and monitor their child's eating.

Those feelings can lead to parental anxiety, fear, and increased risk for social isolation that can be passed onto the child, affecting the quality of life (QoL) for the entire family. Authors led by Psychologist Laura Polloni, PsyD, with the Food Allergy Referral Centre, at Padua University Hospital, in Padua, Italy, detailed how the perceptions affect the family in a study published in Children.

“It is crucial to understand and explore illness perception, as well as focus on psychosocial-emotional aspects of FA in both children and parents,” the authors wrote. “A multidisciplinary approach that addresses the medical and psychological aspects of FA should be implemented to ensure adequate QoL.” 

This cross-sectional study included 79 parents of children (3-12 years) with a diagnosis of immunoglobulin E-mediated FA, who completed the Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire - Parent Form, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (B-IPQ). Parents were recruited during their children's outpatient visits at the Food Allergy Referral Centre of the Veneto Region sequentially over 6 months.

The authors noted that the B-IPQ can be given easily at routine allergy appointments to understand and monitor FA's effect on patients and caregivers.

The authors found that a child's QoL was lower the more allergies a child had, and that mental health difficulties and the way parents perceived the child's illness also were factors affecting the child's QoL. And a lower QoL “can further worsen the emotional and relational well-being of patients and families, creating a vicious circle,” the authors noted.

“While the medical risks of food allergy, particularly anaphylaxis, are well studied, the psychosocial and perceptual dimensions are still comparatively underexplored in routine care,” Payel Gupta, MD, with the Allergy & Asthma Network told Medscape Medical News.

In practice, psychosocial burden and perceptions of disease severity can mean families avoid social activities, restrict travel, or experience ongoing anxiety that affects parental well-being and the child's emotional development, she said. “Over time, this hypervigilance can become exhausting and isolating, even when the allergy itself is medically well managed.”

One common misperception by parents is that FA is a permanent, uncontrollable condition that will inevitably get worse or lead to severe outcomes, Gupta said. The paper shows that when parents perceive the allergy as having a long timeline and overwhelming consequences, children tend to have lower QoL scores, she said. “Another misperception is that complete avoidance is the only marker of good management, which can unintentionally limit normal childhood experiences. These beliefs often stem from fear rather than medical reality,” she added.

To address these misperceptions, early intervention should go beyond emergency preparedness and include evidence-based education on risk and management with explicit discussion of illness perceptions, Gupta said, adding that she agrees with the authors that tools such as the B-IPQ can help.

In some cases, she said, referral for psychological support or structured education programs can be effective in reducing anxiety and improving overall family QoL.

This study “reinforces that food allergy should be understood as a family condition, not just an individual diagnosis,” Gupta said. “By identifying illness perception as a modifiable factor, the study points toward practical opportunities for clinicians to reduce burden, not by changing the allergy itself, but by changing how families understand and live with it.”

The authors and Gupta reported no relevant financial relationships.

The FDA has approved a label change on the long-acting injectable contraceptive depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, commonly known as Depo-Provera, to warn users of a potential risk of meningioma.

The FDA's action follows mounting scientific evidence linking the medication to meningioma, a type of tumor that forms in the lining surrounding the brain. 

A study published in March last year in The BMJ found a fivefold increased risk for meningiomas among patients taking Depo-Provera. 

A separate study published in JAMA Neurology in September and covered by Medscape Medical News found a twofold increased risk for meningiomas in Depo-Provera users. The risk was greatest in women who began using the injection after age 31 years or who used it for 4 years or more. 

The updated label applies to Depo-Provera CI (intramuscular injection) and Depo-SubQ Provera 104 (subcutaneous injection), both manufactured by Pfizer. 

It states that “cases of meningiomas have been reported following repeated administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate, primarily with long term use.” 

The label advises monitoring of patients on Depo-Provera CI for signs and symptoms of meningioma and discontinuing the medication if a meningioma is diagnosed. Depo-Provera is contraindicated in patients with a meningioma or a history of meningioma.

The United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation reports that more than 1400 lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer regarding Depo-Provera and meningiomas. 

Medscape Medical News reached out to Pfizer for comment but did not receive a response by press time.

Topline results from the ATTAIN-MAINTAIN trial show that orforglipron, an investigational oral GLP-1 receptor agonist, helps people maintain weight loss after switching from an injectable, Eli Lilly announced today.

The phase 3 placebo-controlled study evaluated orforglipron for weight maintenance over 52 weeks after initial treatment for 72 weeks with the highest tolerated doses of Wegovy (semaglutide) or Zepbound (tirzepatide), in participants from the SURMOUNT-5 study who were offered the opportunity to be re-randomized to receive orforglipron or placebo. 

SURMOUNT participants had overweight or obesity, but not diabetes, plus at least one of the following comorbidities: hypertension, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, or cardiovascular disease.

At 1 year, orforglipron met the primary and all key secondary endpoints compared to placebo, delivering superior weight maintenance as an adjunct to a healthy diet and physical activity in participants who achieved plateau with either Zepbound or Wegovy in SURMOUNT-5. Weight plateau was defined as < 5% body weight change between weeks 60 and 72 in SURMOUNT-5. 

Prespecified analyses at 52 weeks showed that participants who switched to orforglipron from Wegovy maintained their previously achieved weight loss with an average difference of 0.9 kg, whereas those who switched from Zepbound maintained their previously achieved weight loss with an average difference of 5.0 kg.

The ATTAIN-MAINTAIN trial randomized 376 participants in the US in a 3:2 ratio to receive either the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of orforglipron (24 mg or 36 mg) or placebo, as an adjunct to healthy diet and physical activity.

The primary endpoint was to demonstrate that orforglipron is superior to placebo in maintaining body weight reduction in participants who achieved plateau with either Zepbound or Wegovy in the SURMOUNT-5 trial. 

In ATTAIN-MAINTAIN, participants were randomized to once-daily orforglipron 12 mg (or matching placebo), which was increased every 4 weeks until the randomized maintenance dose of 36 mg or the MTD was reached. Participants who regained 50% or more of their body weight after SURMOUNT-5 were treated with rescue orforglipron MTD.

Post-hoc analyses at 24 weeks, the last time point before placebo participants were eligible for orforglipron as rescue therapy, showed the change in body weight from ATTAIN-MAINTAIN baseline for participants switching to orforglipron from Wegovy was -0.1 kg vs 9.4 kg for placebo. Similarly, for those switching to orforglipron from Zepbound, the change from baseline was 2.6 kg vs 9.1 kg for placebo.

As shown in previous orforglipron phase 3 trials, the most common adverse events were gastrointestinal-related and generally mild-to-moderate in severity. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events for participants randomized to placebo or orforglipron were 4.8% (orforglipron from Wegovy), 7.6% (placebo from Wegovy), 7.2% (orforglipron from Zepbound) and 6.3% (placebo from Zepbound). No hepatic safety signal was observed.

Lilly has submitted a new drug application to the FDA for orforglipron for treating adults with obesity or overweight, and the drug was granted a Commissioner's National Priority Voucher from the FDA. 

Lilly anticipates that orforglipron could receive approval for its first indication as early as next year, a spokesperson told Medscape Medical News.

After a moderate-to-severe traumatic injury, older adults with dementia had a higher likelihood of experiencing new limitations to activities of daily living than those without dementia. Older women with dementia were more likely to move from home to long-term care facilities post-injury.

“For older adults with dementia, traumatic injury represents a pivotal turning point where postacute care programs may buffer an otherwise steep trajectory of functional decline. As trauma systems increasingly serve aging patient populations impacted by cognitive impairment, targeted interventions aimed at preserving function and supporting patients with the resources required for independent living will be essential for improving outcomes after injury,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by Joshua E. Cohen of the Center for Surgery and Public Health at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. It was published online on December 14, 2025, in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.

The study's findings may not be generalizable to populations outside the Boston area. Potential selection bias may exist due to reliance on follow-up interviews, which could exclude patients with severe cognitive impairments. Differences in self-reporting vs caregiver reporting may introduce bias in assessing independence in activities of daily living.

In a cohort study of more than 1 million individuals, influenza vaccination between the ages of 40 and 50 years was not associated with decreased risk for incident Parkinson's disease compared with no vaccination.

“Temporary decreases in PD [Parkinson's disease] risk several years after vaccination and decreases in PD risk among those vaccinated during influenza season appear possible, although the respective findings did not reach statistical significance and thus require further investigation and replication,” the authors wrote. 

The study was led by Antonios Douros, MD, Institute of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Charité-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany. It was published online on December 5, 2025, in JAMA Network Open.

Because the study was observational, unmeasured confounders could have influenced the findings. Vaccine exposure may have been misclassified because records were obtained from routine primary care, potentially diluting any true effect. Additionally, Parkinson's diagnoses may have been misclassified.

No specific funding was reported. One author disclosed receiving personal fees from CSL Behring, Covis Pharma, Amgen, Novartis, and Panalgo, whereas another reported receiving grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

Each year, 11 million people worldwide develop tuberculosis, and about 1.4 million die from it. Meningitis occurs in 1–2% of patients and is the most severe complication of tuberculosis, arising when the bacteria reach the brain. Despite antibiotic treatment, about half of patients with TB meningitis die or suffer permanent damage such as deafness or paralysis.

In previous studies, we saw that very little rifampicin-the most important antibiotic against tuberculosis-reaches the brain. That means the bacteria are not effectively cleared there. But those studies also showed a link between higher dosing and reduced mortality. Based on that, we and many international researchers started investigating a higher dose of rifampicin.""

Rob Aarnoutse, hospital pharmacist, clinical pharmacologist, and professor 

Worldwide, several studies began examining the effects of higher rifampicin doses, and the first trial has now been completed. This study, co-designed by Radboudumc and conducted in Indonesia, Uganda, and South Africa, investigated whether a high dose of rifampicin could improve survival.

499 adults with tuberculous meningitis received the standard treatment of four antibiotics (isoniazid, rifampicin 10 mg/kg, pyrazinamide and ethambutol). Half also received an extra dose of rifampicin (up to 35 mg/kg), while the other half received a placebo for eight weeks. The average patient age was 37, and 60% were HIV-positive. Researchers assessed survival after six months.

The study found no evidence of a beneficial effect from high-dose rifampicin. In fact, some subgroups there appeared to be an increased risk of death. After six months, 44.6% of the high-dose group had died, compared to 40.7% in the standard group. 'The higher mortality seems to occur mainly in the first weeks after diagnosis', says researcher Reinout van Crevel, internist-infectiologist and professor at Radboudumc. Van Crevel has studied tuberculosis for 25 years, especially in Indonesia. He adds: 'It was, of course, disappointing that this is not the solution. But these are important results-we now know we need to take a different path. That's how science works.'

Follow-up studies at Radboudumc using stored blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples, led by biomedical scientist and toxicologist Lindsey te Brake, aim to uncover why high-dose rifampicin had no beneficial effect. Meanwhile, Van Crevel and colleagues are shifting focus from the tuberculosis bacteria to the inflammation in the brain membranes. 'Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and blood showed more inflammation in patients who died than in others. We suspect the protein TNF plays a key role. TNF helps clear bacteria but can also cause severe damage to the brain,' Van Crevel explains.

Current treatment with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs offers insufficient protection. There is an urgent need for therapies that better control this inflammatory response, possibly using TNF inhibitors.

Van Crevel: 'These drugs are sometimes used later in treatment of tuberculous meningitis when corticosteroids fail. We have had good experiences with them both here in our own TB center and in Jakarta. But no one has used TNF inhibitors at the start of treatment-when most patients die. That's what we will investigate in the next clinical trial.'

People with ADHD are at a higher risk of offending than those without an ADHD diagnosis. The same pattern appears among their relatives, according to a new study from örebro University. ""This suggests that both genetic and environmental factors within families may play a role,"" says researcher Sofi Oskarsson.

Using Swedish national registers, the researchers tracked more than 1.5 million people born between 1987 and 2002, linking medical ADHD diagnoses to official criminal records. They then compared the risk of convictions among individuals and between twins, full siblings, half-siblings, and cousins.

The findings indicate that individuals with ADHD are significantly more likely to be convicted of both violent crimes and other types of crimes. Relatives of those with ADHD also face a higher risk of conviction, even if they do not have ADHD.

The correlation is somewhat stronger among women than among men.

“Since ADHD is often detected later in women, the higher risk may mean that those who are diagnosed often have more severe symptoms,” says Sofi Oskarsson, a researcher in criminology at Örebro University.

The study, published in the journal Biological Psychiatry, is the largest to date to examine how ADHD and criminality co-vary within families across multiple levels.

The results highlight the importance of early identification and intervention for ADHD, particularly in families with a history of the condition. The researchers note that this can minimise the risk of adverse outcomes, such as criminal behaviour.

“Increased knowledge about the role of the family enables healthcare professionals to be more attentive to ADHD symptoms in relatives. This can help prevent impulsive and risky behaviour – and break patterns across generations,” says Sofi Oskarsson.

Preventive measures should target both genders and consider gender-specific needs and the additional challenges faced by women with ADHD, such as stigma and late diagnosis.

“Our research indicates that ADHD is not only a personal challenge but also part of a family-based risk profile. These insights are vital for developing early interventions and support that can lower the risk of criminal behaviour.”

The study was conducted in Sweden, a high-income country with universal healthcare and a relatively low proportion of prisoners. Cultural, legal, and organisational factors can influence both how ADHD is detected and the chances of being convicted of a crime. However, a systematic review of the global prevalence of ADHD indicates that levels are fairly comparable across regions.

“This suggests that our findings could also be applicable beyond the Western world. However, further research is necessary in underrepresented regions to determine if the same pattern holds elsewhere,” concludes Sofi Oskarsson.

MOG Antibody-associated Disease (MOGAD) is a rare autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. The blood of patients contains antibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), a protein in the myelin layer that surrounds the neurons in the brain. It is believed that these antibodies contribute to the destruction of this protective layer in the brain.

Researchers at the University Hospital Bonn (UKB) and the Universities of Basel and Bonn, in collaboration with Yale School of Medicine and the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), have now deciphered the construction plan of the anti-MOG antibodies. The researchers see their findings on the misdirected immune response, which have now been published in the journal Neurology® Neuroimmunology & Neuroinflammation, as the basis for developing specific MOGAD therapies.

MOGAD is a disease in which the immune system mistakenly produces antibodies that target the MOG protein. This presumably damages the protective myelin layer around nerve cells, leading to inflammation in the central nervous system. However, until now, it has been difficult to study the mechanisms that cause the disease because the structure of the anti-MOG antibodies was unknown. In regard to therapy, it is important to distinguish the autoimmune disease MOGAD, that occurs in episodes and can affect the brain, optic nerve and spinal cord, from multiple sclerosis (MS).

The international research team led by Prof. Anne-Katrin Pröbstel from the UKB and the Universities of Basel and Bonn succeeded in identifying MOG-reactive B cells, the antibody factories of the immune system, in patient blood. These contained the genetic instructions for the anti-MOG antibodies. ""Based on this alone, we were able to determine that MOG reactivity is present in different B cell subtypes,"" says Dr. Nora Wetzel, and Dr. Laila Kulsvehagen adds: ""For example, there are B cells that are specific to MOG from the outset, while other B cells only develop this reactivity as they mature."" The two co-first authors of the study belong to Prof. Pröbstel's research group.

The genetic code also allowed the researchers to produce the antibodies in the laboratory and test their functions. This revealed that the antibodies use various mechanisms to eliminate MOG-producing cells.

Interestingly, not all MOG antibodies were equally effective in using these different mechanisms. While this was partly due to the binding capacity of the antibodies, we suspect that the structural interaction between the MOG antigen and the antibody is relevant, especially for the activation of the immune cascade.""

Anne-Katrin Pröbstel, Director, Center for Neurology, University Hospital Bonn (UKB)


This study confirms previous work involving patient sera and brain autopsies, thus reinforcing the hypothesis that anti-MOG antibodies contribute to the development of the disease, known in technical terms as pathogenesis. Prof. Pröbstel emphasizes: ""The new understanding of the origin of MOG-reactive B cells and antibody functions is important for developing tailored therapies.""

As rates of obesity, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and sleep apnea increase, cases of advanced chronic liver disease and resulting liver scarring or cirrhosis also are rising. Patients often are diagnosed based on symptoms, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, fluid retention or jaundice, which happen when liver disease has progressed to a late stage. This problem led Mayo Clinic researchers to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model that resulted in twice the number of advanced chronic liver disease diagnoses in patients without symptoms, helping physicians treat them before the disease had progressed.

""Chronic liver disease is a progressive condition, so the sooner we can diagnose it, the sooner we can stop it from advancing to irreversible stages. Early intervention may decrease the likelihood that a patient will need a liver transplant in the future,"" says Doug Simonetto, M.D., a Mayo Clinic transplant hepatologist and lead author of the study published in Nature Medicine.

The heart and liver are closely linked. Liver scarring may lead to increased local pressure that can affect the heart. As a result, a heartbeat test called an electrocardiogram (ECG) can capture electrical signal changes in the heart connected to advanced liver disease. Dr. Simonetto and colleagues developed an AI model to analyze data from 11,513 Mayo Clinic patients undergoing routine ECGs. The model looked for patterns connected to advanced liver disease in the ECG data, and it found twice the number of patients who were diagnosed by standard methods. The diagnosis was confirmed by validated imaging or blood tests.

As a family physician, I've often seen how advanced liver disease - which frequently has no symptoms until it becomes irreversible - can go undetected. Many patients identified through the AI-ECG model had no idea they were living with advanced liver disease. By identifying these cases earlier, we were able to connect them to the right treatment - at a time when intervention can truly make a difference. For these patients, the technology helped us not only to uncover a diagnosis, it created an opportunity for better health outcomes and, in some cases, may have saved lives.""

David Rushlow, M.D., Mayo Clinic Health System family physician and study co-author

In this randomized clinical trial, 248 clinicians at Mayo Clinic in Rochester and throughout the Mayo Clinic Health System participated.

""The idea that a simple, noninvasive and inexpensive test could help identify patients at risk of developing advanced liver disease was very compelling. This study provided an opportunity to evaluate AI in our real-world clinical environment, where the true test of innovation is whether it improves care for patients in the community,"" says Dr. Rushlow. ""We're only beginning to understand the full potential of AI-enabled tools like this and the promise they hold for preventive, personalized care.""

In the next steps, the researchers will follow up with the patients, who were newly diagnosed with advanced liver disease, over the next two years.

The research is part of a larger effort at Mayo Clinic called the Precure initiative focused on developing tools that empower clinicians to predict and intercept biological processes before they evolve into disease or progress into complex, hard-to-treat conditions.

A new study finds menopause symptoms to be very frequently reported by female endurance athletes, with many perceiving a negative effect on their training and performance. The findings are published December 17, 2025 in the open-access journal PLOS One by Heather Hamilton of Old Dominion University, U.S., and colleagues.

Physical activity has been reported to mitigate the negative effects of menopause, particularly when it comes to musculoskeletal changes and quality of life. However, at the same time, menopausal symptoms may interfere with participation in physical activity and sport.

In the new study, researchers surveyed 187 female runners, cyclists, swimmers, and triathletes aged 40–60 years who participated in their sport at least 3 days per week for at least 3 hours total per week. Participants completed the Menopausal Rating Scale (MRS), a validated measure for assessing menopausal symptoms, and reported how symptoms affected their training and performance.

The researchers found that the most common menopausal symptoms among the athletes were sleep problems (reported by 88% of women), physical and mental exhaustion (83%), sexual problems (74%), anxiety (72%), irritability (68%), depressive mood (67%), weight gain (67%), hot flushes (65%), and joint and muscular discomfort (63%).

The symptoms perceived to most negatively affect training and performance were joint and muscular discomfort, weight gain, sleep problems, and physical and mental exhaustion. 97% of women with joint and musculoskeletal discomfort reported a negative effect on training and 91% reported a negative effect on performance, for example. Participants with more severe menopausal symptoms reported greater perceived negative effects on training and performance, with about a third of all respondents reporting that menopausal symptoms had a moderate or strong negative effect on training and about a quarter reporting a negative effect on performance.

The study is limited by its cross-sectional design and the lack of demographic information, which makes it difficult to generalize to other populations. However, the authors conclude that frequency of menopausal symptoms among female endurance athletes is high and severity of menopausal symptoms is similar to that reported in the general population. Despite high physical activity levels in this population, healthcare providers should address these symptoms to promote continued participation in physical activity, they say.

The authors add: ""We hope this work brings attention to a growing, yet understudied population that is eager for guidance in how to navigate the menopausal transition while continuing to participate in sport and exercise.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Washington's homeless hide in plain sight, growing sicker and costing taxpayers more","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251218/Washingtone28099s-homeless-hide-in-plain-sight-growing-sicker-and-costing-taxpayers-more.aspx","Thu, 18 Dec 2025 10:45:00 GMT","

Every night, Abdullah Ibrahim retreats from the streets into a wooded stretch along the Potomac River.

As night falls and temperatures drop, he erects a tent and builds a fire beneath a canopy of pine, hemlock, and cedar trees.

He evades authorities by rotating use of three tents of different colors at three campsites. As day breaks, he dismantles his shelter, rolls up his belongings, and hides them for the next night. ""They don't see you if you're in the woods,"" the 32-year-old said. ""But make sure it's broken down by morning or they'll find you.""

During the day, he wanders, stopping at a public library to warm up or a soup kitchen to eat. What's important is to not draw attention to himself for being homeless.

""Police want us out of the way,"" he said, dressed in a gray jacket and carrying none of his possessions. ""Out of sight, out of mind.""

Ibrahim has been deliberate about blending in since August, when President Donald Trump placed the district's police under federal control and ordered National Guard soldiers to patrol its streets. The president also ordered homeless people to leave immediately. ""There will be no 'MR. NICE GUY,'"" he posted.

The Trump administration says encampment sweeps have reduced the visibility of homelessness, thereby enhancing the city. ""There is no disputing that Washington, DC is a safer, cleaner, and more beautiful city thanks to President Trump's historic actions to restore the nation's capital,"" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said.

While there may appear to be fewer homeless people in the nation's capital now, they have not disappeared.

In interviews, homeless people said they are in a constant shuffle, hiding in plain sight. During the day, they stay on the move, grabbing meals at soup kitchens and resting on occasion in public libraries, on park benches, or at bus stops. At night, many unsheltered people bed down in business doorways, on park sidewalks, and on church stoops. Some ride the bus all night, while a few shelter in emergency rooms. Others find respite in the woods or flee to suburbs in Virginia or Maryland.

There are about 5,100 homeless people in Washington, D.C., including in temporary shelters, according to an early-2025 homelessness tally. After Trump ordered the crackdown on public homelessness, people living in makeshift communities scattered and are now living in the shadows. City officials estimated in August that nearly 700 homeless people were living outdoors without tents or other shelter.

As winter draws near, they are exposed to the elements and grow sicker as chronic ailments such as diabetes and heart disease go untreated. Street medicine providers say that, since the National Guard was deployed, they have faced enormous difficulty finding patients. Many caught up in sweeps have had their lifesaving medications thrown away, and they are more likely to miss medical appointments because they are constantly on the move. Street medicine providers say they can't find their patients to deliver medication or transport them to medical appointments. The constant chaos can suck patients with mental illness and substance use deeper into drug and alcohol addiction, raising the risk of overdose.

Caseworkers report similar disruptions, saying as clients get lost, they break connections essential for obtaining housing documents, particularly IDs and Social Security cards.

District officials and health providers say this cascade will make homelessness worse, threatening public health and public safety and racking up enormous costs for the health care system.

""It was already hard locating people, but the federal presence just made it worse,"" said Tobie Smith, a street medicine doctor and the executive director of Street Health D.C.

Chris Jones was born and raised in Washington, D.C., but now is homeless, having been pushed out of his tent near the White House in the initial days of the federal homelessness crackdown. He said two of his tents were taken during sweeps. Now, sleeping on a sidewalk outside a church, he doesn't bother trying to get another one. ""Why? What's the point? It'll just get thrown away again.""

Jones, 57, has a severe knee injury that prevents him from walking some days and said he was scheduled for a knee replacement in December. He said it's important to stay where he is — he relies on a nearby drugstore to refill his medications for bipolar disorder, diabetes, and high blood pressure. When he's hungry, he goes to a soup kitchen for a meal or tries to get a cheeseburger and a soda from a fast-food joint across the street.

It's important for him to stay outside the church, he said, so his case manager can find him when a permanent housing slot opens up. If it gets too cold, he said, he will cross the street and sleep in the doorway of a business, which can provide a bit more shelter. He wants to get indoors, but for now, he waits.

Since taking control of Washington's police force, the Trump administration has ratcheted up pressure on cities and counties across the nation to clear homeless encampments under threat of arrest, citation, or detention. It has ordered or threatened similar National Guard deployments in Los Angeles; Portland, Oregon; and other cities with large homeless populations.

Rogers, the White House spokesperson, said the president is maintaining National Guard and federal law enforcement presence in the nation's capital ""to ensure the long-term success of the federal operation."" Since March, city and federal officials have removed more than 130 homeless encampments, she said, though some local homelessness experts say that number could be inflated.

The Supreme Court last year made it easier for elected officials and law enforcement to fine or arrest homeless people for living outside. Then, in July of this year, the president issued an executive order calling for a nationwide crackdown on urban camping, including a massive removal of people living outdoors and forced mental health or substance use treatment.

Trump is also spearheading an overhaul of homelessness policy, moving to slash funding for permanent housing and services for homeless people. The move would limit the use of a long-standing federal policy known as ""Housing First"" that offers housing without mandating mental health or addiction treatment. The National Alliance to End Homelessness warns the move risks displacing at least 170,000 people in permanent supportive housing. The Department of Housing and Urban Development paused the plan on Dec. 8 to make revisions, which it ""intends"" to do, federal housing officials said.

City officials say they are complying with the Trump administration's forceful campaign against homeless people sheltering outside. Pressured by the White House, local officials said they've gotten more aggressive in breaking up camps. Advocates for homeless people say some of the sweeps have been conducted at night and others with little or no notice to move. City leaders believe they could be done more compassionately by offering services and shelter.

""We've pivoted from the notion of allowing encampments if they didn't violate public health or safety to a position of, 'We don't want you in the streets,'"" said Wayne Turnage, deputy mayor for District of Columbia Health and Human Services, who oversees encampment cleanups. ""It's unsafe, it's unhealthy, and it's dangerous."" Yet he acknowledges the encampment sweeps can waste city resources as caseworkers and street medicine providers scramble to find their clients and patients.

Advocates say the Trump administration is inciting fear and mistrust between homeless people and those working to help them while wasting taxpayer dollars used to provide care and place people into housing. There are, however, far fewer tents and large-scale encampments visible to tourists and residents.

“People found safety in those communities and service providers could find them. Now there are people with guns and flashing lights dislocating folks experiencing homelessness without notice and just throwing stuff away,"" said Jesse Rabinowitz, campaign and communications director for the National Homelessness Law Center.

District officials say some people have accepted emergency shelter. But even as the city works to connect people with services and expand shelter capacity, officials acknowledge there isn't enough permanent housing or temporary beds for everyone.

And there will be fewer places for people living outside to go.

The city, in its fiscal year 2026 budget, concentrated its homelessness funding on families, funding 336 new permanent supportive housing vouchers. Yet it cut funding for temporary housing for both families and individuals and provided no new permanent supportive housing vouchers for individuals. That means fewer housing slots for single adults, who make up most of those wandering the streets. City officials said, however, that they have slotted 260 more permanent housing units for homeless individuals or families into their construction pipeline.

The fallout is inundating local soup kitchens with demand, including Miriam's Kitchen in Foggy Bottom. The local institution provides hot meals, housing assistance, and warm blankets to people in need.

Caseworkers say it's becoming increasingly difficult to help clients secure IDs and other documents needed for housing and other social services.

""I'm looking everywhere, but I can't find people,"" said Cyria Knight, a caseworker at Miriam's Kitchen. ""Most of my clients went to Virginia.""

It's unclear how much of the district's homeless population has fanned out to neighboring Virginia and Maryland communities. There were an estimated 9,700 homeless people in the region in January, months before Trump's crackdown. Four of six counties around Washington saw homelessness rise from 2024, while it fell 9% in the district.

""I'm not seeing my patients for a month or more, and then when I do, their chronic conditions are uncontrolled. They've been in and out of the ER, and they're more likely to be hospitalized,"" said Anna Graham, a street medicine nurse practitioner for Unity Health Care, a network of clinics in Washington. ""It's just setting us back.""

Graham's team stations its mobile medical van outside Miriam's Kitchen at dinnertime to better find patients.

Willie Taylor, 63, was figuring out where to sleep for the night after grabbing dinner from Miriam's. He saw Graham to receive his medications for advanced lung disease, seizures, chronic pain, and other health disorders.

He has difficulty walking and needs a wheelchair, which is complicated because he doesn't have a permanent address. Taylor and his medical providers say his previous wheelchairs have been stolen while he slept outdoors at night. He uses a shopping cart to keep him steady, walking around all day, until nightfall.

On a cold November night, Graham helped Taylor figure out his daily medications and checked his vitals. The team handed him a warm coat and hand warmers before sending him back outside.

After walking for about 45 minutes, he found a piece of park pavement where he could build a bed out of tarps and sleeping bags.

""My body can't take this,"" Taylor said, preparing to sleep. ""There's ice on the concrete. I'm in so much pain; it hurts so much worse when it's cold.""

Homeless people die younger and cost the health care system more than housed people, largely because conditions go untreated on the streets, and when they do seek care, many go to the ER. Among Medicaid enrollees, homeless people have been estimated to incur $18,764 a year in spending, compared with $7,561 for other enrollees.

Over at the So Others Might Eat soup kitchen earlier that day, Tyree Kelley was finishing his breakfast of a sausage sandwich and hard-boiled eggs. He was considering going into a shelter. The streets were becoming too dangerous for someone like him, he said, referring to the police and National Guard presence. He was feeling the loss of an encampment community that would watch his back.

He's been to the ER at least seven times this year to get care for a broken ankle he sustained falling off an electric scooter. The accident caused him to lose his job and health insurance as a garbageman, he said. His situation has caused him to sink deeper into a depression that began three years ago after his mother died, he said.

Then his father and sister died this year. He began to numb his pain with beer.

""You get so depressed, being out here,"" said Kelley, 42. ""It gets addictive. You start to not care about even changing your clothes.""

His depression also led him to seek out marijuana. Then he smoked a joint laced with fentanyl. The overdose sent him to the hospital for days.

""I actually died and came back,"" he said, crediting other homeless people with administering naloxone and saving his life. ""I need to get out of this, but I feel so stuck.""

A few blocks west of the White House sits a vacant plot of land that earlier this year held more than a dozen tents. Workers in the area sense what they don't always see.

""I was here when this was all cleared. A bulldozer came in, and all their stuff was thrown in a garbage truck,"" said Ray Szemborski, who works across the street from the now-empty lot. ""People are still homeless. I still see them around underneath the bridge. Sometimes they're at bus stops, sometimes just walking around. Their tents are gone but they're still here.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Social living allows genetic effects to spread through the gut microbiome","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251218/Social-living-allows-genetic-effects-to-spread-through-the-gut-microbiome.aspx","Thu, 18 Dec 2025 13:53:00 GMT","

Your ""roommate's"" genes could be influencing the bacteria living in your gut, and vice versa, according to a study of rats published today in Nature Communications. 

The research, carried out by studying more than four thousand animals, reveals that the composition of the rat gut microbiome is shaped not only by an individual's own genes but also by the genes of the individuals they share a living space with. 

The discovery reveals a new way genes and social life intertwine: through the exchange of commensal gut microbes that move between individuals. Though genes don't jump between individuals, microbes can. The study found some genes favour certain gut bacteria and these can spread through close social contact. 

""This is not magic, but rather the result of genetic influences spilling over to others through social contact. Genes shape the gut microbiome and we found that it is not just our own genes that matter,"" explains Dr. Amelie Baud, researcher at the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona and senior author of the study. 

The gut microbiome is the collection of trillions of microorganisms which live in the digestive tract, where they play key roles in digestion and overall health. While diet and medication are known to be among the main factors influencing these microbial ecosystems, the contribution of genetics has been more difficult to ascertain. 

In humans, only two genes have been reliably linked to gut bacteria. The lactase gene determines whether adults can digest milk and influences milk-digesting microbes. The ABO blood group gene also has an effect through yet-to-be discovered mechanisms. 

More gene microbe links could exist but are yet to be confirmed because nature and nurture are tricky to separate in the real world. For example, genes can influence diet and lifestyle choices, which in turn affect the gut microbiome. But families and friends share food, homes and microbes, blurring the line between nature vs. nurture's contribution to the gut microbiome. 

Instead, researchers at the Centre for Genomic Regulation and the University of California San Diego turned to rats. The animals share many features of mammalian biology, but can be raised in controlled conditions, such as giving everyone the same diet. 

All animals were genetically unique and coming from one of four different cohorts, each housed in a different facility in the United States and with different care routines, allowing the researchers to test which genetic effects held up across different environments. 

By combining genetic and microbiome data from all 4,000 rats, the team identified three genetic regions that consistently influenced gut bacteria despite differences in rearing conditions across the four cohorts. 

The strongest link was between the gene St6galnac1, which adds sugar molecules to the gut's mucus, and the abundance of Paraprevotella, a bacterium the researchers believe feeds off these sugars. It was found in all four cohorts. 

A second region contained several mucin genes, which make up the gut's protective mucous layer and were linked to bacteria from the Firmicutes group. The third region included the Pip gene encoding an anti-bacterial molecule, and was linked to bacteria in the Muribaculaceae family, common in rodents and also found in humans. 

The large size of the cohort allowed researchers, for the first time, to estimate how much of each rat's microbiome was explained by its own genes and how much by the genes of the other rats it lives with. 

Classic examples of this phenomenon, also known as indirect genetic effects, are when a mother's genes shape her offspring's growth or immune system through the environment she provides. 

The controlled conditions of the rat study allowed researchers to study these effects in a completely new way. The authors of the study built a computational model to separate genetic effects on a rat's own microbes from the effects of its social partners. 

They found that the abundance of some Muribaculaceae were shaped by both direct and indirect genetic influence, meaning that some genetic effects spread socially through microbial exchange. 

Once these social, or indirect, effects were included in a statistical model, the total genetic influence increased by four to eight times for the three new gene-microbe links discovered. The researchers say this may represent only a fraction of the true picture. 

""We've probably only uncovered the tip of the iceberg,"" says Dr. Baud. ""These are the bacteria where the signal is strongest, but many more microbes could be affected once we have better microbiome profiling methods."" 

By demonstrating that genetic influences can be coupled with gut microbe transmission, the authors of the study paint a new mechanism of action whereby the genetic effects of one individual can ripple through entire social groups, altering the biology of others without changing their DNA. 

If similar effects occur in humans, and given increasing evidence that the gut microbiome plays an important role in health, it could mean that genetic influences on human health have been underestimated in large studies. Genes may shape not only an individual's disease risk, but also the disease risk of others. 

According to Dr. Baud, the microbiome has been linked to everything from immunity and metabolism to behaviour, but not all the reported correlations reflect causal effects and the exact mechanisms of action remain elusive. Genetic studies like hers, which use animal models in controlled environments, can help move from correlations to testable causal hypotheses, helping explain how genes and the gut microbiome interact in human health. 

For example, the researchers note that the gene they discovered in rats, St6galnac1, is functionally related to the human gene ST6GAL1 which, in other studies, has also been linked to Paraprevotella. It suggests the way animals coat their gut mucous with sugars can determine which microbes are able to thrive in the digestive system, and that this could be a shared biological mechanism across species. 

The authors of the study also hypothesise how this possible mechanism could, in turn, influence infectious diseases like COVID-19. 

ST6GAL1 has been previously linked in other studies to breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections, cases where people catch COVID despite vaccination. It has also been demonstrated that Paraprevotella induces the degradation of the digestive enzymes that are used by the virus to enter the host's cells, so the researchers hypothesise that genetic variants in ST6GAL1 could influence Paraprevotella abundance and, in turn, viral infection. 

They also hypothesise why some people develop an autoimmune kidney disease called IgA nephropathy. Paraprevotella could alter IgA, an antibody that protects the gut but that, when altered, can leak into the bloodstream and form clumps that damage the kidneys, the hallmark of IgA nephropathy. 

The researchers now plan to investigate in detail how St6galnac1 influences Paraprevotella in rats, and what biological chain reactions this triggers in the gut and the whole body. 

""I am obsessed with this bacterium now. Our results are supported by data from four independent facilities, which means we can do follow up studies in any new setting. They're also remarkably strong compared with most host–microbiome links. It's a unique opportunity,"" concludes Dr. Baud.

The genome differs from person to person in thousands of positions. In some cases, this means that proteins have a different building block in certain regions, rendering some antibody-based therapies ineffective, report researchers from the University of Basel, Switzerland.

Antibody-based therapies are used to treat numerous diseases, from cancer to rheumatic disorders and multiple sclerosis. Antibodies recognize and bind to very specific structures. This allows them to direct active substances to exactly the right target structure in the body, for example.

Researchers from the University of Basel's Departments of Biomedicine and Biozentrum now report in Science Translational Medicine that individual genetic differences can prevent antibody-based therapies from being effective in some people.

The research team led by Dr. Rosalba Lepore and Professor Lukas Jeker used computer-assisted methods to analyze the genetic sequences of thousands of people from previously published studies. The DNA sequence contained in the genome determines the sequence of amino acid building blocks in proteins. This means that genetic variations can also lead to an altered amino acid sequence. The researchers focused on amino acids at the docking sites of established antibody therapies. Experts call the docking sites of antibodies epitopes.

A single changed amino acid in the epitope may mean that the antibody can no longer dock on it. The team investigated the binding sites of a total of 87 therapeutic antibodies whose uses include cancer therapies and the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

The team came across an astonishingly large number of naturally occurring variations in the amino acid sequence in epitopes.

These variants do not contribute to the disease themselves. The majority of them do not even impair the function of the protein in question, but they can render the treatment ineffective."" 

Dr. Rosalba Lepore, University of Basel

Using computer modeling, the researchers predicted which variants might interfere with antibody binding. Then they tested these predictions on four medically important target proteins and their corresponding therapeutic antibodies. For each of the analyzed proteins, several therapeutic antibodies were assessed. Laboratory experiments showed that often while one antibody could no longer bind, another antibody against the same protein but binding to a different region could still bind successfully.

In fact, the proportion of patients in whom such a variant occurs and hinders the effectiveness of the treatment is relatively small. For the majority of variants, less than one person in a hundred is affected. Nevertheless, Jeker is convinced that ""it is important for doctors to consider this aspect if a treatment is not working.""

In addition, many antibody-based therapies, including, for example, CAR T-cells, which are used against certain cancers, are very expensive. ""A genetic test to determine whether the treatment can actually work would be a small cost in comparison,"" says co-first author Dr. Romina Marone. This would also be relevant for new therapies, adds Rosalba Lepore: ""For clinical studies, testing the binding site of the antibody therapy in the study participants first could be worthwhile.""

Another finding from the analyses is that certain variants in target proteins are in fact very rare in Europe, for example. However, in another region of the world, they may occur more frequently and thus become clinically relevant.

""There is still much less genetic sequence data available for some regions of the world than there is for Europe or North America,"" explains bioinformatician Rosalba Lepore. ""As a result, we may be missing clusters of such treatment-relevant variants in certain population groups."" There is a lot of catching up to do in this regard, she notes.

Our mission was to humanize an antibody to enter clinical trials as a prophylactic and therapeutic treatment against CCFHV1.

We aimed to produce 1 mg of GP38 antigen at > 95 % purity for five strains of the virus.

Initial trials showed very low yield, purity, and poor QC results.

Optimized methods now yield 8-15 mg/L at 100 % purity for all required strains.

Increased NaCl and imidazole concentrations in affinity buffers prevented non-specific binding of host cell proteins to the column. Tris-based buffer for SEC prevented the reversible buffer-specific oligomerization previously seen in PBS.

When examining recovery during the first year after an ischemic stroke, a new study has found for daily tasks such as eating, dressing and driving, female participants experienced slightly worse recovery than male participants. The study was published December 17, 2025, in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. Ischemic stroke, the most common type of stroke, is when blood flow is blocked to part of the brain.

Stroke is a leading cause of disability in the U.S. and with the aging population, the number of stroke survivors is growing. Since many people live with physical, cognitive and emotional challenges after stroke, it is important to find ways to improve recovery. Our study provides a better understanding of sex differences during stroke recovery.""

Chen Chen, PhD, study author, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor

For the study, researchers identified 1,046 people who experienced their first ischemic stroke. Participants had an average age of 66. Researchers reviewed medical records and participant interviews to track their recovery at three, six and 12 months after stroke. Participants were given neurological assessments, cognitive tests and completed questionnaires about their quality of life.

Participants were also assessed on how well they completed daily tasks, both simple and more complex, such as walking, bathing, cooking and doing housework. A score of two indicated some difficulty completing daily tasks. A score of three indicated a lot of difficulty.

For daily tasks, female participants had higher average scores than male participants indicating poorer recovery at three, six and 12 months after stroke. For example, female participants had an average score of 2.39 and male participants had an average score of 2.04 at three months.

Scores for female participants, but not male participants, decreased from three to 12 months, indicating some improvement.

After adjusting for factors such as age, race and ethnicity, education and insurance status, researchers found female participants' average scores were higher by 0.13, 0.10 and 0.09 at three, six and 12 months, indicating poorer recovery than male participants. Chen noted the effect size was small.

While there were no sex differences in other areas of recovery, both sexes experienced improvement in neurological function, which includes communicating and performing simple movements.

""Our results suggest that early and repeated assessments of a person's ability to do daily tasks after stroke are needed, and particularly for female individuals, in order to reduce these differences in recovery,"" said Chen. ""When developing new interventions, these recovery patterns should be considered. Since the differences were mainly in activities such as doing heavy housework, shopping and carrying heavy weights, new interventions could include muscle-strengthening activities.""

A limitation of the study was that researchers did not have data on participants' use of rehabilitation services, so they were unable to evaluate the potential impact.

The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health.

Researchers have developed an electronic nose that can reliably sense and identify mold, which causes various health issues for humans and animals, as well as damage to homes and other buildings and structures.

As reported in a study published in Advanced Sensor Research, the e-nose uses nanowires that detect gas concentrations by measuring changes in electrical resistance resulting from gas molecules interacting with a sensing material. Experiments revealed that the e-nose can detect and identify two common indoor mold species, Stachybotrys chartarum and Chaetomium globosum, each separately grown on different substrates.

""Our results prove that the e-nose can not only detect but also identify the different mold genera, and thus make a significant step towards fast, objective, and cost-effective indoor air quality monitoring,"" the authors wrote.

The UPS is necessary for biological degradation of damaged, misfolded, or unnecessary proteins; E1, E2, and E3 enzymes sequentially catalyse transfer of Ubiquitin (Ub) onto the lysine residues of substrates (fig. 1).

TPD exploits the UPS to degrade disease-specific proteins. PROTACs (fig. 2) are heterobifunctional small molecules that hijack E3 ligases by forcing them into proximity with a protein of interest (POI), for its subsequent degradation via the proteasome (fig. 1). Currently exploited E3s are CRBN and VHL, largely confined to treatment of adult tumors.

Mechanical ventilation saves lives, but the airflow it produces inside an intubated airway can also shape conditions linked to complications during long-term support. In a recent study, SUNY Polytechnic Institute faculty Dr. Aarthi Sekaran (Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering) and Dr. Ahmed Abdelaal (Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering Technology) examined how two practical factors-endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff design and ventilator mode-change airflow behavior inside the human trachea.

Their paper, Computational and Experimental Characterization of Flow in an Intubated Human Trachea, recently published in a special issue of MDPI's Fluids on respiratory flows, focuses on the region near the ETT cuff, where secondary issues such as infection can originate. The team compared two cuff geometries commonly used in clinical devices, Taperguard-style and Microcuff-type, and evaluated them under two ventilation strategies: Pressure-Controlled Ventilation (PCV) and Assisted Volume-Controlled Ventilation (VCV).

To capture realistic, time-varying flow physics, Sekaran and Abdelaal combined 3D unsteady computational fluid dynamics (URANS CFD) with experimental validation, using flow measurements and visualization to confirm key behaviors. This blended approach allowed them to quantify changes in flow asymmetry, secondary flow structures, and wall shear stress, metrics that matter because they influence how strongly air ""drags"" along airway surfaces and how transport occurs near the cuff.

A central finding is that ventilator mode and cuff geometry interact: the Taperguard configuration under PCV produced substantially higher wall shear stress, reaching nearly double what was observed for the same cuff under VCV. In contrast, the Microcuff + VCV combination produced lower velocities and reduced shear, with peak levels around 80 percent of those seen in the Taperguard case.

Overall, the study provides a validated, engineering-based lens for understanding how device design and ventilation strategy can meaningfully reshape tracheal airflow, insights that can inform both future ETT design and clinical decision-making.

Genetic alterations lie at the heart of cancer development, but scientists may have been overlooking a powerful driver of these changes—the everyday nutrients that feed our cells.

Video Credit: Weill Cornell Medicine

""Most efforts have focused on known carcinogens—like tobacco smoke or radiation,"" said Dr. John Blenis, the Anna-Maria and Stephen Kellen Professor in Cancer Research in pharmacology at Weill Cornell Medicine. ""But metabolism has been largely unexplored in this context.""

Recently, his lab discovered that low levels of folate, a B vitamin essential for cell growth, can trigger specific genetic changes found in several human cancers, including lung tumors.

""Researchers have known about these genetic changes for many years, but no one knew what caused them,"" said Dr. Guillermo Burgos-Barragan, instructor in pharmacology at Weill Cornell, who is co-leading this project. ""Our data suggests that folate deficiency is a major contributor to lung cancer development and progression.""

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States, accounting for about 20 percent of all cancer deaths. For decades, scientists have known that smoking is the biggest risk factor for lung cancer. Yet, a mystery remains: why do some who have never touched a cigarette develop the disease while some lifelong smokers never do? Drs. Blenis and Burgos-Barragan may have uncovered part of the answer.

They found that mice fed a folate-deficient diet developed more aggressive, faster-spreading lung tumors and had lower survival rates than those on a normal diet. This provides evidence that dietary folate is a potent modulator of lung cancer progression, affecting both metastasis and survival.

""This is more than just a correlation. We have defined a novel mechanism that outlines how genetic changes occur on a molecular level,"" said Dr. Blenis, who is also a member of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell. ""Understanding this underlying biology may lead to identification of new drugs and biomarkers for certain cancers.""  

More broadly, they established a link between nutrition and specific genetic alterations in cancer, opening new dietary approaches for prevention and treatment. In the future, this may help people at risk of folate imbalance due to diet, genetics, medication or local nutrient deficiencies that arise within tumors. This research, however, is still in the early stages and will require further testing before it can benefit people.

Their work has the potential to change how scientists understand not only lung cancer, but also other cancers that may be linked to metabolism. ""This is only the beginning,"" Dr. Burgos-Barragan said. ""We are exploring how folate and other nutrients might cause or prevent genetic changes across different cancer types. Ultimately, we hope to find ways of preventing the initiation of cancer or halting its progression.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Eating high-fat cheese and cream may be linked to lower dementia risk","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251217/Eating-high-fat-cheese-and-cream-may-be-linked-to-lower-dementia-risk.aspx","Thu, 18 Dec 2025 02:13:00 GMT","

Eating more high-fat cheese and high-fat cream may be linked to a lower risk of developing dementia, according to a new study published on December 17, 2025, in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. This study does not prove that eating high-fat cheese and high-fat cream lowers the risk of dementia, it only shows an association.

High-fat cheeses contain more than 20% fat and include varieties such as cheddar, Brie and Gouda. High-fat creams typically contain 30-40% fat and include whipping cream, double cream and clotted cream. These are commonly labeled as ""full-fat"" or ""regular"" versions in stores.

For decades, the debate over high-fat versus low-fat diets has shaped health advice, sometimes even categorizing cheese as an unhealthy food to limit. Our study found that some high-fat dairy products may actually lower the risk of dementia, challenging some long-held assumptions about fat and brain health.""

Emily Sonestedt, PhD, Lund University, Sweden

Researchers analyzed data from 27,670 people in Sweden with an average age of 58 at the start of the study. They were followed for an average of 25 years. During the study, 3,208 people developed dementia.

Participants kept track of what they ate for a week and answered questions about how often they ate certain foods during the past few years. They also talked with researchers about how they prepared their food.

Researchers compared people who ate 50 grams or more of high-fat cheese daily to people who ate less than 15 grams daily. For example, 50 grams of cheese is about two slices of cheddar or half a cup of shredded cheese and is approximately 1.8 ounces. A typical serving of cheese is one ounce. Of those who ate more high-fat cheese, 10% developed dementia by the end of the study. Of those who ate less, 13% developed dementia.

After adjusting for age, sex, education and overall diet quality, researchers found that people who ate more high-fat cheese had a 13% lower risk of developing dementia compared to those who ate less. When looking at specific types of dementia, they found people who ate more high-fat cheese had a 29% lower risk of vascular dementia.

Researchers also found a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease among those who ate more high-fat cheese, but only among those not carrying the APOE e4 gene variant-a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.

Researchers also compared people who consumed 20 grams or more of high-fat cream daily to people who consumed none. For example, 20 grams of high-fat cream is about 1.4 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream. A recommended serving is about 1-2 tablespoons.

After similar adjustments, researchers found that those who consumed high-fat cream daily had a 16% lower risk of dementia compared to those who consumed none.

No associations were found between dementia risk and eating low-fat cheese, low-fat cream, high- or low-fat milk, butter or fermented milk, which includes yogurt, kefir and buttermilk.

""These findings suggest that when it comes to brain health not all dairy is equal,"" said Sonestedt. ""While eating more high-fat cheese and cream was linked to a reduced risk of dementia, other dairy products and low-fat alternatives did not show the same effect. More research is needed to confirm our study results and further explore whether consuming certain high-fat dairy truly offers some level of protection for the brain.""

A limitation was that study participants were all from Sweden, so results may not be the same for other populations. Sonestedt noted that in Sweden, cheese is often eaten uncooked, while in the United States, cheese is often heated or eaten with meat. Therefore, she says it is important that studies also be conducted in the United States. 

The study was supported by Swedish Research Council, Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation, Crafoord Foundation, Magnus Bergvall Foundation and Albert Påhlsson Foundation.

Alveolar macrophages are immune cells that live in the tiny air sacs of the lungs. Under normal conditions, these cells act as guardians, keeping the lungs healthy, supporting breathing, and preventing unnecessary immune responses.

However, new work led by Prof. Bart Lambrecht and Prof. Martin Guilliams (both VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research) shows that during allergic reactions, these macrophages can undergo a dramatic change. Instead of calming the immune system, they switch into an inflammatory mode that actively fuels allergy-driven lung inflammation.

Alveolar macrophages have long been seen as peacekeepers in the lung. Our results show that during allergic responses, they can do the opposite and actually help drive inflammation.""

Stijn Verwaerde, VIB

Using an advanced mouse model that allowed the researchers to precisely track and manipulate these lung cells, the team discovered that allergen exposure causes alveolar macrophages to send out signals that attract other immune cells into the lung. This influx amplifies inflammation and worsens allergic reactions. Remarkably, the macrophages were also found to fuse together into large 'giant cells' that change the structure of the lung tissue during allergy.

These findings challenge the long-standing view that alveolar macrophages are stable cells that resist change. Instead, the study reveals that they are surprisingly flexible and can be reprogrammed by their environment, sometimes with harmful consequences.

The discovery has important implications for understanding allergic lung diseases such as asthma. Current treatments mainly target other immune cells or inflammatory molecules. By identifying alveolar macrophages as active drivers of allergic inflammation, the study opens new avenues for research into therapies that could prevent or reverse their harmful switch, potentially reducing inflammation while preserving essential lung function.

Together, the results offer a new perspective on how allergic reactions escalate in the lung and highlight the complex, double-edged role of immune cells that are essential for health—but, under the wrong conditions, can contribute to disease.

U.S. Soccer has announced the details of two upcoming lotteries for World Cup tickets.

FIFA allocates eight percent of tickets for each match to participating member associations (PMA), and U.S. Soccer will distribute its allotment through two weighted draws.

""Quantities will vary by stadium, and demand is expected to significantly exceed supply,"" the federation said.

The two draws are exclusively for members of U.S. Soccer's Insider program, which is available in eight different tiers.

Of U.S. Soccer's allotted tickets, 10 percent will be available in a draw for Standard Insider members, who do not pay a fee.

The federation is conducting a second draw that will include 90 percent of its tickets. This lottery is for Insider members who pay an annual fee, which ranges from $45 per year for a Premium Insider all the way to $2,500 per year for the Keepers Circle.

The highest Insider tier, the Coaches Circle, costs $5,000 per year and includes guaranteed access to World Cup tickets.

The number of lottery entries each person receives is based both on the tier of their Insider status as well as the number of years they have been a member. The higher the tier and the more years one has been an Insider, the better odds they will have.

""For fans whose long-term commitment enables U.S. Soccer to remain in service to the game, we've designed a draw that recognizes and rewards that support,"" the federation said.

Lottery winners will have the ability to buy up to two tickets for all U.S. men's national team World Cup matches.

Eligible Insiders will receive access codes to apply for tickets in early January, with applications remaining open until Jan. 13.

The price for the tickets is not yet known. Under heavy criticism, FIFA announced this week that it would be offering a small subset of fans access to $60 tickets for all 104 matches.

Each PMA will determine which fans will have access to the $60 tickets, but FIFA's allocation meant that just roughly 1,000 of the lower-cost tickets will be available per match.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Will another injury derail Adams' World Cup prep for the U.S.?","https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/47335912/will-another-injury-derail-tyler-adamsworld-cup-prep-usmnt","Thu, 18 Dec 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

The U.S. men's national team will face numerous challenges in the run-up to the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The club situations of potential players will be looked at with a microscope in terms of who is playing and who isn't, but perhaps the biggest challenge of all will be just staying healthy.

The sad reality is that injury will strike a subset of players and prevent them from taking part in the biggest soccer party on the planet. In 2022, it was Chris Richards and Miles Robinson who missed out. In 2014, it was Stuart Holden who didn't make the plane to Brazil, while Jozy Altidore was sidelined with a hamstring strain just minutes into the tournament.

So it goes for the USMNT this cycle, with the team's hospital wing busier than manager Mauricio Pochettino would prefer. At least in some cases, a few players have made it back onto the field, but sadly, there is an exception.

Throughout the season, ESPN will be monitoring the progress of the player pool, delivering insights into those whose form or fitness has made them particularly intriguing. We call it the USMNT's countdown to the 2026 World Cup.

ESPN will count down to June 11 every week. When the U.S. team is announced for this highly anticipated World Cup on home soil, no names on that 26-man roster will come as a surprise. Only 176 days to go.

2025-26 minutes: 1,219
2025-26 FotMob rating: 6.9

Adams has endured his share of injuries over the course of his club career. A hamstring problem sidelined him for much of the 2023-24 season, while a back ailment following the 2024 Copa América limited his playing time as well. So it was with much relief that Adams showed some durability this season, playing in 14 of Bournemouth's first 15 league matches. That is until Monday's encounter against Manchester United, when Adams was substituted with not even five minutes on the clock due to a knee injury following a foot-to-foot challenge with United's Matheus Cunha.

The early diagnosis for Adams is a sprained left MCL, although it's unclear how much time he'll miss.

""It's bad news for us, because Tyler is massive for us,"" Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola said.

The injury comes at a time when Adams was near peak form, having just won the Premier League's Goal of the Month for his 47-yard dart against Sunderland. The hope is that Adams will recover in time to take part in the March international window.

2025-26 minutes: 331
2025-26 FotMob rating: 6.9

The Adams news is countered by the return to the field of Robinson, who made his first start of the Premier League season in the Cottagers' 3-2 win over Burnley, and even contributed a secondary assist on Calvin Bassey's goal. But what warmed the heart the most was that Robinson went the distance in Fulham's win. He then followed that up with another 90-minute appearance -- and a primary assist -- in Fulham's 2-1 defeat to Newcastle United in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday.

The defender's recovery from knee surgery last May has been stop-start. He missed the start of the Premier League season but then made a handful of appearances in September. He suffered a setback soon thereafter, and even as he joined his international teammates for the October window, discomfort in his knee was such that he was unable to get on the field.

Robinson's absence has given players like Max Arfsten and John Tolkin a chance to stake their claim for the World Cup, but it's clear that Robinson's experience and ability on both sides of the ball mean he's a cut above the competition. The USMNT is better off with his return.

2025-26 minutes: 868
2025-26 FotMob rating: 7.1

Pepi has endured some injuries of his own this season, in particular a muscle injury in his upper leg at the end of September that has made it difficult for him to unseat Guus Til for the starting striker spot with PSV. But Pepi is hitting peak form of late, scoring four goals in his past five matches -- four of those starts. An even bigger help is that manager Peter Bosz has moved Til back into midfield the past few games, allowing both players to get on the field at the same time.

The change has helped Pepi make the kind of run he needs if he's to make some headway at both club and international level. The path to a starting spot with the U.S. looks to be a bit more challenging, as AS Monaco forward Folarin Balogun is maintaining his grip on the position, but Pepi's goals mean he'll remain in Pochettino's reckoning.

Adams' injury means a slight change in this week's in-form XI.

With Middlesbrough's Aidan Morris also dealing with an ankle injury in recent weeks, Weston McKennie gets moved back to the center of midfield alongside Tanner Tessmann. McKennie's placement speaks to his versatility. For Juventus, he has played as a wingback, a center midfielder and even as an attacking midfielder for a spell. He has played the latter two positions for the USMNT. When the next international window arrives in March, it will be interesting to see where McKennie is deployed.

Having McKennie slide in beside Tessmann creates a spot for Malik Tillman, who has adapted well to new surroundings at Bayer Leverkusen. At the start of the campaign, it looked like he was boarding a sinking ship, with manager Xabi Alonso and a passel of star players all leaving. When Alonso's replacement, Erik ten Hag, was fired early on, those fears appeared to be confirmed. There was also the challenge of Tillman making the jump from the Eredivisie to the Bundesliga, but the U.S. international has successfully navigated that switch to be a solid contributor and has earned the trust of new manager Kasper Hjulmand. Impressive stuff so far.

Also impressive, but flying a bit under the radar, has been the development of Patrick Agyemang with Derby County. Agyemang is another player who has been tasked with making the jump to a more competitive league, going from MLS to the English Championship, but he has handled the move with aplomb.

His two goals in a 3-0 defeat of Sheffield Wednesday earlier this week gave him eight goal contributions in 1,221 minutes this season, second highest on the team, as Derby are now within four points of the playoff places. Another plus for Agyemang is that he has been playing on the left wing after having been used almost entirely as a central striker with the USMNT. It's a move that makes sense given that it allows the attacker to square up to goal more often.

Agyemang still has some players to climb over in order to secure a World Cup roster spot -- Balogun, Pepi and Haji Wright appear to make up the center forward pecking order -- but his form of late is keeping him in the running.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

MANCHESTER, England (AP) — The winner of the 2026 World Cup will receive $50 million from a $655 million prize pool, FIFA said Wednesday in announcing record financial rewards for teams in a tournament with ticket prices that have sparked outcries.

The champion's figure is up from $42 million won by Argentina in 2022 and $38 million gained by France in 2018 but less than half of what Chelsea earned for winning the much less-hyped Club World Cup this year.

The total prize fund for the World Cup, staged in the United States, Canada and Mexico from June 11 to July 19, is up 48.9% from the $440 million for the 2022 tournament in Qatar.

The 2026 total will be nearly six times the $110 million in prize money for the 2023 Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. FIFA president Gianni Infantino in 2023 set a target of equal prize money for men and women at their next World Cups — the next women's tournament is scheduled for 2027 in Brazil.

The Club World Cup, controversially expanded from seven teams to 32 and shoehorned into the soccer calendar last summer, had a total prize fund of $1 billion. Chelsea won the top prize of up to $125 million for a tournament that faced fierce resistance from players and leagues and drew sparse crowds for some matches.

FIFA has a different distribution model for the national team and club tournaments, with the disparity in prize money reflecting factors such as clubs with higher wage costs than national teams.

Beyond prize money, further funds are put toward development of soccer globally.

Infantino said the World Cup will be “groundbreaking in terms of its financial contribution to the global football community.”

In Europe, the Champions League also has a much bigger top prize than the European Championship for national teams. The maximum winnings for last year's Euros were 28.5 million euros ($33.5 million). Real Madrid picked up around $154 million for winning the Champions League in the same year. Both competitions are run by European soccer's governing body UEFA.

FIFA approved the prize money for the World Cup at a meeting of its council in Doha. In March it projected revenue for its current four-year cycle through 2026 at $13 billion, up from $7.5 billion for 2019-22.

Each of the 48 national federations at the expanded 2026 World Cup will receive $1.5 million for preparation costs and $9 million for participating in the group stage, the same as for the 2022 tournament. 

Teams advancing to the new round of 32 get $11 million and those reaching the round of 16 receive $15 million. Nations reaching the quarterfinals are paid $19 million, the fourth-place team $27 million, the third-place team $29 million and the final loser $33 million.

Including participation fees, FIFA will distribute $727 million to the 48 federations.

Each federation decides what to pay its players. The French sports daily L'Equipe reported France players were in line for a bonus of $586,000 by their federation if they won the trophy in 2022. France was ultimately beaten by Argentina in the final.

The U.S. Soccer Federation's 2022 collective bargaining agreements with the unions for its men's and women's national teams call for prize money for men in 2026 and women in 2027 to be pooled together, and 80% of the money to be distributed among the players.

Alex Lasry, CEO of the NYNJ Host Committee for next summer's World Cup, has “all the faith in the world” in his team's transportation plans that when fans arrive in the Big Apple, they will experience nothing but “safe, efficient, and seamless” commutes around the city and to MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

The home of the NFL's New York Giants and Jets is set to host eight matches for next year's tournament, including five group stage matches and the final on July 19. Earlier this month, soccer fans learned that MetLife Stadium would be the venue for traditional soccer heavyweights Brazil, France, Germany, and England to duke it out during the group stage. 

“[The draw] was so important, because this is when we learn the match times, so that allows us to take the next step in our planning,” Lasry, the former Milwaukee Bucks executive who served as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Travel and Tourism in the Biden Administration, told amNY. 

“This is going to be the biggest thing that this city in this region has ever hosted, and people are going to have a great experience, traveling to the game and traveling back from the game.”

However, during this summer's Club World Cup — a dress rehearsal for next year's showpiece event, a significant minority of fans experienced long train delays and system malfunctions. NJ Transit, which runs trains from New York Penn Station to Secaucus Junction and further onto East Meadowlands — MetLife Stadium's stop — moved around 153,000 people this summer. AmNY previously reported delays for the lesser-attended matches.

The stadium has also had trouble with past large-scale events, such as Super Bowl XLVIII and WrestleMania 2019, leaving fans at both events stranded on the East Meadowlands platform for hours. 

When the World Cup rolls around next summer, fans will most likely pack out the 82,500 seats in MetLife Stadium, especially when stars like Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe roll into town. That is almost 28,000 people more than the average attendance across the nine Club World Cup matches the stadium hosted this summer, and that figure is boosted by the 74,000 fans who attended the semifinals and the 81,118 who attended the final between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain. 

The public transportation system has pledged to increase its capacity to accommodate 12,000 people per hour for the tournament, while Lasry said they will be initiating a “massive messaging plan” for non-New Yorkers to navigate the public transportation system.

“Transportation is a key part, and it's why we were awarded the finals,” Lasry said. “We got the best public transportation system in the country.”

South American football once again ran into an old barrier. Flamengo's defeat to Paris Saint-Germain, on penalties, in the final of the FIFA Intercontinental Cup in Qatar, maintained Europe's dominance in club world competitions.

With PSG's title, Europe reached 38 trophies, combining the Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup, against South America's 26. The gap, now at 12 titles, reflects an inequality that grew stronger in the 21st century, especially after the tournament was consolidated under FIFA's format.

The 1–1 score in regular time and extra time took the decision to penalties, where the French side counted on a show from goalkeeper Safonov, who saved four shots. The defeat ended Flamengo's dream, as the club was chasing its second title and the end of Europe's dominance.

Flamengo's defeat marked the 13th consecutive loss by South American clubs in finals since 2013. The competitive performances were not enough to change the recent history of the competition.

The last time a South American club managed to put the world at its feet was in 2012. On that occasion, Corinthians, under Tite's command, delivered a true reality check to the powerful Chelsea (ENG) in Yokohama, Japan, winning 1–0 with a goal from the Peruvian Paolo Guerrero.

Since then, Europeans such as Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester City, and now PSG have dominated the tournament.

Beyond defeats in the finals, recent history shows that, in some editions, South American clubs did not even reach the Club World Cup final.

In 2010, Internacional were eliminated in the semifinal by TP Mazembe, from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Three years later, in 2013, Atlético-MG fell to Raja Casablanca, from Morocco, also in the semifinal. And in 2024, Botafogo were beaten by Pachuca, from Mexico, and missed out on the final.

These episodes reinforce that the South American struggle is not limited only to the direct clash against Europeans in the final.

The history of the matchup between the champions of South America and Europe, which officially began in 1960 with the Intercontinental Cup, was not always unbalanced.

In the early decades, the duel was fierce and, at times, favorable to the South Americans (Brazilians, Argentines, and Uruguayans), who had greater power to retain talent and a tradition of grit combined with a technical quality that held off the Europeans.

Clubs such as Pelé's Santos, Peñarol, Nacional, Independiente, Boca Juniors, and Flamengo (in 1981) matched or surpassed their rivals from the Old Continent. The home-field factor (matches were played home and away until 1979) and the South Americans' maximum motivation, as they saw the competition as the peak of the season, also played a role.

The scenario began to change drastically with increasing globalization and the implementation of the Bosman Law in Europe in 1995.

And, in this way, European football transformed into a money-making machine, centralizing resources and, consequently, the best players on the planet. The major Brazilian and Argentine clubs became factories of talent for foreign leagues, unable to keep their young players for long.



In the Intercontinental format, which ended in 2004, the record was more balanced. However, with FIFA's endorsement from the 2000s onward, and with the financial gulf widening, Europe's advantage became overwhelming.

PSG's title confirmed European favoritism, even though the decision came down to the details. For CONMEBOL, the scenario remains a structural challenge. As long as the financial difference persists, the world title for South American clubs will continue to be an exception, growing more distant with time.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Analysis: how prices for the cheapest World Cup tickets have rocketed","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/18/analysis-how-prices-for-the-cheapest-world-cup-tickets-have-rocketed","Thu, 18 Dec 2025 14:24:00 GMT","

A Guardian study of past ticket prices for the men's World Cup, compared with current 2026 figures, shows how the barrier for entry has been raised for most fans

In the past, a fan's ability to attend a World Cup hosted in their nation hinged more on bid books than their checkbooks. For 2026 in the US, Mexico and Canada, even the least expensive tickets are a luxury commodity by comparison.

An analysis by the Guardian of men's World Cup ticket pricing shows that amid the general rise in ticket prices for the 2026 World Cup, the most extreme of those hikes have often applied to the cheapest tickets. The analysis is based on official Fifa pricing dating back to 1994, with more robust data available starting in 2006. Prices for 2026 games are accurate as of 16 December 2025, and do not include the 1.6% of sellable tickets for each game that Fifa recently made available for a fixed $60 price.

It's important to note that Fifa's dynamic pricing model could see prices for any game fluctuate between now and the tournament. In some cases, they may drop precipitously, as they did just before some games at the 2025 Club World Cup. But for traveling fans – especially those from the four countries who may face visa restrictions – waiting until the last minute to get tickets may not be desirable or feasible.

For now, at the end of 2025 and with the first post-draw phase of ticket sales opening next year, the price rises are most dramatic in the lower categories, greatly raising the barrier for entry for the vast majority of interested fans. This is true across many rounds of the tournament, and especially so for the final.

Category 4 is historically the lowest price point for World Cups, and was previously exclusively available to residents of a hosting nation. The home-town discount was most prominent in 2018, with the lowest prices of the 21st century helping provide Russia with a historic home-field advantage as it reached its first quarter-final since 1970 (as the USSR).

In 2026, not only are the “cheap seats” at least three times pricier in most rounds than they were when Qatar hosted in 2022, there were so few Category 4 seats available that the whole tournament's inventory sold out before sales opened to the general public, per Fifa.

The most extreme of the price rises are concentrated where you think they might be: in the cities and for the games that carry the most importance, or those involving a host country.

Historically, most World Cup rounds have been priced more expensively than the ones before, with the exception of the third-place match being priced akin to a round-of-16 clash or a quarter-final. That's true again in 2026. Meanwhile, the nascent round of 32 born from an expanded field is priced similarly to group games.

The limited number of $60 seats at every game with prices capped still represents a five-fold increase over 2022's Category 4 group-stage entry point.

Dynamic pricing, introduced for this tournament, has been cited as the primary driver of these price increases. The practice allows prices for each game to change based on demand, and that demand has changed markedly since the World Cup draw. Before that point, every game had unknown participants except the nine involving host nations. Afterward, teams were assigned matchups and venues, so people for the first time knew who would be playing.

Here, the power of global stars becomes apparent. Compared with pre-draw ticket prices for each of their group games, Portugal saw the steepest price increases – which can be chalked up to the Cristiano Ronaldo factor. Lionel Messi's World Cup-holding Argentina come in second. Euro 2024 champion Spain and well-supported South American qualifiers Colombia and Uruguay round out the top five.

Notably, matches involving Iran were the only ones to see a double-digit percentage decrease.

The percentages listed below reflect the post-draw pricing compared with initial pricing for each match as specified by its date and venue.

In total, 91 of the 104 matches saw price increases after December's draw. Five matches saw their price points go unchanged; eight games saw decreases.

No matter what you end up paying, it's likely going to be a far cry from the pricing model promised during the bid process in 2018, held during Donald Trump's first term. This is from the bid book submitted to Fifa:

At the time, the United 2026 organizers strove to start group-game pricing for Category 4 at $21 – within a dollar of 2018's welcoming price when accounting for inflation. The recent $60 tickets released are still above the planned rates up until the quarter-final stage.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

MANCHESTER, England (AP) — The winner of the 2026 World Cup will receive $50 million from a $655 million prize pool, FIFA said Wednesday in announcing record financial rewards for teams in a tournament with ticket prices that have sparked outcries.

The champion's figure is up from $42 million won by Argentina in 2022 and $38 million gained by France in 2018 but less than half of what Chelsea earned for winning the much less-hyped Club World Cup this year.

The total prize fund for the World Cup, staged in the United States, Canada and Mexico from June 11 to July 19, is up 48.9% from the $440 million for the 2022 tournament in Qatar.

The 2026 total will be nearly six times the $110 million in prize money for the 2023 Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. FIFA president Gianni Infantino in 2023 set a target of equal prize money for men and women at their next World Cups — the next women's tournament is scheduled for 2027 in Brazil.

The Club World Cup, controversially expanded from seven teams to 32 and shoehorned into the soccer calendar last summer, had a total prize fund of $1 billion. Chelsea won the top prize of up to $125 million for a tournament that faced fierce resistance from players and leagues and drew sparse crowds for some matches.

FIFA has a different distribution model for the national team and club tournaments, with the disparity in prize money reflecting factors such as clubs with higher wage costs than national teams.

Beyond prize money, further funds are put toward development of soccer globally.

Infantino said the World Cup will be “groundbreaking in terms of its financial contribution to the global football community.”

In Europe, the Champions League also has a much bigger top prize than the European Championship for national teams. The maximum winnings for last year's Euros were 28.5 million euros ($33.5 million). Real Madrid picked up around $154 million for winning the Champions League in the same year. Both competitions are run by European soccer's governing body UEFA.

FIFA approved the prize money for the World Cup at a meeting of its council in Doha. In March it projected revenue for its current four-year cycle through 2026 at $13 billion, up from $7.5 billion for 2019-22.

Each of the 48 national federations at the expanded 2026 World Cup will receive $1.5 million for preparation costs and $9 million for participating in the group stage, the same as for the 2022 tournament. 

Teams advancing to the new round of 32 get $11 million and those reaching the round of 16 receive $15 million. Nations reaching the quarterfinals are paid $19 million, the fourth-place team $27 million, the third-place team $29 million and the final loser $33 million.

Including participation fees, FIFA will distribute $727 million to the 48 federations.

Each federation decides what to pay its players. The French sports daily L'Equipe reported France players were in line for a bonus of $586,000 by their federation if they won the trophy in 2022. France was ultimately beaten by Argentina in the final.

The U.S. Soccer Federation's 2022 collective bargaining agreements with the unions for its men's and women's national teams call for prize money for men in 2026 and women in 2027 to be pooled together, and 80% of the money to be distributed among the players.

Nigeria have taken their World Cup heartbreak off the pitch and into FIFA's disciplinary chambers, filing a formal protest alleging the Democratic Republic of Congo fielded ineligible players during their decisive African qualification playoff.

The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) confirmed it has petitioned FIFA over DR Congo's use of several dual-nationality players in last month's playoff final, which the Congolese side won on penalties to keep alive their hopes of reaching the 2026 World Cup in North America.




That defeat ended Nigeria's direct qualification route, sending DR Congo to the inter-confederation playoffs in March, where six teams will compete for the final two places at the expanded 48-team finals.









At the heart of Nigeria's complaint is an argument that goes beyond FIFA statutes and into domestic law.

The NFF contends that multiple DR Congo players were cleared by FIFA despite allegedly failing to meet Congolese nationality requirements, which, according to Nigerian officials, do not permit dual citizenship.

“The Congolese rules say you cannot have dual nationality,” NFF general secretary Mohammed Sanusi told reporters. “There are so many of them that have European passports – French, Dutch and others.

“FIFA regulations say once you have the passport of your country, you are eligible. As far as FIFA is concerned, they are eligible, and that is why they were cleared.




“But our contention is that FIFA was deceived into clearing them. It is not FIFA's responsibility to enforce Congolese law – FIFA relies on what is presented to it. We are saying what was presented was fraudulent.”

Nigeria's petition alleges that between six and nine players, many of them Europe-based and born or raised abroad, retained foreign passports despite representing DR Congo.

Under Congolese law, Nigeria argues, players must renounce other citizenships to hold full nationality, a step it claims was not taken.

Several of those players featured prominently in the playoff campaign, including the final, which ended 1-1 before DR Congo prevailed 4-3 in the penalty shootout.

The victory marked a historic moment for the Leopards, who have not appeared at a World Cup since 1974.

DR Congo's football federation, Fecofa, swiftly rejected the allegations, accusing Nigeria of attempting to overturn a result they failed to win on the field.

“If you cannot win on the pitch, then do not try to win from the back door,” Fecofa said in a social media statement. “The World Cup has to be played with dignity and confidence – not with lawyers' tricks. Bring it on.”

Fecofa insists all players were properly vetted and approved by FIFA in advance, stressing that FIFA regulations – not national citizenship laws – govern eligibility in international football.

The federation has indicated it submitted all required documentation and says it has nothing to fear from the review.

FIFA did not immediately comment on the case, which is now before its disciplinary bodies.

No timeline has been announced for a ruling, though similar eligibility cases have taken weeks or months to resolve.

The stakes are significant.

If FIFA were to uphold Nigeria's protest, potential outcomes range from fines or warnings to forfeited matches or even disqualification – though retroactive changes to knockout results are rare unless clear fraud is established.

Nigeria could theoretically be reinstated into the qualification pathway, but FIFA could also opt to order a replay or leave the results intact.

The dispute also highlights a long-running fault line in African football, where national citizenship laws sometimes clash with FIFA's global eligibility framework and the widespread use of diaspora players.

Several African teams, including DR Congo, Morocco and Senegal, have built competitive squads by drawing on players developed in Europe.","{'href': 'https://www.dailysabah.com', 'title': 'Daily Sabah'}","soccer"

Seeing the 2026 World Cup in person will be extremely expensive. Tickets for early matches currently range from about $140 to more than $2,700, while the cheapest seat for the final is priced at $4,185. The soccer fan network Football Supporters Europe (FSE) estimates that fans traveling from Europe will spend at least $6,900 to follow their team all the way to the final—nearly five times what it cost during the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Those prices are also a far cry from the $21 seats promised by organizers in Canada, Mexico and the U.S. in a 2018 bid document.

After facing backlash over these exorbitant prices, FIFA announced this week that it plans to cap a small portion of seats at $60, but those tickets will make up just 1.6 percent of the total. The move has done little to calm frustrated fans. It is “nothing more than an appeasement tactic,” FSE said in a post on X.

Still, it's better than nothing. “We take it as a win, but a largely symbolic one,” Ronan Evain, executive director of FSE, told Observer.

The $60 tickets will be distributed through the individual soccer associations of participating countries and will be available for all 104 matches of next summer's World Cup in Canada, Mexico and the U.S.—including the final. Those associations, which are allocated 8 percent of all World Cup tickets, will set aside 10 percent of that allotment for the new low-cost tier.

Each country will decide how to distribute the discounted seats to its most loyal fans. About half of the associations are expected to rely on existing loyalty systems, where supporters earn points for attending home and away matches and backing youth and women's teams, Evain said. Others may distribute tickets through supporter groups or a lottery.

FIFA, for its part, has defended its pricing by pointing to a variable strategy that adjusts costs “based on a review of demand and availability for each match.”  The governing body also said interest remains strong, noting that 20 million ticket requests have been submitted since the latest sales draw opened on Dec. 11.

Fans have also taken issue with the rising cost of accessible tickets for those with disabilities. World Cup tickets are typically divided into four price categories based on seat location. But so far, accessible seats have been restricted to categories one through three. That effectively locks fans with disabilities out of the most affordable tier—a reversal from previous tournaments, FSE said in a letter to FIFA on Dec. 16.

The group also criticized FIFA's decision to charge for companion tickets, noting that many fans with disabilities cannot attend matches alone. The most affordable options for a combined accessible ticket and companion ticket in the group stage are estimated to run between $280 and $900. In Qatar, by contrast, accessible tickets cost 10 euros (about $12) and included a free companion seat.

“This is clearly the sign of an organization that has lost its mind,” said Evain, who has yet to receive an official response from FIFA on accessible tickets. “I don't know if it's an oversight or if it's pure evil, but it shouldn't exist.”

Despite initial uproar at the huge inflation of prices, FIFA claims to have received five million ticket requests for the tournament.

The sales process for FIFA World Cup tickets officially began in September 2025, with the first allocation reserved for sponsors, Visa's official presale. This was followed in October by an early-entry ballot, before the larger random selection draw opened on 11 December, set to run through 13 January 2026. 

Following the release of prices, the initial reaction among fans has been overwhelmingly negative, as a tournament long seen as accessible to millions worldwide now appears increasingly restricted to those with the financial means to attend.

Supporting your national team at a World Cup is never inexpensive, with fans required to absorb high costs beyond tickets, including travel and accommodation. There was also anger directed at FIFA's pricing for the 2022 World Cup, when final-match ticket prices increased by 46% compared with the 2018 competition, and the number of affordable tickets declined. 

Given the outcry ahead of the 2022 tournament in Qatar, it is difficult to believe FIFA expected anything other than the negative reaction it has received in 2025. Seemingly seeking to capitalise on the highly commercial sports market of its North American hosts, the price increases are extraordinary.

2026 FIFA World Cup Ticket Prices

Source [2] BBC [3*] GlobalData Post Event Report (FIFA World Cup 2022)

Don't let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.

Fan discontent has prompted calls for action from several supporters' groups and national governing bodies. Football Supporters Europe (FSE) has labelled the pricing extortionate and has called on FIFA to immediately halt ticket sales, seeking greater engagement through consultation and a full review. 

A major factor behind the price increase relates to the expansion of the World Cup in 2026. The tournament has expanded from 32 to 48 teams, with FIFA promoting this change as an effort to broaden its market and increase opportunities for smaller football nations to qualify. 

This has occurred, with Cape Verde, Curaçao, Jordan, and Uzbekistan all qualifying for the 2026 competition for the first time in their history. While this expansion brings the tournament to more national fan bases, ticket pricing has not provided the same welcome. 

For example, Haiti has qualified for only its second World Cup (the first was in 1974), yet the cheapest tickets for its opening match against Scotland in 2026 are $180. Haiti is among the poorest nations in the world, with an average monthly wage of around $147, meaning a full month's income would not cover a single match ticket. 

This figure also excludes additional costs: long-haul flights from Haiti average $652, and, when combined with a base hotel cost of $120, the total reaches $952—equivalent to more than five months of the national average income.

Under Swiss law, FIFA is a non-profit organization, meaning its revenue from activities such as competition ticket sales is reinvested in the sport globally. Expanding the tournament to 48 teams guarantees greater ticket revenue, as the number of games will increase from 64 to 104. 

Based on an average Category 4 ticket price of $93 and an average stadium capacity of 63,134, this equates to an additional 2.53 million fans in stadiums, representing a potential $253.29 million in incremental ticket revenue from the extra matches alone. 

At the 2022 tournament in Qatar, FIFA reported $929 million in ticket and hospitality sales, a figure it is expected to surpass in 2026. This reflects a broader trend in soccer, in which hosts capitalise on fans' loyalty and desire to attend matches. In the Premier League, for example, 95% of clubs raised ticket prices for the 2024/25 season, and 65% did so again for the current 2025/26 season. 

Soccer is the most popular sport in the world, but this popularity is increasingly being exploited by those in charge. The FIFA World Cup is the pinnacle of the sport and, according to a recent GlobalData survey, the most popular sporting event that fans would pay to attend, with 27.8% of respondents expressing interest.

The reality for FIFA is that, despite high prices, fans are so eager to experience the World Cup that they are willing to pay a premium. The first 48 hours of ticket sales to the general public in December highlighted broad acceptance of the latest pricing, with five million ticket requests. 

Pricing also aligns more closely with the North American market in 2026. While domestic soccer is cheaper on average—for example, the average adult season ticket in the English Premier League equates to £32.53 ($44)—top US- and Canada-based sports leagues command significantly higher premiums. 

At the high end, in the final weeks leading up to the 2025 Super Bowl, average ticket prices on StubHub reached $8,076, comparable to the projected price for the 2026 World Cup final ($7,885). 

With high prices seemingly not fully derailing fan interest, it also supports FIFA president Gianni Infantino's personal agenda, delivering the highest revenue from a World Cup in history, and aiding his personal re-election campaign in 2027. 

The critical response and backlash to the ticket prices have since led FIFA to make a small concession, introducing a ‘small number' of more affordable tickets, priced at $60 (£45) for all 104 matches of the tournament. The reality is that this is a very small concession, which only on the face of it appears to show FIFA as having responded to unpopular opinion. 

The new, cheaper tickets will only be available within the ‘supporter entry' tier and cover 10% of this supporter allocation for each national soccer federation. The small concession does very little for fans or FIFA alike, as FIFA is still set to extract maximum value from the bulk of its tickets, and fans are still largely subjected to high costs.

Jack Grealish argued over a comparison between Everton ace Iliman Ndiaye and Bukayo Saka, and reckoned that his Merseyside teammate is more skilled than the Arsenal talisman. Speaking on a Stan Sport podcast, Grealish argued that while Saka remains among the most effective wide players in world football, pure skill belongs elsewhere in the Premier League.

Ndiaye's impact at Everton has been quietly significant. Since arriving from Marseille in 2024 for around £15 million ($20m), the Senegal international has grown into one of David Moyes' most reliable attacking outlets. This season, he has contributed four goals and two assists across 16 Premier League appearances, helping Everton climb into ninth place, and yet they remain within touching distance of the European positions due to a congested table. While his raw numbers do not yet rival Saka's, Ndiaye's influence is felt in subtler ways. His ability to glide past defenders, receive the ball under pressure and operate in smaller areas has transformed Everton's attack. Grealish highlighted exactly that quality, arguing that Ndiaye does not need space to hurt opponents, unlike many pace-driven wingers like Manchester City's Jeremy Doku.

Saka, still only 24, has delivered consistently for both club and country and remains central to Arsenal's title push. Yet Grealish drew a clear distinction between effectiveness and artistry, insisting that technical flair should be judged separately from output. In his view, Ndiaye represents the league's most skilful operator right now, capable of manipulating the ball in the tightest of spaces.

He said: ""Ndiaye is the most skilful player in the Premier League. In terms of pure skill, yeah. I'm not sitting here saying, oh yeah, he could be the best, but skilful. Saka, for example, is so good, one of the best wingers in the world. But he's not skilful.""

Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall agreed with the assessment and opined that Ndiaye is more skilled than Chelsea star Cole Palmer as well. He said: ""Yeah, but see, Cole... Cole's like... In terms of pure skill, like, you ain't gonna see Cole doing skills like anywhere, so I'm feeling that. Cole's just more silky and moving his body.""

Comparing with Doku, Grealish added: ""Like, Doku, for example, you wouldn't put him in, like, I don't know, a small five-a-side pitch. But Ndiaye wouldn't even need that space at all. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No matter where he's in. He's just in and out, whereas Doku, like, you know, might need a bit of space for his, like, pace and stuff. Saka as well.""

Ndiaye's form will inevitably attract attention, particularly with the World Cup on the horizon. Clubs across Europe are monitoring players of his profile, and he has been valued as high as £52.7m ($70.5m). Everton, however, are keen to project calm, insisting their focus remains on results rather than rumours. That calm was briefly disrupted after Chelsea's 2-0 win over Everton earlier in December, when Blues captain Reece James was spotted in an animated conversation with Ndiaye with his hands in front of his mouth to prevent the cameras from picking up his lip movements. Fans started speculating whether James was acting as an agent trying to convince Ndiaye to join Chelsea in January. It must be noted that Ndiaye had admitted to admiring Chelsea while he was developing his skills.

Speaking to BBC Sport in August 2024, he said: ""Personally, for me, it is the best league in the world. Everyone dreams of being in the Premier League. It is not easy to get to it. I know a lot of players whose aim was to play there, but it hasn't happened yet. I watch football, I live football, I eat football – when I was young, I used to be a fan of Chelsea. I watched Eden Hazard and Didier Drogba, and it was amazing watching them play.""

Ndiaye has flown to Morocco, where he will join his Senegalese teammates ahead of the AFCON. Meanwhile, Grealish will look to inspire the Toffees to a victory against Arsenal on Saturday at the Hill Dickinson Stadium. Saka might have something to say to his compatriot on the pitch after his recent comments, and what better than a nutmeg!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Alexander Isak transfer to Barcelona? Why Liverpool could look to sell £125m striker as Anfield future questions are also asked of £116m playmaker Florian Wirtz","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/alexander-isak-transfer-barcelona-why-liverpool-sell-125m-striker-future-questions-116m-florian-wirtz/blt3bb63fee88ab40e7","Thu, 18 Dec 2025 17:11:34 GMT","

It has been suggested, by Dietmar Hamann, that Liverpool could look to sell £125 million ($167m) striker Alexander Isak to Barcelona in the summer of 2026. Anfield future questions are also being asked of £116m ($155m) playmaker Florian Wirtz, while talk of Jurgen Klopp returning to Merseyside in a managerial capacity has been addressed by a former Reds star.

Liverpool smashed all kinds of recruitment records in 2025 when embarking on an elaborate spending spree. Having recaptured the Premier League title, Arne Slot was handed a historic warchest with which to work.

Germany international Wirtz briefly became the most expensive player in British football when moving to Anfield from Bayer Leverkusen, before that bar was raised again when Isak completed a protracted switch from Newcastle. Neither have offered much to the collective cause through the first half of the current campaign.

Asked about Isak's situation, with the 26-year-old netting just two goals through 15 appearances and struggling for full match sharpness throughout his time with the Reds, Hamann told JeffBet: “I'm not sure Liverpool will sell anyone in January, but if things don't pick up for Alexander Isak come March or April, they'll probably have discussions to sell him to a club like Barcelona in the summer. There will be plenty of takers for Isak because he's shown his ability at Newcastle. It also largely depends on the form of [Hugo] Ekitike, because if he continues to improve, it will be a struggle for Isak to get games unless he's forced out wide.”

Wirtz is still waiting on his first competitive goal for Liverpool, while registering only two assists, and the 22-year-old is another that could be written off as an expensive flop. Hamann added on his fellow countryman: “I think Liverpool will be okay financially, even without the Champions League, because they wouldn't have spent the money they did if they couldn't afford it. Liverpool haven't been big spenders before last summer and they tend to spend the money wisely. If Liverpool don't perform, then they won't be forced to sell. However, players like Alexander Isak or Florian Wirtz may have their futures looked at if they aren't performing and the club aren't in the Champions League.”

Liverpool have slipped to seventh in the Premier League table, leading to Slot facing surprising sack talk. It has been suggested that some familiar faces could be targeted if a change in the dugout is made.

On links to a legendary former club captain, Hamann said: “Steven Gerrard loves Liverpool, if he's asked to fill in as an interim manager, there is every chance he'd do it. We know how much he's loved by the fans. If the situation ever arose where Liverpool needs a manager for a few months, Stevie won't turn it down. I feel things are slowly coming together at Liverpool so I don't think it will happen, but I'm pretty sure he'd take the opportunity if it comes.

“It could absolutely boost his management career and there aren't many better places to get in the spotlight than Liverpool. It would be a fantastic opportunity for Gerrard to help manage his hometown club. I don't think he can turn it down.”

Hamann added on the reports claiming that Klopp - who stepped down as Reds boss in 2024 - could be lured back to Anfield: “I think Jurgen Klopp is happy at Red Bull. There have been changes at some of the clubs they own. But, I think it would be a wonderful story if Klopp returned to Liverpool. I can't even comprehend what the reaction would be if he stepped onto the training ground or back into Anfield if he were the manager again. I don't think Klopp managing Liverpool will happen again.”

Slot continues to call the shots for now, with Liverpool due to be back in action on Saturday when heading out on the road to Tottenham. That trip will be made without Mohamed Salah, with the Egyptian superstar - who returned to favour in a win over Brighton last time out following his explosive rant against the Reds - now on Africa Cup of Nations duty.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Tottenham Hotspur's pursuit of one of Brazil's brightest young forwards is facing a formidable obstacle, with Real Madrid reportedly preparing to muscle in on the race for Vasco da Gama sensation Rayan. The 19-year-old has emerged as one of South America's most coveted prospects this season, and interest from Europe's elite is now beginning to crystallise into concrete plans.

Spurs have been tracking Rayan closely for months, encouraged by his rapid development and consistent end product. Yet according to O Dia, the north London club may soon find themselves outflanked by Madrid, who are considering a bid in the region of €50 million (£44m/$59m) as they reassess their attacking options ahead of the next transfer window. Los Blancos view Rayan as a serious alternative following Endrick's impending loan move to Lyon. A potential €50m offer would significantly raise the stakes. That figure exceeds the €40m valuation first mentioned when Tottenham's interest became public, underlining how rapidly Rayan's stock has risen. 

Tottenham, for their part, have not rushed into formal negotiations. According toNT Vascaínos, assistant coach Matt Wells and scout Alex Fraser have conducted extensive analysis of Rayan's performances, including a close review of his recent outing against Fluminense. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with Tottenham impressed by his movement, composure in front of goal and tactical intelligence. Despite that admiration, Spurs are proceeding cautiously. Vasco da Gama remain firmly in control of the player's future and have little incentive to accelerate discussions. The Brazilian club recently tied Rayan down to a contract extension running until 2028, inserting a hefty €80m (£70m/$92m) release clause that effectively hands them leverage in any talks.

According to Sport, sporting director Deco has been following Rayan's rise carefully, with his recent form catching the eye once again. Deco's admiration for the player is longstanding; during his earlier scouting work for Barcelona, he had reportedly recommended Rayan when the forward was just 15. Despite those links, Rayan is understood to have no desire to move during the January window. His immediate focus remains on continuing his development at Vasco, where regular minutes and responsibility have accelerated his growth. A place in Carlo Ancelotti's Brazil squad for next summer's World Cup is said to be a major personal objective, after which a move to Europe would be reassessed.

Tottenham's confidence in the market has been bolstered by a significant financial boost. Earlier in the campaign, the club confirmed a £100m equity injection from majority shareholders, the Lewis family trust, strengthening Spurs' position as they plan for long-term success. Club executives see the investment as an opportunity to compete more aggressively for elite talent, particularly young players capable of shaping the team's future. Rayan fits that profile perfectly, and Spurs remain hopeful that their structured approach and clear pathway could appeal to the player when the time comes.

""We are pleased to announce that our majority shareholder, the Lewis family trust, has, through ENIC Sports & Development Holdings Ltd (“ENIC”), injected £100 million of new capital into the Club,"" a statement read on Tottenham's official website.

""This equity injection will further strengthen the Club's financial position and equip the Club's leadership team with additional resources to continue the focus on driving long-term sporting success. This additional capital is part of the Lewis family's ongoing commitment to the Club and its future.""

Whereas, non-executive chairman Peter Charrington said: ""As I stated a few weeks ago, our focus is on stability and empowering the management team to deliver on the Club's ambitions. I know the Lewis family are also ambitious for the future. Today's capital commitment reflects that ambition and I would like to thank them for their ongoing support. We will continue to do all we can to ensure that Vinai and his team are supported in the best way possible to take this Club forward.""

GOAL U.S. writers take a look at some of the biggest storylines in European soccer, including Mo Salah's future, Vinicius Jr's exit rumors, and the Premier League title race

The Christmas period is uncharacteristically quiet this year. This is supposed to be the bit where soccer takes off, where players get hurt, where titles are won or lost based on little more than fitness and vibes. Yet in the Premier League, at least, things look a little different. There are no Boxing Day games. The league hasn't shoehorned a title decider in December. You might even call it a little tame. 

Yet that doesn't mean that there's a lack of drama in Europe. Two weeks ago, Mohamed Salah gave an explosive seven-minute interview where he tried to force a transfer out of Liverpool. Arsenal are the best team in the Premier League, but are doing a pretty good job of failing to consistently prove it. Meanwhile, no one seems to want to win La Liga, with Barcelona and Real Madrid graciously allowing each other back into a title race with respective barren spells. The result? Rumors that Xabi Alonso could be sacked before Christmas.

And elsewhere, there's the Bundesliga, where Bayern are cruising. Harry Kane is enjoying the best season of his career. Luis Diaz is chipping in. But will that be enough to make some noise when the Champions League games start to matter? GOAL U.S. writers debate all of that and more in another edition of... The Rondo. 

Tom Hindle: Surely, at this point. Arne Slot put him in the squad for the Brighton game last week to avoid a PR nightmare and only brought him on due to injuries elsewhere. There will probably be a Saudi Pro League offer. It will probably be for a lot of money. Cash in, Liverpool. A fit and firing Salah makes them immensely better - that much is clear. But sometimes you've gotta let the money talk. 

Ryan Tolmich: Probably not, largely because it's in the best interest of everyone here to figure this out. For Liverpool, it's important to give Salah something of a fitting send-off, one that wouldn't burn any sort of bridge. It's also crucial to have him in the team, considering he's just six months removed from an all-time great Premier League season. For Salah, leaving Liverpool quietly and unceremoniously isn't befitting for a player with his legacy. Because of that, both sides should find a way to stick it out until summer before giving Salah a proper sendoff. 

TH: It really should be Arsenal, but Man City are starting to look scary aren't they? Manager Pep Guardiola has figured out his formula, and even without Rodri, they could still compete at a high level. They won't be the defensive juggernaut of a few years back, but there are goals throughout the team. Then again, Arsenal are the most complete team in Europe at the moment, and have ground out results week in, week out. It will be Arsenal, but it might be very, very close.

RT: If Arsenal don't do it this year, when will they do it? City are very good, but flawed. Liverpool have fallen apart. Chelsea have had growing pains, while Tottenham and Manchester United are nowhere near it. That leaves Arsenal by default, in reality, even if they are a great but probably not elite team. Again, this is a good a chance as any for them to change that perception and claim a long-awaited Premier League crown.

TH: Alonso is an excellent young coach who was handed an imbalanced squad. Still, that doesn't necessarily mean he was the right appointment. Alonso is a tactician and an ideologue. Madrid tend to need a vibes guy. The question is: is Alonso good enough of a coach so that the teething issues can be overlooked? Who knows. He always seems to be one loss away from the sack, which really isn't fair. In an ideal world, he gets three full years. In the world of Madrid, he could be out any week. Conclusion: he gets sacked in the summer. Football isn't fair. 

RT: Stop. When you hire a young coach, you understand that there will be certain growing pains, particularly early. If you weren't prepared for that, you shouldn't have hired a young coach. Alonso was a genius as a player and has already shown that he is a fantastic coach with the work he did at Bayer Leverkusen. Give him time, and let whatever players are causing him problems know that they have to fall in line. Either that, or acknowledge that this job is only possible for two or three coaches on the planet, which would say a lot about the state of your club if so.

TH: Yep, and they should make loads of money doing so. Madrid have made the mistake of owning three of the best five left wingers in the world, all of which have little apparent interest in playing anything but left wing. Vinicius and Kylian Mbappe have started to look a little better playing together. But they're still not on the same page, and are undoubtedly restricting each other and the club is still figuring out how to work in Rodrygo. If a big offer comes in: PSG, Saudi - wherever - Florentino Perez should at least consider it. 

RT: They could consider it, for sure. The attack is surely crowded and, if you were to pick one player to sell, you could say it's. Doing so would raise a bunch of funds that could be spent elsewhere while also freeing up space for Kylian Mbappe to play on the left. Could you take that huge fee and get a true No. 9 as well as some other key pieces? Probably. It's an idea worth considering, even if it is all dependent on what exactly the club thinks it can do with that money.

TH: Do we count the Eredivisie? Ok, that's a little harsh, but PSV are already running away with the Dutch top flight, and that duo really should find themselves with silverware at the end of the campaign. As for a big five league, why not Johnny Cardoso and the Copa del Rey? Atleti probably don't have what it takes to win La Liga. But a cup run is well within reach. 

RT: The easy answer would be the duo of Ricardo Pepi and Sergino Dest, as PSV continue to waltz through the Eredivisie. The fun answer would be Christian Pulisic, though, as he looks to lead Milan to a Scudetto. Currently one point behind rivals Inter, Milan will believe they can do it, particularly if Pulisic keeps playing at the level he has been. If he does that, the conversation around him will change dramatically, which would be wild in a World Cup year.

TH: Nah. Bayern are a really good team, but it's tricky to figure out exactly how good they are when they don't face the best competition every week in the Bundesliga. A group-stage loss to Arsenal can be explained away, but it does little to change the reality that PSG, Barcelona, and Manchester City feel more convincing Champions League bets than Bayern right now.

RT: They might be the favorites right now, yeah? There are plenty of contenders at the very top, and there will surely be twists and turns, but Bayern have shown one vital trait: an unwillingness to lose. They've shown the ability to fight back just as much as they've shown the ability to run away with games, and with Harry Kane doing Harry Kane things, they have the firepower to really give this a go.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

A generational showdown is officially on the calendar as Spain and Argentina prepare to contest the Finalissima in Qatar, setting up a first-ever senior meeting between Lamine Yamal and Lionel Messi. With the European and South American champions colliding at Lusail Stadium, the one-off clash promises symbolism, history and World Cup-level intensity just months before the 2026 tournament.

Spain and Argentina have confirmed plans to face each other in the Finalissima, with the intercontinental clash scheduled for March 27 at Lusail Stadium in Qatar. The fixture brings together the reigning European champions and the holders of the Copa America in a showcase match that has quickly become one of the most prestigious events on the international calendar outside the World Cup.

The match will mark the fourth edition of the Finalissima overall, though it is only the second time this century that the trophy has been contested. Argentina are the current holders, having defeated Italy 3-0 at Wembley in 2022, while earlier incarnations of the competition saw France beat Uruguay in 1985 and Argentina overcome Denmark on penalties in 1993.

Beyond the silverware, the confirmed meeting has captured global attention due to the individual narratives involved. The game will see Barcelona prodigy Yamal face Messi for the first time at senior international level, with the teenager likely to line up for Spain against the Argentine captain in a symbolic clash of football's present and future.

The Finalissima represents more than just a one-off trophy, acting as a flagship event in the ongoing partnership between UEFA and CONMEBOL. By pitting the champions of Europe against the champions of South America, the fixture is designed to celebrate continental excellence while offering fans a rare competitive crossover between the two dominant regions of the international game.

For Argentina, the setting adds a layer of emotional significance as Lusail Stadium is where Messi lifted the World Cup in 2022, ending a 36-year wait for La Albiceleste for football's most coveted prize. Spain, meanwhile, arrive as European champions and one of the favourites for the 2026 World Cup.

The spotlight will inevitably fall on the meeting between Yamal and Messi, a pairing that feels almost poetic given their shared connection to Barcelona. Both are left-footed right-wingers, both have worn the iconic No.10 shirt, and both emerged from La Masia as generational talents, albeit at very different stages of their careers.

At just 18, Yamal has already become a central figure for both club and country, playing a key role in Spain's European Championship success and regularly drawing comparisons to Messi. The teenager has repeatedly attempted to temper those narratives, insisting he wants to follow his own path rather than be framed as a successor to the Argentine legend.

Their relationship, however, stretches back far further than this confirmed meeting. Images of Messi posing with a baby Yamal during a charity calendar shoot in 2007 resurfaced during Euro 2024, while additional photos show the pair together at Barcelona's training ground when Yamal was still an academy player, and Messi was at the peak of his world-beating powers.

Attention will now turn to March 27, when Spain and Argentina meet in Qatar for a match that carries both sporting and symbolic weight. The Finalissima will be decided over 90 minutes, with penalties used if the score remains level, ensuring a definitive winner on the night at Lusail Stadium.

For both teams, the fixture also forms part of their broader preparation for the 2026 World Cup. Spain and Argentina are among the favourites for the expanded tournament, and the Finalissima offers a rare chance to test themselves against elite opposition outside their respective confederations.

“I love the way he uses every inch of the court. He is comfortable coming in, he defends incredibly well… I felt I was playing myself in a mirror.”

When praise like that comes from Novak Djokovic, it tends to linger. For Dino Prizmic, it arrived early and emphatically in a career still in its opening chapters.

At last year's Australian Open, the 20-year-old Croatian pushed Djokovic to four sets in their first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, earning the admiration of the former World No. 1. Eighteen months later, Luciano Darderi echoed those sentiments after beating Prizmic in the quarter-finals of the ATP 250 in Umag.

“I hope he's going to be Top 10 really soon,” Darderi said. “I think Croatia is in good hands.”

This week in Jeddah, where Prizmic is competing at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, those endorsements remain a source of motivation rather than pressure.

“It's a really good feeling, but I know that I need to work a lot, especially to be in the Top 10,” Prizmic told ATPTour.com in Jeddah. “I need to continue to play lots of tournaments at a very high level to get near those levels, but I will try.

“Is there a pressure? No, definitely more confidence. There is no pressure in that part.”

Prizmic first announced himself in 2023 by lifting the Roland Garros boys' singles trophy, fulfilling a personal goal to finish his junior career with a Grand Slam title. His breakout moment soon followed under the lights of Rod Laver Arena, where he stood toe-to-toe with Djokovic on one of the sport's grandest stages.

But momentum stalled in 2024. A series of injuries forced Prizmic off course, limiting his schedule and disrupting his rhythm. Rather than rush his return, the Croatian opted for patience, a decision that paid dividends this season.

“It was really a great year for me, especially at the end of the year. I played very well and had a very good run,” Prizmic said. “It's really a pleasure to be here in Jeddah and to be part of this tournament.

“I didn't play lots of tournaments because I was injured still a little. I played like 15, 16 tournaments. And I'm the most proud because I didn't play many tournaments, but when I played, I played very good.”



Back at full health, Prizmic rebuilt his confidence on the ATP Challenger Tour, capturing two titles in 2025. He also qualified for the US Open main draw and claimed three tour-level victories, tangible signs of progress as he continues his transition to the professional ranks.

“Players have more experience now, which is normal. But I think I am adjusting to the level,"" said Prizmic, who went 27-9 at that level this year. ""Playing the Challengers compared to juniors is different, but I think everyone can adapt.”

That adaptability will be tested again this week in Jeddah. After losing to Nishesh Basavareddy in his opening match, Prizmic faces a likely must-win encounter against Justin Engel on Thursday as he looks to keep his campaign alive.

Still just 20, the Croatian remains focused on steady growth rather than fast-forwarded expectations. The praise is there. The talent is evident. And while the road ahead may twist, the Croatian appears ready for each course correction.

Alexander Blockx delivered another emphatic statement on Thursday at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF in Jeddah, where clinched a semi-final berth on his tournament debut.

The 20-year-old Belgian showed spirit under pressure, prevailing in two clutch tie-breaks and racing through to subdue Nishesh Basavareddy 4-3(2), 4-3(8), 4-1 and extend his impressive run. Needing a straight-sets win to qualify for the semi-finals on Thursday, Blockx rose to the moment — saving three set points in a pivotal second-set tie-break before seizing control.

History: the first Belgian to reach the Final 4️⃣#NextGenATPFinals pic.twitter.com/cmB2G24fGE

“I knew about 20 minutes before the match, it appeared on the screen in the warmup room,” Blockx said when asked about needing a straight-sets win. “I'm very happy with winning that second set, I barely got through… I just got luck on my side and in the third set my energy went up.""

After firing 24 winners to add to the 30 he struck in his opening win over Justin Engel, the second-seeded Blockx is making his presence felt at the high-octane, innovative showcase in Jeddah. The 6'4” powerhouse has blended explosive groundstrokes with sharp court craft, even flashing defensive brilliance against Basavareddy en route to becoming the first Belgian to reach the final four in tournament history.

Earlier, Prizmic notched the first win of his debut campaign with an electric performance over spirited 18-year-old Justin Engel.

The third-seeded Prizmic earned a 4-1, 2-4, 4-3(3), 4-1 with an eye-catching blend of power and precision. Having fallen to Basavareddy in four sets on Wednesday, the 20-year-old Croatian is now 1-1 in the Red Group and will aim to secure qualification for the semi-finals when he faces Blockx, whom he beat in the Lugano Challenger earlier this season.

After a sluggish start to his debut campaign at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, Dino Prizmic is up and running thanks to an electric performance on Thursday afternoon.

The 20-year-old Croatian fended off a spirited Justin Engel 4-1, 2-4, 4-3(3), 4-1 with an eye-catching blend of power and precision. Having fallen to Nishesh Basavareddy in four sets on Wednesday, the third-seeded Prizmic is now 1-1 in the Red Group and will aim to secure qualification for the semi-finals when he faces fellow debutant Alexander Blockx on Friday.

“Of course [it was a must win] if I want to stay and fight for the semi-finals,” said Prizmic. “I'm very happy with my performance, I am getting better with every match. Today was a good match for me.

“The conditions are very fast, so I just tried to play better [than Wednesday] and to use fast footwork. From yesterday, I'm very happy about the performance and I think it will be even better tomorrow.”

As well as delivering a selection of squeaky-clean drop shots, Prizmic sent the fans into a frenzy with a blistering backhand winner on the run to earn the crucial break in the fourth set. He let out a mighty roar knowing that he still has plenty more to give in his Jeddah debut.







Both of Prizmic's 2025 ATP Challenger Tour titles have come on clay, his preferred surface, but on Thursday he showed just how effective his grit and elasticity can be on indoor hard courts.
Basvareddy, who is one of two returners (also Learner Tien), could qualify for the semi-finals if he defeats Blockx on Thursday.

The world No. 2 says that the Iga Swiatek Foundation is committed to building safe spaces where young people can pursue their passions and consciously build their future.ByTENNIS.comPublished Dec 18, 2025 copy_link

One of Poland's most recgonizable athletes, Iga Swiatek took a leap forward in shoring up the future of sport in her country by awarding five scholarships to young Polish talents through her eponymous charity foundation this week.Swiatek launched the Iga Swiatek Foundation this summer, and announced in September that it would be awarding grants of nearly half a million Polish zloty (about $140,000) to help up to five athletes ages 15 to 22 to ""pursue their passions and consciously build healthy, sustainable careers.""The scholarship winners were Ignacy Andrzejczak (under-20 champion in hurdling), Wiktor Chmurski (member of the Polish junior national swim team), Liwia Kubin (multiple medalist in junior and senior speed skating), Jan Pyla (member of Poland's junior national golf team) and Oliwia Sybicka (the top-ranked under-16 tennis player in Poland).

The group will receive funding for 12 months beginning in January, and also be supported by Swiatek's personal team of advisors: physiotherapist Maciej Ryszczuk, sports psychologist Daria Abramowicz, orthopedic doctor Mateusz Dawidziuk, partnership manager Alina Sikora, and public relations and communications manager Daria Sulgostowska.""I wanted to create a program that really helps talented athletes on their way,"" Swiatek said according to the WTA website, after meeting the winners at Warsaw's Hotel Verte. ""I wanted it to be not only financial support, but also access to knowledge and experts. I know from my own experience how important both of these elements are, both at the beginning of a career and throughout it.""

As she presented the scholarships to the winners this week, the six-time Grand Slam champion spoke about why she started her foundation, the goals of her scholarship program, and how the athletes were chosen. The winners also took part in panel discussions with Swiatek's team, focusing on ""the importance of taking a holistic approach to athletic development, how to effectively work with sponsors, and image building.""The 24-year-old's advisors know firsthand what it takes to build an athlete's brand, as evidenced by Swiatek's on- and off-court endorsement portfolio in 2025.

23 Most dramatic moments of 2025

Everything you need to know about the 2026 regulations

Dr Helmut Marko is set to leave Red Bull after spending two decades with the team, making one of his final acts Arvid Lindblad's promotion to Racing Bulls.

Arvid Lindblad, who will make his F1 debut in 2026 with Racing Bulls, has praised Red Bull's Motorsport Advisor Helmut Marko for supporting him through his junior career ahead of his departure from the team.

The Austrian played a crucial role in managing the Red Bull Junior Programme, overseeing the development of young drivers from Racing Bulls to the senior team, including World Champions like Max Verstappen and Sebastian Vettel.

With Isack Hadjar set to replace Yuki Tsunoda at the Milton Keynes outfit next season, the 18-year-old Lindblad will become the final driver to have been advised by Marko and promoted to a seat after finishing sixth in Formula 2 in 2025.

“It's quite a big thing,” the rookie said of his ties with Marko. “I mean, I've worked very closely with them the last couple years, Rocky [Guillaume Rocquelin, Head of the Red Bull Driver Academy] and Dr Marko and the whole team. I'm extremely grateful for their support and all the work we've done, but especially with Dr Marko.

“It's not been the easiest year for me. I'm not happy with how it's gone, but he believed in me when others didn't, and I'm very grateful for that.

“I find it funny when a lot of people say how difficult it can be to work with him, their stories of how they struggled to work with Dr Marko, how he's very difficult and people are scared of him. For me, it's always been the opposite. I've always had a very good relationship with him.

“There are certain things he wants to see, and I mean, I can't talk for others and their experience, but I've always had a very good relationship with him, and he's helped my career massively. The fact that he believed in me when others didn't, I'm very grateful towards him, because this opportunity wouldn't have come without him.

“I don't really like excuses and when people talk rubbish, and he doesn't do that – he just says the truth, and I like to do the same. I think on that side, it's helped me. It's helped me to learn the best way, helped me progress the fastest, because he just says the truth and the way things have been. And I appreciate that honesty as well, because there are a lot of people in motorsport who want you to tell them what they want to hear.”

As the sole rookie on next season's grid, Lindblad will have plenty to learn, but Red Bull have supported his quick progression through the junior formulas – and he outlined the additional help they have provided through offering Free Practice opportunities and the chance to drive previous iterations of their cars.

Most recently, he featured in the annual post-season test in Abu Dhabi, in which both regular drivers and rookies take part. He completed an impressive 139 laps and ended the day just 0.014s slower than his Racing Bulls team mate Liam Lawson.

Lindblad explained:  “I've been doing a lot on the sim with [Red Bull]. I have been for a while now, already started a bit last year, and then obviously, I've been doing some of the FP1s, a little bit of TPC [Testing of Previous Cars] running. So I've been doing a lot of work with Red Bull.

“I think that it isn't just F2 that has helped the decision [to choose me] for next year. I've been working closely with [Red Bull] for a long time. It's my fifth year on the programme, so I have a very close relationship with all of them.”

23 Most dramatic moments of 2025

Everything you need to know about the 2026 regulations

Like many professional athletes, Lance Stroll has faced criticism during his time in F1.

Lance Stroll has explained how he has refined his approach to shutting out criticism throughout his career by focusing on the advice of those who know him best.

The Canadian driver has featured on the Formula 1 grid since 2017, when he made his debut with Williams and claimed a maiden podium at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, where he lost out on P2 to Valtteri Bottas in a photo finish.

After two seasons, he moved to Racing Point – a team that had been taken over by his businessman father Lawrence Stroll, leading to accusations that his contract was partly the result of his familial relationship with the new owner.

He has also faced criticism for his performances compared to team mates, with Sergio Perez, Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso all outscoring Stroll throughout their seasons with Racing Point and the subsequently rebranded Aston Martin respectively.

Speaking on the Unearth Your Greatness series created by the Silverstone based team, Stroll said: “I like to see it as just noise. If I buy into it, it bothers me, for sure, but that's where I am fortunate I have good people around me that I love, that I trust, and I put my attention and value their opinions.

""I try and live in my world, not the world in that sense. There's always going to be criticism. People are very short-minded. You have a couple of good races, you're great. You have a couple of bad ones, you suck.

""That's never going to change. That's why being surrounded by important people and valuing the opinion of people that you care about, that you value. That you really know, their opinion is what matters. Don't take criticism from someone you wouldn't take advice from.”

Stroll has largely settled into the midfield with some strong performances, amassing three podiums and one pole position in his career so far, but he has recently struggled to maximise Aston Martin's pace after they chose to prioritise their 2026 challenger as he finished this season in P16 with 33 points.

While his father is still the team's Executive Chairman, there have been a host of changes in recent years, including new state-of-the-art facilities and legendary designer Adrian Newey stepping into the Team Principal role from next season.

There are hopes that they can return to fighting at the front of the pack, but the 27-year-old outlined how his rollercoaster career has helped him feel prepared for every eventuality, whether that's competing for podiums or trying to break into the points.

""We can talk about the podiums and the pole, but let's talk about the losses,” Stroll continued. “I think that's where you learn the most about yourself to grow from those tough moments. I think that's where you really grow as a person, as an athlete, as a driver, from those struggles.

""I want every day to be great and perfect, but that's just not the reality of sport. In sports, in anything in life that you pursue, there's going to be those highs and those lows.

“You have to accept that before you even go into it. Before every season, I think to myself, 'There's going to be good days and bad days and I have to accept that now.'

""We all love the champagne celebrations. But it's really in those hard moments, in those tough times, that we really learn the most about ourselves and we grow.""

23 Most dramatic moments of 2025

Everything you need to know about the 2026 regulations

F1.com sat down with one of Lando Norris' first teachers to reflect on how he went from a shy student to an F1 World Champion.

Lando Norris made his childhood dream a reality at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix when a hard-earned podium finish secured the 2025 F1 World Championship title. As well as the euphoria and relief felt by the McLaren driver, his family and his friends trackside, a quiet corner of Somerset, England – where Norris went to school – beamed with its own pride over the completion of a special journey…

Born in Bristol to British father Adam and Belgian mother Cisca on November 13, 1999, Norris spent his education at the nearby Millfield Prep School and Millfield School, where he carefully balanced studies with a developing karting career that took him across the UK and Europe through the 2000s and 2010s.

“Almost straight away he was coming back with trophies,” Dan Close, who taught Norris at the time and is now Millfield Prep School's Deputy Head of Operations, tells F1.com. “He was quite shy to begin with, and he didn't really want his trophies presented in assembly – maybe because they were taller than he was, thinking about these great big things in motor racing!

“Interestingly, one of Lando's Year 3 teachers wrote in one of his reports that if he didn't want to be presented for anything and wanted to remain anonymous, maybe he had a position as the ‘Stig' [on British motoring television show Top Gear]. That was when he was eight years old.

“Apart from that, he just got stuck into everything. He played some rugby, some hockey, some cricket, and he got involved in all the bits and pieces that go with school life.

“His family were very good as well, working with us in terms of him being away from school, and making sure he got all the work that he needed to catch up on, because obviously it's never a done deal that you're going to rise to the heights that he's risen to.

“His mum would often stay in Somerset while Lando and his dad were off doing their thing, and that's not easy, so I love the way that he was really thankful [after winning the title]. It's refreshing that it was also about other people, rather than all about himself, because he recognises that this is not something you can do alone.”

Indeed, what Close and his Millfield colleagues have taken plenty of satisfaction from is Norris never appearing to let the success – and fame that came with it – go to his head while he impressively worked his way through the motorsport ranks.

Norris went from karting World Champion in 2014 (a year before he left Millfield) to full-time McLaren F1 racer in 2019, via wins and titles in a host of single-seater championships, but Close sees the same person at the end of it all.

“I suppose what we're most proud of as a school is that Lando's remained authentic,” he adds. “It's one of our school values, to be authentic. He said he wanted to win the title his way, and we feel he has done that.

“He doesn't seem to have changed a bit, and again, I think a lot of that comes from his mum and dad. All four of their children have been through the school – his older brother and the two girls – and they've always kept them very grounded.

“The man we see on the F1 podium today has still got that sort of glint in his eye – and the cheeky smile – he had when he first joined us at school.

“He's just a good lad who never got arrogant about what he was doing. He always seemed to hide his light under a bushel, if anything, and didn't seek the limelight in that regard, but it's all paid off in the end.

“He's managed to live his dream, and that's how he came in at Millfield. His Year 3 teacher said, ‘When you're World Champion, I hope you remember who taught you!', and I'm sure that he's kept those values. We're just enormously proud of him.”

Due to the timing of the season finale and the latest school term ending, Millfield's community could not celebrate together when Norris crossed the line in Abu Dhabi and sealed the deal, but Close expects a suitable ceremony to be held in the New Year.

Not only will that landmark title be recognised, but also the trials and tribulations experienced along the way, as touched on by Close above and as spoken about by Norris at length in the past – from mental health struggles to the challenges that come with delivering under extreme pressure.

“As a community, we haven't really had a chance to reflect and celebrate, but I guarantee you that when we come back from the Christmas holiday, the first assembly of the year will centre on Lando and his achievements,” says Close.

“We'll talk about how he's had to be resilient and bounce back through the highs and lows, through the things that have gone right and the things that have gone wrong, along with the dedication and the perseverance, because it doesn't come without effort.

“I think that's the message that we'll pass on to the children. We've got a fine tradition at Millfield of producing some worldclass sporting people, as well as in other areas, but the one thing we often talk to the children about is coping with failure, understanding that you're going to learn from that, and that it's not the end of the world.

“If you're true to yourself, if you push on and you believe enough, that will help you part of the way, and then with a bit of talent and a few bits of luck, who knows?”

As for what else can be expected, Close adds with a smile: “I'm sure our catering department will have a ‘Lando lunch' as well, where they all wear orange or papaya, and maybe we'll serve the children with papaya fruit, because obviously that's the McLaren colour.

“And, just reflecting on it, the main pathway from our reception and dining block to the main school block is called the ‘M5', because that's where all the traffic is, and that's the big road in the southwest – but maybe we should change it to ‘Lando Way' or something.

“Clarks Village, which is the local shopping outlet, actually added a ‘Lando Lane', so they've stolen a march on that one! But we've got a big banner with Lando's name on it and everything he's achieved, and we're going to have to change the banner to ‘2025 World Champion', which is pretty exciting.”

With the dust settling on Norris' success, Close is already looking forward to watching his former student write the next chapter in his life and career, while continuing to inspire the next generations that pass through Millfield's doors.

“The children in the school just love to see one of ours having some success,” Close comments, admitting they would go “absolutely nuts” if Norris manages to pop back for a visit. “We had Rory Gibbs, a gold medallist at the Paris Olympics in rowing, return to the school last year, as well as James Guy, who was an Olympic champion swimmer.

“They see these people come through the school and they know that it is possible [to reach those heights], because only a few years ago, Lando was sitting on the floor in assembly in the same spot that they are now. I think that's the most inspiring thing.

“Ultimately, as an establishment, we are so proud of Lando and his family for everything they've managed to achieve, and we wish him every future success. It's going to be amazing to see the number one on his car next year. When you know somebody and you've had some investment in their life, you just want them to do well.

“I, for one, will be voting for him for BBC Sports Personality of the Year, and we'll be encouraging everybody else in the school to do the same. That's the next thing. It's strong competition, but that would be the cherry on the top…”

23 Most dramatic moments of 2025

Everything you need to know about the 2026 regulations

From team radio tears, to unforgettable scenes in parc ferme, becoming a Formula 1 World Champion undoubtedly produces some of the most emotional moments in sport. After Lando Norris became the latest driver to celebrate title glory, we look back at some of the greatest championship-winning celebrations in F1 history.

It takes absolutely everything within a Formula 1 driver to get over the line at the end of a gruelling season to win a World Championship. When they finally achieve their goal, the release of emotion is immense. Sometimes it's tears, sometimes it's a guttural scream, but it's always a raw and authentic reaction to dreams coming true. Lando Norris became the latest to experience a championship-winning triumph, clinching his first title thanks to a podium in the season finale at Abu Dhabi.

We've had plenty of iconic moments over the years, with even more iconic celebrations to match. With Michael Schumacher, Sebastian Vettel and many more to come, let's have a look at some of the best from F1 history.

Going into the final race in 2025, there were three drivers in contention for the Drivers' Championship – the McLaren pair of Oscar Piastri and Norris, along with Red Bull's Max Verstappen. The Dutchman almost pulled off a stunning comeback from over 100 points behind, but it was the Brit who took the title by a mere two points.

When Norris crossed the line, the magnitude of his achievement hit him hard. The 26-year-old fought through cries of laughter and tears to thank his team and family on the radio, before composing himself to give the crowd some donuts.

Hugs were shared with his competitors, his mum and dad, his brother and sisters, and his partner, before the customary champagne drenching on the podium. Celebrations went long into the night, including a rousing rendition of Neil Diamond's Sweet Caroline by our new champion.

The final of Vettel's historic four consecutive World Championships, 2013 was some of the German's finest work. He ended the season with nine wins in a row, wrapping up the title with three races to spare. Vettel and Red Bull were an unstoppable duo, winning 13 out of 19 races that year – the fifth-best win-to-race ratio of all time.

After storming to a 30-second victory, Vettel was feeling mischievous, ignoring direct instructions from his race engineer to go to the pit lane. Instead, he drove to the grid and performed some expert donuts for the crowd. Then, he produced one of the most legendary photos in F1 history, climbing out of the cockpit and bowing down to his RB9. The ultimate way to pay homage to one of the greatest cars ever designed.

While Hamilton's 2020 season was characterised by dominance in the technological marvel that was the W11 Mercedes, the Brit reminded everyone in Turkey that when tricky conditions are at play, there's no-one quite like Lewis Hamilton.

He won 11 out of 17 Grands Prix that year, only finishing off the podium three times in the Covid-affected season. The combination of Hamilton's absurd pace and the car's innovative dual-axis steering and aero concepts was unstoppable.

However, Turkey tested all the defending champion's skills; thanks to a fresh surfacing and rain, the track was an ice rink. Hamilton struggled to P7 in Qualifying but used all his experience to decide his own strategy and master the conditions, driving so long on intermediate tyres that they resembled slicks after the race. He won by a staggering 30 seconds, confirming his seventh Drivers' Championship and a fourth in a row.

After crossing the line, Hamilton remarked: “That's for all the kids out there who dream the impossible. You can do it too man! I believe in you guys!” An inspiring message from a driver who worked so hard to break barriers and achieve his goals. Standing on his car, having won what is currently his last title, an emotional Hamilton raised his arms in the air, producing one of the most recognisable F1 photos in modern times.

One of the great F1 seasons deserved one of the great F1 celebrations, and that's exactly what we got in the title decider at Yas Marina in 2021. Red Bull's Verstappen and Mercedes' Hamilton had been going blow for blow all year long, culminating in an Abu Dhabi showdown with both drivers tied on 369.5 points.

The Mercedes driver had taken the lead from the pole-sitting Dutchman early on, and looked in control until a late Safety Car with five laps to go.

Red Bull gambled with a pit stop, and following a controversial Safety Car procedure, Verstappen overtook Hamilton on the final lap of the season to win the first of his World Championships.

There was absolute pandemonium in the Red Bull garage, with Verstappen's race engineer Gianpiero Lambiase screaming the famous line “Oh my lord Max,” on team radio, which was quickly drowned out by Verstappen roaring at the other end of the line. Having spent some time lifted on the shoulders of his team, Verstappen walked onto the podium with the Dutch flag as he became the first Drivers' Champion from the Netherlands. An unforgettable race, and unforgettable celebration.

The turn of the century was a game-changing year for both Michael Schumacher and the Ferrari team. Although the German driver had already clinched his first and second World Championship half a decade earlier with Benetton, it was 2000 that sparked the beginning of a world-beating partnership where driver and team went on to win an incredible five championships in a row together.

The first iconic championship-winning celebration that year came in Suzuka for the penultimate race of the championship, when Schumacher secured his third World Drivers' Championship title, and ending Ferrari's 21-year Drivers' title drought in the process.

After four seasons of frustration and heartache, the elation was almost too much to bear for Schumacher, who slammed on the steering wheel so hard it broke! Shouts of ‘We did it!' down the radio, and a shoutout to his wife Corrina – the in-lap was incredibly wholesome, whilst his team were leaping around the garage hugging one another with jubilation and relief.

Schumacher leapt up onto the top step of the podium with such vigour that he almost slipped right off it, but in a moment that certainly brought a tear to every Ferrari fan's eye, Team Principal Jean Todt joined Schumacher on the podium and lifted him into the air. It wasn't long until the celebrations took a rogue turn, with Schumacher driving a forklift through the paddock – and leaving Japan with a hangover that took a few days to recover from...

The celebrations continued after the season finale in Malaysia as the team secured the Constructors' title for the second year in a row. Post-race, Schumacher donned an eye-catching red wig, which we can only imagine might have been some sort of bet with his team!

In one of the greatest season finale comebacks, a young Vettel came back from a 15-point deficit to win the 2010 Drivers' Championship with an epic victory in Abu Dhabi, and in doing so became the youngest World Champion ever.

Aside from the race, one of the most memorable moments came from his team radio after taking the chequered flag. After winning the race, Vettel had done all that he could – all he and the Red Bull team had left to do was wait. Between the young German driver and the title was two-time World Champion Fernando Alonso.

After it was confirmed that his title rival had finished down in seventh, so came the infamous radio message from his engineer, “I need to wait. But it's looking good! You just wait sunshine, you just wait...” And sure enough, the message he'd been waiting for came, “Du bist Weltmeister!”

Then came the wave of emotion, and the tears on team radio that lasted until way after the podium ceremony. It was a childhood dream come true as he became just the second-ever World Champion from Germany, and Vettel couldn't quite believe it.

A fresh-faced 24-year-old Alonso cemented himself as one of the best drivers of his generation in 2005, claiming his first World Championship for Renault at Interlagos. The Spaniard's unique driving style and fearless mentality was unbeatable that year, and he went into the Brazilian Grand Prix needing a podium to secure the crown with two races still to go.

Despite the rapid McLaren duo of Juan Pablo Montoya and Kimi Raikkonen finishing in first and second, Alonso coasted home in third, sparking wild celebrations in the paddock as Renault won their first Drivers' Championship as a constructor. Alonso couldn't contain his passion, and as he stood on his R25 in the pit lane, he released a guttural scream, before launching himself into his team. He achieved his dream, and boy was he going to celebrate.

The recently retired Button enjoyed his best season with the fledging Brawn GP team, born from the ashes of Honda from the year before. The team quickly realised they had nailed the car for the 2009 regulations, as they were a second quicker than the field in pre-season testing, thanks to their double diffuser. Winning six of the first seven races gave the Brit a big enough lead as the rest of the grid closed the gap in performance.

However, Button still needed a vintage performance to secure the title after a poor Qualifying left him down in P14 in Brazil. Under huge pressure, he carved his way through the field to finish fifth and win the Drivers' Championship in Brawn's only season. Button set the tone for an evening of partying by singing Queen's We Are the Champions on the radio on his in-lap – and it wasn't a bad rendition after a 71-lap race!

Rosberg had fought hard in 2014 and 2015 to get the better of his rival and childhood friend Hamilton, but to no avail. But in 2016, the German found a new level of dedication and commitment which allowed him to finally get his hands on the Championship trophy. He raced out the blocks to start the year, winning the first four rounds, before recovering from a difficult spell to consistently finish on the rostrum. Finishing on the podium 16 times from 21 races was enough to give Rosberg the edge over the Brit, thanks to a gutsy performance at Yas Marina.

Despite Hamilton backing Rosberg into the chasing Vettel and Verstappen, Rosberg held his nerve to take the chequered flag in second. The scenes were wild from Rosberg's side of the garage, and there was a sweet moment on the radio from his wife, Vivian Sibold, who congratulated Rosberg as he crossed the line.

Some championship donuts followed, but when he got his hands on the championship trophy at the end of season awards, Rosberg had one last shock up his sleeve. He duly announced his retirement, knowing just how much it had taken out of him to achieve his dream.

Villeneuve took to the speed and intensity of F1 with ease, taking pole position on debut in 1996, before narrowly missing out on the title to team mate Damon Hill. But in 1997, it was the Canadian's turn for success. His season with Williams was littered with wins and retirements – seven and five respectively – but a disqualification in the penultimate race gave Ferrari's Schumacher a one-point lead heading into the finale in Jerez.

The weekend couldn't have been more dramatic as Schumacher, Villeneuve and Heinz-Harald Frentzen all set the same time to the thousandth of a second in Qualifying, with Villeneuve starting first having the set the lap before the others.

Schumacher drove away at the start from the pole-sitter, but when Villeneuve attempted a move on Lap 48 for the lead, the Ferrari collided with the Williams, a move that both retired Schumacher from the race and earned him a disqualification from the Drivers' Championship. Villeneuve limped home over the line to take the title in his sophomore season at just 26 years old.

The son of Gilles Villeneuve was held aloft by McLaren's Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard on the podium, and he soaked in the moment on their shoulders in front of the Spanish crowd.

23 Most dramatic moments of 2025

Everything you need to know about the 2026 regulations

Ferrari made a team decision to dedicate more resources to their 2026 challenger at an early stage of the 2025 season.

Charles Leclerc has admitted that, despite enduring a frustrating year with Ferrari, the decision to switch focus to 2026 was a “no-brainer” as the team quickly realised they would not be able to get involved in the 2025 title battle.

The Scuderia suffered their worst result since 2020 as they settled for P4 in the Constructors' Championship, dropping behind McLaren, Mercedes and Red Bull and failing to win any Grands Prix.

Both Leclerc and Team Principal Fred Vasseur have explained that they became aware early on that they would not be able to fight on an equal standing with their rivals, so they chose to put more resources into next season, when the new regulations and car design are poised to shake up the competitive order.

This meant that while they could introduce mechanical upgrades throughout the year, they neglected aerodynamic development, forcing the Monegasque driver to extract as much as possible as their rivals continued to improve their cars.

Asked how significant the psychological burden was of knowing he would be at a technical disadvantage as the season progressed, Leclerc replied: “Well, not so much because we were at a technical disadvantage from the first race.

“So, it's not like it changed massively our approach to the season. And we saw it relatively quickly that we wouldn't be fighting for the world title because McLaren was too strong, Red Bull was obviously starting to make big gains, there wasn't much point in putting all our resources into trying to take the third or second place – if everything was going super well – in the Constructors', at the cost of next year, whichever cost it may be.

“So yeah, it's never something you want to do. I would have much preferred pushing the development the whole year to try and clinch that world title, 100%.

“But if you are in the position that we were in at the beginning of the year, I think it was kind of a no-brainer. So, I don't regret it.”

Despite the challenges, Leclerc delivered one pole position and seven podiums, leading to him taking P5 in the Drivers' Standings, albeit 77 points behind Mercedes' George Russell.

His team mate Lewis Hamilton had a similarly tough campaign with Ferrari as multiple Q1 exits frequently left him downbeat, while it was also his first season without a Grand Prix podium since he joined F1 back in 2007.

Prompted to elaborate on their troubles, Leclerc continued: “I think for us there's not only one reason. There are many reasons which, at different times, played a role. In the beginning of '22, we actually started off quite strongly, but we were struggling with porpoising, where Red Bull had a very stable platform.

“And they were actually quite a lot overweight, so as soon as they took off that weight, they were suddenly at the level where they've been since then. And then for last year, we focused very early on next year's car, which I hope is a bet that will be a winning one.

“But for sure, it has some influence from the last two thirds of the season where we've been struggling more than others because we didn't bring that many upgrades. But in general, it's just been a generation of car that was very, very difficult to understand.

“And what worked back at the factory – I think everybody has been surprised once or more times that when you bring it on track, it doesn't correlate exactly to what you were expecting from that part. And that was the challenge of it. And yeah, other teams did better, especially McLaren and Red Bull.”

The news division is also planning a town hall with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore in the 'Things That Matter' series, with Bank of America lined up as a sponsor.

CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss is looking to make her mark on the network news division, launching a series of primetime town halls and debates alongside Weiss' The Free Press under the banner “Things That Matter.”


	CBS says that Vice President JD Vance, Maryland Governor Wes Moore, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have all agreed to participate in the town halls, with the debates set to address topics like “Does America Need God?” “Has Feminism Failed Women?” and “Should Gen Z Believe in the American Dream?”




	CBS has lined up people like Isabel Brown and Harry Sisson to debate the American dream, Steven Pinker and Ross Douthat to debate the God question, and Liz Plank and Allie Beth Stuckey to debate the feminism question.

	“We believe that the vast majority of Americans crave honest conversation and civil, passionate debate,” said Weiss in a statement. “This series is for them. In a moment in which people believe that truth is whatever they are served on their social media feed, we can think of nothing more important than insisting that the only way to get to the truth is by speaking to one another.”

	The Things That Matter town halls and debates will kick off in 2026, though no specific dates have been set as of now. Bank of America has signed on to sponsor them. Moore and Vance will talk about the future of the Democratic and Republican parties, respectively, as well as what they see as the state of America.

	











	They follow a town hall that Weiss hosted with Erika Kirk earlier this month. It is not clear if Weiss will host the new series herself, as she did with the Kirk event, or if other talent will join her. The Kirk town hall averaged 1.9 million viewers on CBS.

One day before he turns 80, Criss will release a self-titled rock album, his first in 18 years. 


													By
												

	Gary Graff



	It's a proverbial December to remember for KISS' original drummer, Peter Criss.


	Consider that in a span of two weeks the drummer, singer and songwriter received a Kennedy Center Honor with the band (which will be televised Dec. 23 on CBS), is releasing his first new album in 18 years on Friday (Dec. 19) and, come Saturday (Dec. 20), celebrates his 80th birthday. It's all a “never in my wildest dreams” proposition, Criss says, and proof that the Catman isn't nearly out of lives yet.


	“I'm not tooting my horn, but I really worked hard for this,” Criss tells Billboard via phone from his home in New Jersey, where he recorded portions of the new Peter Criss album. “I started at 10 years old. I'm a musician and always a musician first. I'm about music, not about anything more than that. So I never expected all of this. I thought the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (induction, in 2014) was, ‘Holy mackerel…' This is just a blessing from God.”

	











	Criss, who was born George Peter John Criscoula and raised in Brooklyn, actually started work on Peter Criss during 2008, shortly after the release of his fifth solo album, One For All, in the summer of 2007 but shelved the recordings at the time. During the pandemic, however, guitarist and co-writer Mike McLaughlin phoned and said, according to Criss, “‘Cat, you should listen to that album we started. It's a good album.' I started listening and, ‘Yeah, this is a really good album. We've really got something here.'” That notion was also supported by his friend, current Mötley Crüe guitarist John 5, whom Criss considers “like my son.”


	“I was in California and played it for Johnny and he said, ‘Peter, this is a great album. You've got to finish it.' ‘You really love it, John?' ‘Are you serious? Yeah! I want to be on it!' So, ‘OK, I guess we're gonna do this.'”

	











	Criss and co-producer Barry Pointer wound up deconstructing the 2008 recordings, keeping the drum tracks Criss had laid down at the time but bringing in McLaughlin and bassist Billy Sheehan to record new parts and adding keyboards by longtime friend Paul Shaffer and backing vocals. John 5 plays on three of the 11 tracks, and Criss replaced all of his scratch vocals during the past couple of years. The album's package design was done by Matt Montgomery, aka Piggy D. of Marilyn Manson and Rob Zombie's bands, who also plays bass on the track “Cheaper to Keep Her.”


	“I put my heart and soul into it,” Criss says. “My voice, I'm still singing like a bird; boy am I lucky. I felt I was in control and I was enjoying myself; you can hear me laughing on the record. We all had a great time, and we all had a part in it. It was like having a dream band. You can feel it in the music. It was just really wonderful. I haven't had the experience of doing a record like that since maybe KISS' first album. I felt like I was 20 years old again.”


Peter Criss' tracks range from the balls-out opener “Rock, Rockin' Rock & Roll” and the gleefully adolescent “Hard Rock Knockers” to the theatrical “Creepy Crawlers” and the Sun Records-flavored, truck driver-celebrating “Rubberneckin'.” Elsewhere Criss is more serious, invoking faith and social commentary on songs such as “Murder,” “Justice,” “For the Money” and “Walking on Water.” The latter — “Probably my favorite song on the album,” Criss says — was inspired by his battle with breast cancer and his wife and manager Gigi's own health struggles.


	“There's a little bit of everything in there,” Criss notes. “Now that I'm a senior citizen or whatever, I wanted to write a little about politics, a little good ol' rock ‘n' roll. Music is so powerful, as you know. You can really pour your heart and soul into something…and I did. I hope my fans love it. I promised them I would do a rock album after One For All, and I kept my promise.”

	











	Promotion plans for Peter Criss are a somewhat up in the air. At 11 a.m. ET on Friday he'll sign copies of the album at Rough Trade Below in New York City's Rockefeller Plaza, and Criss is looking at signing events in other cities in the new year. He acknowledges that at his age and after several shoulder surgeries “it's taking a little more time to get around the (drums),” but he doesn't rule out playing live to support the album.


	“If the album really knocks the fans out, would I go out? Sure,” he says. “I wouldn't mind getting back on stage, getting the guys together to do a couple shows. Why not? I'm in pretty good condition for an old guy; everything is working, maybe a little bit of arthritis here and there, but I still play the drums a few times a week. So, yeah, I hope it does get to that point. I'm just gonna let it flow and see how my fans accept it.”


	In the meantime Criss is still basking in the glow of the Kennedy Center Honors, which took place on Dec. 7 in Washington, D.C., where KISS was feted by magician Cris Angel and performances from Garth Brooks (“Shout It Out Loud”),  Marcus King (Criss' signature song “Beth”) and Cheap Trick (“Rock and Roll All Nite”). “It was great. It was an honor,” says Criss, who served three tenures with KISS, departing for good — again acrimoniously — in 2004. He appeared amicably with bandmates Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley in D.C. but acknowledges that “we don't keep in touch.”


	Nevertheless, he adds, “I'm a kid from the streets of Brooklyn. I grew up in a cold-water flat with…seven of us. So coming from a tough neighborhood to standing in the Oval Office with the president was quite a thrill. I'm a big history buff; I couldn't believe I was in the room where Roosevelt, Lincoln, Kennedy…all these great presidents were. You can feel the vibes. Only four other bands got this award, and here we are, KISS. That was something.” And despite continuing controversies swirling around Pres. Donald Trump's realignments of the Kennedy Center, Criss says there were no political considerations on his part.

	











	“Look, it was an honor; how many chances to go you get to go to the White House and get a medal?” he explains. “I'm not a politician. I'm not a political guy. That's how I answered the questions; ‘I'm not political. I'm just proud to be here. Am I a Trump supporter? I'm a supporter of the president of the United States. I'm proud to be an American, and only in America can four guys like us, from the streets, be in the White House getting such a great award.'”


	Making the occasion bittersweet, however, was KISS guitarist Ace Frehley's absence following his death on Oct. 16 at the age of 74, following a fall in his home studio three weeks prior. “That was really hard for me,” says Criss, who spoke to Frehley shortly before his passing. “He was so excited. He was like, ‘Wow Cat, I can't believe we're getting this award!' I haven't heard him that excited for a while. He was getting ready to tour again, working on his new album…He was really up.” Criss says Frehley's daughter Monique accepted his medal during the White House presentation, while her mother and Frehley's ex-wife Jeanette was also in attendance.


	“I got to sit next to Ace's empty chair, where his medal was,” Criss says. “I'm still mourning over him. I can't believe he's gone. We were extremely close. It's been very hard.”

Slated to perform Dec. 18-21 at L.A.'s Fonda Theatre, the Grammy winner will give ""a substantial donation for the children"" instead.


													By
												

	Gail Mitchell



	To celebrate the 26th edition of his House Full of Toys holiday benefit concert, Stevie Wonder said in a promo video that he was “switching things up.” Instead of performing for one night, the 25-time Grammy-winning legend would perform across four nights — Dec. 18, 19, 20 and 21 — at the Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, however, Wonder is canceling his “big idea” owing to “little time” — with plans to present the benefit concert again next year.

	In a statement Wonder read on his L.A. radio station KJLH, he explained, “A week and a half ago I came up with the idea of doing four nights at the Fonda Theatre to raise money for House Full of Toys. Big idea. Little time. So because of that little time, I've decided to cancel all four shows. Yet still I will this year put my money where my heart is by giving a substantial donation for the children for House Full of Toys. And next year, we will again do House Full of Toys with the big idea and enough time to put it together.”


	People who purchased tickets are being emailed about refunds.


	As per tradition, Wonder's annual benefit concert asks that attendees bring an “unwrapped toy or unwrapped gift of joy.” Presented by the singer/songwriter's nonprofit We Are You Foundation, House Full of Toys helps assist children, people with disabilities and families in need.

	











	In past years, House Full of Toys has welcomed performers such as Lionel Richie, Queen Latifah, Jazmine Sullivan, Anderson .Paak and Ella Mai in addition to Wonder. The 2024 edition of House Full of Toys — tied to Wonder's “Sing Your Song! As We Fix Our Nation's Broken Heart” tour that year — featured Jon Batiste, Lucky Daye and El DeBarge.

The Nov. 22-23 festival in Los Angeles incorporated a flurry of clean power initiatives. 


													By
												

	Katie Bain



	A flurry of initiatives at Camp Flog Gnaw 2025 helped make it one of the most sustainable editions of the fest to date.


	For the second year in a row, Camp Flog Gnaw incorporated clean power solutions across its site at the Dodger Stadium Grounds in Los Angeles during the Nov. 22-23 fest, which featured headliners Tyler, The Creator, A$AP Rocky, Childish Gambino, Doechii and Clipse.


	These projects were done in collaboration with Camp Flog Gnaw producers AEG Presents and Goldenvoice, along with the longstanding sustainability nonprofit REVERB, which consults on sustainability initiatives across the music industry, with a focus on touring and live events.


	A representative for REVERB tells Billboard that the festival's Gnaw Stage was powered entirely by stadium shore power, which pulled electricity already available from Dodger Stadium's grid power connection and entirely eliminated the use of diesel generators at the stage. The use of shore power also reduced on-site equipment and simplified production logistics. The rep noted that this power method demonstrated that where permanent electrical infrastructure exists, grid power can be a reliable and lower-impact alternative to traditional generator-based stage power.Meanwhile, the festival's main stage was powered by a battery-first diesel hybrid system, with diesel-powered generators on site only as a backup power source. Battery, solar and shore power systems also supported the main entrance and box offices, merchandise, food operations and other site infrastructure.


	Overall, these initiatives resulted in the avoidance of 76.5 metric tons of CO₂ emissions, a number equivalent to the emissions from 18 gasoline-powered vehicles being driven for a year. They also resulted in the avoidance of using roughly 7,496 gallons of diesel fuel.


	These initiatives were similar to those introduced at the 2024 edition of the Portola festival, which is also produced by AEG and Goldenvoice and which, in 2024, avoided using 6,053 gallons of diesel fuel.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	Hot on Instagram this AM: Warner Bros and Legendary's new Tom Cruise movie directed by 4x Oscar winner Alejandro González Iñárritu has been titled Digger and will hit theaters on Oct. 2, 2026 — that's the prized frame where Warner Bros/DC's Joker bowed in 2019.


	Watch the first teaser footage above and see the poster below.


	The tagline for the pic on the poster is “a comedy of catastrophic proportions.” There was buzz out there that the movie was about the most powerful global figure who tries to convince everyone he's a savior. 


González Iñárritu told us at Cannes in response to that, “No, the thing that I can tell you. This is a wild comedy of catastrophic proportions. It's insane. He makes me laugh every day. The range that I discovered working with Tom is unprecedented for me as a director. I was so fu*king impressed and happy.”

Digger is González Iñárritu's first movie since directing 2022's Bardo: False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths for Netflix. The Mexico-born filmmaker won the Academy Award for Best Director for the 2015 Leonardo DiCaprio western The Revenant and three Oscars for Best Picture, Directing and Original Screenplay for 2016's Birdman, starring Michael Keaton, Emma Stone, Ed Norton and Zach Galifianakis.


	The teaser shows Cruise in cowboy boots dancing with a shovel in what looks to be a Los Angeles-type of low-rent apartment, as well as on a pier. He appears to be a bit disheveled.


	Also opening on October 2 next year is Amazon MGM Studios' Verity, director Michael Showalter's feature take on the Colleen Hoover novel, starring Dakota Johnson and Anne Hathaway.

	A number of technicians have walked off the West Virginia set of the U.S. gun crisis drama The Gun on Second Street after production refused to recognize the crew's union, IATSE said Thursday.


	Per the union, “a clear majority” of the films' crew has signaled the desire to form a union after a series of labor issues. Crew members have reported below-industry-standard wages and health/retirement benefits and also say they've been misclassified as independent contractors. 


The Gun on Second Street, which is an independent crime drama written and directed by Rohit Karn Batra, is shooting entirely in the Wheeling, West Virginia area. It is operating under a contract with SAG-AFTRA but not agreements with the DGA, Teamsters or IATSE. The film's cast includes Tom Arnold, Rumer Willis, Noah Fearnley, Shô Oyamada, Poppy Delevingne, Jack Kesy, and Dianna Agron.

	Per IATSE, crew members gave a deadline of 10:30 a.m. ET on Thursday for production leadership to engage in talks before going on strike. The international union has also ordered all of its members not to cross the picket line or accept work from the production, should they try to replace striking crew.


	“Every production, regardless of budget or political connections, must respect the rights of the people who make film and television possible. The Alliance is prepared to support this crew as they take collective action to secure safe working conditions, fair compensation, proper classification and a voice on the job,” IATSE International President Matthew D. Loeb said in a statement Thursday. “These workers deserve the same rights and protections film and tv workers have across the country. I'm proud of this crew for standing together in this moment and fighting for what's right in the face of tremendous pressure. It is now the producers' responsibility to meet them at the bargaining table and negotiate in good faith.”

EXCLUSIVE: YouTube has terminated two prominent channels that used artificial intelligence to create fake movie trailers, Deadline can reveal.


	The Google-owned video giant has switched off Screen Culture and KH Studio, which together boasted well over 2 million subscribers and more than a billion views.


	The channels have been replaced with the message: “This page isn't available. Sorry about that. Try searching for something else.”


	Screen Culture and KH Studio were approached for comment. They are based in India and Georgia, respectively.


	Earlier this year, YouTube suspended ads on Screen Culture and KH Studio following a Deadline investigation into fake movie trailers plaguing the platform since the rise of generative AI.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The channels later returned to monetization when they started adding “fan trailer,” “parody” and “concept trailer” to their video titles. But those caveats disappeared In recent months, prompting concern in the fan-made trailer community.


	YouTube's position is that the channels' decision to revert to their previous behavior violated its spam and misleading-metadata policies. This resulted in their termination.


	“The monster was defeated,” one YouTuber told Deadline following the enforcement action.


	Deadline's investigation revealed that Screen Culture spliced together official footage with AI images to create franchise trailers that duped many YouTube viewers. 


	Screen Culture founder Nikhil P. Chaudhari said his team of a dozen editors exploited YouTube's algorithm by being early with fake trailers and constantly iterating with videos.

	











	For example, Screen Culture had created 23 versions of a trailer for The Fantastic Four: First Steps by March, some of which outranked the official trailer in YouTube search results. More recent examples include HBO's new Harry Potter series and Netflix's Wednesday.


	Our deep dive into fake trailers revealed that instead of protecting copyright on these videos, a handful of Hollywood studios, including Warner Bros Discovery and Sony, secretly asked YouTube to ensure that the ad revenue from the AI-heavy videos flowed in their direction. The studios declined to comment.


	Disney properties featured prominently on Screen Culture and KH Studio. The Mouse House sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google last week, claiming that its AI training models and services infringe on its copyrights on a “massive scale.”

	British actors are taking a stand against body scans on film and TV sets amid a growing AI row.


	Members of Equity have voted overwhelmingly to refuse the digital scans in a landmark indicative ballot held by the UK performers' union, which underlines a desire for artificial intelligence protections in contracts.


	Equity asked its 7,000 members: “Are you prepared to refuse digital scanning on set to secure adequate AI protections?” Harriet Walter, Hugh Bonneville, and Adrian Lester were among the 99% who voted, “Yes.” The ballot turnout was 75%.


	Equity fears that actors are being digitally scanned and their data is being used without consent, potentially to train AI models. There is no suggestion that this is happening at present.

	As it is an indicative ballot, it is not binding and does not legally cover Equity members to take industrial action. For that, a statutory ballot is needed.


	Instead, Equity will use the vote as leverage in negotiations with Pact, the UK producer trade body, over a new collective agreement for performers. Pact said Equity is pushing for guardrails that “extend beyond the established safeguards already proven to protect actors around the world.”


	The current UK Pact-Equity agreement does not contain a single reference to AI. Equity's recent deal with the BBC, which encompasses shows like Doctor Who, only includes a holding clause saying AI terms will apply once the industry is agreed.


	Equity General Secretary Paul W Fleming said: “Artificial intelligence is a generation-defining challenge. And for the first time in a generation, Equity's film and TV members have shown that they are willing to take industrial action.”

	











	“90% of TV and film is made on these agreements. Over three quarters of artists working on them are union members. This shows that the workforce is willing to significantly disrupt production unless they are respected, and decades of erosion in terms and conditions begins to be reversed.


	“The US streamers and PACT need to step away from the brink, and respect this show of strength. We need adequate AI protections which build on, not merely replicate, those agreed after the SAG-AFTRA strike in the USA over two years ago.


	“The union believes this can be resolved through negotiation, but 18 months of talks have led us to this stalemate. With fresh AI proposals, significant movement on royalties, and a package of modern terms and conditions, PACT and allied producers can turn this around. The ball is in their court when we return to the table in January.”


	A Pact spokesperson said: “The majority of productions don't scan cast. In some types of production (such as those with SFX), scanning has taken place for many years – long before new technologies like Generative AI. Cast are informed when and why they are being scanned – most commonly for editing purposes. Producers abide by the legal requirements for the treatment and storage of scans.


	“During the recent negotiations, Pact offered Equity terms on AI consistent with those that are in place in other countries. Equity is asking for future-facing protections that extend beyond the established safeguards already proven to protect actors around the world. Pact has assured Equity that we will keep the dialogue open as things develop so we can have an informed discussion.”


	Equity's indicative ballot could be followed by a statutory ballot. Strike action is not being ruled out further down the line, Deadline understands.


	SAG-AFTRA's deal with U.S. studios, symbolically endorsed by Equity, included the principle of “informed consent,” meaning clauses around digital replicas should be clearly signposted in contracts (specifically in bold, capital letters) and not buried in terms and conditions. 


	Digital scans largely affect background actors, who, once scanned, can be replicated by AI. Pierre Bergman, a doyen among UK background artists, said many are bounced into scans out of fear of having a “target painted on their back” by employers.


	Adrian Wootton, CEO of the British Film Commission, said it is “working with all parties to reach a fair, reasonable solution to this very complex issue as soon as possible.”


	He added: “All are committed to developing fair, effective guardrails and provisions for the use of AI in film and TV, and it is in everyone's interests to exhaust all of the available options for negotiation. To that end, the British Film Commission will be liaising with Pact and Equity, with the aim of supporting an agreement satisfactory to all parties.”

VFX Studios have been scanning actors for a while, not to use for AI, but because you can't actually throw an actor off a building. You need digital doubles of the actor to perform actions that neither the actor nor stunt performers can do for safety reasons.

No Digital ID's – period. Your biological IP (Intellectual Property) is not for sale. Most of the sell on this will be under the guise of “Safety and Security” and many will consent. Everyone is being played for fools. Never has power been a friend of the common people nor does anything for our own good. This time is no different. The artists who stand together against this are the canaries in the coal mine.

Privacy seems to be a “thus for me, not for thee” proposition of the elite lording oppression and dystopia over the population. Anyone who consents is a fool who knows nothing about the way the world has been – and will be – run, if we consent to the oppression. And those of us who do comprehend will be forced to suffer the fate of the imbeciles.

Leonardo DiCaprio revealed he has never rewatched his 1997 film “Titanic.”

“No, I haven't seen it in forever.”  DiCaprio, 51, responded when asked by Jennifer Lawrence during Variety and CNN's Actors on Actors conversation Wednesday.

“Oh, you should. I bet you could watch it as a movie now, it's so good!” Lawrence, 35, pushed back.

DiCaprio went on to explain that he doesn't “really watch my films,” before admitting to watching “some.”

He then asked the “Hunger Games” actress if she watches some of the films from her catalog. 

“No. I've never made something like ‘Titanic.' If I did I would watch it,” she answered with a short laugh.

However, when asked about the last time she watched one of her films, the Oscar winner admitted that she drunkenly rewatched her 2013 film, “American Hustle.”

“I was like, ‘I wonder if I'm good at acting?' I put it on, and I don't remember what the answer is.”

Elsewhere in their conversation, Lawrence also admitted to another funny on-set happening involving ambien.

At one point, she revealed that she accidentally took the sleep aid before heading to work that morning which resulted in her “hallucinating” during a key scene. 

“It was a dance scene with Phillip Seymour-Hoffman on the second ‘Hunger Games' movie and I was hallucinating,” she said. 

The incident resulted in the actress struggling with “the memorization” part of her brain as she tried to remember her lines.

“Elizabeth Banks got really annoyed with me because maybe, she didn't know that I was on an Ambien. But I kept asking the director, ‘Wait, and what does this mean?'” she recalled.

Lawrence and DiCaprio previously starred alongside each other in the 2021 Netflix film “Don't Look Up.”

The two actors are reportedly set to reunite for Martin Scorsese's horror film, “What Happens at Night,” per the Hollywood Reporter.

Tara Reid is speaking out after police closed down the investigation into her claims she was drugged at a bar in Chicago last month. 

The entire ordeal is “truly heartbreaking,” the “American Pie” actress's representative shared with Page Six on Wednesday.

“All of the bullying I have been subjected to since and everyone twisting reality without the facts they weren't even there to witness is truly affecting my mental health, and I need it to stop,” she said.

Advertisement

“They are making it seem like I chugged all this wine at once and ended up on a stretcher, but after reviewing the footage that is not what happened at all,” she explained.

Advertisement

“In fact I witnessed in the footage when I arrived back from smoking with the person I only took one sip of wine in over 30 minutes and when the bartender asked me if I wanted another drink I signalled no because I still had a drink I didn't barely touch,” she claimed.

Reid also told the Daily Mail on Wednesday that 33 minutes of footage of the Nov. 23 incident — during which she was seen in a wheelchair in a hotel lobby before being taken out on a stretcher — was unaccounted for.

A Rosemont, Ill., police spokesperson told People on Wednesday that the case had been closed on Dec. 11, explaining that “no other evidence” had been found to support Reid's claim.

“We don't want to say what she's claiming is false,” the spokesperson said, adding that there were stretches of time “not seen” on the surveillance video. 

Advertisement

They noted that they could only investigate the footage they had access to, which they felt did not provide proof of an alleged drugging. “That's all we can do,” the spokesperson said. 

A rep for Reid did not immediately return Page Six's request for further comment.

The actress, 50, told Page Six on Dec. 8 that she felt “judged” as footage of the incident proliferated in the media. 

“I've been honest about the fact that I don't remember anything after my first drink,” she told us. 

“All I said was that I felt something was wrong and that I felt I may have been drugged, because I have no other explanation for why I woke up in a hospital gown with no memory of how I got there.”

She added that it “has been incredibly painful” to see people “twist [her] words and attack [her]” for not remembering details of what allegedly transpired. 

“I feel bullied and judged for something I cannot recall. I'm trying to heal, but the public scrutiny is making that very difficult, and I've been afraid to even leave my house,” she said. 

“No one ends up in the hospital for around 11 hours from drinking wine alone. I hadn't taken any medication that day, and I know something wasn't right.”

The “Sharknado” star first spoke out in November about an alleged drugging after footage showed her being removed from a Chicago hotel bar on a stretcher.

The “Van Wilder” actress told Page Six at the time that she checked into her room and then headed to the bar, where she encountered YouTubers in the lobby. 

She claimed one of them later joined her for a cigarette, and that when she returned to the bar, her drink was covered by a napkin — which she didn't do, she explained to TMZ.

Reid alleged she woke up in a hospital eight hours later, claiming doctors informed her she'd been drugged.

She filed a police report obtained by Page Six in November hat stated she was “willing to prosecute” — however, initial surveillance findings failed to reveal evidence of misconduct, the Rosemont Public Safety Department said on Dec. 3. 

“While video surveillance showed Tara Reid at the hotel bar, at no time did video show anyone tampering with or adding something to her drink,” they said in a statement earlier this month.

“We can confirm that a bartender covered her drink when she left the bar which is standard practice for bartenders to do.”

The message concluded by stating that authorities found “no criminal act that has been committed” in the case.

Prince Harry is hitting the polo field in Aspen, Colo. ahead of his future holiday plans with Meghan Markle and their family. 

Photos showed the Duke of Sussex, 41, playing a friendly game of polo with pals on Wednesday in what appears to be a sporty break for the royal.

He appeared lively as he showed off his well-practiced skills on top of a horse in his light blue Aspen Valley team polo jersey and white pants. He finished off his look with a pair of dark shades and the rest of his athletic gear.

The prince previously made an appearance in the Colorado hot spot for a charity polo match in 2021 following the birth of his daughter, Princess Lilibet, now 4.

Hours before his polo photos surfaced, an additional set of photos were posted showing Harry skiing with his friend Nacho Figueras.

“Prince Harry was with Nacho for about four hours on the mountains. The pair spent the day skiing and enjoyed lunch together at one of the restaurants at the resort,” a source told Hello! Magazine.

“Harry seemed happy and was also joined by a number of male friends on the slopes.”

According to the outlet, neither Markle, 44, nor their children made the trip with him.

However, as Page Six previously reported earlier this week, the royals are expected to still celebrate the Christmas holiday at home in Montecito, Calif., alongside their kids and Markle's mom, Doria Ragland.

But the parents have reportedly made plans to jet away with friends shortly after for a glamorous New Year's vacation out of the country.

The holiday travels come as the “With Love, Meghan” star faces scrutiny for allegedly not showing up to support her ailing father, Thomas Markle, shortly after he underwent emergency surgery for a dangerous blood clot and had his leg amputated as a result.

While a rep for the royal previously claimed that the Duchess of Sussex had, in fact, reached out to her father, Thomas alleged that he had not received any correspondence from his daughter. 

“I don't want to die estranged from Meghan. I want to meet my grandkids. It might be nice to meet her husband too,” Thomas told the Daily Mail at the time.

In the most recent update, the Sussex rep had since told Page Six that Markle finally managed to get a letter to her father.

“It has been exceedingly difficult for the duchess to contact her father privately, despite her efforts over the past several days,” said the rep. “With the support of reliable and trusted contacts, her correspondence is now safely in his hands.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Ex-Astronomer HR exec Kristin Cabot finally breaks silence on Coldplay kiss cam scandal: ‘Bad decision'","https://pagesix.com/2025/12/18/celebrity-news/kristin-cabot-finally-breaks-silence-on-coldplay-kiss-cam-scandal-with-andy-byron/","Thu, 18 Dec 2025 14:11:00 GMT","

Kristin Cabot has finally broken her silence after she and her former boss Andy Byron went viral for getting caught canoodling on the kiss cam at a Coldplay concert over the summer.

Cabot, 53, debated speaking publicly about the scandal but eventually agreed to do an interview with the New York Times for an article published Thursday.

She insisted to the newspaper that she was not in a sexual relationship with Byron, claiming that before that night, they had never even kissed.

Advertisement

“I made a bad decision and had a couple of High Noons and danced and acted inappropriately with my boss,” she explained, making sure to note that “it's not nothing.”

Advertisement

However, she feels she “took accountability” and “gave up [her] career” for the ordeal.

“That's the price I chose to pay,” she said. “I want my kids to know that you can make mistakes, and you can really screw up, but you don't have to be threatened to be killed for them.”

Cabot said she and Byron “clicked, stylistically,” when she interviewed to work for Astronomer in the summer of 2024. Soon after she was hired that November, she and Byron started speaking every day, sometimes three times a day.

In the spring, Cabot, the then-head of HR, claimed she and Byron, the then-CEO, bonded over both “going through” separations, which “sort of strengthened [their] connection.”

Advertisement

She quickly developed “big feelings” for him and started fantasizing about the romantic possibilities but knew she couldn't “get too carried away” given their professional dynamic.

She told the Times that by the time she invited Byron to the Boston Coldplay concert in July as her plus-one, she had a full-blown “crush.” However, it wasn't a proper date, as they were with a group of her close friends.

Advertisement

Cabot admitted that she and Byron each had a couple of tequila cocktails, and as the concert went on, they began to look like a couple. Byron was dancing behind Cabot when she took his hands and wrapped his arms around her, she said.

That's when the camera panned to the pair, and they were shown on the jumbotron in an intimate embrace.

“Whoa, look at these two,” frontman Chris Martin exclaimed into the mic.

However, once the duo noticed they were on the big screen, Byron let out a “f–king hell, it's me” and immediately ducked out of view, while Cabot, who acknowledged that “this is awkward,” hid her face in embarrassment.

“Either they're having an affair, or they're just very shy,” Martin joked as the audience erupted in laughter, with videos of the moment quickly spreading like wildfire online.

“I was so embarrassed and so horrified,” Cabot told the Times. “I'm the head of HR, and he's the CEO. It's, like, so cliché and so bad.”

She said she and Byron immediately drafted up an email to Astronomer's Board of Directors, but by the time they hit “send,” the footage was everywhere.

The board then launched an investigation into the matter, which resulted in both Byron and Cabot — who were both technically married at the time — being placed on leave.

The former resigned the next day, while his direct report followed suit less than a week later, though she claimed to the Times that the board had actually asked her to return to her role.

Advertisement

Cabot's family and friends — those who didn't jump ship amid the subsequent public scrutiny and consistent death threats — were devastated. She said her children became “afraid that [she] was going to die and they were going to die.”

Advertisement

In early September, Cabot's estranged husband, CEO of Privateer Rum Andrew Cabot, revealed they “were privately and amicably separated several weeks before the Coldplay concert.”

She filed for divorce in mid-August.

It's unclear where Byron and his wife, Megan Kerrigan, stand, but she did instantly remove her married name from her Facebook page before deleting her account altogether.

Cabot said she and Byron were in touch amid the fallout but eventually agreed that “speaking with each other was going to make it too hard for everyone to move on and heal.”

Byron declined to comment on the article.

Rob Reiner's son Nick Reiner displayed “abnormal” and “drained” behavior days before he was charged with murder for stabbing his parents to death.

An employee who works at Sinclair Gas station in the Brentwood area of California told TMZ that Nick looked tired and was unusually standoffish about two weeks ago. 

The worker said Nick, who is usually social and friendly at the gas station, bought a pack of cigarettes and did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

The outlet reported that the Reiners were frequent customers, with one employee saying he had known Nick for 15 years.

As Page Six previously reported, Rob, 78, and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, 70, were found dead in their Brentwood home on Sunday.

Nick was arrested and charged with two counts of first-degree murder. He is currently being held without bail at the Twin Towers Correctional Facility in LA.

The Post obtained surveillance video of Nick calmly walking past the Sinclair Gas station, which was blocks away from his parents' home, just hours before Rob and Michele were killed.

The “Being Charlie” writer had a history of violent outbursts and drug addiction.

The night before the killings, a source confirmed to The Post that Nick “freaked out” and had a massive blow-up with his parents at Conan O'Brien's Christmas party. 

On Wednesday, the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner released the couple's official cause of death. The filmmaker and the actress died from “multiple sharp force injuries” and their passing was listed as a homicide.

That same day, Rob and Michele's kids, Romy, 28, and Jake, 34, released a statement about the “horrific” murder of their parents.

“Words cannot even begin to describe the unimaginable pain we are experiencing every moment of the day,” they told Page Six.

“The horrific and devastating loss of our parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, is something that no one should ever experience,” the siblings added.

“They weren't just our parents; they were our best friends. We are grateful for the outpouring of condolences, kindness, and support we have received not only from family and friends but people from all walks of life.” 

Romy and Jake concluded their statement by asking for “respect and privacy” as they navigate this difficult time. They did not mention their brother, Nick.

When a monarch butterfly flaps its wings, Apple TV green-lights 16 new shows. While most might never be seen or heard from again [did anyone else know that Megan Thee Stallion and Psy hosted a show called KPOPPED together?], others are attached to big, expensive IP and therefore deserve your undivided attention. One of those is Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters, a spin-off of 2014's Godzilla, a franchise-launcher for a franchise that didn't start clicking until King Kong got involved. Debuting in 2023, Monarch stars Wyatt and Kurt Russell, who share the role of Lee Shaw across two timelines as they hunt the Titans, the race of supermonsters better known to the rest of the world as Kaiju. It's all part of the Monsterverse, and today, Apple announced that the universe is expanding enough for Wyatt Russell to star in his own spin-off.

Here's the synopsis for the still untitled series: “Starring and executive produced by Wyatt Russell, the spinoff series will follow the story of Colonel Lee Shaw, an American operative who in 1984 went on a secret mission behind enemy lines in an attempt to stop the Soviets from unleashing a horrific new Titan big enough to destroy the U.S. and turn the tide of the Cold War.”

The series will be showrun by Emmy-nominated screenwriter Joby Harold. Harold was previously nominated for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series for Obi-Wan Kenobi, which he created, produced, and wrote. His other screenwriting credits include The Flash, Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts, and King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword.

There's no word on when the show will be released or whether Godzilla will make guest appearances, but more monsters are on the way. The second season of the mainline Monarch series hits Apple TV on February 27, 2026.

FCC Chair Brendan Carr doesn't care what the website says; the FCC is not an independent agency. At least that's what he told Congress today. Testifying before the Senate's commerce, science, and transportation agency, Carr, using the overworked semantics that are the backbone of Project 2025 legislation, declared the FCC “is not an independent agency, formally speaking.”

During a surprising exchange, Senator Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, who didn't even get to his “gotcha question,” asked whether the FCC was independent because the website says it's independent. Still, after Carr attempted to give a lengthy answer about how “there's a test in the law” regarding how we've all been misinterpreting the role of the FCC for the last century, Luján said, “It's yes or no, Brendan! On your website, it simply says, man, ‘the FCC is independent.' This isn't a trick question.”

“The FCC is not,” Carr responded. He continued to say that [eye roll] [jerkoff hand motion] the “sin qua non of independence would be removable by the president.”

“Just so you know, Brendan, on your website it just simply says, man, the FCC's independent,” Luján said. It wouldn't be for long. Before the exchange, the FCC's website described the commission as “an independent U.S. government agency overseen by Congress.” However, after the exchange, the site was updated to remove the word “independent.” The Congress.gov website, however, has not been updated.

KIM: Is Trump your boss?

CARR: The president designated chair of the FCC

K: So he's your boss

C: Look–

K: You swore an oath. Does it have the word ‘president' in it?

C: I'm not tracking

K: Do you remember the oath?

C: Sir–

K: What are you protecting?

C: In this job–

K: The Constitution

It makes a certain sense that Kerry Washington and Elisabeth Moss would end up in the same series together. They're two titans of 2010s TV who've also both dabbled in limited series since the ends of Scandal and Mad Men. (Of course, Moss did all of The Handmaid's Tale since then, too.) Apparently, they agree; the two both executive produce Imperfect Women, a new eight-episode series coming to Apple TV early next year. They're also bringing Kate Mara (Friendship, American Horror Story) with them. 

Here's the synopsis for Imperfect Women: 

Based on Araminta Hall's novel of the same name, “Imperfect Women” examines a crime that shatters the lives of a decades-long friendship of three women. The unconventional thriller explores guilt and retribution, love and betrayal, and the compromises we make that alter our lives irrevocably. As the investigation unravels, so does the truth about how even the closest friendships may not be what they seem.

Imperfect Women is created and showrun by Annie Weisman, who previously showran Physical at Apple TV and produced some of Desperate Housewives and Suburgatory on ABC. The ensemble cast of the series include names such as Leslie Odom Jr., Joel Kinnaman, Corey Stoll, and Sheryl Lee Ralph.

Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio discussed what they perceived as their bad habits during a sit-down for Variety's “Actors on Actors.”

“I think I shoot out a lot of ideas, sometimes unnecessarily,” DiCaprio said. He continued, “It's kind of like a shotgun spray of anything that comes to mind, and a lot of that may waste time for the focus of what we already know.”

Lawrence answered, “That sounds helpful. Because if it's not useful, then you just move on.” 

“Well, sometimes maybe it steers away from what is obvious,” DiCaprio answered. However, Lawrence argued that his ideas might sometimes, so she thought his “bad habit” was a good thing.  

As for Lawrence, she said, “My bad habit is that I am so good at letting go at the end of the day, that I don't think about the next day.”

She explained that while getting ready in hair and makeup, she has to scramble to learn her lines, which affects her acting in front of the cameras.

“It makes me not go crazy, but the next morning is hell,” the “Silver Linings Playbook” star quipped.

Lawrence shared in the Variety talk that while filming “Silver Linings Playbook,” she had to memorize a bunch of sports stats, which were difficult to remember.

“It's just numbers and sports, which I don't care about … but it turned out great,” she recalled.

The mom of two then said, “I nailed it on the first take, and then I [expletive] up every single other take until we finally moved on.”

DiCaprio lamented about not being able to say the tongue twister, “Spruce Goose,” while filming “The Aviator,” and told Lawrence, “I couldn't, literally couldn't say the words.”

“It's humiliating, and it's like going to school with your underwear on,” the “Titanic” actor admitted.

Lawrence and DiCaprio starred in “Don't Look Up” together, and they're reuniting for an upcoming Martin Scorsese film called “What Happens at Night,” per Deadline.

Based on the novel by Peter Cameron, the haunting thriller centers around a couple who make a trip to Europe in hopes of adopting a baby. 

The two stay at a strange hotel full of unusual characters, and they have to navigate being in a foreign environment while navigating their struggling marriage.

According to Netflix, “What Happens at Night” is set to start filming in January 2026.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Timothée Chalamet Twins with Surprise Date at ‘Marty Supreme' Premiere","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/timothee-chalamet-marty-supreme-premiere-mom/","Thu, 18 Dec 2025 14:39:27 GMT","

Timothée Chalamet arrived at the New York City premiere for his upcoming “Marty Supreme” with a surprise date–his mother, Nicole Flender. The mom-and-son duo rocked matching bright orange hues, continuing the color palette that has defined the “Marty Supreme” press tour. 

Chalamet, 29, wore a double-breasted suit designed by Haider Ackermann for Tom Ford. He paired the ensemble with a matching orange scarf and watch as well as a Cartier necklace. Flender posed alongside her son, wearing a halter neck gown in “Marty Supreme” orange and carrying a gold purse. 

Chalamet also wore an all-orange outfit at the Los Angeles premiere of “Marty Supreme,” where he twinned in nearly head-to-toe Chrome Hearts with his girlfriend, Kylie Jenner. The reality television star and cosmetics mogul wore a bright orange gown by the brand. Chalamet opted for an orange Chrome Hearts leather suit and a pair of Timberlands. Jenner paired her stunning attire with a massive cross necklace while Chalamet's accessory of choice was a custom bag shaped like a ping-pong paddle. 

The outing marked the couple's second red carpet appearance since their debut in May. 

Film premieres aren't the only place Chalamet is showing up in the neon orange. 

A “leaked Zoom call” posted to YouTube by A24 reveals a meeting between Chalamet and a marketing team where the orange motif was born. In the video, Chalamet talks with the group about great movie marketing campaigns, eventually turning the conversation to “Barbie” and its association with the color pink.

“Everywhere I stepped, I would be inundated with pink. What would the same be for ‘Marty Supreme'?” he asks. The group agreed on orange because Chalamet's character, Marty Mauser, uses an orange ping-pong ball.

“How do we not just cop [sic] the vibe of ‘Barbie'? Hardcore orange,” Chalamet answers his own question before pulling up a PNG of the color that would come to define the “Marty Supreme” press campaign. The actor also showed edited photos of landmarks like the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower painted in the bright hue.  

Chalamet has since been rocking “Marty Supreme” orange at premieres, press conferences and in social media posts. He's also sported a now-coveted windbreaker that fans are scrambling to get their hands on. Chalamet has gifted various versions of the jacket, on which “Marty Supreme” is written above three stars, to fellow celebrities like Frank Ocean, Kid Cudi and even Tom Brady.

On December 16, the Empire State Building joined the trend, lighting up in bright orange as members of the “Marty Supreme” cast, and director Josh Safdie, posed at the top of the building. 

“Marty Supreme” arrives in theaters on December 25.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Dick Van Dyke's Wife Opens Up About Rob Reiner & His Wife in Heartfelt Reveal","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/dick-van-dyke-wife-rob-reiner-heartfelt-reveal/","Thu, 18 Dec 2025 07:59:45 GMT","

The late director and actor Rob Reiner spoke with deep affection about Dick Van Dyke and Mel Brooks just months before his death on December 14. During a September 2025 appearance on Ted Danson's podcast, “Where Everybody Knows Your Name,” Reiner reflected on the lasting genius of his father Carl Reiner's longtime collaborators and the comedy legacy that helped shape his own life and career.

During the podcast conversation, Reiner noted that his father, Carl Reiner, who died in 2020 at age 98, created “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” which starred Van Dyke and ran for five seasons through 1966.

Reiner said Van Dyke, who turned 100 on December 13, remained as sharp as ever. He also pointed out that Brooks, Carl's longtime comedy partner, turned 99 on June 28, 2025.

“[Van Dyke] is 100 this year. And Mel Brooks is 99 this year and, you know, these guys are still incredible,” Reiner said while speaking with Danson.

Reiner also spoke fondly about Carl Reiner and Brooks' legendary sketch “The 2000 Year Old Man,” which appeared on their comedy albums “2000 Years with Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks” in 1960 and “2000 and One Years with Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks” in 1961.

“If you listen to those albums, they're the most brilliant comedy albums ever done,” Reiner said. “And as a kid, I used to come home and listen to it every day. I would listen to it, and I would know whether or not I could be friends with somebody if they got that.”

The albums, he explained, helped shape his sense of humor and his understanding of comedy as a shared language.

In a separate March 2023 interview on “The Howard Stern Show,” Reiner recalled visiting his father on the set of “The Dick Van Dyke Show” during his teenage years.

He said watching Carl write dozens of scripts on his own left him both inspired and overwhelmed. At the time, he wondered if he could ever match that level of discipline and creative output.

Reiner also shared a moment that stayed with him for life. As a teenager, he once pitched a joke to Carl and Brooks for a performance on “The Ed Sullivan Show.”

“I had this joke and they actually used it. That was like the greatest thrill,” Reiner said.

After the tragic passing of Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, Dick Van Dyke's wife, Arlene Silver, spoke publicly about the loss in a December 15 Instagram video, according to People.

Silver reflected on the emotional whiplash of celebrating Van Dyke's 100th birthday while learning of the Reiners' deaths during the same weekend.

“Such a weird, wonderful, awful weekend. I can't talk about this horrible thing… I mean, Dick's birthday was so amazing, so over-the-top beautiful, and then this. I was relieved and happy, and then this happened yesterday,” Silver said.

She also spoke about the deep bond between the two couples.

“And then Rob and Carl [Reiner] were the first people I ever met with Dick. Rob and Michele were always together, like Dick and I. And I always felt part of the Reiner family; they always treated me like part of their family. And this is just unbelievable,” she said.

People reported that the Reiners' 32-year-old son, Nick, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder following his parents' deaths.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Rob Reiner and Wife Michele Case Update","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/rob-reiner-medical-examiner-case-update/","Thu, 18 Dec 2025 04:48:04 GMT","

Legendary actor Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele, were tragically killed in their home on Sunday, Dec. 14, and the medical examiner has now released the cause of death three days after their passing. 

The two died from “multiple sharp force injuries,” according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner. They also determined the manner of death to be “homicide.”

This comes after the couple's son, Nick Reiner, faces murder charges in the deaths of his parents and appeared in court on Wednesday, Dec. 17, having arrived in” a blue sleeveless vest and shackles, was seated behind glass in court and stared blankly as his lawyer, Alan Jackson, declined to enter a plea for his client,” according to PEOPLE.

The arraignment has been pushed back to January 7, according to the outlet.

Rob and Michele's other children, Romy and Jake, also released a statement about their parents passing. 

“Words cannot even begin to describe the unimaginable pain we are experiencing every moment of the day. The horrific and devastating loss of our parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, is something that no one should ever experience. They weren't just our parents; they were our best friends,” the family said in a statement to TMZ on December 17. “We are grateful for the outpouring of condolences, kindness, and support we have received not only from family and friends but people from all walks of life.”

“We now ask for respect and privacy, for speculation to be tempered with compassion and humanity, and for our parents to be remembered for the incredible lives they lived and the love they gave.”

During an appearance on a podcast in 2016, Nick admitted that it was hard for him while growing up as he had a famous father and grandfather. Feeling in the shadow of the two is what led to him abusing drugs, he explained. 

“I had no identity, and I had no passions,” he said. “And I think the reason I had no identity was because I have a famous dad and a famous grandpa, and that fame sort of informs who you are. So I wanted to edge out my own identity with a more rebellious, angry, drug-addicted sort of persona.”

Douglas Shaffer, who was the producer of the film ‘Being Charlie,' which was directed by Rob and was co-written by Nick, opened up about working on the film with the duo as well as his reaction to this news. 

“It was just a good experience for everybody involved,” Shaffer told Page Six. “And so that's why when all this stuff came up, it was just complete and total shock.”

“Nick… I thought the demons were like exorcised,” Shaffer continued. “After the movie, I felt like, ‘Okay, he's on the up and up. This is good. He's doing good.' I had no idea these other issues were happening. So it was a shock. I mean, I thought it was a home invasion at first when I heard. I had no idea.”

You keep talking about his 3 kids.  Rob adopted a daughter from Penny Marshall.  Her mother died several years ago.  She only had her father left.  You keep talking about his 3 kids  where is Tracy Reiner his 4th.  Her father was  murdered . Rob was her dad  Show respect for her also.  What a disrespectful slap in the face for Tracy.  He chose to adopt her and she deserves respect because that was her legal father  She never had brothers and sister   She was an only child  They were her half siblings.

Utterly pathetic and disgusting that his own son would inflict this pain on his parents and family, what satisfaction did he receive by harming his parents. That A BIG SIN in Gods eyes and I hope he rots in jail. I hope they make him suffer the way his parents suffered. No mercy for he gave his parents any mercy

No parent should see the child they brought into the world turn their rage into an attack like this.  None of us can imagine this horror.  No one knows what happened day in and day out behind those closed doors.
Rob's political views were very hateful against Trump.  He didn't miss an opportunity to spew.  He even commented on his disappointment that Trump's life was spared when he turned his head.  For this I don't respect Rob but for the pain and horror of this tragedy, I send my prayers.

Jessica Chastain‘s Apple TV series “The Savant” may be on hold, but her latest movie, out in February, is explosive enough to cause a new controversy on its own.

Comfort-cinema-opposed Mexican filmmaker Michel Franco brushed against hope and tenderness with his 2023 dementia-added love story “Memory,” but he's back in a pissed-off minor key over the state of the world — and especially the toxic codependence between the U.S. and his home country — in “Dreams.” 

Remember the strikes of 2023? How quaint. Back then, Franco shot his ninth feature on location in the San Francisco Bay Area, courtesy of an interim waiver, and with “Memory” star Jessica Chastain, newcomer Isaac Hernández, and Rupert Friend in the cast. It went on to premiere at the 2025 Berlin Film Festival, unfortunately winning no awards from Todd Haynes' jury, and finally secured distribution from Greenwich Entertainment earlier this year. Watch the trailer below.

In “Dreams,” Chastain plays a wealthy San Francisco arts patron whose life has been coddled and conflict-free, thanks to her powerful father. With a special interest in the ballet, she falls for a much-younger rising dancer (Hernández) while on a “business” trip to Mexico City, and he winds up illegally crossing the border through terrible circumstances to get to her. What could go wrong? It's an erotic, disturbing romance — in other words, career-characteristic work from the director of sibling incest thriller “Daniel and Ana.”

As I wrote in my review out of Berlin, this film is “an addictive and destructive love story as sharply wrought as the movie's grander political concerns… There's not a lot of hope in ‘Dreams,' and for that, it's a movie of our times and one that maybe can only exist because of them. It's about how the falsity of the American dream (a dream that is immigrants, after all) propels Mexican people to make the illegal dangerous crossing at all, and about how the U.S. and Mexico need each other in all ways.”

I also spoke to Franco and Chastain out of that festival, where Franco said, “I don't need to be liked as a filmmaker, for people to think, ‘Oh, he's a good person.' I have no trouble about that. I am more interested in representing life. What's going on between the two countries and what Mexicans and immigrants are living in the States on a daily basis is much more dramatic than even what we portrayed [in ‘Dreams']. So I wasn't shy about that. The main thing is it's true love. That's what makes it work, that they are in love, and that's why it's tragic.”

The movie arrives in theaters on February 27, 2026. Watch the trailer below.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:indiewire.com","To Lure Director Frank Darabont Out of Retirement, Only a Personal Favorite Like ‘Stranger Things' Would Do","https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/stranger-things-director-frank-darabont-retirement-1235168386/","Thu, 18 Dec 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

For years, Frank Darabont was one of the most in-demand directors in Hollywood. While his career started with writing B-movie fare like “A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors” and 1988's “The Blob,” his breakthrough was in 1994 with the poignant Stephen King adaptation “The Shawshank Redemption,” which he wrote and directed. The slow-burn success of that film, which bombed in theaters but has since become recognized as one of the greatest movies of all time, led to another Academy Award-nominated prison-based Stephen King drama, “The Green Mile,” the slightly less lauded “The Majestic,” and in 2007 a melding of his auteur chops and B-movie origins with yet another King adaptation, “The Mist.”

Darabont probably could have kept trucking along with movies (and King adaptations), but instead he turned his sights on another horror adaptation, developing “The Walking Dead” for AMC and building it into a massive hit… At least before he was fired due to fights over what was later reported to be massive proposed budget cuts for the second season by the cable network. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Darabont went on to create “Mob City” for TNT in 2013, but that was canceled after one season. Following that, Darabont worked as a script doctor on 2014's “Godzilla,” and wrote a draft of, and was planning on directing, the “Snow White & The Huntsman” sequel “The Huntsman: Winter's War,” until that seemingly fell apart due to the classic creative differences.

Since then? Darabont has been happily retired. Until now.

A few years back, the Duffer brothers, creators of the massive Netflix hit “Stranger Things,” had lunch with Darabont, where the director expressed his fandom for the show — he and his wife had already watched the first four seasons four or five times — and the Duffers expressed their fandom back. But then they called him and invited him to direct an episode in the final season of the series. And he said yes.

That fifth episode, titled “Shock Jock,” which will premiere on Netflix on Christmas Day (December 25), ended up becoming a double hit for Darabont when director Dan Trachtenberg had to drop out of directing the third episode, due to conflicts with the schedule for “Predator: Badlands.” While the Duffers floated moving Darabont to Episode 3, he told IndieWire he had another suggestion: “What if I do both?”

 










So 12 years after last sitting in the directing chair for “Mob City,” Darabont is back for not one, but two episodes of “Stranger Things” Season 5. The first, titled “The Turnbow Trap,” premiered as part of “Volume 1” on Thanksgiving Eve, and featured a “Home Alone”-style battle against a Demogorgon, as well as an iconic scene featuring Erica Sinclair (Priah Ferguson) drugging the entire Turnbow family with laced pie in order to save them from the villainous Vecna/Henry Creel (Jamie Campbell Bower).

As for “Shock Jock,” as you might expect, the whole production is tight-lipped on the content, though Russ Duffer recently posted on Instagram that, “‘Shock Jock' picks up moments after the end of ‘Sorcerer.' Frank Darabont is back, but he flexes very different muscles on this one than he did on ‘Turnbow Trap'— it's far darker, and far scarier.”

It also includes an Easter egg for something earlier in Darabont's career, as he revealed to IndieWire (given that the season takes place in 1987 and “Nightmare on Elm Street 3” came out in 1987, you can likely venture a guess as to what that might be), and a chance to work more with the complicated baddie Henry Creel, who only briefly appears in “The Turnbow Trap.”

 










To find out more from Darabont about why he came back to directing, what it would take for him to continue past “Stranger Things,” and a bit of a correction about an oft-reported story on his history with Stephen King and “The Dark Tower,” read on.

The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.

IndieWire: I was reading that the Duffers surprise-asked you to direct an episode, and that's what brought you out of retirement. Has nobody ever asked before?

Frank Darabont: [Laughs] Yeah, it was a surprise. I had been approached on a number of things through the years. But listen, after 30 years of being a workaholic machine in Hollywood, it's always easy to say no to pretty much everything. But when the Duffers offered, I was such a fan of the show that I actually had to say yes, and talked it over with my wife, and she said — because we both love the show so much — said, “Yeah, this will be great.” 

It was initially going to be one episode, Episode 5. And then the director they had for Episode 3 had to drop out because of scheduling things, because of the strike. So they said, “Hey, do you mind if we move you to Episode 3 instead?” And I said, “What if I do both?” That got me into six months in Atlanta, and I got to play pretty deeply in their sandbox.

 










This is just me intuiting from the outside, but it seems like TV led to some of your more frustrating experiences. Did you have any hesitation returning to TV, versus movies?

No, no. Not at all. Because in this situation, I'm a director for hire on a show that I love. I know they're going to give me excellent material, which they did. I had no battles to fight with a network or anything like that. I just had to show up and do the gig, which was very welcome. And I certainly trusted the Duffers to maintain their vision of the show that, God knows they've done four superb seasons so far. So I had no hesitation on that at all. 

What I said to them from the very start was: this is not my movie. This is your show. It's not a Frank Darabont [show]. This is your show. I just want to come and do a really good job, an incredible job, of directing what you want. Once you actually remove all the other stuff from — that weight from your shoulders of having to be the authority of the show, it actually winds up being kind of a fun job. I loved it.

I was reviewing a lot of your work leading up to this interview, and you have this really masterful control of the camera, and I imagine a lot of that is going on behind the scenes as well. Given that it sounds like you really kind of let go for “Stranger Things,” is that something you wish maybe you had done earlier in your career? Or is it something you're interested in doing going forward?
 










I actually was in that situation some years ago, because there was— oh, gosh, I can't remember exactly what year this was. You could probably look it up. [Note: It was 2007.] But Shawn Ryan heard that I was a big fan of “The Shield.” His casting director, Deb Aquila, was my casting director on “Shawshank” and on a whole lot of things, and she had mentioned how much I love the show, so I was invited to direct an episode of “The Shield” as well, and that was a total shift of style, of approach. They had such brilliant camera operators. Billy Gerhardt and Richard Cantu and fantastic cinematographers, Rohn Schmidt, and it was all improvised camera work, all handheld, very documentary style. The approach was the polar opposite of everything I had done to that point. And that was very liberating. It just gave me another set of tools [in the] toolbox.

So coming to “Stranger Things,” I was so familiar with the show, I watched all four seasons with my wife. I think we'd seen those four seasons about four or five times before this invitation arrived to come direct, because we just loved it so much. We just kept watching it. I felt like I was pretty familiar with the style. Plus, of course, you have a tremendous asset and resource in the Duffers themselves, who were open to having me ask them a lot of questions about what they wanted and how they wanted it done. And a tremendous resource in the crew that you're working with, which, by the way, was absolutely superb. What a crew. My goodness, I could go on and on about the camera operators and the grip and the lighting, the electricians, even the costuming. I mean, every department was AAA. A lot of them had been with the show for a while, some even from the start, like Amy [Parris], the costume maven there, she'd been with them from Season 1.

 










I had so many people that I could rely on to help guide the process. I had a great DP and a great AD, and those are the two positions that you're most collaborating with on a daily basis. And I was a little bit nervous, because usually, as a director, you're picking those people. I had them assigned to me. Happily, it turned out that I couldn't have picked better if I had picked. Brett Jutkiewicz and Lisa Rowe, my DP and my AD, were just amazing. Amazing colleagues, collaborators and whatever. There weren't any problems on the set that we couldn't figure out. It was a very smooth process and helped along by an amazing cast as well.

I'm going to ask you about some specifics in a second, but I'm really curious about watching “Stranger Things” four or five times.

Oh, it's excessive. It's absolutely excessive. Yeah, I know. There are occasionally those shows where you just— and they are occasional. There's a reason “Stranger Things” is the success that it is because people are just hooked in it. There's so many things to discover on a repeat viewing, along the way. Yeah, we were just kind of obsessed fans.

Your work is often characterized by whether people can find hope and connection in impossible places or fantastical circumstances. Is that what drew you to the show, or was it something else?
 










Well, that's a great strength of the show. It's a cornerstone of why it has such a devoted following. Because it really does have a moral compass. This thing, you have a found family — some actual family — this group of people have been brought together by these circumstances, and they are always trying to do the right thing. There's tremendous positivity in that group. There's tremendous loyalty. They will sacrifice for one another. And you don't see that kind of heart in a lot of our entertainment. There's a lot of dour… There's a lot of greed.

Basically, I can't watch another thing about some psycho killer. That's the positivity of it. It's very much as it is with tone, as it is with period, is very much a throwback to an earlier kind of storytelling. That's why people relate to it. To Steveen Spielberg's work and to Stephen King's work, because those storytellers always had a lot of heart and a lot of positivity in their stories, no matter how dire circumstances would get. You had those people wanting to do the right thing and being protective of one another. That's really the heart of the show, and that's why we loved it so much.

Last night, I rewatched “The Mist” and then immediately flipped over to rewatching “The Turnbow Trap,” and I was really struck by the leap in special effects. The special effects are really good in “The Mist,” the creatures are great. But then you open up on the scene of Hopper chopping open the wall on “Stranger Things.” For you, behind the scenes and from the technical perspective, what was that leap like? Coming into “Stranger Things,” what did you have to learn? What did you have to embrace?
 










Well, one of the great strengths of the show is the fact that Netflix has really supported it. They had real budgets to work with. Whereas on “The Mist,” we were kind of in the bargain basement end of things in terms of production. Not to disparage that, because I really loved working with those constraints, etc, and I thought that CafeFX did a great job for me. Really terrific. Doing stuff for much less than someplace else would have charged.

But going into this, I knew they were going to have ILM and Wētā doing their effects work. That gives you a real comfort zone. All you have to do is, thank god we had Sean Ames and Betsy [Paterson]… They were our liaisons with the effects houses, and they were always on the set. So again, great support for a director. And always turn to them and say, “OK, if we do it this way, is it going to give the effects people what they need?” Or “How do we adjust this to make it work better for that end of things?” And they would always give me a great answer, or at least a thumbs up and say, “Yeah, what you're doing is going to work fine.” I knew that the effects work would be world class, because if you got ILM and Wētā, they're going to be.

It was really, really great fun for me to see the episode aired, because I had seen only temp effects, at best. When I was doing my director's cut, I'd only really seen temp effects so to see the finished thing, all properly put together, and the little eyes dotted and T's crossed, was really thrilling. When the Demogorgon falls into the basement and all that stuff, it's like, wow. It's really, really cool. Of course, you're on the set with, say, Finn [Wolfhard], right? He's got this big thing. I'm sure this is how Ray Harryhausen had to do it back in the day. “Now, just pretend he's there and jab at him and take a swing.” And he's acting his heart out to thin air. And by the time the effects people do their magic, it looks fantastic.

 










I love it. I love that. I love pulling the rabbit out of the hat, no matter what scale that is. It's one of the things I love about filmmaking, as simple as an editing trick, or somebody walks into a building on some location somewhere, and then walks into a different door months later on a set and that simple cut makes it look like the same place. Even that has always tickled me about what we do. I really dig it.

My favorite scene in the first four episodes is Erica serving pie to the Turnbow family. And the reason I love that is it turns on so many dimes. It goes from comedy to horror to drama… So as a director, when you're crafting something like that, how do you make sure you're modulating it so it has the proper arc to the scene?

Oh, golly. Wow. I figured the comedy of it would speak for itself. I just wanted the characters to be, given the material, as real as they could be. And I knew I had a great little thing up my sleeve with the actor, who plays the dad, Mr. Turnbow [Gray Hawks], when he's starting to get a little woozy. I knew that one camera trick that we had where you put the camera on the actor and it looks really weird was gonna really help sell the whole thing.

You're just in there with a group of people trying to make it as consistent in tone as possible. That's really the thing. And I knew that was going to be one of those scenes where the tone swings for the fences a little bit. I remember asking the Duffers during one of our me asking questions sessions, “okay, do you actually really want to see the needle going into the neck? Do you really want Erica to actually do that? Or can we suggest it more?” And they said, “No, no, go for it. Go for it. Just absolutely don't think twice. Just make it as shocking as you can.” I went, “OK, here we go.”

 










And by the way, that young actress [Caroline Elle Abrams], she gave me the best 1980s horror movie scream. I was so delighted with her scream. I actually had to shorten it a little bit in the cut, she really stretched it out. But she really sold that moment, that beat for us.

Of all the characters on the show, Henry Creel, in a weird way — I know you don't deal with him too much in the third episode — seems right in your wheelhouse. Do you see any connection between him and, say, Percy from “The Green Mile,” or Mother Carmody from “The Mist”? Do you have any sympathy for him? Those characters always have this essential human flaw that makes you think, if they just tweaked it a little bit, maybe they'd be a little bit better.

Yeah, Henry's really interesting. He's not even a sociopath anymore. He's gone into some other realm of crazy. I'm not going to give away anything, but I did get to work with that wonderful actor, Jamie [Campbell Bower], more in the fifth episode, which was a real treat for me. We do explore him a bit more in the second half, and he's really so driven by this morbid level of hatred for the world, that is what drives him, with Jamie, who's such an accomplished actor, playing against that almost. We saw it in the third episode. This sort of gentle approach that he's used, but it's so creepy and calculating… This gentle, friendly thing. It was a brilliant stroke on the Duffers' part, on the writers part, to approach him from that direction, and surprise the audience, surprise the characters in the show as well.

 










About a year ago, when the gig was first announced, you said you missed working with creative people, but weren't sure about returning to directing again beyond “Stranger Things.” Has that changed at all now that you've seen the reception to, at least the first episode?

You know, I actually love being retired. I grow roses. They look great. I'm trying to get better at doing watercolors, and I'm trying to learn the guitar, which I kind of suck at still, but I'm trying… My Hollywood years were like nine years of trying and then followed by almost 30 years of doing and those years went by in such a blur, I am a bit reluctant. But then again, on the other hand, when you have a great experience like I had, on “Stranger Things” with that cast, with that crew, it does kind of make you wonder if you want to get back in the saddle again.

But it would have to be… Well, let me put it this way. My best experience directing was for Castle Rock because they were just such a filmmaker-friendly place. They really supported you instead of fought you. If they made a suggestion, it wasn't with a baseball bat in their hands ready to beat you over the head. It was just a suggestion that you could take or leave. If every place was like that, then life would be better. I had a great experience working for Michael Wright at TNT, for “Mob City.” It was the closest thing I'd felt to my Castle Rock days.

 










I just don't want to fight any battles, and I don't want to have a lack of goodwill at the top, because that lack of goodwill rolls downhill. And so if it's a friendly place where they're going to trust the filmmaker, yeah, I'd certainly consider it. I'm too old to fight any battles anymore. I'm too old to get swept out with the trash at their convenience.

This is almost the opposite of what you're saying, but rewatching “The Mist,” I had forgotten it opens with that painting of Roland from “The Dark Tower.” I know you were turned down by Stephen King way back in the day for it, but I feel like you have to have a take for “The Dark Tower” somewhere.

Actually, I can correct that: I actually turned Steve down. He called me once, and it's not the only time he ever called me, but he called me once and asked me if I was interested in taking on “The Dark Tower.” I was very flattered and very honored that he asked me. But man, so much of that story is so internalized. It's so in the heads of the characters, and it's this massive, endless story as well. I thought, oh my god, this could be the next 10 years of my life and miss the mark, because it is a diabolically difficult thing to adapt. And at that point, I was just exhausted anyway. 

 










And I said, “Steve, I love you… Thank you for asking, but I gotta not do this.” I would have frozen in place if I had. He was very, very kind about that and then moved on with it. A couple of years later, when we were having a conversation, I said, “So wait, what's going on with ‘The Dark Tower'? I don't know, I might reconsider that.” He said, “Oh, no, it's with somebody else by now.” So you know, that may be where the he turned me down thing comes from. 

You know, who knows? These were just honestly idle conversations that occur on occasion between me and Steve King, one of the world's greatest people. I really owe him so much. You can imagine, my whole directing career, I owe to Steve King.

I saw another interview where you said there was an Easter egg to some of your earlier work in the episode. And I kept an eye out, but I feel like I missed it. I was looking if there was, like, a clip from “The Woman in the Room,” or “Nightmare on Elm Street 3” or something.

Yeah, the Easter egg actually is in Episode 5. And when you see it, you'll — believe me — you'll know it. It is one of my early gigs, and it was something wonderfully suggested by the Duffer brothers, who were big fans of that particular film. It's fun, and it gave me a little opportunity to honor another friend of mine from way back in the day, we worked together. So you'll see it. When you see it, you'll know.

In January, New York's IFC Center will host a timely new retrospective, “Panahi & Kiarostami: Two Masters,” as IndieWire announces exclusively. Running from January 2–8, 2026, the 18-film program will celebrate the interconnected work of acclaimed Iranian filmmakers Jafar Panahi and Abbas Kiarostami. 

The retrospective comes amid a surge for Panahi, following the release of his recent feature “It Was Just an Accident,” which has just been shortlisted for a Best International Feature Oscar. After decades of crafting subversively political films that have made him an enemy of the Iranian government, Panahi won this year's Palme d'Or for his dark-comedy-laced thriller about a group of former detainees debating the fate of the man they believe to be their prison tormentor. And while the award and the many accolades that followed contributed to Panahi once again being targeted by his country's regime, it also brought renewed attention to his stunning body of work — including his directorial debut, 1995's “The White Balloon,” which was written by Kiarostami.

The mini-festival, conceptualized and programmed by the critic Godfrey Cheshire, offers New York audiences a chance to experience that body of work, alongside Kiarostami's influential films, on the big screen. 

 










“Jafar Panahi, who for 17 years has been imprisoned and harassed by the Iranian government, and prevented from seeing his films with any audience, is now one of the world's preeminent filmmakers and seems headed for Oscar nominations,” Cheshire said in a statement. “In spite of all the attention given to ‘It Was Just an Accident,' many audiences don't know how long and distinguished his career has been. Our festival ‘Panahi & Kiarostami: Two Masters' is meant to rectify that by presenting nine of his previous features, including such masterworks as ‘The White Balloon,' ‘This Is Not a Film,' and ‘No Bears' … alongside nine features by his mentor, the great Abbas Kiarostami.” 

Among the Kiarostami titles featured in the program are “Through the Olive Trees” — which will be accompanied by a Q&A with Panahi, who served as an assistant on the film — and the Palme d'Or-winning “Taste of Cherry.” The full list of films featured in “Panahi & Kiarostami: Two Masters” is below.

Steven Drozd—the Flaming Lips' longtime guitarist, multi-instrumentalist, and primary songwriter alongside Wayne Coyne—is no longer in the band, according to a since-deleted post Drozd made online. When replying to a fan on Threads who asked if he was “officially done with the FLips,” the musician replied, “They're done with me – but we're not talking about it. So yes I'm moving on. Just keep it to yourself for now. OK?”

Pitchfork has reached out to a representative of the Flaming Lips for comment.

Drozd joined the Flaming Lips in 1991 and has been a key member of the experimental psych-rock group ever since. Although he and Coyne have formed several side projects together in the past, Drozd has never parted ways with or taken a break from the band in those 34 years.

As Consequence points out, fans started speculating about Drozd's status in the Flaming Lips several months ago when they noticed he was absent from their concerts. During the band's recent string of shows, AJ Slaughter was covering Drozd's parts in his place.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","YouTube Ditches the Billboard Charts","https://pitchfork.com/news/youtube-streams-will-no-longer-count-towards-billboard-charts/","Thu, 18 Dec 2025 14:21:58 GMT","

Songs streamed on YouTube will no longer count towards the Billboard charts, the platform announced in a blog yesterday (December 17). The change will take effect on January 16, 2026, according to Lyor Cohen, YouTube's global head of music. Cohen blamed a long-running dispute over Billboard's decision to weight subscriber streams more favorably than ad-supported streams in its chart tallies.

YouTube is threatening to pull its data despite a recent rule change that suggests a compromise on the issue: This week, Billboard announced it would more generously weight ad-supported, on-demand streams in comparison to their subscriber counterparts. That shift equates a stream by a YouTube or Spotify subscriber to two and a half streams by a non-subscriber. Before that, the ratio was 3:1, meaning a free stream was worth even less. But Cohen maintains this an “outdated formula” that “ignores the massive engagement from fans who don't have a subscription.” He notes that streaming makes up 84 percent of U.S. recorded music revenue and suggests that YouTube was pursuing a 1:1 ratio in streaming counts.

Why YouTube is so determined to bump up free streams is not entirely clear. Cohen argues that artists' work on fan-engagement on the platform is “being undervalued” by Billboard, hinting he believes a more generous chart contribution would drive activity on the platform. Also unclear is whether the disagreement pertains only to the ratio of subscriber to non-subscriber streams, or whether YouTube also disputes what Billboard counts as an on-demand stream. On YouTube, as on Spotify, some autoplays that follow an active song selection may be excluded from chart tallies. Pitchfork has emailed representatives for YouTube for further comment.

A Billboard spokesperson said in a statement, “There are so many ways a fan can support an artist they love, and each has a specific place in the music ecosystem. Billboard strives to measure that activity appropriately; balanced by various factors including consumer access, revenue analysis, data validation and industry guidance. It is our hope that YouTube reconsiders and joins Billboard in recognizing the reach and popularity of artists on all music platforms and in celebrating their achievements though the power of fans and how they interact with the music that they love.”

In September of last year, Jane's Addiction frontman Perry Farrell attacked guitarist Dave Navarro onstage during a concert in Boston. The band cut short the show and cancelled the remaining dates of a planned reunion tour of North America. At the time, Farrell issued an apology and all four members said they “had made the difficult decision to take some time away as a group.” Now, he and Jane's Addiction have shared additional statements addressing the incident and confirming his departure from the band. Read both in full below.

“Jane's Addiction has been at the center of my life for decades,” Farrell wrote in a joint Instagram post with the band. “The band, the songs, the patrons and the impact that we've had on music and culture mean more to me than any words I could ever possibly write down. My aim has always been to give our audience the best possible show, something real, honest and positive. In Boston, we fell short of that, and I'm truly sorry to everyone who was impacted.”

In their own post, the remaining members of Jane's Addiction—Navarro, bassist Eric Avery, and drummer Stephen Perkins—shared, “we unilaterally determined it would be best to not continue the tour and made inaccurate statements about Perry's mental health which we regret.” They added, “We now look forward to the future as we embark on our separate musical and creative endeavors.”

Jane's Addiction's original lineup reunited in 2024 with a new song, “Imminent Redemption.” A second new song, “True Love,” arrived just a couple of days after the Boston incident. Earlier this year, Navarro, Avery, and Perkins sued Farrell, claiming a loss of $10 million in potential earnings from the cancelled reunion shows and a new album that was reportedly never completed. Farrell then countersued, alleging that his bandmates engaged in a “years-long bullying campaign” against him. Pitchfork has reached out for representatives for Jane's Addiction to confirm whether the suits will continue.

Revisit the Sunday Review of Jane's Addiction's 1988 album Nothing's Shocking.

Perry Farrell:

To everyone in Boston, and around the world.

I'd like to address what happened on stage last year. I've reflected on it and know I didn't handle myself the way I should have. I apologize to our patrons and my bandmates for losing my temper and for disrupting the show.

Jane's Addiction has been at the center of my life for decades.

The band, the songs, the patrons and the impact that we've had on music and culture mean more to me than any words I could ever possibly write down.

My aim has always been to give our audience the best possible show, something real, honest and positive. In Boston, we fell short of that, and I'm truly sorry to everyone who was impacted.

From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank each and every one of you for your continued love and support.

Jane's Addiction:

We would like to clarify the events surrounding the cancellation of the tour after the show in Boston in September 2024.

After that show, without notice to Perry, we unilaterally determined it would be best to not continue the tour and made inaccurate statements about Perry's mental health which we regret.

Today we are here to announce that we have come together one last time to resolve our differences, so that the legacy of Jane's Addiction will remain the work the four of us created together.

We now look forward to the future as we embark on our separate musical and creative endeavors. Jane's Addiction will forever live in our hearts. We are proud of the music we created together.

You, the fans, are our lifeblood, and we will always appreciate you.

	Kristin Cabot, whose liaison with her boss at a Coldplay concert this summer went viral and cost both of them their jobs, has broken her silence in a New York Times profile, detailing how she's living in the aftermath of public shaming. “I was so embarrassed and so horrified,” she said. “I'm the head of H.R. and he's the C.E.O. It's, like, so cliché and so bad.” But as she explained, the fallout was much worse after public shaming led to doxxing, which in turn led to 500 to 600 calls a day and what she estimated as 50 to 60 death threats.


	Cabot, 53, maintained in the article that she was not in a relationship with her boss, former Astronomer CEO Andy Byron, before the concert, and that the first time they kissed was the one captured on Gillette Stadium's jumbotron. “I made a bad decision and had a couple of High Noons and danced and acted inappropriately with my boss,” she said. “And it's not nothing. And I took accountability and I gave up my career for that. That's the price I chose to pay. I want my kids to know that you can make mistakes, and you can really screw up. But you don't have to be threatened to be killed for them.”

	











	She also shared her side of the story, explaining that she started at Astronomer in November 2024 and bonded with Byron over their shared separations from their spouses. Feeling a spark, she invited him to a Coldplay concert with her friends. “I was like: ‘I got this. I can have a crush. I can handle it,” she told the Times. On the way there, she learned her husband, also an Andrew, would be in the audience. Nevertheless, she said, she went with the moment and pulled Byron's arms around her for a kiss right as the camera hit her.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Aware that the camera was on them, when they instantly recoiled, Chris Martin commented, “Either they're having an affair, or they're just very shy.” Cabot told the Times that she and Byron ran to the bar in shame. “We both just sat there with our heads in our hands, like, ‘What just happened?'” she recalled, adding that their first impulse was to tell Astronomer's board of directors what happened. After she received a TikTok at 4 a.m. showing her kiss, she drove to Boston the next day to see her husband and tell her kids what happened.

	Byron resigned from the company a few days after the concert. After the Astronomer's board investigated what happened, they offered Cabot the opportunity to keep her job, but she decided to resign instead, later in July. She tried to disappear by herself for self-healing, but the public shaming was fast and furious, and she began fearing for her and her children's safety when people commented on her daily routines. She told the Times, though, that she wants to own her actions and hopes that people understand and respect her privacy.


	Byron, Cabot's ex-husband, and reps for Astronomer all declined to comment.


	The harshest critics, she told the Times, were women. And she added that she was especially disappointed in Gwyneth Paltrow, who starred in a cheeky ad for Astronomer, since Paltrow had pioneered the phrase “conscious uncoupling” and had created a company supportive of women.

	Cabot's and Byron's jumbotron kiss became one of the year's most prolific memes, with one person on social media commenting, “Shoutout to Coldplay for bringing the whole internet together for one day.”


	After the incident, Martin made it a point to inform audiences that they could be caught on camera during what he dubbed “The Jumbotron Song.” “We'd like to say hello to some of you in the crowd,” he said in July at the Madison, Wisconsin gig after Cabot's viral moment. “How we're gonna do that is we're gonna use our cameras and put some of you on the big screen. So please, if you haven't done your makeup, do your makeup now.”

L
et me tell you about Melissa Hortman.


	It's the early 2000s. She and her husband, Mark, tell their kids they are driving from their Minneapolis home to Michigan on a camping trip. Sophie and Colin are stoked.


	Then Mom takes a detour. The Hortman family's 150,000-miles-plus minivan finds itself at the gates of a Michigan recycling plant. You see, Michigan has a 10-cent bottle-return law that Hortman thinks might work for Minnesota.


	“This will be fun,” Hortman tells her kids.


	They stay for three hours.


	Let me tell you about Melissa Hortman.


	Her favorite book is The Little Prince, the story of a pilot who befriends a six-year-old prince from a faraway asteroid. There's a line in the book where a magical fox tells the little prince the secret to life:


“It is only with the heart that one can see rightly.What is essential is invisible to the eye.”


	Let me tell you about Melissa Hortman. It is the summer of 2024. Hortman is now the speaker of the Minnesota House. She has just been instrumental in passing the Minnesota Miracle, a “holy shit” 30-point piece of legislation that protects and offers a hand up to the state's neediest citizens. Now, she is at a retreat along with the other members of her Democratic Farmer Labor caucus. There is much to celebrate, perhaps too much. A legislator knocks back one too many of Hortman's Patron Silver margaritas. The next morning, he is, let us say, unwell. She knocks on his hotel door and leaves him some Advil.

	











	“You just stay here as long as you need,” says Hortman before closing the door.

	











	Let me tell you about Melissa Hortman. She encourages others, but she is not going to the June No Kings rally: “Not a protesty girl.” That's true; she is a policy nerd.


	She owns every issue of Chocolatier Magazine. Hortman issues her two kids credit cards when they leave for college, to be used only in emergencies and for chocolate. On television, she loves The Great British Bake Off, nothing too deep. There's already enough anger and sorrow in the actual world.

	Let me tell you about Melissa Hortman. She arrives at caucus meetings, her blond hair still wet, and, well, always a little late. Under her arm is a policy binder and an oversize purse. Hortman gains solace from her Catholic faith, something she doesn't talk about very much but has embraced since her days as a Sunday-school helper at the Church of Saint Timothy in her hometown of Blaine. Deep in the recesses of said purse is a bent and folded copy of the prayer of St. Francis of Assisi:


Lord, make me an instrument of your peace:Where there is hatred, let me sow love;Where there is injury, pardon;Where there is doubt, faith;Where there is despair, hope.


	Let me tell you one last thing about Melissa Hortman. Sometimes, she feels — no, she knows — politics is pushing her away from St. Francis' words.


	She hates it.


	In the early hours of June 14, 2025, Melissa Hortman, her husband, Mark, and their dog, Gilbert, are murdered in their Brooklyn Park home. The killer is dressed as a cop and carries a death list of Minnesota Democratic lawmakers. (State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife are also shot. They both recover.)

	The Hortmans lie in state a week later in the Minnesota Capitol rotunda, along with Gilbert. On June 28, a funeral mass is held at Basilica of St. Mary in downtown Minneapolis. Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and thousands of Minnesotans mourn together. Gov. Tim Walz gives a eulogy; so does Melissa's best friend, Robin Ann Williams. They weep for all she accomplished, and they weep for what could have been: Colin's December wedding, more Sophie brunches, and, maybe, becoming Minnesota's next governor.


	Political violence haunts our history, a black car idling outside a diner while folks talk to reporters about American exceptionalism over bacon and eggs. It is a patient virus, waiting for chaos and confusion, and then finding a new victim. It metastasizes slowly and then explodes. Lincoln and his cabinet after Appomattox. A century later, JFK, RFK, and MLK fall, creating so much terror that everyone understands what Mick Jagger is singing about:

	











I shouted out, “Who killed the Kennedys?”When after all, it was you and me.


	Here we are again. Hortman's murder was preceded by two attempts on Donald Trump's life, a botched murder plot against Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and the fire-bombing of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's home. It is followed by the Charlie Kirk assassination three months later.


	The murder of innocents has always been a historical fact, whether committed by Sudanese warlords or American drones. These days, we doomscroll to the next atrocity, our outrage for the anonymous dead anesthetized like an alcoholic who feels nothing after downing a pint of gin.


	The pain only lingers when it is someone we know or someone we think we know from TV or Instagram. I can tell you that Melissa Hortman would be pissed off if her murder meant more to you than, say, the killing of a homeless vet in downtown Minneapolis. But the dead don't get to make that call. The June massacre of 10 students by a suicidal gunman packing a Glock and a sawed-off shotgun in Graz, Austria, did not crush me. No, it was the murder of Melissa Hortman — a woman I met once — that dropped me to the carpet in my Los Angeles hotel room.


	This is not a true-crime story. I am sure there is a podcast in the works, if that's your thing. And this is not a story about Utah Sen. Mike Lee posting tweets after Melissa Hortman's murder reading, “This is what happens when Marxists don't get their way,” and another one quipping, “Nightmare on Waltz street.” And this is not a story about late-night Fox News Gollum Greg Gutfeld suggesting Hortman knew her killer. (She did not.) And it is definitely not about Trump professing not to know who she was two months after her death and then insisting he would have flown flags at half-staff for Hortman if only Walz wasn't such a jerk.


	None of that is important. Williams, Hortman's best friend, tells me she doesn't even know the name of Melissa and Mark Hortman's killer. “It does not matter how Melissa died,” Williams says in a whisper. “All that really matters is how she lived.”


	This is what I know. It is October 2024, and I am in Minneapolis covering Walz's vice presidential campaign. One of Walz's calling cards is 2023's Minnesota Miracle, a dizzying array of social safety-net legislation that he and the state legislature passed. His staffers urge me to talk with someone named Melissa Hortman, who they claim is the true architect of the policies.

	











	I drive to a St. Paul coffee shop near the state Capitol. I am having a bad day; I have fucked up my neck and shoulder, but with the tumult of the presidential campaign, I've not made it to a doctor. I am in excruciating pain and even more addled than usual as I slide into a chair across from her. She senses something is amiss and gives me some grace.


	“Take your time, get settled, I'm not going anywhere.”


	This may seem like nothing, but I've been doing this a while. It is definitely something.


	She then speaks frankly about Walz and how they share a belief in spending political capital, not hoarding it, and the George Floyd protests, to a degree that her press aide's eyebrows shoot up like a surprised cartoon character. Later, I learn this is classic Hortman. We say goodbye and share misplaced optimism about Election Day, a week away.

Political violence is a patient virus, waiting for chaos, then finding a new victim.


	This story is written in the present tense. Why? Not one of the dozens of family, friends, and colleagues I interviewed can bear to refer to Hortman in the past tense. Maybe it is a coping mechanism, or maybe it is a belief that her achievements are a living, breathing thing.


	What is essential is invisible to the eye.


	So, let me tell you a little more about Melissa Hortman.


	A brother and sister scramble through John's Auto Parts in Blaine, Minnesota. They open the doors of Novas and Pontiacs before they are pulverized, looking for change or other treasures. The older boy is Patrick, an incorrigible lad who sometimes arrives home with only one shoe, is allergic to most foods, and will right himself in time to graduate from MIT at the age of 20. Right behind him is his sensible sister. She is born Melissa but goes by Missy because she has a speech impediment and can't get all the letters out.


	Somewhere on the lot are their parents, Harold and Linda Haluptzok. They met at Der Lach Haus, Linda's dad Muzzy's supper club. Harold was the head busboy, and Linda worked coat check. They fell in love in high school and had their kids in 1969 and 1970 while they both were students at the University of Minnesota. Sixty years later, they are still holding hands. “When I dream, I still dream about her, not other women, which is nice,” says Harold of his wife.


	This is not your regular boneyard. Early in the 1970s, the Environmental Protection Agency sends Harold a notice with a heavy fine, claiming oil and tire residue has soaked into the ground and their property is going to become one of the agency's first cleanup sites. The notice turns the Haluptzoks into accidental environmentalists. They negotiate an extension and clean up their property.


	Both Linda and Harold self-identify as type A personalities, so it doesn't stop there. He writes a book on how to run an environmentally safe junkyard. Eventually, the couple own five salvage yards and travel around the world giving speeches on how to crush cars and remain on speaking terms with Mother Earth.

	











	Missy notices it all and has questions.


	“How do you keep the oil safe? How does a business work? What is global warming?”


	Her parents try explaining, but mostly they just let her watch. At 10, she is obsessed with the 1980 presidential election. She tells her mom something very important: “I am going to be the first female president.”


	Melissa wants to go to Harvard. “Kids from Blaine don't go to Harvard,” explains her counselor. She applies anyway. She doesn't get in. She goes to Boston University. Four years later, she graduates with honors and applies to Harvard Law School. No dice. Instead, she returns home and goes to the University of Minnesota Law School. Decades later, she applies to the Harvard Graduate School of Public Policy. She gets in and earns her master's.


	Melissa Haluptzok is a persistent woman. And Mark Hortman is a persistent man. It is the summer of 1992. Melissa is working in Sen. John Kerry's office. She goes to the D.C. office of the Big Brothers Big Sisters of America program and fills out an application to mentor a kid in need. A young man watches her. He times turning in his own application to coincide with hers.


	Mark is from North Carolina, his Southern roots stretching back for more than a century. Still, he makes it clear to Melissa on one of their first dates that he does not fear the cold. He visits the Haluptzoks during an October blizzard and traipses around the frozen tundra in just a light jacket.


	Mark says no to his parents' offer to set him up in the family's thriving printing business. He and Melissa are engaged three months after they start dating. They marry and settle in Brooklyn Park, about 15 minutes from where she grew up. They seem mismatched, but it works. Early in their marriage, at a Democratic Farm Labor district caucus meeting, Mark argues for the legalization of marijuana. (The DFL is the Minnesota version of the Democratic Party.) Melissa smiles, then stands up and argues against it.


	Mark works in the tech world, and on the side invents a robot to make his morning oats and, years later, a weeding robot that can tell the difference between weeds and flowers. He builds his own speakers and talks about how much he loves the band Soul Coughing. Melissa rolls her eyes, dreams of policy conferences and being asleep by 8:30.


	The couple have Colin and Sophie quickly, just like Harold and Linda had Missy and Patrick. Melissa works for Central Minnesota Legal Services as a housing lawyer and represents Stormy Harmon, a mother of three left homeless after her landlord refused to fix her furnace. Hortman proves the landlord has a persistent pattern of making racist threats and harassing Harmon's children. Despite the landlord maintaining his innocence, Hortman wins Harmon the largest jury award for a single family's race-based housing-discrimination claim in state history to date.

	











	Enough already, that's what Melissa Hortman would say at this point: “Why do we gotta do all this tomfoolery, this turkey dance? Why am I doing all this bullshit? Let's just do the thing right now.”


	OK, let's do the thing.


	It doesn't come easy. Hortman runs for state representative but loses in both 1998 and 2002. Part of it is demographics — her Brooklyn Park district is traditional suburban GOP — and part of it is Hortman's honesty. She knocks on hundreds of doors, and when a mom says she is against something, say, gay marriage, Hortman doesn't dance around it, she locks eyes and tells the mom gay marriage is simply about equality for everyone. In 2004, she squeezes past the incumbent by 400 votes.


	The universal rule for freshmen reps is sit down, shut up, and let seniority get things done. Hortman doesn't really abide by that. In her first term, Minnesota is bogged down in a budget deadlock. Hortman and a group of ad hoc legislators from both parties meet and brainstorm ideas that they pass on to House leaders. The ideas help break the logjam, and the budget passes.

At 10, she tells her mom something very important: “I am going to be the first female president.”


	Hortman also spends her early years being her father's daughter, contemplating how to make environmental reforms that also make good business sense, while making friends with colleagues. She is elected assistant majority leader in her second term. In 2013, Hortman becomes chair of the House Energy Policy Committee. Fortuitously, the Minnesota DFL has a rare trifecta that year, control of both legislative bodies and the governor's mansion. She sees her chance and grinds down her caucus with facts and figures about how Minnesota going solar — even in a small way — is financially smart and environmentally friendly. In the end, she pushes through a bill that provides tax breaks to businesses using solar energy and mandates that Minnesota utilities obtain 1.5 percent of their electricity from solar by 2020.


	How proud is she? Go look up her X bio. It cites only one achievement: Author of MN's solar standard and community solar law.


	Two years later, she attends the Paris Climate Conference. She smiles as international legislators ask her in multiple languages how they can craft a similar bill. Party leaders approach her about running for Congress. She talks to Mark and the kids about it. They tell her to go for it. But then she walks through the house and sees the photos on the fridge and the kids' gym bags ready for their next swim meet. She loves sitting in the stands and serving as the team's timer. And then she thinks of Minnesota winters and imagines getting stuck in Washington, D.C., because a snowbound Minneapolis-St. Paul airport is closed. She says thanks but no thanks.

	











	She keeps moving up the ladder in the House. By 2017, Hortman is minority leader. That April, there's a debate in the House on a bill that would increase the criminal penalties for civil protests that block roads and highways. Minnesota is 20 percent minority, but there are 16 representatives of color at the time. Many speak against the bill. Rena Moran speaks of how her great-great grandmother was a slave and how her family's progress can be marked by their freedom to protest injustice.


	Hortman listens and gets angry. Few representatives are in their seats. Many of them are in the House lounge playing poker.


	“I hate to break up the 100 percent white-male card game, but I think this is an important debate,” Hortman says.


	One of those hearing her remarks is Rep. Moran. “She sees us, she hears us,” thinks Moran.


	Hortman's remarks incense Minnesota House Republicans.


	“Minority Leader, would you apologize to the body?”


	She will not.


	“I have no intention of apologizing,” says Hortman. “I am so tired of watching Rep. Susan Allen give an amazing speech, Rep. Peggy Flanagan give an amazing speech, watching Rep. Jamie Becker Finn give an amazing speech, Rep. Rena Moran give the most heartfelt, incredible speech I've heard on this House floor as long as I can remember, watching Rep. Ilhan Omar give an amazing speech, and looking around, to see, ‘Where are my colleagues?' … And I'm really tired of watching women of color, in particular, being ignored. So, I'm not sorry.”


	The 2018 election is just around the corner, and Hortman knows that calling bullshit on the Republicans is not enough. It didn't work in 2016 when she expected a state House majority and a female president.


	“We said to ourselves, ‘The electorate is not buying what we're selling,'” Hortman tells me last year. “So, we need to go talk to the electorate, to people who are not involved and not activists, to get the real feel.”


	Hortman and other DFL leaders launch a listening tour called the Minnesota Values Plan. “They want really great public schools,” Hortman tells me. “They want health care that's more affordable and accessible, so they get it when they need it. They want an economy that works for everyone.”

	











	Leaving nothing to chance, Hortman recruits candidates and stresses that ads and yard signs do not matter, you must go door to door. It becomes her obsession, and she personally door-knocks in every contested district.


	Meanwhile, Tim Walz is running for governor under a premise similar to Minnesota Values, called One Minnesota. Walz wins and the DFL takes the House. Hortman beams when she is handed the speaker's gavel.


	Hortman and Walz are simpatico, but she makes it clear to the governor her House is not to be trifled with. Strike that, Hortman has a creatively profane streak. She basically says, “Don't fuck with us.”


	Here's an example. During a testy policy debate, an angry Walz tells the press corps that the House is acting like spoiled children. Within minutes, Hortman gets Walz on the phone and he receives a slap-down.


	“You need to be specific who you are talking about, not group us all together,” Hortman tells Waltz.


	“Ms. Speaker, I apologize. I should have been more specific,” Walz says.


	Walz issues a public apology the same day.

“There was a simmering rage that did not stop,” Hortman Said after the 2022 election.


	On May 25, 2020, a white Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, kills George Floyd, a Black man, by placing him in a chokehold and slamming his knee onto his windpipe. Floyd gasps and calls for his mother before he suffocates to death.


	The city erupts into fiery protests with stores burned out and police stations set afire. During the worst nights, Hortman and her deputies maintain a phone line where reps can report violence in their districts, and she routes the calls directly to the state emergency-operations center. At her urging, the governor calls a special session of the legislature to deal with police reform.


	One of Hortman's first calls is to Moran. She knows that as one of the few members of color in the House it is essential that Moran lead the efforts to pass a police-reform bill that will have the greatest impact in inner-city districts like the one Moran represents. Moran has her doubts.


	“That is not what I do, I'm not even on the public-safety committee,” Moran says.


	“Doesn't matter,” Hortman says. “You're going to do it.”


	And Moran does it. In July, the House passes a police-reform law that somehow passes the Republican-controlled Senate and is signed into law by Walz. The bill prohibits chokeholds like the one that killed Floyd and creates an independent body to investigate police officers accused of sexual assault or killing a civilian. The bill also prohibits police departments from offering overly aggressive “warrior-style training.” Walz lavishes Hortman with praise for keeping the bill moving forward, but Hortman redirects the adulation to Moran.

	











	“She really has the skill to see what you are capable of doing, even when you didn't think you could do it,” Moran says. “I will never forget that.”


	Melissa Hortman doesn't mind when other legislators call her the caucus mom. It's true. She's a suburban mother in an electric car who arrives home, kicks off her sensible shoes, and puts on her cozy slippers. She takes fashion tips from her hip daughter, Sophie. And, yeah, she is so coffee-addicted that she moves the coffee maker into the marital bathroom. And sure, sometimes reps beg for 15 minutes of her time and she seems somewhere else, worrying about her kids. She's a mom, and she will not apologize.


	That normalcy makes the fact that in 2023 Minnesota House Speaker Hortman passes the most sweeping social legislation in Minnesota history — think of a Gopher State New Deal — all the more remarkable.


	Go to the state House and see it for yourself. Hortman's greatest achievement hangs on the wall in the Minnesota State Capitol Building. “Top Bills for 2023 Session” read two poster boards, each with 15 policy goals, 30 in total. All 30 have check marks indicating “passed” and “enacted.”


	It all starts with the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022. Minnesota borders North Dakota and South Dakota in the west, ardently red states that quickly move to make abortion a felony. Suddenly, Minnesota is on the frontier of the pro-choice movement.


	“There was a simmering rage that did not stop,” Hortman tells the press after the 2022 election.


	Women voters turn out, and the DFL retains the House and the governor's mansion. Early that morning, it becomes clear they would also have a majority in the state Senate, a rare trifecta in the purplish state. At that moment, Hortman remembers a political cartoon that stuck with her.


	“It was around the time that Barack Obama got elected and had a federal trifecta,” Hortman tells me over our coffee. “There was a political cartoon of a donkey cowering behind the light coming through a doorway, and it said, ‘Don't just stand there. Do something.'”


	That's not going to be Hortman.


	“Let's fucking go,” she tells her caucus.

	











	Free hot lunch for all Minnesota students is a priority for Walz, and she knows if they wait until May or June of 2023, when the budget is usually passed, it will delay the lunches for another school year. So, she pushes a stand-alone bill in February, and the hot lunches are served the following September. Then she gets to work on the rest. A few legislators ask if they can vote no on tough ones involving granting undocumented immigrants driver's licenses and access to the state public-health system. She talks them out of it. She tells them their opponents will attack them either way. Why not do the right thing?


	The 30-point policy passes through the House and Senate without a dissenting DFL vote. I ask her what kind of feedback the legislation was receiving on the campaign trail just 10 days before the 2024 election.


	“People don't elect us to go to the Capitol and twiddle our fingers,” Hortman tells me. She has a Cheshire cat's smile and wise eyes. “What we heard from the electorate in 2022 is they were very happy and that, ‘Oh, finally, my government did something!'”


	I prod a bit about whether the changes might seem too drastic for a nearly 50-50 state like Minnesota. She shakes her head no.


	“Ask the average person in Minnesota, ‘Do you want to be able to take time off if you get cancer and still have a job?' Or ask the average Minnesotan, ‘If a family has a child who is transgender, should they be able to get the health care that they feel that they need for their child? ”


	Hortman thrusts her hands, palms upward.


	“It's basic human decency.”


	Let's talk about Hortman's real house. Her home is everything. This is where she and Mark raise their kids. It has everything she needs and is only 30 minutes from her mom and dad and their pool in summertime.


	Here at 8710 Windsor Terrace — the address is prominently listed on her campaign website — it all starts with the kitchen. There's Mark making breakfast for Sophie every morning her senior year because he knows his dad days are running short and worries she might be lonely now that Colin is away at college.


	There's Melissa baking cakes and mixing margaritas. And there's the deck with the grill overlooking the Edinburgh Golf Course where the Hortmans hang with their best friends Robin and her husband, Paul Filiatrault, drinking cocktails and talking about Mark's progress on building a weeding robot for Melissa, one that could discern between dandelions and his wife's beloved delphiniums.


	Melissa's garden is her favorite place. She spends hours there in a sun hat, pruning and watering with AirPods in as she burns through calls to her more long-winded caucus members. On Saturdays, she calls Sophie and asks her to meet her at Bachman's Garden Center. Sophie grumpily texts back: “Mom, I'm still sleeping. Let's meet for brunch later.”


	Undeterred, Melissa goes it alone, picking out orchids because they attract butterflies, and she loves butterflies. Back in the garden, she calls state Rep. Brad Tabke, a landscaper by trade, to see if she is planting her lilacs correctly.

	











	Hortman's home is her sanctuary even in the winter. That's when she cross-country skis the golf course, only growling when she notices an inconsiderate snowshoer has fucked up the trail.


	Then, the sanctuary seems less secure. After George Floyd's death, protesters march outside the governor's mansion, and they march in front of 8710 Windsor Terrace. This is one of the few things in life that freaks out the legendarily unflappable Hortman.


	Colleagues tell her it will be fine; the protesters just want to be heard. Then Jan. 6 happens. Protesters try to break into the governor's mansion. Other Minnesota legislators have protesters outside their homes, walking the streets with rifles, taking advantage of the state's open-carry laws.

“People don't elect us to go to the capitol and twiddle our fingers,” Hortman tells me.


	Hortman is alone. Her kids are grown and out of the house, and Mark is down in Naples, Florida, where his father has just had triple-bypass surgery. She gets a call from the Minnesota State Police that there has been a credible threat against her safety, and it would be best if she could leave the metropolitan area for a few days. So, Hortman calls Colin and the two drive 200 miles north into Minnesota's Iron Range. They check into a lodge and the two have a great time, Colin snowboarding and his mom doing her cross-country thing. Mother and son head back home after a few days, the threat having dissipated.


	But Hortman is still scared. She calls state Rep. Ryan Winkler, her top deputy, and tells him she's done.


	“I can't do this. I think I need to quit. I need to walk away.”


	He tries to calm her.


	“Melissa, you're going to go check into a hotel. Get away from your house. Go someplace where nobody knows where you are.”

	











	She takes his advice and checks into a hotel. But it's not enough. A few days later, Hortman is on a conference call with her family. She makes an announcement: “I'm getting a dog.”


	The family loves dogs, but there is momentary silence as everyone tries to broach how she is going to manage a dog with her legislative schedule.


	“I need some work-life balance. Besides, I can get out of things early. I can just say I've got to go home and walk my dog.”


	Hortman calls Helping Paws foster home, where she once volunteered, and asks if they have a dog that needs a home. The next day, she meets Gilbert, a golden retriever who is a service dog in training. For years, Hortman has written her thoughts down in a journal, volumes filling a shelf in her closet. The subjects range from the kids to Mark to legislators on her “bad list.” Now, it's all about her new friend.


	3:36 a.m. Gilbert needed to potty4:00 a.m. Cuddled with Gilbert4:05 a.m. Try to get him back to sleep


	Winkler and other friends see the dark cloud over Hortman pass. Alas, Gilbert proves too irascible and silly to be a service dog.


	“I wouldn't mind if I ended up being Gilbert's human,” she tells friends.


	She gets her wish. Gilbert flunks out of the service-dog academy.


	All she has to do now is keep Gilbert out of her garden.


	Melissa Hortman wakes up to a different world on Nov. 6, 2024. There's the disappointment of the Harris-Walz defeat and Hortman's hold on the speakership is tenuous. The Minnesota State House is deadlocked at 67-67. The Republicans play hardball, suggesting they will unilaterally refuse to seat Hortman's friend Brad Tabke, because his race is close. This will give them a one-seat majority. Hortman offers them compromises, but when the GOP won't negotiate in good faith, she holds out her caucus, preventing the Republicans from having a quorum. The deadlock lasts three weeks. Hortman knows that to break the impasse, she must part with her greatest achievement. She offers the Republicans her speaker gavel if they will certify the election of the contested seat and consent to equal committee assignments.


	Her caucus begs her not to do it.


	“She wanted to do it from the beginning,” says Zack Stephenson, the House Democratic majority leader. “She didn't want her hanging onto the speakership to be the thing that held us up. It took the rest of us a bit of time to get over being mad about it, but she knows what needs to be done.”


	Hortman knows the move will protect her committee chairs and staffers' jobs, and that will help them save most of the policies they passed in 2023, including paid family and medical leave, abortion rights, affordable-housing investments, and millions for Minnesota's underfunded public schools.


	She also knows a budget must be passed by June 15 or the state government shuts down. Hortman tells about a government-worker acquaintance caught in a different shutdown, who took his own life, despairing about his bills. She isn't going to let that happen again.

	











	Hortman thinks she can protect everyone. This time she is wrong. The Trumpian rage against the undocumented is in full throat. Trump is unleashing Immigration and Customs Enforcement on the country, rounding up undocumented immigrants, often without the semblance of due process. Minnesota Republicans are doing their part and insisting that Minnesota stop providing health insurance to undocumented immigrants.


	Hortman offers them anything else — tax relief, budget cuts — but they will not back down. She scratches and claws and appeals to the Republicans' humanity, and they agree not to kick kids under 18 off the insurance.


	“It is only because of Melissa that the kids still have coverage,” Walz tells me.


	But Hortman knows that roughly 20,000 Minnesotans will suffer and some of them will die. Hortman meets with Walz and Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy. Walz cries. Murphy cries. And Hortman cries.


	“I hate this,” Hortman tells a friend. “This is not me, this is not why I am here.”

“I was kind of hoping you'd run,” Gov. Walz tells Hortman about his seat. She is flattered but unsure.


	Standing before an ornate fireplace in the governor's office, Walz, Hortman, and legislators from both parties announce they have reached a budget deal, avoiding a governmental shutdown. Walz admits that part of the compromise was ending insurance coverage for undocumented immigrants older than 18. Progressive members of Hortman's caucus are pissed. They bang on the conference room's heavy doors, interrupting Walz's remarks.


	Hortman does not blame them. She and Murphy, a nurse for 40 years, know it is all bullshit, red-meat optics, because the same undocumented are now going to show up in ERs, desperate with life-threatening and expensive problems that could have been stopped with preventive care.


	Hortman carries the weight alone. She insists that stripping undocumented immigrants of health care will be a stand-alone vote. She is the only Democrat to vote for the cut. She presses the green button at her legislative desk and votes yes. A little later, she talks about the vote with the Capitol press corps. Exhausted, in a dark-green business suit, Hortman cries again.


	“I did what leaders do. I stepped up and I got the job done for the people of Minnesota.”


	Hortman retreats to her office and sits at her desk, where Romans 14:19 is in a small frame.


	So, let's strive for the things that bring peace and the things that build each other up.

	











	She fidgets and texts Senate Majority Leader Murphy, who is still working out the in and outs of her side of the bill.


	“What's taking so long? I want to go home.”


	Someone remembers that Melissa hasn't eaten all day and places a food order for her. A friend texts later and asks how she is doing. She texts back.


	“I'm fine, eating now! Worried about my soul but real happy about this Panera order.”


	It is her last vote.


	Two days later, Melissa Hortman drives to meet Sophie for brunch at Fat Nat's, their usual spot. She sits down and tries to give her daughter some tough love.


	“You've overdrawn one of your accounts.”


	She then offers something between a grimace and a smile.


	“I'd be madder,” she says, “but I just noticed I'm overdrawn on my account, too.”


	They laugh, and Mom confides to her daughter that she is thinking of getting out of politics.


	“Maybe I could study and become a horticulturalist. Or just pull weeds.”


	Sophie listens and gives an understanding nod. She has heard this before at the end of a legislative session. They change the subject and talk of other things, Sophie's dating, upcoming pool days at Harold and Linda's, Colin's wedding, and Dad's robot weeder.


	They linger after the meal, but then it's time to go. They speak in unison.


	“I love you.”


	That Friday evening, Melissa and Mark head to the DFL's annual Humphrey-Mondale dinner with Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker giving the keynote address. She wears a business suit while Mark wears a paisley shirt and a maroon sports jacket. She finds these dinners a grind under the best of circumstances, but she is still fried from the session.


	Onstage, Walz gives her a shout-out.


	“I've had the pleasure of signing Melissa Hortman's legislation for six years,” Walz says.


	Everyone claps.


	Walz and Hortman have been talking throughout the session about something other than pending bills. Walz is coming to the end of his second term and confides to Hortman he's thinking of not running again in 2026. “I was kind of hoping you'd run,” Walz tells her.


	Hortman is flattered, but unsure. She is hellbent on taking back the legislature in 2026. There is already talk of new candidates and, yes, intense door-knocking. Besides, Hortman wonders, maybe she already is in the perfect spot, a place where she can make a difference without all of the, well, bullshit that goes with being governor. But now she just needs to sleep. It's cloudy that night in Minneapolis. It doesn't matter. Hortman knows tomorrow will be a good day to spend in her garden.

	











	Summer is here.


	The summer is fading by the time I fly to Minneapolis. It fights back occasionally with a day of brilliant sunshine bouncing off Lake Minnetonka, and then concedes to reality, and the rain falls sideways. It is not unlike the grief enveloping Melissa Hortman's loved ones.


	“I am in an OK place now,” Sophie Hortman tells me one afternoon at the Sociable Cider Werks in Minneapolis.


	She's a teacher but is taking a year off. She smiles as ABBA's “Knowing You, Knowing Me” plays. Her mom loves ABBA. She talks with her brother, Colin, every day. Colin works in information technology and is soft-spoken, and with his beard resembles the Southern gentlemen from his dad's side of the family.


	Recently, Sophie and Colin took Colin's old boat out and just floated around on Lake Minnewaska. They talked of their mom's love of butterflies. Then, magically, butterflies were flitting around the boat. They whispered to each other.


	“She's here.”


	Sophie smiles at the memory and then talks about how she and her mom would trade stories about wrangling humans, Hortman in the House, Sophie with her students.

“I know I have been deeply damaged by this,” Gov. Walz says of Hortman's death. “We all have.”


	“I can laugh and think of my mom and dad in a good way,” Sophie says. “But I know I can still go back to a bad place.”


	I catch Harold and Linda Haluptzok on a good day, if you can call it that.


	The Haluptzoks drink coffee at a quiet table at the Midland Hills Country Club. I ask them if they can share any stories of their daughter's foibles as a kid.


	“She was perfect,” says Linda with a smile. She reaches for Harold's hand. “She was a perfect baby.”


	Others are haunted by past conversations. I talk with former state Rep. Ryan Winkler, Hortman's friend and colleague. We meet at the Trailhead, a complex built at the base of hiking and cross-country skiing trails in Golden Valley. Winkler is handsome and an inveterate charmer, talking about how his admittedly bombastic approach to legislation sometimes collided with Hortman's no-bullshit approach.


	“You're just working against yourself,” Hortman would tell Winkler.


	We're about to leave when he asks if he can tell me one more thing. Winkler's eyes well up, and he can't get the words quite right.


	“The fact that the thing that she was afraid of would happen, and it happens in a way that is even worse than she feared. It wasn't just her, right? It was Mark, it was Gilbert.”


	Tears roll down his face.

	











	“It's like this guy somehow in his demented, deluded brain, he somehow managed to reach out and stab where we were weakest, where she was weakest.”


	Back at the Capitol, there remains a table of remembrance to “Our Beloved Melissa” outside the House chambers. Her name is still listed alphabetically on the wall with the other representatives.


	A floor above, Gov. Tim Walz looks much older than when I talked with him a year ago on the top floor of a church in Savannah, Georgia, where the windows were blacked out with campaign posters so that a sniper would not have a clear shot. Now, he sits in his office with a single aide and makes small talk about meeting Neil Young last weekend at Farm Aid. But his smile quickly fades. Walz spent the summer in torment, thinking of his conversations with Hortman and how she should be Minnesota's next governor.


	“I think she was thinking about it,” Walz says. He sighs and rubs his eyes. Melissa's death left him grappling with whether to retire or run again.


	“I know I have been deeply damaged by this,” Walz says in a quiet voice. “We all have.”


	In the end, Walz decides to run again.


	On my last day in Minnesota, I drive north to Brooklyn Park and the house at 8710 Windsor Terrace. I'd avoided visiting the house for two weeks, reasoning this story was about Hortman's life, not how it ended. But it's time to confront the damage done.


	Blocks away, I start to see “Thank You Melissa” signs in the yards of the comfortable three-car-garage homes. The sun shines brightly. Then I come to the Hortmans' home.


	The windows have been boarded up with plywood in the front and the back to protect against vandals. The front lawn, while carefully mowed, is brown and lifeless. A grill sits on the deck facing the golf course and conjures up a lonely John Cheever short story. What once was the warmest of homes is now an overrun fortress from a meaningless war.


	And then there's the garden. It's almost October, so Hortman's beloved flowers — the delphiniums, the orchids — are gone. The dandelions — the ones Mark swore his gardening robot would destroy — have taken over, along with some wilted black-eyed Susans. It is unbearably sad.


	But let me tell you one last thing about Melissa Hortman.


	She wouldn't have stood there, helpless, and moony-eyed. No, she would have asked a single question.


	“Are you gonna stand there and moan, or are you going to help me pull these damn weeds?

	











	“Let's fucking go.”

Rita Wilson shared a lengthy tribute to Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner. The actress appeared in two of Rob Reiner's films, North and The Story of Us, and co-starred with him in Sleepless in Seattle and Mixed Nuts.


	“Yes, there is the work we did together — the films will be there to experience over and over again,” Wilson wrote in Variety. “What can't ever be experienced again is running into Rob and Michele in the neighborhood and having a great laugh, or having dinner where Michele insists on having only one conversation.”


	She added, “Nights like Rob and Michele inviting Sid Caesar, Mel Brooks, Larry Gelbart and his dad, Carl Reiner, to show their favorite clips from ‘Your Show of Shows' and then talk about what it was like working together on that show. Or when they had ‘Bad Showbiz Night' parties, where you were invited to bring your worst showbiz moment and share it with a room full of luminaries, who also braved exposing their own.”


	Wilson remembered Michele as “a talented photographer who had a keen eye in her work and in her life” and noted that Rob “made history in multiple ways through his work.”

	“Both of them made a difference in their civic contributions and actions,” Wilson wrote. “They made the world a better place. They loved their kids. Each one. They did everything right. They loved. They were loved.”


	She concluded, “It's hard to reconcile the goodness they offered to the world with this ending. It doesn't make sense. But how they lived makes all the sense in the world.”

	











	Wilson previously published a tribute on Instagram that celebrated Michele's work as “an enormously talented photographer whose eye applied not only to what she captured on film but also to her own personal esthetic,” adding, “Her work as a producer focused on social justice and creating awareness of our world. She was wry, funny, opinionated but also reasonable and self reflective. She was so close to her sister and her family understanding the importance of close connection.”


	Rob and Michele Reiner died on Sunday, Dec. 14 in a double homicide inside their Los Angeles home. The cause of death was revealed as “multiple sharp force injuries.” Their 32-year-old son, Nick, who has since been charged with their murders. Nick was charged with first-degree murder and appeared in court on Wednesday wearing a blue suicide-prevention gown and a waist shackle. His arraignment was postponed until Jan. 7 after his lawyer said it was “too early” to enter a plea in the “very, very complex” case.

	The Reiners had three children together. On Wednesday, their older son Jake, 34, and daughter Romy, 27, broke their silence to share their grief and thank supporters.


	“Words cannot even begin to describe the unimaginable pain we are experiencing every moment of the day. The horrific and devastating loss of our parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, is something that no one should ever experience,” the siblings said in the statement obtained by Rolling Stone. “They weren't just our parents; they were our best friends.”

	Following Donald Trump‘s address to the nation Wednesday night — during which he spent nearly 20 minutes defending his handling of inflation and tariffs, while boasting about his alleged triumphs in 2025 — Jimmy Kimmel slammed the president's “surprise primetime episode of The Worst Wing.”


	“Yesterday, the president announced he'd be giving an impromptu liar side chat tonight in the middle of the season finales of Survivor and The Floor he interrupted,” continued the host during his Jimmy Kimmel Live! monologue. “It's weird to think that had a couple of states just gone the other way, he'd be hosting one of those shows. Trump shouldn't be preempting the floor. He should be mopping it.”


	Kimmel then read Trump's Truth Social post from the day before in which the president wrote, “My Fellow Americans: I will be giving an ADDRESS TO THE NATION tomorrow night, LIVE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE… I look forward to ‘seeing' you then. It has been a great year for our Country, and THE BEST IS YET TO COME!” After reading the president's post, Kimmel quipped, “I agree the Epstein files are due on Friday.”

	











	The president's year-end speech on Wednesday arrived amid his declining approval rating as many Americans across the country worry about inflation and the cost of living despite Trump's campaign promises to lower prices and “make America affordable again.” As his first term comes to an end, just 36 percent of Americans approve of the president's handling of the economy, according to a new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll.

	Trump is also embroiled in controversy over his alleged ties to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The president has denied any wrongdoing in relation to or prior knowledge of Epstein's sex crimes. In November, Trump signed a bill to force the the Department of Justice to release its case files on the Epstein — capitulating to pressure from within his own party after spending months trying to kill the measure.


	The president's speech did not address his administration's escalating threats against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

	The entertainment world was rocked on Sunday when comedy great Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found dead at their home in the upscale Los Angeles neighborhood of Brentwood. The horrific event turned even more shocking when it became clear that the main suspect was the couple's 32-year-old son, Nick. 


Nick Reiner was formerly charged with murder on Dec. 16. If convicted, he could face a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, or potentially the death penalty (though Gov. Gavin Newsom currently has a moratorium on executions in the state). 


	The following day, Nick's siblings, Jake and Romy, broke their silence in a statement: “Words cannot even begin to describe the unimaginable pain we are experiencing every moment of the day. The horrific and devastating loss of our parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, is something that no one should ever experience. They weren't just our parents; they were our best friends.”

	











	They continued: “We are grateful for the outpouring of condolences, kindness, and support we have received not only from family and friends but people from all walks of life. We now ask for respect and privacy, for speculation to be tempered with compassion and humanity, and for our parents to be remembered for the incredible lives they lived and the love they gave.”

	As the criminal case gets underway, and more details about the alleged crime emerge, here is everything we know (and don't know) so far about this staggering Hollywood tragedy. 

	











	Reiner and Singer were found dead Sunday afternoon, Dec. 14. Paramedics were called to the home at around 3:30 p.m., and officers were dispatched after firefighters discovered a death. 


	In an interview with The New York Times, a person close to the Reiner family (who requested anonymity) said the bodies were discovered after a message therapist showed up at the house for a scheduled appointment, but was unable to enter. The massage therapist called the couple's daughter, Romy Reiner, who came by with a roommate. Romy entered the house, found her father's dead body, and ran back outside, at which point her roommate called 911.

	It was only after paramedics arrived that Romy learned that her mother was dead, as well. At this point, the source said, Romy informed authorities that her brother, Nick, was living in a guest house on the property, but she did not suggest that he might be a suspect or involved in any way. At the time, Nick was not on the property. 


	Investigators descended on the Reiner home Sunday night, and there was plenty of chaos and confusion as detectives revealed they were still waiting for a warrant to properly search the house. At the time, too, Los Angeles Police Department Deputy Chief Alan Hamilton said police were “not seeking anyone as a suspect or as a person of interest.” But already, sources were telling Rolling Stone and other outlets that Nick was believed to have been involved in the homicides. 


	Nick was the couple's second of three children, born after his brother Jake and before his younger sister, Romy. While not much is known about Nick's childhood, it is known that he had a complicated relationship with his parents and had long battled drug addiction, including cocaine and heroin. He first went to rehab at 15 and spent much of his teenage years rotating in and out of facilities. In between rehab stints, he was often homeless. 


	“If I wanted to do it my way and not go to the programs they were suggesting, then I had to be homeless,” Nick told People in 2016, adding: “I was homeless in Maine. I was homeless in New Jersey. I was homeless in Texas. I spent nights on the street. I spent weeks on the street. It was not fun.”

	After Nick got clean at 19, his parents spoke about the challenges he faced in rehab and acknowledged their own shortsightedness regarding the efficacy of these programs for their son. “When Nick would tell us that it wasn't working for him, we wouldn't listen,” Rob told The Los Angeles Times in 2015. “We were desperate, and because the people had diplomas on their wall, we listened to them when we should have been listening to our son.”

	











	Michele added, “We were so influenced by these people. They would tell us he's a liar, that he was trying to manipulate us. And we believed them.”


	Nick went on to co-write a semi-autobiographical film called Being Charlie, which Rob Reiner directed. The film, which was released in 2016, centered around the relationship between a troubled son and his famous father. In the same L.A. Times interview in 2015, Nick admitted he wasn't sure he wanted to make the film, while Rob said, “It was very, very hard going through it the first time, with these painful and difficult highs and lows. And then making the movie dredged it all up again.”


	On Saturday night, Dec. 13, the Reiners attended a holiday party at Conan O'Brien's house. Though only the couple were invited, sources told Rolling Stone that the Reiners asked if they could bring Nick out of concern for him and to “keep an eye on him.” According to The Hollywood Reporter, the Reiners were reluctant to leave Nick at home unsupervised, and they had been concerned about his recent behavior, which was described as extreme and stressful. 


	Reports on what exactly happened at the party vary somewhat, but all paint a similar, and unnerving, picture. Sources told Rolling Stone that Nick exhibited “antisocial behavior,” such as staring at people. Other outlets, like THR and The Wall Street Journal, claimed that Nick was wandering around the party asking people if they were famous. He reportedly interrupted the comedian Bill Hader while he was speaking with someone else; after Hader told Nick he was having a private conversation, Nick allegedly glared at him for a long time, per The WSJ. 


	Not long after, there were reports that Rob and Nick got into a fight over Nick's behavior. Rob and Michele reportedly apologized to O'Brien and left the party, though it's still unclear if Nick left with them. 


	The person close to the Reiners, who spoke with the Times, did not dispute these accounts, but did downplay the reported intensity of the interaction between Rob and Nick. The source also took issue with the suggestion that Rob and Michele would have left the party early, noting that the Reiners had grown used to Nick's behavior over the years. 


	Questions still linger about what exactly happened afterward. The L.A. County D.A.'s office would eventually claim that Nick fatally stabbed his parents in the early hours of Dec. 14. A coroner for the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office eventually confirmed the couple died Sunday from “multiple sharp force injuries.”

	











	According to several reports, Nick checked into the Pierside Santa Monica hotel at some point on Sunday, though it's not clear when he arrived at the hotel. And by the time police tracked him there, Nick was gone. Employees at the hotel told the L.A. Times that police were still investigating the hotel, and the possible role it may have played in the alleged crime, as recently as Tuesday. 


	Nick was taken into custody Sunday night, Dec. 14, hours after his parents' bodies were found. He was booked just after 5 a.m. on Monday, Dec. 15. A manhunt led by the LAPD's Gang and Narcotics Division, along with a U.S. Marshals task force, tracked Nick to Exposition Park, near the University of Southern California, which is about 15 miles from the Reiner's home. 


	It's still unclear how exactly how authorities found Nick, but local ABC affiliate KABC obtained footage that appeared to show Nick at a gas station convenience store before his arrest. The station also showed video of a swarm of police vehicles descending on Nick outside the convenience store. 


	Neither prosecutors nor investigators have spoken yet on a possible motive for the alleged crime. There's also been much speculation about Nick's recent mental health and the tension between him and his parents in the lead-up to the alleged crime. While some reporting around the O'Brien party suggested the Reiners were growing increasingly concerned with Nick's behavior, the person who spoke with the Times said nothing had happened in recent weeks to suggest Nick was capable of such an attack. 


	Just three months ago, Rob Reiner seemed upbeat about Nick in an interview with NPR. While speaking, reflecting on their film, Being Charlie, Reiner said, “He's been great … hasn't been doing drugs for over six years. He's in a really good place.”


	Nick is officially facing two counts of first-degree murder, as well as a special allegation that he used a dangerous and deadly weapon, a knife. Reiner is being held in a downtown Los Angeles jail without bail.

	An arraignment was originally expected to take place Dec. 16, but Nick's attorney, Alan Jackson, told reporters that he was not medically cleared to appear in court. On Dec. 17, Nick did appear in court, seated in a plexiglass-enclosed pen and wearing a padded blue suicide-prevention gown with a shackle around his waist. Jackson asked to postpone his plea until Jan. 7, and when the judge asked if Nick agreed to waive his right to a speedy arraignment, he replied, “Yes, your honor.”

	











	Outside the courthouse, Jackson told reporters: “This is a devastating tragedy that has befallen the Reiner family. We all recognize that. Our hearts go out to the entire Reiner family. There are very, very complex and serious issues that are associated with this case. They need to be thoroughly but very carefully dealt with and examined and looked at and analyzed.”

Steven Spielberg is diving back into the extraterrestrial unknown with Disclosure Day, and if the reactions from his all-star cast are any indication, this could be the director's most emotionally charged alien adventure since the days of E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

The first trailer for the highly anticipated UFO thriller has finally landed, offering tantalizing glimpses into a story that grapples with one of humanity's biggest questions: Are we truly alone in the universe?

Written by frequent Spielberg collaborator David Koepp (Jurassic Park) and based on an original story from the maestro himself, Disclosure Day explores the profound implications of alien discovery. In a chilling moment from the teaser, Elizabeth Marvel's character poses the haunting query: “Why would he make such a vast universe yet save it only for us?”

The trailer highlights the tension between secrecy and revelation, with Josh O'Connor's character passionately declaring, “People have a right to know the truth, it belongs to 7 billion people.” It's a line that underscores the film's core theme: the human struggle for transparency in the face of world-altering secrets.

Leading the impressive ensemble are:

Emily Blunt

Josh O'Connor

Colin Firth

Colman Domingo

Eve Hewson

Wyatt Russell

Cast members can't stop raving about the script's emotional depth. Josh O'Connor, fresh off his acclaimed roles, described it as “like old-school Spielberg,” adding, “I think people will be excited.”

But it's Colman Domingo who truly captures the film's soul-stirring power: “I finished reading the script and I bawled. I thought it was one of the most beautiful scripts about our humanity. I think it was just the most beautiful film about our humanity, and I literally cried because Steven Spielberg believes in the possibility of the human beings we could be.”

Screenwriter David Koepp echoed that sentiment, calling the project “a very emotional experience.”

This marks Spielberg's grand return to the sci-fi genre he helped define, following his deeply personal 2022 drama The Fabelmans, which earned seven Oscar nominations. After exploring war, adventure, and autobiography in recent years, Spielberg is revisiting the awe-inspiring world of aliens that captivated audiences in classics like War of the Worlds and E.T.

Fans have long craved this comeback, and early buzz suggests Disclosure Day delivers that signature blend of spectacle and heart.

Set for a summer 2026 release, Disclosure Day will land amid a stacked blockbuster season featuring heavy-hitters like Toy Story 5, Christopher Nolan's The Odyssey, Minions 3, Supergirl, a live-action Moana, and He-Man: Masters of the Universe. Yet, with its timely exploration of disclosure and humanity's place in the cosmos, Spielberg's latest feels uniquely positioned to stand out — not just as entertainment, but as a cinematic event that might spark real conversations about the stars above us.

Spielberg's enduring belief in wonder and human potential has always been his superpower, and Disclosure Day seems ready to reignite that magic for a new generation. Get your tissues ready — this one might just make you believe again.

Are you hyped for Steven Spielberg's emotional UFO return in Disclosure Day? Which of his classic alien movies is your all-time favorite, and why? Drop your thoughts in the comments — let's geek out together!

An updated analysis of data captured by NASA's Cassini Mission, led by NASA scientists and researchers from the University of Washington, has decreased the chances of a subsurface ocean on Saturn's moon Titan but potentially increased the chances of finding extraterrestrial life.

While the new analysis also suggests that more complex life forms may have difficulty surviving in the slushy environment they suspect lies beneath Titan's icy surface, the researchers suspect that smaller pockets of water could increase the overall chances of finding simpler life forms like those found in Earth's polar environments.

One of 274 moons orbiting Saturn, Titan has long fascinated scientists due to its unique surface features. For example, Titan is the only solar system body besides Earth that may potentially have liquids on its surface, in the form of methane and ethane. The moon also experiences periodic rainfall, making it the only moon known to experience precipitation that reaches its surface.

But unlike Earth's oceans, Titan's lakes, rivers, and rains are made of hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane, not liquid water. When combined with its icy surface temperature of –290 degrees Fahrenheit (–179°C), it is considered unlikely that life could exist in any of those liquid environments.

When NASA scientists first analyzed data from Cassini's decade-plus mission to Saturn and its moons, the initial readings suggested that a large, liquid-water ocean may exist beneath Titan. The discovery fueled speculation about possible extraterrestrial life forms living in such an ocean, including whether more complex life could exist under such conditions.

More recently, evidence has mounted that several other solar system moons, including Saturn's “Death Star” moon Mimas and Jupiter's Ganymede and Europa, may also have massive seawater oceans underneath their icy shells. Those discoveries have once again increased optimism that future missions to those space bodies could discover the first irrefutable evidence of life beyond Earth.

In the new analysis, the team set out to characterize Titan's potential subsurface ocean. Specifically, they wanted to understand the degree to which the moon stretches in response to Saturn's gravitational pull and the duration of that stretching to determine the energy required. The team said this is critical because the moon's stretching was the first major clue that led researchers to propose the possibility of an ocean back in 2008.

“The deformation we detected during the initial analysis of the Cassini mission data could have been compatible with a global ocean,” explained Baptiste Journaux, a University of Washington assistant professor of Earth and space sciences.

Still, the researcher explained, the moon's “degree of deformation” depends on Titan's internal structure.

“A deep ocean would permit the crust to flex more under Saturn's gravitational pull, but if Titan were entirely frozen, it wouldn't deform as much,” Journaux said.

Where previous models had supported the possibility of an ocean beneath Titan, the team's newest models added a component not included in earlier versions: the timing of the deformations. The NASA-led team said that adding this variable was critical, since a closer analysis of the Cassini data showed that Titan's most considerable deformation occurs roughly 15 hours after Saturn's peak gravitational pull.

After adding this delay to the updated models, the team found that much more energy was being dissipated in Titan than previously estimated. This increased energy dissipation allowed them to make more informed inferences about the moon's interior structure. Specifically, the long deformation delay indicated the interior structure was much thicker and viscous than simple water, since more energy was needed to cause a change in Titan's shape.

“Nobody was expecting very strong energy dissipation inside Titan,” said the study's leader, Flavio Petricca, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “That was the smoking gun indicating that Titan's interior is different from what was inferred from previous analyses.”

Journaux said the results suggest Titan's icy surface has a thick, slushy layer beneath that requires more energy to deform than water does.

“Instead of an open ocean like we have here on Earth, we're probably looking at something more like Arctic sea ice or aquifers,” the researcher explained.

When discussing the new analysis, Journaux said that a slushier Titan interior could have “implications for what type of life we might find.” For instance, a thicker or more viscous environment might lead to nutrients gathering in small areas of water rather than being dispersed throughout an entire global ocean. The team said this increased nutrient density could “facilitate the growth of simple organisms.”

The new model also suggested that these theoretical pockets of nutrient-dense water could reach 68 degrees Fahrenheit in highly localized, transient briny areas under specific conditions, influenced by Saturn's gravity. The researchers said this warmer environment could also increase the chances of extraterrestrial life on Titan.

“The discovery of a slushy layer on Titan also has exciting implications for the search for life beyond our solar system,” Journaux said. “It expands the range of environments we might consider habitable.”

The team said their updated models suggest that future missions to Titan, such as NASA's Dragonfly Mission, which includes Journaux as part of the team, may not discover “fish wriggling through slushy channels.” Instead, if a future mission does find signs of life on Saturn's enigmatic moon, it may resemble the simpler life forms found on Earth's polar ecosystems.

The study “Titan's strong tidal dissipation precludes a subsurface ocean” was published in Nature.

Our first contact with extraterrestrial civilization is unlikely to be anything like it is depicted in science fiction. In reality, we will most likely witness its death throes. This is the conclusion reached by British astronomer David Kipping.

Over the decades, science fiction writers have described many different scenarios for first contact — from a highly advanced civilization trying to help Earthlings to an invasion by hordes of warlike enslavers. But according to David Kipping, another option is much more realistic. In his article, published on the arXiv preprint server, he proposed the so-called “eschatological hypothesis.” According to this hypothesis, our first contact with extraterrestrial intelligence will be atypical.

Kipping came to this conclusion while studying the history of astronomy. As a rule, the first astrophysical object or phenomenon of a new class to be discovered is atypical and unrepresentative. This is because it is much easier for astronomers to find objects with large observational signatures due to existing detection methods and their biases.

Exoplanets are a good example. The first exoplanets in history were discovered in the early 1990s near a pulsar. But now we know that this discovery was unique. Of the more than five thousand exoplanets known to us today, less than 10 are pulsar planets.

This argument also holds true for stars that can be seen with the naked eye. Depending on the circumstances, we can see about 2,500 stars in the night sky. About a third of them are evolved giant stars. But if we look at the actual ratio, it becomes clear that such stars account for only a small fraction of the total stellar population of the Milky Way. We see them only because their observational signal is very strong, while we do not notice the much more common red dwarfs because they are very dim.

Kipping extends this analogy to first contact. In his opinion, the first signs of extraterrestrial intelligence will also be very unusual, “loud,” and easily detectable—because it is most likely in the process of dying out. In other words, it is much more likely that we will hear the death cry of a doomed civilization than a civilization that is developing steadily.

Our own Earth can be used as an analogy. Human activity is changing the planet's climate and increasing the amount of carbon dioxide and chemical pollutants in the atmosphere. The more there are, the easier it is for aliens to detect them and understand that Earth is inhabitable. However, the more pollutants there are, the closer humanity will be to ecological collapse, which could lead to its extinction. Thus, according to the eschatological hypothesis, well-recorded technosignatures may be a by-product of a dying civilization. Kipping even speculates that the famous “Wow!” signal was a call for help.

All this means that instead of focusing on narrowly defined technosignatures, programs searching for extraterrestrial intelligence should give priority to bright anomalous phenomena whose luminosity and temporal scales are difficult to reconcile with known astrophysical phenomena. In this regard, observatories that constantly monitor changes in the sky, such as the recently launched Vera Rubin Observatory, should play a particularly important role. According to Kipping, they have the best chance of making first contact.

    After more than 10 years on Netflix, the Winchesters are relocating to a new streaming home.
  

Supernatural, the hit monster-hunting show that ran on the WB and then later on the CW for 15 seasons, has been a reliable Netflix mainstay for more than a decade. The show has been available to stream on Netflix since 2012, making it one of the most consistent series available there for over a decade, with new seasons added to the platform shortly after they aired on the CW. When the series ended its run on network TV, Netflix's licensing agreement gave it the rights to host all 15 seasons for a period of five years from the date of the show's final season. 

The final episode of Supernatural, which starred Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles as Sam and Dean Winchester, siblings who are paranormal investigators and demon hunters, aired on Nov. 19, 2020. This means those five years are up and the show has officially left the platform. You know how sometimes you take things for granted without even realizing it? Supernatural on Netflix is one of those instances when you don't truly appreciate what you have until it's taken away.

The news isn't all bad, though. Supernatural won't be off streaming for long. You'll be able to watch all 15 seasons on Peacock starting next week, as the series will start streaming there on Dec. 22.

If you don't subscribe to Peacock, or just want to own the series outright so you don't have to worry about it jumping from platform to platform, the show is also available to purchase on Prime Video for $0.48 an episode or $8 a season, and on Apple TV and Fandango Now, where prices range from $10 to $25 a season.

While there is no deal available at the moment for Peacock, we encourage you to stay on the lookout for streaming deals which do pop up occasionally. However, there are other ways to get Peacock Premium at no — or low — cost if you're savvy.","{'href': 'https://www.cnet.com', 'title': 'CNET'}","other"

For now many fakes are easy to spot. But audiences could find it increasingly difficult to tell fact from fiction as tech improves

Full report: Bondi terror attack

Victims of Bondi beach shooting

Misinformation, turbocharged by AI, was hard to avoid in the hours and days that followed the Bondi beach terror attack, as some platforms pushed dubious claims to users trying to find factual information.

The X “for you” page, which serves up content determined by an algorithm, was filled with false details, including: that the attack that left 15 people dead was a psyop or false-flag operation; that those behind the attack were IDF soldiers; that those injured were crisis actors; that an innocent person was one of the alleged attackers; and that the Syrian Muslim hero who fought the attackers was a Christian with an English name.

Generative AI only made matters worse.

An altered clip of the New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, with deepfaked audio making false claims about the attackers, was shared across multiple accounts.

In another particularly egregious example, an AI-generated image based on an actual photo of the victims was altered to suggest he was a crisis actor having red makeup applied to his face to look like blood.

“I saw these images as I was being prepped to go into surgery today and will not dignify this sick campaign of lies and hate with a response,” the man depicted in the fake image, human rights lawyer Arsen Ostrovsky, later posted on X.

Pakistan's information minister, Attaullah Tarar, said his country had been the victim of a coordinated online disinformation campaign in the wake of the Bondi beach terror attack, with false claims circulating that one of the suspects was a Pakistani national.

The man who was falsely identified told Guardian Australia it was “extremely disturbing” and traumatising to have his photo circulated on social media next to claims he was the alleged attacker.

Tarar said the Pakistani man was “a victim of a malicious and organised campaign” and alleged the disinformation campaign originated in India.

Meanwhile X's AI chatbot Grok told users that an IT worker with an English name was the hero who tackled and disarmed one of the alleged shooters, rather than the Syrian-born Ahmed al-Ahmed. This claim seems to have originated on a website that was set up on the same day as the terror attack to mimic a legitimate news site.

AI-generated images of Ahmed also proliferated on social media, promoting crypto schemes and fake fundraisers.

It was a far cry from Twitter's heyday as a hub for breaking news. Misinformation was floating around back then too, but it was less common and it wasn't served up via an algorithm designed to reward engagement based on outrage (particularly for verified accounts that stand to financially benefit from that engagement).

Many of the posts touting false claims had hundreds of thousands or even millions of views.

Legitimate news was circulating on X, but it was buried under misinformation turbocharged by AI.

When Musk took over X, he dismantled the site's factchecking scheme in favour of a user rating system called “community notes”, which appends crowdsourced user factchecking to posts. Other platforms are following suit. Meta has dismantled its previous factchecking system in favour of implementing its own version of community notes.

But, as the QUT lecturer Timothy Graham said this week, the community notes system isn't helpful in situations where opinions are deeply divided. It takes too long. Community notes have since been applied to many of the above examples, but it happened long after most people would have seen the original posts in their feeds.

X is trialling having Grok generate its own community notes to factcheck posts, but if the Ahmed example is anything to go by this is even more worrying.

The company did not respond to questions about what it is doing to tackle misinformation posted on its platform, or propagated by its AI chatbot.

A saving grace is that many of the fakes are still easily spotted – for now. The fake Minns, for example, had a American twinge in the accent, making it obvious it wasn't him. The crisis actor post had many of the hallmarks of dodgy AI image generation, such as incorrectly generated text on a T-shirt.

For the most part, media outlets ignored the posts or called them out.

But as AI models improve that could change, making it even harder to distinguish fact from fiction. Meanwhile, AI companies and the platforms hosting their content appear indifferent to doing anything to prevent it.

Digi, the industry group representing the social media platforms in Australia, proposed dropping a requirement to tackle misinformation from an industry code earlier this year, saying “recent experience” demonstrated “misinformation is a politically charged and contentious issue within the Australian community”.

It's hard to see how this week will change things.

In the wake of Sunday's tragic Bondi shooting, conspiracy theories and deliberate misinformation have spread on social media.

One thing some people have latched onto is the idea Google Trends data show a spike in searches for “Naveed Akram” – the name of one of the attackers – from Tel Aviv (or other locations) before the shooting occurred. In a surprising lateral jump, this is taken to show Akram must be an Israeli agent.

Similar stories did the rounds when US right-wing activist Charlie Kirk was killed in September, and after an attack on US National Guard members in November.

So what's going on here? Google told the ABC Google Trends may sometimes show searches when none actually happened due to “statistical noise”.

I have studied the mechanics of Google Trends extensively in my research, and I can confirm this is true – and the “noise” can lead to strange results, especially when looking at searches for unusual terms or coming from small areas.

Google Trends shows information about what users are searching for at different places and times. The data it uses are what statisticians call a “time series”, but they are unusual in a couple of ways.

First, you can very easily select different time scales, such as minute-by-minute and year-by-year.

Second is the fact the data are only a small sample of the true gigantic volume of Google searches. Time series normally contain all available data (such as these statistics on annual hospitalisations). 

The Google Trends help page explains this as follows:

While only a sample of Google searches are used in Google Trends, this is sufficient because we handle billions of searches per day.

However, my research has shown that queries related to terms that are not widely searched (such as “Naveed Akram” before the shooting) or in small geographical regions (where there are fewer people doing searches) can display a wide variation of results from one sample to the next. 

Many of the misleading social media posts show Trends results from a small region (such as only the city of Tel Aviv), which exacerbates the variation. The high variation causes a very distinct pattern of zero or near-zero values with some isolated big spikes, which is very evident in the post below.

These spikes are often caused by “statistical noise” in the data – small random fluctuations that are smoothed out when we look at a larger number of events. You can see this clearly when you compare with searches that have high volume.

Another misconception about the data is related to time. Some posts mention how the displayed results seem to change from one view to the next. This is, in fact, exactly what to expect with Google Trends data. 

This is a combination of the time scale used and the fact Google uses only a sample of the full data. To get accurate results, one has to aggregate many samples of Google Trends data. 

However, this presents a new challenge. For short-term data (such as that typically used in these social media posts), Google continually updates results in real time. For longer-term data, Google only adds one new sample per day (though we have developed methods to get around this).

A third misconception is that the numbers shown on Google Trends charts are the number of searches for a given term. However, the Google Trends help again explains that the values are “normalised to the time and location” and then “scaled on a range of 0 to 100”. 

This means the time point in the series with the highest number of searches is set to 100, and all other points are scaled relative to that. So if the maximum number of searches was ten, it would show up as 100 – and if there were three searches at another time, this would show up as 30 (although Google does suppress very low-volume searches).

In a sense, the number for each time point represents the likelihood that a search containing the specified terms would occur in that place at that time. 

So a post about search trends for the alleged killer of Charlie Kirk claiming there are “Less than 1 in 1 BILLION odds of it happening” is incorrect. 

It is, in fact, highly probable: if “Tyler James Robinson” (Charlie Kirk's alleged killer) had 30 searches, and “Lance Twiggs” (Robinson's partner) had 40, one would see exactly this pattern (if 40 is scaled to 100; 30 is accordingly scaled to 75).

Even without understanding all this information about Google Trends data, some common sense can also help. For example, there are many people named Naveed Akram, including a Pakistani footballer named Muhammad Naveed Akram. 

That there might have been a few searches for “Naveed Akram” even before December 14 is therefore not surprising. (Google Trends returns any search containing the query, so “Naveed Akram” will also return “Muhammad Naveed Akram”.)

Google Trends data can be incredibly useful for understanding events in real time. For example, it has been used to predict — with a margin of error — the outcomes of elections and referendums.

However, to do so properly, and not perpetuate fiction, one has to understand the data and interpret the results properly. And Google Trends certainly does not tell us anything about Naveed Akram and the Bondi terror attack.

12:00: Special rebroadcast — The book that was written to prevent Parkinson's disease

1:00: Special rebroadcast — A $10,000 bet on conspiracy theories

We bring you special rebroadcasts today on ""Connections with Evan Dawson.""

In their new book, “The Parkinson's Plan,” Dr. Ray Dorsey and his co-author, Dr. Michael Okun, present Parkinson's disease as utterly preventable. A diagnosis of the disease, they explain, is not an unlucky break, but rather the result of environmental and chemical factors. The doctors argue that we can prevent Parkinson's by making changes in our lives, and we can build a world where no one in the future gets the disease. They're calling on the federal government to support the kinds of changes that could lead to dramatic effects. We talk about their ambitious plan in this special rebroadcast. Our guest:

Then in our second hour, Zach Mack is a public radio producer whose father became obsessed with conspiracy theories. And then Zach's dad made him a bet: $10,000 — $1,000 for each of 10 predictions. His dad said that Obama would be arrested for treason, that Trump would be reinstated as president before the 2024 election. Zach took the bet, hoping it would break his father from his conspiracy theories. Zach's family, including his dad, agreed to regular interviews throughout 2024, leading up to the bet's conclusion. Zach turned it all into a podcast series, and now he joins us to discuss what happened — and what he learned about conspiratorial thinking in this special rebroadcast. Our guest:

Astronomers traced a mysterious 'scar' of ionized gas around the solar system to two stars that had a close flyby with our sun millions of years ago.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Roughly 4.5 million years ago, the sun passed remarkably close to two intensely bright stars whose radiation flooded nearby space — and the encounter left a ghostly scar that astronomers can still detect today, according to a new study.

The research team says the close pass helps to solve a decades-old mystery of why the space around our solar system is far more energized than models predict, including why it contains a surplus of ionized helium.

Using computer models to rewind the paths of stars near the sun, a team led by University of Colorado Boulder astrophysicist Michael Shull found that two blue-white stars, Beta Canis Majoris and Epsilon Canis Majoris, passed within 30 light-years of the sun about 4.5 million years ago.

Today, the stars mark the front and rear legs of the constellation Canis Major (the Great Dog), more than 400 light-years from the solar system. But roughly 4.5 million years ago, when the stars brushed past the solar system, they were younger, hotter and brighter. Their passage also may have overlapped with the time when Lucy — a remarkably complete fossil of an early human ancestor discovered in Ethiopia in 1974 — walked the Earth.

""They weren't headed straight toward us...but that's close,"" Shull told Live Science. ""If Lucy and her friends had looked up and had noticed the stars, the two brightest stars in the sky would have been not Sirius, but Beta and Epsilon Canis Majoris.""

The findings were published Nov. 24 in The Astrophysical Journal.

Today, the solar system drifts through a diffuse patchwork of more than a dozen nearby wisps of gas and dust called the local interstellar medium, made primarily of hydrogen and helium and extending roughly 30 light-years from the sun.

Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

Astronomers think these clouds were sculpted over several million years by shock waves from exploding stars in the Scorpius-Ophiuchus region, a rich cluster of massive stars about 300 light-years from Earth, which compressed interstellar gas into the thin local clouds seen today.

 




Observations dating back to the 1990s, including from NASA's now-retired Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer space telescope, revealed that this region is unusually ionized. Helium atoms, in particular, have been stripped of their electrons at nearly twice the rate expected relative to hydrogen.

That imbalance has puzzled astronomers, because helium requires more energetic radiation to ionize than hydrogen does. This makes its elevated ionization difficult to explain with the sun's radiation alone, which does not extend that far beyond the solar system.

To investigate the mystery, Shull and his colleagues calculated the properties and ultraviolet output of Beta and Epsilon Canis Majoris, using measurements from the European Space Agency's Hipparcos satellite, which mapped the positions of more than a million stars across a four-year mission that ended in 1993.

Knowing how far away the two stars are today — about 400 light-years — and how fast they are moving allowed the team to trace the stars' paths backward through time to reconstruct their close pass by the solar system roughly 4.5 million years ago.

The team's models show that the wispy local clouds would have been intensely ionized by the two stars' radiation — at levels up to 100 times stronger than those seen today. Over time, the gas would have slowly returned to a more neutral state through a process called recombination, in which free electrons reattach to ions and become atoms.

""It's like a dance floor,"" Shull told Live Science. ""You've got protons and electrons dancing around, and sometimes they're dancing together and sometimes they're popping apart.""

But that process takes time, and continued exposure to radiation from other sources continues to keep the gas partially ionized, Shull said. Astronomers had previously identified other sources of ionizing radiation, including three nearby white dwarf stars — G191-B2B, Feige 24 and HZ 43A — compact stellar remnants that are known to emit strong ultraviolet light. Researchers also pointed to the Local Bubble — a vast, supernova-blown region of hot gas that extends about 1,000 light-years around the solar system.

""More energetic photons preferentially ionized helium,"" he said. ""That's the bottom line.""

Although astronomers have had reliable stellar motion data for decades, Shull said the problem became solvable only recently. Advances in ultraviolet and X-ray observations made possible by suborbital rocket flights, along with improved models of stellar evolution and atmospheres — and the computing power needed to run them — finally allowed researchers to connect the dots.

—James Webb telescope does it again: The earliest black hole in the known universe may have been found

""The problem was ripe in the sense that all the pieces of the puzzle of the mystery were starting to come together,"" Shull said.

The findings also may have implications closer to home. The local clouds help shield the planet from high-energy particles that roam the galaxy and that scientists suspect could erode Earth's ozone layer.

The sun, however, is not expected to remain inside these clouds indefinitely. As it drifts onward through the galaxy, researchers estimate it could exit the protective region in as few as 2,000 to a few tens of thousands of years. ""Then, we're going to be in for a big dose of radiation,"" Shull said.

Looking ahead, Shull said that understanding how atoms in the wispy local clouds shifted between more charged and more neutral states as radiation waxed and waned while the two stars approached, passed by and moved away from our solar system remains part of a larger puzzle researchers are still assembling. ""The problem isn't completely solved,"" Shull said, ""but I think we have the right track.""

      There have recently been multiple articles on these subs speculating about “the full truth” about NHIs, especially what could possibly be so alarming to the public that it has prevented official disclosure across the political spectrum worldwide. Simultaneously, insiders such as David Grusch who are aware of the alleged facts and are currently advocating for disclosure have stated that any public disclosure that does occur would need to be managed extremely carefully.
    


      Since these questions are regularly coming up with increasing frequency, here is a reminder of the main reasons that the full truth would apparently be so difficult for the public to handle, according to several of the most high-profile alleged insiders from military backgrounds:
    


      The universe is dominated by a hierarchy of ""alpha/apex predator"" species.
    


      Humans are massively underestimating the dominant interstellar NHI civilisations' power and technological capabilities.
    


      As claimed by Grusch, Earth's governments don't currently have the ability to sufficiently protect the human civilian population from NHIs that ""want to do something to us"", which presumably refers to the alleged abductions, experiments, mutilations etc.
    


      UAPs with technological capabilities vastly superior to Earth's militaries have been operating freely in Earth's airspace, including what seem to be reconnaissance activities targeting Earth's militaries. Therefore, humans don't currently have control over our planet's airspace and would potentially be unable to protect Earth.
    


      There is a gulf between human psychology and the dominant NHIs' psychology, which is alien in the literal sense.
    


      Notwithstanding alleged hybrids, the apparent lack of psychological common ground with NHIs also means that humans are effectively alone in the universe.
    


      Humans are much less ""special"" in the grand scheme of things than we think. Humans may even be the equivalent of wildlife animals inside a zoo or enclosure.
    


      Humans may be permanently quarantined inside our solar system because our characteristics as intelligent, inquisitive, expansionist and (most of all) extremely violent armed primates cause us to pose a danger to the stability of NHI territory if we ever figure out how to get there.
    


      If all of these claims are true, then many people will react very badly to finding out that mankind is completely outclassed, outnumbered, outgunned, utterly alone, and permanently confined to a ""quarantined enclosure"" that our species will never be allowed to leave. It would certainly change one's perspective when looking up at the night sky.
    


      While such revelations would be a shock to people's notions of our species' place in the universe, and also have major implications for humanity's future deep space programs, the issue that may cause the biggest backlash is confirmation that humans (as individuals and as a species) are completely at the mercy of the dominant NHIs. It's our vulnerability, our lack of autonomy, and any related actions the NHIs may be taking that target humans individually and Earth geopolitically, especially NHI activities that would be interpreted as malicious.
    


      Why is UAP recon activity apparently escalating now in particular? A feasible speculative explanation is that it may involve Point 8 in the list above. Perhaps technological breakthroughs enabling human interstellar travel are about to happen much sooner than we think, specifically because the capabilities of AI and Quantum Computing are accelerating much faster than expected.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

President Donald Trump, with approval ratings sagging, touted his economic and other policies in a White House address, taking jabs at his predecessor, former President Joe Biden. ""I inherited a mess,"" Trump said, referring to when he returned to the White House last January. ""And I am fixing it.""

Here's what to know:

The November consumer price index report, the first since the record government shutdown ended last month, is due out at 8:30 a.m. ET.

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect it to show a 12-month inflation rate of 3.1%. When excluding food and energy, core CPI is forecast to post an annual rate of 3.0%.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics has said the release ""will not include 1-month percent changes for November 2025 where the October 2025 data are missing,"" because the agency canceled the October inflation report in late November, weeks before the Federal Reserve's final meeting of the year.

Stock futures were ticking up ahead of the return of the monthly inflation report. 

Micron Technology jumped 10% in premarket trading after its latest results and forecast topped Wall Street estimates. Shares of Olive Garden parent Darden rose premarket on an improved sales outlook.

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the previous session lower for the fourth day in a row. Oracle had dropped more than 5% after the Financial Times reported that the cloud infrastructure company's primary investor pulled out of its $10 billion Michigan data center.

Trump Media and Technology Group on Thursday announced a merger agreement valued at more than $6 billion with TAE Technologies, a fusion power company, showing the company that operates President Donald Trump's Truth Social platform is branching out even further.

Shares of medical supply giant Medline, which makes everything from hospital beds to scrubs, jumped 41% in their Nasdaq debut Wednesday as the world's biggest IPO of the year. The stock opened at $35, up from its $29 IPO price, and ended its first trading day at $41 a share, bringing Medline's market capitalization to roughly $54 billion.

Just over 200 IPOs have priced this year despite market volatility in the spring, driven by President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs and the longest U.S. government shutdown in history in the fall. It is the largest U.S. listing since Rivian's $13.7 billion deal in November 2021, according to data compiled by CNBC.

Delta Air Lines President Glen Hauenstein, who helped shape Delta into the industry's profit leader, will retire at the end of February. Hauenstein, who joined Delta 20 years ago, led the airline's lucrative embrace of travelers willing to spend more for a more luxurious trip, or at least a few more inches of legroom on board. 

Some of Delta's strategies became too successful for customers' tastes, such as its popular airport SkyClubs, which Delta recently raised the entry bar.

And the winner is...YouTube.

Ronald Hicks, who endorsed message condemning ICE raids, to lead one of biggest US archdioceses

Pope Leo XIV has named a fellow Chicagoan as the next archbishop of New York, one of the biggest US archdioceses, in a signal that the church will continue its stance against the Trump administration on immigration.

The US-born pope chose 58-year-old Ronald Hicks, the current bishop of Joliet, Illinois, to lead the church in New York, replacing retiring Cardinal Timothy Dolan who has served for 16 years after being selected by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012.

Dolan is regarded as a conservative figure in the US Catholic church hierarchy. Hicks takes on the role of cardinal after Dolan last week finalized a plan to establish a $300m fund to compensate victims of sexual abuse who had brought legal action against the archdiocese.

Hicks addressed the issue at news conference on Thursday.

“As a church, we can never rest in our efforts to prevent abuse, to protect children and to care for survivors,” he said. “While this work is challenging, it's difficult, it's painful, I hope it will continue to help in the areas of accountability, transparency and healing.”

Notably, Leo and the US hierarchy have shown willingness to challenge the administration on its immigration policies. In October, Leo questioned whether the policies were in line with the Catholic church's “pro-life” teachings and described them as “inhuman”.

Hicks, 58, grew up in South Holland, Illinois, close to the Chicago childhood home of Leo, the former Robert Prevost. Both men served the church abroad: Leo spending 20 years as a missionary in Peru; Hicks spent five years in El Salvador heading a church-run orphanage.

Last month, Hicks endorsed a special message from the US Conference of Catholic Bishops condemning the Trump administration's immigration raids. The bishops said they “are disturbed when we see among our people a climate of fear and anxiety around questions of profiling and immigration enforcement. We are saddened by the state of contemporary debate and the vilification of immigrants”.

Hicks said the message expressed “our solidarity with all our brothers and sisters” and underlined their “concerns, opposition, and hopes with clarity and conviction”.

Leo and Hicks only met last year, when the provost and bishop visited one of Hicks's parishes, according to CNN. Hicks told local Chicago WGN-TV after Leo was elected pope that he recognized their shared backgrounds and priorities.

“We grew up literally in the same radius, in the same neighborhood together. We played in the same parks, went swimming in the same pools, like the same pizza places,” he said.

Hicks was born on 4 August 1967, in Harvey, Illinois, and received degrees in philosophy, divinity and ministry. He was ordained to the priesthood for the archdiocese of Chicago in 1994, according to the New York archdiocese.

In 2005, he moved from Chicago to El Salvador to begin his five-year term as regional director of Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos (NPH) in Central America. NPH is a home dedicated to caring for more than 3,400 orphaned and abandoned children in nine Latin American and Caribbean countries.

He returned to Chicago and in 2020 Pope Francis named him Bishop Hicks as the sixth bishop of the Catholic diocese of Joliet, Illinois, serving about 520,000 Catholics in seven counties. Hicks will now serve roughly 2.5 million Catholics in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island in New York City.

“I accept this appointment with humility and an open heart,” Hicks said at the news conference. “I ask for your support and your prayers, and I ask God to support us as always.” Dolan said his successor was “an early Christmas gift for the Archdiocese”.

TASS-FACTBOX. On December 17, 2025, Russian Defense Minister Andrey Belousov announced during the ministry's final year-end board meeting that the first regiment equipped with the S-500 system had entered combat duty, marking a major milestone in Russia's strategic missile defense capabilities. TASS-FACTBOX editors have prepared a report on the system.

The S-500 Prometheus (previously also referred to as the Triumfator-M) is a Russian anti-aircraft missile system. It is designed to engage the full spectrum of existing aerospace attack weapons of a potential enemy at all altitudes and speeds.

The exact performance characteristics of the S-500 have not been officially published. The system is being developed with the capability to be operational for the next 25 years.

The designer and manufacturer of the Prometheus is the Almaz-Antey Aerospace Defense Concern. The system was developed in the period from the 2000s to the 2020s as a supplement to the S-400 Triumph air defense system (in service in Russia since 2007) and other earlier-generation systems. The Prometheus is expected to fill a niche between military and strategic air defense and missile defense systems. The new system will interact with medium-and long-range air defense systems (S-300, S-400) and the Moscow and Central Industrial District air defense system.

Representatives of Almaz-Antey announced the preparation of a preliminary design for the S-500 air defense system in September 2009. The development was initially planned to be completed ""within 4-5 years,"" but the completion date was repeatedly rescheduled.

Since 2012, Almaz-Antey had been building new plants in Nizhny Novgorod and Kirov, which were planned, in particular, to manufacture components and conduct the final assembly of the S-500 air defense system. The production was launched in Kirov in 2016, and in Nizhny Novgorod in 2018. The training of specialists to operate the S-500 system started in 2017.

In July 2017, Deputy General Director of Almaz-Antey for Foreign Economic Activity Vyacheslav Dzirkaln said at the MAKS-2017 aerospace show that the high-altitude anti-missile system for the S-500 had passed ""the main part of tests.""

In February 2020, in an article published in the Radioelectronic Technologies corporate journal, Deputy Defense Minister Alexey Krivoruchko reported that S-500 missile tests were conducted in 2019 with launches of new missiles. He said the S-500 system would be capable of engaging medium-range ballistic missiles (independently intercepting missiles with a launch range of up to 3,500 km) and intercontinental ballistic missiles in the terminal phase of their trajectory, and in certain cases, in the mid-course phase.

In December 2019, Alexey Krivoruchko said in an interview with the Krasnaya Zvezda newspaper that preliminary S-500 tests would begin in 2020, with serial deliveries scheduled for 2025.

On March 26, 2020, General Director of the Design Bureau of Special Machine-Building (part of the Almaz-Antey concern) Vladimir Dolbenkov told the National Defense magazine that the S-500 components were in the final stage of testing: the launcher, components of the multifunctional locator and missile defense locator, chassis for the combat control post, and transport units for the early warning radar system.

Defense industry sources told TASS that the S-500 land-based version ""could also be used against ships if necessary."" On July 20, 2021, the Russian Defense Ministry reported that the S-500 had completed live-fire tests against a high-speed ballistic target at the Kapustin Yar range (Astrakhan Region). It was noted that the tests confirmed the specified tactical and technical characteristics.

On June 28, 2021, at a meeting in the Kremlin with graduates of higher military schools, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that new unique weapons systems would soon be deployed in Russia, including the S-500 Prometheus.

On July 29, 2021, a defense industry official told TASS that the Russian Defense Ministry and the Almaz-Antey Concern signed a contract on the supply the first batch of over 10 Prometheus systems to the Russian military. On August 11, a defense source told TASS that Almaz-Antey had begun manufacturing of serial missiles for the S-500 system in accordance with the contract signed with the Defense Ministry in late 2020.

On September 16, 2021, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov told reporters on the sidelines of the Tyumen Oil and Gas Forum that the S-500 systems delivery to the Russian military had begun. Asked about the system, Borisov specified: ""State tests have just been completed, and the first deliveries of this system have begun."" He added that India could potentially acquire the Prometheus after Russian troops are fully equipped with the system.

On December 18, 2024, Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Valery Gerasimov announced that the formation of the first regiment equipped with the S-500 anti-aircraft missile system was nearing completion.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Locals band together in David v Goliath battle against facility they say would jack up bills, increase pollution and destroy area's character

A who's who of the nation's most powerful politicians and tech tycoons are forcing through a proposal for a massive data center in rural Michigan as locals from across the political spectrum have come out in force against it, with one calling it “uniquely evil”.

Saline Township, Michigan, residents fear the $7bn center would jack up energy bills, pollute groundwater, and destroy the area's rural character. The 1.4 gigawatt center would consume as much power as Detroit, and would help derail Michigan's nation-leading transition to renewable energy.

Responding to resident pressure, Saline Township's board of trustees in September voted down the plans, but the data center's powerful backers – including Donald Trump, Open AI's Sam Altman, Oracle's Larry Ellison, Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, utility giant DTE Energy, and Stephen Ross, the real-estate billionaire and Trump donor who owns Related Co – fought back.

Related Digital sued, and, vastly outgunned, the township board quickly folded and reversed its decision over strong resident objections. Now the project's backers are trying to avoid minimal regulatory scrutiny on energy costs and pollution.

The controversy over the data center is representative of the David v Goliath fights playing out across the US, pitting working- and middle-class residents against the interests of billionaires and the political establishment.

“This is part of an experience that America and the world is having around tech billionaires who are seizing power and widening the gap between those have much too much … and the working and middle classes,” said Yousef Rabhi, a former Democratic state legislative leader and clean energy advocate who opposes the plans.

“That's what these data centers are symbolic of, and they're the vehicle for is the furtherance of this divide,” Rabhi added.

The proposal is part of the broader “Stargate” project composed of five data centers backed by the Trump administration, which granted $500bn in federal subsidies for them. It's the largest project in Michigan history in terms of investment, and it also received subsidies on taxes that could have gone to roads and schools, among other uses, Rabhi said.

The plan's supporters say the center would provide essential AI infrastructure, in part for national security, and create a few hundred jobs. Huge sums of money are at stake for the tech and utility companies.

Ross's Related Digital is the data center's developer, while OpenAI, which produced ChatGPT, and Oracle will use the center to house its AI infrastructure.

In a statement, Related Digital alleged company the township's decision violated zoning laws, and the spokesperson stressed the suit was filed jointly with three Saline Township property owners who are selling their property to Related.

“Thankfully, we were able to reach a settlement agreement with the township to allow this project to move forward,” the spokesperson said. They noted Related is also making about $14m in donations to local causes.

Saline Township is a small community of about 4,000 just outside Ann Arbor. The Stargate project is one of around a dozen data center proposals in Michigan over the last year that are strongly opposed at the local level. It's one of four proposed near Ann Arbor – last week, plans for a second a few miles away in a neighboring town surfaced.

Some municipalities have been successful in derailing plans, while others have lost the fight.

In Saline Township, former US marine Kate Haushalter and her husband are raising five children in a farmhouse next to the data center site. They bought and renovated the once-dilapidated home so they could live in a bucolic area, and Haushalter said she was not about to cede ground even though the township did.

“Maybe because I was in the Marine Corps, but I would rather stay and fight,” Haushalter said. “I'm sure the chances are slim, but it's worth fighting for, and I don't want to teach my kids to roll over.”

Big tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Open AI, which often own data centers, typically have enough political support at the state and federal levels that inexperienced local leaders who are comparatively poorly resourced are left on their own to defend their town from the centers.

Saline Township supervisor Jim Marion conveyed that challenge when he told angry residents during a contentious November discussion that the township's “hands were tied”.

“This township doesn't have the money to fight these big companies. You got to understand that,” Marion told the crowd. “We were dealt the cards we were dealt.”

Some municipalities have utilized zoning laws to block the centers. Beyond that, there's little local officials can do, and state and federal level regulations on the centers are virtually non-existent.

Still, residents are growing more organized. A first protest on 1 December drew about 200 people, who Rabhi described as “truly a cross-section of American society”. The next week, 800 people participated in a state-level public input session, and organizers are pressuring state environmental regulators to hold up the project's required wetland permits.

Among residents leading the pushback is Josh LeBaron, whose home sits about 500 yards from the site, where crews have broken down.

He characterized the project as “uniquely evil” because of the environmental risks, and because, he and others allege, the companies and government have been secretive about their plans. In response to questions about accusations of nimby-ism leveled against local residents by the project's supporters, LeBaron said he would not be opposed to other developments.

He noted that Michigan is full of former industrial sites that would be more appropriate for the 575-acre property.

“I would be at home reading a book if it were a subdivision,” LeBaron said.

A Related spokesperson told the Guardian the company “explored sites across Michigan before deciding on this site, which is ideal as it's a contiguous flat area”, and is set close to a major road and transmission lines.

Local opponents' best hope for holding up the project lies in the arcane utility regulatory process on the massive amount of power the data center would require.

DTE Energy claims the data center's power demands and need for expensive new infrastructure will not increase residential electricity prices.

But it doesn't want to show its math.

DTE filed a petition with the Michigan Public Services Commission (MPSC), the state agency that regulates utilities, asking the MPSC to fast-track the plan's approval. DTE's request for an “ex parte” case requires limited scrutiny of its claim that the center won't destroy the climate laws, or increase electricity bills.

In response, Michigan attorney general Dana Nessel and consumer advocacy groups filed a legal petition with the MPSC, calling for a “contested case” that would require much closer regulatory review of DTE's claims.

The MPSC is helmed by Whitmer appointees, and the governor has strongly backed the project, raising suspicions among opponents that the agency will approve the ex parte request.

Studies from across the country have shown data centers often increase rates, and DTE and regulators “cannot claim transparency while shutting the public out of the only process that requires DTE to support its claims with actual evidence”, said Bryan Smigielski, Michigan campaign organizer for the Sierra Club, which is intervening in the regulatory battle.

In a statement, a DTE spokesperson said: “To be clear, these data center customer contracts will NOT create a cost increase for our existing customers.”

DTE has said the project won't derail Michigan's transition to clean energy, but state data and DTE's plans suggest otherwise.

Michigan, in late 2023, passed nation-leading climate laws that require utilities to transition to renewable energy by 2040. But the law included an “off-ramp” that allows utilities to continue running or building fossil fuel plants if renewable sources cannot handle the energy grid's load.

At its peak, DTE's grid already demands about 9.5 gigawatts of power, while the grid's capacity is 11gw.

In July, DTE told investors it is in negotiations with big tech companies to provide 7gw of power for several proposed data centers.

The Saline center's 1.4gw may not cause an exceedance of the 11gw threshold, especially because DTE is planning to build battery storage. But the Saline center along with any of the other proposed centers likely would trigger the off-ramp.

DTE appears to be planning for that likelihood: DTE Energy executives said the company would likely need to build new gas plants to accommodate the data centers' demand.

Haushalter's kids were born in the renovated farmhouse and are homeschooled there.

She and her husband try to teach the kids to respect nature. The family manages beehives, watches the geese and plant trees for wood to use in their wood-burning stove. At night, they take the kids outdoors for bonfires to look at the stars. “We're not a big screen family,” Haushlater said.

The noise, light and air pollution is already disrupting the life the family built over 13 years. The center, if it is fully built, would fully destroy it, Haushalter said.

“We are really passionate about nature and teaching our kids about it and I can't believe the biggest construction project in Michigan is landing literally in my backyard, and there's no recourse for the little guy,” she said. “It's going to crush us.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Farmers in tractors blocked roads and set off fireworks in Brussels on Thursday outside a European Union leaders' summit, prompting police to respond with tear gas and water cannons as protesters rallied against a major free-trade deal with South American nations.

Farmers fear an agreement with the trade bloc known as Mercosur will undercut their livelihoods, and there are broader political concerns it is driving support for the far right.

The farmers brought potatoes and eggs to throw – along with sausages and beer for nourishment – and waged a furious back-and-forth with police.

“We are fighting to defend our jobs across all European countries against Mercosur,” said Armand Chevron, a 23-year old French farmer.

Police in riot gear staffed barriers just outside the European Parliament, which evacuated some staff due to damage caused by protesters.

In Brussels, protesters burned tires and a faux wooden coffin bearing the word “Agriculture.” Their fire unleashed a black cloud that swirled with white tear gas.

“We will not die in silence,” read one sign. “The dictatorship starts here,” read another.

Farmers fear that the deal will undercut their livelihoods, and there are broader political concerns that it could also help drive support for the far right. On Thursday they drove tractors through Brussels and set fire to coffins with the word agriculture printed across them.  

The Associated Press

Hundreds of farmers like Pierre Vromann, 60, had arrived on tractors, which they parked to block roads around the key institutions of the EU.

The Mercosur deal would be “bad for farmers, bad for consumers, bad for citizens and bad for Europe,” said Vromann, who raises cattle and cereals in the nearby Belgian city of Waterloo.

Other farmers came from as far away as Spain and Poland.

The clashes between the farmers and police raged just a stone's throw from the Europa building, where leaders of the 27 EU nations discussed the trade pact as well as a proposal to seize Russian assets for use in Ukraine.

Canada to resume free-trade talks with South American bloc Mercosur

On Wednesday, Italy signalled it had reservations, joining the French-led opposition to signing the massive transatlantic free-trade deal between the EU and the five active Mercosur countries – Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia. The deal would progressively remove duties on almost all goods traded between the two blocs over the next 15 years.

French President Emmanuel Macron dug in against the Mercosur deal as he arrived for Thursday's EU summit, pushing for further concessions and more discussions in January. He said he has been in discussions with Italian, Polish, Belgian, Austrian and Irish colleagues among others about delaying it.

“Farmers already face an enormous amount of challenges,″ he said, as farmer protests roil regions around France. “We cannot sacrifice them on this accord.”

Worried by a surging far right that rallies support by criticizing the deal, Macron's government has demanded safeguards to monitor and stop large economic disruption in the EU, increased regulations in the Mercosur nations like pesticide restrictions, and more inspections of imports at EU ports.

Premier Giorgia Meloni told the Italian Parliament on Wednesday that signing the agreement in the coming days “would be premature.”

“This doesn't mean that Italy intends to block or oppose (the deal), but that it intends to approve the agreement only when it includes adequate reciprocal guarantees for our agricultural sector,” Meloni said.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is determined to sign the agreement, but she needs the backing of at least two-thirds of EU nations.

Italy's opposition would give France enough votes to veto von der Leyen's signature.

In Greece, farmers have set up roadblocks along highways across the country for weeks, protesting delays in agricultural subsidy payments as well as high production costs and low product prices that they say are strangling their sector and making it impossible to make ends meet.

EU leaders to decide on using frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine's war effort

The accord has been under negotiation for 25 years. Once ratified, it would cover a market of 780 million people and a quarter of the globe's gross domestic product. Supporters say it would offer a clear alternative to Beijing's export-controls and Washington's tariff blitzkrieg, while detractors say it will undermine both environmental regulations and the EU's iconic agricultural sector.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said ahead of the Brussels summit that the EU's global status would be dented by a delay or scrapping of the deal.

“If the European Union wants to remain credible in global trade policy, then decisions must be made now,” Merz said.

The deal is also about strategic competition between Western nations and China over Latin America, said Agathe Demarais, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “A failure to sign the EU-Mercosur free trade agreement risks pushing Latin American economies closer to Beijing's orbit,” she said.

Von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa are scheduled to sign the deal in Brazil on Saturday.

South America's agitation over the delays

The political tensions that have marked Mercosur in recent years – especially between Argentina's far-right President Javier Milei and Brazil's centre-left Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the bloc's two main partners – have not altered the willingness of South American leaders to seal an alliance with Europe that will result in benefits for their agricultural sector.

Lula has been one of the most fervent promoters of the agreement from South America's largest economy. As host of the upcoming summit, the Brazilian president is betting on closing the deal Saturday and scoring a major diplomatic achievement ahead of next year's general elections, in which he will seek re-election.

At a cabinet meeting Wednesday, Lula was clearly irked by Italy and France's positions. He said that Saturday would be a make-or-break moment for the deal.

“If we don't do it now, Brazil won't make any more agreements while I'm president,” Lula said, adding that the agreement would “defend multilateralism” as Trump pursues unilateralism.

Milei, a close ideological ally of Trump, also supports the deal.

“We must stop thinking of Mercosur as a shield that protects us from the world and start thinking of it as a spear that allows us to effectively penetrate global markets,” he said some time ago.

Louvre workers voted to extend a strike as security scrutiny at the world famous museum intensifies.

France's Louvre Museum partially reopened on Wednesday despite a vote by employees to extend a strike that has disrupted operations at the world's most visited museum.

""The museum is open, but some areas are not accessible due to the industrial action,"" a spokeswoman said.

A strike and protest by workers forced the Louvre to close on Monday, disappointing thousands of would-be visitors.

The CGT and CFDT unions say the recent high-profile heist at the museum has highlighted long-simmering employee discontent. Issues include staff shortages, aging infrastructure, and a planned increase in ticket prices for non-European visitors.

Culture Ministry officials held crisis talks with unions on Monday and proposed canceling a planned $6.7 million (€5.7 million) cut to 2026 funding, opening new recruitment for gallery guards and visitor services, and increasing staff compensation.

On Wednesday, the CGT union said the measures were ""insufficient and unacceptable.""

Louvre President Laurence des Cars is set to testify before the French Senate's culture committee later Wednesday as lawmakers continue investigating security lapses at the museum.

Des Cars has admitted to an ""institutional failure"" in the wake of the heist and faces renewed criticism after revealing she only became aware of a key 2019 security audit following the robbery.

Despite the continuing strike, tourists lined up outside the Louvre, hoping to be allowed in to see iconic works like Leonardo da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa.""

""What about tourists' rights? It's shameful,"" one man shouted as union leaders spoke to journalists after Wednesday's vote.

Others were more understanding.

""It's frustrating, right, because we've come all the way from Canada, and we've come early, you try to make sure that you're doing everything correct,"" Jesse Henry, a mechanic visiting the French capital with wife and children, told French news agency AFP. 

""But I also understand that it's a demonstration.""

The footage was grainy but unmistakable: US marines fast-roping from a black hawk helicopter onto the deck of an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela.

Seizing the vessel, one of Caracas' sanctioned “ghost ships” illegally shipping crude oil, was the prelude to the second act of Donald Trump's campaign to topple Nicolas Maduro.

Within days, the US president announced a full naval blockade designed to sever the Venezuelan president's economic lifeline and compel his loyal inner circle to oust him.

“Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the history of South America. It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before,” Mr Trump declared on Tuesday.

Insiders see the move as a creative new calculus aimed at starving Mr Maduro's government, whose survival depends on selling crude oil abroad, while simultaneously forcing his allies in Moscow and Beijing to abandon him.

“The White House is committed to the effort against the regime and seeing Maduro ousted,” a source close to the administration said.

This is the plan behind Mr Trump's unprecedented blockade and the campaign the White House hopes rids Venezuela of its global influence.

Perched in his presidential office in Miraflores Palace, Mr Maduro has relied on the export of Venezuela's vast oil reserves to prop up his country.

Beneath him lies more crude oil than Saudi Arabia, Russia or the United States and the mineral, dubbed “liquid gold”, accounts for about 88 per cent of Venezuela's $24bn in exports.

Since 2019, Mr Trump has sought to stop that.

In his first term, the US Treasury sanctioned Venezuela's state oil company, PDVSA, and threatened secondary sanctions on any entity doing business with it.

To get around this, Mr Maduro's government has turned to a clandestine “dark fleet” of tankers to evade sanctions and keep oil flowing to buyers in China, Russia and Cuba.

Hundreds of ageing tankers now smuggle sanctioned oil, acting as a financial lifeline to Caracas. As of late November, more than 30 of the 80 ships in Venezuelan waters or approaching the country were under US sanctions.

It is a growing phenomenon. Financial intelligence firm S&P Global estimates that one in five oil tankers worldwide are used to smuggle oil from sanctioned countries.

The tactic appears to be working. Despite international pressure, oil exports rose to some 921,000 barrels per day in November, the third-highest monthly average so far this year.

By seizing the vessels, the Trump administration is attempting to sever Mr Maduro's main source of revenue that keeps his regime afloat while tightening the economic noose.

“What they're doing is essentially trying to cut off any remaining source of revenue for the government, to try to rattle the government into changing the regime,” said Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House.

By choking oil revenue, the White House aims to isolate Mr Maduro's government to the point where he is forced to resign or to spark an uprising from his disgruntled allies.

Indeed, oil tanker seizures are viewed by experts as the final act in Mr Trump's chapter of maximum pressure that began with sanctions years before.

“The revenue that is coming in from oil is something that the regime has long since used as a tool to buy influence within the military and maintain what little the government still is able to produce in the form of oil,” Andrés Martínez-Fernández, senior policy analyst for Latin America at the Allison Centre for National Security, explained.

“It's very quickly going to create instability to a new level within Venezuela and the regime.”

Relations between Washington and Caracas are at a nadir. The US and many of its allies consider Mr Maduro, who is currently serving his disputed third term, as a dictator.

Yet thanks to the export of Venezuela's oil, Mr Maduro has formed a network of loyal military commanders and international allies who keep his reign afloat.

None have become more important than China, which is the biggest buyer of Venezuelan oil, taking roughly 80 per cent of its exports. Every day it imports around 746,000 barrels of oil.

Beijing has taken the oil not as a commercial import but as debt repayment towards an estimated $60bn in loans it has poured into Venezuelan oil projects.

The repayment deal suited both sides. Beijing secured oil while Maduro gained time and a friend on the international stage.

The blockade now threatens to derail the relationship and turn China against Mr Maduro as the ghost fleet of tankers stop arriving in Beijing's ports.

If Venezuelan oil can no longer be delivered reliably, then Mr Maduro ceases to be an asset to China and becomes a legal liability as it chases repayment.

“Once shipments stop arriving at foreign ports, the debts start getting called in. And that's going to have an immediate impact. Things are going to start breaking down quickly, physical infrastructure, if these payments don't start to come in,” Mr Martínez-Fernández explained.

“It could get to a point where China says, ‘we would be better off being rid of this headache and being rid of Maduro, then by continuing any kind of active support.”

Beijing has shown little sympathy to similar situations in the past. In Africa and Central Asia, the state has repeatedly distanced itself from leaders it no longer sees as reliable partners.

For Mr Trump, the blockade is another step in his plan dubbed the “Donroe Doctrine” by insiders, which aims to rid America's backyard of Chinese influence.

Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation doctrine long believed to be a blueprint for his second term, calls it “re-hemisphering”. It calls for the capture of supply chains in the region as a requirement of US economic security.

In that sense, the blockade is not aimed at confronting China head on but at making Mr Maduro persona non grata. If the oil-for-debt deal collapses, Beijing may consider switching horses and abandoning him.

Also in the crosshairs is Havana, which has long relied on subsidised Venezuelan oil.

Cuba, which has been the subject of its own US blockade, has been receiving some 24,000 barrels of crude, gasoline and jet fuel per day from the regime.

Mr Sabatini said the blockade will be “catastrophic” for Cuba, a historic enemy of the US, and estimates that exports will drop dramatically.

“This is the moment that people like Marco Rubio [the secretary of state] and Cuban-American hardliners living in Florida have been waiting for,” he said.

“They're trying to starve the government. By doing that, then they actually starve the people too.”

While China has poured millions into Venezuelan oil projects, Russia has been a key enabler in the shadows.

A Russian-linked “dark fleet” of tankers have also helped Mr Maduro avoid sanctions by shipping his oil around the globe. However, Putin, who has sought to curry favour with Mr Trump since his return to the Oval Office, may redirect the vessels, further isolating Mr Maduro.

Indeed, signs of Moscow's shift in position are already there. Reports from late November suggested that Russia had initiated the evacuation of its citizens from the region.

Experts agree that Mr Trump is attempting to squeeze Mr Maduro economically while testing the resolve of his few remaining allies in the hope they turn against him.

“It does seem to be another way for the administration to ratchet up the pressure against the Maduro government,” said Brian Finucane, a former state department lawyer who is now senior adviser at the International Crisis Group.

The formation of the armada, the largest US military presence in the region in decades, began with a series of strikes on boats the Trump administration claimed were ferrying illegal narcotics to the US.

For months, American forces have launched lethal strikes on small vessels skimming through international waters under the banner of anti-drug operations.

US navy and coastguard units have destroyed around 20 boats since early September, killing over 90 people.

Eight warships, including three destroyers, three amphibious assault ships, a cruiser and a smaller littoral combat ship now make up the largest US military presence in the region in decades.

They are joined by a squadron of F-35B Lightning II jets and a handful of Reaper drones, which are capable of flying long distances and carrying up to eight laser-guided missiles. B-2 bombers have also been spotted flying off the coast.

It has led many Venezuelans, and many Americans, to believe that Mr Trump is preparing for war.

The blockade, insiders suggest, is one of the lesser military escalations the president had been weighing with his cabinet in recent weeks.

Instead, they hope to turn the very cartels that military officials say are complicit in the smuggling of fentanyl to the US, against their leader by choking their cash flow, which is used to finance them.

For the armed forces, oil revenue is the glue that keeps the system intact. Generals control ports, customs and fuel distribution, making the military a pillar of Mr Maduro's power.

As long as Mr Maduro can afford to pay his generals, their unfettered loyalty and in turn, his regime, will continue.

The same logic applies to Mr Maduro's alleged relationship with organised crime. These groups rely on access to ports and laundering routes, all of which are sustained by the cash generated by oil sales.

“It doesn't take us yet to the place where we're going into Venezuelan territory and conducting military strikes. We're still talking about operations in international waters,” Mr Martínez-Fernández said.

The formation of the armada, coupled with Mr Trump's continued threat of land strikes, have led experts to believe that the blockade is part of a slide towards conflict.

Top military officials are said to have presented the US president with options for military intervention in the region which include land strikes. Other options reported to have been drawn up by the Pentagon include direct attacks on Mr Maduro's security detail or operations to seize the country's oil fields.

Recommended

In each, Mr Trump is said to be against ideas that may place American troops at risk or could turn into an embarrassing failure.

Mr Trump and his cabinet have begun framing the blockade as a necessary intervention to reclaim “American oil”.

So what is stopping him? Perhaps his thirst for the Nobel Peace Prize and the potential blowback amongst his America First base if he started a war.

What happens next will be determined by Mr Trump's blockade. If oil flow continues, Mr Maduro survives.

But if it is stopped, China may decide the debt is not worth collecting and his cash-poor lieutenants may turn against him.

The gamble in Washington is simple; regimes do not fall when they are attacked but when they are abandoned.

    CNN gets rare access inside a packed Border Patrol Academy. Upgrade to watch the full report.



            In the desert of New Mexico, under wide open skies, the US Border Patrol is bulking up. A record number of recruits, many Latino, Spanish-speaking, and from border towns they know well, are heading to the agency's training academy, where more assertive tactics, including vehicle pursuit training, have been added back into the curriculum.
    


            Better weapons technology is also being introduced as part of a surge that Border Patrol leaders say reflects a broader reset under President Donald Trump's second term.
    


            After months of requests, CNN was granted rare access inside the Border Patrol Academy in Artesia, New Mexico, as a series of operational and training changes were coming into force, reflecting new priorities that academy officials said they had long wanted. The changes also come at a time when Trump is pushing hard on his promise to deport undocumented immigrants, which has seen Border Patrol officers sent to cities away from the border and drawing backlash from immigrant advocates, some state officials and Democrats on Capitol Hill.
    


            On the day CNN visited the academy in late September, hundreds of recruits lined up in their green uniforms for morning inspection, and they heard from then-acting Deputy Chief of the US Border Patrol, Scott Good, in town from DC headquarters.
    


            “You all are a tremendous part of national security. And we sincerely appreciate that you've taken the first step and that you signed up,” he told the crowd. “It's not an easy job, but it's a rewarding job … and America loves you for it.”
    


            Driving simulators are now running regularly, and vehicle pursuit training has been reintroduced and expanded both in the simulators and on the driving tracks at the sprawling 3,700-acre complex that spans two campuses. Chief Jared Ashby, who oversaw the academy during CNN's visit and has since become chief patrol agent of the Rio Grande Valley, said that's a clear change.
    


            “I believe smugglers were incentivized by our last pursuit policy. We would let them go so they knew that the Border Patrol would not pursue them,” Ashby said. While chases were not banned, officers were required to consider dangers to the public following a string of fatal crashes, and there had to be reasonable suspicion the vehicle had already failed to obey a law. Under the Trump administration, using vehicles to make arrests has become a clear tactic.
    


            The new rules also mean several hundred agents who graduated under the Biden administration are being brought back to the academy for refresher courses, having never been trained in offensive driving under earlier guidelines, Ashby told CNN.
    


            “In my approximately 20 years working in government, this is the fastest I've ever seen government move,” he said, adding the changes were welcomed by many in the agency.
    


            Weapons training has also been updated. Agents now use miniature red dot sights that project a red dot onto a target while giving the agent better peripheral vision, a tool officials say improves accuracy and situational awareness. Academy firearms instructor Agent Jeremy David described the technology as a game changer, saying graduation success rates have increased, with more recruits getting better shooting scores.
    


            Leaders of Customs and Border Protection say Trump's “big, beautiful bill” is paying for updated training procedures tied to the revised pursuit policy, expanded firing range capacity, new firearms technology, and funding to hire roughly 3,000 additional Border Patrol agents, on top of the more than 19,000 already serving nationwide.
    


            When we visited, about 1,100 trainees were enrolled at the academy, the highest since 2009, officials said. CBP data underscores how quickly that growth is happening: just over 500 trainees were enrolled on October 1, 2024; that has already doubled and the agency says it aims to have about 1,500 trainees by June 2026.
    


            Ashby said the campus is also undergoing physical upgrades to support the growing population, including additional barracks, updated fitness centers, and nutrition planning tailored to recruits' training demands.
    


            To sustain that growth, CBP has intensified recruiting efforts nationwide, targeting a broad pool of candidates.
    


            At an event outside Fort Hood, near Killeen, Texas, recruiters pitched Border Patrol as a natural next step for servicemembers preparing to leave the military. Standing under a tent, they spoke with soldiers in uniform, some accompanied by spouses and young children, outlining signing bonuses, career stability, and paid leave.
    


            Servicemembers passing by described different motivations for considering Border Patrol.
    


            Pfc. Leroy Williams said his interest centers on stopping the flow of drugs into the US..
    


            “That's what I want to get rid of,” he said, pointing to fentanyl as a major concern.
    


            Staff Sgt. Nico Vardouniotis described the mission more broadly, saying Border Patrol work is about “helping, assisting immigrants coming into the country” while also enforcing the law. He said he sees the role as “two-sided,” balancing security and humanitarian responsibilities.
    


            The recruiting efforts appear to be drawing interest. CBP recorded 72,448 applicants in fiscal year 2023 and 61,913 in fiscal year 2024. In fiscal year 2025, applications rose sharply to 103,414.
    


            Back at the academy, the makeup of one classroom offered a snapshot of who is filling those ranks. About 30 recruits sat at their desks preparing to run through a simulation. When asked who was fluent in Spanish, a little more than half the class raised their hands. When asked who grew up in a border community, nearly every recruit's hand went up.
    


            CBP says its most recent data shows about half of US Border Patrol agents serving along the southwest border are Hispanic or Latino.
    


            For many of these recruits, the border is not an abstract concept. It is home.
    


            In El Paso, Texas, Border Patrol is a constant presence, and residents describe the agency as deeply embedded in daily life.
    


            Across the Rio Grande and the border with Mexico is Ciudad Juarez, and locals say the two cities remain closely connected.
    


            “We don't see people from (Ciudad Juarez) as illegals, we see them as family,” said David Villa, celebrating his 67th birthday with his grandchildren at L&J Cafe, a longtime local staple.
    


            And there are connections with Border Patrol too, residents say.
    


            “We have friends whose older siblings are in Border Patrol or are going into Border Patrol,” said Zipporah Rios, sitting in El Paso's 787 Coffee shop.
    


            Her friend Angie Prado chimed in, “I have a cousin that's in Georgia doing the training … to do Border Patrol and then come back here.”
    


            Residents distinguish between the Border Patrol they know locally and images they see elsewhere, particularly when Border Patrol agents are called to support other agents under the Department of Homeland Security. Typically, customs and immigration officers handle arrivals at official ports of entry, Border Patrol agents cover the border between those points, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) staff work in the rest of the country. In recent months, Border Patrol agents have increasingly been deployed to support deportation policies away from the border.
    


            “From what I have seen on social media, like in Chicago, in California, that definitely doesn't look like something our Border Patrol would be doing or how they would be behaving,” Prado said.
    


            “I don't think they've ever done that,” added Kenneth Quinonez, seemingly surprised by the images showing clashes between Border Patrol and migrants they're apprehending in other parts of the country.
    


            But elsewhere in El Paso, fear is shaping daily life for some.
    


            One family with mixed immigration statuses, is largely staying inside their home, even as they confront a medical crisis. The father has a rare and aggressive form of cancer.
    


            “It's called Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia. It's super rare, very rare form of cancer,” his daughter said, asking we not use her or her family's names for fear of being reported to immigration officials. “And he has one (tumor) between the lungs and (another) surrounding the heart, it's like a melon size.”
    


            She said fear kept him from seeking treatment sooner.
    


            “I think the tumor could've been extracted so he could've had a better quality of life for sure.”
    


            Now, options are limited.
    


            “The only thing that he's receiving right now is medication management for pain, but there's no more hope for him … He's basically dying before our eyes.”
    


            The family said they are trying to hold onto a sense of shared humanity, including for those who may have been tasked with removing them.
    


            “We see (Border Patrol) as human, and we wish they could see us as human too. Somos los mismos — we're all one community at the end of the day.”
    


            Border Patrol agents say their mission centers on national security but also includes humanitarian efforts. CBP points to its rescue and mortality data and specialized units like BORSTAR, which conduct search and rescue operations in dangerous terrain, as examples of how enforcement can also involve saving lives.
    


            Hoping to provide some legal protections for her parents, the mixed status family's youngest child, the only US citizen, joined the Army Reserves.
    


            “There's definitely a lot of pressure. A lot of guilt,” she said. “But you have to do what you have to do for your family at the end of the day.”
    


            Agent Claudio Herrera patrols the El Paso sector. Born and raised in Mexico, he says he first came to the US as a student on an F1 visa and later became a citizen.
    


            “To me it's an honor to wear this uniform every single day,” Herrera said. “We're able to wear this badge to protect and safeguard the country that welcomed me.”
    


            He said the process to lawfully naturalize took time, “easily, 10 to 11 years.”
    


            Herrera said he believes enforcement and empathy are not mutually exclusive.
    


            “My deepest advice to anybody that is coming from Mexico,” he said. “If you really want to follow that journey, do it the legal way because you will find good, you will find life.”
    


            He also offered a warning.
    


            “But if you decide to do it illegally, you will only find jail or you only find death.”

STATESVILLE, N.C. (AP) — A business jet with six people aboard crashed Thursday at a regional airport in North Carolina used by NASCAR teams and Fortune 500 companies, erupting in a large fire and killing multiple people, authorities said.




“I can confirm there were fatalities,” Iredell County Sheriff Darren Campbell said.

There were six people on the Cessna C550 that crashed while landing at Statesville Regional Airport, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Charlotte, the Federal Aviation Administration said. 

Golfers playing next to the airport were shocked as they witnessed the disaster, even dropping to the ground at the Lakewood Golf Club while the plane was overhead. The ninth hole was covered with debris.

“We were like, ‘Oh my gosh! That's way too low,'” said Joshua Green of Mooresville. “It was scary.”

The National Transportation Safety Board and the FAA were investigating. AccuWeather says there was some drizzle and clouds at the time of the crash.

The plane took off from the airport shortly after 10 a.m. but then returned and was attempting to land there, according to tracking data posted by FlightAware.com.

The plane had planned to fly later from Sarasota, Florida, to Treasure Cay International Airport in the Bahamas before returning to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and then to Statesville by evening, data showed.

Video from WSOC-TV showed first responders rushing onto the runway as flames burned near scattered wreckage from the plane.

The airport's website states that it offers corporate aviation facilities for Fortune 500 companies and several NASCAR teams.

VIENNA (AP) — In the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion earlier this year that the U.S. would resume nuclear testing, a U.S. government representative defended the stance at a global nuclear arms control meeting and pointed to nuclear provocations from Russia, China and North Korea.

U.S. Chargé d'Affaires to the International Organizations in Vienna Howard Solomon made the previously unpublished comments, which were obtained by The Associated Press, at the Preparatory Commission of the Vienna-based Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization on Nov. 10. 

“As President Trump indicated, the United States will begin testing activities on an equal basis with other nuclear-armed states. This process will begin immediately and proceed in a manner fully consistent with our commitment to transparency and national security,” Solomon said.

Solomon provided further explanation by noting, “For any who question this decision, context is important. Since 2019, including in this forum, the United States has raised concerns that Russia and China have not adhered to the zero-yield nuclear test moratorium,” he said, adding that the concerns “remain valid.”

Solomon's comment referred to so-called supercritical nuclear test explosions banned under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, known as CTBT, where fissile material is compressed to start a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction that creates an explosion. 

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




The explosive tests produce an amount of energy released, referred to as nuclear yield, which defines a weapon's destructive power. The treaty bans any nuclear explosion with a yield, even a very small one, following a zero-yield standard.




“Our concerns with Russia and China are in addition to the activities of North Korea, which has conducted six nuclear explosive tests this century,” Solomon said.

The global monitoring network established alongside the treaty in 1996 to register nuclear tests worldwide has detected all of North Korea's six nuclear tests this century. Those were tests with larger yields.

However, the monitoring network is unable to detect very low-yield supercritical nuclear tests conducted underground in metal chambers, experts say.

The U.S. State Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment on whether Solomon was referring to low-yield supercritical nuclear tests.

China and Russia, which have signed but not ratified the treaty, say they adhere to a nuclear testing moratorium. 

But since 2019, the U.S. State Department has publicly expressed concerns about China and Russia not adhering to their zero-yield testing moratoria. Annual reports on compliance with arms control agreements to the U.S. Congress cite possible activities at the Lop Nur nuclear testing site in the Xinjiang region of northwestern China and Russia's Novaya Zemlya site, a remote Arctic archipelago.

In an interview for “60 Minutes” that aired Nov. 2 on CBS News, Trump said, “Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it. You know, we're a open society. We're different. We talk about it.”

“They don't go and tell you about it,” Trump continued. “You know, as powerful as they are, this is a big world. You don't necessarily know where they're testing. They — they test way under — underground where people don't know exactly what's happening with the test.”

A White House official, asked for comment on whether Trump was referring to low-yield supercritical nuclear tests conducted underground, said the president had directed tests be done “on an equal basis” to other countries. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record about the testing plans.

Other countries have accelerated their testing programs and Trump wants to act accordingly, the official said without providing further details.

Solomon's comments in Vienna came in response to Russia's Permanent Representative to the International Organizations, Mikhail Ulyanov, at a closed-door meeting of the Preparatory Commission of the CTBTO, an international body based in Vienna that monitors compliance with the nuclear test ban. 

“The resumption of nuclear testing could cause significant damage to the nuclear non-proliferation regime and international security,” Ulyanov said. 

“We consider it fundamentally important that the U.S. side provide a clear and detailed explanation of its position on the resumption of nuclear testing,” he added. “We expect the U.S. to respond appropriately and without further delay.”

Ulyanov also rejected the “completely unacceptable and unsubstantiated allegations” that Russia is conducting nuclear tests. 

“These are false accusations. We consider such escalatory rhetoric unacceptable,” he said.

Solomon refuted Ulyanov's comments, saying it is “surprising to hear such statements coming from a state that has not adhered to the zero-yield nuclear test moratorium.”

Solomon then cited additional U.S. concerns, including Russia's “ongoing violations” of New START, the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between Moscow and Washington, Russia's “disproportionately large” stockpile of non-strategic nuclear weapons and Russian nuclear doctrine. 

The weapons referred to by Solomon generally have a lower explosive power than strategic nuclear weapons and are designed for use on the battlefield. They can still cause immense destruction.

Despite being physically smaller, experts consider nonstrategic nuclear weapons dangerous because the threshold for use is considered lower. The weapons are not covered by arms control treaties, making development easier for Russia and other states without oversight or limits.

The Nuclear Notebook, a renowned annual report published by the Federation of American Scientists in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, highlighted this point in this year's edition.

“Of particular concern is the role that nonstrategic nuclear weapons play because it may be this category of nuclear weapon that would be used first in a potential military escalation with NATO,” the report said.

Russia has between 1,000 and 2,000 nonstrategic nuclear warheads as of the latest unclassified assessment in 2023, according to the U.S. State Department, far more than the approximately 200 such weapons the U.S. maintains.

By contrast, strategic nuclear weapons are even more powerful and are designed to be used deep inside an enemy's territory, far away from the actual battlefield where friendly forces may be located and risk being killed.

The U.S. and Russia have a comparable total number of deployed strategic nuclear weapons, with 1,718 for Moscow and 1,770 for Washington, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

These weapons are capped by New START, formally known as the Treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. It was signed by the Obama administration in 2010 and took effect in February 2011 as a 10-year agreement.

Russia suspended its participation in New START in 2023 but did not withdraw from the treaty. Russian President Vladimir Putin in September declared Moscow's readiness to adhere to the treaty's limits for one more year.

Trump said in October it sounded “like a good idea.”

Without the treaty, which will expire Feb. 5, the U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals would be unconstrained for the first time in decades.

The eight arms sales agreements announced Wednesday cover 82 high-mobility artillery rocket systems, or HIMARS, and 420 Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS — similar to what the U.S. had been providing Ukraine during the Biden administration to defend itself from Russia — worth more than $4 billion. They also include 60 self-propelled howitzer systems and related equipment worth more than $4 billion and drones valued at more than $1 billion.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's administration has announced a massive package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion that includes medium-range missiles, howitzers and drones, drawing an angry response from China.

The State Department announced the sales late Wednesday during a nationally televised address by the Republican president, who made scant mention of foreign policy issues and did not speak about China or Taiwan. U.S.-Chinese tensions have ebbed and flowed during Trump's second term, largely over trade and tariffs but also over China's increasing aggressiveness toward Taiwan, which Beijing has said must reunify with the mainland.

If approved by Congress, it would be the largest-ever U.S. weapons package to Taiwan, exceeding the total amount of $8.4 billion in U.S. arms sales to Taiwan during President Joe Biden's Democratic administration. 

The eight arms sales agreements announced Wednesday cover 82 high-mobility artillery rocket systems, or HIMARS, and 420 Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS — similar to what the U.S. had been providing Ukraine during the Biden administration to defend itself from Russia — worth more than $4 billion. They also include 60 self-propelled howitzer systems and related equipment worth more than $4 billion and drones valued at more than $1 billion.

Other sales in the package include military software valued at more than $1 billion, Javelin and TOW missiles worth more than $700 million, helicopter spare parts worth $96 million and refurbishment kits for Harpoon missiles worth $91 million.

The eight sales agreements amount to $11.15 billion, according to Taiwan's Defense Ministry. 




The State Department said the sales serve “U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.”

“The proposed sale(s) will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,” the statements said.

China's Foreign Ministry attacked the move, saying it would violate diplomatic agreements between China and the U.S.; gravely harm China's sovereignty, security and territorial integrity; and undermine regional stability.

“The ‘Taiwan independence' forces on the island seek independence through force and resist reunification through force, squandering the hard-earned money of the people to purchase weapons at the cost of turning Taiwan into a powder keg,” said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun.

“This cannot save the doomed fate of ‘Taiwan independence' but will only accelerate the push of the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war. The U.S. support for ‘Taiwan Independence' through arms will only end up backfiring. Using Taiwan to contain China will not succeed,” he added.

Under federal law, the U.S. is obligated to assist Taiwan with its self-defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China, which has vowed to take Taiwan by force, if necessary.

Taiwan's Defense Ministry in a statement Thursday expressed gratitude to the U.S. over the arms sale, which it said would help Taiwan maintain “sufficient self-defense capabilities” and bring strong deterrent capabilities. Taiwan's bolstering of its defense “is the foundation for maintaining regional peace and stability,” the ministry said.

Taiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung similarly thanked the U.S. for its “long-term support for regional security and Taiwan's self-defense capabilities,” which he said are key for deterring a conflict in the Taiwan Strait, the body of water separating Taiwan from China's mainland.

The arms sale comes as Taiwan's government has pledged to raise defense spending to 3.3% of the island's gross domestic product next year and to reach 5% by 2030. The boost came after Trump and the Pentagon requested that Taiwan spend as much as 10% of its GDP on its defense, a percentage well above what the U.S. or any of its major allies spend on defense. The demand has faced pushback from Taiwan's opposition KMT party and some of its population. 

Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te last month announced a special $40 billion budget for arms purchases, including to build an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called Taiwan Dome. The budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033.

The U.S. boost in military assistance to Taiwan was previewed in legislation adopted by Congress that Trump is expected to sign shortly.

Last week, the Chinese embassy in Washington denounced the legislation, known as the National Defense Authorization Act, saying it unfairly targeted China as an aggressor. The U.S. Senate passed the bill Wednesday.

President Donald Trump attends the dignified transfer of two Iowa National Guardsmen and an interpreter killed in Syria.

The civilian interpreter who was killed in Palmyra, Syria, over the weekend has been identified as Ayad Mansoor Sakat. 

Sakat, 54, was born in Bakhdida, Iraq, and worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army during the Iraq invasion from 2003 to 2007.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday attended a dignified transfer at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware for Sakat and two Iowa National Guard soldiers killed in the attack in Syria.

The Department of the Army identified the soldiers as Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar, 25, of Des Moines, Iowa, and Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard, 29, of Marshalltown, Iowa, who were killed while supporting Operation Inherent Resolve.

The Washington Commanders did not try to hide their game plan for Jaxson Dart — they wanted to ""go out hitting.""

That's what ""Hard Knocks"" cameras caught head coach Dan Quinn telling his team as they prepared to face the New York Giants and the rookie sensation, who has been checked for five concussions and diagnosed with one since the preseason began.

It is no secret that Dart uses his legs as a weapon, but the rookie has probably taken one too many hits. Quinn pointed out a New England Patriots linebacker's crushing blow on Dart two weeks ago in Dart's return from a concussion.

""When he's out here, he is a running back first,"" Quinn said. ""This is a good hit by Christian Elliss on the sideline, all right? He is not looking to go down and get in the slide. We got to go out hitting, fellas.""

Dart scoffed at Quinn's comments, much as he has to other concerns about the hits he has taken this season, stating their game plan is nothing he hasn't seen before.

""I mean, [Georgia coach] Kirby Smart said the exact same thing every time he played against me, so did [former Alabama coach] Nick Saban, so did every coach that I played in college,'' Dart, an Ole Miss alum, said Wednesday after practice, via SNY. ""This is nothing new. This isn't like a new thing that's been brought up in my career.""

JOSH ALLEN REFLECTS ON GROWTH HE'S MADE SINCE JOINING BILLS AND BECOMING EXPECTANT FATHER

Commanders defensive coordinator Joe Whitt Jr. echoed Quinn's sentiments.

""The quarterback is a very competitive dual-threat guy,'' Whitt said in a meeting. ""He will try to run the ball like a running back. He will try to run you over. He will try to stiff-arm. He doesn't really run out of bounds. He doesn't slide a whole bunch. We can get the ball off of him. The ball is life, it is air, and we need it.""

The Commanders went on the road to take down the Giants, 29-21, even with Marcus Mariota at the helm. Dart's 55.6 completion percentage was his lowest mark of the season, but he did run nine times for 63 yards.

The federal government admitted liability for the deadly plane collision in Washington earlier this year, conceding military personnel and government air traffic controllers contributed to the disaster. 

​​In the 209-page filing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the Justice Department wrote that the United States “admits that it owed a duty of care to Plaintiffs, which it breached, thereby proximately causing the tragic accident on January 29, 2025.”

The January collision between an Army Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines commercial plane occurred near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, marking the deadliest plane crash on American soil in more than two decades. The government filing described it as a “wholly avoidable tragedy” that resulted in the deaths of all 67 people on board the two aircraft, which plunged into the Potomac River.

Government lawyers this week admitted that the three-person crew of the Black Hawk helicopter failed to see and avoid the American Airlines jet approaching the airport's runway.

The helicopter pilots “failed to maintain vigilance so as to see and avoid other aircraft and their failure was a cause-infact and proximate cause of the accident,” the filing reads.

Reagan National Airport failed to alert the jet of the approaching helicopter, court filings added.

Government lawyers identified an air traffic controller in the DCA tower as partially to blame, arguing the controller “negligently violated” a Federal Aviation Administration order by “failing to follow the procedures for visual separation” between the helicopter and passenger jet.

The court filings on Wednesday mark the Justice Department's response to the first lawsuit filed by one of the victims' families. Casey Crafton's widow, Rachel, alleged the U.S. government, American Airlines, and PSA Airlines, which operated Flight 5342, failed to see warning signs after more than 30 near-collisions in the area of the airport.

American Airlines and PSA Airlines have filed motions to dismiss the claims targeting them. 

The National Transportation Safety Board considered irregular staffing on the night of the crash to be a contributing factor. As a result, staffing rules at the airport have been tightened.

POTOMAC PLANE CRASH INVESTIGATORS RECOMMEND ‘URGENT' SAFETY CHANGES AFTER FINDING DOZENS OF CLOSE CALLS

Only one air traffic controller was responsible for managing plane and helicopter traffic at the time of the crash in January. The responsibilities were combined an hour earlier in a practice called an “early shove,” which is used when air traffic is light.

During a debate this summer, the NTSB also criticized the Army's failure to issue a broader advisory about the challenges faced by Black Hawk helicopters. There were known issues with the Lima model Black Hawk's barometric altimeter, which resulted in measurements varying between 70 and 100 feet.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts, commonly known as the Kennedy Center, will be renamed the ""Trump-Kennedy Center,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday.

The prestigious Washington, D.C., cultural center's board of trustees, who were appointed by President Donald Trump in February, ""have just voted unanimously"" on the name change, Leavitt said in an X post.

They did so ""because of the unbelievable work President Trump has done over the last year in saving the building,"" Leavitt said.

""Congratulations to President Donald J. Trump, and likewise, congratulations to President Kennedy, because this will be a truly great team long into the future! The building will no doubt attain new levels of success and grandeur,"" she said.

Leavitt's depiction of a center that has been saved ""not only from the standpoint of its reconstruction, but also financially, and its reputation"" contrasts with reporting from multiple news outlets that ticket sales and staffing both have sharply declined this year.

The New York Times reported last month that internal figures showed ticket sales during a typical week in October down by about 50% from the same period a year earlier.

The Washington Post, which analyzed sales data from early September through Oct. 19, found an ""across-the-board drop-off"" in ticket sales for the center's three largest performance spaces.

Trump, who named himself chairman of the Kennedy Center weeks after taking office, signaled in October that the name change was forthcoming.

In a Truth Social post, Trump shared pictures of a newly painted colonnade on the outside of the building below a caption praising ""the new TRUMP KENNEDY, whoops, I mean, KENNEDY CENTER, columns.""

The center was not initially named after Kennedy.

It was created in 1958, when President Dwight Eisenhower signed legislation to ""provide for a National Cultural Center"" in Washington.

In 1962, Eisenhower's successor, Kennedy, and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy led a $30 million fundraising campaign to build the center.

Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963. Two months later, President Lyndon Johnson signed a law renaming the center in honor of the slain president.

In this article

Eli Lilly on Thursday said its closely watched obesity pill helped patients maintain the majority of their weight loss after they switched directly from taking the company's injection Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's rival shot Wegovy in a late-stage trial. 

The company also said it has filed for Food and Drug Administration approval of the daily GLP-1 pill, called orforglipron, for obesity. The FDA in November said it awarded a priority review voucher to that pill, which could expedite its review timeline to a few months. 

Shares of Eli Lilly rose more than 2% on Thursday after the announcement. 

The positive trial data suggests that the pill could be an effective treatment for patients to transition to if they want to preserve their weight loss but don't want to take weekly injections long term. Many people who stop those shots regain much of the weight they initially shed. 

While Eli Lilly's pill appears to cause less weight loss overall than existing injections, Thursday's results highlight its potential role as a needle-free maintenance treatment in the blockbuster GLP-1 market. But an oral pill for obesity from Novo Nordisk will likely enter the market first, giving the Danish drugmaker a head start in staking its claim in the space.

The phase three trial followed more than 300 patients with obesity who previously took Wegovy or  Zepbound for 72 weeks in a separate late-stage study. Those people were then randomized to take either Eli Lilly's pill or a placebo for another 52 weeks. The oral drug met the trial's main goal of demonstrating superior weight loss maintenance compared with a placebo, among people who previously experienced a plateau in their progress while taking the injections. 

On average, patients who switched to the pill from Novo Nordisk's Wegovy only regained roughly 2 pounds of the weight they initially lost by the end of the trial. Meanwhile, on average, people who switched to the pill from Zepbound only regained around 11 pounds of the weight they initially lost by the end of the study. 

That means people in the Wegovy group maintained about 95% of their weight loss after switching, while those in the Zepbound group maintained roughly 80%. 

""Obesity is a chronic, progressive disease, and sustaining weight loss remains a significant challenge for many,"" said Kenneth Custer, president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, in a release. 

He said the trial showed that the pill ""helped people maintain the weight they worked hard to lose"" and that, if approved, it could ""provide a convenient alternative for the millions of individuals living with obesity around the globe to continue their long-term health journey.""

While people in the Zepbound group appeared to regain more weight, the bigger focus is likely on those who transitioned from the drug's top competitor, Wegovy. 

In an October note, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said positive results from the trial could give Eli Lilly ""the unique opportunity to capture revenue share"" from chronic treatment with semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and diabetes injection Ozempic. 

""Chipping away at the potential for Novo's flagship product,"" Seigerman wrote. 

In a note on Thursday, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said the data ""will help drive commercial success and upside to consensus expectations"" for Eli Lilly's pill. He said the firm expects the drug to rake in $2 billion in sales by the end of 2026, $9 billion by the end of 2027 and $16 billion by the end of 2028. 

Dr. Caroline Apovian, co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women's Hospital, said the results were ""still great"" even though patients regained some of the weight they lost. 

But she said, ""in order for this to be a good switch, these orals are going to have to be less expensive for the insurance companies to cover than the injectables, right?"" Obesity injections currently carry list prices of roughly $1,000 per month before insurance, though both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have cut the direct-to-consumer prices of their drugs for cash-paying patients. 

It's unclear how the companies will price their respective pills. But under recent deals with President Donald Trump, the companies said starting doses of their upcoming oral drugs, pending approvals, will be $149 per month for everyone getting them through the direct-to-consumer website TrumpRx. That site launches in January. 

The overall safety and tolerability – or how well patients handle treatment – of the pill were consistent with previous late-stage studies. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal related and generally mild to moderate in severity. 

Around 4.8% of people who switched to the pill from Wegovy discontinued treatment due to side effects, while 7.2% of those who switched to the oral drug from Zepbound did the same. Meanwhile, those rates were 7.6% and 6.3% among patients who switched to a placebo from Wegovy and Zepbound, respectively. 

No liver safety issues were observed, according to Eli Lilly. Full results of the trial, called ATTAIN-MAINTAIN, will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and published in a peer-reviewed journal next year. 

Eli Lilly's pill works in a similar way to Wegovy, Ozempic and Novo Nordisk's diabetes pill Rybelsus, targeting a gut hormone called GLP-1 to suppress a person's appetite and regulate blood sugar. Novo Nordisk is also seeking approval of an oral version of Wegovy for obesity, which could come by year-end.

But unlike those three treatments, Eli Lilly's pill is not a peptide medication. That means it is absorbed more easily by the body and does not require dietary restrictions like Rybelsus or oral Wegovy does.

In a note in August, Goldman Sachs analysts forecast that pills will capture a 24% share — or around $22 billion — of the 2030 global weight loss drug market, which they expect to be worth $95 billion in total.

They said they expect Eli Lilly's pill to have a 60% share — or roughly $13.6 billion — of the daily oral segment of the market in 2030. They expect Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide to have a 21% share — or around $4 billion — of that segment.

Fold now offers Bitcoin services nationwide via its partnership with federally chartered BitGo Bank & Trust.

Fold Holdings, Inc. ($FLD), a publicly traded Bitcoin financial services company, just announced that its platform is now available in all 50 U.S. states.

The expansion follows a strategic partnership with BitGo Bank & Trust, which recently became one of the first digital asset companies to secure a federal bank charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).

The move marks a rare milestone in U.S. consumer Bitcoin services: Fold is the first platform to operate nationwide under a single federally supervised trust framework. 

Previously, state-by-state licensing and regulatory barriers constrained consumer access, particularly in states like New York. With BitGo's charter, Fold can now provide Bitcoin exchange and custody services across the entire country, including historically restrictive markets, this is according to the company's statement shared with Bitcoin Magazine. 

“BitGo B&T's federal bank charter combined with Fold's Bitcoin financial products gives the U.S. its first true national framework for Bitcoin access,” said CEO Will Reeves. “It replaces a patchwork of state rules with a single, regulated structure, creating a clear path forward for both companies and consumers.” 

Reeves emphasized that nationwide availability allows the company to scale its offerings and deliver Bitcoin products in line with federal oversight.

The company's consumer-facing products include its Bitcoin Gift Card™ and the upcoming Fold Bitcoin Credit Card™, which will now reach previously untapped markets. 

BitGo provides the digital asset infrastructure through its Crypto-as-a-Service platform, enabling them to operate within a federally supervised compliance framework while continuing to innovate in rewards, payments, and custody services.

“This is a meaningful moment for both BitGo B&T and Fold,” said Frank Wang, Executive Director of Fintech Sales at BitGo. “Our conversion to a federal bank charter allows us to support consumer platforms at a national level, and Fold is a natural partner in that effort. Access has been limited by geography, but with a national framework, both companies can now operate as intended — responsibly and across the entire U.S.”

This partnership positions FLD to capture a wider audience while aligning consumer crypto services with federal standards. At the same time, reliance on BitGo introduces dependencies: any regulatory or operational issues at BitGo could affect the company's nationwide offering. 

Fold is beginning to onboard users nationwide, the company said, with details of product availability to be shared as the rollout progresses.

        Share    

Ethereum price breaks below the $3,000 psychological level and the point of control, increasing the risk of capitulation as bearish structure and downside liquidity targets remain intact.

Ethereum (ETH) price is facing renewed downside pressure after losing the critical $3,000 psychological support level, a zone that also aligned with the market's Point of Control (POC). This breakdown marks a shift in market structure, as $3,000 now transitions from support into resistance.

With price failing to reclaim this region on a closing basis, bearish momentum remains firmly in control, increasing the probability of a deeper corrective move.

The loss of $3,000 represents more than just a psychological setback for Ethereum. This level previously acted as a major area of balance, where significant trading volume accumulated. Its failure on a closing basis signals a clear shift away from equilibrium and toward renewed downside exploration.

Since breaking below the Point of Control, Ethereum has attempted minor relief rallies. However, these moves have been rejected almost “to the dollar,” reinforcing $3,000 as a firm resistance zone. From a technical standpoint, this behavior suggests that buyers lack the capacity to regain control. 

At the same time, sellers continue to defend lower prices aggressively, a dynamic that increases downside risk for BMNR stock as Ethereum's technical pattern becomes more concerning.

The broader market structure remains decisively bearish. Ethereum continues to print lower highs and lower lows, a classic definition of a sustained downtrend. Within this context, the current low-time-frame rally is best viewed as another lower high, rather than the start of a meaningful reversal. Such corrective bounces are common during downtrends and often precede further downside rather than sustained recoveries.

One of the most important factors increasing capitulation risk is the presence of resting liquidity below current price levels. Since Ethereum established a local low near the $2,600 region, liquidity has steadily built beneath that area. Markets tend to seek out these liquidity pools, especially when bearish momentum remains intact and structural support levels fail.

The next major downside target sits near $2,500, a high-time-frame support region that aligns with previous consolidation and structural demand. A move into this area would likely clear out remaining downside liquidity, a process often associated with capitulation-style price action. Capitulation typically involves accelerated selling, forced liquidations, and emotional exits, marking the final phase of a corrective move.

From a price-action perspective, Ethereum's behavior below $3,000 reflects acceptance rather than rejection. Price is consolidating below the resistance level instead of reclaiming it, which statistically favors a continuation of the decline. Prolonged consolidation below a broken key level often increases, rather than reduces, the probability of a decisive downside move.

Volume dynamics further support this view. Recent downside moves have exhibited greater participation than upside attempts, indicating that sell-side pressure remains dominant. Until Ethereum can reclaim $3,000 with substantial volume and hold above it, bullish scenarios remain secondary.

That said, capitulation zones often create conditions for longer-term stabilization once liquidity is fully cleared. While the immediate outlook remains bearish, traders should closely monitor how the price behaves if and when Ethereum approaches the $2,500 region, as strong reactions there could signal exhaustion of selling pressure.

As long as Ethereum remains below the $3,000 psychological level and the Point of Control, downside risk remains elevated. Continued consolidation beneath this region increases the likelihood of a capitulation move toward $2,500, where the next major support and liquidity zone is located.

Crypto Dogecoin in front of a $20 US banknote.



At best, most Americans are skeptical about cryptocurrency (Pew recently reported that 63% of Americans have little confidence in crypto's reliability and safety). But that hasn't stopped crypto from becoming a staple in the investing world, with the global market value of cryptocurrency leaping 36% in 2024. So, if you're hoping to join the ranks of the 562 million people who are crypto owners worldwide, it helps to go into your investment with eyes wide open to scams and risks. And one of the biggest of all? Rug pulls.

Here, Spokeo digs into what rug pulls are, how they affect the sector at large, and what you can do to avoid falling victim to one.

Since it first broke into the mainstream in 2018 (it's been available since around 2009), crypto has become central to the online scam artist's repertoire, especially in popular grifts like online and over-the-phone phishing, catphishing, and identity theft. Scammers like to target crypto as it's difficult to trace; there's no centralized banking authority to flag suspicious transactions, and unlike most bank transfers, crypto transfers can't be reversed. And the problem is so widespread that consumers around the world reportedly lost $2.2 billion to crypto scams in 2024, 21% more than they did in 2021.

Despite their popularity, those day-to-day scams aren't crypto rug pulls, but rug pulls rely on many of the same elements — namely, crypto's lack of traceability and centralized accountability.

In a crypto rug pull, a person or group accrues assets from the public by selling a token (that's crypto's digital representation of assets — the “currency” in cryptocurrency), commonly promising a big return on investment, or even exclusive rewards and other incentives for investing. Once they've scooped up tons of assets from those token investments, they suddenly shut the project down entirely and often “coincidentally” disappear from public view at the same time. This, of course, leaves them holding a great big bag of money while their victims have nothing to show for it but piles of worthless tokens. The rug has been pulled out from under them in one swift motion.

Crypto rug pulls generally follow the same cadence of “gather assets and unceremoniously bail,” but they do vary in terms of execution. Crypto rug pulls typically fall into one of these categories:

For those unfamiliar, NFT stands for non-fungible token, which are digital assets like visual art, videos, and other content that have been tokenized via a blockchain. More simply, they're digital assets with unique identification codes. In 2025, however, you don't have to be too worried about NFT rug pulls, unless you're floating in some pretty niche spaces, with market penetration forecasted at a whopping — and stable — 0.15%.

That said, an NFT rug pull works just a little differently from a crypto rug pull: NFT developers promote a project — often under false pretenses — until they attract a whole bunch of investors' assets selling it. Whether a newly developed NFT or an existing one, the developers will make misleading claims about its value or potential, with the goal of knowingly selling low-value or valueless tokens at an inflated price.

Another, less common, NFT rug pull occurs when bad actors knowingly sell a token that has already been minted — meaning its ownership has already been established — to unsuspecting buyers.

Because crypto rug pulls rely on investors to raise assets — and because they're most effective when they gain investors' ill-begotten trust — it's common for these scams to involve a public figure. That's also why so many rug pulls have escaped the crypto community and made mainstream headlines. Well, that and the monumental losses some have imparted onto their victims.

Hawk Coin

Alright, let's get this one out of the way. We know no one wants to hear the words “Hawk” or “Tuah” ever again, but what is perhaps the most well-known example of a crypto rug pull also happens to be one of the most perfectly succinct, textbook examples of the grift.

In 2024, break “Hawk Tuah” memester Haliey Welch leveraged her sudden viral popularity to launch a meme coin called “Hawk.” She promo'd it all the way to a $490 million market cap before the token lost 95% of its value in a matter of hours. Welch then, of course, went totally incognito.

Squid Token

Similarly, in 2021, unknown South Korean devs launched Squid token, unofficially themed around the Netflix hit, “Squid Game.” When the price per token hit $2,861, the team's site magically disappeared, and the team couldn't be reached.

Thodex

Also in 2021, Thodex's founder, Faruk Özer, took a total of $2.6 billion worth of investment funds from 400,000 users before fleeing to Albania, claiming that the money was lost in a cyberattack.

EthereumMax

On the note of more celebrity-driven rug pulls, Kim Kardashian hyped EthereumMax to her 220 million-plus Instagram followers, alongside the likes of other celebs like Floyd Mayweather. She straight-up posted that EthereumMax's team burned 40 trillion tokens to inflate its value as a way of “giving back to the community.”

The token's value tanked 97% over six months, and Kim only suffered a measly (to her) SEC fine of $1.26 million for failing to label her post as an ad.

{Note: This article is not intended as investment advice, but rather to help you identify potential scams.}

Entering a (relatively) young investing space that's known for a lack of regulation and governing bodies — while a core part of crypto's decentralized appeal — inherently comes with a touch of risk. But as is virtually always the case, risk can be minimized with a healthy dose of know-how. Whether you're thinking of investing for the first time or you've already been around the block(chain) a few times, keep these tips in mind:

If you're uncertain about a token in any way, shape, or form, avoid investing at all — or, at the very least, start with a small amount of crypto before diving in head-on to minimize potential losses. And we probably don't need to tell you this, but if you take one thing away from the crypto rug pulls of the past, let it be this: Don't get pulled in by the paid promises of influencers or celebs promoting a token. Someone best known for making crude jokes on the internet probably isn't your best financial consultant.

You can also use people search tools to find publicly available information about crypto developers, promoters, or influencers. It's one way to add an extra layer of due diligence.

European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said Thursday the central bank has completed its technical and preparatory work on the digital euro and that it is now up to political institutions to act. The project, which aims to create a public digital means of payment, is under review by the European Council and the European Parliament.

Her remarks came during the ECB's final press conference of the year, where policymakers left the eurozone's key interest rates unchanged. Lagarde reaffirmed the ECB's commitment to a meeting-by-meeting approach to rate decisions, saying they will be based on “incoming economic and financial data,” the inflation outlook, and how effectively policy is working.

“We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path,” Lagarde said, adding that inflation remains on track to return to the ECB's 2% target by 2028. Revised projections show headline inflation averaging 2.1% in 2025 and dipping below target in 2026 and 2027 before rebounding to 2.0% in 2028.

While monetary policy holds steady, Lagarde pointed to the digital euro as a strategic priority for Europe's financial future.

“Our ambition is to make sure that in the digital age there is a currency that is the anchor of stability for the financial system,” she said. The ECB also called on E.U. institutions to move quickly to adopt the digital euro regulation.

ECB board member Piero Cipollone has also said a digital euro could ensure continuity of payments during cyberattacks or power outages that disrupt traditional banking infrastructure.

The digital euro is expected to launch in the second half of 2026, aligning with the timeline of other euro-backed stablecoin initiatives regulated under Europe's Markets in Crypto-Assets, or MiCA, regulation.

By Karen Brettell

Dec 17 (Reuters) – The recent crypto market bust has left some investors more cautious, after hitting some of the hottest and most-hyped corners of the industry the hardest. It may also provide a boon to emerging strategies that seek to more actively manage risks.

The universe of crypto investment alternatives has expanded dramatically in just a few years and now includes direct cryptocurrency purchases, spot ETFs, derivatives like put and call ‍options and futures, shares in mining and treasury companies, crypto exchanges and infrastructure providers.

But that is also bringing different investment results, with leverage, high valuations and funding concerns among the factors that have hurt various corners of the crypto markets.

“Investment vehicles for bitcoin have exploded across both retail and institutional markets, fundamentally expanding access,” said John D'Agostino, head of strategy at Coinbase Institutional. However, “the nuances matter in terms of how people want to express leverage and to what degree they want to hedge their exposure.”

BUYING TOO HIGH

Bitcoin tumbled as much as 36% from a record $126,223 on October 6, and remains around 30% below its high. Bitcoin treasury companies, led by Strategy Inc, have suffered even more.

These companies hold a significant portion of their corporate assets in cryptocurrencies ‌as a treasury reserve and often raise capital through stock or debt to acquire more digital assets.

For years, their share ‌prices traded at a premium to the value of the bitcoin they owned and many investors assumed that premium would keep growing forever.

But when bitcoin's price fell, those premiums collapsed. Strategy's stock has dropped 54% from bitcoin's October peak and is down 63% from its mid-July level. Japan's Metaplanet and a long list of smaller imitators were hit just as hard.

It became “a localized bubble,” said Lyn Alden, founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy. “Investors are now a lot more cautious of overpaying for those.”

MINING COMPANIES UNDERGO PIVOT PAINS

Mining companies like ​IREN, CleanSpark, Riot, and MARA Holdings, which have been investor favorites, have also faced setbacks. These firms, which secured cheap electricity under long-term contracts, are now pivoting to AI data centers for tech giants.

“Those stocks have been the best performers of the year because they combine two powerful themes: digital assets via their bitcoin exposure and ‍AI,” said Matthew Sigel, portfolio manager of VanEck Onchain Economy ETF, which invests in the crypto ​ecosystem.

But many saw weakness on concerns about some of these companies' profitability as they carry heavy debt and constantly need fresh cash ​to pay for the switch.

“The macro environment turned a little bit and those companies got punished,” Sigel said.

ENERGY KEY TO GROWTH

Over the next few years, crypto and AI investments ‍are expected to be increasingly intertwined, with crypto infrastructure seen as crucial for addressing power needs.

Morgan Stanley estimates U.S. data centers are facing a power shortfall of 47 gigawatts through 2028, but notes that converting crypto miners could alleviate a significant portion, potentially 10-15 GW or more.

“If you want to get a company with exposure to crypto, but also with exposure to an important growth story for the next five or ten years with the development of AI data centers, you've got to look at a lot of these miners,” said Brian Dobson, managing director of disruptive technology equity research at Clear Street.

THE NEXT WAVE

For some companies, a solution to poor ‍performance rests with offering actively managed and/or hedged strategies that can outperform during drawdowns.

Sigel's VanEck Onchain Economy ETF has seen a 32% return since the fund launched in May this year by deliberately underweighting over-leveraged names, he said. “Our conviction is that active management is the way to go in this space because it's still an immature asset ‍class.”

Activist investor Eric Jackson's EMJ Crypto Technologies (EMJX) has developed the ‍first actively hedged digital-asset treasury holding bitcoin, ethereum and selective alts, which also generates yield by selling options instead of ​repeatedly issuing equity or debt.

The company is now live, after SRx Health Solutions announced on Tuesday that it will purchase ​EMJX, with the ⁠combined company to be headed by Jackson. The ticker will switch to EMJX from SRXH after closing, which is ‌expected in the first quarter of 2026.

Through all the noise, bitcoin itself has strengthened its position as the clear leader among currencies, bolstered by strong institutional backing.

Harvard University's endowment now holds BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust as its largest publicly disclosed stock position. Sovereign wealth funds in Luxembourg, Abu Dhabi and the Czech Republic are building stakes.

It is also a favorite currency among crypto miners.

As more investment choices appear, Coinbase's D'Agostino argues that the overall market is starting to look like traditional commodities or stocks with regulated exchanges, safe custody options, and precise tools to bet on price direction, volatility, or steady income.

“If you're comfortable owning commodities, real estate, art, or gold, but crypto still scares you — you're simply misinformed.”

To the dismay of the bulls, crypto markets continued with their whipsawing action again on Thursday, with large early gains being more than reversed over a very short time frame.

Happening over a period of a couple of hours as opposed to yesterday's couple of minutes, the size of today's reversal was nearly as large, with leading crypto bitcoin BTC$86,817.46 slumping from a session high of $89,300 to as low as $85,500. At press time BTC was changing hands at $86,000, lower by 0.8% over the past 24 hours. The Nasdaq was off session highs of about 2%, but still sharply ahead with a 1.7% advance.

The early gains came alongside a much-cooler than forecast November U.S. Consumer Price Index report, with headline inflation tumbling all the way to 2.7% from 3% previously. That data had some quickly penciling in another Federal Reserve rate cut in January, which — all things being equal — would tend to be good for risk assets, including crypto.

Skeptics, however, quickly dove into the outlier inflation numbers. ""Major issue was zeroing out rent/owner's equivalent rent (OER) in October,"" wrote well-followed economist Omair Sharif. Unless the BLS adjusts, he continued, it will artificially lower year-over-year CPI prints until April

""This is totally inexcusable,"" wrote the WSJ's Nick Timiraos. ""The BLS just assumed rent/OER were zero for October ... There is just no world in which this was a good idea.""

At the moment, markets appear to be agreeing with the skeptics, with odds of a January rate cut not having budged from their previous slim 24% chance.

Traders in the crypto options market appear to be adjusting their expectations, with bitcoin and ether ETH$2,837.03 showing diverging sentiment, according to data from Wintermute. Bitcoin options activity points to a range-bound outlook as traders continue to sell downside protection below $85,000 and cap upside exposure above $100,000. 

This is ""pointing to confidence in support holding and limited expectations for a sustained breakout in the near term,"" the market maker's OTC trading desk wrote in a note.

Ether options, by contrast, show less conviction and more hedging behavior. Support appears to be forming around the $2,700 to $2,800 range, but upside calls above $3,100 are being sold aggressively, suggesting traders are seeking protection over upside.

Shares are ahead 9.5% early Thursday to $0.40.

Per the NAKA dashboard, the company has 5,398 bitcoin on its balance sheet. At bitcoin's current price of $88,000 those bitcoin are worth about $1 billion, or far north of NAKA's enterprise value of roughly $400 million. 

Share buybacks would thus apparently be highly accretive, even as they call into question the company business plan of swapping investor dollars for bitcoin.

The kicker? It's actually saving us.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Forget the Kármán line—there's a human-made space barrier to wonder about, first observed by NASA in 2017. The mysterious zone of anthropogenic space weather is caused by specific kinds of radio waves that we've been blasting into the atmosphere for decades, but experts say the expanding band actually helps protect humankind from dangerous space radiation. 

ScienceAlert reports that NASA first observed this belt in 2012. The agency sends probes to explore different parts of our solar system, including the Van Allen Belts: a huge, torus-shaped area of radiation that surrounds Earth. The donut shape follows the equator, leaving the North and South Poles free. 

The Van Allen Belts are related to and affected by the magnetosphere induced by the nonstop bombardment of the sun's radiation. They affect benign-seeming magnetic effects like the Northern Lights, as well as more destructive ones like magnetic storms. 

People planning spaceflight through areas affected by the Van Allen Belts, for example, must develop radiation shielding to protect crew as well as equipment—and most spacecraft launch from as near to the equator as possible, right in the Van Allen zone. 

So, what's our new protective barrier? The same probes that launched in 2012 to help us understand the Belts better in the first place detected this phenomenon, and in 2017, the probes gave us the first evidence of the radio-wave barrier emanating from Earth. ScienceAlert explains:

Why is this? Well, the very low frequency (VLF) waves are exactly right to cancel out and repel the radiative advances of the Van Allen Belts as a matter of total coincidence. In fact, NASA initially considered this a true coincidence, saying that a radio wave area happened to match exactly with the edge of the Van Allen Belts. But in 2017, the agency published findings revealing that one has caused the other after all.

Typically, services like the military have dibs on very low frequencies. These were the first frequencies to be discovered and used for broadcasting, but successive discoveries pushed private and recreational users further up the spectrum. At the very lowest point is the simplest broadcast, things like Morse code, where only binary values need to be received. After that, VLF used by military equipment, for example, occupies a chunk of wavelengths.

From there, AM is still pretty low, and FM is farther up. Some “regular” bandwidths of civilian-type radio are off limits because they're used for more traditional radio communications by people like pilots and ship captains for different purposes. Any physical communication like this must be negotiated—remember the government has objected to some 5G ideas because of the conflict with GPS satellite signals.

Isn't it interesting that VLF blankets the Earth without interfering with literally any other radio signal, for example, or the many other kinds of waves that flow around us all the time, but makes it into space far enough to push away harmful radiation? 

This means that, for example, space programs could develop VLF technology to punch holes for spacecraft to travel through. As always, truth is stranger than fiction.

What will we find inside these chambers?

Storage rooms aren't always the most enthralling places to discover or investigate. But when those storage rooms are 4,400 years old and were previously a complete mystery, things get a little more interesting. 

Plus, any chance to uncover ancient royal burial objects is an exciting one. 

Researchers surveying the Pyramid of Sahura—a 4,400-year-old Egyptian ruin built as the first burial site for a king at Abusir—discovered multiple storage rooms, the existence of which was previously entirely unknown. 

Conservation and restoration work has been ongoing at the 155-foot-tall site since 2019, but a research team only recently discovered the original dimensions of the pyramid and realized the initial floor plan of the antechamber had deteriorated over time. When this structural decline occurred, old walls gave way to new retaining walls, changing some of the interior makeup. While researchers working in the pyramid in 1836 had believed that passages found full of “debris and rubbish” could have led to storage rooms, others later disagreed, and the passageways weren't fully explored. 

But that has all changed. An Egyptian-German team discovered both the passages—proving the 1836 discovery correct—and eight storerooms in the ancient pyramid.

“Although the northern and southern parts of these magazines, especially the ceiling and the original floor, are badly damaged, remnants of the original walls and parts of the floor can still be seen,” the team wrote in a news release from the University of Würzburg.

To get a full view of the chambers, the team employed 3D laser scanning with a portable LiDAR scanner. This provided detailed surveys of the inside of the pyramid. “This advanced technology enabled comprehensive mapping of both the extensive external areas and the narrow corridors and chambers inside,” the team wrote. “The frequent scans provide real-time updates of progress and create a permanent record of exploration efforts.” 

Sahura sits amongst the Abusir complex, a popular burial site near the Nile River for pharaohs of the Fifth Dynasty of ancient Egypt. While not as illustrious as other ancient pyramid complexes, the necropolis contains 13 key structures.  

Finding and mapping the unknown storerooms is just one step in the process for exploring Sahura. Next comes the actual restoration of the chambers, a process which the team says they expect to “revolutionize the view of historical development of pyramid structures and challenge existing paradigms in the field.” 

Lofty goals for a suite of storage areas.

Pathology and the Foundations of Cancer Diagnosis

For decades, pathology has been essential to how doctors diagnose and treat cancer. A pathologist studies an extremely thin slice of human tissue under a microscope, searching for visual signs that reveal whether cancer is present and, if so, what type and stage it has reached.

To a trained specialist, examining a pink, swirling tissue sample dotted with purple cells is like grading a test without a name on it -- the slide contains vital information about the disease, but it offers no clues about who the patient is.

When AI Sees More Than Expected

That assumption does not fully apply to artificial intelligence systems now entering pathology labs. A new study led by researchers at Harvard Medical School shows that pathology AI models can infer demographic details directly from tissue slides. This unexpected ability can introduce bias into cancer diagnosis across different patient groups.

After evaluating several widely used AI models designed to identify cancer, the researchers found that these systems did not perform equally for all patients. Diagnostic accuracy varied based on patients' self-reported race, gender, and age. The team also uncovered several reasons why these disparities occur.

To address the issue, the researchers developed a framework called FAIR-Path, which significantly reduced bias in the tested models.

""Reading demographics from a pathology slide is thought of as a 'mission impossible' for a human pathologist, so the bias in pathology AI was a surprise to us,"" said senior author Kun-Hsing Yu, associate professor of biomedical informatics in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS and HMS assistant professor of pathology at Brigham and Women's Hospital.

Yu emphasized that recognizing and correcting bias in medical AI is critical, since it can directly influence diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. The success of FAIR-Path suggests that improving fairness in cancer pathology AI, and possibly other medical AI tools, may not require major changes to existing systems.

The work, which was supported in part by federal funding, is described Dec. 16 in Cell Reports Medicine.

Putting Cancer AI to the Test

Yu and his colleagues examined bias in four commonly used pathology AI models currently being developed for cancer diagnosis. These deep-learning systems were trained on large collections of labeled pathology slides, allowing them to learn biological patterns and apply that knowledge to new samples.

The team evaluated the models using a large, multi-institutional dataset that included pathology slides from 20 different types of cancer.

Across all four models, performance gaps consistently emerged. The AI systems were less accurate for certain demographic groups defined by race, gender, and age. For example, the models struggled to distinguish lung cancer subtypes in African American patients and in male patients. They also showed reduced accuracy when classifying breast cancer subtypes in younger patients. In addition, the models had difficulty detecting breast, renal, thyroid, and stomach cancers in some demographic groups. Overall, these disparities appeared in roughly 29 percent of the diagnostic tasks analyzed.

According to Yu, these errors arise because the AI systems extract demographic information from the tissue images -- and then rely on patterns linked to those demographics when making diagnostic decisions.

The findings were unexpected. ""Because we would expect pathology evaluation to be objective,"" Yu said. ""When evaluating images, we don't necessarily need to know a patient's demographics to make a diagnosis.""

This led the researchers to ask a key question: Why was pathology AI failing to meet the same standard of objectivity?

Why Bias Appears in Pathology AI

The team identified three main contributors to the bias.

First, training data are often uneven. Tissue samples are easier to obtain from some demographic groups than others, resulting in imbalanced datasets. This makes it harder for AI models to accurately diagnose cancers in groups that are underrepresented, including some populations defined by race, age, or gender.

However, Yu noted that ""the problem turned out to be much deeper than that."" In several cases, the models performed worse for certain demographic groups even when sample sizes were similar.

Further analysis pointed to differences in disease incidence. Some cancers occur more frequently in specific populations, allowing AI models to become especially accurate for those groups. As a result, the same models may struggle to diagnose cancers in populations where those diseases are less common.

The researchers also found that AI models can detect subtle molecular differences across demographic groups. For example, the systems may identify mutations in cancer driver genes and use them as shortcuts to classify cancer type -- which can reduce accuracy in populations where those mutations are less prevalent.

""We found that because AI is so powerful, it can differentiate many obscure biological signals that cannot be detected by standard human evaluation,"" Yu said.

Over time, this can cause AI models to focus on signals tied more closely to demographics than to the disease itself, weakening diagnostic performance across diverse patient groups.

Taken together, Yu said, these findings show that bias in pathology AI is influenced not only by the quality and balance of training data, but also by the way the models are trained to interpret what they see.

A New Approach to Reducing Bias

After identifying the sources of bias, the researchers set out to correct them.

They developed FAIR-Path, a framework based on an existing machine-learning method known as contrastive learning. This approach modifies AI training so that models focus more strongly on critical distinctions, such as differences between cancer types, while reducing attention to less relevant differences, including demographic characteristics.

When FAIR-Path was applied to the tested models, diagnostic disparities dropped by about 88 percent.

""We show that by making this small adjustment, the models can learn robust features that make them more generalizable and fairer across different populations,"" Yu said.

The result is encouraging, he added, because it suggests that meaningful reductions in bias are possible even without perfectly balanced or fully representative training datasets.

Looking ahead, Yu and his team are working with institutions worldwide to study pathology AI bias in regions with different demographics, clinical practices, and laboratory settings. They are also exploring how FAIR-Path could be adapted for situations with limited data. Another area of interest is understanding how AI-driven bias contributes to broader disparities in health care and patient outcomes.

Ultimately, Yu said, the goal is to develop pathology AI systems that support human experts by delivering fast, accurate, and fair diagnoses for all patients.

""I think there's hope that if we are more aware of and careful about how we design AI systems, we can build models that perform well in every population,"" he said.

Wearable human–machine interfaces could provide immersive, multisensory interactions, turning everyday items into smart haptic devices for virtual and augmented reality. However, the development of tactile wearables with kinaesthetic feedback remains limited by the size and weight of the devices, which restricts portability and comfort. Here we report a haptic ring that weighs 18 g and offers three-degrees-of-freedom force sensing and feedback. The system has an origami-inspired structural base that provides efficient and compact force transmission, and a soft force-sensing skin capable of simultaneously detecting shear and normal forces. The force-sensing skin is made by combining a topology-optimized, laser-patterned layer that has pyramid microstructures with a layer with four resistive pixels, an approach that ensures linear sensitivity and a rapid response time. The ring, which is powered by soft pneumatic actuators and integrated with inkjet-printed bending sensors, can provide kinaesthetic force feedback of up to 6.5 N.

R/R0 is the change in relative resistance as a function of applied force. Resistance was recorded under time-interval controlled loading; overlapping force points from repeated measurements (n=5) showed a negligible standard deviation (10−4, 0.00017 − 0.00098), so error bars are not shown.

The sensor is fabricated by printing nanoparticle ink onto a PET layer, which is then embedded within rigid tiles. When the layer folds, the resistance of the conductive ink path changes, allowing it to function as both a sensor and a folding hinge. To mitigate drift and nonlinearity, two sensors are used in a tension-compression pair configuration, embedded in opposite base hinges of the prismatic joint. One side of each sensor is anchored, while the other side slides freely within the origami structure. This design accommodates a larger bending radius, minimizing tension-side cracks and enhancing sensor durability.

Thanks to the compression-tension pair compensation approach, the resulting combined signal preserved a full-scale sensitivity and nonlinearity throughout the cyclic test despite the degradation at the individual compression and tension sensors.

The Chinese-language artificial intelligence app Haotian is so effective that it's made millions of dollars selling its face-swapping technology on Telegram. The service integrates easily with messaging platforms like WhatsApp and WeChat and claims that users can tweak up to 50 settings—including the ability to adjust things like cheekbone size and eye position—to help mimic the face they are impersonating. But while Haotian is a robust and versatile platform, researchers and WIRED's own analysis have found that the service has been marketing to so-called “pig butchering” scammers and those running online fraud operations in Southeast Asia.

Scammers have used Haotian and other deepfake tools to more easily substantiate their deceptions by allowing victims to “videochat” with the character they believe they have been talking to as part of an investment opportunity, friendship, or even romantic relationship. Analysis by the cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic of four cryptocurrency wallets linked to Haotian shows the company has received at least $3.9 million in payments in recent years, including money from cryptocurrency wallets linked to alleged criminal activity, including fraud. Additionally, almost half of its payments had ties to a scam marketplace sanctioned by the US government, Elliptic says.

Hieu Minh Ngo, a reformed criminal hacker turned cybercrime investigator at the Vietnamese scam-fighting nonprofit ChongLuaDao, says that Haotian, which emerged around 2021, was “one of the first of its kind and very popular.” Ngo has conducted extensive research into Haotian and its operations. “Its results are nearly perfect,” he says. “And they are getting better and better every day. If you check in the crypto wallet, you will see the money coming in every single day.”

Haotian is just one part of the wider tech ecosystem that has emerged around Southeast Asia's booming cybercrime industry and forced labor scam compounds. And as face swapping and other video deepfake tools have become more widely available, they have increasingly been incorporated into scamming and other types of cybercrime around the world. In the last two years, officials working for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime have identified more than 10 face-swapping tools potentially being used by cybercriminals in Southeast Asia, including for cryptocurrency scams and police officer impersonation.

Haotian has a website for its face-swapping tool, but it primarily promotes its desktop app via a public Telegram channel, which launched in October 2023 according to Ngo's research. Through this channel, which now has more than 20,000 subscribers, the company markets new versions of the app, gives development updates, and offers technical support. While marketing software through Telegram isn't inherently nefarious, researchers say that Haotian's customer base has increasingly skewed toward scammers who already seek out information about an array of gray market services on the messaging app.

Telegram declined to comment. However, after WIRED got in touch with the company, the main public Haotian Telegram channel and some associated accounts became inaccessible or appeared to have been deleted. Telegram did not return a request for comment on whether the company took these accounts down.

Haotian is a Cambodia-based company that says it is headquartered in Phnom Penh and advertises on-site installation services and support in the region. UN researchers highlighted this “same-day on-site installation” service with a screenshot in their 2024 report that shows Haotian's logo on a phone screen at a possible scam site.

The company's marketing materials on both its website and Telegram frequently reference the tool's utility for what could be potentially shady activity. One post on Telegram says the technology can help to create an “elite, authentic persona” that the “client completely believes.” (Scammers often refer to people that are being scammed as customers or clients). Another message highlighted by researchers said: “The chat lacks authenticity? No Trust? Use Haotian AI face-changing software to make a video call to solve all your troubles. After all, how could such a beautiful girl lie?”

Research published in March by the security firm Tehtris tracked various domain names that appear to have been linked to Haotian in recent years, including the current site “haotian.ai,” and past addresses “haotianai.com” and “haotianai.us.” Meanwhile, Ngo's research found that Haotian's website has openly referred to social engineering techniques. On both Telegram and its own website, Haotian's discussion of social engineering frequently uses the phrase “精聊” or “jingliao” that literally means “deep chat” or “spiritual chat.” In practice, though, the phrase refers to social engineering and particularly connotes “pig butchering” scams.

When WIRED reached out to a Haotian Telegram account in English with questions about the service, it responded in Chinese saying it could not communicate in English and that it does not “accept” interviews. “Our target customers are entertainment streamers or live salers,” the Haotian account said in Chinese. “We only provide face-swapping software for live streaming and do not allow our products to be used for illegal activities.” In some of its materials, the company notes, according to translations by WIRED, that it places limitations on creating deepfake pornography.

Haotian told WIRED that it would terminate accounts if it found they were being used for fraud and said it is “not true” that it advertises to scam centers. The account speculated that if such marketing exists, it is “most likely” from accounts impersonating Haotian. When asked about language on haotian.ai that appears to market to scammers, the Haotian Telegram account said that the company does not have a website. After WIRED sent the account a screenshot of the current Haotian website and a link to an archived version, the Haotian Telegram account deleted the entire conversation.

There are a few ways to use Haotian's desktop software. Gary Warner, director of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm DarkTower, says that the most seamless face swaps come from using the company's pre-programmed faces or inputting a number of photos of a person so the company can build a face model of them. Examples in promotional videos include Elon Musk and Leonardo DiCaprio, but users could also provide materials so the system can generate their own face or someone else's. The less source material Haotian has to work with, the less compelling the results will be. Regardless, users can tweak their face-swapped appearance using granular tools to hone various facial attributes. The video output, according to researchers and the company's promotional videos, can be streamed to video calls on WhatsApp, Line, Telegram, Facebook, Viber, Zoom, WeChat, and other platforms.

Additionally, Haotian advertises voice impersonation features and an AI support chatbot in an associated Telegram channel. Posts in the company's Telegram channel say its technology supports “cloning anyone's voice for real-time calls or voice messages” and changing a voice from sounding male to sounding female or the reverse.

Security advocates and authorities around the world have increasingly warned about the threat of cybercriminals using face-swapping tools as part of scams. One concrete measure people can take to help detect potential fraud is to require that the person they are video chatting with waves their hands in front of their face to check for glitches or distortions that could indicate a deepfake. Haotian claims in posts, though, that it has added improvements so the system will work seamlessly if someone touches their face with their hands or waves their hands in front of their face while on video. Posts on Telegram also claim that the service supports blowing kisses, blinking, licking lips, or the subject turning or shaking their head.

While a version of its software can be downloaded from the Haotian website, the firm has primarily sold its software using subscriptions. A previous version of Haotian's website said a “fully functional” version of its software could cost $4,980 per year, while cheaper packages were also available.

Days after Haotian launched its Telegram channel in October 2023, Ngo's research says, the company also set up a Telegram account linked to Huione Guarantee, which is sometimes known as Haowang Guarantee. The online marketplace, linked to the Cambodian company Huione Group, provided a deposit and escrow service over Telegram, facilitating the sale of many of the tools needed for scamming, including the sale of victim data, deepfake services, electrified GPS-tracking shackles used in human trafficking, and more. In January, before Huione Guarantee was shut down and then sanctioned by the US government for helping facilitate scams, researchers estimated that the platform had facilitated more than $24 billion in gray market transactions.

Huione Guarantee was Haotian's payment processor and escrow service as well. Evidence of the relationship has been visible for years in Telegram channels related to both companies where customers are completing payments. Chat logs reviewed by WIRED as well as findings from multiple researchers reinforce this link.

Tom Robinson, cofounder and chief scientist at the cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic, says cryptocurrency wallets used by Haotian have received 3,558 payments totalling $3.9 million in recent years. $1.2 million of that was between Haotian and Huione entities, with transactions between them ending on November 7. The service uses the stablecoin Tether, also known as USDT. There have been more than 3,007 payments in excess of $100, Robinson says, and the biggest incoming transaction to Haotian has been for $14,890, he says, with a “large number” of transactions around $500.

Some cryptocurrency wallets paying Haotian have been linked to potential criminal activity, according to Robinson's research. “Proceeds of at least 52 known fraud instances had ended up at these wallets,” he says, adding that accounts linked to the fraud incidents were flagged by Elliptic's partners. “That's exactly what you'd expect if this is a platform that's used by fraudsters—that they'd be paying for it from the proceeds of fraud that they've committed.”

While Haotian regularly releases new features and improves the quality of its deepfakes, it is, of course, only one of many possible tools that scammers could use as part of their operations. The broader scam economy also relies on the trade of stolen data, fake social media accounts, and websites used to scam people, in addition to the vast array of digital tools that make up the fraud tech stack.

Andrew Fierman, the head of national security intelligence at cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis, says that Haotian's operations broadly seem similar to those of other companies that operated on the sanctioned Huione Guarantee platform—tech entities that often processed a few hundred thousand dollars or a few million. The amounts are small compared with the scale of the Southeast Asian scam economy overall, but Fierman says that these incremental transactions to tech sellers help prop up the illicit ecosystem overall.

“A few thousand dollars goes a long way,” he says. “We're not talking about technology that's costing a hundred thousand dollars to get a pig butchering scam up and running. A buyer is likely not only buying AI voice and facial recognition software, they're looking to get data and to build websites and do the other aspects of the scam tech ecosystem.”

In a remarkable pivot, Athira Pharma is shifting its primary focus from Alzheimer's to oncology following a multi-year period marked by clinical failures and leadership turnover. 

The Bothell, Wash.-based company announced today that it has licensed a Phase 3 breast cancer drug from Sermonix Pharmaceuticals, supported by $90 million in funding from a group of healthcare investment firms. It could land an additional $146 million if the research yields promising results. 

Athira will simultaneously continue researching ATH-1105, its own drug candidate for treating ALS.

Athira President and CEO Mark Litton called the development “exciting and transformative news.”

“By securing rights to this late-stage program — while also advancing pATH-1105 for ALS — we are building a pipeline that we believe has the potential to change lives and create enduring value,” Litton said on LinkedIn. “We are honored to have the backing of some of the most respected biotechnology funds in the industry.”

Following the deal announcement, the company's stock rose 70% to $7 per share.

Athira has been through a tumultuous few years:

Under today's deal, Athira secures an exclusive license to develop and commercialize the breast cancer therapy for nations outside of Asia and select Middle Eastern countries. The drug, called lasofoxifene, is currently in a clinical trial that has enrolled over half of its target patient population, with initial results expected in mid-2027.

The agreement provides Sermonix with 5.5 million shares of Athira's stock. The Seattle company has also committed to paying Sermonix up to $100 million plus limited royalties if certain commercial targets are reached.

Three lead investors are backing the research: New York's Commodore Capital, biotech hedge fund Perceptive Advisors, and California-based TCGX. Additional participants are ADAR1, Blackstone Multi-Asset Investing, Kalehua Capital, Ligand Pharmaceuticals, New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Spruce Street Capital and 9vc.

Athira raised $90 million by selling stock and warrants to investors, extending its cash runway into 2028. If investors choose to exercise those warrants in the future, the company could receive up to an additional $146 million to fund its clinical programs.

“We're proud to support this evolution and excited by the opportunity to deliver meaningful impact for patients and shareholders alike,” said Joseph Edelman, founder and CEO of Perceptive Advisors, in a statement.

Regarding its own ALS drug candidate, Athira this year successfully completed Phase 1 safety trials, and plans to start Phase 2 trials early next year.

Amazon is adding a new feature to Alexa+ that adds a conversational AI to Ring doorbells, letting users manage deliveries, turn down sales folks, and let family or friends leave a message when they are not around.

Called Greetings, the feature helps Ring determine who is visiting your house based on their apparel, actions, and what they are holding, and responds accordingly. For example, if the system sees a person in a delivery uniform dropping off a package, it will respond based on your instructions. 

The feature adds settings that let you specify where delivery people can leave packages, and direct them toward water or snacks you might have kept out. If a delivery person needs a signature, Alexa can also ask them when they might return, and pass that message to the user.

It can also handle sales reps or service vendors. You can set an instruction such as “If someone comes to the door trying to sell something, politely let them know we're not interested.” 

And if you're busy or not home, Alexa can greet friends or family when they visit, and ask them to leave a message for you.

It goes without saying that the tech presents the risk of misidentifying people and responding inappropriately — if, for example, a friend works in logistics and comes to see you after work in their delivery uniform, Ring may, via Alexa, ask them to leave a package somewhere instead of letting them leave a message.

The new feature follows a controversial facial recognition feature for Ring called “Familiar Faces” that lets you create a catalog of the faces of up to 50 people who visit you regularly. Once labeled, these people will be named in the Ring app's timeline and notifications when they visit. 

Amazon says Greetings uses Ring's video descriptions to determine who the main subject in front of the camera is for generating responses, and it doesn't identify who the person is.

The feature is compatible with Ring Wired Doorbell Pro (3rd Gen) and Ring Wired Doorbell Plus (2nd Gen) and is available to users on the Ring Premium Plan who have enabled video descriptions. It is rolling out to Alexa+ Early access customers in the U.S. and Canada.

Though, to be play devil's advocate for a second, it does seem that diabetes is typically where the symptoms start, and we do understand that diabetes is fundamentally metabolic and/or functional dysfunction in 1 or more of 7-ish different areas.I think it's the level of perspective zoom + timing we take that makes the article's assertion either useful or not.If we zoom out, while catching disease early on, and we address the metabolic conditions via lifestyle and/or certain drugs like GLP1, then we prevent the need to intervene on the kidney and cardiac front.But if we zoom in to a specific issue, after disease has progressed a profound amount, a GLP1 intervention may be too little, too late.Hopefully though, this may help the messaging to folks that if they are contending with metabolic disease that presents as diabetes, introducing lifestyle and pharma interventions early may be helpful on the larger epidemiological front.

This logic error is easy to make, and the headlines all too often imply it, but it isn't always true (sometimes it is).

reply

When an article starts like this, I instantly close it and wait for proper sources. Anyway, the phrase ""metabolic syndrome"" has been gaining currency for the last few years. For those who don't want to read journal papers and meta-analyses, there are plenty of doctors and fitness coaches (on YouTube) who have made videos on how to get metabolic syndrome under control or even reverse it. And many of the doctors do a good job of filtering and summarizing the research.

This seems needlessly cynical. Someone can have multiple objectives in writing, to tell you facts and also to capture your attention or to convey an emotion and motivate you to action. Very little writing is done with a single purpose in mind. We don't expect academics drafting research papers to eschew concerns about the impact the writing will have on their career for example.Starting a story with an anecdote that humanizes the information is simply acknowledging the reality that people want more than just facts. If the latter was all they wanted, most of us would only read encyclopedias and textbooks.

Right now models have roughly all of the written knowledge available to mankind, minus some obscure held out private archives and so on. They have excellent skills and general abilities to construct plausible sequences of actions to accomplish work, but we need to hold their hands to really get decent performance across a wide range of activities. Skills and agent frameworks and MCP carve out different domains of that problem, with successful solutions providing training data for future models that might be able to be either generalized, or they'll be able to create a vast mountain of synthetic data following successful patterns, and make the next generation of models incredibly useful for a huge number of tasks, by default.It might also be possible that by studying the problem, identifying where mode collapses and issues with training prevent the right sort of generalization, they might tweak the architecture and be able to solve the deficiency through normal training runs, and thereby discard the need for all the bespoke artisanal agent specifications.

You can have the most capable human available to you, a supreme executive assistant. You still have to convey your intent and needs to them, your preferences, etc, with as high a degree of specificity as necessary.And you need to provide them with access and mechanisms to do things on your behalf.Agentic definitions are the former, and they will evolve and grow. I like the metaphor of deal terms in financial contracts- benchmarkers document billions of these now. The ""deal terms"" governing the work any given entity does for you will be rich and bespoke and specific, like any valuable relationship. Even if the agent is learning about you, your governance is still needed.MCP is the latter. It is a protocol. It will get extensions. Skill-like directives and instructions will get delivered over it.Skills themselves are near term scaffold that will soon disappear.

However the ""waiting out"" strategy needs a timeout. It might happen that agentic crutches around LLMs will bear fruit much sooner than high-quality LLMs arrive. If you don't have a timeout or a decent exit criteria you may end up waiting indefinitely, or at least until reality of things becomes too painful to ignore.The ""ski rental problem"" comes to mind here, but maybe there is another ""wait it out"" exit strategy?

The reason I ask is that the pace of new things arriving is overwhelming, hence I was tempted to just ignore it. Not because things had signs of transience, but because I was drowning and didn't know where to start. That is not the same thing as actually observing signs of things being too foamy.

BUT what makes them powerful is that you can include code with the skill package.Like I have a skill that uses a Go program to traverse the AST of a Go project to find different issues in it.You COULD just prompt it but then the LLM would have to dig around using find and grep. Now it runs a single executable which outputs an LLM optimised clump of text for processing.

Inversely, you can persist/summarize a larger bit of context into a skill, so a new agent session can easily pull it in.So yes, it's just turtles, sorry, prompts all the way down.

You need a practical and efficient way to give the llm your context. Just like every organization has its own standards, best practices, architectures that should be documented, as new developers do not know this upfront, LLMs also need your context.An llm is not an all knowing brain, but it's a plan-do-check-act text processing machine.

There's no real benefit to the MCP protocol over a regular API with a published ""client"" a local LLM can invoke. The only downside is you'd have to pull this client prior.I am using local ""skill"" as reference to an executable function, not specifically Claude Skills.If the LLM/Agent executes tools via code in a sandbox (which is what things are moving towards), all LLM tools can be simply defined as regular functions that have the flexibility to do anything.I seriously doubt MCP will exist in any form a few years from now

I've found that a quality process that starts with ""you need to comprehensively understand what you're engineering"" is almost universally a non-starter for anyone not already using these things. Putting together an exhaustive list of all the ways code interacts with the outside world is hard. If a few engineers actually manage it, they're rarely empowered to make meaningful decisions on whether the consequences of failures are acceptable or fix things if they're not.

Much better to do as you say and think about the software and its role in the system. There are more and less formal ways to do this, but it's definitely better than taking a component view.

“The reason is that, in other fields [than software], people have to deal with the perversity of matter. [When] you are designing circuits or cars or chemicals, you have to face the fact that these physical substances will do what they do, not what they are supposed to do. We in software don't have that problem, and that makes it tremendously easier. We are designing a collection of idealized mathematical parts which have definitions. They do exactly what they are defined to do.And so there are many problems we [programmers] don't have. For instance, if we put an ‘if' statement inside of a ‘while' statement, we don't have to worry about whether the ‘if' statement can get enough power to run at the speed it's going to run. We don't have to worry about whether it will run at a speed that generates radio frequency interference and induces wrong values in some other parts of the data. We don't have to worry about whether it will loop at a speed that causes a resonance and eventually the ‘if' statement will vibrate against the ‘while' statement and one of them will crack. We don't have to worry that chemicals in the environment will get into the boundary between the if statement and the while statement and corrode them, and cause a bad connection. We don't have to worry that other chemicals will get on them and cause a short-circuit. We don't have to worry about whether the heat can be dissipated from this ‘if' statement through the surrounding ‘while' statement. We don't have to worry about whether the ‘while' statement would cause so much voltage drop that the ‘if' statement won't function correctly. When you look at the value of a variable you don't have to worry about whether you've referenced that variable so many times that you exceed the fan-out limit. You don't have to worry about how much capacitance there is in a certain variable and how much time it will take to store the value in it.All these things are defined a way, the system is defined to function in a certain way, and it always does. The physical computer might malfunction, but that's not the program's fault. So, because of all these problems we don't have to deal with, our field is tremendously easier.”— Richard Stallman, 2001: <https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/stallman-mec-india.html#conf9>

Has some fun anecdotes in it. My favorite being the nuclear certified supersonic aircraft having a latent defect discovered during integration of a new subsystem. Turns out all of the onboard flight computers crashed at the transition from sub to supersonic, thankfully the aircraft had enough inertia to ""ride through"" all of their flight computers simultaneously crashing during the transonic boundary.Moral of that story is your software people need to have the vocabulary to understand the physical properties of the system they're working on.

The parent company of Truth Social is merging with a private nuclear fusion company in an effort to help “America win the A.I. revolution.” There's just one problem: Nuclear fusion still has many technical and economic hurdles to clear before it's ready for commercial use.

Trump Media and Technology Group and TAE Technologies announced Thursday that they've agreed to a merger valued at roughly $6 billion. Once the deal closes, it could create one of the world's first publicly traded nuclear fusion companies.

The merger isn't expected to close until mid-2026, but the companies are already touting ambitious plans. According to a press release, the combined company expects to break ground on what it calls the world's first utility-scale fusion power plant in 2026. That plant is expected to produce 50 megawatts of energy, enough to power roughly 15,000 homes. The companies also said they are planning to work on larger future plants that can generate between 350 and 500 megawatts.

“We're excited to identify our first site and begin deploying this revolutionary technology that we expect to fundamentally transform America's energy supply,” said TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer in the release.

Under the terms of the deal, Binderbauer would serve as co-CEO of the merged company alongside Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes.

Trump Media launched shortly after President Donald Trump's first term in office. Initially rumored to become a television network, the company instead debuted the social media platform Truth Social, which has struggled to gain traction with both users and advertisers. Since then, Trump Media has branched out into other ventures, including cryptocurrency.

Shares of Trump Media are down roughly 70% so far this year, though they jumped more than 20% in premarket trading following the merger announcement.

For its part, TAE Technologies was founded in 1998 and has raised over $1 billion from major backers including Google, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Goldman Sachs.

Unlike nuclear fission, the technology used in today's nuclear power plants and produces long-term radioactive waste, fusion mimics the process that powers the sun. It works by combining atoms to release massive amounts of energy. In theory, fusion can use hydrogen as fuel, produce no greenhouse gas emissions, and carry no risk of a meltdown. A single kilogram of fusion fuel can release as much energy as roughly 13,000 tons of coal, according to the University of Pennsylvania.

The catch is that no one has yet built a fusion reactor or plant that reliably generates electricity on a commercial scale.

Among fusion's biggest challenges is cost. Today, fusion remains significantly more expensive than alternatives like fossil fuels or renewable sources, such as solar energy. Nuclear fusion reactors also require advanced and costly materials that can withstand the extreme temperatures and radiation produced during the fusion process. And while fusion relies on hydrogen isotopes for fuel, one of those isotopes is extremely rare in nature and expensive to produce.

Still, Binderbauer told investors on a call Thursday that the company plans to achieve “first power” by 2031.

TAE isn't alone in pitching an aggressive timeline. Helion Energy, a fusion startup backed by Sam Altman, began construction this year on a fusion power plant it says will supply electricity to Microsoft data centers by 2028.

For the past five months, astronomers around the world have meticulously tracked a strange visitor from another solar system as it zips through our own. Now, it's about to make its closest approach to Earth.

Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will fly by our planet at a safe distance of 1.8 astronomical units (roughly 167 million miles or 270 million kilometers) at 1 a.m. ET on Friday, December 19, according to calculations by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. That's about twice the average difference between Earth and the Sun.

You won't be able to see 3I/ATLAS with the naked eye, but you could catch a fuzzy, faint glimpse of it in the predawn sky through a powerful pair of binoculars or a backyard telescope.

If you want a clearer view, the Virtual Telescope Project 2.0 will host a livestream of the flyby starting at 11 p.m. ET on Thursday, December 18, and you can watch it below. This astronomical program, overseen by the Bellatrix Astronomical Observatory in Italy, uses remotely controlled telescopes to provide real-time observations of space.

This comet is considered “interstellar” because it hails from another star system. 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object astronomers have ever discovered, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Spotting one offers a rare opportunity for researchers to study a literal sample from a far-off corner of the galaxy that current spacecraft can't reach.

3I/ATLAS's Friday fly-by will be especially valuable for science. This will be astronomers' best opportunity to observe the comet and gather data before it leaves our solar system for good. In the months since the NASA-funded ATLAS observatory discovered 3I/ATLAS on July 1, researchers have been working tirelessly to study its chemistry and composition.

Their findings have led to multiple hypotheses about 3I/ATLAS's origin. One early study suggested it came from an ancient star system in a region of the Milky Way called the thick disk. This region surrounds the thin disk (where our solar system lies) and contains older stars. A later study contradicted this idea, pointing to the thin disk instead.

Even if astronomers can't narrow down 3I/ATLAS's origin any further, studying its characteristics can tell us more about what its home system is like. For example, researchers have found that the comet is chock-full of carbon dioxide, suggesting it formed in an environment with higher levels of radiation than our solar system.

3I/ATLAS is zooming through space incredibly fast—it reached its maximum speed of 153,000 miles per hour (246,000 kilometers per hour) when it made its closest approach to the Sun in late October. After Friday, it will slowly fade into the distance as it travels deeper into the outer solar system, so you won't want to miss this opportunity to see it up close—relatively speaking.

If you want to observe 3I/ATLAS with your own telescope or binoculars, here's everything you need to know.

Your best chance of spotting the comet will be during the pre-dawn hours, about 90 minutes before sunrise. According to BBC Sky at Night Magazine, you can locate it in the morning sky by finding the constellation Leo, then looking toward the lower left of its brightest star, Regulus, and the Sickle asterism.

More specifically, you'll need to star-hop with your telescope from Regulus to the magnitude 3.8 star Rho Leonis, then look half that distance in the same direction until you see a small, misty smudge. With binoculars, it will appear even fainter.

There are plenty of astronomy apps available to help you locate the comet, such as Stellarium or SkyView. But if you want to save yourself the trouble, you can see 3I/ATLAS in more detail via the Virtual Telescope Project's livestream. No matter how you choose to watch, witnessing such a rare and scientifically spectacular event will be well worth it.

The average Ryzen 7 5800X3D is being sold for more money than a new Ryzen 7 9800X3D


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The DDR5 memory pricing crisis has sent the whole PC market into utter chaos, including pricing on AMD's flagship AM4 gaming chip. eBay prices for the Ryzen 7 5800X3D have skyrocketed to the point where these chips are being sold regularly for more money than a brand-new Ryzen 7 9800X3D.

Second-hand prices for the 5800X3D average around $500-$600 on eBay. Some of the highest-selling units sold at nearly $800, showing how desperate some buyers are to buy AMD's best gaming chip that still uses DDR4 memory. Average pricing for the Ryzen 7 5800X3D is around $500 right now, which is more money than AMD's latest Ryzen 7 9800X3D. Even AMD's slightly lower-end Ryzen 7 5700X3D is going for $300-$450 on eBay.

For reference, these prices represent almost double what the Ryzen 7 5800X3D used to go for brand new. The chip initially launched at $450 MSRP, but eventually trickled down into the $320 range months later. The absolute lowest price we saw the chip at (brand new) was $269 in August 2023.

Secondhand prices for the 5800X3D have been at or around MSRP for a while, due to the fact that AMD stopped production of the 5800X3D a while ago. However, its most recent price hikes of $500 upwards are new, likely due to the new DRAM pricing crisis forcing buyers back to AM4. AM4 is the only platform that supports DDR4. AMD opted to discontinue DDR4 support completely when creating AM5. Intel is also in a similar boat, having locked itself to DDR5 support exclusively for its latest Core Ultra 200S series chips.

The Ryzen 7 5800X3D took the PC gaming world by storm when it launched in 2022, being the first CPU to take advantage of AMD's 3D-VCache technology. Performance was a generation ahead of other Zen 3 parts, enabling it to outperform Intel's $700+ Core i9-12900KS flagship at the time in gaming performance. Once Zen 4 arrived, the 5800X3D continued to provide value, proving to be an excellent mid-range alternative and outperforming some of AMD's lower-end Ryzen 7000 parts in gaming performance while running on the cheaper AM4 platform with cheaper DDR4 memory.

Buying a 5800X3D for $500 may seem ludicrous, but the aforementioned AM4 support is why the chip is being purchased at these elevated prices. AM4 is still thriving, with plenty of AM4 motherboards still being sold at major retailers for well below $150. Where AM4 is excelling right now is in motherboard and memory combos; at Newegg, you can still find AM4 motherboard + DDR4 memory combos for $150 or less. However, even DDR4 RAM hasn't been immune to price hikes, meaning you still need to shop around for a bargain, unless you already own some, of course.

If you are looking to buy used Ryzen 7 X3D models right now, it's worth checking out the 5700X3D, which is selling at significantly lower prices overall compared to the 5800X3D on eBay. On the flip side, if you own a 5800X3D or 5700X3D, now is the best time to sell it.

Gestational diabetes can cause a multitude of complications in the offspring, but to date, the reasons are incompletely understood. A new study, exploring a foundational step in the process of building proteins from genetic material, called splicing, reveals that this process is affected, altering how the placenta reads and processes genetic instructions. Researchers found that in pregnancies affected by gestational diabetes , hundreds of genetic messages are assembled incorrectly, potentially disrupting how the placenta functions. They identified a key protein, SRSF10, that appears to contribute to the disrupted process. . When this protein was blocked in lab cells, the same errors seen in gestational diabetes appeared, suggesting that targeting SRSF10 could one day help mitigate the deleterious effects of gestational diabetes on the offspring.

New study uncovers an unknown mechanism linking gestational diabetes to pregnancy complications. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a form of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, has an increasing prevalence worldwide. GDM causes a disrupted metabolic environment for the fetus, including elevated blood glucose levels from the mother. This may result in immediate complications for the newborns, such as being born too large or too small for gestational age, more caesarean deliveries, pre-term deliveries, and more. . It also has long-lasting effects on the offspring, with higher risks for obesity and diabetes later in life.

A new study led by Prof. Maayan Salton from the Faculty of Medicine at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Dr. Tal Schiller from the Faculty of Medicine at Hebrew University, Kaplan Medical Center, and Wolfson Medical Center at Tel Aviv University, reveals that gestational diabetes alters the placenta at the molecular level in ways never seen before.

Published in Diabetes, a leading journal in the field, the study found that GDM changes how the placenta processes its genetic messages. Using advanced RNA sequencing data from both European and Chinese pregnancy cohorts, the team discovered hundreds of alterations in how RNA molecules are ""spliced"", the step that determines which protein instructions are ultimately produced. These changes were strongly linked to genes involved in metabolism and diabetes-related pathways.

A key finding centered on SRSF10, a protein that helps control RNA splicing. When researchers reduced the activity of SRSF10 in placental cells, the same molecular disruptions seen in GDM appeared. This suggests that SRSF10 may be a master regulator of placental function, and potentially a new therapeutic target for preventing pregnancy complications.

""By understanding how gestational diabetes disrupts the placenta at the molecular level, we can begin to imagine new ways to protect the offspring"" said Prof. Salton. ""Our findings bring us a step closer to that goal,"" added Dr. Schiller. ""By pinpointing the specific molecular players involved, like the SRSF10 protein, we can start thinking about how to translate this knowledge into real-world strategies to improve pregnancy outcomes.""

Gestational diabetes is typically managed through diet, exercise, and insulin, but its underlying biology has remained poorly understood. This research sheds light on how the metabolic changes observed in GDM can alter how genes are processed, opening new avenues for intervention.

We have information on how you can join US Soccer's coveted ticket lottery.

The most coveted ticket lottery will take place next month: the US Soccer ticket draw for World Cup tickets. We learn about how the process will go on Episode 167.

The US Soccer Insiders Ticket Draw will commence in January, and we have the information on how it will work. We go through how the lottery application will go and some frequently asked questions, some of which may not have clear answers. We also go through the difference between the US Soccer draw and the FIFA lottery which is currently in an application window. There will be two separate draws: the Standard Insider draw for free Insiders members. 10% of the US Soccer allocation will be earmarked for that draw. The Premium-Keeper Insider Draw will see 90% of tickets earmarked for paid members, outside of Coaches Circle members who are guaranteed World Cup ticket access. Members can also get additional lottery entries based on longevity of membership.

We detail all the process and discuss the questions in a way that hopefully provides some clarity.

After the break, we have been working on new merch and finally we have it!

We have information on how you can join US Soccer's coveted ticket lottery.

The most coveted ticket lottery will take place next month: the US Soccer ticket draw for World Cup tickets. We learn about how the process will go on Episode 167.

The US Soccer Insiders Ticket Draw will commence in January, and we have the information on how it will work. We go through how the lottery application will go and some frequently asked questions, some of which may not have clear answers. We also go through the difference between the US Soccer draw and the FIFA lottery which is currently in an application window. There will be two separate draws: the Standard Insider draw for free Insiders members. 10% of the US Soccer allocation will be earmarked for that draw. The Premium-Keeper Insider Draw will see 90% of tickets earmarked for paid members, outside of Coaches Circle members who are guaranteed World Cup ticket access. Members can also get additional lottery entries based on longevity of membership.

We detail all the process and discuss the questions in a way that hopefully provides some clarity.

After the break, we have been working on new merch and finally we have it! We recently announced the 2026 USA Soccercast line of jerseys, lightweight hoodies, and other team gear through our friends at Stimulus Athletic!

MANCHESTER, England (AP):

The winners of the 2026 World Cup will receive a record jackpot of US$50 million, FIFA said yesterday.

That figure is up from US$42 million in 2022 and US$38 million in 2018. But it is still less than half of what was on offer at the much less-hyped Club World Cup earlier this year.

World football's governing body said the total prize fund for the World Cup, staged in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, was US$655 million – a 50 per cent increase on the previous edition in Qatar.

By comparison, the Club World Cup, which was controversially expanded from seven teams to 32 and shoehorned into the football calendar, had a total prize fund of US$1 billion. The top prize for the winning team was worth up to US$125 million for a tournament that faced fierce resistance from players and leagues and drew sparse crowds for some matches.

The Club World Cup, also staged in the United States, was won by Chelsea.

FIFA has a different distribution model for the two tournaments, with the disparity in prize money reflecting factors such as clubs overseeing much higher costs through wages than national teams.

Beyond prize money, further funds are put toward development of football globally.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino said the World Cup would be “groundbreaking in terms of its financial contribution to the global football community.”

World football's governing body approved the prize money for every stage of the World Cup at a meeting of its council in Doha.

The runners-up will receive US$33 million, with US$29 million, and US$27 million going to the third and fourth-place teams respectively.

The lowest prize money will be US$9 million and all 48 participating nations will get US$1.5 million to cover what FIFA describes as “preparation costs.”

FIFA said, in all, US$727 million would be distributed to the football federations participating.

It is not known how each nation will distribute the money, but at the last World Cup, French sports daily L'Equipe reported France players were in line for a bonus of US$586,000 by their federation if they won the trophy. France was ultimately beaten by Argentina in the final.

The MBTA has released early transportation guidance for visitors ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, as officials prepare for an estimated 450,000 fans traveling to the Boston area next summer. The Boston Consulting Group projects the tournament could generate an estimated $500 million in net economic impact for the region. 

The MBTA has spent the past year coordinating with the Healey-Driscoll Administration, local municipalities, and Gillette Stadium/The Kraft Group in the last year to prepare for the international event.

“The MBTA fully understands the critical role it will play in moving soccer fans next year, and we expect to transport up to 20,000 riders in and out of each match,” MBTA representative Lisa Battiston wrote in an e-mail to Boston.com. 

It will release service schedules, ticket information, and more in the coming months on MBTA.com/WorldCup.

Gillette Stadium will be renamed “Boston Stadium,” FIFA's designation of the stadium located in Foxborough.

Boston Stadium will host seven games this summer from June 13 to July 9, which includes five group stage games, a Round of 32 matchup, and a quarterfinal. Ticket prices range from $180 to $1,270 for the events in Boston. \

There will be a Boston Stadium Express train from the Boston area to Foxborough during this period. Tickets to Boston Stadium will go on sale Spring 2026 on the MBTA's mTicket app. The guide also states: “You must have a ticket to a World Cup match to buy Boston Stadium Train tickets.”

“None of us want transportation to be the story when the World Cup is here,” MBTA General Manager Phillip Eng told Boston25 News. “We need to make sure we protect the level of service for commuters while moving fans.”

The transit agency included guides on airport transportation and how to use the T, including ferry, bus, commuter rail, and subway service.

Work at Foxboro Station has been underway since August and is expected to conclude by June 2026. The $35 million renovation aims to expand capacity and improve accessibility ahead of World Cup influx.

A generational showdown is officially on the calendar as Spain and Argentina prepare to contest the Finalissima in Qatar, setting up a first-ever senior meeting between Lamine Yamal and Lionel Messi. With the European and South American champions colliding at Lusail Stadium, the one-off clash promises symbolism, history and World Cup-level intensity just months before the 2026 tournament.

Spain and Argentina have confirmed plans to face each other in the Finalissima, with the intercontinental clash scheduled for March 27 at Lusail Stadium in Qatar. The fixture brings together the reigning European champions and the holders of the Copa America in a showcase match that has quickly become one of the most prestigious events on the international calendar outside the World Cup.

The match will mark the fourth edition of the Finalissima overall, though it is only the second time this century that the trophy has been contested. Argentina are the current holders, having defeated Italy 3-0 at Wembley in 2022, while earlier incarnations of the competition saw France beat Uruguay in 1985 and Argentina overcome Denmark on penalties in 1993.

Beyond the silverware, the confirmed meeting has captured global attention due to the individual narratives involved. The game will see Barcelona prodigy Yamal face Messi for the first time at senior international level, with the teenager likely to line up for Spain against the Argentine captain in a symbolic clash of football's present and future.

The Finalissima represents more than just a one-off trophy, acting as a flagship event in the ongoing partnership between UEFA and CONMEBOL. By pitting the champions of Europe against the champions of South America, the fixture is designed to celebrate continental excellence while offering fans a rare competitive crossover between the two dominant regions of the international game.

For Argentina, the setting adds a layer of emotional significance as Lusail Stadium is where Messi lifted the World Cup in 2022, ending a 36-year wait for La Albiceleste for football's most coveted prize. Spain, meanwhile, arrive as European champions and one of the favourites for the 2026 World Cup.

The spotlight will inevitably fall on the meeting between Yamal and Messi, a pairing that feels almost poetic given their shared connection to Barcelona. Both are left-footed right-wingers, both have worn the iconic No.10 shirt, and both emerged from La Masia as generational talents, albeit at very different stages of their careers.

At just 18, Yamal has already become a central figure for both club and country, playing a key role in Spain's European Championship success and regularly drawing comparisons to Messi. The teenager has repeatedly attempted to temper those narratives, insisting he wants to follow his own path rather than be framed as a successor to the Argentine legend.

Their relationship, however, stretches back far further than this confirmed meeting. Images of Messi posing with a baby Yamal during a charity calendar shoot in 2007 resurfaced during Euro 2024, while additional photos show the pair together at Barcelona's training ground when Yamal was still an academy player, and Messi was at the peak of his world-beating powers.

Attention will now turn to March 27, when Spain and Argentina meet in Qatar for a match that carries both sporting and symbolic weight. The Finalissima will be decided over 90 minutes, with penalties used if the score remains level, ensuring a definitive winner on the night at Lusail Stadium.

For both teams, the fixture also forms part of their broader preparation for the 2026 World Cup. Spain and Argentina are among the favourites for the expanded tournament, and the Finalissima offers a rare chance to test themselves against elite opposition outside their respective confederations.","{'href': 'https://www.foxsports.com', 'title': 'FOX Sports'}","soccer"

DR Congo's hopes of qualifying for a maiden World Cup appear to be in jeopardy after the Nigeria Football Federation confirmed it had submitted a petition to FIFA over alleged 'fraudulent' practices by the Central Africans.

The Leopards earned their place in the March intercontinental play-offs after edging Nigeria 4-3 on penalties in last month's CAF Playoffs final staged in Morocco.

Sebastien Desabre's men are now set to face the winner of the New Caledonia vs. Jamaica tie, with the victor advancing to Group K alongside Portugal, Uzbekistan, and Colombia.

However, the NFF claimed they formally lodged a complaint with the football ruling body, challenging the eligibility of several DR Congo players who reportedly changed nationalities without proper clearance. 

""There are players that got theirs (passport) in just two or three months. So, that is to us what we consider as a breach of that regulation and that was why we submitted that (petition), "" NFF General Secretary Sanusi Mohammed told the media.

""The Congolese law says you cannot have dual nationality. Wan-Bissaka has a European passport and there were so many of them that have European passports.

""Some of them French passports, some of them Dutch passports. So, the rules are very clear. We cannot say anything now, but we have submitted our (petition).

""FIFA regulation states once you have a passport of your country, you are eligible but our contention is FIFA was deceived into clearing them.

""On the basis of what was presented to FIFA, it was on that basis that FIFA cleared them but we are saying it was fraudulent. That is all.""

Per Flashscore.com findings, at least nine players were flagged as ineligible, including Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Axel Tuanzebe, and Arthur Masuaku.

Cameroon had earlier raised similar concerns about European-born players representing DR Congo, but the Congolese dismissed the allegations as unfounded. 

Now, Nigeria's petition could trigger a review that might have major consequences for the Leopards' World Cup aspirations.

Meanwhile, the Congolese Football Federation (FECOFA) has dismissed the NFF's protest, describing it as an attempt to succeed through the ‘back door' and tagging Nigeria a bad loser.

Under DR Congo law, dual citizenship is generally not recognised, meaning players who hold or recently held foreign passports may technically be ineligible to represent the country. ","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","soccer"

Defending champions Arsenal will face London rivals Chelsea in the Women's Champions League quarter-finals, if they can defeat OH Leuven in the knockout play-offs. The Gunners beat the Belgian minnows 3-0 in the last round of the league phase and will be heavily favoured to do so again, making an all-English quarter-final incredibly likely.

Arsenal finished fifth in the UWCL league phase, missing out on an automatic berth through to the quarter-finals by just one point, meaning they are one of eight teams that must navigate the play-off round in February. Manchester United also finished just a point off the top four, in sixth, and have a rematch from the league phase on their agenda as well, after drawing an Atletico Madrid side they beat 1-0 back in October, despite being down to 10 for more than half of the game. Win that two-legged tie, to be played in February, and German giants Bayern Munich will be waiting for the Red Devils in the next round.

Here is the draw in full:

Atletico Madrid vs Man Utd

Paris FC vs Real Madrid

OH Leuven vs Arsenal

Wolfsburg vs Juventus

Not only did this draw decided the play-off ties, it also designated each team to either the silver or blue path, thus making clear their paths through the quarter-finals and semi-finals, through to the final, with there to be no more draws this season as a result. It means that each of the four teams that sealed an automatic berth through to the last eight - Barcelona, Lyon, Chelsea and Bayern Munich - know which matches to watch in February to keep an eye on their next opponents in the Champions League.

Chelsea have been assigned to the blue path, to face Arsenal or Leuven in the last eight, with eight-time UWCL winners Lyon allocated to the same side. The French giants will face either Wolfsburg or Juventus in their quarter-final, with the winners of that tie and the Chelsea one to meet in the semi-finals.

On the silver path, Barcelona, winners of three of the last five editions of this competition but defeated in the final last season by Arsenal, will await the winners of a clash between Paris FC and, most notably, Real Madrid, with Bayern Munich then to face Man Utd or Atletico. The winners of those two quarter-finals will then face off in the last four.

Having reached six of the last seven UWCL finals, Barca are one of the favourites to triumph again this season, but they do face some challenges. The squad is much smaller this season and injuries have already started to make that hit even harder, with three-time Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati to potentially miss the rest of the season after suffering a leg break. Lyon, then, have been the pick of many to win this year's trophy. OL were outstanding in the league phase, finishing level on points with Barca but coming second due to goal difference, and have one of the most in-form players in Europe on their side, in Melchie Dumornay.

There are plenty of others who will fancy their chances, though, not least a Chelsea side that has come so close over the years but often had their European dream ended by a rampant Barca. To hold the Catalans to a draw in the league phase was encouraging in that sense and that the Blues would not meet them until the final feels significant. However, they may have to defeat an incredible Lyon team in order to get to that stage.

The knockout play-offs will be played in February, with the first legs to take place on February 11 and 12 and the second legs to follow on February 18 and 19. The winners of those ties will then join Barcelona, Lyon, Chelsea and Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals, which will take place across March 24 and 25 and April 1 and 2. The semi-finals will follow a month later before the final is played at the Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo, Norway, on May 23.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Nicolai Budkov Kjaer moved to the brink of the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF semi-finals on Thursday in Jeddah, where he overcame Spaniard Rafael Jodar 4-1, 4-2, 1-4, 4-2.

The Norwegian produced an impressive display to defeat Martin Landaluce in four sets in his Blue Group opener and is now 2-0 this week after resisting a mid-match fightback from Jodar in the King Abdullah Sports City.

“I'm just trying to focus on winning the matches, but to be qualified [would be] cool, so I hope it happens,” said Budkov Kjaer. “I started off great… Every shot I played went in, and Rafa was probably a bit nervous, which is probably normal. It's tough to play a match after a big win. I'm very happy with the win of course.”

In front of a lively crowd, Budkov Kjaer fired two aces and an unreturned first serve in his final service game to wrap up victory in 79 minutes. With his win, he earned a dose of Jodar revenge, having lost to the Spaniard in the 2024 US Open boys' singles final.

The 19-year-old Budkov Kjaer will qualify for the semi-finals later on Thursday if Martin Landaluce defeats Learner Tien. However, even if top seed Tien wins later on Day 2, Budkov Kjaer is still very well placed to reach the last four at the 20-and-under event.

In a standout season, the Norwegian has won four ATP Challenger Tour titles and climbed from outside the Top 500 in the PIF ATP Rankings to No. 138.

Jodar, a three-time Challenger Tour champion this year, upset World No. 28 Tien in his Jeddah opener to record his first Top 100 win. The 19-year-old Spaniard is 1-1 this week and will meet Landaluce in his final round-robin match, still very much in contention for a semi-final berth.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Landaluce & Jodar: From Madrid mates to Jeddah contenders","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/landaluce-jodar-next-gen-atp-finals-2025-feature","Thu, 18 Dec 2025 09:58:53 GMT","

The buzz around the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF couldn't feel further removed from the red clay courts tucked away in Madrid, but for Martin Landaluce and Rafael Jodar, the connection is unmistakable.

Both Spaniards were born in 2006, both grew up at the club in the Spanish capital — Chanmartin Tennis Club — and both have been orbiting each other since they were nine years old. Their journeys haven't always been run side by side, but fittingly, they've crossed again on one of the biggest stages of their young careers: grouped together at the 20-and-under showpiece in Jeddah.

“It's fun because we've known each other since we were nine years old, and he's been a good friend of mine,” Landaluce told ATPTour.com, reflecting on his relationship with Jodar. “We played many, many times and we were in many tournaments together.

“There was a time I distanced a bit more to play in better tournaments, but now we are back together here in Jeddah, and it's nice to have him here.”

Their story is one of shared beginnings but rather separate detours. Landaluce committed early to the professional path, leaving Madrid at 14 to train at the Rafa Nadal Academy. The exposure paid off quickly and at 16, he won the 2022 US Open boys' singles title, a result that put him firmly on the radar.

Meanwhile, Jodar — who stands one inch shorter than Landaluce at 6'3“ — took a more measured route. Yet two years later, he carved his name onto the same US Open trophy as Landaluce with his 2024 triumph, adding another shared chapter to their story.

“When I won the 2022 US Open, I think he [Jodar] thought, ‘If he does it, why am I not able to do it?',” Landaluce said. “Then he won it last year, and it's so good to have this. I think we both are pushing each other, and it's nice to have a Spaniard here, who is also from Madrid and he's also from my club.”

After triumphing at Flushing Meadows, Jodar headed straight into college tennis at the University of Virginia, where he is now a sophomore. In 2025, the 19-year-old blended the structure of the NCAA with a late-season surge on the ATP Challenger Tour, where he won three titles and catapulted over 700 spots in the PIF ATP Rankings to World No. 168.

“It feels very good to be back here as a player,” said Jodar, who served as a hitting partner in Jeddah last year. “When I was here hitting with these players last year, I was thinking to myself that maybe one day I was going to make it, and fortunately, things were very good this year. At the end of the season, I had very good results and that gave me the opportunity to play here in Jeddah.”

Last year's 20-and-under event already felt like a preview of what was to come. Landaluce missed the cut by a single spot and attended as an alternate, while Jodar was present as a hitting partner, soaking it all in and getting a close-up look at the level required.

Twelve months on and the roles have changed considerably: Landaluce returns not on standby, but as the fourth seed, and Jodar is no longer confined to the practice courts, but in the field as one of the fastest-rising players of 2025.

While their paths have differed, their inspirations are very much shared. Nadal remains the benchmark and meeting the 22-time major champion in Jeddah last year was a childhood moment realised. And, like so many young Spaniards, both have drawn motivation from Carlos Alcaraz's ascent to World No. 1.

“We've had many good Spanish players,” Jodar said. “When Rafa Nadal was finishing his career, Alcaraz came to keep winning Grand Slams for Spain. It's a great feeling to see Spanish players winning major titles, and I'm super happy how things are going for Alcaraz, he's a great person.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Basavareddy discusses 'huge' Cervara partnership","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/basavareddy-cervara-feature-next-gen-atp-finals-2025","Thu, 18 Dec 2025 17:09:51 GMT","

Nishesh Basavareddy knows exactly what is at stake on Friday at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. After splitting his first two round-robin matches, the 20-year-old American heads into a must-win clash with Justin Engel, with a semi-final berth hanging in the balance.

Pressure moments are nothing new at this level, but this time Basavareddy faces them with a fresh, heavyweight presence courtside. Working alongside him for the first time at a tournament is Gilles Cervara, one of the most respected coaches on the ATP Tour.

Cervara guided Daniil Medvedev to the 2021 US Open and No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings in 2022. He joined forces with Basavareddy in December following his split with Medvedev in August. For Basavareddy, the move felt natural.

“My team reached out to his team after we heard about his split with Daniil,” Basavareddy told ATPTour.com in Jeddah. “We just thought it'd be a great fit with all his experience and his mindset. I'm really glad it worked out.”

The partnership represents a new challenge for both. For Cervara, it's a return to the developmental process with a rising talent. For Basavareddy, it's a chance to accelerate his growth with someone who has already mapped the road to the very top.

Early conversations between player and coach have focused on the foundations of game, body and long-term sustainability.

“The game is a huge, huge aspect,” Basavareddy said on what they have been working on in December. “Physically, that's also a big area I can continue to improve in. We're trying to build the right team around us to improve that side. I've also put a lot of work into my serve.”

Basavareddy reached the semi-finals at the ATP 250 in Auckland in January and then took a set off Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open. However, he was unable to find his best level for large parts of the season, with his other tour-level wins coming in Cincinnati, Los Cabos, Winston-Salem and Hangzhou.

Short-term priorities for the pair are now clear, with a focus on conditioning and preparation for the 2026 season. Beyond that, the vision widens.

“Initially it's to try to get healthy, try to get ready for the new season and then moving forward, just try to become the best player I can be and see how far, how far we can go up the rankings.”

The director says Damon's claim that he turned down 10 percent of 'Avatar' to play Jake Sully isn't exactly true: ""It wouldn't have happened. He doesn't have to beat himself up anymore."" 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


James Cameron says Matt Damon‘s viral claim of rejecting the lead role in Avatar — and losing out on a massive payday — isn't entirely accurate.


	The backstory: For the past two years, a video of Damon has made the rounds, explaining how The Martian star was offered the role of Jake Sully in the 2009 blockbuster in exchange for a whopping 10 percent of the film's gross (the role went to Sam Worthington).




	“Jim Cameron called me — he offered me 10 percent of Avatar,” Damon says in the clips (below). “You will never meet an actor who turned down more money than me … I was in the middle of shooting the Bourne movie and I would have to leave the movie kind of early and leave them in the lurch a little bit and I didn't want to do that … [Cameron] was really lovely, he said: ‘If you don't do this, this movie doesn't really need you. It doesn't need a movie star at all. The movie is the star, the idea is the star, and it's going to work. But if you do it, I'll give you 10 percent of the movie.'”

					James Cameron Is Ready to Move Beyond 'Avatar': ""I've Got Other Stories to Tell""		
			









	Given that Avatar grossed $2.9 billion, the claim suggests Damon lost potentially hundreds of millions by rejecting the film and, by extension, its two subsequent sequels.




			Popular on THR		







	But Cameron says — to quote Rose in Titanic — that the reality is “somewhat different.”


	“He was never offered the part,” Cameron tells The Hollywood Reporter. “I can't remember if I sent him the script or not. I don't think I did? Then we wound up on a call and he said, ‘I love to explore doing a movie with you. I have a lot of respect for you as a filmmaker. [Avatar] sounds intriguing. But I really have to do this Jason Bourne movie. I've agreed to it, it's a direct conflict, and so, regretfully, I have to turn it down.' But he was never offered. There was never a deal. We never talked about the character. We never got to that level. It was simply an availability issue.”

	











	Added Cameron: “Now what he's done is he's extrapolated ‘I get 10 percent of the gross on all my films.' And if, in his mind, that's what it would've taken for him to do Avatar, then it wouldn't have happened. Trust me on that.”


	“So he's off the hook and doesn't have to beat himself up anymore,” Cameron playfully adds. “Matt, it's okay, buddy! You didn't miss anything.”


	Cameron added that he respects Damon and thought it was classy of the actor to reach out and noted that turning down a movie due to a prior commitment is an “ethical” move. “He felt compelled to call me personally and tell me; he said he didn't want it to come from the agent — that's an honorable guy,” Cameron says. “So all respect to Matt. I'd love to work with him someday. But that never happened. It was a conflation of different things that were happening.”


	We've reached out to Damon's rep to see if the actor has a response. 


	Cameron famously had to fight to cast Worthington in the role. The Australian actor was little known at the time, and other actors in contention included Channing Tatum. Cameron was drawn to Worthington's raw intensity to play the tough space marine, and the actor's screen test with co-star Zoe Saldaña sealed the deal.


	In the latest film, Fire and Ash, Worthington arguably gives his best performance in the franchise yet.  “Sam's character is challenged in ways he hasn't been before, and I think Sam as an actor has grown,” Cameron says. “Not that he was ever not raw and real and authentic, but I think he's grown in the wisdom of his choices.”

	











	Cameron is on the cover of this week's issue of The Hollywood Reporter and sounds off on the future of Avatar, his secret Terminator project, the threat of AI and many more topics. Read the full story.

Kylie Kelce reflected on watching brother-in-law Travis Kelce's devastating Kansas City Chiefs game over the weekend — with her daughters and Taylor Swift by her side.

During Thursday's episode of her “Not Gonna Lie” podcast, Kylie explained that her and husband Jason Kelce's four daughters had not yet attended a game at Arrowhead Stadium until this past Sunday.

“This week I had some business being at Arrowhead Stadium to watch my brother-in-law's game with my family,” Kylie told listeners. “The girls had not yet seen Uncle Trav play in Arrowhead Stadium.”

The podcast host, 33, added that their kids — Wyatt, 6, Elliotte, 4, Bennett, 2, and 8-month-old Finnley — had seen Travis play in the Super Bowl, but not at his home stadium.

“We actually got to go and see him play at Arrowhead Stadium, which is his home stadium and has been for his entire NFL career, so that was a really cool moment,” she said. 

“It was also super exciting to get to see friends and family that were there because the girls were so excited to get to watch a game with all of them.”

The former athlete, who married the retired Philadelphia Eagles player in 2018, admitted that Finnley was able to nap throughout the game.

“Finnley slept through all the screaming and cheering,” Kylie said, noting that the infant is often able to snooze in their noisy household. 

As for the other girls, Kylie said that they are “not that interested” in football. 

“They actually yell at us any time we put football on the TV and only get on board after a little while of realizing that they can really yell,” she shared.

Kylie and her kids were spotted watching last Sunday's Chiefs vs. Los Angeles Chargers game from a VIP suite with Swift.

At one point, the pop star sweetly held one of Kylie's girls in her arms as they watched the game.

Swift, who had celebrated her 36th birthday the day before, was dressed in a chic Italian wool coat by Ulla Johnson. 

Unfortunately, the tight end's team suffered a devastating blow, losing to the Chargers, 16-13. The loss meant the Chiefs will not be in the playoffs — marking the first time since 2014 that the franchise is not in the running for the championship game.

While Travis won't be getting a shot at his fourth Super Bowl ring this season, Swift got a different ring of her own earlier this year.

The “New Heights” co-host, 36, proposed to Swift in August after two years of dating.

He got down on one knee in the backyard of his Leawood, Kan., estate and presented her with an old mine brilliant-cut diamond ring designed by jeweler, Kindred Lubeck of Artifex Fine. 

They are expected to tie the knot this summer in Rhode Island.

Gil Gerard, best known for starring in “Buck Rogers in the 25th Century,” has died at 82 after battling cancer. The actor is remembered for his legacy and candor. Gerard, the actor best known for bringing the wisecracking space hero to life on “Buck Rogers in the 25th Century,” has died. 

He was 82. Gerard died Tuesday in Georgia after battling “a rare and viciously aggressive form of cancer,” his wife, Janet, announced in a Facebook post. 

The Arkansas-born actor became a familiar face on television through sci-fi and drama, and in an unusually candid later chapter of his life.

Gerard rose to fame as Capt. William Anthony “Buck” Rogers, a NASA and U.S. Air Force pilot accidentally frozen in space and awakened centuries later, in NBC's “Buck Rogers in the 25th Century.” The lighthearted sci-fi series ran from 1979 to 1981 and was preceded by a feature-length television movie that became an unexpected hit.

The role nearly passed him by. Gerard later admitted he was hesitant to take it on.

“I saw what it did to Adam West's career with Batman, and this was another cartoon character. I didn't want to do this campy stuff,” he said in a 2018 interview.

Ultimately, he agreed to star in the project, and the “Buck Rogers” movie finished among the top 25 domestic box office releases of 1979. 

The film was later retooled into the show's two-hour pilot episode. The series ran for two seasons, producing 32 episodes, and ended in April 1981.

In later years, Gerard reflected on what made the character resonate with audiences.

“I thought the character had a sense of reality about him,” he said in 2017. “The sense of humor, I liked very much, and his humanity, I liked. I thought it was kind of cool. He wasn't a stiff kind of guy. He was a guy who could solve problems on his feet, and he wasn't a superhero.”

Born Gilbert Cyril Gerard on January 23, 1943, in Little Rock, Arkansas, he was the youngest of three boys. His father worked as a knife salesman, and his mother was a teacher.

After graduating from Little Rock Catholic High, Gerard studied at Arkansas State Teacher College before moving to New York in 1969. He trained at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy and supported himself by driving a cab.

One passenger helped him land an audition for “Love Story.” Though his scene was cut, Gerard worked on the film for weeks and soon found steady work in commercials, appearing in more than 400 ads by his own count, as confirmed by The Hollywood Reporter.

Gerard later spoke candidly about lifelong struggles with weight and health. He became the focus of the 2007 Discovery Health Channel documentary “Action Hero Makeover,” which followed his decision to undergo gastric bypass surgery after his weight reached 350 pounds.

In a 1990 interview with People, Gerard estimated that overeating had cost him nearly $1 million in lost work opportunities over the years.

Gerard was married four times, including a high-profile marriage to actress Connie Sellecca from 1979 to 1987. He is survived by Janet, his wife of 18 years, and his son, Gib.

In a final message shared on his Facebook account, Gerard reflected on his life with gratitude and perspective.

“My life has been an amazing journey. The opportunities I've had, the people I've met and the love I have given and received have made my 82 years on the planet deeply satisfying. … Don't waste your time on anything that doesn't thrill you or bring you love. See you out somewhere in the cosmos.”

For fans of classic television and science fiction, Gil Gerard leaves behind a legacy rooted in humor, honesty, and a hero who felt unmistakably human.

The end of the year means one thing for movie lovers: lists upon lists upon lists. In addition to lists of the best movies and shows of the year (and IndieWire has plenty of those for anyone interested!), there's The Black List, which collects the most acclaimed unproduced screenplays circulating through Hollywood. And now, the newly-launched IP List aims to serve a similar purpose for journalistic articles that are ripe for film adaptation. 

The list, which was compiled by the PopShift (a project of Pathos Labs) and supported by the Nielsen Foundation, consists of 25 longform articles, books, and podcast series published by journalists that seem ripe for film adaptation. Topics range from hard-hitting political journalism and true crime to sports fare and lighthearted human interest stories, providing potential topics for filmmakers of all stripes.

“Some of the most powerful film and television content is adapted from journalistic reporting. But these deals are mostly reserved for large legacy publications,” journalist and IP List founder Christine McLaren said in a statement. “This inequitable distribution of opportunities is not just failing journalism — it's failing the entertainment industry too. I am honored to launch The IP List 2025 as a first step toward changing that and showing just how much the journalism industry as a whole, in all its richness and diversity, has to offer Hollywood.”

Taylor Swift has announced the remaining episode release dates of her six-part documentary series The End of an Era. On Thursday morning, the superstar announced on Good Morning America that episodes 3 and 2 will hit on Disney+ on Friday, Dec. 19, while the last two episodes (5 and 6) will air on Dec. 23, rather than Dec. 26, as previously expected.


	“As an early gift to fans around the world, the final two episodes will premiere early on December 23 at 12am PT,” Disney+ announced on social media.


	The series, which chronicles Swift's record-breaking Eras Tour, premiered the first two episodes on Dec. 12, a day before the star's birthday. The film encapsulates the tour's phenomenon — counting down the final months before the last show and capturing all the backstage drama and fan community that rallied around it.


	The first two episodes showcased the band and dancers of the mythical tour, including musicians like bassist Amos Heller, who have been at Swift's side for years. In the first episode, Swift also discusses the thwarted terror plot that forced her to cancel three nights of the Eras Tour in Vienna, becoming emotional as she says her team “dodged a massacre.”

	The doc's first episodes also included heartfelt moments like a jam session with Ed Sheeran (who went on the road with Taylor on the Red tour and has since built his own massively successful career), Florence Welch prepping for a surprise performance of “Florida!!!,” and lead dancer Kameron Saunders opening up about facing discrimination as a black dancer with a larger body and what the historic tour means to him.

	











	“The directors [Don Argott and Sheena M. Joyce] expanded upon the stories of not just me, but everyone who was part of this,” Swift said at a screening earlier this month. “There was a lot of magic and mystery that happens when something goes as well as this (tour) did.”

President Donald Trump has been fully briefed on America's secret UFO programs and the existence of multiple alien races here on Earth. At least that is what UFO whistleblower David Grusch claimed in a recent interview.

David Grusch is a veteran of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). He also spent 14 years in the Air Force before working in intelligence. He has been very vocal, along with several other former United States government officials, about the existence of aliens.

In 2024, Grusch testified before the House Oversight Committee about the existence of secret black programs inside the United States government. These program, he claims, conducted unsanctioned technological research related to UFOs.

He has also claimed that he has knowledge of a spacecraft in the U.S. government's possession. Grusch says he shared this information with the FBI, CIA, Department of Homeland Security, tech entrepreneurs, and financial leaders during a secret meeting in New York City.

More recently, in an interview with Fox News, Grusch claims President Donald that Trump has received reports on crashed spacecraft and non-human remains. He also claims Trump received a briefing on the existence of numerous alien races. One of those alien races has supposedly been crossbreeding with humans to make an alien-human hybrid.

“Members of this current administration are very well aware of this reality. Certainly, the current president is very knowledgeable on this subject,” David Grusch said.

Missouri congressman Eric Burlison has backed many of David Grusch's claims about UFOs and aliens. The congressman explained in an interview earlier this year that “Nordic aliens are like a few hundred years more advanced than we are, but they're not super advanced.”","{'href': 'https://brobible.com', 'title': 'BroBible'}","other"

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday directing federal agencies to reclassify marijuana, loosening long-standing restrictions on the drug and marking the most consequential shift in U.S. cannabis policy in more than half a century.

The order, once finalized by the Drug Enforcement Administration, moves cannabis out of Schedule I classification — the most restrictive category under the Controlled Substances Act, alongside heroin and LSD — to a Schedule III classification, which encompasses substances with accepted medical use and a lower potential for abuse, such as ketamine and Tylenol with codeine.

""This action has been requested by American patients suffering from extreme pain, incurable diseases, aggressive cancers, seizure disorders, neurological problems and more, including numerous veterans with service related injuries, and older Americans who live with chronic medical problems that severely degrade their quality of life,"" Trump said from the Oval Office Thursday.  

Also on Thursday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, led by Dr. Mehmet Oz, is expected to launch a pilot program in April enabling certain Medicare-covered seniors to receive free, doctor-recommended CBD products, which must comply with all local and state laws on quality and safety, according to senior White House officials. The products must also come from a legally compliant source and undergo third-party testing for CBD levels and contaminants.

Shares of cannabis conglomerates were mixed following the announcement. Shares of Tilray Brands were up about 6% while shares of Trulieve sank roughly 15% and Green Thumb Industries fell around 5% in afternoon trading. The AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF, which tracks American operators, fell more than 10%.

The reclassification is viewed by many analysts as a financial lifeline for the cannabis industry. The move exempts companies from IRS Code Section 280E, allowing them to deduct standard expenses like rent and payroll for the first time. It also opens the door for banking access and institutional capital previously sidelined by compliance fears. 

But many on Wall Street also expect the changes and the Medicare pilot to draw major pharmaceutical players into the sector to chase federally insured revenue.

While CBD has surged in popularity in recent years, with infused consumer goods ranging from seltzers to skincare, the FDA has stopped short of granting the compound its full backing. 

Studies have found ""inconsistent benefits"" for targeted conditions, while FDA-funded research warns that prolonged CBD use can cause liver toxicity and interfere with other life-saving medications. 

Currently, the FDA has only approved one CBD-based, Epidiolex, for rare forms of epilepsy.

""I want to emphasize that the order ... doesn't legalize marijuana in any way, shape or form, and in no way sanctions its use as a recreational drug,"" Trump said. 

Experts and industry insiders told CNBC this week that a reclassification could pave the way for more research into the effects of CBD use.

President Donald Trump's social media company, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), said on Thursday that it's merging with TAE Technologies, a Southern California-based company that has been chasing the dream of fusion power for nearly 30 years.

The all-stock transaction, valued at more than $6 billion, would expand Trump Media's presence into the nascent fusion power space while data centers clamor for more electricity amid the ongoing AI boom. 

Fusion industry insiders expressed curiosity over the deal and voiced concerns about potential conflicts of interest with the U.S. Department of Energy. Last week, industry representatives met with Energy Department officials, urging them to help direct billions of dollars toward fusion projects, and earlier this year, the DOE announced a new roadmap to guide commercial efforts in the sector, though it didn't commit any new funds alongside the announcement.

TMTG is the parent company of Truth Social, the microblogging platform that the president spun up after he was banned from platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook in the wake of the January 6 attacks on the U.S. Capitol. At launch, the president called it “a rival to the liberal media consortium,” and said he wanted to “fight back against the Big Tech companies.”

TMTG went public last year via a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), a technique used to go public by private companies that want to raise money quickly but aren't yet mature enough to take the traditional IPO route. In the quarter ended September 30, 2025, TMTG reported that it recorded a loss of $54.8 million on revenue of $972,900.

Truth Social and the company's streaming platform have failed to generate much revenue, but TMTG has nevertheless managed to amass $3.1 billion in assets, largely through its cryptocurrency investments and partnerships.

TMTG CEO Devin Nunes, formerly a Republican congressman, stated that the company's acquisition of TAE would “cement America's global energy dominance for generations.” The companies said they plan to site and begin construction on “the world's first utility-scale fusion power plant (50 MWe)” next year, and have plans for more fusion plants that are expected to generate between 350 megawatts to 500 megawatts of electricity.

But the path forward for fusion power remains uncertain.

Currently, only one experimental device has proven that controlled fusion reactions can generate more power than they consume. Several other companies, including Bill Gates-backed Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Sam Altman-backed Helion, are in the race to put fusion power on the grid sometime in the early 2030s.

If one or more fusion startups succeed, they could deliver gigawatts of clean, continuous power to the grid using nothing more than hydrogen isotopes filtered from seawater. Inside a fusion reactor, those isotopes are heated and compressed until they turn into a plasma. When particles in the plasma collide, they merge to form a new, heavier atom while releasing tremendous amounts of heat, which can be harvested to generate electricity.

TAE has been working on a range of fusion devices since the late 1990s. The company has raised nearly $2 billion in total, including a recent $150 million round from existing investors including Google, Chevron Technology Ventures, and New Enterprise. The company has been valued at about $1.8 billion, according to PitchBook.

Over the years, TAE has struggled to make its various designs work. Its latest effort uses magnetic fields generated by rotating plasma to stabilize the plasma itself. Particle beams bombard the outside of the plasma cloud, helping it to spin.

In the meantime, TAE has also created a new division focused on the life sciences. It is selling a version of its particle accelerator as a radiation treatment for cancer.

After the merger, Nunes and TAE CEO Dr. Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEOs of the combined company.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage G3 showed distinct inflammatory cytokine profiles that correlated with disease progression. Specific cytokine clusters were associated with a faster progression of CKD, increased cardiovascular events, and poor long-term outcomes, including kidney failure and mortality.

""Specific plasma cytokine clusters consisting of four cytokines helped to condense the information contained in a larger cytokine panel and may inform research into novel pathophysiological pathways as well as risk stratification and response to therapy. These clusters may help design clinical trials of anti-inflammatory therapies targeting specific inflammatory cytokines,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Alberto Martínez-Castelao, Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge, Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain. It was published online on December 09, 2025, in Clinical Kidney Journal.

The sample size was small. Data on the temporal sequence between the initiation of KRT and death were not collected. Additionally, the healthy control group used for reference cytokine values was younger than the CKD cohort, which may have influenced the comparison of cytokine profiles.

Four authors reported receiving honoraria for lectures, consultancy fees, speaker fees, and travel support and having other ties with various pharmaceutical companies. Three authors reported being employees of Sysmex, and one author reported holding stocks in Telara Farma.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

Do I not like that.

Electronic Arts' all-conquering EA Sports FC, the game formerly known as FIFA, can now with certainty be called a successful re-branding exercise. EA Sports FC has become a ubiquitous sight at all levels of matches, with it being near-impossible to watch a Premier League game in particular without having the logo tattooed on your eyes by the end. The latest entry in the series has already sold over 10 million copies.

So pity poor FIFA. World football's governing body was left in the lurch by EA (for which it only has itself to blame) and until recently has proven itself utterly clueless about what to do next. FIFA president Gianni Infantino can insist that only a game with the FIFA name will be ""the best"" but so far, outside of a tie-up with the Football Manager series, everything it's tried to do in games has been risible—the Roblox World Cup game that didn't feature any actual football being an especial low point.

FIFA and Netflix have now announced that a new FIFA ""football simulation game"" will release to coincide with next year's World Cup. The game is being developed by Delphi Interactive, which is oddly enough working with IO Interactive on the upcoming 007: First Light but is otherwise yet to release a videogame.

There are only the vaguest of details, no screens of the game, and what we do know… well, it's not exactly promising. Netflix subscribers will be able to play the new FIFA for free via the Netflix app on Android and iOS devices (uh oh), as well as via compatible television sets. There's no mention of a browser option as of yet, though Netflix's dedicated games page (which is linked in the FIFA announcement) suggests this will be an option.

The game will, per the press release, allow players to ""experience the emotion and drama of the tournament in its purest, most joyful form—in a format that's fast to learn, thrilling to master, and built for anyone to jump in."" It will feature both solo play and multiplayer.

Here's one sentence that absolutely no football fan wants to hear, courtesy of Alain Tascan, president of games at Netflix: ""We want to bring football back to its roots with something everyone can play with just the touch of a button.""

 




""Our reimagined game truly marks the beginning of a new era of digital football,"" said Infantino, a man whose words have all the solidity of wind. ""It will be available for free to Netflix members and is a great historic step for FIFA.""

Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

Infantino says the game aims to ""reach billions of football fans of all ages everywhere in the world and will be redefining the pure notion of simulation games.""

Oookay. Casper Daugaard, CEO of Delphi Interactive, said on LinkedIn that ""I am honored to announce Delphi Interactive has been trusted by FIFA to develop and publish the return of its iconic franchise back to simulation gaming. Ours will be the most fun, approachable, and global football game ever created.""

Well, we'll see about that. More details are incoming in 2026, and it will at the very least be interesting to see what Delphi Interactive can do with such a potentially enormous audience, and the dream tie-in with the World Cup. I'm not sure that EA Sports FC enjoyers will be rushing to pick up what sounds like a one-button F2P game built for mobile first… but maybe millions of others will. If nothing else, at least we'll get the spectacle of Infantino making some childish digs at EA when it launches.

EXCLUSIVE: Jason Isaacs (The White Lotus) is the latest addition to the cast of Amazon MGM's live-action Tomb Raider series, sources tell Deadline.


	Reps for Amazon declined to comment and it's not yet clear who Isaacs is playing. As previously announced, Game of Thrones alum Sophie Turner is set for the lead role of Lara Croft, with Sigourney Weaver also eyeing to star.


	Based on the video game franchise, following the adventures of world-famous archaeologist and adventurer Lara Croft (Turner), the Tomb Raider TV series' plot is being kept under wraps.


	Created, written and exec produced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the project has been gestating for some time after first being announced in 2022. It was officially greenlighted in May 2024, with Turner coming aboard to star six months later, and finally begins production on January 19.

	Chad Hodge is co-showrunning, as well as exec producing alongside Jonathan Van Tulleken (Shōgun, Dope Thief), who is also directing. The show is also executive produced by Crystal Dynamics; Waller-Bridge and Jenny Robins through Wells Street Productions; Dmitri M. Johnson, Mike Goldberg and Timothy I. Stevenson through Story Kitchen; Michael Scheel; Hodge; and Legendary Television.


	Coming off his first Emmy nomination and second Golden Globe nomination for his work in the third season of HBO's The White Lotus, Isaacs has a packed slate up ahead with projects like the hostage thriller Eleven Days, Bleecker Street's Victorian Psycho with Maika Monroe, and The Julia Set, a coming-of-age drama we were first to report on that co-stars Chase Infiniti, Christopher Briney, and Gillian Anderson. He is repped by Gersh, Independent Talent Group, and Strand Entertainment.
