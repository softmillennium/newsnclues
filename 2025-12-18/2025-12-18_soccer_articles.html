                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A generational showdown is officially on the calendar as Spain and Argentina prepare to contest the Finalissima in Qatar, setting up a first-ever senior meeting between Lamine Yamal and Lionel Messi. Spain and Argentina have confirmed plans to face each other in the Finalissima, with the intercontinental clash scheduled for March 27 at Lusail Stadium in Qatar. Argentina are the current holders, having defeated Italy 3-0 at Wembley in 2022, while earlier incarnations of the competition saw France beat Uruguay in 1985 and Argentina overcome Denmark on penalties in 1993. The game will see Barcelona prodigy Yamal face Messi for the first time at senior international level, with the teenager likely to line up for Spain against the Argentine captain in a symbolic clash of football's present and future. The Finalissima represents more than just a one-off trophy, acting as a flagship event in the ongoing partnership between UEFA and CONMEBOL. For Argentina, the setting adds a layer of emotional significance as Lusail Stadium is where Messi lifted the World Cup in 2022, ending a 36-year wait for La Albiceleste for football's most coveted prize. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. The spotlight will inevitably fall on the meeting between Yamal and Messi, a pairing that feels almost poetic given their shared connection to Barcelona. Both are left-footed right-wingers, both have worn the iconic No.10 shirt, and both emerged from La Masia as generational talents, albeit at very different stages of their careers. At just 18, Yamal has already become a central figure for both club and country, playing a key role in Spain's European Championship success and regularly drawing comparisons to Messi. The teenager has repeatedly attempted to temper those narratives, insisting he wants to follow his own path rather than be framed as a successor to the Argentine legend. Their relationship, however, stretches back far further than this confirmed meeting. Images of Messi posing with a baby Yamal during a charity calendar shoot in 2007 resurfaced during Euro 2024, while additional photos show the pair together at Barcelona's training ground when Yamal was still an academy player, and Messi was at the peak of his world-beating powers. Attention will now turn to March 27, when Spain and Argentina meet in Qatar for a match that carries both sporting and symbolic weight. Spain and Argentina are among the favourites for the expanded tournament, and the Finalissima offers a rare chance to test themselves against elite opposition outside their respective confederations.</p>

The MBTA has released early transportation guidance for visitors ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, as officials prepare for an estimated 450,000 fans traveling to the Boston area next summer. “The MBTA fully understands the critical role it will play in moving soccer fans next year, and we expect to transport up to 20,000 riders in and out of each match,” MBTA representative Lisa Battiston wrote in an e-mail to Boston.com. It will release service schedules, ticket information, and more in the coming months on MBTA.com/WorldCup. Boston Stadium will host seven games this summer from June 13 to July 9, which includes five group stage games, a Round of 32 matchup, and a quarterfinal. Ticket prices range from $180 to $1,270 for the events in Boston. The guide also states: “You must have a ticket to a World Cup match to buy Boston Stadium Train tickets.” “None of us want transportation to be the story when the World Cup is here,” MBTA General Manager Phillip Eng told Boston25 News. The transit agency included guides on airport transportation and how to use the T, including ferry, bus, commuter rail, and subway service. Work at Foxboro Station has been underway since August and is expected to conclude by June 2026. The $35 million renovation aims to expand capacity and improve accessibility ahead of World Cup influx. Stay up to date with everything Boston.

Electronic Arts' all-conquering EA Sports FC, the game formerly known as FIFA, can now with certainty be called a successful re-branding exercise. EA Sports FC has become a ubiquitous sight at all levels of matches, with it being near-impossible to watch a Premier League game in particular without having the logo tattooed on your eyes by the end. World football's governing body was left in the lurch by EA (for which it only has itself to blame) and until recently has proven itself utterly clueless about what to do next. FIFA president Gianni Infantino can insist that only a game with the FIFA name will be "the best" but so far, outside of a tie-up with the Football Manager series, everything it's tried to do in games has been risible—the Roblox World Cup game that didn't feature any actual football being an especial low point. FIFA and Netflix have now announced that a new FIFA "football simulation game" will release to coincide with next year's World Cup. There are only the vaguest of details, no screens of the game, and what we do know… well, it's not exactly promising. Netflix subscribers will be able to play the new FIFA for free via the Netflix app on Android and iOS devices (uh oh), as well as via compatible television sets. There's no mention of a browser option as of yet, though Netflix's dedicated games page (which is linked in the FIFA announcement) suggests this will be an option. It will feature both solo play and multiplayer. Here's one sentence that absolutely no football fan wants to hear, courtesy of Alain Tascan, president of games at Netflix: "We want to bring football back to its roots with something everyone can play with just the touch of a button." Casper Daugaard, CEO of Delphi Interactive, said on LinkedIn that "I am honored to announce Delphi Interactive has been trusted by FIFA to develop and publish the return of its iconic franchise back to simulation gaming. Ours will be the most fun, approachable, and global football game ever created." More details are incoming in 2026, and it will at the very least be interesting to see what Delphi Interactive can do with such a potentially enormous audience, and the dream tie-in with the World Cup. I'm not sure that EA Sports FC enjoyers will be rushing to pick up what sounds like a one-button F2P game built for mobile first… but maybe millions of others will. If nothing else, at least we'll get the spectacle of Infantino making some childish digs at EA when it launches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Soccer has announced the details of two upcoming lotteries for World Cup tickets. FIFA allocates eight percent of tickets for each match to participating member associations (PMA), and U.S. Soccer will distribute its allotment through two weighted draws. "Quantities will vary by stadium, and demand is expected to significantly exceed supply," the federation said. The two draws are exclusively for members of U.S. Soccer's Insider program, which is available in eight different tiers. Of U.S. Soccer's allotted tickets, 10 percent will be available in a draw for Standard Insider members, who do not pay a fee. The federation is conducting a second draw that will include 90 percent of its tickets. "For fans whose long-term commitment enables U.S. Soccer to remain in service to the game, we've designed a draw that recognizes and rewards that support," the federation said. Eligible Insiders will receive access codes to apply for tickets in early January, with applications remaining open until Jan. 13. Under heavy criticism, FIFA announced this week that it would be offering a small subset of fans access to $60 tickets for all 104 matches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anfield future questions are also being asked of £116m ($155m) playmaker Florian Wirtz, while talk of Jurgen Klopp returning to Merseyside in a managerial capacity has been addressed by a former Reds star. Liverpool smashed all kinds of recruitment records in 2025 when embarking on an elaborate spending spree. Having recaptured the Premier League title, Arne Slot was handed a historic warchest with which to work. Germany international Wirtz briefly became the most expensive player in British football when moving to Anfield from Bayer Leverkusen, before that bar was raised again when Isak completed a protracted switch from Newcastle. Asked about Isak's situation, with the 26-year-old netting just two goals through 15 appearances and struggling for full match sharpness throughout his time with the Reds, Hamann told JeffBet: “I'm not sure Liverpool will sell anyone in January, but if things don't pick up for Alexander Isak come March or April, they'll probably have discussions to sell him to a club like Barcelona in the summer. There will be plenty of takers for Isak because he's shown his ability at Newcastle. It also largely depends on the form of [Hugo] Ekitike, because if he continues to improve, it will be a struggle for Isak to get games unless he's forced out wide.” Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Liverpool haven't been big spenders before last summer and they tend to spend the money wisely. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting It has been suggested that some familiar faces could be targeted if a change in the dugout is made. On links to a legendary former club captain, Hamann said: “Steven Gerrard loves Liverpool, if he's asked to fill in as an interim manager, there is every chance he'd do it. “It could absolutely boost his management career and there aren't many better places to get in the spotlight than Liverpool. It would be a fantastic opportunity for Gerrard to help manage his hometown club. Hamann added on the reports claiming that Klopp - who stepped down as Reds boss in 2024 - could be lured back to Anfield: “I think Jurgen Klopp is happy at Red Bull. But, I think it would be a wonderful story if Klopp returned to Liverpool. That trip will be made without Mohamed Salah, with the Egyptian superstar - who returned to favour in a win over Brighton last time out following his explosive rant against the Reds - now on Africa Cup of Nations duty.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the past, a fan's ability to attend a World Cup hosted in their nation hinged more on bid books than their checkbooks. The analysis is based on official Fifa pricing dating back to 1994, with more robust data available starting in 2006. It's important to note that Fifa's dynamic pricing model could see prices for any game fluctuate between now and the tournament. But for traveling fans – especially those from the four countries who may face visa restrictions – waiting until the last minute to get tickets may not be desirable or feasible. Category 4 is historically the lowest price point for World Cups, and was previously exclusively available to residents of a hosting nation. In 2026, not only are the “cheap seats” at least three times pricier in most rounds than they were when Qatar hosted in 2022, there were so few Category 4 seats available that the whole tournament's inventory sold out before sales opened to the general public, per Fifa. Meanwhile, the nascent round of 32 born from an expanded field is priced similarly to group games. The limited number of $60 seats at every game with prices capped still represents a five-fold increase over 2022's Category 4 group-stage entry point. Dynamic pricing, introduced for this tournament, has been cited as the primary driver of these price increases. The practice allows prices for each game to change based on demand, and that demand has changed markedly since the World Cup draw. Before that point, every game had unknown participants except the nine involving host nations. Afterward, teams were assigned matchups and venues, so people for the first time knew who would be playing. Compared with pre-draw ticket prices for each of their group games, Portugal saw the steepest price increases – which can be chalked up to the Cristiano Ronaldo factor. Lionel Messi's World Cup-holding Argentina come in second. Notably, matches involving Iran were the only ones to see a double-digit percentage decrease. The percentages listed below reflect the post-draw pricing compared with initial pricing for each match as specified by its date and venue. In total, 91 of the 104 matches saw price increases after December's draw. No matter what you end up paying, it's likely going to be a far cry from the pricing model promised during the bid process in 2018, held during Donald Trump's first term. This is from the bid book submitted to Fifa: At the time, the United 2026 organizers strove to start group-game pricing for Category 4 at $21 – within a dollar of 2018's welcoming price when accounting for inflation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DR Congo's hopes of qualifying for a maiden World Cup appear to be in jeopardy after the Nigeria Football Federation confirmed it had submitted a petition to FIFA over alleged 'fraudulent' practices by the Central Africans. Sebastien Desabre's men are now set to face the winner of the New Caledonia vs. Jamaica tie, with the victor advancing to Group K alongside Portugal, Uzbekistan, and Colombia. However, the NFF claimed they formally lodged a complaint with the football ruling body, challenging the eligibility of several DR Congo players who reportedly changed nationalities without proper clearance. "There are players that got theirs (passport) in just two or three months. "The Congolese law says you cannot have dual nationality. "FIFA regulation states once you have a passport of your country, you are eligible but our contention is FIFA was deceived into clearing them. Per Flashscore.com findings, at least nine players were flagged as ineligible, including Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Axel Tuanzebe, and Arthur Masuaku. Cameroon had earlier raised similar concerns about European-born players representing DR Congo, but the Congolese dismissed the allegations as unfounded. Now, Nigeria's petition could trigger a review that might have major consequences for the Leopards' World Cup aspirations. Meanwhile, the Congolese Football Federation (FECOFA) has dismissed the NFF's protest, describing it as an attempt to succeed through the ‘back door' and tagging Nigeria a bad loser. Under DR Congo law, dual citizenship is generally not recognised, meaning players who hold or recently held foreign passports may technically be ineligible to represent the country.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The home of the NFL's New York Giants and Jets is set to host eight matches for next year's tournament, including five group stage matches and the final on July 19. Earlier this month, soccer fans learned that MetLife Stadium would be the venue for traditional soccer heavyweights Brazil, France, Germany, and England to duke it out during the group stage. “This is going to be the biggest thing that this city in this region has ever hosted, and people are going to have a great experience, traveling to the game and traveling back from the game.” However, during this summer's Club World Cup — a dress rehearsal for next year's showpiece event, a significant minority of fans experienced long train delays and system malfunctions. NJ Transit, which runs trains from New York Penn Station to Secaucus Junction and further onto East Meadowlands — MetLife Stadium's stop — moved around 153,000 people this summer. AmNY previously reported delays for the lesser-attended matches. The stadium has also had trouble with past large-scale events, such as Super Bowl XLVIII and WrestleMania 2019, leaving fans at both events stranded on the East Meadowlands platform for hours. When the World Cup rolls around next summer, fans will most likely pack out the 82,500 seats in MetLife Stadium, especially when stars like Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe roll into town. The public transportation system has pledged to increase its capacity to accommodate 12,000 people per hour for the tournament, while Lasry said they will be initiating a “massive messaging plan” for non-New Yorkers to navigate the public transportation system. “Transportation is a key part, and it's why we were awarded the finals,” Lasry said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nigeria have taken their World Cup heartbreak off the pitch and into FIFA's disciplinary chambers, filing a formal protest alleging the Democratic Republic of Congo fielded ineligible players during their decisive African qualification playoff. The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) confirmed it has petitioned FIFA over DR Congo's use of several dual-nationality players in last month's playoff final, which the Congolese side won on penalties to keep alive their hopes of reaching the 2026 World Cup in North America. At the heart of Nigeria's complaint is an argument that goes beyond FIFA statutes and into domestic law. The NFF contends that multiple DR Congo players were cleared by FIFA despite allegedly failing to meet Congolese nationality requirements, which, according to Nigerian officials, do not permit dual citizenship. “The Congolese rules say you cannot have dual nationality,” NFF general secretary Mohammed Sanusi told reporters. “There are so many of them that have European passports – French, Dutch and others. “But our contention is that FIFA was deceived into clearing them. Nigeria's petition alleges that between six and nine players, many of them Europe-based and born or raised abroad, retained foreign passports despite representing DR Congo. Under Congolese law, Nigeria argues, players must renounce other citizenships to hold full nationality, a step it claims was not taken. DR Congo's football federation, Fecofa, swiftly rejected the allegations, accusing Nigeria of attempting to overturn a result they failed to win on the field. “If you cannot win on the pitch, then do not try to win from the back door,” Fecofa said in a social media statement. Fecofa insists all players were properly vetted and approved by FIFA in advance, stressing that FIFA regulations – not national citizenship laws – govern eligibility in international football. FIFA did not immediately comment on the case, which is now before its disciplinary bodies. No timeline has been announced for a ruling, though similar eligibility cases have taken weeks or months to resolve. The dispute also highlights a long-running fault line in African football, where national citizenship laws sometimes clash with FIFA's global eligibility framework and the widespread use of diaspora players. Several African teams, including DR Congo, Morocco and Senegal, have built competitive squads by drawing on players developed in Europe.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The sales process for FIFA World Cup tickets officially began in September 2025, with the first allocation reserved for sponsors, Visa's official presale. This was followed in October by an early-entry ballot, before the larger random selection draw opened on 11 December, set to run through 13 January 2026. Following the release of prices, the initial reaction among fans has been overwhelmingly negative, as a tournament long seen as accessible to millions worldwide now appears increasingly restricted to those with the financial means to attend. Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise. Supporting your national team at a World Cup is never inexpensive, with fans required to absorb high costs beyond tickets, including travel and accommodation. Source [2] BBC [3*] GlobalData Post Event Report (FIFA World Cup 2022) Don't let policy changes catch you off guard. Fan discontent has prompted calls for action from several supporters' groups and national governing bodies. Football Supporters Europe (FSE) has labelled the pricing extortionate and has called on FIFA to immediately halt ticket sales, seeking greater engagement through consultation and a full review. This has occurred, with Cape Verde, Curaçao, Jordan, and Uzbekistan all qualifying for the 2026 competition for the first time in their history. Haiti is among the poorest nations in the world, with an average monthly wage of around $147, meaning a full month's income would not cover a single match ticket. This figure also excludes additional costs: long-haul flights from Haiti average $652, and, when combined with a base hotel cost of $120, the total reaches $952—equivalent to more than five months of the national average income. Under Swiss law, FIFA is a non-profit organization, meaning its revenue from activities such as competition ticket sales is reinvested in the sport globally. Based on an average Category 4 ticket price of $93 and an average stadium capacity of 63,134, this equates to an additional 2.53 million fans in stadiums, representing a potential $253.29 million in incremental ticket revenue from the extra matches alone. Soccer is the most popular sport in the world, but this popularity is increasingly being exploited by those in charge. The reality for FIFA is that, despite high prices, fans are so eager to experience the World Cup that they are willing to pay a premium. Pricing also aligns more closely with the North American market in 2026. While domestic soccer is cheaper on average—for example, the average adult season ticket in the English Premier League equates to £32.53 ($44)—top US- and Canada-based sports leagues command significantly higher premiums. With high prices seemingly not fully derailing fan interest, it also supports FIFA president Gianni Infantino's personal agenda, delivering the highest revenue from a World Cup in history, and aiding his personal re-election campaign in 2027. The critical response and backlash to the ticket prices have since led FIFA to make a small concession, introducing a ‘small number' of more affordable tickets, priced at $60 (£45) for all 104 matches of the tournament. The reality is that this is a very small concession, which only on the face of it appears to show FIFA as having responded to unpopular opinion. The new, cheaper tickets will only be available within the ‘supporter entry' tier and cover 10% of this supporter allocation for each national soccer federation. The small concession does very little for fans or FIFA alike, as FIFA is still set to extract maximum value from the bulk of its tickets, and fans are still largely subjected to high costs.
