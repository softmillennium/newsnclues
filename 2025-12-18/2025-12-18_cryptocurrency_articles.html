                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fold now offers Bitcoin services nationwide via its partnership with federally chartered BitGo Bank & Trust. Fold Holdings, Inc. ($FLD), a publicly traded Bitcoin financial services company, just announced that its platform is now available in all 50 U.S. states. The move marks a rare milestone in U.S. consumer Bitcoin services: Fold is the first platform to operate nationwide under a single federally supervised trust framework. Previously, state-by-state licensing and regulatory barriers constrained consumer access, particularly in states like New York. With BitGo's charter, Fold can now provide Bitcoin exchange and custody services across the entire country, including historically restrictive markets, this is according to the company's statement shared with Bitcoin Magazine. “BitGo B&T's federal bank charter combined with Fold's Bitcoin financial products gives the U.S. its first true national framework for Bitcoin access,” said CEO Will Reeves. Reeves emphasized that nationwide availability allows the company to scale its offerings and deliver Bitcoin products in line with federal oversight. BitGo provides the digital asset infrastructure through its Crypto-as-a-Service platform, enabling them to operate within a federally supervised compliance framework while continuing to innovate in rewards, payments, and custody services. Access has been limited by geography, but with a national framework, both companies can now operate as intended — responsibly and across the entire U.S.” This partnership positions FLD to capture a wider audience while aligning consumer crypto services with federal standards.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To the dismay of the bulls, crypto markets continued with their whipsawing action again on Thursday, with large early gains being more than reversed over a very short time frame. The Nasdaq was off session highs of about 2%, but still sharply ahead with a 1.7% advance. That data had some quickly penciling in another Federal Reserve rate cut in January, which — all things being equal — would tend to be good for risk assets, including crypto. "Major issue was zeroing out rent/owner's equivalent rent (OER) in October," wrote well-followed economist Omair Sharif. Unless the BLS adjusts, he continued, it will artificially lower year-over-year CPI prints until April There is just no world in which this was a good idea." At the moment, markets appear to be agreeing with the skeptics, with odds of a January rate cut not having budged from their previous slim 24% chance. Traders in the crypto options market appear to be adjusting their expectations, with bitcoin and ether ETH$2,837.03 showing diverging sentiment, according to data from Wintermute. Ether options, by contrast, show less conviction and more hedging behavior. Support appears to be forming around the $2,700 to $2,800 range, but upside calls above $3,100 are being sold aggressively, suggesting traders are seeking protection over upside.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The program, locally named ENRA, began in November 2025 and delivers quarterly payments to eligible residents, providing essential financial services across the country's remote and geographically dispersed islands. This initiative coincides with growing institutional activity on Stellar, including pilot projects by major financial players exploring blockchain-based dollar tokenization. SDF issued a multimillion-dollar grant to facilitate USDM1's development and deployment, marking the first large-scale use of blockchain for government welfare. Citizens can receive their quarterly payments either through traditional banking methods or directly via USDM1 tokens in Lomalo, a mobile app purpose‑built for RMI and powered by Crossmint wallets on Stellar. Denelle Dixon, CEO and Executive Director of SDF, said Every day, people can receive and spend money onchain, and get access to basic financial services that they have been shut out of in the traditional financial system.” Previously, UBI and other government payments relied on cash deliveries via official transport vessels, which were slow, costly, and limited in reach. With USDM1 and Lomalo, citizens in remote atolls can now receive their funds within seconds, bypassing traditional logistical challenges. Funding for the UBI program is tied in part to the country's sovereign trust arrangements, including compensation-linked funds connected to historical U.S. nuclear testing. While early reactions highlight the efficiency and auditability of on-chain payments, the government acknowledges ongoing challenges, including digital literacy, smartphone access, and connectivity gaps in remote areas. Still, the Marshall Islands' experiment is being closely watched as a real-world test of whether public blockchains like Stellar can reliably support large-scale government welfare programs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto market has turned red today, with tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP trading lower. Even though some positive economic news has come out, traders are still selling risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is trading near $88,100, down about 2% in the past day. Many investors are locking in profits after Bitcoin's strong run earlier this year. At the same time, there are concerns that if prices fall further, leveraged positions tied to Bitcoin ETFs could face liquidation pressure. Ethereum has fallen to around $2,940, down more than 2% in 24 hours. XRP is also under pressure, trading near $1.90, down about 4% for the day. Solana, Dogecoin, and other major altcoins are also posting losses, showing that selling pressure is widespread. Normally, lower inflation and rate cuts are seen as good for risk assets like crypto. Many traders are choosing to wait for clearer signals before jumping back in. Despite bullish comments from some analysts who say this news should help crypto move higher, investors remain bearish for now. Concerns about ETF-related selling, global economic uncertainty, and recent price volatility are keeping buyers on the sidelines. Until confidence improves, crypto prices may continue to move lower or sideways in the short term. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What do a holding company for the U.S. president's media ventures and a nuclear fusion company have to gain from joining forces? And what does it mean for Trump Media's digital asset treasury partnership with Crypto.com? TAE Technologies is a privately held fusion energy company based in California. The firm's main focus is on developing nuclear fusion systems, a technology that has not yet achieved commercial viability. In the meantime, TAE operates other business lines selling power management systems for electric vehicles and particle accelerators for the medical sector. The merger with Trump Media will give TAE Technologies a foothold in the public market, with the combined entity valued at more than $8 billion in an all-stock deal that grants an equal stake to shareholders of both companies. Statements  issued by TAE and Trump Media suggest the latter's “access to significant capital” is the primary motivation for teaming up. Beyond building power stations, the deal with TAE Technologies could have implications for Trump Media's various crypto ventures. After all, the $300 million Trump Media will inject into TAE is money it won't be able to spend on initiatives like the CRO treasury company it set up with Crypto.com. When that partnership was announced in August, media coverage focused on the headline figure of $6.4 billion. But in reality, most of that value is attributed to a $5 billion line of credit that neither company is obliged to utilize. Now, with Trump Media's money and attention focused elsewhere, it seems even less likely the company would want to take on additional debt at a time when the digital asset treasury trend has lost much of its lustre.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This breakdown marks a shift in market structure, as $3,000 now transitions from support into resistance. This level previously acted as a major area of balance, where significant trading volume accumulated. Since breaking below the Point of Control, Ethereum has attempted minor relief rallies. However, these moves have been rejected almost “to the dollar,” reinforcing $3,000 as a firm resistance zone. From a technical standpoint, this behavior suggests that buyers lack the capacity to regain control. At the same time, sellers continue to defend lower prices aggressively, a dynamic that increases downside risk for BMNR stock as Ethereum's technical pattern becomes more concerning. Such corrective bounces are common during downtrends and often precede further downside rather than sustained recoveries. Since Ethereum established a local low near the $2,600 region, liquidity has steadily built beneath that area. Markets tend to seek out these liquidity pools, especially when bearish momentum remains intact and structural support levels fail. The next major downside target sits near $2,500, a high-time-frame support region that aligns with previous consolidation and structural demand. Capitulation typically involves accelerated selling, forced liquidations, and emotional exits, marking the final phase of a corrective move. Recent downside moves have exhibited greater participation than upside attempts, indicating that sell-side pressure remains dominant. Until Ethereum can reclaim $3,000 with substantial volume and hold above it, bullish scenarios remain secondary. That said, capitulation zones often create conditions for longer-term stabilization once liquidity is fully cleared.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has launched an investigation into a major data breach that affected thousands of film and TV workers. Deadline revealed in October that members of the Bectu union had personal details breached in a cyber attack on Prospect, Bectu's parent union. Member information accessed included bank details, contact details, and “personal identifiers” like birth dates and protected characteristics. It was not clear how many people were impacted, but sources said that it was likely to be the majority of Bectu's 40,000 members. John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner, said: “When people share their most sensitive information with an organisation, they do so with the expectation that it will be handled responsibly and securely. “We will be scrutinising the cyber incident at Prospect to check whether those expectations were met. This joint investigation demonstrates our determination to work more closely with our international counterparts to ensure that data protection standards are upheld across all jurisdictions.” Prospect general secretary Mike Clancy wrote to staff on Thursday to inform them of the ICO investigation (email below). In a statement, the union said: “In June 2025 the union experienced a cybersecurity incident affecting our servers. As the announcement notes, the opening of this investigation should not be taken to mean that the ICO has reached a conclusion that Prospect has infringed data protection law. We will continue to co-operate fully with their investigation as it continues. “The union's National Executive Committee has also commissioned its own independent review into the incident and will keep members updated as that progresses. “We take our responsibilities to our members incredibly seriously and are deeply sorry for any impact on them. These kinds of incidents are sadly becoming more common, and we encourage members to utilise the support we have offered if they have not yet done so.” Dear colleagueI am writing to make you aware that the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has decided to announce publicly that they are investigating the cyber incident that took place earlier in the year.Last year the ICO completed 179 investigations and in general they do not make announcements until the investigation has reached some conclusions. The important point for any members concerned is that the Experian Credit monitoring remains available to sign up to until the end of the year and will then run for a year from that point, so if they have not signed up for this yet we would still urge them to do so.This situation is fluid and we will do our best to keep you informed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But that is also bringing different investment results, with leverage, high valuations and funding concerns among the factors that have hurt various corners of the crypto markets. Bitcoin treasury companies, led by Strategy Inc, have suffered even more. These companies hold a significant portion of their corporate assets in cryptocurrencies ‌as a treasury reserve and often raise capital through stock or debt to acquire more digital assets. For years, their share ‌prices traded at a premium to the value of the bitcoin they owned and many investors assumed that premium would keep growing forever. Japan's Metaplanet and a long list of smaller imitators were hit just as hard. “Investors are now a lot more cautious of overpaying for those.” These firms, which secured cheap electricity under long-term contracts, are now pivoting to AI data centers for tech giants. But many saw weakness on concerns about some of these companies' profitability as they carry heavy debt and constantly need fresh cash ​to pay for the switch. “The macro environment turned a little bit and those companies got punished,” Sigel said. Morgan Stanley estimates U.S. data centers are facing a power shortfall of 47 gigawatts through 2028, but notes that converting crypto miners could alleviate a significant portion, potentially 10-15 GW or more. “If you want to get a company with exposure to crypto, but also with exposure to an important growth story for the next five or ten years with the development of AI data centers, you've got to look at a lot of these miners,” said Brian Dobson, managing director of disruptive technology equity research at Clear Street. For some companies, a solution to poor ‍performance rests with offering actively managed and/or hedged strategies that can outperform during drawdowns. Sigel's VanEck Onchain Economy ETF has seen a 32% return since the fund launched in May this year by deliberately underweighting over-leveraged names, he said. Activist investor Eric Jackson's EMJ Crypto Technologies (EMJX) has developed the ‍first actively hedged digital-asset treasury holding bitcoin, ethereum and selective alts, which also generates yield by selling options instead of ​repeatedly issuing equity or debt. Harvard University's endowment now holds BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust as its largest publicly disclosed stock position. Sovereign wealth funds in Luxembourg, Abu Dhabi and the Czech Republic are building stakes. As more investment choices appear, Coinbase's D'Agostino argues that the overall market is starting to look like traditional commodities or stocks with regulated exchanges, safe custody options, and precise tools to bet on price direction, volatility, or steady income.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here are 5 altcoins that should do well next year. All these altcoins have key catalysts ahead that could reshape their value. In this video, I walk through each pick. My first pick, in this list of altcoins, isn't an altcoin at all. That's right, it's the crypto OG himself, Bitcoin ($BTC). It's your hedge against a crumbling dollar value. We can also see that institutional adoption is speeding up. Big institutional investors are increasingly embracing Bitcoin. These are companies that strategically hold cryptocurrencies on their balance sheet for investment. This way, Bitcoin receives legitimacy beyond speculation. Michael Saylor and his Strategy are the perfect example for such a DAT. But we also start to see this with other cryptos. Major forecasts still point to strong long-term gains. This underscores continued confidence in $BTC's growth potential relative to traditional assets. So, even with short-term dips, many analysts see further gains. They credit this to increased demand, shrinking supply, and cycle dynamics. The #Bitcoin Power Curve Cycle Cloud predicts a peak of around $250,000-$300,000 in 2026. pic.twitter.com/dwt67rMvnX Given this rising institutional interest, my portfolio will for 30% consist of $BTC. However, keep in mind, once $BTC hits $170k, or higher, it doesn't matter whether you bought it at $85k or $92k. Ethereum ($ETH) is my next pick of this list for altcoins in 2026. However, it seems that Buterin is turning things around. The recent Fusaka upgrade can well put Ethereum back on my radar. Yes, I know, it always had that first mover advantage. This Fusaka upgrade changed a few things. So, check out my recent video about this Fusaka upgrade. It has been a massive move for Ethereum. Like Bitcoin, institutional interest is also big for Ethereum. Both have plenty of ETFs, with more to come. We have already seen various institutions showing interest in the Sui Network. 21Shares is now offering 2x leveraged SUI ETF (TXXS) on the Nasdaq. We also know that Sui already offers a wide variety of stablecoins. In June 2026, 3 more European stablecoins will join. These are the MICA-regulated stablecoins $EURXM, $USDXM, and $RONXM. It's another sign of how important payments and stablecoins are for Sui's long term growth. EURXM, USDXM, and RONXM are coming – three MiCA-regulated stablecoins launching in June 2026, built for real payments. RWAs are also the talk of crypto town. Sagint now picked Sui as its Layer 1 chain partner. Sagint brings tokenized, traceable digital assets for critical minerals to Sui. Sui will allow for tracking the supply chain of these minerals. Today, in a step forward for real world asset tokenization on Sui,@SagintInc announces it has selected Sui as its Layer 1 blockchain partner. You may know that Bhutan already mined around 13,000 $BTC. However, it's located in the remote Himalayas. So, Sui successfully tested how blockchain can function without internet. In Bhutan's remote valleys, our team tested how blockchain can function when the internet disappears. We explored offline signing, physical data movement, and onchain verification using Sui. I will reserve the last 20% of my portfolio in 2026 for $SUI. So, check out my recent video on this event. This is a big event for Bittensor. But, as I explain in that video, Bittensor took inspiration from $BTC, but it's certainly not a copy. The tokenomics are similar, with a 21 million max $TAO cap and halvings. However, mining couldn't be more different. This translates to the amount of $TAO they receive. A very different game compared to Bitcoin. And don't underestimate the current AI boom we see. Bittensor is the leading crypto AI project. Chainlink on this list takes care of the infrastructure. However, Bittensor is where it really happens. This is our big AI favorite at Altcoin Buzz. Now, I've been talking about Ondo and RWA for a long time. RWAs have all the ingredients to become massive. All the big financial players are betting heavily on this. Think of BlackRock and other big players. However, we can add another massive development. Tokenization is shaping the next evolution of global markets. It holds stocks and bonds electronically on behalf of financial institutions. This is a subsidiary of the DTCC. The DTCC settles about 3.7 quadrillion dollars every year. Tokenization will start for real right now. The current $ONDO price is around 41 cents. Check my recent video on how much $ONDO you need to become a millionaire.
