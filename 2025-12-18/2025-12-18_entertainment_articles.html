                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reps for Amazon declined to comment and it's not yet clear who Isaacs is playing. As previously announced, Game of Thrones alum Sophie Turner is set for the lead role of Lara Croft, with Sigourney Weaver also eyeing to star. Created, written and exec produced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the project has been gestating for some time after first being announced in 2022. It was officially greenlighted in May 2024, with Turner coming aboard to star six months later, and finally begins production on January 19. Chad Hodge is co-showrunning, as well as exec producing alongside Jonathan Van Tulleken (Shōgun, Dope Thief), who is also directing. The show is also executive produced by Crystal Dynamics; Waller-Bridge and Jenny Robins through Wells Street Productions; Dmitri M. Johnson, Mike Goldberg and Timothy I. Stevenson through Story Kitchen; Michael Scheel; Hodge; and Legendary Television. Coming off his first Emmy nomination and second Golden Globe nomination for his work in the third season of HBO's The White Lotus, Isaacs has a packed slate up ahead with projects like the hostage thriller Eleven Days, Bleecker Street's Victorian Psycho with Maika Monroe, and The Julia Set, a coming-of-age drama we were first to report on that co-stars Chase Infiniti, Christopher Briney, and Gillian Anderson. He is repped by Gersh, Independent Talent Group, and Strand Entertainment. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gil Gerard, best known for starring in “Buck Rogers in the 25th Century,” has died at 82 after battling cancer. The actor is remembered for his legacy and candor. Gerard died Tuesday in Georgia after battling “a rare and viciously aggressive form of cancer,” his wife, Janet, announced in a Facebook post. The Arkansas-born actor became a familiar face on television through sci-fi and drama, and in an unusually candid later chapter of his life. William Anthony “Buck” Rogers, a NASA and U.S. Air Force pilot accidentally frozen in space and awakened centuries later, in NBC's “Buck Rogers in the 25th Century.” The lighthearted sci-fi series ran from 1979 to 1981 and was preceded by a feature-length television movie that became an unexpected hit. Gerard later admitted he was hesitant to take it on. “I saw what it did to Adam West's career with Batman, and this was another cartoon character. I didn't want to do this campy stuff,” he said in a 2018 interview. The series ran for two seasons, producing 32 episodes, and ended in April 1981. In later years, Gerard reflected on what made the character resonate with audiences. “I thought the character had a sense of reality about him,” he said in 2017. He wasn't a stiff kind of guy. He was a guy who could solve problems on his feet, and he wasn't a superhero.” Born Gilbert Cyril Gerard on January 23, 1943, in Little Rock, Arkansas, he was the youngest of three boys. After graduating from Little Rock Catholic High, Gerard studied at Arkansas State Teacher College before moving to New York in 1969. One passenger helped him land an audition for “Love Story.” Though his scene was cut, Gerard worked on the film for weeks and soon found steady work in commercials, appearing in more than 400 ads by his own count, as confirmed by The Hollywood Reporter. Gerard later spoke candidly about lifelong struggles with weight and health. He became the focus of the 2007 Discovery Health Channel documentary “Action Hero Makeover,” which followed his decision to undergo gastric bypass surgery after his weight reached 350 pounds. In a 1990 interview with People, Gerard estimated that overeating had cost him nearly $1 million in lost work opportunities over the years. In a final message shared on his Facebook account, Gerard reflected on his life with gratitude and perspective. For fans of classic television and science fiction, Gil Gerard leaves behind a legacy rooted in humor, honesty, and a hero who felt unmistakably human.

He doesn't have to beat himself up anymore." James Cameron says Matt Damon‘s viral claim of rejecting the lead role in Avatar — and losing out on a massive payday — isn't entirely accurate. “You will never meet an actor who turned down more money than me … I was in the middle of shooting the Bourne movie and I would have to leave the movie kind of early and leave them in the lurch a little bit and I didn't want to do that … [Cameron] was really lovely, he said: ‘If you don't do this, this movie doesn't really need you. It doesn't need a movie star at all. 'Avatar' Box Office Preview: 'Fire and Ash' Vies to Join Brethren on All-Time Chart Given that Avatar grossed $2.9 billion, the claim suggests Damon lost potentially hundreds of millions by rejecting the film and, by extension, its two subsequent sequels. But Cameron says — to quote Rose in Titanic — that the reality is “somewhat different.” Then we wound up on a call and he said, ‘I love to explore doing a movie with you. But I really have to do this Jason Bourne movie. Added Cameron: “Now what he's done is he's extrapolated ‘I get 10 percent of the gross on all my films.' And if, in his mind, that's what it would've taken for him to do Avatar, then it wouldn't have happened. “So he's off the hook and doesn't have to beat himself up anymore,” Cameron playfully adds. Cameron added that he respects Damon and thought it was classy of the actor to reach out and noted that turning down a movie due to a prior commitment is an “ethical” move. “He felt compelled to call me personally and tell me; he said he didn't want it to come from the agent — that's an honorable guy,” Cameron says. It was a conflation of different things that were happening.” In the latest film, Fire and Ash, Worthington arguably gives his best performance in the franchise yet. “Sam's character is challenged in ways he hasn't been before, and I think Sam as an actor has grown,” Cameron says. “Not that he was ever not raw and real and authentic, but I think he's grown in the wisdom of his choices.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day A scoop-driven, insider view of Hollywood's genre and blockbuster movie landscape, led by Borys Kit and Aaron Couch.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: YouTube has terminated two prominent channels that used artificial intelligence to create fake movie trailers, Deadline can reveal. The Google-owned video giant has switched off Screen Culture and KH Studio, which together boasted well over 2 million subscribers and more than a billion views. Screen Culture and KH Studio were approached for comment. They are based in India and Georgia, respectively. Earlier this year, YouTube suspended ads on Screen Culture and KH Studio following a Deadline investigation into fake movie trailers plaguing the platform since the rise of generative AI. The channels later returned to monetization when they started adding “fan trailer,” “parody” and “concept trailer” to their video titles. YouTube's position is that the channels' decision to revert to their previous behavior violated its spam and misleading-metadata policies. Deadline's investigation revealed that Screen Culture spliced together official footage with AI images to create franchise trailers that duped many YouTube viewers. Screen Culture founder Nikhil P. Chaudhari said his team of a dozen editors exploited YouTube's algorithm by being early with fake trailers and constantly iterating with videos. For example, Screen Culture had created 23 versions of a trailer for The Fantastic Four: First Steps by March, some of which outranked the official trailer in YouTube search results. More recent examples include HBO's new Harry Potter series and Netflix's Wednesday. Our deep dive into fake trailers revealed that instead of protecting copyright on these videos, a handful of Hollywood studios, including Warner Bros Discovery and Sony, secretly asked YouTube to ensure that the ad revenue from the AI-heavy videos flowed in their direction. Disney properties featured prominently on Screen Culture and KH Studio. The Mouse House sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google last week, claiming that its AI training models and services infringe on its copyrights on a “massive scale.” Want to know more about how AI is disrupting the entertainment business?

Jessica Chastain‘s Apple TV series “The Savant” may be on hold, but her latest movie, out in February, is explosive enough to cause a new controversy on its own. Comfort-cinema-opposed Mexican filmmaker Michel Franco brushed against hope and tenderness with his 2023 dementia-added love story “Memory,” but he's back in a pissed-off minor key over the state of the world — and especially the toxic codependence between the U.S. and his home country — in “Dreams.” Back then, Franco shot his ninth feature on location in the San Francisco Bay Area, courtesy of an interim waiver, and with “Memory” star Jessica Chastain, newcomer Isaac Hernández, and Rupert Friend in the cast. It went on to premiere at the 2025 Berlin Film Festival, unfortunately winning no awards from Todd Haynes' jury, and finally secured distribution from Greenwich Entertainment earlier this year. Related Stories Alejandro G. Iñárritu's Tom Cruise Movie Officially Titled ‘Digger,' Reveals First Look Teaser Jafar Panahi and Abbas Kiarostami Retrospective Set for IFC Center In “Dreams,” Chastain plays a wealthy San Francisco arts patron whose life has been coddled and conflict-free, thanks to her powerful father. With a special interest in the ballet, she falls for a much-younger rising dancer (Hernández) while on a “business” trip to Mexico City, and he winds up illegally crossing the border through terrible circumstances to get to her. It's an erotic, disturbing romance — in other words, career-characteristic work from the director of sibling incest thriller “Daniel and Ana.” As I wrote in my review out of Berlin, this film is “an addictive and destructive love story as sharply wrought as the movie's grander political concerns… There's not a lot of hope in ‘Dreams,' and for that, it's a movie of our times and one that maybe can only exist because of them. It's about how the falsity of the American dream (a dream that is immigrants, after all) propels Mexican people to make the illegal dangerous crossing at all, and about how the U.S. and Mexico need each other in all ways.” I also spoke to Franco and Chastain out of that festival, where Franco said, “I don't need to be liked as a filmmaker, for people to think, ‘Oh, he's a good person.' What's going on between the two countries and what Mexicans and immigrants are living in the States on a daily basis is much more dramatic than even what we portrayed [in ‘Dreams'].

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The entertainment world was rocked on Sunday when comedy great Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found dead at their home in the upscale Los Angeles neighborhood of Brentwood. Nick Reiner was formerly charged with murder on Dec. 16. If convicted, he could face a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, or potentially the death penalty (though Gov. Gavin Newsom currently has a moratorium on executions in the state). The horrific and devastating loss of our parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, is something that no one should ever experience. They continued: “We are grateful for the outpouring of condolences, kindness, and support we have received not only from family and friends but people from all walks of life. As the criminal case gets underway, and more details about the alleged crime emerge, here is everything we know (and don't know) so far about this staggering Hollywood tragedy. At this point, the source said, Romy informed authorities that her brother, Nick, was living in a guest house on the property, but she did not suggest that he might be a suspect or involved in any way. Investigators descended on the Reiner home Sunday night, and there was plenty of chaos and confusion as detectives revealed they were still waiting for a warrant to properly search the house. At the time, too, Los Angeles Police Department Deputy Chief Alan Hamilton said police were “not seeking anyone as a suspect or as a person of interest.” But already, sources were telling Rolling Stone and other outlets that Nick was believed to have been involved in the homicides. While not much is known about Nick's childhood, it is known that he had a complicated relationship with his parents and had long battled drug addiction, including cocaine and heroin. In between rehab stints, he was often homeless. “If I wanted to do it my way and not go to the programs they were suggesting, then I had to be homeless,” Nick told People in 2016, adding: “I was homeless in Maine. Meg Ryan Mourns the ‘Impossible Tragedy' of Rob Reiner's Death in Emotional Tribute Rob and Michele Reiner's Children Break Silence After Brother Nick Charged With Murder of Parents After Nick got clean at 19, his parents spoke about the challenges he faced in rehab and acknowledged their own shortsightedness regarding the efficacy of these programs for their son. “When Nick would tell us that it wasn't working for him, we wouldn't listen,” Rob told The Los Angeles Times in 2015. Michele added, “We were so influenced by these people. Nick went on to co-write a semi-autobiographical film called Being Charlie, which Rob Reiner directed. In the same L.A. Times interview in 2015, Nick admitted he wasn't sure he wanted to make the film, while Rob said, “It was very, very hard going through it the first time, with these painful and difficult highs and lows. And then making the movie dredged it all up again.” On Saturday night, Dec. 13, the Reiners attended a holiday party at Conan O'Brien's house. Though only the couple were invited, sources told Rolling Stone that the Reiners asked if they could bring Nick out of concern for him and to “keep an eye on him.” According to The Hollywood Reporter, the Reiners were reluctant to leave Nick at home unsupervised, and they had been concerned about his recent behavior, which was described as extreme and stressful. Reports on what exactly happened at the party vary somewhat, but all paint a similar, and unnerving, picture. Sources told Rolling Stone that Nick exhibited “antisocial behavior,” such as staring at people. Other outlets, like THR and The Wall Street Journal, claimed that Nick was wandering around the party asking people if they were famous. He reportedly interrupted the comedian Bill Hader while he was speaking with someone else; after Hader told Nick he was having a private conversation, Nick allegedly glared at him for a long time, per The WSJ. Rob and Michele reportedly apologized to O'Brien and left the party, though it's still unclear if Nick left with them. Questions still linger about what exactly happened afterward. 's office would eventually claim that Nick fatally stabbed his parents in the early hours of Dec. 14. A coroner for the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office eventually confirmed the couple died Sunday from “multiple sharp force injuries.” According to several reports, Nick checked into the Pierside Santa Monica hotel at some point on Sunday, though it's not clear when he arrived at the hotel. And by the time police tracked him there, Nick was gone. Nick was taken into custody Sunday night, Dec. 14, hours after his parents' bodies were found. Marshals task force, tracked Nick to Exposition Park, near the University of Southern California, which is about 15 miles from the Reiner's home. It's still unclear how exactly how authorities found Nick, but local ABC affiliate KABC obtained footage that appeared to show Nick at a gas station convenience store before his arrest. Neither prosecutors nor investigators have spoken yet on a possible motive for the alleged crime. Just three months ago, Rob Reiner seemed upbeat about Nick in an interview with NPR. While speaking, reflecting on their film, Being Charlie, Reiner said, “He's been great … hasn't been doing drugs for over six years. Reiner is being held in a downtown Los Angeles jail without bail.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It makes a certain sense that Kerry Washington and Elisabeth Moss would end up in the same series together. They're two titans of 2010s TV who've also both dabbled in limited series since the ends of Scandal and Mad Men. Apparently, they agree; the two both executive produce Imperfect Women, a new eight-episode series coming to Apple TV early next year. They're also bringing Kate Mara (Friendship, American Horror Story) with them. The ensemble cast of the series include names such as Leslie Odom Jr., Joel Kinnaman, Corey Stoll, and Sheryl Lee Ralph.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kylie Kelce reflected on watching brother-in-law Travis Kelce's devastating Kansas City Chiefs game over the weekend — with her daughters and Taylor Swift by her side. During Thursday's episode of her “Not Gonna Lie” podcast, Kylie explained that her and husband Jason Kelce's four daughters had not yet attended a game at Arrowhead Stadium until this past Sunday. “The girls had not yet seen Uncle Trav play in Arrowhead Stadium.” The podcast host, 33, added that their kids — Wyatt, 6, Elliotte, 4, Bennett, 2, and 8-month-old Finnley — had seen Travis play in the Super Bowl, but not at his home stadium. “We actually got to go and see him play at Arrowhead Stadium, which is his home stadium and has been for his entire NFL career, so that was a really cool moment,” she said. “They actually yell at us any time we put football on the TV and only get on board after a little while of realizing that they can really yell,” she shared.

Swift, who had celebrated her 36th birthday the day before, was dressed in a chic Italian wool coat by Ulla Johnson. While Travis won't be getting a shot at his fourth Super Bowl ring this season, Swift got a different ring of her own earlier this year. The “New Heights” co-host, 36, proposed to Swift in August after two years of dating. He got down on one knee in the backyard of his Leawood, Kan., estate and presented her with an old mine brilliant-cut diamond ring designed by jeweler, Kindred Lubeck of Artifex Fine. They are expected to tie the knot this summer in Rhode Island.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kristin Cabot, whose liaison with her boss at a Coldplay concert this summer went viral and cost both of them their jobs, has broken her silence in a New York Times profile, detailing how she's living in the aftermath of public shaming. It's, like, so cliché and so bad.” But as she explained, the fallout was much worse after public shaming led to doxxing, which in turn led to 500 to 600 calls a day and what she estimated as 50 to 60 death threats. I want my kids to know that you can make mistakes, and you can really screw up. She also shared her side of the story, explaining that she started at Astronomer in November 2024 and bonded with Byron over their shared separations from their spouses. I can handle it,” she told the Times. Nevertheless, she said, she went with the moment and pulled Byron's arms around her for a kiss right as the camera hit her. Aware that the camera was on them, when they instantly recoiled, Chris Martin commented, “Either they're having an affair, or they're just very shy.” Cabot told the Times that she and Byron ran to the bar in shame. '” she recalled, adding that their first impulse was to tell Astronomer's board of directors what happened. After the Astronomer's board investigated what happened, they offered Cabot the opportunity to keep her job, but she decided to resign instead, later in July. She tried to disappear by herself for self-healing, but the public shaming was fast and furious, and she began fearing for her and her children's safety when people commented on her daily routines. She told the Times, though, that she wants to own her actions and hopes that people understand and respect her privacy. Byron, Cabot's ex-husband, and reps for Astronomer all declined to comment. And she added that she was especially disappointed in Gwyneth Paltrow, who starred in a cheeky ad for Astronomer, since Paltrow had pioneered the phrase “conscious uncoupling” and had created a company supportive of women.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One day before he turns 80, Criss will release a self-titled rock album, his first in 18 years. It's a proverbial December to remember for KISS' original drummer, Peter Criss. Consider that in a span of two weeks the drummer, singer and songwriter received a Kennedy Center Honor with the band (which will be televised Dec. 23 on CBS), is releasing his first new album in 18 years on Friday (Dec. 19) and, come Saturday (Dec. 20), celebrates his 80th birthday. It's all a “never in my wildest dreams” proposition, Criss says, and proof that the Catman isn't nearly out of lives yet. “I'm not tooting my horn, but I really worked hard for this,” Criss tells Billboard via phone from his home in New Jersey, where he recorded portions of the new Peter Criss album. So I never expected all of this. I thought the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (induction, in 2014) was, ‘Holy mackerel…' This is just a blessing from God.” Criss, who was born George Peter John Criscoula and raised in Brooklyn, actually started work on Peter Criss during 2008, shortly after the release of his fifth solo album, One For All, in the summer of 2007 but shelved the recordings at the time. During the pandemic, however, guitarist and co-writer Mike McLaughlin phoned and said, according to Criss, “‘Cat, you should listen to that album we started. I started listening and, ‘Yeah, this is a really good album. '” That notion was also supported by his friend, current Mötley Crüe guitarist John 5, whom Criss considers “like my son.” “I was in California and played it for Johnny and he said, ‘Peter, this is a great album. So, ‘OK, I guess we're gonna do this. Criss and co-producer Barry Pointer wound up deconstructing the 2008 recordings, keeping the drum tracks Criss had laid down at the time but bringing in McLaughlin and bassist Billy Sheehan to record new parts and adding keyboards by longtime friend Paul Shaffer and backing vocals. The album's package design was done by Matt Montgomery, aka Piggy D. of Marilyn Manson and Rob Zombie's bands, who also plays bass on the track “Cheaper to Keep Her.” “I put my heart and soul into it,” Criss says. It was like having a dream band. You can feel it in the music. I haven't had the experience of doing a record like that since maybe KISS' first album. Peter Criss' tracks range from the balls-out opener “Rock, Rockin' Rock & Roll” and the gleefully adolescent “Hard Rock Knockers” to the theatrical “Creepy Crawlers” and the Sun Records-flavored, truck driver-celebrating “Rubberneckin'.” Elsewhere Criss is more serious, invoking faith and social commentary on songs such as “Murder,” “Justice,” “For the Money” and “Walking on Water.” The latter — “Probably my favorite song on the album,” Criss says — was inspired by his battle with breast cancer and his wife and manager Gigi's own health struggles. Music is so powerful, as you know. You can really pour your heart and soul into something…and I did. Promotion plans for Peter Criss are a somewhat up in the air. ET on Friday he'll sign copies of the album at Rough Trade Below in New York City's Rockefeller Plaza, and Criss is looking at signing events in other cities in the new year. He acknowledges that at his age and after several shoulder surgeries “it's taking a little more time to get around the (drums),” but he doesn't rule out playing live to support the album. “I wouldn't mind getting back on stage, getting the guys together to do a couple shows. I'm in pretty good condition for an old guy; everything is working, maybe a little bit of arthritis here and there, but I still play the drums a few times a week. So, yeah, I hope it does get to that point. In the meantime Criss is still basking in the glow of the Kennedy Center Honors, which took place on Dec. 7 in Washington, D.C., where KISS was feted by magician Cris Angel and performances from Garth Brooks (“Shout It Out Loud”),  Marcus King (Criss' signature song “Beth”) and Cheap Trick (“Rock and Roll All Nite”). It was an honor,” says Criss, who served three tenures with KISS, departing for good — again acrimoniously — in 2004. He appeared amicably with bandmates Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley in D.C. but acknowledges that “we don't keep in touch.” Nevertheless, he adds, “I'm a kid from the streets of Brooklyn. I grew up in a cold-water flat with…seven of us. So coming from a tough neighborhood to standing in the Oval Office with the president was quite a thrill. Only four other bands got this award, and here we are, KISS. That was something.” And despite continuing controversies swirling around Pres. Donald Trump's realignments of the Kennedy Center, Criss says there were no political considerations on his part. I'm proud to be an American, and only in America can four guys like us, from the streets, be in the White House getting such a great award. Making the occasion bittersweet, however, was KISS guitarist Ace Frehley's absence following his death on Oct. 16 at the age of 74, following a fall in his home studio three weeks prior. “That was really hard for me,” says Criss, who spoke to Frehley shortly before his passing. He was like, ‘Wow Cat, I can't believe we're getting this award!' I haven't heard him that excited for a while. He was getting ready to tour again, working on his new album…He was really up.” Criss says Frehley's daughter Monique accepted his medal during the White House presentation, while her mother and Frehley's ex-wife Jeanette was also in attendance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Timothée Chalamet arrived at the New York City premiere for his upcoming “Marty Supreme” with a surprise date–his mother, Nicole Flender. Chalamet, 29, wore a double-breasted suit designed by Haider Ackermann for Tom Ford. He paired the ensemble with a matching orange scarf and watch as well as a Cartier necklace. Flender posed alongside her son, wearing a halter neck gown in “Marty Supreme” orange and carrying a gold purse. Chalamet also wore an all-orange outfit at the Los Angeles premiere of “Marty Supreme,” where he twinned in nearly head-to-toe Chrome Hearts with his girlfriend, Kylie Jenner. The reality television star and cosmetics mogul wore a bright orange gown by the brand. Chalamet opted for an orange Chrome Hearts leather suit and a pair of Timberlands. What would the same be for ‘Marty Supreme'?” he asks. The group agreed on orange because Chalamet's character, Marty Mauser, uses an orange ping-pong ball. “How do we not just cop [sic] the vibe of ‘Barbie'? Hardcore orange,” Chalamet answers his own question before pulling up a PNG of the color that would come to define the “Marty Supreme” press campaign. Chalamet has since been rocking “Marty Supreme” orange at premieres, press conferences and in social media posts. He's also sported a now-coveted windbreaker that fans are scrambling to get their hands on. Chalamet has gifted various versions of the jacket, on which “Marty Supreme” is written above three stars, to fellow celebrities like Frank Ocean, Kid Cudi and even Tom Brady. “Marty Supreme” arrives in theaters on December 25.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kristin Cabot has finally broken her silence after she and her former boss Andy Byron went viral for getting caught canoodling on the kiss cam at a Coldplay concert over the summer. Cabot, 53, debated speaking publicly about the scandal but eventually agreed to do an interview with the New York Times for an article published Thursday. “That's the price I chose to pay,” she said. “I want my kids to know that you can make mistakes, and you can really screw up, but you don't have to be threatened to be killed for them.” Soon after she was hired that November, she and Byron started speaking every day, sometimes three times a day. She quickly developed “big feelings” for him and started fantasizing about the romantic possibilities but knew she couldn't “get too carried away” given their professional dynamic. She told the Times that by the time she invited Byron to the Boston Coldplay concert in July as her plus-one, she had a full-blown “crush.” However, it wasn't a proper date, as they were with a group of her close friends. Cabot admitted that she and Byron each had a couple of tequila cocktails, and as the concert went on, they began to look like a couple. “Whoa, look at these two,” frontman Chris Martin exclaimed into the mic. However, once the duo noticed they were on the big screen, Byron let out a “f–king hell, it's me” and immediately ducked out of view, while Cabot, who acknowledged that “this is awkward,” hid her face in embarrassment. “Either they're having an affair, or they're just very shy,” Martin joked as the audience erupted in laughter, with videos of the moment quickly spreading like wildfire online. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. She said she and Byron immediately drafted up an email to Astronomer's Board of Directors, but by the time they hit “send,” the footage was everywhere. Cabot's family and friends — those who didn't jump ship amid the subsequent public scrutiny and consistent death threats — were devastated. She said her children became “afraid that [she] was going to die and they were going to die.” In early September, Cabot's estranged husband, CEO of Privateer Rum Andrew Cabot, revealed they “were privately and amicably separated several weeks before the Coldplay concert.” Cabot said she and Byron were in touch amid the fallout but eventually agreed that “speaking with each other was going to make it too hard for everyone to move on and heal.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When a monarch butterfly flaps its wings, Apple TV green-lights 16 new shows. While most might never be seen or heard from again [did anyone else know that Megan Thee Stallion and Psy hosted a show called KPOPPED together? ], others are attached to big, expensive IP and therefore deserve your undivided attention. It's all part of the Monsterverse, and today, Apple announced that the universe is expanding enough for Wyatt Russell to star in his own spin-off. The series will be showrun by Emmy-nominated screenwriter Joby Harold. There's no word on when the show will be released or whether Godzilla will make guest appearances, but more monsters are on the way.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Nov. 22-23 festival in Los Angeles incorporated a flurry of clean power initiatives. These projects were done in collaboration with Camp Flog Gnaw producers AEG Presents and Goldenvoice, along with the longstanding sustainability nonprofit REVERB, which consults on sustainability initiatives across the music industry, with a focus on touring and live events. A representative for REVERB tells Billboard that the festival's Gnaw Stage was powered entirely by stadium shore power, which pulled electricity already available from Dodger Stadium's grid power connection and entirely eliminated the use of diesel generators at the stage. The use of shore power also reduced on-site equipment and simplified production logistics. The rep noted that this power method demonstrated that where permanent electrical infrastructure exists, grid power can be a reliable and lower-impact alternative to traditional generator-based stage power.Meanwhile, the festival's main stage was powered by a battery-first diesel hybrid system, with diesel-powered generators on site only as a backup power source. Overall, these initiatives resulted in the avoidance of 76.5 metric tons of CO₂ emissions, a number equivalent to the emissions from 18 gasoline-powered vehicles being driven for a year. These initiatives were similar to those introduced at the 2024 edition of the Portola festival, which is also produced by AEG and Goldenvoice and which, in 2024, avoided using 6,053 gallons of diesel fuel.
