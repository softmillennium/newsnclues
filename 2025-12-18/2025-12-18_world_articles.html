                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“It's not because they don't value their health; it's because they don't feel safe,” said a migrant rights advocate. Truthout's December fundraiser is our most important of the year and will determine the scale of work we will be able to do in 2026. As immigrants in southeastern Louisiana and Mississippi braced for this month's U.S. The friend's Guatemalan tenant, who didn't know she was pregnant, had just delivered a premature baby in the New Orleans house. The parents lacked legal residency, and the mother refused to go to a hospital for fear of being detained by federal immigration officers. “There's blood everywhere, and the baby's dead,” Rosales-Fajardo recalled her friend saying. Rosales-Fajardo put on her sandals, grabbed surgical gloves, and rushed to the house. Rosales-Fajardo, herself an immigrant from Brazil, is a grassroots organizer and advocate in the New Orleans East community, where many immigrants live. I promised her that she was going to be safe,” Rosales-Fajardo said. Still, she made the call and continued performing CPR. Finally, the newborn revived and squirmed in Rosales-Fajardo's arms. “All they do is work to provide for their family. But they were almost at risk of losing their child rather than call 911.” Nearly two weeks into the Department of Homeland Security's Operation Catahoula Crunch, which launched Dec. 3, health professionals and community advocates in Louisiana and Mississippi report that a significantly higher-than-usual number of immigrant patients have skipped health care appointments and experienced heightened stress levels. According to a press release, DHS said it had arrested more than 250 people as of Dec. 11. Since President Donald Trump took office in January, immigrant families nationwide have become more likely to skip or delay health care, due in part to concerns about their legal status, according to a recent survey by KFF and The New York Times. The survey found that nearly 8 in 10 immigrants likely to be living in the U.S. without legal permission say they've experienced negative health impacts this year, from increased anxiety to sleeping problems to worsened health conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes. The federal immigration raids in California, Illinois, North Carolina, and now Louisiana and Mississippi add to the health care barriers that these families already face, including access to services, language barriers, lack of insurance, and high costs. That hesitancy to receive even emergency care appears justified amid the ongoing raids. Hospitals and health facilities generally must allow federal agents in areas where the public is allowed, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. In California this year, federal agents have staked out hospital lobbies, shown up at community clinics, and guarded detainees in hospital rooms. Even driving to and from appointments poses a risk, as traffic stops are a popular place for immigration agents to make arrests. University Medical Center nurse Terry Mogilles said that immigrants typically make up at least half the patients in her orthopedic trauma clinic in New Orleans, many of them with construction-related, bone-crushing injuries that require surgery. “It is so upsetting because we have no idea what's happening to them post-op.” Immigrant families throughout Mississippi are hunkering down in anticipation. Michael Oropeza, the executive director of El Pueblo, a nonprofit serving low-income immigrant communities in Biloxi and Forest, said the organization has witnessed families delay care, cancel children's checkups, and go without refilling medication. Maria, a Biloxi resident from Honduras, said, in Spanish, she and her two children have missed routine doctors' appointments because they are “terrified” to leave the house amid an increased presence of federal immigration officers. Her husband, who is authorized to work in the U.S., was detained for two months this year. They previously qualified for Medicaid, but Maria opted to disenroll them three years ago out of concern that using public benefits would jeopardize her family's residency applications, she said. The family now pays for their children's care out-of-pocket. When it feels safe to attend doctors' appointments again, Maria said, her priority will be seeking mental health care to address the stress her family has endured. “I definitely need to see a doctor to get checked out, because I don't feel well,” she said, describing her anxiety, depression, and insomnia. In Louisiana, Marcela Hernandez of Familias Unidas en Acción, a nonprofit that provides direct aid to immigrants, said many of the families she works with live paycheck to paycheck. Sheltering at home and missing work only adds to the stress. Hernandez said she received 800 calls for food in two days from families afraid to leave home. The longer it goes on, Hernandez said, the more she worries evictions will come next as people can't pay rent, further traumatizing a community whose members often had to make difficult and dangerous journeys to flee hardships in their countries of origin to reach the U.S. Rosales-Fajardo, who runs a nonprofit called El Pueblo NOLA, said families tell her how children have started urinating on themselves due to stress and fear. Nationally, immigrants who are likely to lack legal status report that some of their children have had problems sleeping and that they've seen changes in school performance or behavior, according to the KFF and New York Times survey. Community groups said they hope people step up locally to deliver food and hygiene products to immigrant homes, and that health care professionals provide more at-home or telehealth visits. Like at other hospitals, UMC's waiting rooms are considered public spaces, Mogilles noted. But the nurses union is calling for the hospital to create safe spaces for patients that federal agents can't access and clearer policies to protect health care workers who shield patients. Prenatal and postnatal care is also challenging to provide virtually, leaving the health of new and expecting mothers vulnerable, said Latona Giwa, the executive director of Repro TLC, a national sexual and reproductive health training nonprofit. Since the Chicago immigration sweeps began in September, Giwa said, the clinics and health providers her organization works with have reported that 30% of patients had missed appointments. She said pharmacies saw a 40% drop in medication pickups. “What we know about management of chronic conditions, especially in pregnancy, but in general, is that even missing one appointment can impact the trajectory of that condition and worsen a patient's outcomes,” Giwa said. She's especially concerned about families with preterm babies in the neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU. “Imagine your child is in the hospital, and so vulnerable, and you are terrified to go visit and care for your newborn infant because you're worried about being deported,” Giwa said, noting that a newborn's health partly relies on parental visits.

December is the most critical time of year for Truthout, because our nonprofit news is funded almost entirely by individual donations from readers like you. We are up against a far-reaching, wide-scale attack on press freedom coming from the Trump administration. 2025 was a year of frightening censorship, news industry corporate consolidation, and worsening financial conditions for progressive nonprofits across the board. We can only resist Trump's agenda by cultivating a strong base of support. The right-wing mediasphere is funded comfortably by billionaire owners and venture capitalist philanthropists.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Comments follow reports that US president discussed idea with constitutional scholar Alan Dershowitz The bold assertion came despite successive polls showing plunging approval ratings for Trump amid widespread discontent over his administration's economic performance and lingering controversy over his links to the disgraced late financier and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. “There has never been an Administration that has accomplished as much in less than one year than the Trump Administration,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Axios. “The American people would be lucky to have President Trump in office for even longer.” Her comments came after Dershowitz, a prominent Trump supporter who acted as his defense lawyer after he was impeached by Congress during his first term, told the Wall Street Journal that he had informed the president that the constitution was unclear on whether he could run again. That judgment is at odds with the view of most constitutional experts, who say the 22nd amendment unambiguously bars Trump from seeking a third term. “Do I think he's going to run for a third term? No, I don't think he will run for a third term,” Dershowitz added. Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House of Representatives and one of his key allies on Capitol Hill, has said he “doesn't see a path” for Trump to run again. Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, dismissed the prospect of a third Trump term in an interview with Vanity Fair published this week. She told the magazine that Trump “knows he can't run again” but is “having fun” with the idea because he knows it is “driving people crazy”. Dershowitz told the Journal that, after meeting Trump, he showed a draft copy of his book to Miriam Adelson, the billionaire businesswoman who gave more than $100m to Trump-supporting political action committees during the 2024 presidential race, and who was visiting the White House for a Hanukah party. According to him, she responded: “Is this real? Oh, my God, I hope this can happen.” '” Her comments were met by chants of “four more years” from the assembled crowd, at which point Adelson told Trump: “Think about it.” Trump responded by telling the crowd: “She said, ‘think about it and I'll give you another $250m.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ronald Hicks, who endorsed message condemning ICE raids, to lead one of biggest US archdioceses The US-born pope chose 58-year-old Ronald Hicks, the current bishop of Joliet, Illinois, to lead the church in New York, replacing retiring Cardinal Timothy Dolan who has served for 16 years after being selected by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012. Dolan is regarded as a conservative figure in the US Catholic church hierarchy. Hicks takes on the role of cardinal after Dolan last week finalized a plan to establish a $300m fund to compensate victims of sexual abuse who had brought legal action against the archdiocese. Hicks addressed the issue at news conference on Thursday. In October, Leo questioned whether the policies were in line with the Catholic church's “pro-life” teachings and described them as “inhuman”. Both men served the church abroad: Leo spending 20 years as a missionary in Peru; Hicks spent five years in El Salvador heading a church-run orphanage. Last month, Hicks endorsed a special message from the US Conference of Catholic Bishops condemning the Trump administration's immigration raids. The bishops said they “are disturbed when we see among our people a climate of fear and anxiety around questions of profiling and immigration enforcement. Leo and Hicks only met last year, when the provost and bishop visited one of Hicks's parishes, according to CNN. Hicks told local Chicago WGN-TV after Leo was elected pope that he recognized their shared backgrounds and priorities. In 2005, he moved from Chicago to El Salvador to begin his five-year term as regional director of Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos (NPH) in Central America. NPH is a home dedicated to caring for more than 3,400 orphaned and abandoned children in nine Latin American and Caribbean countries. He returned to Chicago and in 2020 Pope Francis named him Bishop Hicks as the sixth bishop of the Catholic diocese of Joliet, Illinois, serving about 520,000 Catholics in seven counties. “I accept this appointment with humility and an open heart,” Hicks said at the news conference. “I ask for your support and your prayers, and I ask God to support us as always.” Dolan said his successor was “an early Christmas gift for the Archdiocese”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The corruption scandal in Ukraine has, according to Western diplomatic sources, triggered a sharp decline in Ukrainian soldiers' morale on the front lines, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) said in a statement on Thursday. "Ukrainian soldiers' morale at the front lines has plunged as a result of the corruption scandal in Ukraine, according to Western diplomatic sources," the statement reads. "An increasing number of newly mobilized troops are deserting their positions, unwilling to risk death or injury to line the accounts of [Vladimir] Zelensky's team in foreign banks." "The unprecedented surge in desertion cases forced the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine to withdraw previously published statistics on newly opened criminal cases for reported AWOLs," the statement added. On November 10, Ukraine's anti-corruption authorities carried out a large-scale operation to uncover a major corruption scheme in the energy sector. Raids were conducted at the residences of Mindich, Justice Minister German Galushchenko, who was later dismissed, and the premises of the Energoatom company. Later, fragments of recordings of conversations in Mindich's apartment were published, in which corruption schemes were discussed. There are 1,000 hours of tapes in total. On November 17, reports appeared that the then head of Zelensky's office Andrey Yermak might appear on the recordings under the pseudonym Ali Baba. On November 28, his apartment was searched, and on the same day Zelensky fired him.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Farmers in tractors blocked roads and set off fireworks in Brussels on Thursday outside a European Union leaders' summit, prompting police to respond with tear gas and water cannons as protesters rallied against a major free-trade deal with South American nations. Farmers fear an agreement with the trade bloc known as Mercosur will undercut their livelihoods, and there are broader political concerns it is driving support for the far right. “We are fighting to defend our jobs across all European countries against Mercosur,” said Armand Chevron, a 23-year old French farmer. Police in riot gear staffed barriers just outside the European Parliament, which evacuated some staff due to damage caused by protesters. In Brussels, protesters burned tires and a faux wooden coffin bearing the word “Agriculture.” Their fire unleashed a black cloud that swirled with white tear gas. Farmers fear that the deal will undercut their livelihoods, and there are broader political concerns that it could also help drive support for the far right. On Thursday they drove tractors through Brussels and set fire to coffins with the word agriculture printed across them. Canada to resume free-trade talks with South American bloc Mercosur French President Emmanuel Macron dug in against the Mercosur deal as he arrived for Thursday's EU summit, pushing for further concessions and more discussions in January. “Farmers already face an enormous amount of challenges,″ he said, as farmer protests roil regions around France. Worried by a surging far right that rallies support by criticizing the deal, Macron's government has demanded safeguards to monitor and stop large economic disruption in the EU, increased regulations in the Mercosur nations like pesticide restrictions, and more inspections of imports at EU ports. “This doesn't mean that Italy intends to block or oppose (the deal), but that it intends to approve the agreement only when it includes adequate reciprocal guarantees for our agricultural sector,” Meloni said. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is determined to sign the agreement, but she needs the backing of at least two-thirds of EU nations. Italy's opposition would give France enough votes to veto von der Leyen's signature. In Greece, farmers have set up roadblocks along highways across the country for weeks, protesting delays in agricultural subsidy payments as well as high production costs and low product prices that they say are strangling their sector and making it impossible to make ends meet. Supporters say it would offer a clear alternative to Beijing's export-controls and Washington's tariff blitzkrieg, while detractors say it will undermine both environmental regulations and the EU's iconic agricultural sector. “If the European Union wants to remain credible in global trade policy, then decisions must be made now,” Merz said. The deal is also about strategic competition between Western nations and China over Latin America, said Agathe Demarais, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. Von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa are scheduled to sign the deal in Brazil on Saturday. The political tensions that have marked Mercosur in recent years – especially between Argentina's far-right President Javier Milei and Brazil's centre-left Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the bloc's two main partners – have not altered the willingness of South American leaders to seal an alliance with Europe that will result in benefits for their agricultural sector. At a cabinet meeting Wednesday, Lula was clearly irked by Italy and France's positions. He said that Saturday would be a make-or-break moment for the deal. “If we don't do it now, Brazil won't make any more agreements while I'm president,” Lula said, adding that the agreement would “defend multilateralism” as Trump pursues unilateralism. Milei, a close ideological ally of Trump, also supports the deal. “We must stop thinking of Mercosur as a shield that protects us from the world and start thinking of it as a spear that allows us to effectively penetrate global markets,” he said some time ago.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian personnel with links to the country's military and security services have engaged in spying in European waters while working covertly on ships carrying Russian oil, Western and Ukrainian intelligence sources exclusively told CNN. These vessels carry Russia's oil from its Baltic and Black Sea ports despite Western sanctions, earning the Kremlin hundreds of millions of dollars every year. In recent months, some of these ships – often registered to unrelated countries – have acquired extra crew members shortly before leaving port, according to Ukrainian intelligence. Speaking to multiple intelligence sources, CNN has established that several of these men are employed by a secretive Russian company called Moran Security. Some of them are mercenaries, they said, who have previously worked for Russia's private military contractors, such as the notorious Wagner group. Moran personnel have been placed on multiple tankers in Russia's shadow fleet and are frequently the only Russians on board, according to both Ukrainian and Western intelligence sources. The Russians on board are also tasked with keeping an eye on the ships' captains because most of them are not Russian citizens, according to Oleksandr Stakhnevych of the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. They ensure that their contractors act in line with the Kremlin's interests.” Security officials say that putting armed men with military backgrounds on these vessels is yet another tool in the Kremlin's arsenal of hybrid warfare techniques designed to cause disruption in Europe. Intelligence sources also told CNN that these men have engaged in sabotage but did not provide further details. “Having private armed groups onboard shadow fleet vessels is this classic plausible deniability,” Jacob Kaarsbo, a former Danish intelligence official, told CNN. “Everyone with even half a clue knows that these guys take their orders from the Russian state but it's hard to prove,” he added. CNN presented the findings of  Ukrainian and Western intelligence that Moran operates in coordination with Russian intelligence and is involved in espionage and sabotage across Europe to Alexey Badikov, who the US Treasury had listed as the company's CEO. Reached by phone Badikov told CNN he is the deputy director of the Moran Security Group and is based “mostly” in St. Petersburg, but declined to comment on either accusation. CNN pieced together Moran's recent activities on one vessel by reviewing Ukrainian intelligence and obtaining assessments from Western intelligence, as well as analyzing satellite imagery and maritime data. That ship is a sanctioned tanker called the Boracay, which has changed its name and where it is officially registered frequently over the past three years. On September 20, two Russian men boarded the Boracay at the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk near St. Petersburg, according to records obtained by CNN. One of them is a former police officer who previously worked for the Russian private military company Wagner, according to a Western intelligence source. During another voyage made by the Boracay in July, one man on board had served in the special police regiment of Russia's interior ministry, and another held the Russian defense ministry as his registered address, according to Ukrainian foreign intelligence. Many shadow fleet vessels travel through the Baltic Sea, a key maritime chokepoint bordering several NATO states, including Denmark and Sweden, whose authorities pay close attention to the ships. Danish sea pilots, who board the tankers to help them navigate the straits, say there are frequently Russian men on board who seem very much in charge and are hostile toward inspectors. “I have personally seen at least two shadow fleet boats where crew is mostly non-Russians, but suddenly you'll see one or two Russians as part of the list,” said Bjarne Caesar Skinnerup, one of the most experienced officers at Denmark's state pilot service DanPilot. Sometimes, he said, they are wearing uniforms, which on one occasion appeared to be a Russian Navy camouflage uniform. Shipping routes and flight data: CNN investigates drone sightings in Europe In July, DanPilot sent an email to Denmark's Emergency Management authority, saying: “There are more and more reports of ships that have a few extra crew members, probably Russian, who are wearing military uniforms and are very active in photographing, among other things, bridge areas.” Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Sweden's coast guard told CNN it had previously seen men on board shadow fleet ships who did not seem to belong to a merchant vessel. A senior Swedish navy commander, Ewa Skoog Haslum, said last year that some Russian-linked tankers in the Baltic had been carrying “antennas and masts that typically do not belong” to merchant ships. The Boracay made headlines in September as it carried a cargo of Russian oil to India. Two days after leaving Primorsk, on September 22, the ship was off Denmark's coast just as a series of drone sightings disrupted traffic at Copenhagen airport. Ship tracking data shows the Boracay traveled south along Denmark's western coast on the evening of September 24, when other drones were reported flying north of the city of Esbjerg and near several nearby airports. They were questioned in private, according to the sources. Kaarsbo, the former intelligence official, said that while it's not possible to prove whether the men are trained drone pilots, “these guys are not just innocent sailors… there's a decent likelihood that they are capable of launching drones.” “If you would like to use drones, you will use from fishing vessels… not from the big oil tanker,” he added, because “it is technically unsafe and nobody will do it”. One European intelligence official told CNN: “Our working assumption is that Russian ships have been involved in at least some of the unexplained drone events close to European coastlines.” The UK's new foreign intelligence chief, Blaise Metreweli, said this week that “Russia is testing us in the gray zone with tactics that are just below the threshold of war,” such as “drones buzzing airports and bases, aggressive activity in our seas above and below the waves.” Ukrainian intelligence sources shared with CNN the names of eight Russian men who had been on board other ships in the shadow fleet and had sailed a similar route around Europe in the past year. After passing Europe the vessel continued to Vadinar port in western India, where it unloaded a cargo of Russian oil on November 1, according to Kpler, a global data and analytics firm. Moran Security Group was founded in 2009 and had extensive ties with the infamous Wagner private military contractor, as well as Russia's military and intelligence services, according to Western intelligence sources. Two previous Moran directors, Evgeny Sidorov and Vadim Gusev, founded the Slavonic Corps in 2013, the private military company from which Wagner emerged. Wagner Telegram channels have featured Moran personnel at sea, and more than a decade ago the company was involved in counter-piracy off Somalia. The social media profiles of some Moran personnel also show they were linked to Wagner, which was effectively liquidated after its then boss Yevgeny Prigozhin launched an abortive revolt in Russia in 2023. On its website, the Moran group says it seeks “active-duty or retired officers who have served in special forces units (GRU, airborne troops, naval commandos) and who have completed at least two deployments.” The GRU is Russia's military intelligence service. Moran personnel had a role in Syria in support of the now ousted Assad regime, as did Wagner, according to Ukrainian intelligence. Last year's US Treasury designation said the company “offers armed security services and has operated under contract to Russian state-owned enterprises.” One of these organizations is Sovcomflot, Russia's state-owned shipping company, which is listed on Moran's website as a client. As Russia's shadow fleet appears to be expanding in scope and ambition, Europe is facing a delicate dilemma. Danish sea pilot Skinnerup believes there should be tougher joint international action to intercept ships without insurance and proper registration, as is the case with many of the shadow fleet. Because what would be the reaction from Russia?” he asked. “That's why Danish government has not done anything yet, because we are an extremely small country, and if we have to do something, it has to be a joint European thing.” Credits: Reporters: Victoria Butenko, Saskya Vandoorne, Katie Polglase, Pallabi Munsi,Tim Lister and Darya TarasovaSenior Investigative Editor: Ed UprightSupervising Investigative Producer: Barbara ArvanitidisSenior Video Editor: Oscar FeatherstoneManaging Photojournalists: Christian Streib and Alex PlattAssociate Editor, Digital Video: Henry Zeris</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although the Warner acquisition is not yet a done deal, it looks likely to proceed.Daniel Cole/Reuters Shaquille Morgan is a writer, community organizer and policy consultant in social housing. In Canada, content from HBO is exclusively licensed to Bell Media for its streaming platform, Crave. When the deal is finalized, HBO content will be offered to Netflix subscribers, increasing Netflix's market share in the streaming space and making Crave redundant. And it reads: Crave – your days are numbered. Discovery board asks investors to reject Paramount's hostile bid, go with Netflix deal With this purchase, Netflix's already large market share would be significantly over 30 per cent, further outpacing its competitors like Prime, Disney+, and Paramount+. Canada faces an analogous question but with stiffer consequences for Crave, the country's premier domestic streaming company. Today, Netflix is the most subscribed streaming service in Canada, with about nine million subscribers. Crave, on the other hand, has 4.3 million subscribers. While it's unknown how many customers subscribe to both services, many Canadians use Crave specifically to access HBO's catalogue. I say this because for Netflix to optimize the acquired content's value, their best move is to offer it on their own platform. Subsequently, it's likely that Netflix will either pay to void their contract with Bell Media or allow it to expire. The impact on Crave will be mass migration to Netflix as content becomes consolidated and subscribers seek out cost savings. The scale of this exodus could be in the hundreds of thousands, putting Crave in a compromising position and jeopardizing its survival. This is particularly concerning because Bell Media expanded its long-term partnership agreement with WBD in 2024. The deal would then leave Crave with a content gap that can't meaningfully be filled through other partnerships or even Canadian television shows. This might sound dismissive of Canadian content, but what gives Crave its value proposition and market edge is HBO Max's content. That content provides the company with direct access to the Canadian market without WBD having to build its own infrastructure and navigate government regulations. It's a mutually beneficial relationship with Crave arguably gaining the most. In an era where quantity, variety, and actor reputations drive subscribership, this doesn't bode well for Crave. Neither does it bode well for Canadian television and film as HBO was to co-produce original Canadian and Bell Media content to be licensed for use on WBD platforms outside of Canada. In the meantime, Canada has time to prepare for a successful outcome. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following. © Copyright 2025 The Globe and Mail Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Volodymyr Zelensky held talks with European leaders during an EU summit in Brussels on Dec. 18, where a major funding package for Kyiv is at the top of the agenda. Without additional financing, Kyiv will likely run out of cash by spring next year. Belgian Prime Minister Bart de Wever has expressed opposition to the plan, citing legal and financial risks. Ahead of the event, De Wever said he was open to "compromises" but emphasized he cannot accept steps that would jeopardize Belgium's financial security. Speaking at the press conference in Brussels, the Ukrainian president warned that without the next tranche of EU funding by spring, Ukraine's ability to produce drones and conduct long-range strikes on Russian energy infrastructure would be significantly constrained. He called upon EU leaders to adopt a decision by the end of this year and stressed that the status of the reparations loan should not be part of the peace talks, so that Moscow cannot use it to pressure Kyiv. "We don't want this instrument to end up in Russian hands. Earlier, Zelensky said that without the reparations loan, "Ukraine will face serious problems." If Ukraine does not receive the funds, Russian President Vladimir Putin will be emboldened to continue the war and "will not seek diplomacy or dialogue at all," Zelensky said in comments for journalists en route to Brussels. As the summit progressed, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced a "breakthrough" at the EU summit, saying that a "declaration that we all want to use Russian assets for Ukraine was made." Seeking to unlock funds for Ukraine, European leaders have sought to sway Belgium's position, proposing additional guarantees while emphasizing the ramifications of failing to reach a consensus. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Dec. 15 that, if the reparations loan fails, "the European Union's ability to act will be severely damaged for years, if not for much longer." "Now we have a simple choice: either money today, or blood tomorrow," Tusk said ahead of the summit. EU leaders have been discussing two options for long-term financing for Kyiv: the reparations loan and budget borrowing. "We will never leave this Council without a final solution," European Council President Antonio Costa vowed. "Leveraging these assets could enable Ukraine to purchase critical defensive systems, including through the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative, and help Ukraine manage a looming fiscal shortfall," read a letter addressed to Belgium's ambassador in the U.S., Frederic Bernard, and dated Dec. 16. "Providing additional financial support is of paramount importance for the sake of Ukraine, for a Europe that is whole and free, and one day at peace — and for the defense of democracy everywhere," said the paper obtained by the Kyiv Independent. Other EU members, including Italy, Malta, and Bulgaria, joined Belgium in voicing reservations about the reparations loan and called for alternative solutions. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, broadly seen as the most Kremlin-friendly EU leader, has staunchly opposed the plan, calling using Russian assets to fund Ukraine a "declaration of war." In turn, Andrej Babis, Czechia's new prime minister, said he does not oppose using Russian assets to fund Ukraine but ruled out providing guarantees that would burden the national budget. A Russian ballistic missile system known as Oreshnik has been deployed to Belarus and is entering active combat duty, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said during a press conference on Dec. 18. Zelensky was commenting on a potential future election as part of a peace or ceasefire deal that Ukraine has been discussing with the U.S. Ukrainian forces counterattacked near Lyman in Donetsk Oblast, the Third Army Corps said, claiming an entire Russian regiment was destroyed and prisoners were taken. Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) has struck a Russian military airfield in occupied Crimea, reportedly destroying air defense equipment worth hundreds of millions of dollars, the agency said in a Telegram post on Dec. 18. The discussions will concern the 20-point peace plan, security guarantees, reconstruction, and all relevant steps and documents, Zelensky told journalists. Igor Taro, the interior minister of the Baltic nation, said it remains unclear whether the incident was intentional but emphasized that there is no threat to Estonia's security.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President banks on Xi Jinping abandoning Venezuelan dictator over seized ghost ships Within days, the US president announced a full naval blockade designed to sever the Venezuelan president's economic lifeline and compel his loyal inner circle to oust him. It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before,” Mr Trump declared on Tuesday. Insiders see the move as a creative new calculus aimed at starving Mr Maduro's government, whose survival depends on selling crude oil abroad, while simultaneously forcing his allies in Moscow and Beijing to abandon him. Perched in his presidential office in Miraflores Palace, Mr Maduro has relied on the export of Venezuela's vast oil reserves to prop up his country. Beneath him lies more crude oil than Saudi Arabia, Russia or the United States and the mineral, dubbed “liquid gold”, accounts for about 88 per cent of Venezuela's $24bn in exports. In his first term, the US Treasury sanctioned Venezuela's state oil company, PDVSA, and threatened secondary sanctions on any entity doing business with it. Hundreds of ageing tankers now smuggle sanctioned oil, acting as a financial lifeline to Caracas. Financial intelligence firm S&P Global estimates that one in five oil tankers worldwide are used to smuggle oil from sanctioned countries. Despite international pressure, oil exports rose to some 921,000 barrels per day in November, the third-highest monthly average so far this year. “What they're doing is essentially trying to cut off any remaining source of revenue for the government, to try to rattle the government into changing the regime,” said Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House. Indeed, oil tanker seizures are viewed by experts as the final act in Mr Trump's chapter of maximum pressure that began with sanctions years before. Relations between Washington and Caracas are at a nadir. The US and many of its allies consider Mr Maduro, who is currently serving his disputed third term, as a dictator. Yet thanks to the export of Venezuela's oil, Mr Maduro has formed a network of loyal military commanders and international allies who keep his reign afloat. Beijing has taken the oil not as a commercial import but as debt repayment towards an estimated $60bn in loans it has poured into Venezuelan oil projects. Beijing secured oil while Maduro gained time and a friend on the international stage. If Venezuelan oil can no longer be delivered reliably, then Mr Maduro ceases to be an asset to China and becomes a legal liability as it chases repayment. “Once shipments stop arriving at foreign ports, the debts start getting called in. Things are going to start breaking down quickly, physical infrastructure, if these payments don't start to come in,” Mr Martínez-Fernández explained. Beijing has shown little sympathy to similar situations in the past. In Africa and Central Asia, the state has repeatedly distanced itself from leaders it no longer sees as reliable partners. For Mr Trump, the blockade is another step in his plan dubbed the “Donroe Doctrine” by insiders, which aims to rid America's backyard of Chinese influence. Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation doctrine long believed to be a blueprint for his second term, calls it “re-hemisphering”. If the oil-for-debt deal collapses, Beijing may consider switching horses and abandoning him. Also in the crosshairs is Havana, which has long relied on subsidised Venezuelan oil. Cuba, which has been the subject of its own US blockade, has been receiving some 24,000 barrels of crude, gasoline and jet fuel per day from the regime. Mr Sabatini said the blockade will be “catastrophic” for Cuba, a historic enemy of the US, and estimates that exports will drop dramatically. “This is the moment that people like Marco Rubio [the secretary of state] and Cuban-American hardliners living in Florida have been waiting for,” he said. By doing that, then they actually starve the people too.” A Russian-linked “dark fleet” of tankers have also helped Mr Maduro avoid sanctions by shipping his oil around the globe. However, Putin, who has sought to curry favour with Mr Trump since his return to the Oval Office, may redirect the vessels, further isolating Mr Maduro. Indeed, signs of Moscow's shift in position are already there. Experts agree that Mr Trump is attempting to squeeze Mr Maduro economically while testing the resolve of his few remaining allies in the hope they turn against him. For months, American forces have launched lethal strikes on small vessels skimming through international waters under the banner of anti-drug operations. US navy and coastguard units have destroyed around 20 boats since early September, killing over 90 people. Eight warships, including three destroyers, three amphibious assault ships, a cruiser and a smaller littoral combat ship now make up the largest US military presence in the region in decades. B-2 bombers have also been spotted flying off the coast. Instead, they hope to turn the very cartels that military officials say are complicit in the smuggling of fentanyl to the US, against their leader by choking their cash flow, which is used to finance them. Generals control ports, customs and fuel distribution, making the military a pillar of Mr Maduro's power. The same logic applies to Mr Maduro's alleged relationship with organised crime. “It doesn't take us yet to the place where we're going into Venezuelan territory and conducting military strikes. We're still talking about operations in international waters,” Mr Martínez-Fernández said. Top military officials are said to have presented the US president with options for military intervention in the region which include land strikes. Other options reported to have been drawn up by the Pentagon include direct attacks on Mr Maduro's security detail or operations to seize the country's oil fields. In each, Mr Trump is said to be against ideas that may place American troops at risk or could turn into an embarrassing failure. Mr Trump and his cabinet have begun framing the blockade as a necessary intervention to reclaim “American oil”. Perhaps his thirst for the Nobel Peace Prize and the potential blowback amongst his America First base if he started a war. What happens next will be determined by Mr Trump's blockade. But if it is stopped, China may decide the debt is not worth collecting and his cash-poor lieutenants may turn against him.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EU leaders are meeting in Brussels on Thursday amid sharp divisions over a proposal to use frozen Russian state assets to finance Ukraine's military – a plan Moscow has denounced as outright theft and warned would trigger legal retaliation. EU members have long debated tapping Russian central bank funds estimated at around €210 billion ($246 billion) as part of a so-called “reparations loan” to Kiev (to understand why that is a misnomer and part of EU spin, read here) which it will have to repay only if Russia agrees to pay war damages. The official agenda also does not explicitly mention Russian assets, saying only that EU leaders “will discuss the latest developments in Ukraine and issues that require urgent EU action.” EU sanctions normally require unanimous approval, giving any single member state a veto. Moscow has warned that any attempts to seize its assets will constitute “theft” and violate international law, adding that the move would trigger retaliatory measures and legal action. Tusk offered no clarity on whether EU leaders had agreed on a way forward, saying only that Europe faced a “simple choice” between financial support now or “blood” down the line - a decision he said European leaders must confront themselves. PM Tusk:Now we have a simple choice. “We are an area of the world which praises itself for respecting the rule of law,” Lagarde told a press conference in Frankfurt, as quoted by Politico. “It's not for the central bank to actually encourage [or]support a mechanism under which we would be called upon – and scheduled – to breach Article 123 of the Treaty,” she said, arguing the rule bans “monetary financing” – effectively central-bank funding of government spending – which such a Ukraine loan could amount to. The EU Council has decided to link Ukraine to the European Defense Fund, Ukrainian Defense Minister Denis Shmigal has claimed. The European Defense Fund is the Commission's central defense initiative, though its results have largely been measured in strategy papers rather than deployable capabilities. 🇺🇦🇪🇺 Today's decision of the EU Council to incentivise defence investments and associate Ukraine with the European Defence Fund is a strategic investment in Europe's long-term security.Ukraine's defence industry is already an integral pillar of Europe's security architecture.… Thousands of farmers from across Europe marched through Brussels today to protest European agricultural policy as the summit was taking place. Belgian PM De Wever has had a face-to-face with Vladimir Zelensky. • The Russian central bank has significantly escalated the stakes by warned that it would seek damages from “European banks” and not only from Euroclear. • Reports are emerging of a German concession to share risk that could address Belgium's concerns. • The meeting attendees are now facing “many hours of increasingly technical discussions,” according to Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. The discussion of financing Ukraine has reportedly started, according to Euractiv. The confiscation or use of other states' sovereign assets undermines trust in the international financial system, former Ukrainian PM Nikolay Azarov has told RT. By doing that, they basically distract attention from internal crises in their countries, Azarov claimed. The Mercosur deal and securing finance for Kiev are seen as two tests of the EU's fitness for purpose and its international standing. “It's like Europe has become a dictatorship,” he said, accusing European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen of seeking to “force the deal through.” The Brussels summit got off to a rocky start for Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, one of the critics of using Russian assets to aid Ukraine. Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever has signaled that he is open to compromises, but “on a number of points which threaten the financial security of Europe and Belgium, it is not possible.” Belgian PM Bart De Wever has skipped the arrivals at the EU's Brussels building, Euronews has reported, disappointing the vast majority of the EU press pool who have been primed to put some tough questions to him over his refusal to back asset theft. Twelve EU members are currently in favor of the “reparations loan” scheme, while seven oppose it or want alternatives, and eight remain on the fence, Gaidar Institute researcher Kirill Chernovol has told TASS. He added EU rules require support from at least 15 states, meaning the plan would pass if three of the undecided countries vote in favor. Though France is notoriously cagey about revealing exactly which banks hold Russian assets, the European Parliament published a report in September detailing what its research had found. France, which even pro-EU correspondents have suspected of flip-flopping on asset theft, is thought to hold some €19 billion of Russian sovereign funds. He also warned that not only Hungary, but several other EU members could push back against decisions requiring unaniminty. Ukraine will exhaust its funding within several months if the EU fails to agree on tapping Russian assets, Leo Litra, a visiting fellow with the European Security Programme, has told the Daily Telegraph. “If this happens – and if Ukraine does not have a plan B – it means a defeat in the war,” he added. The EU plan to finance Ukraine's war effort with immobilized Russian sovereign assets has backfired, intensifying divisions inside the bloc, Politico reported on Wednesday, citing public comments and people familiar with the matter. Despite weeks of negotiations, efforts to win over Belgium have faltered, the report added. Belgium strongly opposes using the assets and has since drawn support from other member states. Moscow has consistently warned of strong retaliatory actions if the EU goes ahead with its plan to steal sovereign Russian assets. As an opening salvo, the Russian central bank last week filed a $230 billion lawsuit against Euroclear at a Moscow court. A judgement against Euroclear carries risks of major reputational damage, which the Belgium-based depository has warned could potentially lead to its bankruptcy if other countries withdraw funds.</p>

So Mr. Umerov has some significant problems ahead of him," he pointed out. Umerov's name surfaced in connection with the case of businessman Timur Mindich. Mindich reportedly talked Umerov into purchasing $5.2 million worth of low-quality bullet-proof vests for the Ukrainian army. On November 25, Umerov was questioned by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) on this case as a witness. On December 15, the EU added Dougan to its Russia-related sanctions list, accusing him of "participating in pro-Kremlin digital information operations."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kyiv has signed several new defense agreements with Berlin totaling 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion), Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on Dec. 17, a day after the Ramstein-format meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG). Under the new agreements, Germany will provide Ukraine with a "long-term" supply of spare parts for Patriot air defense systems currently in use in Ukraine. "This will enable faster repair, modernization, and restoration of existing systems," Ukraine's Defense Ministry highlighted in a news release. Amid an increase in the frequency and severity of Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities, Kyiv has long called on Western allies to support its air defense capabilities. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius confirmed on Dec. 17 that Berlin has delivered two previously pledged Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine earlier this year, as well as its ninth IRIS-T battery. In addition to the commitments to Ukraine's air defense, Berlin will also assist in the procurement of Ukrainian-made drones, in a deal worth €200 million ($234 million) as well as the production of 200 Bohdana self-propelled howitzer systems mounted on top of the German-made Mercedes-Benz Zetros chassis. The deal also includes the delivery off advanced electronic warfare systems as well as the co-production of reconnaissance drones between Quantum Systems, a Germany-based tech company, and Ukrainian firm Frontline Robotics — in a first of its kind foreign-based production of drones for Ukraine's military. In addition to the new agreements, Pistorius announced earlier in the day that Germany would "transfer a significant number of AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles" to Ukraine next year. The Sidewinder is an air-to-air missile that can be used by helicopters and fighter jets; however, Ukraine has also been repurposing these munitions for use on ground-based platforms. European allies have continued to increase aid funding to Ukraine amid a halt in the deliveries of financial aid from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Without extra financing, Kyiv will run out of cash by spring next year. Dmytro Basmat is a senior news editor for The Kyiv Independent. A Russian ballistic missile system known as Oreshnik has been deployed to Belarus and is entering active combat duty, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said during a press conference on Dec. 18. Zelensky was commenting on a potential future election as part of a peace or ceasefire deal that Ukraine has been discussing with the U.S. Ukrainian forces counterattacked near Lyman in Donetsk Oblast, the Third Army Corps said, claiming an entire Russian regiment was destroyed and prisoners were taken. Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) has struck a Russian military airfield in occupied Crimea, reportedly destroying air defense equipment worth hundreds of millions of dollars, the agency said in a Telegram post on Dec. 18. Ukrainian drones reportedly struck an oil tanker in the Port of Rostov overnight on Dec. 18, local officials in Russia's Rostov Oblast reported.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro said Wednesday that his US counterpart Donald Trump had revealed his true motives toward the South American country with his claim that that it had stolen US “oil, land and other assets.” Maduro said Trump's claim showed the US was really seeking regime change along with ownership of Venezuela's territory and resources. Previously, the US has characterized its build-up of naval forces near the country as being aimed at combating drug-trafficking. The truth has been revealed,” Maduro said during a speech in Caracas Wednesday. “The aim in Venezuela is a regime change to impose a puppet government that wouldn't last 47 hours, that would hand over the Constitution, sovereignty, and all the wealth, turning Venezuela into a colony. Trump's blockade could lead to regime change in Venezuela - analyst says Trump told reporters on Wednesday that Venezuela had illegally taken away “energy rights” and that the US wanted them back. They took it away because we had a president that maybe wasn't watching. As you know, they threw our companies out and we want it back.” Venezuela brought its oil sector under state control in the 1970s. Trump has repeatedly warned that the US could carry out strikes in Venezuela soon, and said that any country trafficking drugs into the United States is “subject to attack,” suggesting that neighboring Colombia could be one of them. In his speech on Wednesday, Maduro called on Colombia to unite with Venezuela and defend both nations' sovereignty. I call upon them for a perfect union with Venezuela so that no one dares touch the sovereignty of our countries,” Maduro said. Maduro also condemned Trump's comments in a phone call with UN Secretary-General António Guterres on Wednesday, Venezuela's government said. “President Maduro stressed that such statements must be categorically rejected by the United Nations system, as they constitute a direct threat to sovereignty, international law, and peace,” the Venezuelan government said in a statement. Earlier, UN spokesperson Farhan Haq told reporters that Guterres was focused on avoiding any further escalation between the US and Venezuela. “Of course, as always, he believes that any difference must be resolved by peaceful means,” Haq said. The exchanges came just a day after Trump said he would impose a blockade on all sanctioned oil tankers transiting Venezuela. Asked if a blockade would violate international law, Haq replied: “I think we are looking at what the applicable laws are at this stage and we're studying the situation but certainly parties have to abide by the UN Charter and you can read the charter for yourself and see what that entails.” CNN's Stefano Pozzebon and Hira Humayun contributed to this report.</p>
