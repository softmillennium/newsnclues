                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Simultaneously, insiders such as David Grusch who are aware of the alleged facts and are currently advocating for disclosure have stated that any public disclosure that does occur would need to be managed extremely carefully. Humans are massively underestimating the dominant interstellar NHI civilisations' power and technological capabilities. Therefore, humans don't currently have control over our planet's airspace and would potentially be unable to protect Earth. Humans are much less "special" in the grand scheme of things than we think. Humans may even be the equivalent of wildlife animals inside a zoo or enclosure. Humans may be permanently quarantined inside our solar system because our characteristics as intelligent, inquisitive, expansionist and (most of all) extremely violent armed primates cause us to pose a danger to the stability of NHI territory if we ever figure out how to get there. If all of these claims are true, then many people will react very badly to finding out that mankind is completely outclassed, outnumbered, outgunned, utterly alone, and permanently confined to a "quarantined enclosure" that our species will never be allowed to leave. It would certainly change one's perspective when looking up at the night sky. It's our vulnerability, our lack of autonomy, and any related actions the NHIs may be taking that target humans individually and Earth geopolitically, especially NHI activities that would be interpreted as malicious. A feasible speculative explanation is that it may involve Point 8 in the list above. Perhaps technological breakthroughs enabling human interstellar travel are about to happen much sooner than we think, specifically because the capabilities of AI and Quantum Computing are accelerating much faster than expected.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At least that is what UFO whistleblower David Grusch claimed in a recent interview. He has been very vocal, along with several other former United States government officials, about the existence of aliens. These program, he claims, conducted unsanctioned technological research related to UFOs. Grusch says he shared this information with the FBI, CIA, Department of Homeland Security, tech entrepreneurs, and financial leaders during a secret meeting in New York City. More recently, in an interview with Fox News, Grusch claims President Donald that Trump has received reports on crashed spacecraft and non-human remains. He also claims Trump received a briefing on the existence of numerous alien races. One of those alien races has supposedly been crossbreeding with humans to make an alien-human hybrid. Certainly, the current president is very knowledgeable on this subject,” David Grusch said. Missouri congressman Eric Burlison has backed many of David Grusch's claims about UFOs and aliens. The congressman explained in an interview earlier this year that “Nordic aliens are like a few hundred years more advanced than we are, but they're not super advanced.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Written by frequent Spielberg collaborator David Koepp (Jurassic Park) and based on an original story from the maestro himself, Disclosure Day explores the profound implications of alien discovery. In a chilling moment from the teaser, Elizabeth Marvel's character poses the haunting query: “Why would he make such a vast universe yet save it only for us?” Cast members can't stop raving about the script's emotional depth. Josh O'Connor, fresh off his acclaimed roles, described it as “like old-school Spielberg,” adding, “I think people will be excited.” I thought it was one of the most beautiful scripts about our humanity. Screenwriter David Koepp echoed that sentiment, calling the project “a very emotional experience.” After exploring war, adventure, and autobiography in recent years, Spielberg is revisiting the awe-inspiring world of aliens that captivated audiences in classics like War of the Worlds and E.T. Yet, with its timely exploration of disclosure and humanity's place in the cosmos, Spielberg's latest feels uniquely positioned to stand out — not just as entertainment, but as a cinematic event that might spark real conversations about the stars above us. Get your tissues ready — this one might just make you believe again. Are you hyped for Steven Spielberg's emotional UFO return in Disclosure Day?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of 274 moons orbiting Saturn, Titan has long fascinated scientists due to its unique surface features. For example, Titan is the only solar system body besides Earth that may potentially have liquids on its surface, in the form of methane and ethane. When combined with its icy surface temperature of –290 degrees Fahrenheit (–179°C), it is considered unlikely that life could exist in any of those liquid environments. When NASA scientists first analyzed data from Cassini's decade-plus mission to Saturn and its moons, the initial readings suggested that a large, liquid-water ocean may exist beneath Titan. The discovery fueled speculation about possible extraterrestrial life forms living in such an ocean, including whether more complex life could exist under such conditions. More recently, evidence has mounted that several other solar system moons, including Saturn's “Death Star” moon Mimas and Jupiter's Ganymede and Europa, may also have massive seawater oceans underneath their icy shells. Those discoveries have once again increased optimism that future missions to those space bodies could discover the first irrefutable evidence of life beyond Earth. “A deep ocean would permit the crust to flex more under Saturn's gravitational pull, but if Titan were entirely frozen, it wouldn't deform as much,” Journaux said. The NASA-led team said that adding this variable was critical, since a closer analysis of the Cassini data showed that Titan's most considerable deformation occurs roughly 15 hours after Saturn's peak gravitational pull. This increased energy dissipation allowed them to make more informed inferences about the moon's interior structure. Specifically, the long deformation delay indicated the interior structure was much thicker and viscous than simple water, since more energy was needed to cause a change in Titan's shape. “Nobody was expecting very strong energy dissipation inside Titan,” said the study's leader, Flavio Petricca, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Journaux said the results suggest Titan's icy surface has a thick, slushy layer beneath that requires more energy to deform than water does. Paralyzed Man Controls Robotic Arm With His Thoughts in Brain-Computer Interface Breakthrough “Instead of an open ocean like we have here on Earth, we're probably looking at something more like Arctic sea ice or aquifers,” the researcher explained. When discussing the new analysis, Journaux said that a slushier Titan interior could have “implications for what type of life we might find.” For instance, a thicker or more viscous environment might lead to nutrients gathering in small areas of water rather than being dispersed throughout an entire global ocean. The new model also suggested that these theoretical pockets of nutrient-dense water could reach 68 degrees Fahrenheit in highly localized, transient briny areas under specific conditions, influenced by Saturn's gravity. “It expands the range of environments we might consider habitable.” The team said their updated models suggest that future missions to Titan, such as NASA's Dragonfly Mission, which includes Journaux as part of the team, may not discover “fish wriggling through slushy channels.” Instead, if a future mission does find signs of life on Saturn's enigmatic moon, it may resemble the simpler life forms found on Earth's polar ecosystems. The study “Titan's strong tidal dissipation precludes a subsurface ocean” was published in Nature.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Astronomers traced a mysterious 'scar' of ionized gas around the solar system to two stars that had a close flyby with our sun millions of years ago. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Roughly 4.5 million years ago, the sun passed remarkably close to two intensely bright stars whose radiation flooded nearby space — and the encounter left a ghostly scar that astronomers can still detect today, according to a new study. The research team says the close pass helps to solve a decades-old mystery of why the space around our solar system is far more energized than models predict, including why it contains a surplus of ionized helium. Using computer models to rewind the paths of stars near the sun, a team led by University of Colorado Boulder astrophysicist Michael Shull found that two blue-white stars, Beta Canis Majoris and Epsilon Canis Majoris, passed within 30 light-years of the sun about 4.5 million years ago. Their passage also may have overlapped with the time when Lucy — a remarkably complete fossil of an early human ancestor discovered in Ethiopia in 1974 — walked the Earth. "They weren't headed straight toward us...but that's close," Shull told Live Science. Today, the solar system drifts through a diffuse patchwork of more than a dozen nearby wisps of gas and dust called the local interstellar medium, made primarily of hydrogen and helium and extending roughly 30 light-years from the sun. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Astronomers think these clouds were sculpted over several million years by shock waves from exploding stars in the Scorpius-Ophiuchus region, a rich cluster of massive stars about 300 light-years from Earth, which compressed interstellar gas into the thin local clouds seen today. Observations dating back to the 1990s, including from NASA's now-retired Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer space telescope, revealed that this region is unusually ionized. Helium atoms, in particular, have been stripped of their electrons at nearly twice the rate expected relative to hydrogen. That imbalance has puzzled astronomers, because helium requires more energetic radiation to ionize than hydrogen does. This makes its elevated ionization difficult to explain with the sun's radiation alone, which does not extend that far beyond the solar system. Over time, the gas would have slowly returned to a more neutral state through a process called recombination, in which free electrons reattach to ions and become atoms. "It's like a dance floor," Shull told Live Science. Astronomers had previously identified other sources of ionizing radiation, including three nearby white dwarf stars — G191-B2B, Feige 24 and HZ 43A — compact stellar remnants that are known to emit strong ultraviolet light. Although astronomers have had reliable stellar motion data for decades, Shull said the problem became solvable only recently. Advances in ultraviolet and X-ray observations made possible by suborbital rocket flights, along with improved models of stellar evolution and atmospheres — and the computing power needed to run them — finally allowed researchers to connect the dots. —'A scale almost too big to imagine': Scientists spot monster black hole roaring with winds at more than 130 million mph —Mysterious X-ray signal from deep space may be the scream of a star ripped apart by two black holes The findings also may have implications closer to home. The sun, however, is not expected to remain inside these clouds indefinitely. "Then, we're going to be in for a big dose of radiation," Shull said. Looking ahead, Shull said that understanding how atoms in the wispy local clouds shifted between more charged and more neutral states as radiation waxed and waned while the two stars approached, passed by and moved away from our solar system remains part of a larger puzzle researchers are still assembling.

The X “for you” page, which serves up content determined by an algorithm, was filled with false details, including: that the attack that left 15 people dead was a psyop or false-flag operation; that those behind the attack were IDF soldiers; that those injured were crisis actors; that an innocent person was one of the alleged attackers; and that the Syrian Muslim hero who fought the attackers was a Christian with an English name. An altered clip of the New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, with deepfaked audio making false claims about the attackers, was shared across multiple accounts. In another particularly egregious example, an AI-generated image based on an actual photo of the victims was altered to suggest he was a crisis actor having red makeup applied to his face to look like blood. “I saw these images as I was being prepped to go into surgery today and will not dignify this sick campaign of lies and hate with a response,” the man depicted in the fake image, human rights lawyer Arsen Ostrovsky, later posted on X. Tarar said the Pakistani man was “a victim of a malicious and organised campaign” and alleged the disinformation campaign originated in India. This claim seems to have originated on a website that was set up on the same day as the terror attack to mimic a legitimate news site. AI-generated images of Ahmed also proliferated on social media, promoting crypto schemes and fake fundraisers. Misinformation was floating around back then too, but it was less common and it wasn't served up via an algorithm designed to reward engagement based on outrage (particularly for verified accounts that stand to financially benefit from that engagement). When Musk took over X, he dismantled the site's factchecking scheme in favour of a user rating system called “community notes”, which appends crowdsourced user factchecking to posts. But, as the QUT lecturer Timothy Graham said this week, the community notes system isn't helpful in situations where opinions are deeply divided. Community notes have since been applied to many of the above examples, but it happened long after most people would have seen the original posts in their feeds. The company did not respond to questions about what it is doing to tackle misinformation posted on its platform, or propagated by its AI chatbot. A saving grace is that many of the fakes are still easily spotted – for now. The crisis actor post had many of the hallmarks of dodgy AI image generation, such as incorrectly generated text on a T-shirt. But as AI models improve that could change, making it even harder to distinguish fact from fiction. Digi, the industry group representing the social media platforms in Australia, proposed dropping a requirement to tackle misinformation from an industry code earlier this year, saying “recent experience” demonstrated “misinformation is a politically charged and contentious issue within the Australian community”. It's hard to see how this week will change things. Josh Taylor is a technology reporter for Guardian Australia</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jacques Raubenheimer does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment. In the wake of Sunday's tragic Bondi shooting, conspiracy theories and deliberate misinformation have spread on social media. In a surprising lateral jump, this is taken to show Akram must be an Israeli agent. Similar stories did the rounds when US right-wing activist Charlie Kirk was killed in September, and after an attack on US National Guard members in November. I have studied the mechanics of Google Trends extensively in my research, and I can confirm this is true – and the “noise” can lead to strange results, especially when looking at searches for unusual terms or coming from small areas. Google Trends shows information about what users are searching for at different places and times. The data it uses are what statisticians call a “time series”, but they are unusual in a couple of ways. First, you can very easily select different time scales, such as minute-by-minute and year-by-year. Time series normally contain all available data (such as these statistics on annual hospitalisations). The Google Trends help page explains this as follows: While only a sample of Google searches are used in Google Trends, this is sufficient because we handle billions of searches per day. However, my research has shown that queries related to terms that are not widely searched (such as “Naveed Akram” before the shooting) or in small geographical regions (where there are fewer people doing searches) can display a wide variation of results from one sample to the next. The high variation causes a very distinct pattern of zero or near-zero values with some isolated big spikes, which is very evident in the post below. These spikes are often caused by “statistical noise” in the data – small random fluctuations that are smoothed out when we look at a larger number of events. Another misconception about the data is related to time. This is, in fact, exactly what to expect with Google Trends data. For short-term data (such as that typically used in these social media posts), Google continually updates results in real time. For longer-term data, Google only adds one new sample per day (though we have developed methods to get around this). A third misconception is that the numbers shown on Google Trends charts are the number of searches for a given term. So if the maximum number of searches was ten, it would show up as 100 – and if there were three searches at another time, this would show up as 30 (although Google does suppress very low-volume searches). So a post about search trends for the alleged killer of Charlie Kirk claiming there are “Less than 1 in 1 BILLION odds of it happening” is incorrect. It is, in fact, highly probable: if “Tyler James Robinson” (Charlie Kirk's alleged killer) had 30 searches, and “Lance Twiggs” (Robinson's partner) had 40, one would see exactly this pattern (if 40 is scaled to 100; 30 is accordingly scaled to 75). Even without understanding all this information about Google Trends data, some common sense can also help. That there might have been a few searches for “Naveed Akram” even before December 14 is therefore not surprising. Google Trends data can be incredibly useful for understanding events in real time. For example, it has been used to predict — with a margin of error — the outcomes of elections and referendums. However, to do so properly, and not perpetuate fiction, one has to understand the data and interpret the results properly.</p>
