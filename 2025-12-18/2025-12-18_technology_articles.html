                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a remarkable pivot, Athira Pharma is shifting its primary focus from Alzheimer's to oncology following a multi-year period marked by clinical failures and leadership turnover. The Bothell, Wash.-based company announced today that it has licensed a Phase 3 breast cancer drug from Sermonix Pharmaceuticals, supported by $90 million in funding from a group of healthcare investment firms. It could land an additional $146 million if the research yields promising results. Athira will simultaneously continue researching ATH-1105, its own drug candidate for treating ALS. “By securing rights to this late-stage program — while also advancing pATH-1105 for ALS — we are building a pipeline that we believe has the potential to change lives and create enduring value,” Litton said on LinkedIn. Under today's deal, Athira secures an exclusive license to develop and commercialize the breast cancer therapy for nations outside of Asia and select Middle Eastern countries. The drug, called lasofoxifene, is currently in a clinical trial that has enrolled over half of its target patient population, with initial results expected in mid-2027. The agreement provides Sermonix with 5.5 million shares of Athira's stock. Three lead investors are backing the research: New York's Commodore Capital, biotech hedge fund Perceptive Advisors, and California-based TCGX. Athira raised $90 million by selling stock and warrants to investors, extending its cash runway into 2028. Tech Moves: Fortive SVP joins Microsoft; Pictory hires CMO; Starbucks exec retires</p>

The DDR5 memory pricing crisis has sent the whole PC market into utter chaos, including pricing on AMD's flagship AM4 gaming chip. eBay prices for the Ryzen 7 5800X3D have skyrocketed to the point where these chips are being sold regularly for more money than a brand-new Ryzen 7 9800X3D. Second-hand prices for the 5800X3D average around $500-$600 on eBay. Some of the highest-selling units sold at nearly $800, showing how desperate some buyers are to buy AMD's best gaming chip that still uses DDR4 memory. Even AMD's slightly lower-end Ryzen 7 5700X3D is going for $300-$450 on eBay. However, its most recent price hikes of $500 upwards are new, likely due to the new DRAM pricing crisis forcing buyers back to AM4. AMD opted to discontinue DDR4 support completely when creating AM5. Intel is also in a similar boat, having locked itself to DDR5 support exclusively for its latest Core Ultra 200S series chips. Performance was a generation ahead of other Zen 3 parts, enabling it to outperform Intel's $700+ Core i9-12900KS flagship at the time in gaming performance. Once Zen 4 arrived, the 5800X3D continued to provide value, proving to be an excellent mid-range alternative and outperforming some of AMD's lower-end Ryzen 7000 parts in gaming performance while running on the cheaper AM4 platform with cheaper DDR4 memory. Buying a 5800X3D for $500 may seem ludicrous, but the aforementioned AM4 support is why the chip is being purchased at these elevated prices. Where AM4 is excelling right now is in motherboard and memory combos; at Newegg, you can still find AM4 motherboard + DDR4 memory combos for $150 or less. However, even DDR4 RAM hasn't been immune to price hikes, meaning you still need to shop around for a bargain, unless you already own some, of course. If you are looking to buy used Ryzen 7 X3D models right now, it's worth checking out the 5700X3D, which is selling at significantly lower prices overall compared to the 5800X3D on eBay.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Chinese-language artificial intelligence app Haotian is so effective that it's made millions of dollars selling its face-swapping technology on Telegram. The service integrates easily with messaging platforms like WhatsApp and WeChat and claims that users can tweak up to 50 settings—including the ability to adjust things like cheekbone size and eye position—to help mimic the face they are impersonating. Scammers have used Haotian and other deepfake tools to more easily substantiate their deceptions by allowing victims to “videochat” with the character they believe they have been talking to as part of an investment opportunity, friendship, or even romantic relationship. Analysis by the cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic of four cryptocurrency wallets linked to Haotian shows the company has received at least $3.9 million in payments in recent years, including money from cryptocurrency wallets linked to alleged criminal activity, including fraud. Additionally, almost half of its payments had ties to a scam marketplace sanctioned by the US government, Elliptic says. Hieu Minh Ngo, a reformed criminal hacker turned cybercrime investigator at the Vietnamese scam-fighting nonprofit ChongLuaDao, says that Haotian, which emerged around 2021, was “one of the first of its kind and very popular.” Ngo has conducted extensive research into Haotian and its operations. Haotian is just one part of the wider tech ecosystem that has emerged around Southeast Asia's booming cybercrime industry and forced labor scam compounds. In the last two years, officials working for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime have identified more than 10 face-swapping tools potentially being used by cybercriminals in Southeast Asia, including for cryptocurrency scams and police officer impersonation. Haotian has a website for its face-swapping tool, but it primarily promotes its desktop app via a public Telegram channel, which launched in October 2023 according to Ngo's research. Through this channel, which now has more than 20,000 subscribers, the company markets new versions of the app, gives development updates, and offers technical support. While marketing software through Telegram isn't inherently nefarious, researchers say that Haotian's customer base has increasingly skewed toward scammers who already seek out information about an array of gray market services on the messaging app. However, after WIRED got in touch with the company, the main public Haotian Telegram channel and some associated accounts became inaccessible or appeared to have been deleted. Telegram did not return a request for comment on whether the company took these accounts down. Haotian is a Cambodia-based company that says it is headquartered in Phnom Penh and advertises on-site installation services and support in the region. One post on Telegram says the technology can help to create an “elite, authentic persona” that the “client completely believes.” (Scammers often refer to people that are being scammed as customers or clients). Another message highlighted by researchers said: “The chat lacks authenticity? After all, how could such a beautiful girl lie?” Research published in March by the security firm Tehtris tracked various domain names that appear to have been linked to Haotian in recent years, including the current site “haotian.ai,” and past addresses “haotianai.com” and “haotianai.us.” Meanwhile, Ngo's research found that Haotian's website has openly referred to social engineering techniques. On both Telegram and its own website, Haotian's discussion of social engineering frequently uses the phrase “精聊” or “jingliao” that literally means “deep chat” or “spiritual chat.” In practice, though, the phrase refers to social engineering and particularly connotes “pig butchering” scams. “Our target customers are entertainment streamers or live salers,” the Haotian account said in Chinese. “We only provide face-swapping software for live streaming and do not allow our products to be used for illegal activities.” In some of its materials, the company notes, according to translations by WIRED, that it places limitations on creating deepfake pornography. The account speculated that if such marketing exists, it is “most likely” from accounts impersonating Haotian. When asked about language on haotian.ai that appears to market to scammers, the Haotian Telegram account said that the company does not have a website. There are a few ways to use Haotian's desktop software. Examples in promotional videos include Elon Musk and Leonardo DiCaprio, but users could also provide materials so the system can generate their own face or someone else's. Regardless, users can tweak their face-swapped appearance using granular tools to hone various facial attributes. The video output, according to researchers and the company's promotional videos, can be streamed to video calls on WhatsApp, Line, Telegram, Facebook, Viber, Zoom, WeChat, and other platforms. Security advocates and authorities around the world have increasingly warned about the threat of cybercriminals using face-swapping tools as part of scams. One concrete measure people can take to help detect potential fraud is to require that the person they are video chatting with waves their hands in front of their face to check for glitches or distortions that could indicate a deepfake. Posts on Telegram also claim that the service supports blowing kisses, blinking, licking lips, or the subject turning or shaking their head. While a version of its software can be downloaded from the Haotian website, the firm has primarily sold its software using subscriptions. A previous version of Haotian's website said a “fully functional” version of its software could cost $4,980 per year, while cheaper packages were also available. Days after Haotian launched its Telegram channel in October 2023, Ngo's research says, the company also set up a Telegram account linked to Huione Guarantee, which is sometimes known as Haowang Guarantee. In January, before Huione Guarantee was shut down and then sanctioned by the US government for helping facilitate scams, researchers estimated that the platform had facilitated more than $24 billion in gray market transactions. Huione Guarantee was Haotian's payment processor and escrow service as well. Evidence of the relationship has been visible for years in Telegram channels related to both companies where customers are completing payments. Tom Robinson, cofounder and chief scientist at the cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic, says cryptocurrency wallets used by Haotian have received 3,558 payments totalling $3.9 million in recent years. There have been more than 3,007 payments in excess of $100, Robinson says, and the biggest incoming transaction to Haotian has been for $14,890, he says, with a “large number” of transactions around $500. “Proceeds of at least 52 known fraud instances had ended up at these wallets,” he says, adding that accounts linked to the fraud incidents were flagged by Elliptic's partners. Andrew Fierman, the head of national security intelligence at cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis, says that Haotian's operations broadly seem similar to those of other companies that operated on the sanctioned Huione Guarantee platform—tech entities that often processed a few hundred thousand dollars or a few million.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The seed round was led by Greylock Partners with participation from Lateralus Holdings and existing backers. Tin Can's colorful screen- and text-free phones aim to help kids connect without the pressures and addictive pull of the digital world. Since launching its flagship product earlier this year, Tin Can quickly went “viral,” sold out its first two production runs and built a near-six-figure waitlist. The momentum comes amid growing concern about the effects of smartphones and social media on kids' mental health, attention and development. Co-founder and CEO Chet Kittleson told GeekWire that his team is “pretty elated” to attract investors who are also parents, who care about what Tin Can is building and want to help the company keep pace with demand. He was head of growth at Stitch Fix for a long time,” Kittleson said. “In an age defined by digital noise, they've created a joyful alternative that redefines how we view modern connection,” he said. Kittleson, along with co-founders Graeme Davies and Max Blumen, previously worked at Seattle real estate startup Far Homes. He was recognized this month as one of GeekWire's six “Uncommon Thinkers,” honoring innovators driving positive change in the world. “I'm so grateful that this is the hit, that it worked,” Kittleson said in a GeekWire profile tied to the honor. Tin Can employs 17 people and is “growing at a pretty fun clip,” Kittleson said. The startup plans to use the new funding to scale production, add engineers and customer support, and prepare for international expansion. Have a scoop that you'd like GeekWire to cover?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's social media company, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), said on Thursday that it's merging with TAE Technologies, a Southern California-based company that has been chasing the dream of fusion power for nearly 30 years. Last week, industry representatives met with Energy Department officials, urging them to help direct billions of dollars toward fusion projects, and earlier this year, the DOE announced a new roadmap to guide commercial efforts in the sector, though it didn't commit any new funds alongside the announcement. TMTG went public last year via a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), a technique used to go public by private companies that want to raise money quickly but aren't yet mature enough to take the traditional IPO route. Truth Social and the company's streaming platform have failed to generate much revenue, but TMTG has nevertheless managed to amass $3.1 billion in assets, largely through its cryptocurrency investments and partnerships. TMTG CEO Devin Nunes, formerly a Republican congressman, stated that the company's acquisition of TAE would “cement America's global energy dominance for generations.” The companies said they plan to site and begin construction on “the world's first utility-scale fusion power plant (50 MWe)” next year, and have plans for more fusion plants that are expected to generate between 350 megawatts to 500 megawatts of electricity. But the path forward for fusion power remains uncertain. Currently, only one experimental device has proven that controlled fusion reactions can generate more power than they consume. If one or more fusion startups succeed, they could deliver gigawatts of clean, continuous power to the grid using nothing more than hydrogen isotopes filtered from seawater. When particles in the plasma collide, they merge to form a new, heavier atom while releasing tremendous amounts of heat, which can be harvested to generate electricity. TAE has been working on a range of fusion devices since the late 1990s. The company has raised nearly $2 billion in total, including a recent $150 million round from existing investors including Google, Chevron Technology Ventures, and New Enterprise. The company has been valued at about $1.8 billion, according to PitchBook. Over the years, TAE has struggled to make its various designs work. Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the past five months, astronomers around the world have meticulously tracked a strange visitor from another solar system as it zips through our own. Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will fly by our planet at a safe distance of 1.8 astronomical units (roughly 167 million miles or 270 million kilometers) at 1 a.m. ET on Friday, December 19, according to calculations by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. You won't be able to see 3I/ATLAS with the naked eye, but you could catch a fuzzy, faint glimpse of it in the predawn sky through a powerful pair of binoculars or a backyard telescope. ET on Thursday, December 18, and you can watch it below. This astronomical program, overseen by the Bellatrix Astronomical Observatory in Italy, uses remotely controlled telescopes to provide real-time observations of space. This comet is considered “interstellar” because it hails from another star system. 3I/ATLAS's Friday fly-by will be especially valuable for science. This will be astronomers' best opportunity to observe the comet and gather data before it leaves our solar system for good. In the months since the NASA-funded ATLAS observatory discovered 3I/ATLAS on July 1, researchers have been working tirelessly to study its chemistry and composition. Their findings have led to multiple hypotheses about 3I/ATLAS's origin. One early study suggested it came from an ancient star system in a region of the Milky Way called the thick disk. This region surrounds the thin disk (where our solar system lies) and contains older stars. A later study contradicted this idea, pointing to the thin disk instead. Even if astronomers can't narrow down 3I/ATLAS's origin any further, studying its characteristics can tell us more about what its home system is like. For example, researchers have found that the comet is chock-full of carbon dioxide, suggesting it formed in an environment with higher levels of radiation than our solar system. 3I/ATLAS is zooming through space incredibly fast—it reached its maximum speed of 153,000 miles per hour (246,000 kilometers per hour) when it made its closest approach to the Sun in late October. After Friday, it will slowly fade into the distance as it travels deeper into the outer solar system, so you won't want to miss this opportunity to see it up close—relatively speaking. More specifically, you'll need to star-hop with your telescope from Regulus to the magnitude 3.8 star Rho Leonis, then look half that distance in the same direction until you see a small, misty smudge. There are plenty of astronomy apps available to help you locate the comet, such as Stellarium or SkyView. But if you want to save yourself the trouble, you can see 3I/ATLAS in more detail via the Virtual Telescope Project's livestream. No matter how you choose to watch, witnessing such a rare and scientifically spectacular event will be well worth it. For more than a decade, scientists have accepted that Titan, Saturn's biggest moon, has a subsurface ocean of liquid water. A new look at the data suggests otherwise. MAVEN has circled Mars for more than a decade, exploring the planet and relaying data from robots on the surface.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereal Exploration Guild, an Indian spacetech startup better known as EtherealX — developing a fully reusable medium-lift launch vehicle — is close to securing about $21 million in a new funding round co-led by TDK Ventures, with Accel among the participants, TechCrunch has learned. Initially planned as a $15 million Series A, the round has drawn strong investor demand and is now expected to reach about $20.5 million, three people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The funding talks follow EtherealX securing $130 million worth of contracts from six customers, the sources told TechCrunch, underscoring early commercial demand for its launch services. Founded in 2022 by Manu J. Nair alongside former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) scientist Shubhayu Sardar, who serves as chief operating officer, and aerospace engineer Prashant Sharma, the chief technology officer, EtherealX is aiming to take on SpaceX with a medium-lift launch vehicle called Razor Crest Mk-1. In an interview with TechCrunch last year, Nair said EtherealX's rocket could offer launch prices ranging from about $350 to $2,000 per kilogram. India has emerged as one of the few countries globally with a geographic and regulatory advantage for space launches, offering access to multiple orbital inclinations from a single launch site. Its growing spacetech ecosystem is also attracting global investors seeking markets that can complement space development in the United States, Europe, and other key regions. The startup has also been developing key components, including a liquid oxygen (LOX) turbopump assembly for its upper-stage engine, known as Pegasus 2.0, according to a recent LinkedIn post by Nair last week. The country is working toward a $40 billion to $45 billion space economy within the next eight to 10 years, Indian Space Minister Jitendra Singh said recently.

For example, I was able to edit a family reminder: changing the assigned person, adjusting the date and time, setting it to repeat weekly, and adding a flag for Alexa to follow up until it's complete. This made Alexa a lot more useful on its own. Now, with the online portal, it's much easier to upload, access and delete files. There's also some nice smart home integration, with the ability to control lights and plugs, for example. In short, it's a level of point-and-click precision that voice commands and the mobile app can't offer. Within a few minutes of using Alexa.com, I had this sense of liberation, being able to interact with Alexa in the same way as anything else on the computer. Three years after the launch of ChatGPT, my AI routines have become relatively entrenched. I'm having a hard time envisioning going to Alexa.com on my computer to start a chat rather than Gemini, NotebookLM, Claude, Perplexity or other AI tools that have become daily habits. Then again, for me, those tools are about work and individual tasks. Alexa is really the digital hub for my family. The Alexa+ integration goes even further for me since I've been talking to Alexa more and more via my Amazon Echo Buds on my phone when I'm out and about, although this is probably more illustrative of me being an edge case than anything else. It's the consumer-facing layer for a company that has made a much bigger mark in AI with its cloud infrastructure and platforms. But for now, the simple act of using an AI-powered Alexa in a web browser is so mind-blowing, in such a basic way, that it's hard not to wonder how much further along Amazon would be in the world of consumer AI if it had been able to make this happen a long time ago.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A report from the Washington Post on Wednesday revealed that HHS has abruptly revoked millions in federal funding from the non-profit organization. The AAP has regularly criticized RFK Jr. this year for making changes to the country's vaccine policies unbacked by evidence. Just this week, HHS officially endorsed the end of a decades-long recommendation to universally vaccinate children against hepatitis B starting at birth. “The sudden withdrawal of these funds will directly impact and potentially harm infants, children, youth, and their families in communities across the United States,” Mark Del Monte, AAP's CEO and executive vice president, said in a statement to the Washington Post. For instance, the agency took issue that some of the grants were being used for research projects that contained “identity-based language.” In another case, the funded research purportedly didn't focus enough on nutrition and chronic disease prevention—areas that Kennedy has claimed his HHS is emphasizing more than ever before. ‘We Are Doing Harm': RFK Jr.'s ACIP Guts Universal Hep B Vaccination at Birth In a statement to the Post, a HHS spokesperson said that the AAP grants and others were revoked for no longer aligning “with the Department's mission or priorities.” Of course, it's no secret that the AAP and RFK Jr. aren't exactly on the best of terms these days. On Wednesday, for instance, the organization and others were in federal court as part of an ongoing lawsuit against Kennedy. The AAP is arguing that RFK's unilateral decision to remove the covid-19 vaccine from the CDC-recommended immunization schedules for children and pregnant women runs afoul of federal law. The AAP, and many other experts, have also lambasted RFK Jr. for hijacking the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, for instance. Susan Monarez, the former CDC director, has alleged she was fired in August this year for refusing to accept, without review, the recommendations of the new ACIP; several senior CDC officials resigned in protest following her firing. Without any adults in the room, Kennedy has continued to run roughshod over the country's public health system. Over the last few weeks, he's pushed the CDC to boost the debunked link between vaccines and autism, endorsed conspiracies about Lyme disease, and tried to blame antidepressants for causing mass shootings despite next to little evidence supporting such a link. Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more. Kennedy has previously argued that Lyme is "highly likely to have been a military weapon."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The issue of airbnb is a sticky one. On one hand, being able to temporarily live in an apartment greatly enhances the immersiveness when your travel - you get to feel like a local and experience life in another place. Hotels suck as they cut corners to the point where an article posted here complaining about the lack of bathroom doors in hotels. On the other hand, these rentals drive up real estate prices and drives out locals. And often these rentals are in run-down low-income turning affordable yet poor quality housing into high quality temporary rentals. This drives out low income residents deepening income inequality issues while subjecting them to the threat of homelessness.As long as we tolerate a society that only values ROI while ignoring the value of investing in humanity we won't resolve any of these issues. It's not hard, we have an abundance of materials and labor yet we have built a culture where helping others is some form of weakness for both parties.

This problem exists regardless of who does the buying.

On my street 30% of the houses are short-term rentals. Not only are all the houses now priced as income-producing investments, they are killing the community that used to exist here.

Sure, the problem is balancing that with the desire of tourists that want something better than a hotel. Certainly, there is a tug of war between tourist dollars vs negative tourist impact, but this math is a function of how impactful tourist decline (if any) would occur by pushing out short term rentals. Real estate and politics are local, as the sayings go. AirBnB pushed negative externalities on local jurisdictions to achieve their valuation and economic success ("socialize the losses, privatize the gains"), and these efforts are just pushing them back in some form. Tourists should remember that they are guests in the places that host them, and it is a privilege to be hosted. That's exactly what we're not tolerating here in Spain. We have guaranteed right to "decent and adequate housing" enshrined in the constitution, which is why you're seeing these aggressive moves against companies that actively work against us having that.I guess we in Spain are a bit of guinea pigs regarding this, as we've been hit hard by Airbnb et al, but we also have strong social movements trying to fight back, and right now being a bit successful. Gonna be interesting to see how it looks like in 5-10 years again, once we start to see the effect of the new laws passed these last few years.

Gonna be interesting to see how it looks like in 5-10 years again, once we start to see the effect of the new laws passed these last few years. I am not one to defend big companies, but for some people here Airbnb was freedom. Now they have to go work cleaning rooms or just collect retirement checks, as obtaining a license to run a hotel is impossible without political connections / corruption. If the economics work out for landlords, a city can lose a lot of apartments to short term rentals way faster than it could increase supply. Especially in central districts where significant new construction is barely possible. But one does not exclude the other, if you look up the "Spain" tag on your favorite international news source I'm sure you can dig out the other measures being taken currently. Again, many small streams make a big river. Not one single action or new law will instantly fix the issue, you patch what you can and incrementally work towards something better. If they don't want to leave because the rent is OK and they like living there, why should they move?I guess one fundamental difference with Spain VS US or probably many other countries, is that here in Spain we have "the right to housing" enshrined in our constitution.

I wonder if they all wiped out by the crisis (subprime really hit spain hard), and what we are seeing now is the consequence of that wipeout, and bankruptcies. Problem is that it's in areas where people don't want to live. and prices keep going up.Add in that salaries are pretty low so cost of living is subsequently low, so you end up with a ton of "expats" and other fun folks like "foreign investors" who purchase up all the livable/rentable properties with their "higher value" money, because everything is so cheap for them.Owners realize this, and while the government is (now at least) trying to put a stop to all of this with limiting rent increases and more, owners still try to take advantage of it as much as they can.Personally, I think we need to temporarily put a complete halt to non-residents buying any sort of properties or even land here, at least for a short period of time so the people who actually live and work here can recover from the situation.For the average person with a normal job here and not working for foreign companies with a higher salary, it's short of impossible to be able to afford to eventually buy a house.

This is a big generalization but I think it's broadly true.If you are in a "resource" area you'll get pollution and often instability and war.If you are in a "playground" area you get massive cost increases and are eventually forced out.As the trend is toward concentrating more and more wealth at the top, the slice of rich who can afford to enjoy the playgrounds becomes smaller and the number of refugees, homeless, and poor becomes larger and poorer.

That list does not make much sense, because it mostly consists of small municipalities that have been engulfed by growing metropolitan areas. Four of the five Spanish entries are like that, three in Valencia and one in Barcelona; and most other entries in the top 20 are suburbs of Paris, Athens or Naples. > A city proper is the geographical area contained within city limitsI'm not sure about the others, but the one from Barcelona is a city actually, with their own local government and all, separate from Barcelona, exactly like Badalona on the other end of Barcelona. It is within the city-limits of Barcelona (region, not city) though.

It is within the city-limits of Barcelona (region, not city) though. I have nothing against short or medium term rentals. If they are limited percentage of housing as total. I don't like AirBnB and I'm glad they got fined, but the Spanish government also needs to accept that they have been sitting around doing nothing for roughly 20 years. Looks like politicians all over will do everything in their power except actually building more apartments. Not great for prices (Ryanair is complaining about high landing fees) but it does mean tourists have a good job being dispersed into the countryside and having a good experience. Granted, I now live outside of Barcelona after moving here from an island with ~700 people on it, so for me pretty much any city is big, but I'm fairly sure Barcelona is within top 100 worldwide in terms of population living in it, so I'm guessing you're saying "not a large city" by some other metric? They wouldn't build government owned and operated houses? A lot of other European governments took on too much public debt and had to enforce austerity measures. And meanwhile, getting any kind of building permits is super hard so there's only a trickle of new property being built that lags behind demand.There's a real estate bubble where real estate value outgrows inflation structurally. To the point where a normal person with a normal income has basically no chance at all at finding anything decent on the market.The solution of building more housing and making it easier for property owners to rent out their property are consistently not happening. The Netherlands actually has large amounts of empty property where the owners prefer to not rent it out and keep their investment liquid because it's such a PITA to get out of an agreement. There's also a history of privatized housing corporations selling off their property to make some quick money for the share holders. The net result is a huge mess of private property that is either not rented out or rented out at extortion prices. At the same time there's also growing amount of empty commercial real estate. Things like Airbnb are more like a symptom than the cause of this.The way I see it, house construction should not be expensive. You are instead expected to pay extortion rents or buy your own 500K piece of shit tiny apartment that is actually smaller and less comfortable than the bloody camper. Houses without wheels should be much simpler to make. Prefab housing is kind of a solved problem. Any idiot can construct a garden shed in an afternoon. If the rules were different, most big cities would have huge slums with campers and other improvised housing. But when policy breaks down, slums like that become the next logical level of this crisis.A good example of exemptions in the Netherlands are so-called holiday homes where people live permanently; despite this clearly being illegal. Evicting people would create an unsolvable problem for bureaucrats. And of course recreational units tend to be in nice places too. If tens of thousands of people start parking their campers on the edge of town bureaucrats would struggle to address the issue without creating a bigger crisis.Probably something like this will force a solution eventually.

If the rules were different, most big cities would have huge slums with campers and other improvised housing.

Evicting people would create an unsolvable problem for bureaucrats. And of course recreational units tend to be in nice places too. If tens of thousands of people start parking their campers on the edge of town bureaucrats would struggle to address the issue without creating a bigger crisis.Probably something like this will force a solution eventually. The solution of building more housing and making it easier for property owners to rent out their property are consistently not happening. The Netherlands actually has large amounts of empty property where the owners prefer to not rent it out and keep their investment liquid because it's such a PITA to get out of an agreement. There's also a history of privatized housing corporations selling off their property to make some quick money for the share holders. The net result is a huge mess of private property that is either not rented out or rented out at extortion prices. At the same time there's also growing amount of empty commercial real estate.

Is there something else you're trying to hint at that you don't dare to say out loud perhaps? A lot of cities like Paris and Amsterdam have this issue with short-term renting. "Build moar" is just not really an option for these type of city.Firstly, the constructible area of the city is limited. And it can be slow since it means having to expel industry and agriculture further to rezone area into constructible home/office area. So the other option is to build up, which means destroying potentially historic building, changing the skyline and viewpoint. This would be bad for tourism (and people who live here might not like it either), since this is a big reason why people even come to visit.In the past, cities had simple way to deal with this. With zoning and hotel licences, the city could have a real urban plan on how it wanted to evolve and how much space it wanted to dedicate to tourism vs industry vs offices vs homes. Greed and capitalism took advantage of that and the number of place to rent or buy descreased significantly in favour of short term tourism rental, making living in the city slowly unaffordable.Building more is not that simple.

By trying to make them all historic you ensure they are all lost and the few that really are historic can't stand out for the history they represent. Save what is really history, but not everything.Similarly, the skyline will change. It's a lot more selfish and malicious than that. They want to remain housed affordably, so they support rent control, but they don't care about the city being affordable in general or for anyone not already living there. Often they outright oppose it (because those moving in would be ethnic minorities or poorer, with concerns about crime), but they disguise their racism with ridiculous aesthetic preferences about "skylines" and "shadows" and "neighborhood character", block highrises, block most construction, and you end up with rent controls for current residents but years long wait lists. Working 100% as designed.What locals in attractive locations really want is to restrict supply, because the majority are homeowners and want to preserve their paper net worth.

Sure, everyone wants their particular city to be frozen in time for cuteness and nostalgia reasons. However, it sort of assumes that the sociopolitical environment is also frozen (it isn't).so instead you end up with voters voting against densification because, essentially, "I got mine."p.s. i'm not sure that places that banned/heavily restricted airbnb experienced a meaningful decline in rental prices (e.g. new york, san francisco, vancouver, etc). new york is one of the most popular tourist destinations and incredibly built up, and doesn't seem to have issues with tourists wanting to visit. and these also still have their quintessential historic/preserved areas, too. so instead you end up with voters voting against densification because, essentially, "I got mine."p.s. i'm not sure that places that banned/heavily restricted airbnb experienced a meaningful decline in rental prices (e.g. new york, san francisco, vancouver, etc). new york is one of the most popular tourist destinations and incredibly built up, and doesn't seem to have issues with tourists wanting to visit. and these also still have their quintessential historic/preserved areas, too. i'm not sure that places that banned/heavily restricted airbnb experienced a meaningful decline in rental prices (e.g. new york, san francisco, vancouver, etc). new york is one of the most popular tourist destinations and incredibly built up, and doesn't seem to have issues with tourists wanting to visit. and these also still have their quintessential historic/preserved areas, too. new york is one of the most popular tourist destinations and incredibly built up, and doesn't seem to have issues with tourists wanting to visit. and these also still have their quintessential historic/preserved areas, too. As long as it wasn't profitable for them to do bad stuff (which it wasn't, since the fine is 6 times the size of their profits from that period of time), I'm happy enough about. I know it's always been a bit of a financial asset, but the past 40 years have really seen this accelerate to pretty crazy levels. The issue, when you boil it down to the basics is: wealthy folks, development companies, overseas oligarchs, hedge funds, etc. This means that rents go up and short-term-rentals become more viable. This also means that young middle-class families can't afford to purchase or to live there, so it pushes out locals (this is especially bad in Lisbon).The solution seems to be government telling you what you can or you can't do with your private property, which does not sit well with me, but it's becoming more and more clear that this can't go on forever.

I like what Singapore is doing - having a government built “base level” of housing that is both abundant and readily available - it can anchor the price where deep excesses are harder to end up with.It's like a market where a very significant player keeps the price law, because of its own reasons.In such a scenario the price will not go up as sharply, so there would be less incentive for people to buy real estate just as a financial vehicle.And the government can also prioritise who it sells the units it builds to - e.g. not investors.I honestly am surprised why western governments are not trying this.

Then along came 'right-to-buy', allowing tenants to buy their social housing for knock down prices (and so become a natural Tory [right of centre party] voter).If councils had been allowed to use the money to build more social housing, then maybe this was fine. So now we have affordability issues in the UK too. If councils had been allowed to use the money to build more social housing, then maybe this was fine. So now we have affordability issues in the UK too. I was surprised since you are such a prolific commentator. There are so many empty and decaying homes all over Europe, in Italy they sell houses for 1 Euro. Yes there's a catch but that catch is that you are supposed to renovate the house for a cost that ranges from 20K euros to 100K euros and this is still quite cheap considering that you end up with a proper house at a picturesque location. But you still need to build more housing obviously But an economy built on being a trendy expat location is not sustainable. Expats will leave to a new place eventually, and then the city is dead. This dynamic is accelerated by the fact that locals are forced out when expacts come, but the city was attractive in the first place because of how charming locals made it.If you run the city - and imagine it's a company, and you're the CEO - you can see that your city is falling for a hype train that will eventually kill it. The smart thing is to not let that hype train happen.Because expat purchase power is a mutliple of your locals, you need to find other levers.

Because expat purchase power is a mutliple of your locals, you need to find other levers. Yes, it's you being both ignorant and american. This argument quite directly, without any slopes (slippery or not), extends to for example acquiring a piece of land, building some housing at premium costs and then slapping a factory (and waste landifill, for a good measure) on the rest of the lot.Housing regulations exists for many abundant reasons. Living quarters vs short-time rentals drastically change requirements for and load on surrounding infrastructure, which is built out based on established zoning. Living quarters vs short-time rentals drastically change requirements for and load on surrounding infrastructure, which is built out based on established zoning. Between zoning, easements, nuisance laws, government has a lot of say in how you use your private property. Owners even stepped it up a notch and invited HOAs, a quasi-government that has even more say about your property.Unfortunately, people love telling their neighbors how they should live. Unfortunately, people love telling their neighbors how they should live. In an economy where there is a housing shortage local population needs affordable and long-term (6-months+) rental contracts or they don't have stability.Capitalism is great in general, but some things, such as healthcare, housing, electricity,... needs to have a stronger regulatory framework then eg TVs since the collapse of basic human necessities creates chaos and eventually becomes the foothold of extreme socialist/communist political parties which then finish the job of destroying the economy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Until early October, I was happy with my prepaid phone service. I moved my cell service to budget prepaid plans nearly a decade ago, and have gone through a half-dozen services since, including Mint and Boost. Then I took my 10-year-old daughter to see a Chappell Roan concert. My phone was on Visible Wireless at the time, and my traffic was fully deprioritized at an event where seemingly 30,000 people were simultaneously posting stories and snaps ahead of me. T-Mobile recently announced a new service that lets you switch to the carrier in just 15 minutes, along with same-day delivery of your new smartphone. As someone who goes through multiple cheap prepaid carriers every few years, I'm used to battling my cell service provider. I've spent hours and hours trying to port my lines or get a device I paid cash for unlocked so I could use it overseas (there's a reason why we only recommend you buy unlocked smartphones). I have been pushed past the brink of Karendom and even resorted to filing an FCC complaint over one carrier's practices. I have consistently been frustrated with the difficulty of switching carriers and have come to believe it's painful by design. T-Mobile's new 15-minute switching feature only works if you use the carrier's app, and I wanted to discuss my options, so I called. I found it helpful, and it's the only way I would advise an older person like my mom to interact with a cell carrier. I opted for the mid-tier Experience More plan, which, for $85 per month, offers unlimited data and calling, plus 60 gigs of high-speed mobile hotspot data, and some free data in Canada, Mexico, and several other countries. Also, I can text and use the internet on a plane. That bright orange iPhone 17 Pro has been calling my name. I was ineligible for a trade-in given the condition of my old phone, so I looked at what promotions the carrier was offering. T-Mobile is currently offering the regular iPhone 17 for free with a 2-year contract. I was facing a $32 increase in switching from Visible, but got $35 in monthly device credits with no interest, meaning I'm actually getting back $3 per month. T-Mobile's other big boast is same-day delivery on your device. Unfortunately, while I could have gotten this with the standard iPhone 17 or the regular iPhone 17 Pro, same-day delivery wasn't available for the Pro Max in orange in my area (especially considering I finished my order around 6 pm). Instead, I arranged for next-day pickup from a local T-Mobile store. I drove 1.2 miles to the T-Mobile store, showed them my driver's license, and was home within 15 minutes. All told, I had less than an hour of my time sunk into the switch. Also, apparently, I can now get a free Slurpee from 7/11 every month as part of the promotion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Working Families Party said Thursday that it is putting out a specific recruitment call for people who are organizing against data centers in their communities to run for office. The announcement comes amid a period of heightened political turmoil around data centers, as some high-profile Democrats wade into the fight. Earlier this week, three Democrats in the Senate sent letters seeking information from Big Tech companies about how data centers impact electricity bills, while senator Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont, became the first national politician to call for a moratorium on data center construction. “We see our role as responding to what working families and working people are concerned about, what issues are keeping them up at night,” says Ravi Mangla, the national press secretary for the Working Families Party. “We would be ignoring the needs of our constituents if we were not responding to the issue of data centers and their impacts on communities.” While it (mostly) doesn't seat candidates independently, the progressive third party's endorsements and organizing power can carry real weight in the races where it chooses to get involved. Polling from the outlet Heatmap released in September shows that less than half of Americans of all political persuasions would welcome a data center being built near where they live, while a recent survey from a private industry group shows that community opposition increased in the second quarter of this year, successfully stalling or stopping billions of dollars in data center development. Concern over data centers played a role in a number of midterm elections, including factoring into several races in Virginia, which has the highest concentration of data centers in the country and is facing rising demands for energy from more facilities projected to come online through the end of the decade. In the past week, officials in Chandler, Arizona voted 7-0 to reject a proposed data center in the city, despite high-profile lobbying from former senator Kyrsten Sinema, while voters in Georgia on Tuesday elected a newcomer to the state legislature who has promised legislation to make data centers “pay their fair share.” “There are people who are clearly stepping up in their communities, organizing their neighbors, and leading the charge to push back against these data centers.” Mangla says that they hope to expand the focus to other areas with a lot of data center organizing, like Georgia, depending on interest. Data centers have been around for years in Virginia. (That district—which includes some of Loudoun County, one of the world's densest data center regions, and which went to Trump in 2024—flipped this year.) Nationally, the politics around data centers are in flux, as tech companies pour more money into building data centers to fuel the AI race—and as more opposition pops up in areas where they're being built. Some high-profile Democrats have shown support for the buildout in their states. (He did sign a bill that tasks the state's Public Utilities Commission with investigating whether or not increased electric demand from data centers could shift onto ratepayers.) data centers' energy usage has caused residential electricity bills to skyrocket in nearby communities.” A moratorium, Sanders said, “will give democracy a chance to catch up, and ensure that the benefits of technology work for all of us, not just the 1 percent.” On Wednesday, Sanders's team released a separate video that highlighted the climate and water impacts of data centers. “We're seeing their data centers invading and taking over our own communities. I think more than ever the presence of Big Tech is not just something that is limited to Silicon Valley …we're seeing it in all parts of our lives, and the negative impacts that are coming from a tech industry that doesn't want to be regulated.” Earlier this month, Florida governor Ron deSantis called for limits on data centers in Florida as part of a bill that could regulate AI in the state. “A lot of the opposition to these projects is led locally in rural areas,” says Francis. “There aren't folks showing up in Birkenstocks at these public hearings. It's not necessarily a super climate activist type of thing.” The recruitment call, Mangla stresses, is open to candidates of all political persuasions organizing against data centers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Called Greetings, the feature helps Ring determine who is visiting your house based on their apparel, actions, and what they are holding, and responds accordingly. The feature adds settings that let you specify where delivery people can leave packages, and direct them toward water or snacks you might have kept out. You can set an instruction such as “If someone comes to the door trying to sell something, politely let them know we're not interested.” And if you're busy or not home, Alexa can greet friends or family when they visit, and ask them to leave a message for you. It goes without saying that the tech presents the risk of misidentifying people and responding inappropriately — if, for example, a friend works in logistics and comes to see you after work in their delivery uniform, Ring may, via Alexa, ask them to leave a package somewhere instead of letting them leave a message. The new feature follows a controversial facial recognition feature for Ring called “Familiar Faces” that lets you create a catalog of the faces of up to 50 people who visit you regularly. Once labeled, these people will be named in the Ring app's timeline and notifications when they visit. It is rolling out to Alexa+ Early access customers in the U.S. and Canada.

Even a budget-priced gaming mic can drastically improve your audio setup — and the best gaming mics start at just $60. While its specs aren't wildly different from those of the original SoloCast, it has a brand-new build that feels much sturdier, features a clever built-in stand, and adds a large tap-to-mute button on top. Not bad for $60 (available now, in black). HyperX's second-generation budget-friendly USB microphone is a pretty neat-looking update: the mic is housed in a matte-black plastic chassis that measures 6 inches (152.4mm) long by 2.08 inches (53mm) in diameter. Under this grille, there's a foam pop filter and an internal shock mount — the 14mm electret condenser capsule is suspended inside the chassis to prevent any interference from desk vibrations (as it is, after all, a desktop microphone). There's a hinge at the back of the cylinder that lets you tilt the microphone back 40 degrees — angling it so it's directed at your face, if you're sitting at a desk. There's a bright red indicator light at the bottom of the mic (tilting the mic up also angles this light toward your face, so you won't miss it) that tells you whether the mic is muted or recording. It's red when the mic is recording, which threw me off... quite a bit, honestly, as many gaming microphones with RGB lighting default to red when they're muted. Aside from its neat little built-in stand, the SoloCast 2 is pretty simple. On the bottom, there's a mounting point that's compatible with both 3/8" and 5/8" threaded mounts, so you can fold the microphone up and mount it — stand and all — on a boom arm or mic stand.

The SoloCast 2 records sound at a high-res 24-bit / 96 kHz bit-depth / sample rate (recording studio level), but so does the original SoloCast thanks to a firmware update HyperX pushed out in 2022. This is essentially a plug-n-play mic, and it sounds pretty good out of the box. Vocals sound full and rounded, though not quite as clean as they sound on the Logitech Yeti Orb. My voice had a decent amount of depth and detail in both recordings and streams, and the mic also offers a nice proximity effect (though the built-in stand is too low for this to be comfortable). The SoloCast 2 has a built-in internal shock mount and pop filter, but they're both on the weaker side: the mic picked up both desk movement and plosives very, very easily in my testing. In other words, we definitely recommend mounting this mic on a boom arm. The mic does pick up a lot of background noise — my fans were ever-present in my testing, but vocals still came across strong and clear. There are some settings you can tweak in HyperX's Ngenuity Beta software that work pretty well to reduce noise and clean up the sound in general, but that has its own issues. However, mounting the mic on a boom arm did a lot to at least reduce any noise from desk movement and typing. The SoloCast 2 works with HyperX's Ngenuity Beta software, which gives you a handful of options for adjusting the mic's tone. This is where you can adjust the mic's gain (there's no on-mic gain control, unfortunately), and turn on a handful of software-based improvements, such as high / low pass filters and AI noise reduction. You can also adjust the mic's sound using a simple 10-band equalizer. You can add and save as many EQ presets as you want; the software doesn't come with any built-in presets. At $60, it's the same price as the Logitech Yeti Orb (the Yeti Orb debuted at $60 in 2023 and received a price increase to $70, but is currently back at $60 on sale). While I do like the Yeti Orb's out-of-the-box sound better, the SoloCast 2's tap-to-mute is a much more convenient feature — especially as the Yeti Orb has no on-mic controls. Assuming you're using this mic for more casual chatting with friends, teammates, and coworkers, this is likely to be pretty essential (so long as you remember that red means recording).

A North Korean imposter was uncovered, working as a sysadmin at Amazon U.S., after their keystroke input lag raised suspicions with security specialists at the online retail giant. Normally, a U.S.-based remote worker's computer would send keystroke data within tens of milliseconds. This suspicious individual's keyboard lag was “more than 110 milliseconds,” reports Bloomberg. Amazon is commendably proactive in its pursuit of impostors, according to the source report. The news site talked with Amazon's Chief Security Officer, Stephen Schmidt, about this fascinating new case of North Koreans trying to infiltrate U.S. organizations to raise hard currency for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), and sometimes indulge in espionage and/or sabotage. Schmidt says that Amazon has foiled more than 1,800 DPRK infiltration attempts since April 2024. Moreover, the rate of attempts continues apace, with Amazon reckoning it is seeing a 27% QoQ uplift in North Koreans trying to get into the Amazon corporation. However, Amazon's success can be almost entirely credited to the fact that it is actively looking for DPRK impostors, warns its Chief Security Officer. With this company policy explained, a blip on the Amazon security radar was caused earlier this year when a new sysadmin's Amazon laptop monitor alerted security personnel about unusual behavior. Schmidt emphasizes that good-quality security software was key to this investigation. It turns out that the DPRK had access to this Amazon laptop located in Arizona. A woman found to be facilitating this fraud on behalf of North Korean imposter workers was sentenced to several years in prison earlier this year.

As well as red flag computer network symptoms, the fumbling use of American idioms and English-language articles continues to be a giveaway when conversing with such impostors. The problem of North Koreans infiltrating U.S. corporations for profit, mischief, and more is undoubtedly a serious one.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reports are now filtering through all the business chatter about exactly how much dough Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav stands to make from the company's big sale. And, inevitably, it's a jaw-dropping sum no matter who ends up taking control of the media empire. In this case that means raking in as much money as possible for shareholders, “especially if a bidding war escalates and drives Paramount's hostile $30 per share offer even higher, or if Netflix needs to raise its offer.” THR reported that Zaslav stands to earn “$30 million in ‘golden parachute' compensation, along with $537 million in equity, for a total of $567 million.” His underlings, who will benefit as much as he will if a bidding war breaks out and raises stock prices, are also poised for riches, topped off by Gunnar Wiedenfels, “Zaslav's longtime lieutenant, current CFO, and soon-to-be CEO of spinoff firm Discovery Global,” who's set to get $5 million in cash and $138 million in equity. This is, mind you, on top of the salaries these people already earn (Zaslav is atop the pyramid with “$51.9 million in pay packages last year”). No matter what, Zaslav stands to come out like a king—$567 million is equivalent to approximately eight Coyote vs. Acmes or six Batgirls, to name-check a couple of titles notoriously associated with his reign at WB.

The horror master's passion project has such lavish production design, its relics literally belong in a museum. Eywa as his witness, James Cameron has pledged to make movies for theaters so that side of the business stays alive. Wait, is the government actually going to do something about this?</p>
