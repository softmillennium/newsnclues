                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Genetic differences are only the beginning of acquiring this rare ability. In fact, there is growing scientific evidence that it's not. Most people have three types of cone cells in the eye that perceive color, but some people are born with a fourth type that lets them see colors the rest of us don't even have names for. But, understanding whether their visual world is richer than ours brings us back to the original problem: how would we know? Color is not a fixed property of an object, but rather an experience created in our brains as signals travel from the cones in the retina. About 12 percent of all women—including up to 50 percent of Caucasian women—carry a gene that produces an extra photopigment on their X chromosome, a light-sensitive molecule in the cone cell. Whereas most people, called trichromats, have three cones with photopigments tuned to red, blue, and green, tetrachromats have a fourth. “If someone truly had four-dimensional color vision, we could never know what that looks like to them,” visual neuroscientist Jenny Bosten, PhD, says. “All we can do is infer it from whether they discriminate colors in ways that their extra cone class would predict.” In 2010, Bosten, who is a professor at the University of Sussex in the UK, and her colleagues set out to do just that. The women were shown numerous pairs of carefully chosen color spectra that scientists predicted should look identical to trichromats, but distinct to tetrachromats. Just like a color-blind person (dichromat) cannot distinguish certain hues of red and green, a trichromat has similar blind spots. Her performance remains some of the strongest empirical evidence for functional tetrachromacy in humans. 🔮 Check Out Our New Video Series, Pop Mech Explains: PrecognitionYou've probably had that eerie feeling before—knowing what's about to happen before it actually does. A text from someone you were just thinking about. Does this mean most cases of true tetrachromacy are extremely rare? Having this ability could depend on cone sensitivity, environmental factors, or limitations of the testing. Normal trichromats have peak sensitivities separated by about 30 nanometers. Additionally, a person's environment could influence this genetic potential. “Mozart was gifted in terms of his auditory system, but if he were raised in a family of goat herds, he may have never become a great composer,” she says. He has studied how people in tropical environments might calibrate their vision over time so that lush greens and vivid blues become less intense. And people living in arid landscapes devoid of color do the opposite. He says that the world is built for trichromats, in which nearly all displays, pigments, and lighting are engineered around three primary colors, and a fourth photopigment might provide information that the brain simply learns to ignore. “When your grandkids move to Mars, it won't look red to them … if you're living in a red world, it just looks grey,” he says. Tetrachromats report seeing colors in the places trichromats can't. Whites become prismatic, dark shadows contain hues of lavender and gold. At his lab at UC Berkeley, computer scientist Ren Ng, PhD, aims to develop an empirical test for tetrachromacy, just like the color-blindness tests that show circles of colored dots containing hidden numbers. So far, instead of a color wheel, Ng has created a three-dimensional color sphere to capture the fourth cone's extra dimension. “For tetrachromats, the entire geometry of color space changes,” he tells Popular Mechanics. “Where you see gray, a tetrachromat might see a completely different hue; maybe an entire ring of hues,” he says. Ng's team built this four-dimensional color sphere by modeling the colors that a human with four cones might see. In the process, he even predicted the existence of two new colors, “keef” and “litz,” named after artists Georgia O'Keeffe and photographer Alfred Stieglitz. To a trichromat, they just look grey, but a tetrachromat should be able to see these colors pop against the others. Next, his team built a specialized printer with four inks instead of three. The standard colors used in trichromatic printers are cyan, magenta, and yellow, but in Ng's tetrachromatic version, they used four: cyan, violet, pink, and yellow.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Particles that escaped Earth's atmosphere accumulated on the lunar surface over billions of years. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. When samples of lunar dust touched down with returning astronauts during the Apollo era, it was still unknown that those containers held molecules that had journeyed from Earth to the Moon and back. Later analysis of Apollo 17 samples revealed volatile elements and substances (like water and carbon dioxide) in the loose regolith that were not found in rocks collected on the mission. The researchers thought that this was the only way such particles could have made it past Earth, since they would have supposedly been held back by a magnetic field once it was up and running. Paramanick thinks that most of these particles travel via Earth's magnetotail, which is formed by the solar wind as it pushes against one side of Earth's magnetosphere. Because of turbulence, unstable plasma, and magnetic reconnection (when magnetic field lines break and connect again) occurring within the magnetotail, atmospheric particles from Earth are released. They can then travel along magnetic field lines in the magnetotail until solar wind takes them. “Atmospheric transfer is efficient only when the Moon is within Earth's magnetotail,” Paramanick said in a study recently published in Nature Communications Earth & Environment. As molten metals in the outer core undergo convection—with gravity causing hotter and less dense material to rise as cooler and denser material to sink—a magnetic field arises from electrical charges in motion. Earth's magnetic field is 3.7 billion years old, and over those years, the shifting of terrestrial particles to the Moon could have functionally created a record of primordial Earth in its grayish dust. When the Rochester research team ran computer simulations of particles escaping from ancient Earth (with its weaker magnetic field and a stronger incoming solar wind) versus modern Earth (which has a much stronger magnetic field and is impacted by a weaker solar wind), they found that more particles are transferred in the modern Earth scenario. This could also mean that the Moon has more volatiles than we previously thought. Molecules trapped in grains of regolith could supply astronauts on future missions with breathable air and drinkable water, saving the weight and expense of flying them over from Earth. This research could also have implications for how Mars lost its atmosphere. The Red Planet is thought to have once had a thicker atmosphere that might have made it habitable, but most likely lost it when electric currents in its dynamo ceased moving. “Material from the present-day Earth's atmosphere can indeed account for the non-solar contributions to nitrogen and noble gas constituents in lunar soil,” said Paramanick, “offering a plausible explanation for the observed isotope ratio differences between solar and non-solar sources.” Her work has appeared in Popular Mechanics, Ars Technica, SYFY WIRE, Space.com, Live Science, Den of Geek, Forbidden Futures and Collective Tales. She lurks right outside New York City with her parrot, Lestat. When not writing, she can be found drawing, playing the piano or shapeshifting. The Moon Is Hiding Molten Goo in Its Deep Mantle</p>

Nature Electronics (2025)Cite this article Wearable human–machine interfaces could provide immersive, multisensory interactions, turning everyday items into smart haptic devices for virtual and augmented reality. However, the development of tactile wearables with kinaesthetic feedback remains limited by the size and weight of the devices, which restricts portability and comfort. Here we report a haptic ring that weighs 18 g and offers three-degrees-of-freedom force sensing and feedback. The system has an origami-inspired structural base that provides efficient and compact force transmission, and a soft force-sensing skin capable of simultaneously detecting shear and normal forces. The force-sensing skin is made by combining a topology-optimized, laser-patterned layer that has pyramid microstructures with a layer with four resistive pixels, an approach that ensures linear sensitivity and a rapid response time. The ring, which is powered by soft pneumatic actuators and integrated with inkjet-printed bending sensors, can provide kinaesthetic force feedback of up to 6.5 N.

In each pressure a) and force b) control bandwidth test, a sinusoidal setpoint signal was applied, repeated three times with the frequency doubled in each cycle. For pressure control, the setpoint frequency was swept from 0.25 Hz to 64 Hz; for force control, it was swept from 0.125 Hz to 8 Hz. a) (i) No patterns (100%), (ii) high density (62.5%), and (iii) low density (27%) bottom layers combined with top layer patterns of 1-, 100-, 400-, and 900-square arrays. R/R0 is the change in relative resistance as a function of applied force. Resistance was recorded under time-interval controlled loading; overlapping force points from repeated measurements (n=5) showed a negligible standard deviation (10−4, 0.00017 − 0.00098), so error bars are not shown. a) Resistance changes of four pixels in response to applied force on the three-axis force-sensing skin. b) Resistance change of the sensor during 10,000 cycles of repeated loading, with and without an applied normal force of 8 N. R/R0 is the change in relative resistance as a function of applied force. a) Response time for a soft touch (0.05 N) is 12 ms, b) Response time for a strong touch (40 N) is 93 ms. c) Minimum measurable force of 0.05 N (limited by the load cell). d) Resistance changes during loading and unloading cycles up to 200 N.

The sensor is fabricated by printing nanoparticle ink onto a PET layer, which is then embedded within rigid tiles. When the layer folds, the resistance of the conductive ink path changes, allowing it to function as both a sensor and a folding hinge. To mitigate drift and nonlinearity, two sensors are used in a tension-compression pair configuration, embedded in opposite base hinges of the prismatic joint. One side of each sensor is anchored, while the other side slides freely within the origami structure. This design accommodates a larger bending radius, minimizing tension-side cracks and enhancing sensor durability. Thanks to the compression-tension pair compensation approach, the resulting combined signal preserved a full-scale sensitivity and nonlinearity throughout the cyclic test despite the degradation at the individual compression and tension sensors.

Nature Synthesis (2025)Cite this article Skeletal editing via nitrogen atom insertion into cyclic frameworks is a non-conventional and powerful strategy for constructing functionalized N heterocycles—privileged scaffolds in both synthetic chemistry and pharmaceutical science. Despite their importance, general methods for the direct insertion of nitrogen into carbocycles, particularly saturated ones, remain limited due to the challenge of selectively activating of inert C–C bonds. Here we report an electrochemical platform that enables efficient nitrogen atom insertion into saturated carbocycles under mild conditions. Two distinct protocols have been developed, allowing access to either functionalized quinolines or N-alkylated saturated N heterocycles, both with excellent selectivity and broad functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies reveal the involvement of benzylic carbocation and cyclic imine intermediates, which undergo divergent pathways to furnish structurally diverse products. This methodology for N heterocycle synthesis provides a robust route to bioactive scaffolds. The synthetic utility of the approach is highlighted by the synthesis of two ion-channel antagonists.

Nature Methods (2025)Cite this article Cell migration is a key cellular process that drives major developmental programs. To mimic and mechanistically understand cell migration in these different contexts, different assays have been developed. However, owing to the lack of practical guidelines, these different cell migration assays are often used interchangeably. This and the inherent dynamic nature of cell migration, which often requires sophisticated live-cell microscopy, may have caused cell migration to be notably less well understood than equally important cell functions, such as cell differentiation or proliferation. In this Review, we describe commonly used custom and commercial in vitro and in vivo cell migration assays and provide a comprehensive practical guide and decision tree outlining how to choose and implement an assay that best suits the biological question at hand. We hope this guidance spurs biological insights into this complex process and encourages future methods development.
