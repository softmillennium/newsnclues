                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nicolai Budkov Kjaer moved to the brink of the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF semi-finals on Thursday in Jeddah, where he overcame Spaniard Rafael Jodar 4-1, 4-2, 1-4, 4-2. The Norwegian produced an impressive display to defeat Martin Landaluce in four sets in his Blue Group opener and is now 2-0 this week after resisting a mid-match fightback from Jodar in the King Abdullah Sports City. “I'm just trying to focus on winning the matches, but to be qualified [would be] cool, so I hope it happens,” said Budkov Kjaer. “I started off great… Every shot I played went in, and Rafa was probably a bit nervous, which is probably normal. I'm very happy with the win of course.” With his win, he earned a dose of Jodar revenge, having lost to the Spaniard in the 2024 US Open boys' singles final. However, even if top seed Tien wins later on Day 2, Budkov Kjaer is still very well placed to reach the last four at the 20-and-under event. Jodar, a three-time Challenger Tour champion this year, upset World No. The 19-year-old Spaniard is 1-1 this week and will meet Landaluce in his final round-robin match, still very much in contention for a semi-final berth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He is comfortable coming in, he defends incredibly well… I felt I was playing myself in a mirror.” When praise like that comes from Novak Djokovic, it tends to linger. Eighteen months later, Luciano Darderi echoed those sentiments after beating Prizmic in the quarter-finals of the ATP 250 in Umag. “I hope he's going to be Top 10 really soon,” Darderi said. “I think Croatia is in good hands.” This week in Jeddah, where Prizmic is competing at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, those endorsements remain a source of motivation rather than pressure. “It's a really good feeling, but I know that I need to work a lot, especially to be in the Top 10,” Prizmic told ATPTour.com in Jeddah. There is no pressure in that part.” Prizmic first announced himself in 2023 by lifting the Roland Garros boys' singles trophy, fulfilling a personal goal to finish his junior career with a Grand Slam title. His breakout moment soon followed under the lights of Rod Laver Arena, where he stood toe-to-toe with Djokovic on one of the sport's grandest stages. Rather than rush his return, the Croatian opted for patience, a decision that paid dividends this season. “It's really a pleasure to be here in Jeddah and to be part of this tournament. Back at full health, Prizmic rebuilt his confidence on the ATP Challenger Tour, capturing two titles in 2025. He also qualified for the US Open main draw and claimed three tour-level victories, tangible signs of progress as he continues his transition to the professional ranks. “Players have more experience now, which is normal. But I think I am adjusting to the level," said Prizmic, who went 27-9 at that level this year. "Playing the Challengers compared to juniors is different, but I think everyone can adapt.” That adaptability will be tested again this week in Jeddah. After losing to Nishesh Basavareddy in his opening match, Prizmic faces a likely must-win encounter against Justin Engel on Thursday as he looks to keep his campaign alive. Still just 20, the Croatian remains focused on steady growth rather than fast-forwarded expectations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of Poland's most recgonizable athletes, Iga Swiatek took a leap forward in shoring up the future of sport in her country by awarding five scholarships to young Polish talents through her eponymous charity foundation this week.Swiatek launched the Iga Swiatek Foundation this summer, and announced in September that it would be awarding grants of nearly half a million Polish zloty (about $140,000) to help up to five athletes ages 15 to 22 to "pursue their passions and consciously build healthy, sustainable careers. "The scholarship winners were Ignacy Andrzejczak (under-20 champion in hurdling), Wiktor Chmurski (member of the Polish junior national swim team), Liwia Kubin (multiple medalist in junior and senior speed skating), Jan Pyla (member of Poland's junior national golf team) and Oliwia Sybicka (the top-ranked under-16 tennis player in Poland).

The group will receive funding for 12 months beginning in January, and also be supported by Swiatek's personal team of advisors: physiotherapist Maciej Ryszczuk, sports psychologist Daria Abramowicz, orthopedic doctor Mateusz Dawidziuk, partnership manager Alina Sikora, and public relations and communications manager Daria Sulgostowska. "I wanted to create a program that really helps talented athletes on their way," Swiatek said according to the WTA website, after meeting the winners at Warsaw's Hotel Verte. "I wanted to create a program that really helps talented athletes on their way," Swiatek said according to the WTA website, after meeting the winners at Warsaw's Hotel Verte. The winners also took part in panel discussions with Swiatek's team, focusing on "the importance of taking a holistic approach to athletic development, how to effectively work with sponsors, and image building. "The 24-year-old's advisors know firsthand what it takes to build an athlete's brand, as evidenced by Swiatek's on- and off-court endorsement portfolio in 2025. She was the third-highest paid female athlete in the world last year according to both Sportico and Forbes, behind Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka.
