First responders tend to the scene of a reported plane crash at a regional airport in Statesville, N.C., Thursday, Dec. 18, 2025. This screengrab made from video provided by WSOC shows firefighting crews responding to a reported plane crash at a regional airport in Statesville, N.C., erupting in a large fire, Thursday, Dec. 18, 2025. STATESVILLE, N.C. (AP) — A business jet with six people aboard crashed Thursday at a regional airport in North Carolina used by NASCAR teams and Fortune 500 companies, erupting in a large fire and killing multiple people, authorities said. “I can confirm there were fatalities,” Iredell County Sheriff Darren Campbell said. There were six people on the Cessna C550 that crashed while landing at Statesville Regional Airport, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Charlotte, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The ninth hole was covered with debris. “We were like, ‘Oh my gosh! That's way too low,'” said Joshua Green of Mooresville. The plane took off from the airport shortly after 10 a.m. but then returned and was attempting to land there, according to tracking data posted by FlightAware.com. The plane had planned to fly later from Sarasota, Florida, to Treasure Cay International Airport in the Bahamas before returning to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and then to Statesville by evening, data showed. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Video from WSOC-TV showed first responders rushing onto the runway as flames burned near scattered wreckage from the plane. The airport's website states that it offers corporate aviation facilities for Fortune 500 companies and several NASCAR teams. This story corrects the sheriff's first name to Darren, not Grant.</p>

President Donald Trump attends the dignified transfer of two Iowa National Guardsmen and an interpreter killed in Syria. The civilian interpreter who was killed in Palmyra, Syria, over the weekend has been identified as Ayad Mansoor Sakat. Sakat, 54, was born in Bakhdida, Iraq, and worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army during the Iraq invasion from 2003 to 2007. President Donald Trump on Wednesday attended a dignified transfer at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware for Sakat and two Iowa National Guard soldiers killed in the attack in Syria. Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar, 25, of Des Moines, Iowa, and Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard, 29, of Marshalltown, Iowa, who were killed while supporting Operation Inherent Resolve. A U.S. Army carry team moves the transfer case containing the remains of a U.S. civilian, Ayad Mansoor Sakat, who was killed in Syria on Saturday, Dec. 13, 2025. Torres-Tovar and Howard were assigned to 1st Squadron, 113th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 34th Infantry Division of the Iowa National Guard. Edgar Torres-Tovar (right) died Saturday, Dec. 13, 2025 in Palmyra, Syria. Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said Saturday that two Army soldiers and one civilian U.S. interpreter were killed, and three were wounded when an attacker opened fire. The service members had been conducting a key leader engagement with local partners in support of ongoing counter-ISIS operations.

A Pentagon official told Fox News Digital the attack occurred in an area outside the control of interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, and that initial assessments indicate it was likely carried out by ISIS. Sakat is survived by his wife, Manahel Daau, and their children: Zeena, Leena, Dina, and Farah. Ashley Carnahan is a writer at Fox News Digital.

The Washington Commanders did not try to hide their game plan for Jaxson Dart — they wanted to "go out hitting." That's what "Hard Knocks" cameras caught head coach Dan Quinn telling his team as they prepared to face the New York Giants and the rookie sensation, who has been checked for five concussions and diagnosed with one since the preseason began. It is no secret that Dart uses his legs as a weapon, but the rookie has probably taken one too many hits. Quinn pointed out a New England Patriots linebacker's crushing blow on Dart two weeks ago in Dart's return from a concussion.

Wexler/NorthJersey.com / USA TODAY Network via Imagn Images) "This is a good hit by Christian Elliss on the sideline, all right? He is not looking to go down and get in the slide. We got to go out hitting, fellas." Dart scoffed at Quinn's comments, much as he has to other concerns about the hits he has taken this season, stating their game plan is nothing he hasn't seen before. "I mean, [Georgia coach] Kirby Smart said the exact same thing every time he played against me, so did [former Alabama coach] Nick Saban, so did every coach that I played in college,'' Dart, an Ole Miss alum, said Wednesday after practice, via SNY. This isn't like a new thing that's been brought up in my career." Washington Commanders defensive end Jacob Martin tackles New York Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart at MetLife Stadium. Commanders defensive coordinator Joe Whitt Jr. echoed Quinn's sentiments. "He will try to run the ball like a running back. He doesn't really run out of bounds. We can get the ball off of him. Dart's 55.6 completion percentage was his lowest mark of the season, but he did run nine times for 63 yards. Dart has garnered an even 400 yards on the ground on 80 carries, seven of which have resulted in touchdowns. He will surely look to add to those numbers against a stout Minnesota Vikings defense Sunday in New Jersey.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A piece of wreckage is lifted from the water onto a salvage vessel near the site in the Potomac River of a mid-air collision between an American Airlines jet and a Black Hawk helicopter, at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Feb. 4, 2025, in Arlington, Va. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis, file) National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy speaks during the NTSB fact-finding hearing on the DCA midair collision accident, at the National Transportation and Safety Board boardroom, July 30, 2025, in Washington. Attorney Bob Clifford speaks during a news conference regarding the Jan. 29, 2025, mid-air collision between American Eagle flight 5342 and a U.S. Army Black Hawk Helicopter, at the National Press Club, Sept. 24, 2025, in Washington. The U.S. government admitted Wednesday that the actions of an air traffic controller and Army helicopter pilot played a role in causing a collision last January between an airliner and a Black Hawk near the nation's capital, killing 67 people. It was the deadliest plane crash on American soil in more than two decades. The lawsuit also blamed American Airlines and its regional partner, PSA Airlines, for roles in the crash, but those airlines have filed motions to dismiss. And the government denied that any air traffic controllers or officials at the Federal Aviation Administration or Army were negligent. At least 28 bodies were pulled from the icy waters of the Potomac River after the helicopter collided with the American Airlines regional jet while it was landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport in northern Virginia, just across the river from Washington, D.C., officials said. The plane carried 60 passengers and four crew members, and three soldiers were aboard the helicopter. An American spokesman declined to comment on the filing, but in the airline's motion to dismiss, American said “plaintiffs' proper legal recourse is not against American. It is against the United States government ... The lawsuit had accused the airlines of not doing enough to mitigate the risks of flying so close to helicopters around Washington, D.C., and not adequately training their pilots to handle it. The National Transportation Safety Board will release its report on the cause of the crash early next year, but investigators have already highlighted a number of factors that contributed, including the helicopter flying 78 feet higher (24 meters) than the 200-foot (61-meter) limit on a route that allowed only scant separation between planes landing on Reagan's secondary runway and helicopters passing below. The government admitted in its filing that the United States “was on notice of certain near-miss events between its Army-operated Black Hawk helicopters and aircraft traffic transiting in and around helicopter routes 1 and 4” around Washington. Before the collision, the controller twice asked the helicopter pilots whether they had the jet in sight, and the pilots said they did and asked for visual separation approval so they could use their own eyes to maintain distance. FAA officials acknowledged at the NTSB's investigative hearings that the controllers at Reagan had become overly reliant on the use of visual separation. That's a practice the agency has since ended. Investigators have said the helicopter pilots might not have realized how high they were because the barometric altimeter they were relying on was reading 80 to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) lower than the altitude registered by the flight data recorder. The crash victims included a group of elite young figure skaters, their parents and coaches who had just attended a competition in Wichita, Kansas, and four union steamfitters from the Washington area. Levy, an aviation litigation expert witness, said the government's admission of some responsibility less than a year after the crash is unusual, especially considering the amount of money that could be involved in the case. “They would not have done that if there was a doubt in their mind about anything the controller did or that the Army did,” said Levy. Associated Press writer Audrey McAvoy contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The federal government admitted liability for the deadly plane collision in Washington earlier this year, conceding military personnel and government air traffic controllers contributed to the disaster. The January collision between an Army Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines commercial plane occurred near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, marking the deadliest plane crash on American soil in more than two decades. The helicopter pilots “failed to maintain vigilance so as to see and avoid other aircraft and their failure was a cause-infact and proximate cause of the accident,” the filing reads. Government lawyers identified an air traffic controller in the DCA tower as partially to blame, arguing the controller “negligently violated” a Federal Aviation Administration order by “failing to follow the procedures for visual separation” between the helicopter and passenger jet. Casey Crafton's widow, Rachel, alleged the U.S. government, American Airlines, and PSA Airlines, which operated Flight 5342, failed to see warning signs after more than 30 near-collisions in the area of the airport. As a result, staffing rules at the airport have been tightened. Only one air traffic controller was responsible for managing plane and helicopter traffic at the time of the crash in January. The responsibilities were combined an hour earlier in a practice called an “early shove,” which is used when air traffic is light. During a debate this summer, the NTSB also criticized the Army's failure to issue a broader advisory about the challenges faced by Black Hawk helicopters. There were known issues with the Lima model Black Hawk's barometric altimeter, which resulted in measurements varying between 70 and 100 feet.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A judge in Dedham, Massachusetts, called the acts of Brian Walshe “barbaric and incomprehensible” before sentencing him Thursday to life in prison without parole for killing his wife, dismembering her body and discarding her remains in dumpsters. The sentencing comes after a jury on Monday convicted Walshe of first-degree murder, finding he planned to kill Ana Walshe, the mother of their three children,  just hours after ringing in the new year in 2023. “The seriousness of your acts cannot be overstated. Your acts in dismembering your wife's body and disposing of her remains in multiple area dumpsters can only be described as barbaric and incomprehensible,” Judge Diane Freniere said, addressing Walshe directly in court. “You had no regard for the lifelong mental harm that your criminal acts inflicted on your then two-, four- and six-year-old sons.” Ana Walshe's sister also spoke briefly on behalf of her family, telling the judge how Ana's death “left us with an unbearable emptiness.” The sentence of life without parole for a first-degree murder conviction is required by law. Freniere also ordered Walshe to serve consecutive prison sentences for two other convictions he pleaded guilty to ahead of the trial. She ordered him to serve the statutory maximum on both of those lesser charges – up to 20 years for the count of misleading police and up to three years for the improper conveyance of a body. The sentencing represents the culmination of a case that captured national attention almost three years ago, first with the initial search for 39-year-old Ana Walshe, and then with the grisly evidence that her husband googled topics like “how to dispose of a body” and other inquiries on cleaning up blood. Before the judge imposed Walshe's sentence, defense attorney Kelli Porges said consecutive prison sentences would be inhumane and, despite what's been said in court, “He is a human. “Although I consider the letter of Diana Walshe, I simply cannot reconcile the person Diana Walshe describes in her letter with the person who stands before me for sentence,” Freniere said. Walshe, you will live with the guilt and burden of Ana Walshe's death for the rest of your life.” Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Greg Connor said the facts of the case call for a harsh penalty. Brian Walshe, 50, left a trail of evidence prosecutors used to retrace his actions to dispose of his wife's remains. Walshe then lied to investigators, claiming she had gone missing the morning of January 1, 2023, after leaving their Massachusetts home to handle a work emergency in Washington, DC, where she worked as a real estate manager and lived part time. “The church will not allow a funeral to go on. Prosecutors called about 50 witnesses over eight days, but they never offered the jury a theory of how exactly Walshe killed his wife. Instead, they worked to shed light on purported strife in the Walshes' marriage, stemming from a separate, federal criminal case against Walshe and an affair Ana was having in DC. Walshe has always maintained he had nothing to do with Ana's death. His defense team told the jury he found her dead in their bed hours into the new year, then panicked, fearing no one would believe him. Prosecutors alleged Walshe found out about his wife's monthslong affair with a man she met in Washington, DC, William Fastow, and feared losing his wife and kids to a new life she had there while he was facing the possibility of prison time and a hefty restitution bill for a federal fraud conviction. When Ana died, Walshe was still awaiting sentencing for that conviction. He had pleaded guilty to selling forged Andy Warhol artwork and was granted home confinement ahead of sentencing because he was the primary caregiver for their three kids. During the sentencing Thursday, the judge said she considered Walshe's federal conviction as she determined his punishment connected to his wife's murder. He's now serving a 37-month sentence for that federal conviction, which is set to run concurrent with his sentence in this case. Digital data recovered from Walshe's devices revealed he also googled divorce and William Fastow days before his wife's death. Over two days of deliberation, jurors asked just one question, indicating they wanted to see a photo of Ana Walshe lying on a rug in the living room of their Cohasset home that prosecutors had submitted as evidence. When investigators found pieces of the rug in garbage bags, they also found a piece of her necklace stuck in the fibers. In opening statements, defense attorney Larry Tipton told the jurors they would hear from Walshe about how he found his wife inexplicably dead in their bed. But Walshe ultimately didn't testify, and the defense rested its case without offering any evidence. While Walshe denied involvement in his wife's death, he pleaded guilty to the illegal disposal of Ana's body and misleading police – though jurors were unaware of his pleas. In closing arguments, Tipton admitted there was indeed evidence Walshe had done both. This story has been updated with additional information.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robert Floyd, Executive Secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) speaks after taking part in a meeting of the United Nations Security Council on maintenance of international peace and security Nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, March 18, 2024, at U.N. headquarters. VIENNA (AP) — In the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion earlier this year that the U.S. would resume nuclear testing, a U.S. government representative defended the stance at a global nuclear arms control meeting and pointed to nuclear provocations from Russia, China and North Korea. This process will begin immediately and proceed in a manner fully consistent with our commitment to transparency and national security,” Solomon said. Solomon provided further explanation by noting, “For any who question this decision, context is important. Since 2019, including in this forum, the United States has raised concerns that Russia and China have not adhered to the zero-yield nuclear test moratorium,” he said, adding that the concerns “remain valid.” Solomon's comment referred to so-called supercritical nuclear test explosions banned under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, known as CTBT, where fissile material is compressed to start a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction that creates an explosion. The explosive tests produce an amount of energy released, referred to as nuclear yield, which defines a weapon's destructive power. “Our concerns with Russia and China are in addition to the activities of North Korea, which has conducted six nuclear explosive tests this century,” Solomon said. The global monitoring network established alongside the treaty in 1996 to register nuclear tests worldwide has detected all of North Korea's six nuclear tests this century. However, the monitoring network is unable to detect very low-yield supercritical nuclear tests conducted underground in metal chambers, experts say. The U.S. State Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment on whether Solomon was referring to low-yield supercritical nuclear tests. China and Russia, which have signed but not ratified the treaty, say they adhere to a nuclear testing moratorium. But since 2019, the U.S. State Department has publicly expressed concerns about China and Russia not adhering to their zero-yield testing moratoria. Annual reports on compliance with arms control agreements to the U.S. Congress cite possible activities at the Lop Nur nuclear testing site in the Xinjiang region of northwestern China and Russia's Novaya Zemlya site, a remote Arctic archipelago. In an interview for “60 Minutes” that aired Nov. 2 on CBS News, Trump said, “Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it. “They don't go and tell you about it,” Trump continued. You don't necessarily know where they're testing. A White House official, asked for comment on whether Trump was referring to low-yield supercritical nuclear tests conducted underground, said the president had directed tests be done “on an equal basis” to other countries. Other countries have accelerated their testing programs and Trump wants to act accordingly, the official said without providing further details. “We consider it fundamentally important that the U.S. side provide a clear and detailed explanation of its position on the resumption of nuclear testing,” he added. “We expect the U.S. to respond appropriately and without further delay.” Ulyanov also rejected the “completely unacceptable and unsubstantiated allegations” that Russia is conducting nuclear tests. We consider such escalatory rhetoric unacceptable,” he said. Solomon refuted Ulyanov's comments, saying it is “surprising to hear such statements coming from a state that has not adhered to the zero-yield nuclear test moratorium.” Solomon then cited additional U.S. concerns, including Russia's “ongoing violations” of New START, the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between Moscow and Washington, Russia's “disproportionately large” stockpile of non-strategic nuclear weapons and Russian nuclear doctrine. The weapons referred to by Solomon generally have a lower explosive power than strategic nuclear weapons and are designed for use on the battlefield. Despite being physically smaller, experts consider nonstrategic nuclear weapons dangerous because the threshold for use is considered lower. The weapons are not covered by arms control treaties, making development easier for Russia and other states without oversight or limits. “Of particular concern is the role that nonstrategic nuclear weapons play because it may be this category of nuclear weapon that would be used first in a potential military escalation with NATO,” the report said. By contrast, strategic nuclear weapons are even more powerful and are designed to be used deep inside an enemy's territory, far away from the actual battlefield where friendly forces may be located and risk being killed. The U.S. and Russia have a comparable total number of deployed strategic nuclear weapons, with 1,718 for Moscow and 1,770 for Washington, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Trump said in October it sounded “like a good idea.” The AP is solely responsible for all content.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump Media and Technology Group Thursday announced a surprise merger with TAE Technologies, in an all-stock deal valued at more than $6 billion that would create one of the first publicly traded fusion companies. Fusion has long held the promise as a source of clean, safe, and cheap energy. And that need for energy has become more critical than ever in recent years. The combined companies plan to begin construction as soon as next year of the world's first fusion reaction that could produce electricity on utility scale, rather than just in laboratory settings. The combination with TMTG could give TAE political clout. Under terms of the deal, TMTG would provide $300 million in cash for TAE's plans. But that is likely a fraction of the cash available from some of TAE's current investors, such as Google parent company Alphabet, as well as its bevy of private equity investors. But that $300 million is only a fraction of the money that TAE needs, or expects to be able to access, once it has become a public company with this deal. Staying a private company, even with deep pocketed investors, is no longer sufficient TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer told CNN Thursday. The news comes as Trump Media's share price has plunged this year. It has announced efforts to diversify into artificial intelligence, crypto and asset management. This is by far its most diversified investment, but one that has the potential to be by far the most lucrative if it works out as planned. Trump launched Trump Media in 2021 as part of an effort to build a counterweight to Big Tech and existing social media platforms. Trump Media went public in 2024 by merging with a blank-check company in a deal that raised billions of dollars despite the company generating almost no revenue. After Trump won election last fall, he transferred his dominant stake in Trump Media to a revocable trust that he is the sole beneficiary of and that is controlled by his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. It involves fusing atoms together to create an exceptionally powerful burst of energy, achieved using the most abundant element in the universe: hydrogen. This futuristic energy is seen as something of a clean energy holy grail as it is near limitless, produces no planet-heating pollution and unlike fission — the world's current nuclear technology — it leaves no legacy of long-term nuclear waste. Countries and private companies, like TAE Technologies, are racing to master fusion, but there are huge challenges to proving the process can work and taking it from the lab to commercial use. These are very expensive ventures that rely on fundraising until they can prove fusion is successful – which is likely still years, or even decades, away. Fusion companies raised more than $2.6 billion in the first seven months of this year, according to the Fusion Industry Association, with backing coming from a wide range of investors. But it still falls far short of the amount companies say they need to bring their first pilot plants online. Although researchers have made advances in laboratories, fusion has yet to provide energy on a commercial scale. But it will still take “five-ish” years to start producing electricity, Binderbauer told CNN Thursday. “TAE has more than 25 years of R&D in the lab and safely built and operated five fusion reactors and importantly proven major energy and fusion breakthroughs over the years, putting TAE at the top of the mountain in the fusion global scene in our view,” said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities, in a note Thursday. “TAE will also clearly have major political support from President Trump in our view and this importantly will create a major nuclear fusion US energy domestic bet over the coming years,” he wrote. Nuclear power has come back into vogue in recent years as artificial intelligence creates huge new demand for electrical energy to drive computers in data centers. “It's an arms race with China,” Ives told CNN. While the US is ahead of China from an AI technology perspective, China is clearly leading on the energy front with a major surplus. If they're a US answer for fusion, it's TAE. While Trump Media and Technology Group is not profitable, it does have significant assets, especially from its crypto currency investments. But that is a paltry amount compared to the cash on hand at various other major tech companies. Binderbauer told CNN that TMTG proved to be the partner he was looking for to take the company public. And he's not concerned that any government support it needs or receives will become more politically controversial due to his ties to Trump. “I'm not looking for anything special,” he said. “Perhaps you get more scrutinized from a regulatory perspective and that's good because it will give the world confidence that the technology is what matters.” Alphabet is one of the investors in TAE already, according to data compiled by FactSet, along with Chevron, Charles Schwab, the government of Kuwait and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who passed away in 2018, as well as a number of venture capital firms. Devin Nunes, the CEO of Truth Media & Technology Group, will serve as co-CEO of the combined company with along with TAE CEO Binderbauer. “Fusion power will be the most dramatic energy breakthrough since the onset of commercial nuclear energy in the 1950s—an innovation that will lower energy prices, boost supply, ensure America's AI-supremacy, revive America's manufacturing base and bolster national defense,” Nunes told investors on a brief call Thursday morning during which neither he nor Binderbauer took any questions. “Together with TAE, we will have the capital and public market access to scale TAE's vision to put abundant nuclear energy on the grid.” This story has been updated with additional developments and context.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Justice Department has embarked on a months-long effort to prosecute people accused of assaulting federal officers while protesting President Donald Trump's immigration policies. (AP Video by Manuel Valdes, Eugene Garcia, River Zhang, Jaimie Ding, Ryan Foley, Claire Rush, Michael Biesecker and Allen Breed) WASHINGTON (AP) — The federal agent described her wounds as “boo-boos.” Body camera footage played at trial revealed that Reid had not intentionally struck the agent. It took jurors less than two hours to acquit the animal hospital worker. “It seemed like my life was just going to be taken away from me,” said Reid, who spent two days in jail and worried she would lose her new job and apartment. “It broke my heart because this is supposed to be a good and fair country and I did not see anything surrounding my case that was good or fair at all for anybody.” Reid's case was part of the Justice Department's monthslong effort to prosecute people accused of assaulting or hindering federal officers while protesting the Republican president's immigration crackdown and military deployments. Attorney General Pam Bondi has ordered prosecutors to charge those accused of assaulting officers “with the highest provable offense available under the law.” In a recent statement, Bondi pledged that offenders will face “severe consequences.” The Justice Department has struggled to deliver on that commitment, however. In examining 166 federal criminal cases brought since May against people in four Democratic-led cities at the epicenter of demonstrations, The Associated Press found: — Of the 100 people initially charged with felony assaults on federal agents, 55 saw their charges reduced to misdemeanors or dismissed outright. At least 23 pleaded guilty, most of them to reduced charges in deals with prosecutors that resulted in little or no jail time. — More than 40% of the cases involved relatively minor misdemeanor charges, a figure that appears to undermine Trump's claims that many of those accused are domestic terrorists. — All five defendants, including Reid, who went to trial so far were acquitted. — Prosecutors have successfully secured felony indictments against at least 58 people, some initially charged with misdemeanors. Those people have been accused of an assortment of assaults that include throwing rocks at federal vehicles, and punching or kicking officers. In dozens of cases, officers suffered only minor injuries, or no injuries at all, undercutting a key component of the felony assault charge that requires the potential for serious bodily harm. A misdemeanor conviction, on the other hand, typically results in no jail time or only a few weeks or months behind bars.

Randall Eliason, a former federal prosecutor and former adjunct professor at the George Washington University Law School, said Justice Department officials could be working on other cases instead of “minor, minor misdemeanors.” “Many of these cases also show how the rhetoric on Twitter and in press releases and statements is not surviving the courtroom,” he said. The Justice Department said it will continue to seek the most serious available charges against those alleged to have put federal agents in harm's way. “We will not tolerate any violence directed toward our brave law enforcement officials who are working tirelessly to keep Americans safe,” said Natalie Baldassarre, a department spokesperson. “Those who attack law enforcement will be held fully accountable for their actions, despite the best efforts of activist liberal judges who would rather see violent criminals walk free.” The assaults have occurred amid a pair of shootings targeting immigration detention facilities in Texas and the deadly attack on National Guard troops in Washington, where a former Afghan soldier who had worked for the CIA has been charged. Katherine Carreño stands for a portrait Saturday, Dec. 6, 2025, in Los Angeles. Judges have blocked the deployments in Portland and Chicago, citing a lack of credible evidence there's any organized rebellion and finding that Trump administration officials had often exaggerated or lied about threats posed by protesters. A district judge and an appeals court have gone back and forth over whether Trump must give control of the troops in California back to the state. Trump and his administration have sought to justify the military deployments, in part, by painting immigration protesters as “antifa,” which the president has sought to designate as a “domestic terrorist organization.” “President Trump will not turn a blind-eye to the sustained campaign of violence destroying American cities perpetrated by leftists and those who enable them,” said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman. Short for “anti-fascists,” antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning protesters who confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists, sometimes clashing with law enforcement. The AP found no case in which federal authorities officially accused a protester of being a “domestic terrorist” or part of an organized effort to attack federal agents. In affidavits for many of the Portland cases, federal agents referred to so-called “black bloc” protesters who wear all black clothing but did not use the word “antifa” to describe them. He has not yet been charged with a crime, court records show. Five people pleaded guilty last month to terrorism-related offenses stemming from a July 4 shooting that wounded a police officer outside an immigration detention center near Dallas. It was not included in AP's analysis because it did not occur in one of the four cities where Trump has sought to deploy troops. Federal immigration enforcement agents detain a protester in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago on Thursday, Oct. 23, 2025. The AP's analysis showed that dozens of people charged with felonies have seen their offenses reduced to misdemeanors. Among them was Dana Briggs, a 70-year-old Air Force veteran who was charged in September with assault after a protest in Chicago. In Portland, 28-year-old Lucy Shepherd was charged in November with felony assault after she batted away the arm of a federal officer who was attempting to clear a crowd outside the city's ICE facility. Prosecutors are not required to disclose why they sought to downgrade a charge, and much of that process is cloaked in secrecy. Legal experts said prosecutors typically take such action when they learn the evidence is weaker than expected or uncover facts that do not support a felony charge. Court records showed that prosecutors have secured felony indictments against people who are accused of assaulting federal officers and agents in a host of ways. In court papers, an FBI agent alleged that Martinez and the other driver were “aggressively” driving and chasing a Border Patrol vehicle. Inside Martinez's car, authorities recovered a loaded firearm, the agent wrote. It turned out Martinez legally owned the gun, and her attorneys contended that video footage — from security cameras and body cameras worn by Border Patrol officers — undermined the official narrative. The videos showed a Border Patrol agent steering his vehicle into Martinez's truck, rather than the other way around, her attorney said. “I fired 5 rounds and she had 7 holes,” read a text message that the agent, Charles Exum, sent to colleagues. “Put that in your book boys.” Twenty-four hours after the shooting, Exum texted, “Cool, I'm up for another round.” Federal prosecutors last month dismissed all charges against Martinez and the other driver. Martinez's attorney celebrated the move but emphasized that his client's “life is changed forever” due to her physical injuries, trauma and long-term impacts of being publicly branded a “domestic terrorist.” Joseph D. Fitzpatrick, an assistant U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, said prosecutors are constantly evaluating evidence to ensure “the interests of justice are served in each and every case.” Legal experts said dropping cases or reducing charges are not straightforward victories for the accused. They noted that defendants have to hire lawyers and may face significant legal expenses. They may also be held in jail for days or weeks, potentially losing jobs and seeing their families disrupted. Former federal prosecutors and defense attorneys said they were surprised that the Justice Department took at least five misdemeanor cases to trial. Such trials eat up resources, and those convicted frequently receive little jail time. The experts said they were also shocked DOJ lost all five cases at trial, a sign that the cases were particularly weak. And that's not happening,” said Ronald W. Chapman II, a defense attorney with extensive experience in the federal courts. Carreño, a paralegal, said it was one of many times she had gone to demonstrate in front of the federal complex where immigrants were being detained. An officer gave “two loud commands to move back,” which all protesters did except Carreño, the complaint alleged. She did this twice before being detained, the complaint said. Social media video shown to jurors showed an officer striding toward Carreño and pushing her back. Some jurors, pointing to the video evidence, said they disagreed. It took them just under five hours to reach their verdict — not guilty. Contact the AP's global investigative team at [email protected] or https://www.ap.org/tips/.</p>

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? This major climate target has been dead for years. For the last decade, global climate politics have revolved around a single number: 1.5 degrees Celsius. Cross it, and the risks rise sharply into uncharted territory. Climate scientists have been warning for years that we've already backed ourselves into a corner where even the most optimistic forecasts of humanity's efforts to address climate change will breach this threshold. Now this year, even some of the loudest voices calling for global action to curb emissions have begun to drop the pretense. “Scientists tell us that a temporary overshoot above 1.5 degrees [Celsius] is now inevitable,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in November. Higher average temperatures will lead to more extreme heat waves, higher sea levels, worse droughts in some areas, and more severe floods in others. To get back on track, global greenhouse gas emissions would have to fall by more than half from current levels in that timeframe, an exceedingly unlikely prospect. The United States, the world's largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, is backing away from its climate commitments and actively increasing its extraction of fossil fuels. With the window closed on staying below 1.5°C, what happens now? These years saw excruciating disasters that killed thousands and drained billions of dollars from the global economy. This is a world that has already seen sea levels rise by 9 inches on average, contributing to more frequent coastal flooding and more severe storm surges. The conditions for major wildfires are combining more often. As the planet heats up further, these events will get worse. There may also be tipping points in natural systems, where losses to ice shelves and forests reach a point where they perpetuate themselves, accelerating shifts faster than what warming alone would portend. That has huge implications for where we live, how we get our food, and our quality of life, yet despite these potentially cataclysmic shifts, there has been alarmingly little work done that actually games out the human implications of this world, according to Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a senior researcher at the Columbia University climate school. “It is becoming increasingly irresponsible to focus only on the physical modeling elements of overshooting [2.7°F/1.5°Cof warming],” Kruczkiewicz said. “We need to start thinking about what the [human] scenarios look like for a post 1.5°C world.” In a paper published in November, Kruczkiewicz and his collaborators highlighted the factors that would shape the political, economic, and humanitarian consequences of warming. For instance, while it may be possible to get back below 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit of warming after exceeding it — which some of the IPCC scenarios show that it is — we don't know whether the political will and resources even exist to make that a reality. It would take extreme measures like pulling carbon dioxide straight from the air or massive restorations of carbon-withdrawing ecosystems — an expensive proposition, especially when governments will be paying for more disasters stemming from an even warmer world. “If you are to look at the trajectory going forward,” said Sanya Carley, a climate policy researcher at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, “we clearly will be nowhere close to 1.5°C.” Bill Gates, one of the biggest donors to international climate change efforts and a major clean energy investor, said in October that while climate change is an important problem to solve, his focus is shifting toward learning to live better as temperatures rise rather than doing everything possible to stop the planet from heating up. “Unfortunately, the doomsday outlook is causing much of the climate community to focus too much on near-term emissions goals, and it's diverting resources from the most effective things we should be doing to improve life in a warming world,” Gates wrote on his website. Michael Bloomberg, the UN special climate envoy, last month announced a $100 million investment in efforts to detect and reduce emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas that's about 30 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Developing countries that contributed the least to climate change are already suffering its worst consequences, and will face even more destruction as the global temperatures climb upward. And while wealthier countries have pledged billions of dollars to help poorer nations adapt, it's a fraction of what the most vulnerable people need to cope with more severe heat waves and deadly floods. Plus, donor countries have a track record of missing funding deadlines. At the same time, political will to address climate change simply as a matter of protecting the environment is fading in many countries. Major companies are downplaying or backing away from their environmental ambitions as well. But there is some good news: Wind, solar, and battery storage systems are cropping up at a record pace around the world and are beginning to outcompete fossil fuels in many markets. The prospect of more abundant and cheaper energy to improve standards of living may be the more effective argument for curbing greenhouse gases than keeping a lid on temperatures. Humanity's ongoing efforts have already begun to bend the curve, built up unstoppable momentum, and have broken the connection between emissions and economic growth. Thankfully, some of the more extreme warming scenarios are less likely now. However, the transition to cleaner energy will still require a lot of countries and politicians working together, and that will remain a tough task — especially at the moment when countries like the US are erecting trade barriers, while others are in open war. How much further the planet will warm is a function of how many more greenhouse gases we emit, and that remains the biggest uncertainty in any climate forecast. What happens when you kill the country's climate science “mothership”? The National Center for Atmospheric Research is a treasure. Researchers say some populations are activating “jumping genes” to survive rising temperatures. And only one state in the US is mining it.</p>

A record number of recruits, many Latino, Spanish-speaking, and from border towns they know well, are heading to the agency's training academy, where more assertive tactics, including vehicle pursuit training, have been added back into the curriculum. Better weapons technology is also being introduced as part of a surge that Border Patrol leaders say reflects a broader reset under President Donald Trump's second term. After months of requests, CNN was granted rare access inside the Border Patrol Academy in Artesia, New Mexico, as a series of operational and training changes were coming into force, reflecting new priorities that academy officials said they had long wanted. The changes also come at a time when Trump is pushing hard on his promise to deport undocumented immigrants, which has seen Border Patrol officers sent to cities away from the border and drawing backlash from immigrant advocates, some state officials and Democrats on Capitol Hill. On the day CNN visited the academy in late September, hundreds of recruits lined up in their green uniforms for morning inspection, and they heard from then-acting Deputy Chief of the US Border Patrol, Scott Good, in town from DC headquarters. “You all are a tremendous part of national security. And we sincerely appreciate that you've taken the first step and that you signed up,” he told the crowd. Driving simulators are now running regularly, and vehicle pursuit training has been reintroduced and expanded both in the simulators and on the driving tracks at the sprawling 3,700-acre complex that spans two campuses. Chief Jared Ashby, who oversaw the academy during CNN's visit and has since become chief patrol agent of the Rio Grande Valley, said that's a clear change. “I believe smugglers were incentivized by our last pursuit policy. Under the Trump administration, using vehicles to make arrests has become a clear tactic. The new rules also mean several hundred agents who graduated under the Biden administration are being brought back to the academy for refresher courses, having never been trained in offensive driving under earlier guidelines, Ashby told CNN. Academy firearms instructor Agent Jeremy David described the technology as a game changer, saying graduation success rates have increased, with more recruits getting better shooting scores. Leaders of Customs and Border Protection say Trump's “big, beautiful bill” is paying for updated training procedures tied to the revised pursuit policy, expanded firing range capacity, new firearms technology, and funding to hire roughly 3,000 additional Border Patrol agents, on top of the more than 19,000 already serving nationwide. CBP data underscores how quickly that growth is happening: just over 500 trainees were enrolled on October 1, 2024; that has already doubled and the agency says it aims to have about 1,500 trainees by June 2026. Ashby said the campus is also undergoing physical upgrades to support the growing population, including additional barracks, updated fitness centers, and nutrition planning tailored to recruits' training demands. To sustain that growth, CBP has intensified recruiting efforts nationwide, targeting a broad pool of candidates. At an event outside Fort Hood, near Killeen, Texas, recruiters pitched Border Patrol as a natural next step for servicemembers preparing to leave the military. Standing under a tent, they spoke with soldiers in uniform, some accompanied by spouses and young children, outlining signing bonuses, career stability, and paid leave. Servicemembers passing by described different motivations for considering Border Patrol. About 30 recruits sat at their desks preparing to run through a simulation. When asked who was fluent in Spanish, a little more than half the class raised their hands. CBP says its most recent data shows about half of US Border Patrol agents serving along the southwest border are Hispanic or Latino. For many of these recruits, the border is not an abstract concept. In El Paso, Texas, Border Patrol is a constant presence, and residents describe the agency as deeply embedded in daily life. “We don't see people from (Ciudad Juarez) as illegals, we see them as family,” said David Villa, celebrating his 67th birthday with his grandchildren at L&J Cafe, a longtime local staple. And there are connections with Border Patrol too, residents say. “We have friends whose older siblings are in Border Patrol or are going into Border Patrol,” said Zipporah Rios, sitting in El Paso's 787 Coffee shop. Her friend Angie Prado chimed in, “I have a cousin that's in Georgia doing the training … to do Border Patrol and then come back here.” Residents distinguish between the Border Patrol they know locally and images they see elsewhere, particularly when Border Patrol agents are called to support other agents under the Department of Homeland Security. Typically, customs and immigration officers handle arrivals at official ports of entry, Border Patrol agents cover the border between those points, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) staff work in the rest of the country. “From what I have seen on social media, like in Chicago, in California, that definitely doesn't look like something our Border Patrol would be doing or how they would be behaving,” Prado said. “I don't think they've ever done that,” added Kenneth Quinonez, seemingly surprised by the images showing clashes between Border Patrol and migrants they're apprehending in other parts of the country. But elsewhere in El Paso, fear is shaping daily life for some. One family with mixed immigration statuses, is largely staying inside their home, even as they confront a medical crisis. The father has a rare and aggressive form of cancer. It's super rare, very rare form of cancer,” his daughter said, asking we not use her or her family's names for fear of being reported to immigration officials. She said fear kept him from seeking treatment sooner. “The only thing that he's receiving right now is medication management for pain, but there's no more hope for him … He's basically dying before our eyes.” The family said they are trying to hold onto a sense of shared humanity, including for those who may have been tasked with removing them. Border Patrol agents say their mission centers on national security but also includes humanitarian efforts. CBP points to its rescue and mortality data and specialized units like BORSTAR, which conduct search and rescue operations in dangerous terrain, as examples of how enforcement can also involve saving lives. “But you have to do what you have to do for your family at the end of the day.” Agent Claudio Herrera patrols the El Paso sector. Born and raised in Mexico, he says he first came to the US as a student on an F1 visa and later became a citizen. Herrera said he believes enforcement and empathy are not mutually exclusive. “My deepest advice to anybody that is coming from Mexico,” he said.

Yet it's still shaping up to be one of the industry's worst years ever. Until October, bitcoin had been riding high, hitting a peak of $126,000 — up more than 30% since January. Institutional adoption has surged, bringing in billions through bitcoin exchange-traded funds. And still, crypto can't seem to find its footing. After holding somewhat steady around the $90,000 level in recent weeks, another steep selloff sent bitcoin tumbling to around $86,000 on Wednesday. If Team Crypto is looking to point its finger for this bear market, it might consider a mirror. There are technical reasons for the slump, most notably an extreme buildup of leveraged positions — speculative bets that can turbocharge gains but come with extreme downside risks — that were liquidated in an early October flash crash. But the protracted slump appears to be about more than just a hangover from that crash. So why are investors shunning this particular flavor of risk? One explanation is that crypto culture has refused to grow up, and it's keeping would-be investors on the sidelines. Looking back on a year when crypto advocates got everything they could have dreamed of from a legal and regulatory standpoint, the industry still hasn't figured out what to do with its problem children — the scammers, thieves and internet trolls who haven't gotten the memo that crypto is trying to clean up its act. Over the summer, memecoin pushers claimed responsibility for an orchestrated effort to throw dildos onto the court during WNBA games, claiming it was an effort to “make memes funny again.” Then there are the garden variety scammers, who find in crypto a means to separate people from their money via crypto ATM schemes — an epidemic that has cost Americans more than $330 million this year. There have been more than 30 of those so-called “wrench attacks” this year, according to industry researcher Chainalysis, though it notes many of the crimes go unreported. One of those attacks made national news over the summer, when a 28-year-old crypto investor escaped from a luxury Manhattan apartment, accusing two men of holding him captive for weeks while he was beaten and threatened with death. None of that means crypto investing is wrong, per se, but it's certainly not reassuring, particularly for those who may have bought bitcoin near the peak just a few months ago and are now sitting on giant losses. “Retail investors are teetering between their fear of missing out on a juicy investment and concerns about the unsavory aspects of crypto and its promoters,” Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad told me. “Such investors will invariably amplify the volatility of crypto prices in both directions, and I think that's what we are seeing right now.” Bitcoin's rally, sparked by President Donald Trump's re-election, attracted new investors to crypto who cared more about the number going up than the cultural or political associations. But when the financial upside began to sour, Prasad said, there wasn't a lot keeping investors in the market.

President Donald Trump's newly released National Security Strategy breaks the mold of White House strategy documents being a product of an elite policy consensus. Conveniently, we now have a clear picture of what the American people actually think when it comes to our most pressing national security challenges. Our Reagan National Defense Survey, released just days before the strategy, offers one of the clearest assessments of public attitudes toward national defense, foreign policy, allies and adversaries. Together, the strategy and the survey reveal a story of both striking alignment and meaningful misalignment — a mixed bag that says as much about America's evolving worldview as it does about the administration's. The strategy elevates "peace through strength" as a core principle, declaring that America must sustain "the world's most powerful, lethal, and technologically advanced military" to deter adversaries and maintain global stability. The strategy calls for a "Golden Dome," a next-generation missile-defense shield for the homeland and a "Golden Fleet" to counter China's massive advantage in naval shipbuilding. Sixty-eight percent support major new investments to build the Golden Dome system, and when told China can produce more than 200 ships for every one U.S. ship, an astonishing 88% say the United States needs more manufacturing capacity — with 62% saying it needs a lot more. The public is not only receptive to rebuilding American military power; it is demanding it. The strategy and polling are well-aligned on China. The NSS devotes more attention to the People's Republic of China than to any other competitor, describing how "American elites—over four successive administrations of both political parties—were either willing enablers of China's strategy or in denial." President Trump seeks to "rebalance" the U.S. economic relationship with Beijing, counter its military buildup and deter attempts to dominate strategic supply chains, framing — though not naming — China as the defining threat of this century. Forty-eight percent identify China as the greatest threat to the United States — outpacing Russia two-to-one — and large majorities support forward deterrence in the Indo-Pacific, including moving U.S. military assets to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack. They want the United States to compete — and win. But, the places of divergence are just as revealing. For all its clarity on China, the strategy takes a more restrained tone when describing America's allies, especially in Europe. It questions Europe's economic vitality, strategic reliability and even its "civilizational self-confidence," suggesting the continent may not be a dependable partner in the long run. When it comes to Russia, the strategy is relatively muted, prioritizing "strategic stability" in the U.S.-Russia relationship despite Russia's war against Ukraine and actions against NATO. The American people, by contrast, are extraordinarily clear-eyed about who is a friend and who is a foe. Survey respondents overwhelmingly favor restricting the sale of advanced semiconductors to China, with 65% supporting strict limits to prevent Beijing from gaining military or strategic advantages. Yet the Trump administration's strategy opens the door to continued chip sales — prioritizing dollar flows and commercial reciprocity over maintaining America's long-term technological edge. Americans are not confused, conflicted or ambivalent about where the threats lie. They see the world for what it is. The same clarity appears in attitudes toward international engagement. Sixty-four percent say the United States should be more engaged and take the lead internationally — not retreat or stand back — while only 33% prefer a less engaged approach. This is not a public demanding isolation; it is a public demanding leadership grounded in purpose and realism. They want America to avoid endless wars, but, they also want an American-led global order. Sixty-eight percent of the public have a favorable view of NATO, and 76% support defending a NATO ally if attacked. Even among those who initially express support for U.S. withdrawal, large majorities reconsider when told that NATO allies have committed to raising their defense spending to 5% of GDP — a credit to President Trump's leadership on the issue. Americans agree with the strategy when it comes to fairness and burden-sharing, but they also understand that alliances are strategic assets — not liabilities. The Middle East also reveals another disconnect. The strategy argues that the region should no longer dominate U.S. foreign policy, noting its declining importance to American economic security due to rising U.S. energy production. Yet Americans remain deeply attentive to the region's threats. Majorities support preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, favor providing military assistance to Israel under certain circumstances, and remain wary of terrorism and instability emanating from the region. Americans understand if we take our eye off the Middle East, we do so at our own risk. Taken together, the Reagan survey reveals something profound. They are realists — clear-eyed about adversaries, supportive of our allies, committed to deterrence and overwhelmingly united around the principle that American strength is essential for global peace. President Trump's National Security Strategy captures these instincts by prioritizing developing unrivaled military power, industrial revitalization and strategic competition with China. But, its skepticism toward European allies, its relative quiet regarding Russia and its approach to the Middle East diverge from where the American people actually stand. In the United States, national security strategies often garner little attention outside of Washington, D.C. But, allied capitals and adversaries from Beijing to Moscow read the NSS carefully and take it seriously. Americans know who their friends are, who their enemies are and what it takes to keep the country safe. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

President Donald Trump announced a series of celebrations for the 250th anniversary of the U.S. next year in a video shared to social media Thursday, saying, "We're going to have a good time." FIRST ON FOX: President Donald Trump is kicking off America's monthslong birthday bash celebrating the 250th anniversary of the country's founding with a new nonpartisan organization dubbed Freedom 250 that will lead the administration's celebrations, Fox Digital learned. The year "2026 will mark a celebration of America unlike anything we have ever done, and I am grateful to President Trump for the opportunity to execute his vision for Freedom 250," Keith Krach, former undersecretary of state under the first Trump administration, who was named CEO of Freedom 250, said in a press release of the new organization. Freedom 250 is a new public-private partnership to unveil patriotic events nationwide in honor of America's 250th birthday on July 4, 2026. "This means so much to him personally, as it does to every single American," Ambassador Monica Crowley told "Fox & Friends" on Thursday. "Some of us might remember 1976 and the bicentennial. "And so, what we are planning with Freedom 250 is this massive monumental celebration that President Trump promised back in his first term, a celebration that really creates that feeling of a renewal of pride and patriotism." Trump shared a video message on Thursday morning announcing the initiative, as well as previewing a handful of high-profile events celebrating the milestone. "To help carry out these exciting plans, we have created a new public-private partnership. This will be a time like you've never had in your lives, America 250. Trump touted that Americans will "never see anything like it, and you'll ever see anything like it again" of the line-up of events. "As we ring in 2026, Americans across the nation will see the iconic Washington Monument illuminated with festive birthday lights to honor the start of this historic anniversary year. Then from June 25th to July 10th of next year, we will host the Great American State Fair on the National Mall, featuring pavilions from all 50 states, highlighting breathtaking innovations and celebrating America's exceptional history and culture," Trump said. The line-up will include the first "Patriot Games," Trump said, which is a four-day athletic event "featuring the greatest high school athletes, one young man and one young woman from each state and territory." "But I promise there will be no men playing in women's sports. You'll see everything but that," he quipped. The website touting the year of celebrations includes engaging Americans with videos crafted in part by Hillsdale College, which tell "the remarkable story of American independence." President Donald Trump is seen here at the America250 rally in Des Moines, Iowa. Trump has been eyeing the 250th birthday for years and pledged on the 2024 campaign trail to celebrate it in grand fashion. "The president promised in his first term, and going into this term, even as a candidate, the most monumental celebration of America for our big 250th birthday, and through Freedom 250 and so many other elements, he is delivering on these promises," Crowley told "Fox & Friends." "As a nation, we should be preparing for the most spectacular birthday party. We want to make it the best of all time," Trump said in a 2023 campaign video. The new website also offers "toolkits" showing Americans how to mark the milestone in their own communities, including a toolkit for teachers, one for state fairs and another tailored to rodeos. Another section highlights America's natural beauty, 250 years of innovation and how many Americans say the nation's fabric has been woven with prayer and faith. The nation already has held a series of events tied to the 250th milestone, including a June 14 military parade Trump hosted in Washington, D.C., for the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary. The parade fell on Flag Day, which also marked Trump's 79th birthday. Among the lengthy list of upcoming events celebrating the anniversary is the highly anticipated White House UFC fight, which first daughter Ivanka Trump is helping facilitate, Fox News Digital previously reported. President Donald Trump salutes passing troops during a parade to honor the Army's 250th anniversary on June 14, 2025, in Washington. Trump revealed in his video message on Thursday that the UFC fight will be held on Flag Day, June 14. "And on Flag Day, We will have a one-of-a-kind UFC event here at the White House. The great Dana White is hosting, and it's gonna be something special. But all of this is just the beginning," Trump said. Rosie Rios, chair of America250, added that the "creation of Freedom 250 will be instrumental in providing Task Force 250 with a clear funding mechanism to advance its Presidential initiatives." "As the national organization charged by Congress to represent all three branches of government in planning the nation's 250th anniversary, America250's goal is to engage all 350 million Americans ("350 for 250")," Rios said. "America250 will continue to focus on the values-based programming approved by our bipartisan Commission at the local, state, national and international levels, including once-in-a-lifetime celebratory moments during the 4th of July weekend. In 2025 alone, Trump created a White House Task Force 250 by executive order, revived his 1776 Commission as a patriotic-education partner, and signed the massive "big beautiful bill" that steers tens of millions into initiatives focused on the birthday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israeli officials are investigating the killing of Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Nuno F.G. Loureiro, according to a Jerusalem Post report. Loureiro, who was originally from Portugal, taught at MIT as a professor of physics and of nuclear science and engineering. He also directed the university's Plasma Science and Fusion Center. A professor of engineering at MIT, Dennis Whyte, who also previously served as the director of the Plasma Science and Fusion Center, told MIT News that Loureiro was a “brilliant” scientist and person. “He shone a bright light as a mentor, friend, teacher, colleague, and leader, and was universally admired for his articulate, compassionate manner. In statements on Wednesday, local officials advised following updates from the Brookline Police Department and the Norfolk District Attorney's Office, as it is an open homicide investigation. “This remains an active and ongoing homicide investigation. While we investigate this incident, we will have dedicated patrol cars, officers, and unmarked units in the Gibbs Street neighborhood,” Brookline Police Chief Jennifer Paster said. “We understand that, in the absence of concrete information, rumors and fear can spread among community members,” Greene said in a statement. “We also understand your frustration with what we can say at the present time, but respectfully ask that law enforcement be given the space it needs to bring the perpetrator of this crime to justice, and that the victim's loved ones be given privacy and shelter from rumors or misinformation.” The shooting occurred days after a gunman opened fire at Brown University, killing two students.</p>
