                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday directing federal agencies to reclassify marijuana, loosening long-standing restrictions on the drug and marking the most consequential shift in U.S. cannabis policy in more than half a century. The order, once finalized by the Drug Enforcement Administration, moves cannabis out of Schedule I classification — the most restrictive category under the Controlled Substances Act, alongside heroin and LSD — to a Schedule III classification, which encompasses substances with accepted medical use and a lower potential for abuse, such as ketamine and Tylenol with codeine. "This action has been requested by American patients suffering from extreme pain, incurable diseases, aggressive cancers, seizure disorders, neurological problems and more, including numerous veterans with service related injuries, and older Americans who live with chronic medical problems that severely degrade their quality of life," Trump said from the Oval Office Thursday. Also on Thursday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, led by Dr. Mehmet Oz, is expected to launch a pilot program in April enabling certain Medicare-covered seniors to receive free, doctor-recommended CBD products, which must comply with all local and state laws on quality and safety, according to senior White House officials. The products must also come from a legally compliant source and undergo third-party testing for CBD levels and contaminants. Shares of cannabis conglomerates were mixed following the announcement. Shares of Tilray Brands were up about 6% while shares of Trulieve sank roughly 15% and Green Thumb Industries fell around 5% in afternoon trading. The AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF, which tracks American operators, fell more than 10%. The move exempts companies from IRS Code Section 280E, allowing them to deduct standard expenses like rent and payroll for the first time. It also opens the door for banking access and institutional capital previously sidelined by compliance fears. While CBD has surged in popularity in recent years, with infused consumer goods ranging from seltzers to skincare, the FDA has stopped short of granting the compound its full backing. Studies have found "inconsistent benefits" for targeted conditions, while FDA-funded research warns that prolonged CBD use can cause liver toxicity and interfere with other life-saving medications. Currently, the FDA has only approved one CBD-based, Epidiolex, for rare forms of epilepsy. "I want to emphasize that the order ... doesn't legalize marijuana in any way, shape or form, and in no way sanctions its use as a recreational drug," Trump said. Experts and industry insiders told CNBC this week that a reclassification could pave the way for more research into the effects of CBD use.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The prestigious Washington, D.C., cultural center's board of trustees, who were appointed by President Donald Trump in February, "have just voted unanimously" on the name change, Leavitt said in an X post. They did so "because of the unbelievable work President Trump has done over the last year in saving the building," Leavitt said. "Congratulations to President Donald J. Trump, and likewise, congratulations to President Kennedy, because this will be a truly great team long into the future! The building will no doubt attain new levels of success and grandeur," she said. Leavitt's depiction of a center that has been saved "not only from the standpoint of its reconstruction, but also financially, and its reputation" contrasts with reporting from multiple news outlets that ticket sales and staffing both have sharply declined this year. The New York Times reported last month that internal figures showed ticket sales during a typical week in October down by about 50% from the same period a year earlier. The Washington Post, which analyzed sales data from early September through Oct. 19, found an "across-the-board drop-off" in ticket sales for the center's three largest performance spaces. Trump, who named himself chairman of the Kennedy Center weeks after taking office, signaled in October that the name change was forthcoming. In a Truth Social post, Trump shared pictures of a newly painted colonnade on the outside of the building below a caption praising "the new TRUMP KENNEDY, whoops, I mean, KENNEDY CENTER, columns." The center was not initially named after Kennedy. It was created in 1958, when President Dwight Eisenhower signed legislation to "provide for a National Cultural Center" in Washington. In 1962, Eisenhower's successor, Kennedy, and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy led a $30 million fundraising campaign to build the center. Two months later, President Lyndon Johnson signed a law renaming the center in honor of the slain president. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nike is expected to report earnings after the bell Thursday as Wall Street eyes the company's progress in reigniting its business. The sneaker company is just over a year into CEO Elliott Hill's turnaround strategy, focusing on regaining its growth and market share, clearing out old inventory and investing in wholesale relationships. Here's what analysts are expecting for Nike's second fiscal quarter of 2026, according to consensus estimates from LSEG: The company is set to hold a conference call with investors at 5 p.m. ET as analysts look for a read on holiday demand. Nike's stock has dropped more than 11% this year. But Hill noted that other areas, like its China segment and direct business, have not been performing as well. Nike expects those headwinds to continue into the new year. Hill told CNBC in October that the company's turnaround plan is showing progress, but it will "take a while" to return to profitable growth. The sneaker giant has also been taking a hit from tariffs. In September, the company said it expected tariffs to cost it $1.5 billion and impact its gross margin by 1.2 percentage points in its current fiscal 2026. The company previously said it expected its gross margin for its second quarter to fall between 3 and 3.75 percentage points. Hill called the shake-up a move "about growth and offense." "Collectively, these changes amount to us eliminating layers and better positioning Nike to continue to have an impact the way only Nike can," Hill said in a statement at the time. The company also has reported a strong start in its NikeSKIMS partnership with Kim Kardashian's shapewear brand, which Hill previously said has seen a "very strong" response.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The VC arms of Alphabet and Nvidia have invested in Swedish vibe coding startup Lovable's $330 million Series B at a $6.6 billion valuation, the company announced on Thursday. The news confirms an earlier story from CNBC, which reported on Tuesday that Lovable had raised at that valuation, trebling its valuation from its previous round in July, and that the investors included U.S. VC firms Accel and Khosla Ventures. CapitalG, one of Alphabet's VC divisions, and Menlo Ventures led the round. The fresh funds take Lovable's total raised in 2025 to over $500 million. "Lovable has done something rare: built a product that enterprises and founders both love," said Laela Sturdy, managing partner at CapitalG in a statement accompanying the announcement. "The demand we're seeing from Fortune 500 companies signals a fundamental shift in how software gets built." Lovable's platform uses AI models from providers like OpenAI and Anthropic to help users build apps and websites using text prompts, without technical knowledge of coding. The startup reported $200 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in November, just under a year after achieving $1 million in ARR for the first time. It was founded in 2023 by Anton Osika and Fabian Hedin. Vibe coding startups have seen big interest from VCs in recent times, as investors bet on their promise of drastically reducing the time it takes to create software and apps. In the U.S., Anysphere, which created coding tool Cursor, raised $2.3 billion at a $29.3 billion valuation in November. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Micron Technology's stock jumped 12% after the company signaled robust demand for its memory chips and blew away fiscal first-quarter estimates. During an earnings call with analysts, Micron, which makes memory storage used for computers and artificial intelligence servers, said data center needs have fueled greater demand for its products. Micron said it expects the total addressable market for high-bandwidth memory to hit $100 billion by 2028, growing at a 40% compounded annual growth rate. "We are more than sold out," said business chief Sumit Sadana. "We have a significant amount of unmet demand in our models and this is just consistent with an environment where the demand is substantially higher than supply for the foreseeable future. Micron topped Wall Street estimates for the fiscal first quarter and issued blowout guidance. The company reported adjusted earnings of $4.78 per share on $13.64 billion in revenue, surpassing LSEG estimates for earnings of $3.95 per share and $12.84 billion in sales. Revenues in the current quarter are expected to hit about $18.70 billion, blowing past the $14.20 billion expected by LSEG. Adjusted earnings are forecast to reach $8.42, versus expectations of $4.78 per share. JPMorgan upped its price target on the stock following the results, citing the favorable pricing setup, while Bank of America upgraded shares to a buy rating. "If AI keeps growing as we expect, we believe that the next 12 months are going to have broader coat tails to the AI trade than just the processor names and memory would be the biggest beneficiary," analysts wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of Russia's last remaining allies in the European Union told CNBC he believes there is no way forward for proposals to fund the rebuilding of Ukraine via frozen Russian assets. The European Commission – the EU's executive arm – is considering using seized Russian assets held in Europe to provide further financial support to Ukraine. Speaking to CNBC as officials arrived at a European Council meeting, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said proposals to use the immobilized assets as a means to assist Ukraine had been "killed." "There is no sufficient level of support behind it." Orbán is widely seen as Russia's closest ally within the EU, and has been a vocal critic of plans to use potentially hundreds of billions of euros of frozen assets to fund reparations loans for Kyiv. Hungary isn't alone in having doubts over the measures, however. Belgium, whose support is critical given that huge amounts of frozen assets lie in the Brussels-based clearing house Euroclear, has expressed concern over possible legal and financial risks. Italy and Bulgaria have also supported Belgium's resistance to the proposals. For its part, the Kremlin has said such a move would be tantamount to justification for war, and Russia's central bank announced last week it was suing Euroclear in a Moscow court "for recovery of losses caused to the Bank of Russia." The European Council meeting, due to conclude Friday, will have funding options for reparations loans to Ukraine high on the agenda. "Without new additional financial support from the EU and other international donors, Ukraine is expected to run out of funds early in 2026," the European Parliament said in a briefing Wednesday, adding that Hungary had already blocked the option to use the headroom in the EU budget to provide funding to Kyiv. Decisions on use of the EU's own finances require a unanimous vote from all 27 member states to be passed. Asked ahead of Thursday's meetings if he was acting in Europe's or Russia's interests by working to block the use of Russian assets by the EU, Orbán said he was "just working for peace." Russian and Ukrainian forces are entering their fourth winter of fighting as peace talks drag on. Negotiations are expected to continue into this coming weekend, possibly in Miami, following weeks of talks between delegations from the U.S., Russia, Ukraine and Europe. Despite Orbán's take on the subject, Kaja Kallas, EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, told reporters in Brussels on Thursday that the bloc was pushing for peace alongside Ukraine, but that it was "one sided." "We haven't seen any willingness from the Russian side to move or seriously talk about peace," she said. Unlike Orbán, she struck an optimistic tone on pushing the proposals around the reparations loan and frozen assets through. "The issues that Belgium has raised have been addressed, so I hope we get this over the finishing line. Putin is banking on us to fail, so we shouldn't give him that." We want to hear from you.

Nearly two decades ago, tech startups used to chase the distinct pedigree of being a unicorn — reaching a $1 billion valuation. It is a small but growing club, and you must be valued at more than $100 billion to qualify. The autonomous automaker is in talks to raise billions in a new round of funding that could send its value soaring past $100 billion, multiple outlets reported on Wednesday. Here are seven startups that have already reached hectocorn status. After launching in 2022, the AI-powered chatbot attracted hundreds of millions of weekly users, cementing OpenAI's position as a leader in the AI race. CEO Sam Altman cofounded OpenAI alongside eleven others in 2015. The Information reported on Wednesday that it is seeking to raise many billions more at a gobsmacking $750 billion valuation. Tesla CEO Elon Musk expanded his business portfolio in 2002 when he founded SpaceX, an aerospace startup based in Texas that has completed over 320 launches. The core mission for SpaceX is to make humanity multi-planetary. SpaceX was the most valuable private company in the world, with a $400 billion valuation, before OpenAI surpassed it in October. SpaceX, however, is planning its own secondary share sale, which would value it at a whopping $800 billion. The startup is also exploring an initial public offering in 2026, at a potential valuation of $1.5 trillion. Anthropic's main product is Claude, a family of large language models that power an eponymous AI chatbot. Anthropic has received major investments from tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, as well as the pick-and-shovel company of the AI rush, chipmaker Nvidia. ByteDance, based in China, gained widespread recognition through its popular social media app, TikTok. Although the startup introduced the app to Chinese users in 2016, it later launched an international version a year later. Zhang Yiming founded ByteDance in 2012, and its current CEO is Liang Rubo. In August, ByteDance valued itself at $330 billion as it explored a share buyback program for employees. Fidelity, an early investor in ByteDance, has valued the company even higher, at $380 billion. Databricks is a software and AI startup founded in 2013. It is led by cofounder Ali Ghodsi, who serves as CEO. Databricks offers enterprises its Data Intelligence Platform, which manages and implements cloud infrastructure. The startup says it uses generative AI to understand an enterprise's data, then "it automatically optimizes performance and manages infrastructure to match your business needs." xAI is Elon Musk's newest business venture, founded in 2023. The startup develops AI tools, including Grok, a large language model that powers a chatbot of the same name. Musk has implemented the technology across his companies, including X and Tesla. Reports in November 2024 valued the startup at $50 billion. That number rose in March to $80 billion after xAI acquired X, the social media company formerly known as Twitter that Musk purchased in 2022. At the time, Musk said X was valued at $33 billion, so the two startups reached a combined valuation of $113 billion. Musk, however, denied those reports at the time.</p>

California startup Natilus announced Wednesday that Indian carrier SpiceJet will order up to 100 of its new airliner called Horizon. Company CEO Aleksey Matyushev said in a press release that India's growing aviation sector will be short about 2,200 aircraft by 2040 and believes his next-generation BWB could help fill that demand. India is the world's fifth-largest aviation market with about 211 million passengers in 2024 — an increase of about 11% year-over-year, according to the global airline trade association IATA.

Natilus also plans to source manufactured parts from India and has established a subsidiary called Natilus India, headquartered in Mumbai, to support its operations. This is the first publicly announced international airline order for Horizon, but Natilus told Business Insider that its commercial order book — which also includes its BWB cargo version, Kona — stands at more than 570 orders valued at $25 billion following SpiceJet's order. Kona has purchase agreements with carriers like US operator Ameriflight, a partner of FedEx, DHL, and UPS, as well as Canadian airline Norolinor. However, it's unclear if Horizon has other buyers besides SpiceJet. Horizon would bring a new type of aircraft to India's skies that promises better operating economics than those offered by the reigning Boeing-Airbus duopoly. Matyushev previously told Business Insider that Horizon will offer improved efficiency because its wing design generates lift across a much larger surface area, cutting fuel burn by roughly 30% and operating costs by about 50% compared with similarly sized aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320. The plane, which could carry up to 240 people in a high-capacity configuration, would also fit into existing airport infrastructure and offer about 40% more cabin space thanks to its wider footprint. Renderings of Horizon published in July show a futuristic business class, up to three aisles between rows of a dozen economy seats, and dedicated privacy pods. Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury recently said that it sees BWB planes as the future of aviation. This means passengers could face minimal natural light, disorientation, and claustrophobia. He has previously said Horizon would meet and exceed safety standards. Sub-scale demonstrators have flown, but no full-sized BWB has been certified for commercial use. With a team of employees who have worked for companies like Northrop Grumman and SpaceX, Natilus is betting Horizon can break into the fiercely competitive commercial aircraft market. Airbus has been experimenting with commercial BWB aircraft since 2017 as part of its ZEROe program, which aims to build zero-emission airliners that run on hydrogen instead of traditional jet fuel. Another California startup, JetZero, is developing a 250-person BWB, called the "Z4," that is expected to launch in the early 2030s and offer up to 50% lower fuel burn. Managing director Andrew Chang previously described JetZero to Business Insider as a "living room in the sky."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Human trafficking, which generates an estimated $450 billion annually, is reportedly being driven by a fiscal engine prevalent in the West African market. While this has ensured the preservation of a considerable portion of the labor force, it has regrettably also engendered certain illegal activities. One such activity is the deeply reprehensible and largely uncontrollable human trafficking industry, an illicit operation that continues to thrive despite international efforts to curb its reach and dismantle its networks. During a recent event in Lagos on Wednesday, concerning statistics and findings were disclosed, emphasizing the significant role of the informal sector in West Africa regarding human trafficking. According to estimates, traffickers hold 49.6 million people in modern slavery globally, including 12 million children, and the illicit sector made billions of dollars from forced commercial sexual exploitation as of 2024 (ILO and United Nations, 2024). At the opening ceremony of the GIABA-ECOWAS Gender Development Centre Regional Forum on Women and Transnational Organised Crime: Human Trafficking Risks in West Africa, GIABA Director-General Edwin Harris stated that human trafficking is widespread in the regional bloc. Represented by the Acting Director of Policy and Research, Dr Jeffery Isima, the director general stated; West Africa is a region where trafficking is most prevalent. So, again, West Africa has a lot of problems. Traffickers do not only exploit the people's resources. They also exploit our weak financial systems.” He then went on to explain how the informal market bolsters this illicit activity, as seen in the Punch newspaper. Normally, if you want to buy a car, for example, you should go to the bank or issue a cheque or pay with a bank card, but people prefer to take cash. Informality and cash transactions facilitate money laundering and other financial crimes because it is difficult to combat crime in such an environment. What we are doing to deal with it is to, first of all, help the Nigerian government to enhance financial inclusion and the cashless policy to make it take good effect so that people can do transactions, do huge or massive transactions through electronic payments, which are easier to trace if anything goes wrong,” he relayed further. The DG further noted that although women and children constitute a substantial share of human trafficking victims globally, they are also, in some instances, involved as active participants in the perpetuation of this inhumane trade. Not only that, but they also participate. They convince the young, poor girls in rural communities. In Europe, she acts as a mother who receives them. She provides the hostels for their lodging and prostitution. GIABA National Correspondent and Director-General of the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit, Hafsat Bakari, represented by Mrs. Biola Shotunde, also elaborated on the subject. “According to ILO and UNODC estimates, post-slavery trafficking generates over $450bn U.S. dollars annually. This is a huge and worrisome issue. Placing it among the top revenue-generating criminal activities in the world, women and girls account for over 60 per cent of the identified victims globally, with sexual exploitation and domestic savagery particularly prevalent in our region.

For this reason, trafficking cannot be effectively tackled without integrating anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism tools into our national and regional crime systems,” she added.
