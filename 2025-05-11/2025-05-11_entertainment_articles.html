Lennie James took home Best Leading Actor in a highly competitive category. His prize for Mr Loverman, the BBC adaptation of Bernardine Evaristo‘s seventh novel, meant the likes of Richard Gadd and Gary Oldman missed out. Ariyon Bakare won Best Supporting Actor for his turn in Mr Loverman. In an emotional speech, she thanked Mickey Down and Konrad Kay for changing her life. Showrunner Justin Marks appeared to reference Donald Trump‘s tariff plan in his acceptance speech, saying “good television is truly a borderless nation.” Danny Dyer was the popular winner of Best Male Performance In A Comedy. The former Football Factory actor has garnered plaudits for his work in Disney+ series Rivals, but took home the BAFTA prize for Sky's Mr Big Stuff. Ruth Jones won Best Female Performance In A Comedy after the wildly popular festive finale of Gavin & Stacey. BAFTA handed out television prizes for its Craft Awards last month, during which winners included Baby Reindeer creator Gadd, who took home the award for Writer: Drama.

A benefit of being Tom Cruise must be that whenever he wants something to happen, he's probably able to make it happen. Speaking for an interview featured in the June issue of Sight and Sound (per The Independent), the “Mission: Impossible” star recalled traveling to England to meet Kubrick for the first time and pitching Kidman for “Eyes Wide Shut” then and there. I knew all of his films,” Cruise said. “Then it was basically he and I getting to know each other. And when we were doing that, I suggested Nicole play the role [of Alice].

She believed it was her “boldness” that made her the right fit for Alice: the wife to Cruise's New York doctor, both of whom arrive in the film under-stimulated by their somewhat tepid marriage. “I suppose that was why he cast me. ‘This is how I take off the dress, Stanley.'

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Refresh for latest…: Marvel Studios/Disney's Thunderbolts* has reached $272.2M worldwide in its sophomore session. The current international box office cume is $143.7M after this frame added $34M overseas. Before we dive into more detail on Thunderbolts* second go-round, let's dig into some new milestones for Warner Bros/Legendary's A Minecraft Movie. It also passed half a billion internationally, now at $500.6M. 'Thunderbolts*' Simmers $33M 2nd Frame; 'Sinners' Strong $21M 4th Weekend; Making Sense Of Single Digit Bows 'Clown', 'Shadow Force' & 'Fight Or Flight' - Box Office Update 'X-Men' Movie At Marvel Studios Circling 'Thunderbolts*' Director Jake Schreier To Assemble New Team - The Dish Turning back to Thunderbolts*, it was the top MPA picture in most of Europe. 2 studio title of the year in Hong Kong, Indonesia, India and Thailand. Some of the strongest holds this weekend include in Ukraine (-21%), Poland (-24%), Denmark (-26%), Sweden (-28%), Spain (-31%), France (-31%), Australia (-34%), Germany (-37%) and Hong Kong (-37%). The Top 5 markets to date are: UK ($15.5M), China ($13.8M), Mexico ($11.2M), France ($7.2M) and Australia ($6.4M). The global Imax cume is $29M, including $15M from overseas. As for Minecraft, this weekend added $12.5M in 78 offshore markets, helping push the Chicken Jockey across a bunch of new records. It's now the biggest WB movie ever in Poland, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Lebanon and Turkey. Globally, Minecraft has exceeded such other WB titles as Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, The Chamber of Secrets, and The Prisoner of Azkaban, as well as Batman V.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dock workers and truckers who are out of work or worried about their jobs because China‘s trade with the U.S. is coming to a grinding halt “should be very optimistic and positive, because the president truthed it out,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. Lutnick on his message to dockworkers who are out of work: "You should be very optimistic and positive, because the president truthed it out, and I rely on the president." Fewer shipments means less work for those who transport imported goods — like dockworkers and truck drivers. “Just today, we had some what north of 235 members who sought work but were not able to get it,” Sal DiContanza, port liaison for the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, told NBC Los Angeles on Friday. “It's beginning to manifest itself as a real loss of jobs and income from our members.” While Lutnick said these American workers should stay “optimistic,” he also said that they can expect the tariffs to stay into the “foreseeable future.” “Most economists, I would say, disagree with you on that,” Bash said. Another study by economists on Trump's first term tariffs concluded that “U.S. tariffs continue to be almost entirely borne by U.S. firms and consumers.” Already, consumers are seeing higher price tags on imported goods due to Trump's tariffs. But Trump administration officials have tried to paint a rosier picture like Lutnick or dodged questions about rising prices altogether. Testifying to Congress last week, Rep. Mark Pocan asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who pays for tariffs. Bessent hemmed and hawed before saying the answer was “very complicated.” Bessent said on Saturday night that there has been “substantial progress” in the talks, while Trump said that the two parties achieved a “total reset … in a friendly, but constructive, manner.” Trump Administration Preparing to Accept Luxury Jet from Qatar's Royal Family: Report 'SNL' Cold Open: 'AA Team' Jeanine Pirro, Pete Hegseth Have One Big, Boozy Reunion Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has warned that Trump's tariffs could cause increased inflation and rising unemployment. It is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Earlier this week, an article published in the tech news outlet Futurism drew attention to a previously unidentified clause in SoundCloud's terms of use, which allows content uploaded to the site to be used as training data for AI. The clause, which was added in February 2024 as part of the company's most recent terms update, reads, in part: “In the absence of a separate agreement that states otherwise, You [the user] explicitly agree that your Content may be used to inform, train, develop or serve as input to artificial intelligence or machine intelligence technologies or services as part of and for providing the services.” In a statement since shared with Pitchfork, representatives for SoundCloud wrote that “SoundCloud has never used artist content to train AI models, nor do we develop AI tools or allow third parties to scrape or use SoundCloud content from our platform for AI training purposes.” They go on to describe other AI “use cases” including “personalized recommendations, content organization, fraud detection, and improvements to content identification,” as well as implementing “technical safeguards” against unauthorized data-scraping. Over the past year and a half, SoundCloud has rolled out a suite of generative AI products designed to assist with music production and distribution. In 2022, the company announced that it would be laying off roughly 20% of its workforce due to recent economic changes. AI companies have been on the receiving end of several lawsuits this decade for infringing on copyrighted works in the training of their AI models. Revisit Marc Hogan's column “Musicians Are Already Using AI More Often Than We Think” on the Pitch. Our focus is on empowering artists with control, clarity, and meaningful opportunities to grow. In fact, we implemented technical safeguards, including a “no AI” tag on our site to explicitly prohibit unauthorized use. Any future application of AI at SoundCloud will be designed to support human artists, enhancing the tools, capabilities, reach and opportunities available to them on our platform. Examples include improving music recommendations, generating playlists, organizing content, and detecting fraudulent activity. These efforts are aligned with existing licensing agreements and ethical standards. We understand the concerns raised and remain committed to open dialogue. Artists will continue to have control over their work, and we'll keep our community informed every step of the way as we explore innovation and apply AI technologies responsibly, especially as legal and commercial frameworks continue to evolve.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"It's like a whole other job," she told the crowd at her Atlantic City show on May 9. Kelly Clarkson is getting candid with fans about why she hasn't been hitting the road lately. It's like a whole other job,” Clarkson said, referencing her band, according to Page Six. The three-time Grammy winner also noted that being a single mother takes up much of her time. Still, Clarkson expressed gratitude for the opportunity to perform two nights at Atlantic City's Hard Rock Live at Etess Arena — her first live shows in nearly six months. Her 90-minute set included fan-favorite hits such as “My Life Would Suck Without You,” “Because of You,” “Breakaway,” “Miss Independent,” “Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)” and “Since U Been Gone.” It marked her first full-length concert since November 2024. Clarkson hasn't embarked on a full tour since 2019. In the years since, she has booked Las Vegas residencies — including shows at PH Live at Planet Hollywood in 2023 and 2024. Her contract is set to expire next year, Page Six reports. The show has earned 22 Daytime Emmy Awards, including eight individual wins for Clarkson herself. Now in its sixth season, The Kelly Clarkson Show averages 1.2 million viewers per day and remains one of the top syndicated talk shows in the country, airing on more than 200 stations nationwide.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although spending time with their families at Disneyland was magical for the remaining season 23 “American Idol” contestants, several members of the top seven — especially those who are parents to young kids — have admitted on social media how stressed and tired they are heading into the Disney themed shows, airing live coast-to-coast on May 11 and 12, 2025. Shortly after the May 5 live show wrapped, the top seven contestants had to quickly finish packing so they could be transported that night to Disneyland, finalist Jamal Roberts shared in a brief post-show Facebook Live. Since their trip to Anaheim — about an hour's drive from the show's Red Studios in Hollywood —  he and others have expressed how stressful it's been to learn and rehearse multiple songs while also juggling the gift of spending family time at Disneyland. The top 7 worked with guest mentor Lin-Manuel Miranda while at Disneyland, each choosing multiple songs from Disney's catalog. The contestants got to spend time with their families in between filming at Disneyland on May 6 and 7, but were back in Hollywood on May 8, “hitting it hard” in the studio, 25-year-old Breanna Nix shared during an Instagram Live that day. “I feel a little bit stressed, just to be honest with you guys,” she admitted after her Disneyland trip with husband Austin and their four-year-old son, Emerson. “Even though Disneyland was so fun, it took a couple days off (from rehearsals) and we have four songs to sing Sunday and Monday and then we have the finale, which is like, right after that. It's like seven songs that we have to learn.” Even those who are eliminated will have be prepared to perform during the May 19 live finale. Roberts also spent time this week juggling spending quality time with his two young daughters at Disneyland and preparing for the next shows, including learning new songs from a list that producers provide, he told WTOK on May 9. So I'm going through the list just listening to see which one will fit me, which one I can make my own. I had to really just learn it, and that is stressful.” I can't even explain how making them smile makes me feel inside.” “I'm blessed that I'm still here in the top seven, to be able to do this week after week, even though it's a lot of work,” he told the paper. I could be doing a million different things, but I get to stand on stage and do something I'm really passionate about in front of millions of people in the world that are invested in my journey.” The next rounds of “American Idol” air live coast-to-coast on May 11 and 12, starting at 8 p.m. Eastern time both nights.</p>

Now, ahead of Emmy's voting commencing next month, Goggins took on the penultimate episode of “SNL 50,” a special moment for him considering it was the annual Mother's Day show as well. To celebrate this, Goggins had his own mother join him on stage for a special dance. Though their dance initially started out as traditional, Goggins and his mother proceeded to show off their Southern roots by kicking off a session of clogging. Related Stories Mara Brock Akil Says Being Her Own ‘First Audience' Led to Her Reinvention of Judy Blume's ‘Forever' How ‘Andor' Season 2 Production Design Gives the Empire Its Oppressive Weight Goggins may have needed to rely on the cue cards for most of the night, but he certainly looked like he was having a lot of fun no matter what. In the bit, Goggins plays an obstructor named Matt who feels the most important amendment next to our right to free speech should simply be “guns.” It's a little hard to laugh at considering how this choice by a small group of men hundreds of years ago continues to wreak havoc on our society, but Goggins and the “SNL” cast's willingness to go there and be as silly as possible in doing so did garner a chuckle or two. We love a weird bit and paired with featured player Jane Wickline's odd sensibility, this one might be the strangest we've seen in a while. It starts silly enough with Wickline finding a baby shoe in Central Park that leads her to launch into song. Goggins nails the self-seriousness of this comic character and also gets a boost from best friend Sam Rockwell, who appears as a balloon-salesman with similarly tiny tootsies. Rumors are abound that this might be Mikey Day's last season at “SNL.” If so, he may be going out on top with one of the most laugh-out-loud moments on Weekend Update in recent memory. Brought on to discuss Trump's tariff chaos, Day is introduced as a “guy who just walked through a spider-web.” This soon comes to define his entire presence rather than the initial purpose of talking about current affairs. Later in the night, we were treated to another Dan Bulla “Midnight Matinee,” which have been popping up frequently this season and always manage to make the mundane utterly unique. This time around, Bulla takes aim at the use of the squatty potty, with Andrew Dismukes playing a recently promoted employee who can't think about anything other than his boss and his wife shitting after seeing the appliance in their bathroom. As a squatty potty user, I feel attacked, but as a fan of “SNL,” I appreciate their ability to find humor in every detail of our existence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>'Friendship' makes plenty of pals at the specialty box office. The ensemble pic led by Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan fell a respectable 55 percent from its opening weekend, compared to an average decline of 57 percent for a title in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and far less that more recent MCU films. Earlier this year, Captain America: Brave New World tumbled more than 65 percent. Thunderbolts*  boasts both enviable reviews and audience scores, which is sparking strong word-or-mouth. 'Godzilla x Kong' Sequel Gets New Title and Teaser as It Starts Production Directed by Jake Schreier, the film brings together a band of dysfunctional outsiders — and lesser-known comic book characters — who discover their potential to be heroes when working together. In addition to Pugh (Yelena Belova) and Stan (Bucky Barnes), the movie features Wyatt Russell (John Walker), David Harbour (Alexei Shostakov/Red Guardian), Lewis Pullman (Bob), Hannah John-Kamen (Ghost), Olga Kurylenko (Taskmaster) and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (CIA director Valentine Allegra de Fontaine). Warner Bros. had plenty to celebrate as Ryan Coogler's sleeper hit Sinners crossed the $200 million mark at the domestic box office for a worldwide total of nearly $300 million. (Jordan has starred in all five of his movies.) A Minecraft Movie — the second-top-grossing video adaptation of all time behind Universal's The Super Mario Bros. Movie, not adjusted for inflation — placed third in its sixth weekend with $8 million for a domestic haul of $409 million and $909.6 million globally. Amazon MGM Studios' The Accountant 2, now in its fourth weekend, enjoyed a fourth-place finish with $6.1 million for a solid domestic total of $50.9 million. Among a handful of smaller titles hoping to drum up business on a nationwide basis, IFC's slasher pic Clown in the Cornfield fared the best in opening to $3.7 million, enough to round out the top five. Lionsgate's Shadow Force and Vertical's Fight or Flight both opened in the $2 million range (the order will be determined Monday morning when final weekend grosses are tallied.) “This relatively quiet weekend is just the calm before the proverbial storm,” says Comscore chief box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian in referencing such upcoming May titles as Final Destination: Bloodlines, Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning, Lilo & Stitch and Karate Kid: Legends. There was action at the specialty box office, thanks to A24's critically acclaimed Friendship, which opened in six cinemas. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration is getting ready to accept a super luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from the royal family of Qatar to replace Air Force One until Donald Trump‘s second term ends, when ownership of the plane will be shifted to his presidential library foundation, ABC News reported, citing sources familiar with the agreement. Trump is scheduled to visit Qatar next week where the gifted plane — which has been described as “a flying palace” worth $400 million — is anticipated to be announced. Trump personally toured the plane in February when it was at West Palm Beach International Airport. It's simply a cash payment to Trump in exchange for favors. The emoluments clause of the Constitution bars federal officeholders from “accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State” without approval from Congress. Per ABC News' sources, Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House Counsel David Warrington determined it is “legally permissible” because the plane will be given on the terms that its ownership will transfer to Trump's presidential library before he leaves office. Government lawyers in the White House and Department of Justice decided that the present does not amount to bribery because it is not being gifted on the condition of an official act. One reason Trump would want a new aircraft from Qatar is that plans to build a new fleet of Air Force One planes have been delayed and over budget on a $3.9 billion contract. Although a contract was signed with Boeing in 2018 — during Trump's first administration — to build the new fleet, the planes were not expected to be ready to use until 2029, after Trump's second term expires. Trump has asked Elon Musk to help expedite the process. While Musk's efforts have moved the delivery date up by two years, Trump is antsy to enjoy a luxurious new Air Force One sometime this year. Concerns about accepting the plane from Qatar include the security ramifications of accepting such a present — one that will not only transport the president but also host sensitive and classified conversations — from a foreign government.

Late last month, the Trump Organization announced it has agreed to build a new Middle East golf course in Qatar in partnership with Qatari Diar, a real estate company created by the nation's sovereign wealth fund.

Koch Theater in New York City According to Us Weekly, Hamrick is a former ballet dancer. Paris Match reported in April that Hamrick “now devotes herself to her son, Deveraux, born in 2016” to her and Jagger. Hamrick has provided details about her relationship with Jagger in some interviews, though. According to Paris Match, Hamrick and Jagger have been together for almost 11 years. She revealed that Jagger had proposed to her several years before the April 2025 interview. “We are so happy in our current life that I would be too afraid to change anything.” According to Us Weekly, Jagger and Hamrick “met in 2014 after a Rolling Stones concert in Tokyo after” after she attended with members of the American Ballet Theatre with complimentary tickets. Jagger is 44 years older than Hamrick, according to Us Weekly. Are the people in my life happy? OK, they can mind their own business.” According to Page Six, Hamrick is no longer performing as a ballerina and is writing novels instead.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"I rarely comment on rumors, but my mama and I are too tight for anything to ever come between us," the singer wrote. On the heels of dropping her new single, the ballad “More to Lose,” the singer released a statement on Saturday (May 10) in response to rumors of a rift with parents Tish and Billy Ray. “But my mama and I are too tight for anything to ever come between us. “Like a lot of moms, she doesn't know how to work her phone and somehow unfollowed me–simple, coincidental, and uninteresting,” she said, in reference to murmurs that Tish had reportedly unfollowed her on the social media app earlier this week. Her statement continued: “My dad and I have had our challenges over the years. I'm at peace knowing bridges have been built and time has done a lot of healing.” “Grateful for the good health and love that flows through my family,” Miley concluded her message. “have no idea how that happened but it's fixed now!” read Tish's reply to one of those comments on Wednesday, May 7. On Wednesday, Billy Ray had posted a video clip with Miley performing at the piano, along with the caption, “Can't wait to see this young lady. On Friday, he uploaded a snapshot of himself with his son Braison, plus Miley and her boyfriend Maxx Morando, all together in celebration of Braison's birthday. Miley's new song “More to Lose” is off of the imminent album Something Beautiful, a 13-track collection due out on May 30. “I tried to keep it a singular take,” she shared with fans about recording the emotional track “More to Lose.” “It's really a song that's more of a story, and I never want that to be interrupted or overthought or chasing perfection. During a special evening with Spotify last week, Cyrus gave more insight into Something Beautiful, revealing the album's overarching theme as “beauty, but not what beauty represents by a standard of someone else's idea.” In another sound-bite from the event, she said — to cheers from the audience — “On a scale of, I think, one to gay, how gay is this album?
