                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To learn more about the CNBC CFO Council, visit cnbccouncils.com/cfo Disney's announcement last week that its newest theme park will be in Abu Dhabi offers further confirmation of the status of the United Arab Emirates as a global consumer crossroads located in the Middle East. Since that 2009 debut for F1 in the region, Ferrari World, Yas Waterworld, Warner Bros. World, and SeaWorld Yas Island have followed. "About 500 million people that are income qualified, meaning they can afford to visit one of our parks, live within a four-hour plane trip here." Since the mid-2000s, Abu Dhabi has been actively pursuing new economic opportunities, with major efforts accelerating in the 2006–2008 period under its strategic Economic Vision 2030 plan, when Yas Island development began. A 6-8 hour flight from 80% of the world's population — and boasting the largest global airline hub in the world, clocking 120 million passengers each year — the strategic geography, massive investment, and major consumer attractions situate Yas Island to continue to expand its status as a global consumer epicenter. Historically, Dubai has led the way in diversifying away from reliance on oil, but Dubai has always been more dependent on non-oil revenue to drive its economy. Included in the UAE economic plan is a target of reducing oil revenue to less than 40% of its GDP. Karen Young, senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, said the center of Abu Dhabi's economic significance remains finance. "Abu Dhabi is a finance capital, led by its multiple sovereign investment vehicles," she said. The Disney park is another display of that economic power. Disney will not be investing capital in the project, although it does have current plans to invest $60 billion in other theme parks around the world. The UAE's investment strength isn't just on display at home, but expanding to many U.S. projects as well, including recent deals to power AI infrastructure within the country. "The theme park is a nice addition to other attractions in Yas island, and is an effort to bring quality of life amenities to residents and tourists," Young said. But she added, "Dubai's economy is much more dependent on tourism." As a result of its greater need, Dubai's success with consumer attractions has been more uneven than Abu Dhabi's, according to experts, which deliberately chose a slower growth model given its significant oil reserves — it gave a financial lifeline to Dubai following the 2008 financial crisis. But the move toward a more diversified economy is showing signs of major acceleration with the Disney deal. Overall, the UAE "is absolutely in a growth mode," said Dennis Speigel, Founder & CEO of International Theme Park Services, an industry consultant. Abu Dhabi and Yas Island have built on demand at a proper pace, he says, developing a critical mass of leisure entertainment. While Dubai, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar have all been trying to attract Disney going back as far as a decade, Speigel said Yas Island is the right location for a Disney theme park in what he referred to as the final frontier for leisure development. Disney isn't saying when the park will open, with executives only pointing to general theme park construction timelines, which can take up to five years from design to development and buildout. As construction of the Disney park proceeds, it may face questions about worker conditions, which have long been an issue of controversy in the region's development boom.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As struggling drugstore chains work to regain their footing, Walgreens is doubling down on automation. The company is expanding the number of retail stores served by its micro-fulfillment centers, which use robots to fill thousands of prescriptions for patients who take medications to manage or treat diabetes, high blood pressure and other conditions. Walgreens aims to free up time for pharmacy staff, reducing their routine tasks and eliminating inventory waste. Walgreens first rolled out the robot-powered centers in 2021, but paused expansion in 2023 to focus on gathering feedback and improving performance at existing sites. After more than a year of making upgrades, including new internal tools, the company said it is ready to expand the reach of that technology again. Walgreens told CNBC it hopes to have its 11 micro-fulfillment centers serve more than 5,000 stores by the end of the year, up from 4,800 in February and 4,300 in October 2023. The deal would cap a turbulent chapter for Walgreens as a public company, marked by a rocky transition out of the pandemic, declining pharmacy reimbursement rates, weaker consumer spending and fierce competition from CVS Health, Amazon and other retail giants. Both companies are racing to stay relevant as online retailers lure away customers and patients increasingly opt for fast home delivery over traditional pharmacy visits. The changes also follow mounting discontent among pharmacy staff: In 2023, nationwide walkouts spotlighted burnout and chronic understaffing, forcing chains to reexamine their operational models. Walgreens said the investment in robotic pharmacy fills is already paying off. To date, micro-fulfillment centers have generated approximately $500 million in savings by cutting excess inventory and boosting efficiency, said Kayla Heffington, Walgreens' pharmacy operating model vice president. "Right now, they're the backbone to really help us offset some of the workload in our stores, to obviously allow more time for our pharmacists and technicians to spend time with patients," said Rick Gates, Walgreens' chief pharmacy officer. Gates added that the centers give Walgreens a competitive advantage because independent pharmacies and some rivals don't have centralized support for their stores. Still, Walmart, Albertsons and Kroger have similarly tested or are currently using their own micro-fulfillment facilities to dispense grocery items and other prescriptions. Micro-fulfillment centers come with their own risks, such as a heavy reliance on sophisticated robotics that can cause disruptions if errors occur. Maintenance medications, or prescription drugs taken regularly to manage chronic health conditions, and refills that don't require immediate pickup are often sent to micro-fulfillment. At the core of each facility is a highly automated system that uses robotics, conveyor belts and barcode scanners, among other tools, to fill prescriptions. The operations are supported by a team of pharmacists pharmacy technicians and other professionals. Instead of staff members filling prescriptions by hand at stores, pill bottles move through an automated and carefully choreographed assembly line. Yellow robotic arms grab a labeled prescription vial and hold it up to a canister, which precisely dispenses the specific medication for that bottle. Certain prescriptions are filled at separate manual stations, including inhalers and birth control pill packs. There are other security and safety measures throughout the process, said Ahlam Antar, registered group supervisor of a micro-fulfillment center in Mansfield, Massachusetts. Properly training workers at the centers to ensure accuracy and patient safety is also crucial, according to Sarah Gonsalves, a senior certified pharmacy technician at the Mansfield site. She said a core part of her role is to make sure that technicians can correctly perform the different tasks in the process. They said that will allow the centers to ship more prescriptions per order and reduce costs. Heffington said the automated locations have helped reduce Walgreens' overall prescription fulfillment costs by nearly 13% compared to a year ago. She said Walgreens has also increased prescription volume by 126% year-over-year, now filling more than 170 million prescriptions annually. Heffington added that Walgreens implemented new internal tools to track the work across all 11 centers and provide real-time data on where a patient's prescription is in the micro-fulfillment process. "If a patient called the store and said, 'Hey, can you tell me where my prescription is today?' [Workers] can do that with great specificity," thanks to the new tools, Heffington said. Despite the company's progress, Gates said there is more work to be done with micro-fulfillment centers. Other improvements may still be needed at facilities, according to some reports. For example, WRAL News reported in April that some customers at a Walgreens store in Garner, North Carolina, say they are only getting partial prescription fills, with several pills missing, or their medicine is being delayed. Before Brian Gange's Arizona store started relying on an automated facility, he walked into the pharmacy every morning knowing that a massive list of prescriptions was in his work queue waiting to be filled for the day. Now, with help from micro-fulfillment, that list is significantly smaller each day, according to Gange. "We don't have to spend as much time on just those repetitive fulfillment tasks," he told CNBC. Gange said that gives him and his team time to step behind the pharmacy counter and interact with customers face-to-face, answering questions, providing advice, performing health tests or administering vaccines. That kind of attention can make all the difference for a patient. For example, Gange recalls stepping away for five minutes to take a patient's blood pressure despite being overwhelmed with tasks while working at a different Walgreens location several years ago. That patient's wife visited the pharmacy the next day to thank Gange, saying her husband "probably wouldn't be here with us today" without that blood pressure test. "I shouldn't have to question whether I have that five or 10 minutes to check a blood pressure for a patient," Gange said. "That really allows us to provide better care for them," he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Media companies are staring down widespread economic uncertainty as their annual pitch to advertisers and marketers kicks off. This week legacy entertainment giants including Comcast's NBCUniversal, Fox Corp. and Warner Bros. Discovery will stage presentations to ad buyers about why they should commit money to their upcoming slates of sports, entertainment and news programming. Netflix and Amazon's Prime Video are crowding the field holding their second annual Upfronts. Paramount Global held its presentations with advertisers and agencies last week. This year the stakes are high as chief marketing officers across brands formulate contingency plans for a variety of outcomes regarding tariffs, inflation, consumer sentiment and other macroeconomic shifts that could affect their spending. And while streaming has begun to reach profitability for some companies, the services have yet to prove as lucrative as the traditional bundle. Meanwhile competition is stiff as digital and social media players capture the lion's share of ad dollars. It'll prove another year of Upfronts clouded by concerns following the Covid pandemic and Hollywood strikes. Last year showed stabilization in an ad market, and executives had earlier told CNBC 2025 was expected to be another year of normalization. "Media becomes more complicated in the landscape that's defined by inflation, regulatory uncertainty, shifting go-to-market timelines, and that serves as this backdrop for the season," said John Halley, ad sales chief at Paramount. That's an important point to make in a market like this." Many executives said they have yet to see a "material" pullback on ad spending, as had been feared. Chief among the top categories during Upfronts is live sports, they said. Live events, like awards shows, and so-called "must-see TV" will also be a big factor in conversations. "Sports is having a halo on live [TV] in general," said Gina Reduto, executive vice president of ad strategy at NBCUniversal. Although general entertainment has fallen behind sports in ratings, shows like Warner Bros. "I think everyone knows that regardless of what happens, they still have to sell, they still have to move [product]," said Rita Ferro, Disney's president of global advertising. That's understanding the parameters we're dealing with and what those implications are in terms of pricing." Concerns that President Donald Trump's trade war could jack up prices have yet to translate into a pullback in advertising spending, media executives told CNBC. Quarterly reports for media companies have yet to reflect any decrease in spend due to tariffs, although the decline of the linear TV bundle has weighed down financials. WBD has yet to see "any material cuts" to its advertising volume, said Ryan Gould and Bobby Voltaggio, the company's presidents of U.S. advertising sales. But you know, obviously, the future state of impact is yet to be known," said Voltaggio. Jeff Collins, Fox's president of ad sales, echoed his peers: "Every client that we're talking with obviously has their scenario planning down for different things that could happen. "But until there's some sort of tangible impact to their business, we haven't seen anyone really looking to pullback." Disney's Ferro said her team has spent additional time with advertising partners in recent months, discussing various scenarios in which tariffs could affect different categories and products. Ferro recounted specific conversations with a mobile phone company (which she declined to identify) that highlight the trade policy volatility: The phone company on a Friday in mid-April decided to pull an order for roughly $1.5 million in advertising for the month in light of tariff exposure. I think there's a lot of scenarios they're going through and it's very in real time," Ferro said. Data firm eMarketer estimated traditional TV advertising spending during Upfronts will decline by between $2.78 billion and $4.12 billion, depending on the severity of the tariff impact. Media companies sell advertising for both platforms together. It's likely the companies that are more affected by the loss of pay-TV subscribers will be willing to lower their pricing, said Jonathan Gudai, CEO of Adomni, a digital advertising platform. Ad data firm EDO said there has already been a pullback on estimated ad spending in the automotive and various retail and consumer sectors since Trump's announcement on tariffs. For example, home appliances brands cut estimated spending by 30%, but consumers' responsiveness to ads rose 77%. Media executives — who largely declined to discuss pricing — all said data from firms like EDO is key in discussions with advertisers, which are increasingly looked for tailored, targeted buys rather than sheer audience size. "Advertisers are saying, 'I want to buy very specific audiences.' That's why outcomes are so important," said Kevin Krim, CEO of EDO. Krim added the need for flexibility makes real-time data more important: "You cannot be using last year's model." He also said it may further shift ad dollars to programmatic buying, putting media companies on a more "level playing field" with digital companies like Meta, Amazon and Google. Despite being behemoths in the ad space, these tech companies have started to reveal the beginnings of cracks in their ad businesses. NBCUniversal's Reduto told CNBC that locking in ads during the Upfronts gives "an opportunity for advertisers to guarantee they have access to the things they know truly drives sales." Earlier this year, Mark Marshall, NBCUniversal's chairman of global advertising and partnerships said in a letter that mapped out the company's upcoming slate of big sports events, including the Super Bowl, Olympics and World Cup, as proof of Upfronts' utility. "I think from an advertiser perspective they still value the ability to lock in the franchise positions that they want to own, lock them in at desirable pricing, and be afforded flexibility," said Collins.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Federal Reserve recently announced its plan to keep interest rates steady, cautioning, "uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further." It noted that the risk of higher unemployment and elevated inflation have risen. Indeed, tariff wars have shaken global markets and knocked investor sentiment. With that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. We start this week with Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms (META), which surpassed analysts' estimates for the first quarter of 2025, reflecting resilience in a tough macroeconomic backdrop. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Meta is well-positioned to navigate any ongoing challenges. In reaction to the strong Q1 print, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth reiterated a buy rating on META stock and boosted the 12-month price target to $675 from $610, saying that Meta remains his firm's top pick. Noting the company's Q1 beat and Q2 outlook, Anmuth said he believed the company's artificial intelligence (AI) ad enhancements, such as Andromeda and GEM, are having a significant impact on its ability to make money from the technology. He added that Meta has a track record of generating returns on increased spending. Anmuth said that AI is fueling huge early gains in Meta's advertising and engagement, with the analyst expecting notable progress soon in business messaging/agents and Meta AI. "We continue to believe that Meta is well positioned for a tougher macro environment given its scaled advertiser base, highly performant platform and vertical agnostic inventory," Anmuth said. 49 among more than 9,500 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Anmuth is also bullish on e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (AMZN). Amazon reported better-than-expected Q1 2025 results but issued soft guidance for the second quarter, citing tariff woes. Though Microsoft's Azure outperformed Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the March quarter and AWS is currently capacity-constrained, the analyst continues to believe that growth can move higher in the second half of the year as more supply comes online. He added that Amazon is not witnessing any visible change in demand. Notably, AWS' operating margin touched an all-time high of 39.5% in the first quarter. The analyst said that while Amazon did not discuss all its mitigation efforts related to suppliers and geographic sourcing of products, it has taken measures to pull forward inventory because of the tariff wars. "Importantly, AMZN remains focused on broad selection, low pricing and fast delivery, and believes it typically emerges from uncertain macro periods with greater relative market share gains," said Anmuth. See Amazon Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks. Finally, let's look at Roku (ROKU), a maker of streaming devices and other products, and a distributor of streaming services. While Roku delivered a modest revenue beat and reported a narrower-than-anticipated loss per share for the first quarter, shares declined as the company trimmed its full-year revenue outlook and issued lower-than-expected Q2 revenue guidance. Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese highlighted that while Roku lowered its 2025 revenue outlook, it maintained Platform revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance, crediting enhanced profit from its initiatives and anticipated revenue from acquiring Frndly TV. Roku last week agreed to buy Frndly TV, an affordable subscription streaming service that offers live TV, on-demand video, and cloud-based DVR (Digital Video Recorder), for $185 million in cash in a deal espected to close in the second quarter. Despite the impact of macroeconomic challenges, Reese believes that Roku is well-positioned within the relatively safe connected TV industry owing to increasing diversification of platform revenue. The analyst also highlighted that a more diversified business model is helping Roku deliver consistent results. Reese thinks that investors will appreciate Roku for its balanced approach as it grows internationally, improves its platform and enhances The Roku Channel's ad capabilities, while focusing on expense discipline to drive free cash flow. "We expect Roku to benefit from its DSP (demand-side platform) partnerships, high-quality inventory, improved targeting sports-adjacent ads, and various price points across its platform to meet advertisers' needs," said Reese, reiterating a buy rating on ROKU stock with a price target of $100.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Social Security Administration is under new leadership, after financial services executive Frank Bisignano was sworn in as commissioner this week. For the approximate 73 million beneficiaries who rely on monthly Social Security checks, those changes may affect how they receive services from the agency. From benefit increases for certain pensioners to changing policies on benefit withholdings and customer service, here are some of the biggest shifts of which beneficiaries should take note. A new law that went into effect in January will provide almost 3 million individuals with increased Social Security benefits. It will also provide lump sum retroactive payments starting from January 2024. Monthly benefit increases may range from "very little" to "over $1,000 more each month," according to the Social Security Administration, which began those adjustments in February. Those workers had previously seen their benefits reduced or eliminated due to the Windfall Elimination Provision and Government Pension Offset, which have been nixed with the new law. More from Personal Finance:Social Security reduces benefit clawback rateTrump administration restarts student loan collectionsWhat experts say about claiming Social Security benefits early However, it may take a year or more to issue payments for some cases that cannot be processed through automation, according to the agency. Social Security beneficiaries are sometimes overpaid benefits due to errors. That money may be withheld from benefit checks until the overpayment has been repaid. In response to complaints that a 100% default withholding rate caused financial hardship for affected beneficiaries, the agency under President Joe Biden changed that default withholding rate to 10% of a beneficiary's monthly benefit or $10, whichever was greater. Under Trump, SSA has had a tougher stance on overpayments. However, the agency recently issued an emergency message notifying its employees that new overpayment notices sent on or after April 25 will have a 50% default withholding rate. That applies to retirement, survivors and disability insurance benefits. The withholding rate for Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, benefits is still 10%. Some experts worry a 50% default withholding rate is still too high. Overpayment of Social Security is not the only reason benefits may be withheld. Now, the Education Department may use the Treasury Department Offset Program to withhold benefits for defaulted loans, as well as other payments like tax refunds and salaries. The Social Security Administration may also withhold current and future Social Security checks for child support, alimony or restitution payments, according to the agency. The IRS may take a portion of Social Security payments until it recoups the full balance of overdue federal tax debts. Individuals who call SSA's 800 phone number face long hold times before they speak to someone at the agency. To make an in-person appointment, they must either call that number or visit the website, which has experienced glitches. Those difficulties are "neither new nor unique to the current administration," Republican House Ways and Means Committee members recently wrote to Bisignano. Meanwhile, Democrats worry those difficulties could signal bigger problems ahead. The agency is in the process of modernizing its telecommunications platform, which is expected to allow it to better manage calls and provide more self-service options. The rollout, which is expected to be completed by the end of this summer, has helped improve answer rates and average speed of answer, based on early results, according to the Social Security Administration. "The vast majority of his current customer base cannot transact financial business through anything other than face to face contact in an office or on the telephone, and they have to be prepared to accommodate that," said Maria Freese, senior legislative representative at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. Under DOGE, the Social Security Administration sought to make it so services that could previously be handled over the phone would need to be done in person at an agency office to prevent fraud. However, the agency has since scaled back that policy to allow for claims for retirement, survivor and spousal and children's benefits to still be permitted over the phone. Individuals making other claims, including Social Security disability insurance, Medicare and Supplemental Security Income, can also still use the agency's 800 number. Consequently, almost 2 million more elderly and disabled individuals may need to visit Social Security offices in person annually, the Social Security Administration has revealed. The online process may be difficult for some individuals because it requires multi-factor, multi-step online verification and a one-time PIN code, CBPP notes. The agency has "left this very convoluted system in place to use the telephone in order to change your banking information, but for the vast majority of seniors and members of the disability community, they're never going to be able to use it," Freese said. Direct deposit fraud represents less than one-hundredth of one percent of benefits that are misdirected, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The Social Security Administration plans to roll out a new secure digital form of identification as an alternative to traditional paper cards beginning early this summer. The new digital feature will allow individuals who have either forgotten their Social Security number or who have lost their Social Security cards to access their personal number online through the agency's My Social Security website. They will also be able to access their Social Security numbers through digital devices and display them as identification for "reasons other than handling Social Security matters," according to the agency.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As a small business owner, Ramon van Meer said he's used to hearing people say they'd be willing to pay more for products made in America. When President Donald Trump ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese imports by an additional 145%, van Meer decided to see if shoppers would put their money where their mouth is. So the serial entrepreneur set about finding US suppliers to make his best-selling product: a specialized filtered shower head. All told, he found it would cost three times as much to produce — more than the cost of simply paying the tariff. "When somebody has to pay for it, that's the actual real data," he added. After several days and more than 25,000 visitors, he said he sold 584 of the lower-priced shower heads and not one single purchase of a US-made version. In a blog post that went viral, van Meer called the results "sobering." "We wanted to believe customers would back American labor with their dollars. Nowadays van Meer said he's spending most of his time trying to shift production out of China to a country with a lower tariff rate. "Staying in China is not sustainable because even if they make a deal, we don't know what's going to happen," he said. "The United States is also not an option, because there's just no facilities that can make it." Van Meer said Afina currently has enough inventory in its US warehouses to last until August, at which point he would have to start charging for the tariff. Asked whether he would roll that cost into the price or apply a surcharge, as other businesses have said they would do, van Meer said he hadn't yet decided.</p>
