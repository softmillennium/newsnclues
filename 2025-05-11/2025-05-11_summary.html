            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he is prepared to meet Vladimir Putin this week, shortly after US President Donald Trump urged him to “immediately” accept the Russian leader's offer to hold peace talks in Turkey.
    


            After meeting in Kyiv on Saturday, Ukraine's major European allies gave Russia an ultimatum: agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine by Monday or face “massive” new sanctions. Trump supported the initiative, Germany's new chancellor Friedrich Merz said.
    


            In a late-night address, Putin did not acknowledge the ultimatum. Ignoring the ceasefire offer, he instead proposed holding “direct talks” with Ukraine in Turkey on Thursday – something not seen since the early weeks of Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022.
    


            Ukraine's allies spent Sunday stressing that there could be no further talks before Putin agrees to an unconditional ceasefire. But Trump undermined the efforts to put pressure on Putin, saying that Ukraine should “immediately” agree to meet with Russian officials on Thursday.
    


            “HAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
    


            Within an hour, Zelensky said he was prepared to meet with Putin this week, in what would be the leaders' first meeting since Russia launched its war.
    


            “I will be waiting for Putin in Türkiye on Thursday. Personally. I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses,” Zelensky said Sunday on X.
    


            Although Zelensky said a “full and lasting ceasefire” from Monday would provide “the necessary basis for diplomacy,” he did not specify that this would be a precondition for attending the talks.
    


            Whereas Putin on Saturday faced a joint call from Europe and the US to accept a ceasefire by Monday's deadline, his counteroffer of “direct” talks had by Sunday relieved much of the pressure on Moscow and shifted the focus to the potential talks this week. European leaders have not yet said whether they will press ahead with the threatened additional sanctions on Russia if a ceasefire is not in place by Monday.
    


            Before Trump's comment, Zelensky had responded with trepidation to Putin's offer, calling it a “positive sign,” but stressing that Kyiv first expects Moscow to agree to the new ceasefire proposal. Ukraine's European allies more forcefully dismissed Putin's offer, saying there could be no new talks before a ceasefire.
    


            Merz, Germany's new chancellor, said talks “cannot begin until weapons fall silent.” Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the world was still waiting on Russia's “univocal decision on an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.” French President Emmanuel Macron said Putin's counter-offer was “not enough.”
    


            Keith Kellogg, the Trump administration's special envoy to Ukraine, whose influence has dwindled since January, echoed the Europeans' claims, saying a ceasefire must come before talks, “not the other way round.”
    


            But Trump abandoned his earlier demand that Russia agree to a 30-day ceasefire, instead calling on Ukraine to attend the peace talks without preconditions.
    


            For months, Ukraine and its allies tried to convince the Trump administration that Putin acts in bad faith, and have said Russia's agreeing to a ceasefire could function as a test of whether it is serious about achieving the peace the US president has long demanded.
    


            But Putin's offer for direct talks – made in a rare televised address at 1 a.m. local time Sunday – was a gamble to distract from the fact that Russia is likely to snub Monday's ceasefire deadline, analysts said.
    


            Putin's offer put Zelensky under “huge pressure” to agree to hold talks in Turkey, Sergey Radchenko, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, told CNN.
    


            “Why? Because otherwise, he'll have to deal with Trump, who's going to say, ‘Why are you undermining my peace initiative here? Why can't you just talk?'”
    


            Already setting the stage for talks, Putin spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday. The Kremlin said Erdogan “fully supported” Putin's proposal for peace talks and had offered Istanbul as a venue.
    


            Although Ankara confirmed Turkey is ready to host the negotiations, a statement from the country's presidency suggested that it agreed with Ukraine's allies that a ceasefire must come before talks.

            “Noting that a window of opportunity to achieve peace has opened, President Erdoğan said that a comprehensive ceasefire would create the necessary environment for peace talks,” the statement read. It did not say whether Turkey would decline to host the talks if Russia refused the ceasefire offer.
    


            The White House said Secretary of State Marco Rubio will visit Turkey from Wednesday to Friday, to attend an informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers and discuss “ending the Russia-Ukraine war,” meaning he will be in the country on the day of Putin's proposed peace talks.
    


            Trump's dropping of his demand for Russia to agree to a ceasefire marks a dramatic change in approach. Last week, Trump had called for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine, without providing a deadline. “If the ceasefire is not respected, the US and its partners will impose further sanctions,” he warned. The European leaders in Kyiv added weight to the threat by naming Monday as a deadline.
    


            Radchenko said that Putin's late-night offer of peace talks was an attempt to shift the pressure on Russia back onto Ukraine.
    


            “He knows that Trump wants direct talks,” Radchenko said. “Now, by saying, ‘Look, we're offering talks and the Ukrainians are the ones who are not agreeing,' he is putting the ball back in Kyiv's court.”
    


            As well as distracting from his snubbing the ceasefire proposal, the offer allowed Putin to pose “as the peacemaker, kindly inviting Ukraine to the table,” Radchenko said. “He's seen as taking the initiative.”
    


            In his address, Putin said Russia does not rule out that “during these talks there will be a possibility to arrange some kind of new truce, a new ceasefire,” but stressed that the talks will aim to eliminate the “root causes” of the conflict.
    


            Around the same time as Putin's late-night speech, a three-day pause in fighting ordered by Russia's leader came to an end, with Ukraine reporting more than 100 drone attacks overnight. Both sides accused each other of continuing attacks during the truce, ordered by Putin to mark Russia's World War II Victory Day.

News of present from royal family ignited accusations of bribery and corruption, as well as criticism against president

Donald Trump is reportedly ready to accept a luxury plane described to be a “palace in the sky” being offered to the US president as a gift from Qatar's royal family, almost immediately igniting accusations of bribery and corruption as well as commensurate criticism.

On Sunday, citing multiple sources familiar with the matter, ABC reported that the Trump administration was girding itself to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8, a jumbo jet from the Qatari royals that was estimated to be about $400m. Trump would then use the 13-year-old plane as the new Air Force One until shortly before the conclusion of his second Oval Office stint, at which point it would be transferred to his presidential library foundation no later than 1 January 2029.

The luxury gift from Qatar is expected to be announced next week during Trump's three-day tour of the Middle East that includes Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, ABC reported.

Trump toured the opulent plane in February while it was parked at the West Palm Beach international airport, ABC added.

Assuming Trump accepts the plane as planned, the jumbo jet would first be transferred to the US air force so the military branch could configure the aircraft to meet the specifications required for presidential travel, ABC's sources told the network. The network added that any costs affiliated with its transfer would be paid for by the US air force, which receives a significant portion of the revenue generated by federal taxpayers.

According to ABC's sources, Trump's attorney general Pam Bondi and his top White House lawyer David Warrington have pre-emptively concluded that it is “legally permissible” for Trump to accept the luxury gift and then transfer it over to his presidential library.

Both reportedly arrived at that conclusion after lawyers for the White House counsel's office as well as the justice department said the gifted plane was not conditioned on any official act and therefore was not bribery.

Those lawyers drafted an analysis for defense secretary Pete Hegseth which reiterated that nothing about the plane violated federal laws prohibiting US government officials accepting gifts from foreign states or their royals. In fact, ABC's sources said, Bondi's reading of the situation was that the plane was being given to the US air force and then Trump's presidential library foundation rather than her boss himself.

Nevertheless, reports of the highly unusual – if not unprecedented – gift that Trump's subordinates had afforded their blessing for him to receive triggered a wave of criticisms towards the president.

On X, Democratic congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland said: “Trump must seek Congress' consent to take this $300m from Qatar. The Constitution is perfectly clear: no present of any kind whatever' from a foreign state without Congressional permission. A gift you use for four years and then deposit in your library is still a gift (and a grift).”

Democratic pollster Matt McDermott echoed similar sentiments, saying: “Literally speechless…

“A foreign regime gifting a jet to a former president. It's bribery in broad daylight.”

McDermott remarked that the Trump Organization run by the president's children only days earlier had announced a new $5.5bn golf course in Qatar.

“Today: Qatar ‘gifts' Trump a luxury jet. Surely just a coincidence,” McDermott said.

Meanwhile, Harvard University international security professor Juliette Kayyem said: “The surveillance and security aspects are also as disturbing as the grift.”

The CNN security analyst added that “Qatar will surely offer a plane that satisfies their needs as well.”

CNN medical analyst Jonathan Reiner took to X and said: “Air Force One is a (checks notes) Air Force plane. A military aircraft. It's not intended to be a palace because the US doesn't have a king.”

Similarly, New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman and prolific Trump scoopster wrote that the plane in question was “likely the most expensive gift from a foreign government in US history and will likely raise questions from legal experts”.

She added: “If Trump continued using it out of office, it would give him access to a much more modern plane than Trump Force One,” which is a private Boeing 757 built in 1991 that belongs to the organization run by his sons.

            US President Donald Trump said Ukraine should “immediately” agree to Vladimir Putin's offer to hold “direct” peace talks in Turkey this week, undermining European efforts to force the Russian president to agree to an unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine by Monday.
    


            After Trump last week said the US will impose more sanctions on Russia if it does not agree to a truce, the leaders of France, Britain, Germany, Poland and Ukraine met in Kyiv on Saturday to send an ultimatum to Putin: agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine by Monday or face “massive” new sanctions. Trump supported the initiative, the European leaders said.
    


            But in a late-night address, Putin did not acknowledge the ultimatum. Instead, he proposed holding “direct talks” with Ukraine in Turkey on Thursday – something not seen since the early weeks of Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022.
    


            “The decision now lies with the Ukrainian authorities,” Putin said.
    


            Although Ukraine and its allies stressed that there could be no further talks before a ceasefire, Trump on Sunday called on Ukraine to take part in the peace talks without a ceasefire.
    


            “Ukraine should agree to this, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “HAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!”
    


            After weeks of what appeared to be thawing relations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and impatience with Moscow's prevarications on ending the war, Trump's intervention will relieve the pressure on Putin and force Kyiv into an uncomfortable position.
    


            Before Trump's comment, Zelensky had responded with trepidation to Putin's offer, calling it a “positive sign,” but stressing that Kyiv first expects Moscow to agree to the new ceasefire proposal.
    


            Within hours, Ukraine's allies issued much more forceful rebuttals to Putin's offer, saying there can be no new talks before a ceasefire.
    


            Friedrich Merz, Germany's new chancellor, said talks “cannot begin until weapons fall silent.” Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the world is still waiting on Russia's “univocal decision on an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.” French President Emmanuel Macron said Putin's counter-offer is “not enough.”
    


            Keith Kellogg, the Trump administration's special envoy to Ukraine, whose influence has dwindled since January, echoed the Europeans' claims, saying a ceasefire must come before talks, “not the other way round.”
    


            But Trump abandoned his earlier demand that Russia agree to a 30-day ceasefire, instead calling on Ukraine to attend the peace talks without preconditions.
    


            “I'm starting to doubt that Ukraine will make a deal with Putin,” Trump said.
    


            For months, Ukraine and its allies tried to convince the Trump administration that Putin acts in bad faith, and have said Russia's agreeing to a ceasefire could function as a test of whether it is serious about achieving the peace the US president has long demanded.
    


            But Putin's offer for direct talks – made in a rare televised address at 1 a.m. local time Sunday – was a gamble to put the ball back in Ukraine's court and distract from the fact that Russia is likely to snub Monday's ceasefire deadline, analysts said. Trump's comment suggests that gamble has worked.
    


            Zelensky will be under “huge pressure” to agree to hold talks in Turkey, Sergey Radchenko, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, told CNN.
    


            “Why? Because otherwise, he'll have to deal with Trump, who's going to say, ‘Why are you undermining my peace initiative here? Why can't you just talk?'”
    


            Already setting the stage for talks, Putin spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday. The Kremlin said Erdogan “fully supported” Putin's proposal for peace talks and had offered Istanbul as a venue.
    


            Although Ankara confirmed Turkey is ready to host the negotiations, a statement from the country's presidency suggested that it agreed with Ukraine's allies that a ceasefire must come before talks.

            “Noting that a window of opportunity to achieve peace has opened, President Erdoğan said that a comprehensive ceasefire would create the necessary environment for peace talks,” the statement read. It did not say whether Turkey would decline to host the talks if Russia refused the ceasefire offer.
    


            The White House said Secretary of State Marco Rubio will visit Turkey from Wednesday to Friday, to attend an informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers and discuss “ending the Russia-Ukraine war,” meaning he will be in the country on the day of Putin's proposed peace talks.
    


            In a little over a day, the unity that was on display between Trump and the five European leaders in Kyiv seems to have dissipated.
    


            Last week, Trump had called for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine, without providing a deadline. “If the ceasefire is not respected, the US and its partners will impose further sanctions,” he warned. The European leaders in Kyiv added weight to the threat by naming Monday as a deadline. Merz said the leaders had called Trump, who “supports our initiative.”
    


            “Putin is very eager to make sure he retains American goodwill, because there's the parallel process of Russia-American normalization that's going on” alongside efforts to end the war in Ukraine, said Radchenko.
    


            “He knows that Trump wants direct talks,” Radchenko said. “Now, by saying, ‘Look, we're offering talks and the Ukrainians are the ones who are not agreeing,' he is putting the ball back in Kyiv's court.”
    


            In his address, Putin said Russia does not rule out that “during these talks there will be a possibility to arrange some kind of new truce, a new ceasefire,” but stressed that the talks will aim to eliminate the “root causes” of the conflict.
    


            Around the same time as Putin's late-night speech, a three-day pause in fighting ordered by Russia's leader came to an end, with Ukraine reporting more than 100 drone attacks overnight. Both sides accused each other of continuing attacks during the truce, ordered by Putin to mark Russia's World War II Victory Day.
    


            Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told CNN that Russia is “very grateful” for Washington's mediation efforts, but added that “at the same time, it's quite useless to try to press on us.”

"There is no point in prolonging the killings. And I will wait for Putin on Thursday in Turkey," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

This week, the world watched in anticipation for Russia's Victory Day parade after President Volodymyr Zelensky commented that he could not guarantee the safety of those attending. Meanwhile, the European Union moves one step forward to banning Russian gas from the European continent. It is also revealed this week that U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has fallen out of step with the White House.

"(Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin... doesn't want to have a ceasefire agreement with Ukraine, but rather wants to meet on Thursday, in Turkey, to negotiate a possible end to the bloodbath. Ukraine should agree to this, immediately," U.S. President Donald Trump said.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will travel to  to Antalya, Turkey, for a NATO foreign ministers' meeting from May 14–16, where he is expected to address the war in Ukraine and push for stronger Allied defense commitments.

Preliminary findings suggest that one of the men killed the other before taking his own life. 

Western leaders dismissed the Kremlin's proposal for talks in Istanbul on May 15 as insufficient.

The Kremlin said the leaders held a detailed discussion about the Russian initiative and Erdogan expressed full support, reiterating Turkey's readiness to provide a venue and assist in organizing the negotiations.

Erdogan told Macron that international cooperation is critical for initiating peace negotiations and the "sensitive implementation" of Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction processes, the Turkish Presidency reported.

The pope said he was praying to God to grant the world the "miracle of peace."

Ushakov's comments follow Russian President Vladimir Putin's May 11 invitation for direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul starting May 15.

The assault began around 2 a.m. on May 11, with Russian forces deploying 108 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy UAVs from multiple directions, Ukraine's Air Force said.

Zelensky called a ceasefire the essential first step toward ending the war.

The number includes 1,310 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

"Think of the hundreds of thousands of lives that will be saved as this never ending 'bloodbath' hopefully comes to an end... I will continue to work with both sides to make sure that it happens." 

"An unconditional ceasefire is not preceded by negotiations," French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters on May 11. 

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico arrived in Moscow on May 9 to celebrate Victory Day, commemorating the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. 

Slovak and Russian press agencies reported that Fico was accompanied by other politicians from his party, including Erik Kaliniak, Lubos Blaga, Richard Gluck. A deputy from the far-right Slovak National Party, Miroslav Radachovsky, was also a part of the group.

During his visit, Fico is expected to hold bilateral talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and a government representative of Vietnam.

Fico, who anticipated arriving in Moscow on May 8, was delayed in his arrival, following the Baltic states' decision to bar Slovakia's government plane from flying over their respective country's airspace en route to Moscow.

"Estonia informed us a couple of minutes ago that it will not allow us to fly over its territory," Fico wrote on Facebook. "Of course, we are talking about a deliberate attempt to disrupt my visit to Moscow on the occasion of the official celebration of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II."

The Kremlin uses the annual victory celebrations for propaganda purposes and to showcase its military might, while Russian propaganda leans heavily on the Soviet victory in World War II.

Fico is known for inflammatory statements on Ukraine and the war that often echo Moscow's talking points. He has repeatedly criticized military aid for Ukraine and called for restoring relations with Russia after the war.

Fico's planned visit comes as another jab at the Western efforts to internationally isolate Putin over Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine. Slovakia is a member state of both NATO and the EU.

            Three energy-rich Gulf Arab nations are racing to turn their influence over Donald Trump into tangible gains with the president set to visit next week.
    


            They have built personal ties with the president and collectively pledged trillions in US investments while casting themselves as key intermediaries in conflicts Trump wants to resolve, from Gaza to Ukraine and Iran.
    


            Now, they're being rewarded with the privilege of hosting Trump's first state visit of his second term. The US president is set to land in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, followed by visits to Qatar and then the United Arab Emirates that stretch till May 16.
    


            Given Trump's transactional approach to foreign policy, the three states have much to offer
    

Ahead of Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East, analyst Firas Maksad looks at the what the U.S. president may accomplish on his trip, and tells Becky Anderson why he thinks the prospect of Saudi-Israeli normalization is dead.

            “In Trump's book, the Gulf states tick all the right boxes,” Hasan Alhasan, senior fellow for Middle East policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Bahrain, told CNN. They “pledge to invest trillions in the US economy and spend colossal amounts on US weapons systems,” he said.
    


            Behind this carefully crafted strategy of wooing Trump is a desire from Gulf states to solidify and formalize their positions as the US' indispensable security and economic partners, and extract as much benefit for themselves as they can.
    


            US-Gulf relations have improved significantly since Trump returned to office. Frustrated at the perceived lack of US interest in their needs under the Biden administration, Saudi Arabia and the UAE had sought to diversify their military, technological and economic ties. With Trump in office, they see what one Gulf official called “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” for to achieve his country's objectives.
    


            From their perspective, now is the time to cement ties with Washington, and even “secure greater privileges in their relationship with the world's most powerful nation,” Ebtesam AlKetbi, founder and president of the Emirates Policy Center think tank in Abu Dhabi, said.
    


            Each of the three nations Trump is visiting has its own list of priorities. Here's what they want from the US and how they're going about achieving it.
    


            “Security, security and security” is what Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states seek most from Trump's visit, said Ali Shihabi, an author and commentator on politics and economics of Saudi Arabia.
    


            “Gulf States are looking for reassurance of the US security commitment to the Gulf's stability,” Shihabi told CNN. “Trump has many priorities and has been known to lose interest quickly… and they want to keep him engaged.”
    


            Last year, the US and Saudi Arabia came close to finalizing a landmark defense and trade pact – but the deal stalled over Saudi insistence that Israel commit to a path toward Palestinian statehood.
    


            Firas Maksad, managing director for the Middle East and North Africa at Eurasia Group, told CNN's Becky Anderson that Trump is likely to move ahead with major deals regardless of normalization, which he said is “dead.”
    


            Riyadh is also seeking US cooperation to develop a civil nuclear program, but that has been held over its insistence on enriching uranium domestically – raising concerns in the US and Israel over nuclear weapons proliferation. Uranium, when enriched to high levels, can be used to produce nuclear weapons.

            White House backing for a Saudi nuclear program could see American firms win lucrative contracts.
    


            Riyadh appears to be framing its relationship with the US as a win-win. In March, Trump said he'd go to Saudi Arabia if it invests $1 trillion in the US. “They've agreed to do that, so I'm going to be going there,” he said.
    


            While Saudi Arabia didn't confirm that figure, it announced plans in January to expand trade and investment with the US by $600 billion over four years, with potential for more.



            But for Riyadh to diversify away from oil, it still needs to sell oil – at a healthy profit – to fund that transition. Recent price drops, driven in part by Trump's tariffs, threaten to undermine those ambitions. Trump has made clear he wants oil prices lower, putting him at odds with Saudi Arabia's need for high revenues to finance its economic transformation.
    


            Perhaps more than any other Gulf state, the UAE sees investment as central to its strategy for deepening ties with the US and securing returns – and it has money to back it up. Among the world's richest countries per capita, it has pledged trillions in US investments. Abu Dhabi has even branded itself “the capital of capital.”
    


            “Expanding trade and investment is a way to reinforce this strategic partnership,” AlKetbi said. “The US remains a critical security guarantor for the Gulf region, while also offering a dynamic economy full of opportunities and capabilities that align with the long-term Gulf development plans.”
    


            In March, the UAE announced a $1.4 trillion investment plan over 10 years focused on AI, semiconductors, manufacturing, and energy. Its existing US investments already total $1 trillion, according to its embassy in Washington.

            “The UAE sees a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to become a significant contributor in AI and advanced technology,” Anwar Gargash, diplomatic adviser to the UAE president, told CNN. “The commitment to invest $1.4 trillion… aligns with the UAE's goal to diversify its economy away from its over reliance on hydrocarbons to ensure prosperity for the country in the future.”
    


            But it won't be easy for Abu Dhabi to achieve its stated goal of becoming a global leader in AI by 2031 without US microchips.
    


            During the final days of former President Joe Biden's administration, the US tightened curbs on AI exports to keep advanced technology out of the hands of foreign adversaries like China, which were meant to take effect on May 15. The UAE has been one of the countries facing restrictions and may expect them to be lifted during Trump's trip.
    


            On Thursday, the US announced that Trump will rescind a set of the Biden-era curbs.
    


            Qatar is the Gulf Arab nation with the most formalized security ties with the US. It hosts the biggest US military installation in the Middle East, which the State Department describes as “indispensable” for US military operations in the region.
    


            Last year, the US quietly reached an agreement that extends its military presence at the sprawling base in Qatar for another 10 years. It also amended a 1992 defense cooperation agreement with the US, which is meant to further strengthen their security partnership.
    


            In 2022, the Biden administration also designated Qatar as a Major Non-NATO Ally, a title granted to close friends that have strategic working relationships with the US military.
    


            Qatar has been a key mediator in a number of conflicts – from the war in Gaza to Afghanistan. Experts say it is part of an effort to remain relevant in the eyes of Washington.
    


            “The Gulf states view conflict mediation as a source of influence and prestige,” Alhasan told CNN. “They have managed to use their role as mediators to position themselves as indispensable partners for Trump's political agenda.”
    


            Doha also maintains close ties with Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, who has been on a quest to relieve his country of years-long sanctions by the West.

            Syria is expected to be a key issue that Qatar will raise with Trump when he visits, an official with knowledge of the matter told CNN Thursday. Doha is pushing the Trump administration to lift sanctions on Syria under the Caesar Act, the official said, adding that Qatar is wary about providing any financial support to Syria without Washington's blessing.
    


            Trump's visit is ultimately about what he can get out of the three Gulf states, experts said, adding that each of the three nations is anticipating a set of new deals that will benefit both parties.
    


            “He's coming here because he believes it is in the interest of the US economy, perhaps his interest and those around him, to have those deals here with Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar,” Maksad said. “So expect big announcements.”

Artist borrows from past masters to create centrepiece of latest show, his first major mural in England

There was a time when Nicolas Party would be pursued by police for decorating trains and buildings across Europe with his distinctive street art. Now, grand galleries and museums invite him to unleash his visions on their walls.

His latest extraordinary piece, a large mural in soft pastel inspired by the works of a 17th-century Dutch artist and an 18th-century British master has materialised at the Holburne Museum in Bath.

As the finishing touches were being put to the work, Party said he was thrilled that the Holburne, housed in a late-18th-century building and the custodian of paintings by the likes of Thomas Gainsborough and George Stubbs, was hosting his work. “It's great to be in a grand place like this.”

For his new piece, his first major mural in an English gallery, Party borrowed from a small oil painting in the Holburne's collection, A Brawl Between Peasants, by Benjamin Gerritsz. Cuyp, a Dutch painter known for his allegorical oil panels and landscapes, influenced by Rembrandt.

Over four days he recreated the rather violent image over a whole wall of a gallery, raising an awful lot of pastel dust.

He used pastels again for a second, smaller work, this time on linen – a depiction of two horses in the style of Stubbs's horse and lion paintings, with a calm, ghostly human face between them.

The second work was then hung at the centre of the mural, obscuring much of the action. Party's mural is called A Brawl Between Peasants, After Benjamin Gerritsz, 2025. The second, smaller piece is Portrait With Two Horses, 2025.

The artist said he was drawn to the Dutch painting because he liked the “grim, funny” subject matter. “It's not a portrait or a sweet landscape, it's more unusual.” The mural is a close copy and Party said the addition of the second element – the horses and face image – made it his work.

It didn't worry him that the most dramatic part of the mural was hidden behind the smaller image, he said. “I think my work becomes my work when I put the two together.”

A chamber had to be built in front of the wall for Party to work in. The wall has to be prepared with acrylic paint, water and sawdust to create a sandpapery texture that holds the pastel.

“So that makes a little mess and the pastel generates a lot of dust. That's why we have to be enclosed.” He then uses both hands, applying the pastel and rubbing it to create textures and colours. “It's quite tiring so I use both arms.”

The piece is the showstopper in an exhibition called Nicolas Party: Copper & Dust, which features two rooms of smaller works including striking landscapes, still lifes and portraits, created out of oil on copper.

Chris Stephens, the director of the Holburne, said the gallery was excited to show Party's work. “With his deep knowledge of the history of art, especially his interest in 17th-century Dutch painting and in 18th-century pastels, both of which feature in the Holburne's collection, Nicolas's art is in a perfect setting.”

Nicolas Party: Copper & Dust, runs from 12 May until 31 August.

Tufts University student from Turkey, Rumeysa Ozturk, left, who was arrested by immigration agents while walking along a street in a Boston suburb, talks to reporters upon arriving back in Boston, May 10, a day after she was released from a Louisiana immigration detention center on the orders of a federal judge.Matthew J. Lee/The Associated Press

A Tufts University student from Turkey returned to Boston on Saturday, one day after being released from a Louisiana immigration detention centre where she was held for over six weeks.

Upon arrival at Logan Airport, Rumeysa Ozturk told reporters she was excited to get back to her studies during what has been a “very difficult” period.

“In the last 45 days, I lost both my freedom and also my education during a crucial time for my doctoral studies,” she said. “But I am so grateful for all the support, kindness and care.”

A federal judge ordered Ozturk's release Friday pending a final decision on her claim that she was illegally detained following an op-ed she co-wrote last year criticizing her university's response to Israel and the war in Gaza.

Ozturk said she will continue her case in the courts, adding, “I have faith in the American system of justice.”

She was joined by her lawyers and two of Massachusetts' Democratic members of Congress, Sen. Edward Markey and Rep. Ayanna Pressley.

“Today is a tremendous day as we welcome you back, Rumeysa,” Markey said. “You have made millions and millions of people across our country so proud of the way you have fought.”

Appearing by video for her bail hearing the previous day, Ozturk, 30, detailed her growing asthma attacks in detention and her desire to finish her doctorate focusing on children and social media.

U.S. District Judge William Sessions in Vermont ruled that she was to be released on her own recognizance with no travel restrictions. She was not a danger to the community or a flight risk, he said, while noting that he might amend the release order to consider any conditions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, in consultation with her lawyers.

Sessions said the government offered no evidence for why Ozturk was arrested other than the op-ed.

The U.S. Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review did not respond to an e-mail message seeking comment Friday afternoon.

Ozturk was one of four students who wrote the opinion piece last year in campus newspaper The Tufts Daily. It criticized the university's response to student activists demanding that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.

On March 25 immigration officials surrounded Ozturk in Massachusetts and took her into custody. She was then driven to New Hampshire and Vermont and flown to a detention centre in Basile, Louisiana.

Her student visa had been revoked several days earlier, but she was not informed of that, her lawyers said.

Ozturk's lawyers first filed a petition on her behalf in Massachusetts, but they did not know where she was and were unable to speak to her until more than 24 hours after she was detained. A Massachusetts judge later transferred the case to Vermont.

A State Department memo said Ozturk's visa was revoked following an assessment that her actions “‘may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization' including co-authoring an op-ed that found common cause with an organization that was later temporarily banned from campus.”

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in March, without providing evidence, that investigations found that Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, which the U.S. has designated as a terrorist group.

This week a federal appeals court upheld Sessions' order to bring Ozturk back to New England for hearings to determine whether her constitutional rights, including free speech and due process, were violated, as her lawyers argue.

Immigration proceedings for Ozturk, initiated in Louisiana, are being conducted separately in that state and Ozturk can participate remotely, the court said.

A federal judge in California temporarily blocked the Department of Government Efficiency's bureaucratic overhaul.

A federal judge in California on Friday temporarily blocked what at coalition of labor unions, local governments, and nonprofits argued was “the unconstitutional dismantling of the federal government by the president of the United States on a scale unprecedented in this country's history and in clear excess of his authority.”

Since returning to office in January, U.S. President Donald Trump — aided by his so-callled Department of Government Efficiency and its de facto leader, billionaire Elon Musk — has worked to quickly overhaul the bureaucracy, even though “the president does not possess authority to reorganize, downsize, or otherwise transform the agencies of the federal government, unless and until Congress authorizes such action,” as the coalition's complaint notes.

District Judge Susan Illston agreed with the groups and governments, which include the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Alliance for Retired Americans, Main Street Alliance, Natural Resources Defense Council, the city and county of San Francisco, Chicago, Baltimore, and more.

“The president has the authority to seek changes to executive branch agencies, but he must do so in lawful ways and, in the case of large-scale reorganizations, with the cooperation of the legislative branch,” wrote Illston in a 42-page decision. “Many presidents have sought this cooperation before; many iterations of Congress have provided it. Nothing prevents the president from requesting this cooperation — as he did in his prior term of office.”

“Indeed, the court holds the president likely must request congressional cooperation to order the changes he seeks, and thus issues a temporary restraining order to pause large-scale reductions in force in the meantime,” said the judge, appointed to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California by former President Bill Clinton.

Illston added that “a temporary restraining order is, by definition, temporary. The court will not consider defendants' request for a stay of execution of the temporary restraining order, as doing so would render the exercise pointless. The court must promptly proceed to consideration of a preliminary injunction.”

Welcoming the development in a late Friday statement, the plaintiff coalition said that “the Trump administration's unlawful attempt to reorganize the federal government has thrown agencies into chaos, disrupting critical services provided across our nation.”

“Each of us represents communities deeply invested in the efficiency of the federal government — laying off federal employees and reorganizing government functions haphazardly does not achieve that,” the coalition added. “We are gratified by the court's decision today to pause these harmful actions while our case proceeds.”

The “largest and most significant challenge to Trump's authority to remake the government without congressional approval,” as the coalition called it, was filed April 28 by the organizations' legal team: Democracy Forward, Altshuler Berzon LLP, Protect Democracy, Public Rights Project, and State Democracy Defenders Fund.

Illston's decision came just hours after an emergency hearing, during which coalition attorney Danielle Leonard “said the Trump administration's vision was to fundamentally degrade the services that Congress funds agencies to carry out, raising a profound separation of powers conflict,” according to The New York Times.

As the newspaper detailed:

“There's a presumption of regularity that used to exist with respect to the government's actions that I think they need to re-earn,” she said.

Ms. Leonard said the Trump administration has never been able to point to any specific authority through which the president could seize that power from Congress. And she said that the government has consistently offered competing and contradictory explanations of why Mr. Trump can authorize the massive restructuring without Congress.

“It's an ouroboros: the snake eating its tail,” she said.

Signaling a desire to keep moving through the process swiftly, Illston gave the plaintiff coalition until next Wednesday to file a motion for a preliminary injunction, and the federal defendants — Trump along with various federal agencies and their leaders — until the following Monday to respond, with a limit of 25 pages for both.

Even if the coalition's lawsuit ultimately succeeds, Republicans have a narrow majority in both chambers of Congress, meaning Trump could potentially work with lawmakers to pursue a similar gutting of the federal government before the midterm elections.

At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.

Truthout is appealing for your support as Trump and his sycophants crack down on political speech. Nonprofits like Truthout could be caught in Trump's crosshairs as he attacks dissenting groups with bad faith lawsuits and targeted harassment of journalists.

As well, these attacks come at a time when independent journalism is most needed. The right-wing corporate takeover of media has left reliable outlets few and far between, with even fewer providing their work at no cost to the reader. Who will be there to hold the fascists to account, if not media like Truthout?

Signaling a desire to keep moving through the process swiftly, Illston gave the plaintiff coalition until next Wednesday to file a motion for a preliminary injunction, and the federal defendants — Trump along with various federal agencies and their leaders — until the following Monday to respond, with a limit of 25 pages for both.

Even if the coalition's lawsuit ultimately succeeds, Republicans have a narrow majority in both chambers of Congress, meaning Trump could potentially work with lawmakers to pursue a similar gutting of the federal government before the midterm elections.

At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.

Why would a mega bank with one of the worst reputations in a scandal-ridden industry take over a popular institution?

The United States Postal Service (USPS) is a front line in the struggle for democracy and justice against corporate power, as a memo released by Wells Fargo unveils. Published February 27, the memo outlines a plan for privatizing the USPS and enabling investors to reap the profits. The plan has been met with criticism and protest, since achieving profitability relies on selling off property, firing workers, limiting or eliminating services, and raising parcel rates by up to 140 percent. At the end of March, senators introduced a resolution calling on Congress to affirm the USPS as an independent agency and protect it against privatization.

Wells Fargo outlines challenges to implementing their plan, including that legislation needed for privatization is unlikely to pass through Congress, support for the USPS remains high especially among rural communities and investors in a privatized USPS would need to contend with “nine collective bargaining agreements with seven unions covering 550,000 employees.” But the mega bank has solutions for each of these challenges.

First, it suggests using a reconciliation bill that would only require a simple majority of votes to pass through the Senate, aggressively limiting or eliminating services to frustrate public support, and undercutting unionized labor by laying off workers and slashing benefits.

In laying out its privatization plan, the bank is returning to a previous, historical ambition: Wells Fargo was founded in 1852 by stagecoach mail delivery executives, Henry Wells and William Fargo. Wells and Fargo wanted to capitalize on the California gold rush and used stagecoaches to ship gold and deliver mail and other supplies between outposts and mining towns scattered across the state. Over the decades, Wells Fargo merged with other “pony express” mail services to monopolize delivery. The westward expansion of the railroads eventually ended the bank's reign over mail delivery, but Wells Fargo's interests in USPS remain centered on capitalization and monopolization.

Steps toward privatization may already be underway. Before resigning from his position, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy signed an agreement with Elon Musk's “Department of Government Efficiency” — the pseudo agency finding efficiencies in the federal government on the backs of public-sector workers — and announced the elimination of 10,000 jobs.

USPS took a big step toward privatization on May 9, when the USPS Board of Governors announced that FedEx official David Steiner would become the next Postmaster General. Steiner was favored by President Donald Trump to lead the agency, despite the clear conflict of interest appointing a senior executive from a USPS competitor.

It's a special kind of irony that a mega bank with one of the worst reputations in an industry where the bar is embarrassingly low wants to take over a broadly popular federal agency. The truth is, we need the USPS. We do not need Wells Fargo.

If there's a federal agency that exemplifies democracy's potential, it's the USPS. The USPS delivers to every address in the country, without exception. No matter who you are or where you live, the USPS delivers birthday cards and love letters, including to people who are incarcerated in jails and prisons. Election ballots are sent through the mail, where people make choices about who will represent their concerns in the halls of political power. Prescription medication and abortion pills are received in the mail, providing people with access to health care and reproductive justice. Tax refunds, social security and stimulus checks arrive in the mail, offering people some financial security in a volatile economy. Seeds and saplings are delivered through the mail, making the USPS a partner in environmental justice efforts. The USPS even transports insects and live animals, including honeybees and baby chicks that sustain local food and agriculture.

What's more, the USPS employs workers at competitive wages and with union representation. These wages and benefits are hallmarks of working conditions and benefits won through organized labor, where workers express their collective power and fight for dignity on the job. Postal workers earn a median wage that is higher than the national average and receive benefits like health care and paid leave. With Black employees making up 29 percent of its staff, the USPS has played an important role in building the Black middle class (perhaps a reason President Donald Trump and Musk have the agency in their crosshairs, given the administration's anti-Black and segregationist agenda). Moreover, since formal education is not required to become a postal service worker, the USPS is one of the few places where workers can earn decent pay regardless of education level.

As I've written before, we should be imagining the dismantling of Wells Fargo, not the privatizing of the USPS.

Wells Fargo is an enormously unpopular bank well-known for its scandalous business practices. On a 2023 ranking of the 100 largest publicly traded banks, factoring criteria like credit quality and profitability, Wells Fargo came in last place. Two years later, it didn't even make the list. The mega bank has been charged billions of dollars in fines and penalties from regulators for repeated wrongful and illegal practices, including foreclosing on people's homes, repossessing vehicles, and overcharging fees and interest. The bank is fodder for comedy routines and an easy target for activists and policy makers wanting to express their displeasure with the finance industry overall. 

A bank that has kicked people out of their own homes and deprived people of their livelihoods now wants to undermine the public service that delivers the mail, too. If Wells Fargo and private investors get their way, more expensive parcel rates would be only one of many concerns. One place to look for understanding just how much privatization can cost are the experiences of people who are incarcerated.

For people locked behind bars, mail and phone calls are lifelines to the outside world. But, they're expensive to get. Phone calls are especially costly, in part because these services have been monopolized by private telecommunications companies taking advantage of captive populations. In some jails and prisons, telecoms charge $1 per minute for phone calls. One 15-minute phone call can easily cost as much as $25 — an outlandish price for the human right of communicating with loved ones. In 2024, the Federal Communications Commission intervened and issued a rule cutting costs for phone calls in jails and prisons. Under the new rule, a 15-minute phone call now costs between 90 cents and $1.35.

If the USPS is privatized, we can expect private investors to raise prices on stamps and parcel rates in the same way telecoms have made their profits off people who are incarcerated. Instead of the promise to deliver to every address, your zip code will matter more than ever. Rural communities, communities of color and poor communities will likely pay the highest rates for mail delivery, since, like incarceration, residential segregation aids in identifying groups of people for exploitation.

Instead of privatizing the USPS, we should be expanding its public services. For example, the USPS can expand the financial services it already provides. The agency sells over $21 billion in money orders every year and, between 1911 and 1967, operated a popular banking system out of the nation's post offices. At its height, nearly 4 million people held $3.4 billion in interest-bearing accounts (over $50.5 billion in today's dollars). People made deposits and purchased savings bonds alongside sending and receiving mail. However, President Lyndon B. Johnson ended postal banking as sales from defense bonds waned after World War II, bank lobbyists applied pressure, and people went elsewhere for financial services.

It's certainly possible the USPS is better at offering these financial services than Wells Fargo, given the bank's massive “fake accounts” scandal, where employees, under pressure to meet aggressive sales quotas, opened bank accounts for people without their knowledge and then charged excessive fees. In fact, rather than privatization, the USPS could be expanded to operate a public banking system again — a timely idea since private banks are facing less regulatory oversight from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to rein in their costs and fees.

The USPS is an agency where struggles for democracy and justice converge. If you care about organized labor, you care about the USPS. If you care about climate change, you care about the USPS. If you care about racial, economic and reproductive justice, you care about the USPS. If you care that your grandma receives her social security check, you care about the USPS.

Wells Fargo does not care about any of these things. Don't let it privatize the USPS.

There are a few things you can do to take action and save the USPS. Sign a petition, call your senators, host a teach-in event in your community or record a video about what the USPS means to you. Tell Wells Fargo and the Trump administration to get their hands off the USPS.

At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.

Pope Leo XIV delivers the Regina Caeli prayer from the main central loggia of St. Peter's basilica at the Vatican on May 11 Vatican in his first Sunday blessing since being elected pontiff.Dan Kitwood/Getty Images

Pope Leo XIV called for a genuine and just peace in Ukraine and an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, in his first Sunday noon blessing as pontiff that featured some symbolic gestures suggesting a message of unity in a polarized Catholic Church.

“I, too, address the world's great powers by repeating the ever-present call `never again war,'” Leo said from the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica to an estimated 100,000 people below.

It was the first time that Leo had returned to the loggia since he first appeared to the world on Thursday evening following his remarkable election as pope, the first from the United States. Then, too, he delivered a message of peace.

Leo was picking up the papal tradition of offering a Sunday blessing at noon, but with some twists. Whereas his predecessors delivered the greeting from the studio window of the Apostolic Palace, off to the side of the piazza, Leo went to the very centre of the square and the heart of the church.

Part of that was logistics: He didn't have access to the papal apartments in the palace until later Sunday, when they were unsealed for the first time since Pope Francis' death.

Leo also offered a novelty by singing the Regina Caeli prayer, a Latin prayer said during the Easter season which recent popes would usually just recite and harked back to the old Latin Mass of the past.

Traditionalists and conservatives, many of whom felt alienated by Pope Francis' reforms and loose liturgical style, have been looking for gestures and substance from Leo in hopes he will work to heal the divisions that grew in the church. Some have expressed cautious optimism at the very least with a return to a traditional style that Leo exhibited on Thursday night, when he emerged for the first time wearing the formal red cape of the papacy that Francis had eschewed.

He followed up on Saturday by wearing the brocaded papal stole during a visit to a Marian sanctuary south of Rome. There, he knelt in reverence at the altar and greeted the crowd surrounded by priests in long cassocks usually favoured by conservatives.

Aldo Maria Valli, a conservative Italian journalist who writes a popular blog, said he appreciated these gestures and urged traditionalists to give Leo a chance, saying he liked a lot of what he has seen so far. “Don't shoot Leo,” he wrote.

On Sunday Leo wore the simple white cassock of the papacy and had reverted back to wearing his silver pectoral cross. He had worn a more ornate one that contains the relics of St. Augustine and his mother, St. Monica, on Thursday night that had been given to him by his Augustinian religious order.

Leo quoted Pope Francis in denouncing the number of conflicts ravaging the globe today, saying it was a “third world war in pieces.”

“I carry in my heart the sufferings of the beloved Ukrainian people,” he said. “Let everything possible be done to achieve genuine, just and lasting peace as soon as possible.”

As a bishop in Chiclayo, Peru, at the start of Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, then-Bishop Robert Prevost had not minced words in assigning blame to Moscow. According to a clip of a TV interview on the Peruvian show “Weekly Expression,” circulating in Italian media Sunday, Prevost said it was an “imperialist invasion in which Russia wants to conquer territory for reasons of power given Ukraine's strategic location.”

In his remarks Sunday, Leo also called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, and for humanitarian relief to be provided to the “exhausted civilian population and all hostages be freed.”

Leo also noted that Sunday was Mother's Day in many countries and wished all mothers, “including those in heaven” a Happy Mother's Day.

The crowd, filled with marching bands in town for a special Jubilee weekend, erupted in cheers and music as the bells of St. Peter's Basilica tolled.

Angela Gentile of Bari arrived in the square three hours early to be in place. Nonplussed that cardinals had elected yet another non-Italian pope, she said she was happy Leo came to the central balcony of the basilica, so the crowd could see him face-to-face. “What's good for the Holy Spirit works for me,” she said. “I have trust.”

More than 50 pilgrims from Houston, Texas, were in the square, too, waving three large American flags. They were in Rome on a preplanned Holy Year pilgrimage and said they were proud to be part of this historic occasion.

“Words cannot express my admiration and gratitude to God,” said the Rev. Dominic Nguyen, who led the Vietnamese American group. He said he hoped the pope would be happy to see the Stars and Stripes but also Peruvian flags and all other countries, showing the universality of the church.

Also Sunday, Leo celebrated a private Mass near the tomb of St. Peter and prayed at the tombs of several past popes in the grottoes underneath the basilica. Vatican Media filmed him praying before a mix of progressive and tradition-minded popes: Pope Paul VI, who closed out the modernizing reforms of the 1960s Second Vatican Council, and Popes Pius XII and Benedict XVI, on the more conservative end of the spectrum.

He celebrated the intimate Mass with the head of his Augustinian order and his brother, John, in the pews. In his homily, he recalled that Sunday was also the day that the Catholic Church celebrates religious vocations, and noted that the issue of declining vocations had been raised by cardinals in their pre-conclave discussions before his election.

Leo said priests can encourage more vocations by offering a good example, “living the joy of the Gospel, not discouraging others, but rather looking for ways to encourage young people to hear the voice of the Lord and to follow it and to serve in the church.”

Leo also attended the official unsealing of the papal apartments in the Apostolic Palace, which were sealed after Francis' April 21 death. It is unclear if Leo will move into the apartments or just use them for formal audiences as Francis did.

Leo has slept in his old apartment in a Vatican palazzo since his election. Francis decided to live and work at the Domus Santa Marta hotel in the Vatican rather than move into the palace, eventually taking over much of the second floor.

The 69-year-old Chicago-born missionary was elected 267th pope on Thursday. He has a busy week of audiences before his formal installation Mass next Sunday.

Truce agreement was reached after diplomacy and pressure from US but within hours there was cross-border shelling

A fragile ceasefire was holding between India and Pakistan on Sunday, after hours of overnight fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours, as US president Donald Trump said he would work to provide a solution regarding Kashmir.

The arch-rivals were involved in intense firing for four days, the worst in nearly three decades, with missiles and drones being fired at each other's military installations and dozens of people killed.

A ceasefire agreement was reached after diplomacy and pressure from the US, but within hours artillery fire was witnessed in Indian Kashmir, the centre of much of the fighting.

Blasts from air-defence systems boomed in cities near the border under blackout, similar to the previous two evenings, according to authorities, residents and Reuters witnesses.

Late on Saturday, India said Pakistan had violated the understanding to stop firing and that Indian armed forces had been instructed to “deal strongly” with any repetition.

In response, Pakistan said it was committed to the ceasefire and blamed India for the violations.

By dawn, the fighting and explosions reported overnight had died down on both sides of the border, according to Reuters witnesses.

Power was restored in most areas along India's border towns after a blackout the previous night.

Trump praised leaders of both countries for agreeing to halt the aggression.

“While not even discussed, I am going to increase trade, substantially, with both of these great nations,” he said in a post on his Truth Social platform. “Additionally, I will work with you both to see if ... a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir.”

In the border city of Amritsar, home to the Golden Temple revered by Sikhs, a siren sounded in the morning to resume normal activities brought a sense of relief and people were seen out on the roads.

The fighting started on Wednesday, two weeks after 26 men were killed in an attack targeting Hindus in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir.

“Ever since the day terrorists attacked people in Pahalgam we have been shutting our shops very early and there was an uncertainty,” said Satvir Singh Alhuwalia, 48, a shopkeeper in Amritsar. “I am happy that at least there will be no bloodshed on both sides.”

Officials in Pakistan said there was some firing in Bhimber in Pakistani-administered Kashmir overnight but nowhere else, and there were no casualties.

The two countries, born out of British colonial rule in 1947, have gone to war three times - twice over the region of Kashmir.

Hindu-majority India and Muslim Pakistan both rule part of Kashmir but claim it in full.

India blames Pakistan for an insurgency in its part of Kashmir that began in 1989 and has killed tens of thousands. It also blames Pakistani Islamist militant groups for attacks elsewhere in India.

Pakistan says it provides only moral, political and diplomatic support to Kashmiri separatists.

The combined death toll in the recent skirmishes has reached nearly 70, officials have said.

            They are considered one of the world's most dangerous, and indiscriminate, weapons. Yet five European countries have turned their backs on an international treaty on the use of landmines, citing the growing threat from Moscow.
    


            Finland, Poland, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania – which all border Russia – have made moves to pull out of the Ottawa Treaty, the agreement that bans the use of anti-personnel landmines, which are designed to kill or maim if stepped on.
    


            The developments have alarmed campaigners, who see the reintroduction of the weapons – which have killed or disfigured tens of thousands of civilians around the world and can contaminate an area for decades after a conflict ends – as a concerning regression.
    


            The treaty, which also bans the weapons' production and stockpiling, was signed in 1997, and was one of a series of agreements negotiated after the Cold War to encourage global disarmament. Since then, it has been credited with significantly reducing the harm from landmines.
    


            Responding to Finland's decision to leave the agreement, human rights NGO Amnesty International warned that the Nordic nation was endangering civilian lives, describing it as a “disturbing step backwards.”
    


            The decision “goes against decades of progress on eliminating the production, transfer and use of inherently indiscriminate weapons,” the NGO warned.
    


            At the start of this year, the pact had 165 member states. But major powers, including Russia, China, India, Pakistan and the United States, never signed up to it.
    


            In a joint statement in March, Poland and the three Baltic states announced their withdrawal, arguing for a rethink on which weapons are – and which ones are not – acceptable in the face of Russia's aggression.
    


            The countries said they needed to provide their armed forces with greater “flexibility and freedom of choice,” to help them bolster the defense of NATO's eastern flank.
    


            The following month, in April, Latvia became the first country to formally withdraw from the treaty after its parliament strongly backed the proposal, meaning that after a grace period of six months, Riga would be able to start amassing landmines again.
    


            Also that month, Finland unveiled plans to join Latvia. Explaining the decision, Finland's Prime Minister Petteri Orpo told journalists that Russia poses a long-term danger to the whole of Europe. “Withdrawing from the Ottawa Convention will give us the possibility to prepare for the changes in the security environment in a more versatile way,” he said.
    


            The announcements come as U.S. President Donald Trump has doubled down on efforts to wrap up the war in Ukraine, which has stoked fears in neighboring states that Moscow could re-arm and target them instead.
    


            Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow of the Russia and Eurasia program at the thinktank Chatham House and author of the book “Who will Defend Europe?,” believes that if and when Russia's grinding conflict in Ukraine does come to an end by whatever means, Moscow will be readying itself for its next target.
    


            “Nobody is in any doubt that Russia is looking for further means of achieving its objective in Europe,” Giles told CNN.
    


            For Giles, the military benefits of using landmines are clear. The underground explosives, he said, can slow an invasion, either by redirecting oncoming troops to areas that are easier to defend, or by holding them up as they attempt to breach the mined areas.
    


            They can be particularly beneficial for countries looking to defend themselves against an army with greater manpower. “They are a highly effective tool for augmenting the defensive forces of a country that's going to be outnumbered,” he said.
    


            He believes the five countries leaving the treaty have looked at the effectiveness of the weapons, including their use in Russia's war on Ukraine, in deterring invading forces.
    


            However, he stressed that the Western countries wouldn't use landmines in the same way as Moscow's forces, saying there were “very different design philosophies” in the manufacturing of mines and cluster munitions between countries that aren't concerned with civilian casualties or may willingly try to cause them, and those that are trying to avoid them.
    


            In Ukraine, extensive Russian minefields laid along Ukraine's southern front lines significantly slowed a summer counteroffensive launched by Ukraine in 2023.
    


            Ukraine is deemed by the United Nations to be the most heavily mined country in the world. In its most recent projections, Ukraine's government estimates that Moscow's forces have littered 174,000 square kilometers (65,637 square miles) of Ukraine's territory with landmines and explosive remnants.
    


            This means Ukrainian civilians, particularly those who have returned to areas previously on the front lines of the fighting, are faced with an ever-present risk of death.
    


            “The large-scale contamination of land by explosive ordnance has created an ‘invisible threat' in people's minds,” Humanity & Inclusion, an international charity helping those affected by poverty, conflict, and disaster, warned in a February report on the use of landmines in Ukraine. “As a result, people's movements are extremely reduced or restricted, they can no longer cultivate their land and their social, economic, or professional activities are hindered.”
    


            According to findings from Human Rights Watch published in 2023, Ukraine has also used antipersonnel landmines during the conflict and has received them from the US, despite Kyiv being a signatory of the 1997 ban.
    


            In comparison, Finland, Poland and the Baltic nations say they would remain committed to their humanitarian principles when using the explosives, despite withdrawing from the ban.
    


            When announcing its plans to leave the Ottawa Treaty, Helsinki stressed it would use the weapons in a humane manner, with the country's president Alexander Stubb writing on X, “Finland is committed to its international obligations on the responsible use of mines.”
    


            While the responsible use of landmines is a complex issue, measures to reduce civilian harm can include making precise records of minefields and their locations, educating communities to their dangers and the clearance or neutralization of the weapons once the conflict is over.
    


            Despite such pledges of responsibility, the move away from the Ottawa Treaty has left campaigners horrified.
    


            Landmines have killed or maimed tens of thousands of civilians across the world and continue to cause harm. In its 2024 report, the Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor found that at least 5,757 people were killed and wounded by mines and explosive remnants of war across the globe in 2023, with civilians making up 84% of that number.
    


            Alma Taslidžan, from Bosnia, was displaced from her homeland during the war of the early 90s,  only to return with her family to a country laced with landmines – a contamination issue she says plagues the country to this day.
    


            Now working for disability charity Humanity & Inclusion, she described the five countries' decision to pull out of the treaty as “absolute nonsense” and “the most horrible thing that could happen in the life of a treaty.”
    


            She told CNN that the arguments for banning landmines have not changed since the Ottawa Treaty was formed in the 1990s. “Once it's in the ground, it's a danger. It cannot distinguish between the foot of a civilian and the foot of a child and the foot of a soldier.”
    


            She continued, “We are surprised that such advanced militaries like the Finnish, like the Estonians, Lithuanians, Latvians, would consider putting this hugely indiscriminate weapon in their military strategy, and what is worse, putting it in their land.”
    


            Yet, for some, the new, precarious security reality that Europe is facing means that previous red lines are now up for discussion.
    


            This is the case for Giles, who sees the latest developments as a recognition from these countries that treaties on landmines were “an act of idealism which has proven to be over-optimistic by developments in the world since then.”

MOSCOW, May 11. /TASS/. Sending a delegation to Istanbul and beginning negotiations is easy to do if Kiev really wants it, Russian Presidential Aide Yury Ushakov told VGTRK journalist Pavel Zarubin in an interview.

"A proposal on negotiations without preconditions has been made. They need to come and begin negotiations. This is quite easy if they want it, of course," Ushakov said.

In his words, the level of the delegation is yet to be announced.

"As you know, we have suggested Thursday, May 15. We are ready to start in the morning. The announcement on who will head the Russian delegation will be made in the coming days," the official said.

He added that the Kremlin was waiting for Ukraine's response to the proposal.

The U.S. military service academies will soon have to certify that they make no consideration of race, ethnicity, or sex in their admissions processes and instead decide appointments by merit alone.

This policy is set to impact the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York; the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland; and the U.S. Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Advocacy groups like Students for Fair Admissions have continued to raise legal challenges to the continued use of race in service academy admissions. Thus far, these litigants have been unable to force the service academies to discontinue race-based admissions policies through legal action. Last February, the Supreme Court declined an injunction request challenging West Point's continued use of race-based factors in its admissions process.

Hegseth's order provides a new way to eliminate affirmative action policies outside of the court system.

In his memo, Hegseth wrote that a merit-based admissions process in these military service academies “ensures only the most qualified candidates are admitted, trained, and ultimately commissioned to lead the finest fighting force in history.”

“Selecting anyone but the best erodes lethality, our warfighting readiness, and undercuts the culture of excellence in our Armed Forces,” Hegseth added.

The defense secretary said the service academies may adopt a merit system that considers athletic talent, prior military service, and student performance at a service academy preparatory school.

In March, the Naval Academy announced it would no longer consider race as a factor in its admissions process.

The Military Academy and the Air Force Academy followed suit in April, announcing they would also stop considering race as a factor in admissions decisions. All three service academies made these announcements while requesting reprieve from ongoing challenges brought by Students for Fair Admissions.

"There is no point in prolonging the killings. And I will wait for Putin on Thursday in Turkey," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

This week, the world watched in anticipation for Russia's Victory Day parade after President Volodymyr Zelensky commented that he could not guarantee the safety of those attending. Meanwhile, the European Union moves one step forward to banning Russian gas from the European continent. It is also revealed this week that U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has fallen out of step with the White House.

"(Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin... doesn't want to have a ceasefire agreement with Ukraine, but rather wants to meet on Thursday, in Turkey, to negotiate a possible end to the bloodbath. Ukraine should agree to this, immediately," U.S. President Donald Trump said.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will travel to  to Antalya, Turkey, for a NATO foreign ministers' meeting from May 14–16, where he is expected to address the war in Ukraine and push for stronger Allied defense commitments.

Preliminary findings suggest that one of the men killed the other before taking his own life. 

Western leaders dismissed the Kremlin's proposal for talks in Istanbul on May 15 as insufficient.

The Kremlin said the leaders held a detailed discussion about the Russian initiative and Erdogan expressed full support, reiterating Turkey's readiness to provide a venue and assist in organizing the negotiations.

Erdogan told Macron that international cooperation is critical for initiating peace negotiations and the "sensitive implementation" of Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction processes, the Turkish Presidency reported.

The pope said he was praying to God to grant the world the "miracle of peace."

Ushakov's comments follow Russian President Vladimir Putin's May 11 invitation for direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul starting May 15.

The assault began around 2 a.m. on May 11, with Russian forces deploying 108 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy UAVs from multiple directions, Ukraine's Air Force said.

Zelensky called a ceasefire the essential first step toward ending the war.

The number includes 1,310 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

"Think of the hundreds of thousands of lives that will be saved as this never ending 'bloodbath' hopefully comes to an end... I will continue to work with both sides to make sure that it happens." 

"An unconditional ceasefire is not preceded by negotiations," French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters on May 11. 

U.S. President Donald Trump's Special Envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, relied on translators from the Kremlin in his meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, NBC News reported on May 10, citing a U.S. official and two Western officials with knowledge of the talks.

Witkoff, who has emerged as Trump's de facto personal envoy to Russian President Vladimir Putin, has met with the Russian president several times in recent months. His most recent visit took place in Moscow on April 26, the day after a mass missile attack killed 12 people in Kyiv. 

Witkoff — a real estate tycoon who does not speak Russian — did not employ his own interpreter during these meetings, officials told NBC News. The decision represented a breach of typical protocols and rendered him dependent on Kremlin-provided translators. 

"If they speak to each other in Russian, he doesn't know what they are saying," one Western official said. 

Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, called Witkoff's refusal to use his own interpreter "a very bad idea."

"I speak Russian and have listened to Kremlin interpreters and U.S. interpreters at the same meeting, and the language is never the same," McFaul told NBC News via email.

Witkoff's conduct in high-profile negotiations has been previously called into question. The New York Post reported on April 30 that his approach caused concern among White House officials, with sources citing his use of Kremlin translators as one problematic choice.  

One source described Witkoff as a "nice guy, but a bumbling f***ing idiot."

In a statement provided to NBC NEws, White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said that Witkoff "abides by all security protocols in coordination with the State Department."

U.S. President Donald Trump has increasingly expressed frustration with his inability to secure a ceasefire in Russia's war against Ukraine. While his administration has sought warmer ties with Moscow, Trump backed Ukraine and Europe's proposal for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire beginning March 12 and said he would impose tougher sanctions against Russia if Putin refused. 

Putin did not agree to the proposal. In remarks on May 11, he instead invited Ukraine to begin direct negotiations in Istanbul on May 15. Russia has consistently refused to accept an unconditional ceasefire in its full-scale war against Ukraine.

            • China trade talks: Top US officials touted “substantial progress” and indicated a deal may have been made with China during negotiations this weekend in Switzerland, after President Donald Trump's tariffs sparked a trade war between the world's largest economies.
    


            • Ukraine peace effort: President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was ready to meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin this week, shortly after Trump urged him to accept Moscow's invitation for direct peace talks in Turkey. Zelensky repeated calls for a ceasefire starting tomorrow, but did not specify if that would be a precondition for the talks.
    


            • Luxe new Air Force One: During Trump's trip to the Middle East this week, his administration is expected to accept a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family to be retrofitted and used as Air Force One, sources told CNN, in an unprecedented move that raises major ethical and legal questions.
    


            National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett reiterated comments from recent days that the United States has “about 24 trade deals” in the works.
    


            Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are working together on the deals, Hassett said today on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo.”
    


            The discussions are an effort to solidify deals during President Donald Trump's 90-day pause on his so-called reciprocal tariffs.
    


                    “(The trade deals) all look a little bit like the UK deal, but each one is bespoke,” Hassett said, referring to a broad agreement struck with British negotiators last week. “Each one's a little bit different because different countries have different things that they've been doing wrong to us, different things they care a lot about.” 
                





            Hassett did not specify which countries the United States may have deals with.
    


            On Friday, he told CNBC that about 24 deals “are this close to being resolved” and the deals are “going to be very settling for markets.”
    


            Hassett spoke with Bartiromo shortly before Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emerged from negotiations with Chinese officials in Geneva to report “substantial progress” on a potential deal with Beijing.
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he is prepared to meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin for talks in Turkey this week, in what would be their first meeting since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion.
    


            Zelensky said a “full and lasting ceasefire” starting Monday would provide “the necessary basis for diplomacy,” but did not specify that this would be a precondition for attending the talks.
    


                    “We await a full and lasting ceasefire, starting from tomorrow, to provide the necessary basis for diplomacy. There is no point in prolonging the killings,” Zelensky wrote today on X. “And I will be waiting for Putin in Türkiye on Thursday. Personally. I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses.”
                





How we got here: Zelensky's message came less than an hour after US President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social that Ukraine should “immediately” agree to meet with Russian officials on Thursday.
    


            Trump's comments undermined efforts by Kyiv's European allies to pressure Putin with an ultimatum: agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine by Monday or face “massive” new sanctions.
    


            European leaders have been steadfast this weekend in demanding that Putin agree to the ceasefire before any direct talks take place. The Russian leader has ignored the ultimatum, instead proposing the direct talks in Turkey.
    


            If the talks took place, it would mark the first meeting between Putin and Zelensky since 2019.
    


            President Donald Trump is urging Ukraine to accept an invitation from Russia to meet for direct peace talks in Turkey on Thursday, without the condition of first agreeing to a 30-day ceasefire.
    


                    “President Putin of Russia doesn't want to have a Cease Fire Agreement with Ukraine, but rather wants to meet on Thursday, in Turkey, to negotiate a possible end to the BLOODBATH,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Ukraine should agree to this, IMMEDIATELY. At least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible, and if it is not, European leaders, and the U.S., will know where everything stands, and can proceed accordingly!”
                





            Trump added that he's “starting to doubt” Ukraine will make a deal with Putin.
    


Key context: While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he stands “ready to meet” with Putin, he and Kyiv's allies want Moscow to first agree to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by the US.
    


            The leaders of France, Britain, Germany, Poland and Ukraine met in Kyiv on Saturday to send that ultimatum to Putin. Trump, meanwhile, has increasingly engaged in the Ukraine peace efforts on a separate track from his traditional European allies.
    


            In a late-night address Saturday, Putin did not acknowledge the ceasefire offer. Instead, he proposed holding the direct talks with Kyiv in Turkey — something not seen since the early weeks of Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022.
    


            European leaders were quick to publicly reject Putin's counter-offer, and Keith Kellogg — Trump's special envoy to Ukraine — had indicated he was aligned with the Europeans before Trump spoke out today on social media.
    


            The Trump administration is set to accept a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family, which will be retrofitted and used as Air Force One during his second term, two people familiar with the agreement told CNN.
    


            The announcement is expected to happen within a matter of days. Trump embarks this week on the first major foreign trip of his second term, which will includes a stop in Doha.
    


            Given the massive value of a Boeing 747-8, the move is unprecedented and raises substantive ethical and legal questions.
    


            A Qatari official said the plane is technically being gifted from the Qatari Ministry of Defense to the Pentagon, describing it more as a government-to-government transaction instead of a personal one. The Defense Department will then retrofit the plane to the president's use with security features and modifications.
    


            Trump and aides toured the plane earlier this year in Palm Beach, and it is expected to be in use within two years, one person told CNN. Since his tour, Trump has boasted to people around him about how luxurious the plane was.
    


            This comes after the president was deeply frustrated by delays in new aircraft to be used as Air Force One. He at one point tasked Elon Musk with helping accelerate the process.
    


            Top US officials involved in high-level trade negotiations with China emerged from two days of talks touting “substantial progress” and appearing to confirm that a deal between the two countries had been reached, which could have massive implications for the global economy.
    


            “I'm happy to report that we've made substantial progress between the United States and China in the very important trade talks,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a brief statement today in Geneva, where the talks were held, calling the talks “productive.”
    


            US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer indicated an agreement had been reached after President Donald Trump imposed sweeping 145% tariffs on most Chinese goods last month.
    


                    “The president declared a national emergency and imposed tariffs, and we're confident that the deal we struck with our Chinese partners will help us to resolve work toward resolving that national emergency,” Greer said.
                





            “It's important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as maybe thought,” he added.
    


            CNN has asked the Treasury Department for clarification on the deal, though Bessent said details will be shared tomorrow morning. Ahead of the talks, Trump administration officials had downplayed expectations that a deal would be reached this weekend.
    


            “These are very tough negotiators,” Greer said of his Chinese counterparts, saying the group “worked very diligently” and the last two days were “very constructive.”
    


            Bessent said he and Jamieson have briefed Trump, who he described as “fully informed.”
    


            They did not take questions from reporters.
    


            Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has denied cuts made by the Department of Government Efficiency have impacted air safety.
    


            Air traffic controllers were not included in the DOGE cuts earlier this year, but some staff who maintain infrastructure for the Federal Aviation Administration were.
    


            Duffy said on NBC's “Meet the Press” today that while there was a “broader conversation about which positions are going to be preserved,” he was never asked to cut air traffic controllers, who have long been in short supply.
    


            He also emphasized that the FAA cuts were made to probationary workers. “It was the new employees that we were gonna let go. Many of them have come back,” Duffy said.
    


Air safety in the US: The transportation secretary was asked to address safety concerns at Newark Airport, where air traffic controllers face critical staffing shortages and repeat equipment outages — including the loss of radar for about 90 seconds on Friday, and more equipment issues that ground flights to a halt this morning.
    


            Pressed on whether it's safe to fly in the US, Duffy told NBC the country still has the “safest air space for sure,” emphasizing that flying remains safer than other methods of transportation.
    


            The transportation secretary did, however, acknowledge that he's concerned about the state of the nation's air travel infrastructure. He touted his three-year reconstruction plan to vastly upgrade the country's networks and equipment, and added that he plans to offer 20% up front bonuses to air traffic controllers to help refill the ranks.

            Today's high-stakes nuclear talks between US and Iranian officials in Oman have concluded, a senior Trump administration official said, casting the latest discussions as encouraging.
    


            Led by President Donald Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, the fourth round of talks lasted more than three hours and took place both directly and through Omani moderators, the official said.
    


            In a positive sign ahead of Trump's first major trip of his second term to the Middle East, the two sides plan to “move forward” on more technical topics soon, according to the official, though a date has not yet been set.
    


            “We are encouraged by today's outcome and look forward to our next meeting, which will happen in the near future,” the official said.
    


                    For its part, Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei described the talks as “difficult but useful to better understand each other's positions and to find reasonable & realistic ways to address the differences.” 
                





The big picture: It remains unclear what kind of deal the two sides could reach, whether and how much uranium the US will allow Iran to enrich, and how a potential deal could be different from the deal reached by the Obama administration.
    


            Trump told reporters Wednesday that a decision on whether Iran can have a nuclear enrichment program has not yet been made.
    


This post has been updated with comments from Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson.



            Secretary of State Marco Rubio will travel to the Middle East this week, joining President Donald Trump in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, according to the State Department.
    


            Rubio will then travel to Turkey to attend the NATO Informal Foreign Ministers Meeting on Wednesday through Friday.
    


About the trip: Trump's travel to the Middle East this week marks the first major foreign trip of his second term.
    


            The president's top priority is to reach “economic agreements” with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates that would enhance their investments in the US, according to Trump administration sources.
    


            Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, his former chief Middle East negotiator, have also been privately plotting the more ambitious goal of expanding the Abraham Accords, the treaties negotiated during Trump's first term between several Arab Nations and Israel, the sources said.
    


CNN's Alayna Treene and Kristen Holmes contributed to this report.



            President Donald Trump said there was “great progress made” in the trade talks that began yesterday between the United States and China, signaling a possible thaw in the trade war sparked by his massive tariffs.
    


            “A very good meeting today with China, in Switzerland. Many things discussed, much agreed to. A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner. We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
    


            It was the first public comment from Trump after the day of talks in Geneva, which will continue today, according to a source briefed on the meetings.
    


Setting expectations: Trump's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is leading the US delegation, urged the public earlier this week not to expect a major trade deal out of the meetings, instead characterizing them as an opportunity to establish a constructive tone and agree on some basic principles.
    


            Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua called the Switzerland talks “an important step toward resolving the issue.”
    


            “However, an ultimate solution requires sufficient strategic patience and determination, as well as the just support of the international community,” Xinhua said.
    


How we got here: The US has placed a minimum 145% tariff on most Chinese imports, and China has responded with a 125% tariff on most US imports. As a result, trade between the two sides is falling sharply, according to logistics experts.
    


            Even reducing that tariff rate by half might not be enough to change trade levels significantly. Economists have said 50% is the make-or-break threshold for the return of somewhat normal business between the two countries. And the combination of fewer goods arriving in the US and increased costs on imports that do arrive has already started pushing up prices for Americans.
    


            Hours after Bessent set off for Switzerland on Friday, Trump floated the possibility of slashing tariffs on Chinese goods to 80% while demanding China “open up its market to USA.”
    


            A fourth round of talks between the US and Iran on Tehran's nuclear program has begun in Oman today, according to Iranian state media, with the two sides aiming to overcome divisions that could dash the tentative negotiations.
    


            The talks, held indirectly and mediated by the Omani foreign minister, are aimed at addressing Tehran's nuclear program and lifting sanctions.
    


            That they are happening at all is something of a breakthrough — the talks are the highest-level in years — but signs of firm progress are slim.
    


Each side is drawing a line: Both countries have expressed a willingness to resolve their disputes through diplomacy, but a central issue remains Iran's demand to continue enriching uranium for its nuclear program, which it insists is peaceful.
    


            The US has called uranium enrichment a “red line.”
    


            President Donald Trump, who is headed to the Middle East next week, has threatened that the US would resort to military strikes against Iranian nuclear sites, with Israel's help, should Tehran fail to reach a deal with its interlocutors.
    


            Iranian officials told CNN yesterday that recent talks with the US were “not genuine” from the American side. The Iranian source also reiterated that allowing uranium enrichment on Iranian soil is Iran's “definite red line” in the negotiations.
    


            US special envoy Steve Witkoff, who has been heading the American side, warned that if this session of talks were not productive, “then they won't continue and we'll have to take a different route.”

            Top US officials involved in high-level trade negotiations with China emerged from two days of talks touting “substantial progress” and appearing to confirm that a deal between the two countries had been reached, which could have massive implications for the global economy.

Trump's presidency: US officials tout progress in China trade talks



            CNN has asked the Treasury Department for clarification on the deal, though Bessent said details will be shared Monday morning. Ahead of the talks, Trump administration officials downplayed expectations that a deal would be reached this weekend, characterizing the meetings as a good first step. Bessent had suggested last week that his goal was de-escalation of tensions, as the US and China have been at a virtual stalemate since Trump imposed his tariff policy.
    


            “These are very tough negotiators,” Greer said of his Chinese counterparts, saying the group “worked very diligently” and the last two days were “very constructive.”
    


            Bessent said he and Greer, who did not take questions from the press, have briefed Trump, who he described as “fully informed.”
    


            Trump indicated ahead of the talks that he was willing to lower the tariff rate on China to 80%, saying in a post to social media that it was “up to Scott B.,” referring to Bessent. The White House later clarified that China also needed to make concessions.
    


            The weekend talks marked a significant step toward thawing US-China trade relations.
    


            The current 145% tariff rate has sent shipments from China into the United States plunging by 60%, according to Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, a logistics and freight forwarding broker.
    


            Even reducing that tariff rate by half might not be enough to change trade levels significantly. Economists have said 50% is the make-or-break threshold for the return of somewhat normal business between the two countries.
    


            The combination of fewer goods coming in and increased costs on imports that do arrive has already started pushing up prices for Americans. Goldman Sachs analysts said Thursday that a key measure of inflation would effectively double to 4% by the year's end because of Trump's trade war.
    


            And with ships carrying goods under the 145% tariffs now coming into port, a trade deal wouldn't lower prices immediately.

            To say Americans depend on a wide range of Chinese goods understates how pervasive those goods have become in all our lives. Footwear, clothes, appliances, microchips, baby goods, toys, sports equipment, office machine parts and much more all pour into the United States from China in staggering numbers.
    


            But now those imports are decreasing. Imports into the United States during the second half of 2025 are expected to fall at least 20% year over year, according to the National Retail Federation. The decline from China will be even starker: JPMorgan expects a 75% to 80% drop in imports from there.
    


            The trade war has already affected the US economy. The nation's gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the US economy, showed America's first quarterly contraction since early 2022, as importers raced to bring in goods before punishing tariff rates kicked in.
    


            The impact of the sky-high tariffs is also being felt keenly in China, whose exports to the US fell sharply in April. Chinese outbound shipments to the US stood at $33 billion last month — a whopping 21% decline from the $41.8 billion recorded in April 2024, according to CNN's calculation.
    


            Steep US tariffs also took a heavy toll on China's manufacturing sector. Chinese factory activity contracted at its fastest pace in 16 months in April, adding urgency to Beijing's efforts to roll out fresh economic stimulus.
    


            The news that Bessent and Greer would meet their Chinese counterparts in Geneva raised hopes of a thaw between the two nations. The US and China are the world's largest and second-largest economies, respectively, bigger than even the next 20 economies put together, according to World Bank data.
    


            Trump also told a conservative radio host on Wednesday that he would raise the case of jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai “as part of the negotiation.” Lai, a pugnacious former publisher whose now-shuttered tabloid Apple Daily was a regular thorn in Beijing's side, is in the midst of a national security trial that could send him to prison for life.
    


            It's unclear whether US officials brought up Lai in talks with their Chinese counterparts.

President Donald Trump's new presidential plane could be flying in the skies soon as his administration is set to accept a super luxury Boeing jet as a gift from Qatar. 

In February, Trump revealed the White House was looking at a number of alternative options to replace dated Air Force One jets, including “getting” a used aircraft from overseas and converting it to become his presidential airplane. The president criticized Boeing, whose contract to construct a pair of Air Force One replacement jets fell far behind schedule and went over budget after multiple setbacks. 

Qatar is expected to give the plane to the president as a gift this week when he visits the country, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates on the first major foreign trip of his second term, ABC News reported.

The Justice Department has already concluded that accepting the jet would not violate the Constitution's prohibition of any U.S. government official accepting gifts “from any King, Prince or foreign State,” per the outlet, because “the gift is not conditioned on any official act, [thus] it does not constitute bribery.” The DOJ additionally argued that since Qatar is technically giving the plane to the United States Air Force and it will eventually be given to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation, the $400 million gift is “legally permissible.” 

However, that didn't stop some Democrats from criticizing the deal, with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) specifically targeting the fact that Trump “gets to keep the plane.”

“This isn't a good idea even if the plane was being donated to the U.S. government,” Murphy wrote on X. “But Trump GETS TO KEEP THE PLANE??? It's simply a cash payment to Trump in exchange for favors. Just wildly illegal.”

Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) called on the House Oversight Committee to “aggressively investigate now.”

Trump toured the plane that was once used by the Qatari royal government in February while it was parked at the West Palm Beach International Airport in Florida. 

Afterward, the president kept details about plans to acquire the jet scant, telling reporters he was unhappy that Boeing was taking so long to finish the promised Air Force One replacements. 

TRUMP ASKS TO REFURBISH QATARI PLANE FOR INTERIM AIR FORCE ONE WHILE BOEING PROGRESS LAGS

 “I'm not happy with the fact that it's taking so long, and we may do something else,” he said. “We may go and buy a plane or get a plane or something.”

Earlier this month, further specifics were revealed when the White House reportedly commissioned defense company L3Harris to refurbish Qatar's Boeing 747.

            • Ceasefire holds: A ceasefire between India and Pakistan appears to be holding on Sunday despite accusations of violations by both sides. Explosions rocked several parts of Kashmir hours after the truce was announced on Saturday, but both countries have reiterated their commitment to the agreement.
    


            • Overnight diplomacy: US President Donald Trump said a night of talks mediated by Washington helped secure the deal, after the White House received alarming intelligence on the conflict, according to US sources. Trump says he's “proud” of the US role bringing the fighting to an end — although India has downplayed US involvement in the talks.
    


            • Kashmir massacre: Tensions ratcheted up between the neighboring states after a massacre of tourists last month in Indian-controlled Kashmir. India blamed Pakistan for the attack and launched “Operation Sindoor” Wednesday in both Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Islamabad has denied involvement in the killings.
    


            • Long-running conflict: Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan each control parts of Kashmir but claim it in full and have fought three wars over the territory.
    


Our live coverage of the conflict between India and Pakistan has wrapped up for the day.

            India's military says it downed “a few” Pakistani aircraft during its conflict with Islamabad, although it says it couldn't give exact numbers as the wreckage of the planes had fallen outside India's border.
    


            “Their planes were prevented from coming inside our border so we do not have the wreckage with us but definitely we have downed a few planes,” India's Director General of Military Operations (DMGO) Rajiv Ghai said in a briefing Sunday.
    


            He said that the country's military are still exploring the “technical details.”
    


            Ghai added that the Pakistan army is reported to have lost approximately 35 to 40 personnel in artillery and small arms firing on the Line of Control (LoC) – the de facto border separating Indian- and Pakistan-administered Kashmir – between the 7th and 10th of May.
    


            India lost five military personnel, he said.
    


            According to Ghai, “over 100 terrorists were killed by Indian operations.”
    


            CNN cannot verify the claims. Pakistan has previously claimed to have shot down five Indian jets.
    


            In Pakistan-administered Kashmir, locals who have endured restless nights along the Line of Control (LoC) – a flashpoint area in the recent hostilities between Islamabad and New Delhi – remain skeptical about the ceasefire which on Saturday brought an abrupt end to the conflict.
    


            Mian Mehboob ul Hassan, a resident of Leepa Valley on the Line of Control (LoC), told CNN that India had a “bad track record” of sticking to ceasefires in the past.
    


            However, he welcomed the cessation in hostilities and said it offered both sides a “privilege.”
    


            Farooq Haider Khan, the former prime minister of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, similarly said he believed the truce would only be temporary. He told CNN that India had not respected ceasefires in previous conflicts.
    


            Despite accusations of violations from both sides, the truce announced Saturday appears to be holding.
    


            After initial accusations of violations, a ceasefire between India and Pakistan appears to be holding on Sunday.
    


            Pakistan's foreign ministry late on Saturday local time said the country “remains committed” to upholding the truce, while an Indian defense source told CNN Sunday that the air force's operational readiness remains high.
    


Here are the latest developments: 



Pope Leo XIV welcomed the ceasefire between India and Pakistan in his first Sunday address, which also saw him appeal for peace in Ukraine and Gaza.
    


                    “I welcomed the announcement of the ceasefire between India and Pakistan and I hope that through negotiations we can reach a lasting agreement,” he said.
                





            Also during his “message of peace” to the huge crowds gathered St. Peter's Square, the new pope called for peace in Ukraine, as well as a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages. He called for humanitarian aid to be provided “to the exhausted population” in Gaza.
    


            India's military action against Pakistan has sent a bold message to terrorists, India's defense minister said Sunday.
    


            Addressing an event on Sunday, Defense Minister Rajnath Singh said that the terrorists who had killed 26 people in Indian-administered Kashmir last month and “erased the sindoor of many families had now been brought to justice.”
    


            The word ‘sindoor' is a reference to the red vermilion, or powder, that many Hindu women wear on their foreheads after marriage and is a symbolic nod to the killings in April, which left several women widowed.
    


            Singh said that India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, had sent a clear message that India will carry out “impactful action” against terrorism, “whether it is on this side of the border or across the border.”
    


            The 26 killed at a scenic mountain spot in Indian-administered Kashmir were mostly Indian tourists. India blamed the attack on Pakistan-based terrorists. Islamabad denied the accusation. The attack served as the trigger for India to launch its military action – dubbed “Operation Sindoor” – against Pakistan.
    


            After launching its first strikes against Islamabad on Wednesday, New Delhi said it was targeting “terrorist infrastructure” in the country. It later also acknowledged targeting Pakistani military infrastructure.
    


            The Indian Air Force said Sunday that its military operation against Pakistan had been “successfully executed” but was “still ongoing.”
    


            An Indian defense source told CNN Sunday that the air force's operational readiness is still high despite the ceasefire announced on Saturday.
    


                    “The Indian Air Force (IAF) has successfully executed its assigned tasks in Operation Sindoor, with precision and professionalism,” the statement said, referring to the name given to the operation.
                





            “Since the Operations are still ongoing, a detailed briefing will be conducted in due course.”
    


            Since the truce came into effect on Saturday at 5pm Indian time (730a ET) both sides have accused each other of ceasefire violations.
    


            India's foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, told a news conference on Saturday that there had been “repeated violations” of the agreement.
    


            There have been no fresh strikes or drone flights reported in Pakistan Sunday.
    


            Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said Sunday that it appreciated the constructive role played by the US and other friendly states “in supporting the recent ceasefire understanding between Pakistan and India, a step towards de-escalation and regional stability.”
    


            Residents of Indian-administered Kashmir say they are relieved and happy that India and Pakistan have reached a ceasefire agreement, and are assessing the damage caused by days of tit-for-tat strikes.
    


                    “When we heard of the ceasefire through the news, we were so happy!” said a 21-year-old student from the town of Uri, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) east of the de-facto border known as the Line of Control.
                





            “People are coming back to the village… there is hope finally that things will be better,” the student, who asked not to be named, told CNN.
    


            A 30-year-old resident, who lives near the town of Kupwara in India-administered Kashmir and also asked not to be named, said “people are out and about, smoking, discussing the politics between India and Pakistan.”
    


            “One day ago, people thought they would leave their homes and the next day we have this news. We are very happy and hopeful,” the resident said.
    


            Video showed markets reopening and people walking through the streets of several towns in India-administered Kashmir.
    


            Mohammed Tahir, a resident of Srinagar in India-administered Kashmir, told CNN the ceasefire “offers a window for stability” and that he hopes it holds.
    


            “Otherwise the current calm risks being a temporary respite,” he said.
    


            Deepika Pushkar Nath, a lawyer from Jammu, told CNN that on Saturday “everything was shut down and no-one was moving out, markets were closed.”
    


            Then people saw President Trump's post that there was a ceasefire and there was relief, Nath said. Some people felt that the war was ending too soon and India should have continued to fight, he said, but others were happy to return to their normal lives.
    


            Even so, Nath added: “There is also a lingering anger, people are asking why Pakistan is celebrating. Did we lose?”
    


            A key water-sharing pact between India and Pakistan remains suspended, a source within India's foreign ministry told CNN, despite the two countries reaching a ceasefire agreement on Saturday.
    


            India suspended its involvement in the Indus Water Treaty days after last month's deadly massacre of tourists in India-administered Kashmir. It has been in force since 1960 and is regarded as a rare diplomatic success story between the two fractious neighbors.
    


            “There is no pre- or post-condition of the ceasefire. The call was initiated from Pakistan. The Indus Water Treaty will remain in abeyance,” the source told CNN.
    


            The treaty governs the sharing of water from the enormous Indus River system, a vital resource supporting hundreds of millions of livelihoods across Pakistan and northern India. The Indus originates in Tibet and flows through China and India-controlled Kashmir before reaching Pakistan.
    


            Islamabad has called any attempt to stop or divert water belonging to Pakistan an “act of war.”
    


            On Sunday, Pakistan's defense minister told Geo News that the water treaty was among its top priorities in discussions with India, as well as disputed Kashmir and “terrorism.”
    


            CNN has reached out to Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for further comment.
    


This post has been updated with additional information. 



            US President Donald Trump said he is “proud” that Washington was able to help India and Pakistan reach an immediate ceasefire, and said he would increase trade “substantially” with both countries.
    


            “I am very proud of the strong and unwavering powerful leadership of India and Pakistan for having the strength, wisdom and fortitude to fully know and understand that it was time to stop the current aggression,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social late Saturday.
    


                    “I am proud that the USA was able to help you arrive at this historic and heroic decision,” he wrote.
                





            India has downplayed US involvement, with its Ministry of Information saying the agreement was worked out “directly between the two countries,” but Pakistani officials have heaped praise on Washington.
    


            “We thank President Trump for his leadership and proactive role for peace in the region,” said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday.
    


            In his post, Trump went on to say: “While not even discussed, I am going to increase trade, substantially, with both of these great Nations.”
    


            And he pledged to see if a solution could be reached on the Kashmir dispute, writing: “I will work with you both to see if, after a ‘thousand years,' a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir.”
    


            China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke with top officials from India and Pakistan on Saturday, shortly before a ceasefire was reached between Islamabad and New Delhi to bring an end to the dangerous spiral of tit-for-tat strikes, Beijing's foreign ministry said.
    


            Speaking separately with Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, Wang emphasized China's support for an immediate ceasefire and stressed the need to adhere to it to prevent further conflict, according to readouts from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
    


            China, a neighbor to both India and Pakistan, has urged the countries to avoid further escalating a conflict that would threaten regional stability, and to resolve their differences through dialogue.
    


            “The current international situation is complex and turbulent, and the peace and stability of Asia are hard-won and should be treasured,” Wang told Doval, China's readout said.
    


            In a separate call, Dar thanked China for its mediation efforts aimed at achieving a ceasefire and expressed a desire to maintain close communication with China, according to a readout from Pakistan's foreign ministry.
    


            Pakistan and India agreed to an immediate ceasefire later Saturday, unexpectedly halting the spiral of retaliatory military operations triggered by last month's massacre of tourists in Pahalgam in India-administered Kashmir.
    


            Pakistan is observing an Islamic day of thanksgiving on Sunday, after the government agreed to an immediate ceasefire with India in the wake of tit-for-tat strikes that appeared to be spiraling out of control.
    


            The day, known as “Youm-e-Tashakur” in Urdu, is being observed to offer gratitude to Allah, pay tribute to the armed forces, and celebrate national unity, according to a statement released by the prime minister's office.
    


            “'Operation Bunyan Marsus' gave an effective and comprehensive reply to the enemy's aggression,” the statement said, referring to the military operation which Pakistan launched Sunday, after it said India targeted multiple military bases.
    


            In remarks delivered Saturday, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the nation's forces “made military history” in their fight against India, and expressed gratitude to the country's allies in helping to establish a truce.
    


            Pakistan's foreign ministry late on Saturday local time said the country “remains committed to a faithful implementation of the ceasefire” announced with India earlier in the day, amid accusations of ceasefire violations from both sides.
    


            The foreign ministry statement accused India of committing violations of the truce “in some areas,” without giving specific details, but said Pakistan's armed forces handled the situation with “responsibility and restraint.”
    


            Pakistan said it believed that any issues in implementing the ceasefire should be addressed through communication at the “appropriate levels” and urged troops on the ground to exercise discretion.
    


            Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said his forces “made military history” in their fight against India after the two sides reached a ceasefire agreement on Saturday.
    


            In a televised address late Saturday night local time, the leader did not address reports of explosions in Kashmir or respond to allegations from India's foreign secretary, who accused Pakistan of violating the countries' nascent truce.
    


            Instead, he focused on applauding Pakistan's military response and expressing gratitude for his country's allies.
    


                    “In recent days what the enemy has done was shameful and cowardly. Our brave army in a spectacular fashion made military history,” Sharif said, adding, “In a few hours our jets silenced India's guns in a way that history will not soon forget.”
                





            Sharif thanked US President Donald Trump for mediating the ceasefire talks, after a day in which Islamabad and New Delhi diverged in describing the significance of Washington's role in securing the truce.
    


            Sharif also thanked the leaders of China, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Qatar and the United Kingdom for their efforts in helping establish the ceasefire.
    


            “Our forces have been rewarded with the most magnificent honor and pride,” Sharif said as he thanked Pakistan's military leadership.
    


            A top Pakistani government official rejected Indian claims that Pakistan had violated a ceasefire with India.
    


            “Violation of ceasefire agreement from our side is out of question,” Pakistan's Information Minister Attaullah Tarar told Pakistani news channel Geo News.
    


            “The people of Pakistan were celebrating their victory against India,” Tarar said.
    


            India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri accused Pakistan of repeatedly violating the ceasefire agreement on Saturday, after explosions were heard in both the India- and Pakistan-administered parts of Kashmir.
    


            “For the last few hours there have been repeated violations of the understanding arrived at earlier this evening between the directors general of military operations of India and Pakistan,” Misri said in a televised address Saturday night.
    


                    “This is a breach of the understanding arrived at earlier today. The armed forces are giving an adequate and appropriate response and take very serious notice of these violations,” he said.
                





            Misri said India is calling on Pakistan to take “appropriate steps to address these violations and deal with the situation with seriousness and responsibility.” He added that India's military has been instructed to “deal strongly” with violations of the ceasefire along the border and the Line of Control in Kashmir.
    


            Pakistan has not yet publicly responded to Misri's allegations. Pakistan's prime minister is scheduled to speak late this evening local time.
    


            The sounds of multiple explosions were heard over Pakistan-administered Kashmir early Saturday evening local time.
    


            In videos shared with CNN from the Bhimber district, dozens of explosions can be heard reverberating through the sky in rapid bursts. The videos also appear to show specks of light, possibly projectiles flying through the air.
    


            A local government source told CNN that the explosions were attacks from the Indian side of the Line of Control, the mutually agreed upon ceasefire line in Kashmir.
    


            CNN is unable to verify these claims and has reached out to the Pakistan and Indian militaries for comment.
    


Here's the view on the ground, from a video obtained by CNN:



Explosions on the Indian side: This comes after blasts rocked Srinagar in India-administered Kashmir earlier Saturday.  Witnesses and at least one Indian government official in Kashmir and the border states of Punjab and Gujarat also reported drone sightings and the sound of nearby explosions.
    


CNN's Esha Mitra contributed reporting to this post.



            Pakistan is prepared to engage in “constructive diplomacy” with India, the country's foreign ministry said today, adding that it wants to resolve all issues “including the Jammu and Kashmir Dispute, through peaceful means.”
    


            The lengthy written statement — issued in the hours after a ceasefire had been agreed between India and Pakistan — sought to explain and clarify Islamabad's actions and motivations in recent days.
    


                    “Despite facing blatant Indian aggression and persistent provocations, Pakistan exercised great restraint. However, it was constrained to respond to ensure the safety and security of its people,” according to the statement.
                





            The ministry also said Pakistan is calling on the international community to play its part in preventing any further escalations between the two nuclear-armed states.
    


            A core group of top US officials — including Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State and interim national security adviser Marco Rubio and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles — had been closely monitoring the escalating conflict between India and Pakistan when on Friday morning, the US received alarming intelligence, Trump administration officials told CNN.
    


            While they declined to describe the nature of the information, citing its sensitivity, they said it was critical in persuading the three officials that the US should escalate its involvement.
    


            Vance himself would call Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
    


Behind the scenes: Vance briefed President Donald Trump on the plan, then spoke with Modi at noon eastern time on Friday, making clear to the Indian prime minister that the White House believed there was a high probability for dramatic escalation as the conflict went into the weekend, the administration officials said. Vance encouraged Modi to have his country communicate with Pakistan directly and to consider options available for de-escalation, the officials said.
    


            At that point, the officials said, the US believed the two sides were not talking, and they needed to get them back to the bargaining table. Vance also outlined to Modi a potential off-ramp that the US understood the Pakistanis would be amenable to, the officials said, though they did not offer details.
    


            Following the call, State Department officials, including Rubio, began working the phones with their counterparts in India and Pakistan through the night, the sources said.
    


            The Trump administration was not involved in helping draft the agreement, the administration officials said, and viewed their role mostly as getting the two sides together to talk. But from the US perspective, Vance's call to Modi was a critical moment.
    


            Strong blasts were heard across the city of Srinagar in India-administered Kashmir just hours after a ceasefire was announced between India and Pakistan.
    


            “What the hell just happened to the ceasefire? Explosions heard across Srinagar,” Omar Abdullah, chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, said in a post on X.
    


            A CNN stringer reported a host of explosions on Saturday evening local time followed by a blackout. The cause of the blasts was not immediately clear.
    


The explosions can be heard in this video posted by Abdullah:



            The India-Pakistan conflict was taking a dramatic turn for the worse, pitching the nuclear-armed neighbors into a dangerous spiral of tit-for-tat strikes.
    


            Then, out of the blue, President Donald Trump on Saturday said the US had brokered an end to the fighting. On his Truth Social platform, he made the surprise announcement that India and Pakistan had agreed to a “full and immediate” ceasefire — all the more unexpected as, just days before, Vice President JD Vance insisted the conflict was “fundamentally, none of our business.”
    


            But escalating attacks deep inside Indian and Pakistani territory seem to have focused minds. Just hours before, India had struck Pakistani military bases, provoking a furious retaliation from Pakistan, which launched rockets, artillery and drone strikes on dozens of locations in India.
    


            There are conflicting accounts of how the ceasefire was negotiated. While Islamabad praised US involvement, New Delhi downplayed it, saying the neighbors had worked together “directly” on the truce.
    


            Whatever the US role was exactly, the White House was probably pushing on an open door. It is in neither India's nor Pakistan's interest for the conflict, sparked by a terror attack in disputed Kashmir last month, to continue.
    


            The truce is also exactly the kind of quick deal Trump hoped he could secure elsewhere, such as in Ukraine, where conflict has been dragging on for nearly three and a half years. In comparison, the most recently intensified fighting between India and Pakistan seems to be over after just three and a half days.
    


            US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that the ceasefire reached between India and Pakistan was a result of several conversations between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance over the past 48 hours between top officials in each country.
    


            “It was a beautiful partnership,” Bruce said on News Nation. “This was the result of the Vice President JD Vance, of course, this entire government moving through the vision and implementing the insight and vision of President Trump along with of course, my guy, Secretary of State Marco Rubio.”
    


What India and Pakistan say: India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, however, did not mention US involvement when announcing the agreement, and an Indian statement said the deal was worked out “directly” between the two countries. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump claimed this morning that the ceasefire was brokered by the US.
    


            But a Pakistani government source familiar with the negotiations told CNN that the US — and Rubio in particular — played a crucial role in getting both sides to agree.
    


                    “It's been a long 48 hours, but this is the point of what we do,” Bruce continued. “Multiple phone calls at multiple levels with each government were had, certainly with the prime ministers over this period of time. Back-and-forth conversations and both, again JD Vance, our vice president, and the secretary of state clearly making a difference.”
                





            “We look forward to hopefully managing more conversations and having this endure,” she added.
    


            Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked US President Donald Trump for his role in brokering a ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan, as the two countries offer differing accounts on Washington's involvement in the talks.
    


            “We thank President Trump for his leadership and proactive role for peace in the region,” Sharif wrote on X, about three hours after Trump first announced the ceasefire.
    


                    “Pakistan appreciates the United States for facilitating this outcome, which we have accepted in the interest of regional peace and stability,” Sharif said, adding that Saturday's agreement could beckon “a new beginning” for peace in the region.
                





            Sharif also thanked Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio for their “valuable contributions.”
    


            Since the ceasefire was announced, the Indian government has downplayed the US' reported efforts, while Pakistani officials have amplified them.
    


            After an intense day of fighting that threatened to spiral out of control, India and Pakistan unexpectedly agreed to an immediate ceasefire, halting the worst fighting in decades between the nuclear-armed neighbors.
    


            Although the United States has claimed credit for the agreement, questions remain about how it was reached — and whether it will last.
    


Here are the latest developments:



            As a ceasefire was announced between India and Pakistan on Saturday, President Donald Trump hailed the role of the United States in mediating, and Pakistan praised it — but India downplayed it.
    


            In their long history of tensions, India and Pakistan have both viewed foreign intervention differently:
    


            “India has never accepted mediation in any dispute, be it India-Pakistan or India-China, or any other,” according to Aparna Pande, research fellow for India and South Asia at the Hudson Institute.
    


                    “So yes, India welcomes international pressure on Pakistan, but it will never state that there was a role by any other country or international organization,” she said.
                





            “Pakistan, on the other hand, has always sought international mediation, so they will praise it,” she added, saying it is “the only way it can put pressure on India to discuss and resolve the Kashmir dispute.”
    


Some context on Kashmir: The territory has been a flashpoint in India-Pakistan relations since both gained their independence from Britain in 1947.
    


            The ruler of Kashmir initially decided to remain independent, choosing not to become a part of either Pakistan or India. After militants from Pakistan invaded, he signed a letter acceding to India. Pakistan did not recognize the letter as a legal document, sparking war. In 1949, the two countries agree to withdraw all troops behind a mutually agreed ceasefire line, later known as the Line of Control.
    


            To this day, both India and Pakistan claim Kashmir in full and have fought multiple wars over it.
    


            A Pakistani government source familiar with the negotiations that led to a truce with India said that the United States played a crucial role in them.
    


            The agreement came after an intense day of fighting that left both sides fearing the tit-for-tat strikes could spiral out of control, the source told CNN, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
    


Shock over strikes: The source said both sides were progressing toward an agreement on Friday, but said that Islamabad was blindsided by New Delhi's targeting three Pakistani air bases with air-to-surface missiles early Saturday morning local time.
    


            Pakistan's government believed that a diplomatic off-ramp had been close and was shocked by the strikes, the source said.
    


            In response, Pakistan fired back a much bigger salvo that targeted air bases in India, as well as military targets near the line of control in the disputed Kashmir region. “An eye for an eye,” the Pakistani military said in a statement Saturday morning.
    


            The source said that New Delhi had been shocked by the scale of Pakistan's response, and that both sides then “got serious” about engaging in peace talks later Saturday.
    


            Even as the talks kicked into high gear, the source said India fired more rockets, with Pakistan responding. But US assurances meant that the talks continued, the source added.
    


US steps in: US Secretary of State Marco Rubio played a “monumental role” in mediating the discussions, according to the source, who said that officials from Saudi Arabia and Turkey were also involved.
    


            By mid-afternoon, neither side had launched fresh strikes. Two hours later, the ceasefire was announced, the source said.
    


            The source was not sure how Rubio convinced India to agree to the deal. Indian officials have, however, downplayed the influence of US officials in brokering the agreement, with a source saying the truce was worked out “directly” with Pakistan.
    


            UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy hailed the ceasefire announced by India and Pakistan as “hugely welcome.”
    


            “I urge both parties to sustain this. De-escalation is in everybody's interest,” he added in a post on X.
    


            Meanwhile, the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Issues Kaja Kallas said the announced ceasefire “is a vital step toward de-escalation.”
    


            She added: “All efforts must be made to ensure it is respected.”
    


            Pakistan has fully reopened its airspace for all fights across the country, following a ceasefire announcement between Pakistan and India.
    


            A spokesperson for Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) earlier said the country had closed its airspace to all air traffic — including civilian flights — starting at 3:15 a.m. local time on Saturday (6:15 p.m. Friday ET) until noon local time.
    


            The ceasefire between India and Pakistan was agreed to “directly” between the two countries, India's Ministry of External Affairs said Saturday, echoing what a source on the Indian side told CNN earlier.
    


            The statement, which was shared on social media by the Indian government, comes despite US President Donald Trump's announcement that the ceasefire was the result of a night of US mediation.
    


            According to the Indian statement, an agreement was reached after Pakistan's director general of military operations initiated a phone call Saturday afternoon local time.
    


                    “The stoppage of firing and military action between India and Pakistan was worked out directly between the two countries,” reads the statement, which was shared by India's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.
                





            An Indian source had previously provided the same statement to CNN.
    


On potential future talks: The Indian government also said there had been no decision reached to hold talks “on any other issue at any other place.”
    


            A readout from the US State Department had said Secretary of State Marco Rubio offered help to mediate “in order to avoid future conflicts,” and Rubio wrote on X that the two sides had agreed to “start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.”
    


            India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri has also said that the directors general of military operations of the two countries are scheduled to speak again on Monday.
    


What Islamabad is saying: Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said in an X post shortly after Trump's announcement that “Pakistan and India have agreed to a ceasefire with immediate effect.” Rubio held a call with Dar as well.
    


This post has been updated to reflect a statement from the Indian government and additional comments from Rubio.



            India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri confirmed India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire, which came into effect starting at 5 p.m. local time (7:30 a.m. ET).
    


            During a news conference, Misri said that Pakistan's Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) held a phone call with his Indian counterpart earlier on Saturday afternoon local time. During the call, it was agreed that both sides “would stop all firing and military action” from 5 p.m. Indian Standard Time.
    


            Misri added that the directors general of the two countries are scheduled to speak again on Monday.
    


            India said an “understanding” was reached between New Delhi and Islamabad to stop the military action that had erupted between the two neighbors, according to sources on the Indian side.
    


            “The stoppage of firing and military action between India and Pakistan was worked out directly between the two countries,” a source said.
    


            They continued that Pakistan's director general of military operations (DGMO) initiated a call on Saturday afternoon local time, “after which discussions took place and understanding reached.”
    


            “There is no decision to hold talks on any other issue at any other place,” the source added.
    


            US President Donald Trump announced earlier on his Truth Social platform that the two sides had agreed to a “full and immediate ceasefire,” which was confirmed by Pakistan's foreign minister on X minutes later.
    


            Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said that Pakistan and India have agreed to a ceasefire “with immediate effect,” confirming US President Donald Trump's announcement on his Truth Social platform.
    


            “Pakistan has always strived for peace and security in the region, without compromising on its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Dar added, in a post on X.
    


            The surprise ceasefire announcement came after India and Pakistan continued to accuse the other of strikes overnight into Saturday.
    


            US Vice President JD Vance, who just days ago claimed the conflict between India and Pakistan was “none of our business,” has also shared President Donald Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed countries.
    


            In an interview with Fox News on Thursday, Vance had downplayed the potential for US influence as the India-Pakistan conflict spiraled.
    


            “What we can do is try to encourage these folks to deescalate a little bit, but we're not going to get involved in the middle of war that's fundamentally none of our business and has nothing to do with America's ability to control it,” Vance told Fox News on Thursday.
    


            “You know, America can't tell the Indians to lay down their arms. We can't tell the Pakistanis to lay down their arms. And so, we're going to continue to pursue this thing through diplomatic channels,” Vance said.
    


            Vance shared a screenshot of Trump's Truth Social post announcing the ceasefire on Saturday, but did not immediately provide further comment.
    


            Pakistan's foreign minister and Indian sources confirmed the halt in fighting shortly after Trump's surprise announcement.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio says India and Pakistan showed “prudence” in agreeing to a ceasefire after a spate of deadly attacks against each other that brought them close to a broader conflict.
    


            “I am pleased to announce the Governments of India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire and to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site,” Rubio wrote Saturday on X, minutes after President Donald Trump first announced the ceasefire with a post on Truth Social.
    


            Rubio praised Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Shehbaz Sharif for “their wisdom, prudence, and statesmanship in choosing the path of peace.”
    


            Earlier Saturday, Rubio spoke with the foreign ministers of both countries, the State Department said.
    


            Pakistan has confirmed the truce but there has been no comment yet from India.
    


            India and Pakistan have agreed to a “full and immediate ceasefire” following a night of talks mediated by the US, President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Saturday.
    


            “After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE,” the US president said.
    


            “Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence.”
    


            Neither side has commented yet on Trump's statement - we'll bring you the latest as we get it.
    


            Pakistan's Prime Minister said that retaliatory strikes against India on Saturday had specifically targeted military infrastructure New Delhi had used to launch its earlier attacks in “a powerful and well-coordinated response.”
    


            Earlier Saturday, Pakistan's military said it launched an operation against India, in retaliation to India launching missiles at key military bases, including one close to the capital Islamabad.Hours later, explosions were reported in India-administered Kashmir, including Srinagar, the region's largest city, and the city of Jammu.
    


            The cause of the blasts was not immediately clear.
    


            Pakistan launched the strikes on Saturday as part of ‘Operation Banyan al-Marsous,' Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif said in a statement issued by his office.
    


            Sharif said Pakistan had on Saturday given “a powerful and well-coordinated response to India's unprovoked aggression,” and accused India of launching “missile and drone attacks on Pakistan, targeting Noor Khan Airbase and other locations early this morning, killing innocent civilians.”
    


                    “Today, we have delivered a resounding reply and avenged the blood of the innocent,” Sharif said. “We are proud of our armed forces.”
                





            The information minister for Pakistan-administered Kashmir said that 11 people were killed, including a child, and 56 others were injured in “intense” overnight Indian shelling along the Line of Control (LoC).
    


            “Last night, intense shelling from the Indian side took place at more than five different locations along the Line of Control,” Pir Mazhar Saeed Shah said Saturday.
    


                    “As a result, 11 people, including a child and four women, lost their lives, and 56 others were injured.”
                





            He continued that, so far, 1,014 people have been relocated from the LoC – the de-facto border separating the India- and Pakistan-administered parts of the disputed territory that has been a flashpoint in the recent hostilities – to safer areas.
    


            In Pakistan-administered Kashmir, Indian shelling has damaged 235 homes, 29 of which have been completely destroyed, Shah said. He added that two small hospitals along the LoC were also targeted by Indian shelling, causing partial structural damage to the buildings.
    


            The latest confrontation between India and Pakistan continued Saturday, with Islamabad launching a military operation in retaliation to what it said were Indian strikes on its military bases overnight. India's military said it “effectively countered and responded” to Pakistan's operation.
    


            Witnesses have recounted the moment blasts were heard in Srinagar, India-controlled Kashmir's largest city, on Saturday morning.
    


            Explosions were reported in India-administered Kashmir, including Srinagar, the region's largest city, and the city of Jammu, on Saturday morning. The cause of the blasts was not immediately clear.
    


            Local residents living near the city's airport told CNN they heard multiple blasts in their vicinity. A Reuters witness reported that the explosions were heard near the city's airport and the local army headquarters.
    


                    “I heard sounds of three blasts one after the other from the airport. This happened around noon. I was at my home with family when we heard all this and were caught off guard,” 28-year-old Rafique Ahmed, who lives close to the airport, told CNN. 
                





            Ahmed continued, “Earlier in the morning, I had heard around 5:45 a.m. there were sounds of blasts as well. There were sirens that followed these explosions.”
    


            “We are staying inside our house to be safe. Let's see what happens.”
    


            Another witness, Madeeha, who lives just over a mile from the airport, said, “I heard these blasting sounds early morning around 5:45 a.m. first and then around noon as well around.”
    


                    Madeeha continued, “We all got frightened this morning. We rushed down to the ground floor to stay there. Based on our own experience we know that we need to rush to the lower floors for security reasons, as the higher floors are more likely to get hit.”
                





            India's military said Pakistan's retaliatory military operation against India targeted “places of worship” including a Hindu temple.
    


            “Multiple armed drones have been sent through the night, endangering civilians and religious sites,” India's defense ministry wrote in a statement on X.
    


            One of the places targeted was the Shambhu Temple, a popular religious site in Jammu city in India-administered Kashmir. Residential areas in Jammu were also targeted, the statement said.
    


            Early Saturday, Pakistan said it launched an operation against India, in retaliation to India launching missiles at key military bases, including one close to the capital Islamabad.
    


            Explosions were reported in India-administered Kashmir, including Srinagar, the region's largest city, and the city of Jammu.
    


            Indian officials confirmed the death of at least one person on Saturday as a result of Pakistan's military operations.
    


            The Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir confirmed a government official, district development commissioner Raj Kumar Thappa, was killed in shelling on the city of Rajouri in India-administered Kashmir.
    


            “I've no words to express my shock & sadness at this terrible loss of life. May his soul rest in peace,” Minister Omar Abdullah wrote in a post on X.
    


            India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri also confirmed Thappa's death, telling reporters in a news conference that his death added “to the civilian casualties and the damage in that state.”
    


            Pakistan and India launched retaliatory military operations on each other on Saturday, escalating the conflict further, after days of accusing each other of taking escalatory steps.
    


            Islamabad said early Saturday it had launched an operation against India, in retaliation to India launching missiles at key military bases. Pakistan said its air defenses had intercepted most of India's missiles.
    


            Later, India's Wing Commander Vyomika Singh said Pakistan “targeted civilian areas and military infrastructure,” including medical and educational buildings in India-administered Kashmir, while speaking during the news briefing alongside other senior officials.
    


            Pakistan has not responded to comments made during the news briefing.
    


            The weeks-long confrontation between India and Pakistan escalated further on Saturday, with Islamabad launching a military operation in retaliation to what it said were Indian strikes on its military bases overnight.
    


            The nuclear-armed neighbors are now locked in their most expansive military conflict in decades, even as the international community calls for calm and restraint.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has offered Washington's help in mediating amid the escalations.
    


            Here's what to know about the latest exchanges:
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio offered US mediation in the escalating conflict between Pakistan and India while speaking separately with his counterparts in both countries, according to State Department readouts.
    


            Rubio spoke with India's External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar in separate calls, during which he “emphasized that both sides need to identify methods to de-escalate and re-establish direct communication to avoid miscalculation,” according to the readouts.
    


            He also spoke earlier with Pakistani army chief Asim Munir, during which he “continued to urge both parties to find ways” to de-escalate.
    


            The secretary of state offered US help to mediate “in order to avoid future conflicts,” the readout said.
    


            This is the first such offer of US assistance mentioned in readouts of his calls with Pakistani or Indian officials.
    


            Pakistan's foreign minister said Saturday that if India stops its escalatory actions, so will Islamabad.
    


            “If there is an iota of sanity, India will stop and if they stop, so will we,” Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on camera while speaking with a local TV station.
    


                    “We genuinely want peace without the hegemony of any one country,” Dar said.
                





            His comments come after India and Pakistan launched a fresh round of military operations on each other on Saturday and accused each other of taking escalatory steps.
    


            India says it “effectively countered and responded” to Pakistan's military operation early Saturday.
    


            Pakistan “targeted civilian areas and military infrastructure,” including medical and educational buildings in India-administered Kashmir, Wing Commander Vyomika Singh alleged, during a media briefing in New Delhi alongside other senior officials.
    


            “Air intrusions and several harassment attacks were attempted” at more than 26 locations along India's international border and the de facto border dividing Kasmhir between Indian and Pakistani control, Singh said.
    


            Pakistan's military “also resorted to air intrusions using drones and firing of heavy caliber weapons” along the disputed border in Kashmir, Singh said. She added Pakistan used a high-speed missile to target an air base in Punjab state, inside India's undisputed borders.
    


            The Indian army “responded effectively,” causing “extensive damage” to Pakistan army infrastructure. Singh said the Indian side sustained “limited damage.”
    


            Pakistan's military “has been observed to be moving its troops towards forward areas, indicating an offensive intent to further escalation,” the Indian commander said. “Indian armed forces remain in a high state of operational readiness, and all hostile actions have been effectively countered and responded proportionately.”
    


            Pakistan has not responded to comments made during the news briefing.
    


            Earlier, Pakistan said it launched a retaliatory operation against India after India launched strikes on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, against what it called “terrorist infrastructure.”
    


            No questions were taken during the news briefing.
    


This post has been updated with additional information.



            China said it is “deeply concerned” about escalating tensions between India and Pakistan, and vowed to play a “constructive role” in de-escalation.
    


            “China is closely following the current situation between India and Pakistan and is deeply concerned about the escalation,” a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday.
    


            “We strongly urge both sides to prioritize the broader interest of peace and stability, remain calm and restrained, and return to the path of political resolution through peaceful means,” the spokesperson added.
    


                    “Avoiding further escalation is in the fundamental interests of both India and Pakistan, conducive to regional peace and stability, and aligns with the expectations of the international community. China stands ready to continue playing a constructive role in this regard.”
                





Some context: China, which borders both India and Pakistan, has repeatedly called for calm and restraint amid the looming risk of war on its doorstep. Its Foreign Ministry expressed regret and concern on Wednesday after India launched strikes on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, against what it called “terrorist infrastructure.”
    


            Late last month, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi expressed support for Pakistan in a phone call with his counterpart, calling China an “ironclad friend” of Pakistan's.
    


            Pakistan is Beijing's “all-weather strategic partner” and a key participant in Chinese leader Xi Jinping's signature global infrastructure project, the Belt and Road Initiative. China is Pakistan's primary arms supplier, accounting for 81% of the country's weapons imports over the past five years.
    


            The International Monetary Fund's executive board on Friday approved an approximately $1 billion loan disbursement to Pakistan, a relief for the country facing a lingering economic crisis and now an escalating conflict with India.
    


            The immediate disbursement comes as part of a $7 billion bailout Pakistan secured from the IMF after years of negotiations, according to a statement.
    


            The IMF also approved a new $1.4 billion under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility, its climate resilience fund — but those funds will not be released yet.
    


            While Pakistan had long been working to secure this deal, India asked the IMF for a broader review of its loans to Islamabad earlier this month, as the conflict heightened.
    


Delhi's objection: India said it raised concerns at the IMF meeting Friday about “the possibility of misuse of debt financing funds for state sponsored cross border terrorism,” according to a press release from the Indian Ministry of Finance.
    


Some context: The loan disbursement comes as Pakistan's economy has been suffering major challenges in recent years, including a debt crisis and economic turmoil as a result of political instability and climate catastrophes. A military stand-off with India would threaten any progress.
    


            “Sustained escalation in tensions with India would likely weigh on Pakistan's growth and hamper the government's ongoing fiscal consolidation, setting back Pakistan's progress in achieving macroeconomic stability,” credit agency Moody's said in a report earlier this week, according to the Reuters news agency.
    


            “A persistent increase in tensions could also impair Pakistan's access to external financing and pressure its foreign-exchange reserves,” it added.
    


            The escalating conflict between India and Pakistan has reached “alarming proportions,” one analyst has said, after Islamabad said it launched an operation against its neighbor in retaliation to recent “Indian aggression.”
    


            “This crisis has reached alarming proportions,” said Washington-based South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman, adding there seem to be “no immediate off-ramps in site.”
    


            Pakistan's military said early Saturday it had launched an operation against India in retaliation to India launching missiles at key military bases, including one close to the capital Islamabad.
    


            The rapid escalation of conflict between the neighboring states was sparked by a massacre of tourists last month in India-controlled Kashmir.
    


            India and Pakistan have already fought three wars over Kashmir, a contested region they both claim in its entirety, with each controlling a part. Another conflict could have catastrophic consequences.
    


                    “Each round of tit-for-tat strikes takes India and Pakistan further up the escalation ladder, but neither side appears willing to claim victory and call it a day,” said Kugelman.
                





            “The escalation dynamics are extremely concerning here.”
    


            Explosions have been reported in India-administered Kashmir, hours after Pakistan said it launched a retaliatory military operation against its neighbor.
    


            At least two blasts were heard early Saturday in Srinagar, the largest city in India-administered Kashmir, a journalist on the ground told CNN.
    


            The sound of explosions was also heard in the city of Jammu, a resident and former top police official for India-controlled Kashmir, Shesh Paul Vaid, told the Associated Press.
    


            The cause of the blasts was not immediately clear.
    


            The Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir on Friday night appealed to people in and around the city of Jammu to stay at home.
    


                    “It's my earnest appeal to everyone in & around Jammu please stay off the streets, stay at home or at the nearest place you can comfortably stay at for the next few hours,” Omar Abdullah wrote on X.
                





            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Pakistani army chief Asim Munir on Friday and offered US mediation, according to a State Department readout.
    


            Rubio “continued to urge both parties to find ways to deescalate,” the readout said, adding that he offered US assistance “in starting constructive talks in order to avoid future conflicts.”
    


            This is the first such offer of US assistance mentioned in readouts of his calls with Pakistani or Indian officials.
    


            India is currently responding to Pakistani attacks, an Indian official with knowledge of the matter told CNN's Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Matthew Chance.
    


            “All Pakistani attacks are being responded to appropriately by the Indian Armed Forces,” the official said.
    


            The Pakistani military said early Saturday it had begun an operation against India in retaliation against recent “Indian aggression,” saying
    


            India had launched missiles at key military bases
    


            .
    


            Pakistan's military claims it has hit multiple targets in India and India-administered Kashmir.
    


            Here are some Indian military targets they say they have struck:
    


            Most of these locations are near or along the de facto border that divides the disputed Kashmir region between New Delhi and Islamabad. Pathankot, in Punjab state, and Suratgarh, in Rajasthan state, are airfields inside India's undisputed borders.
    


            The Pakistan military said that, in an “eye for eye” retaliation, they targeted the Indian air bases that were used to launch missiles against Pakistan.
    


            CNN cannot independently verify Pakistan's claim regarding India's strikes. CNN has reached out to India's Ministry of Defense and the Indian Air Force for a response.
    


            The Pakistani military said it launched an operation against India on Saturday morning in retaliation to recent “Indian aggression.”
    


            The announcement came shortly after Pakistan said India had attacked several of its military air bases. Right after Pakistan made this claim, its government posted on X to say that “India must now prepare for Pakistan's response.”

Airspace closure: Pakistan closed its airspace to all air traffic on Saturday, according to a Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) spokesperson. The closure, which started at 3:15 a.m. local time (6.15 p.m. Friday EST), will apply to all civilian flights in the country until noon local time Saturday.
    


Kashmir has been a flashpoint in India-Pakistan relations since both gained their independence from Britain in 1947. The two nations to emerge from the bloody partition of British India — Muslim-majority Pakistan and Hindu-majority India — both claim Kashmir in full, and months after becoming independent, fought their first of three wars over the territory.
    


Here's a quick recap:



1947: India and Pakistan gain independence from Britain. The ruler of Kashmir initially decides to remain independent, choosing not to become a part of either Pakistan or India. After militants from Pakistan invade, he signs a letter acceding to India. Pakistan does not recognize the letter as a legal document, sparking war. In 1949, the two countries agree to withdraw all troops behind a mutually agreed ceasefire line, later known as the Line of Control.
    


1965: India and Pakistan go to war again over Kashmir. The clash did not resolve the dispute over the territory.
    


1971: This was the biggest war fought between the two countries, which led to a humiliating loss for Pakistan and the creation of the state of Bangladesh from the region formerly known as East Pakistan.
    


1999: India and Pakistan fight a limited border conflict in Kashmir, after armed invaders from Pakistan cross the Line of Control in the town of Kargil.
    


            India on Wednesday said it launched a military operation against Pakistan, hitting “terrorist infrastructure” in both Pakistan and Pakistan administered-Kashmir, in a major escalation of tensions between the two neighbors and in response to an attack on tourists in India-administered Kashmir on April 22.
    


Here's what you need to know about the attack in Kashmir:



What happened: Gunmen opened fire on tourists in a popular travel destination in the mountainous destination of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. At least 25 Indian citizens and one Nepali national were killed in the massacre, which unfolded in a valley only accessible by foot or on horseback. Eyewitnesses described scenes of horror as the gunmen approached, opening fire on people from close range. Some recalled how the men among the group were singled out and shot at. Other survivors told local media the gunmen accused some of the victims of supporting India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
    


Who claimed responsibility: Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front (TRF), claimed responsibility for the attack on social media but it has reportedly since walked back that claim, according to multiple local media reports. Pakistan has denied involvement. India has not publicly blamed any group for the attack but has justified its retaliatory moves as a response to Pakistan's alleged “support for cross-border terrorism.”
    


Some background: India has long accused Pakistan of harboring Islamist militant groups that target Kashmir, something Islamabad denies. Attacks by militants have in the past led to a sharp escalation of tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, both of whom have rival claims to the Himalayan region. India conducted air strikes inside Pakistan in 2019 following an insurgent attack on Indian soldiers.
    


            Kashmir has been a flashpoint in India-Pakistan relations since both gained their independence from Britain in 1947.
    


            The two nations to emerge from the bloody partition of British India both claim Kashmir in full, and months after becoming independent, fought their first of three wars over the territory.
    


            The divided region is now one of the most militarized places in the world.
    


            For decades, several domestic militant groups, demanding either independence for Kashmir or for the area to become part of Pakistan, have fought Indian security forces, leaving tens of thousands killed in the violence.
    


            But attacks on tourists in the picturesque Himalayan region are rare.
    


            Tensions between India and Pakistan over Kashmir have surged in recent years, after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government revoked its constitutional autonomy in 2019, bringing it under the direct control of New Delhi.
    


            By the numbers, India's military would be seen as superior to Pakistan's in any conventional conflict.
    


            The Indian defense budget is more than nine times Pakistan's, according to this year's edition of “The Military Balance,” an assessment of armed forces by the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
    


            That budget supports an active-duty Indian force of almost 1.5 million personnel, compared to 660,000 for Pakistan.
    


On the ground, India's 1.2 million-strong army has 3,750 main battle tanks and more than 10,000 artillery pieces, while Pakistan's tank force is only two-thirds of India's and Islamabad has fewer than half of the artillery pieces in New Delhi's arsenal.
    


At sea, the Indian navy's advantage is overwhelming. It has two aircraft carriers, 12 guided-missile destroyers, 11 guided-missile frigates and 16 attack submarines.
    


            Pakistan has no carriers and no guided-missile destroyers, with 11 smaller guided-missile frigates being the backbone of its naval fleet. It also has only half the number of subs that India fields.
    


            Both air forces rely heavily on older Soviet-era aircraft, including MiG-21s in India and the Chinese equivalent – the J-7 – in Pakistan.
    


            India has been investing in multirole French-made Rafale jets, with 36 now in service, according to “The Military Balance.”
    


            Pakistan has added Chinese J-10 multirole jets, with more than 20 now in its fleet.
    


            Though Pakistan still has dozens of US-made F-16 fighters, the backbone of its fleet has become the JF-17, a joint project with China that came online in the early 2000s. About 150 are in service.
    


            Russian-made aircraft play a significant role in India's air fleet, with more than 100 MiG-29 fighters in service with the air force and navy combined, plus over 260 Su-30 ground attack jets.
    


            The rivals are closer in capabilities when it comes to nuclear forces, with around five dozen surface-to-surface launchers each, though Indian has longer-range ballistic missiles than Pakistan.

            Mónica got pregnant last year around the same time President Donald Trump was elected to a second term. And that is when her race against the calendar began.
    


            The Venezuelan national, who is in the United States legally but with temporary status, is terrified that Trump's long-promised effort to curb birthright citizenship will be allowed to take effect before her baby boy is due in August – an outcome that could effectively leave him stateless.
    


            “There's been a lot of fear,” the South Carolinian told CNN. “Every day it's a new restriction, and we don't know what will happen.”
    


            Mónica asked to be identified in this story by her first name because she is concerned about possible repercussions for speaking publicly about her situation.
    


            When the Supreme Court gathers Thursday to hear oral argument in a high-profile emergency appeal involving Trump's birthright citizenship order, the justices will technically be considering a procedural question about whether lower courts overstepped their authority by blocking the president's efforts nationwide. But the court's answer to that question will have enormous on-the-ground consequences, even for people – like Mónica – who are in the United States legally.
    


            Allowing the administration to temporarily enforce the order Trump signed on his first day of his second term could set up a dynamic in which a baby born in New Jersey would be able to access a passport or obtain a Social Security number, but a child born into the same circumstances across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania could not.

Four questions in the Supreme Court arguments in birthright citizenship cases



            Or the court could rule in a way that allows Trump to enforce the order against all but a handful of individuals.
    


            For nearly 150 years, courts have understood the 14th Amendment's text to guarantee citizenship to anyone “born or naturalized in the United States,” regardless of the immigration status of their parents. In a landmark 1898 decision, US v. Wong Kim Ark, the Supreme Court affirmed the idea that people born in the United States – in that case, the son of Chinese immigrants – were entitled to US citizenship, with a few narrow exceptions.
    


            But a small group of legal conservatives have for years focused on a second phrase in the amendment's text, requiring people to be “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States before they become entitled to citizenship. People who owe their allegiance to another country, the argument goes, are not covered. Trump often chafed against birthright citizenship during his first term and campaigned heavily on the idea of ending it if he returned to power.
    


            Those arguments will not be before the Supreme Court this week, but the absence of a question on the merits raises a thorny practical question for the justices: How much should they take the broader constitutional issues into account if they decide to allow Trump to enforce a policy – even temporarily – that flies in the face of a long-standing recognition that a person born in the United States, regardless of their parents' immigration status, is entitled to citizenship?
    


            “As a practical matter, I think the merits will to some degree have to be in the back of their minds,” said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University and close observer of the Supreme Court. “It's hard for anyone – probably even including a Supreme Court justice – to totally put those arguments aside in a situation like this.”
    


            Mónica, who is in her 30s, and her husband fled Venezuela because her family worked for the opposition to the country's authoritarian government of Nicolás Maduro. She came to the United States in 2019 and benefits from a form of humanitarian relief known as temporary protected status.
    


            The Trump administration has moved to end TPS for Venezuelan nationals, and the Supreme Court is considering a separate emergency appeal on the process it used to do so.
    


            Trump's executive order, signed on January 20, blocks federal agencies from issuing documents recognizing citizenship for people born to noncitizen parents but also people in the country on a temporary basis. Multiple federal courts blocked its implementation nationwide, including one judge in Seattle nominated by President Ronald Reagan who described Trump's effort as “blatantly unconstitutional.”



            A challenge for Mónica is that there would be no realistic way for her to secure Venezuelan citizenship for her son if he was unable to obtain a US passport. Maduro cut diplomatic ties with the United States in 2019. Even if she could reach an embassy in another country, Mónica said she wouldn't apply for a citizenship from a government her family is attempting to escape.
    


            “We left fleeing persecution,” Mónica said through an interpreter. “It would be a risk to make him a Venezuelan citizen because we're actively seeking asylum from the Venezuelan government.”
    


            In an unusual quirk of the case, Mónica will likely ultimately be able to obtain US citizenship for her son because she belongs to the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, a membership organization for people seeking asylum. The Trump administration has said in court papers it wants to enforce the order on a temporary basis against everyone except for certain members of ASAP, which is also representing Mónica, and another group.
    


            By the time the underlying case over birthright citizenship is resolved, Mónica's child will likely be walking.
    


            Meny, a native of Honduras who came to the United States with her husband and son in 2021, is in the same position. Her second son is due in July.
    


            “I was already pregnant when I started to hear rumors that the president would likely be taking away birthright citizenship,” said Meny, a California resident who also asked to be identified by her first name only. “I remember thinking it was so scary that my son had not yet been born and that his rights would be violated.”
    


            Meny, who is seeking asylum in the United States, said she is concerned about the conversation she might need to have with her son someday about his status.
    


            “As a mom – as a parent – it would be very difficult for me to explain to him why he doesn't have those rights,” she said.
    


            The difference between what's technically at issue in the case and the practical implications of the ruling have allowed groups on both sides to frame the emergency appeal in their own terms. The administration has focused almost exclusively on the separation of powers and what it sees as the courts' encroachment into the executive branch. Immigration groups, meanwhile, have warned the Supreme Court of “chaos” and say a ruling for Trump could “fundamentally fracture the country.”
    


            Trump has asked the Supreme Court not to lift the lower court orders blocking enforcement entirely, but rather to limit those orders to the states and individuals who originally sued. That could mean blocking its enforcement in 22 blue states or, possibly, against a handful of individuals. As a backup argument, the administration has urged the Supreme Court to at least allow it to plan for implementing the order at some point in the future. Anyone outside of those states or group of individuals then could be subject to enforcement.
    


            The administration has described that as a “modest” request.
    


            “Years of experience have shown that the executive branch cannot properly perform its functions if any judge anywhere can enjoin every presidential action everywhere,” the Department of Justice told the Supreme Court in March.
    


            Such a decision, if it offered further guidance or limitations on when district court judges could universally block a policy or law could have ramifications far beyond birthright citizenship.
    


            GianCarlo Canaparo, a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, noted that presidents of both parties – and both liberal and conservative justices – have raised concerns in recent years about the number of orders from federal judges that enjoin enforcement of a policy against not only the people who sued but everyone else in the nation. Those orders, known as nationwide or universal injunctions, have become common during the second Trump administration.
    


            Canaparo said he was unpersuaded by arguments that a uniform approach to citizenship in all states might supply a good reason for a nationwide injunction in this case.
    


            “The argument that we need uniform laws is a policy judgment,” he said, “which is just historically not a permissible basis for courts to be granting remedies of different sizes and scope.”
    


            But while emergency orders don't decide the merits of a case, they often have significant practical implications in the short term. In 2021, the Supreme Court declined to block a Texas law that banned most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy – even though the law conflicted with the court's landmark 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade. The court's decision effectively allowed Texas to enforce that six-week ban. Months later, the court's conservative majority overturned Roe.
    


            The Supreme Court is expected to hear more than an hour of argument on Thursday and hand down a decision sometime before the end of June.
    


            Between doctor visits and trips to supply their nurseries, Mónica and Meny will be following the outcome anxiously.
    


            “Because we're immigrants doesn't mean that we're enemies of this country,” Meny said. “We come because we have a necessity.”

Fox News contributor and Army veteran Brett Velicovich shares insight into the United States' drone capabilities and how it compares to adversaries like Russia and China.

The U.S. Marine Corps established an attack drone team earlier this year to respond to the rapid development of armed first-person view (FPV) drone technology and tactics, offering a glimpse into the evolving landscape of modern warfare and how future battles could be fought.

The Marine Corps Attack Drone Team (MCADT) will be based at the Weapons Training Battalion, Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia.

The FPV drones used will offer squad-level lethality at a range of up to 20 kilometers, nearly 12.5 miles, for under $5,000, compared to more expensive weapons systems with less capability, according to a press release from the service.

"MCADT is committed to rapidly integrating armed first-person view drones into the FMF [Fleet Marine Force], enhancing small-unit lethality and providing organic capabilities that warfighters currently lack," said Maj. Alejandro Tavizon, the headquarters company commander at Weapons Training Battalion and officer in charge of MCADT.

"By leveraging emerging technologies and refining drone employment tactics, we are ensuring that Marines remain agile, adaptive, and lethal in the modern battlespace."

Brett Velicovich, an Army veteran with extensive drone experience, told Fox News Digital that the creation of MCADT has been long overdue as the United States enters a drone arms race with adversaries like China, Russia and Iran.

"For a while now, we haven't had the needed technology, the needed expertise in low-cost, highly scalable, lethal drone technology that, frankly, is going to be the next part of every piece of the next war that we fight," he said.

Velicovich argued that the United States is far behind other countries, especially China, when it comes to the production of drone technology, and needs to start looking at drones not just as surveillance assets, but as a form of ammunition.

He pointed to Russia's war in Ukraine and the large-scale advancements in domestic drone production that have allowed Ukrainian forces to strike multi-million-dollar enemy tanks and vehicles with drones that cost a few hundred dollars.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced in December that Ukraine manufactured over 1.5 million FPV drones in 2024, including reconnaissance, kamikaze and long-range deep-strike drones. Domestically produced drones accounted for 96.2% of all unmanned aerial vehicles used by Ukrainian forces during the year.

"You have companies and manufacturing plants in Ukraine building 100,000 drones per month. One manufacturing plant is building 100,000 of these things per month. That's real scale. That's where we need to be," Velicovich told Fox News Digital.

The WSJ, citing one Department of Defense estimate, reported that the U.S. has the capacity to build up to 100,000 drones a year.

US, EUROPEAN ALLIES DEMAND ACTION TO END RUSSIA'S USE OF IRANIAN DRONES IN UKRAINE

The number is far below what the United States' adversaries, such as Russia and China, produce in a year, raising national security concerns.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, speaking at a meeting of the Military-Industrial Commission in late April, said that almost all of the country's defense enterprises had met their orders in full last year, highlighting Moscow's efforts to ramp up its war machine.

"Over 1.5 million drones of various types were delivered, with about 4,000 so-called FPV drones equipped with virtual reality control systems supplied to the frontlines daily," Putin said, according to a transcript released by the Kremlin. "I know well, just as many of you here do, that these weapons are still in short supply. We need more of them."

Chinese technology company DJI is also making significant inroads in drone production, in both U.S. and Asian markets. It touts itself as the world's leading manufacturer of consumer and commercial drones.

Craig Singleton, a senior China fellow at the non-partisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital that the Shenzhen-based company dominates the global drone market, controlling more than 70% of the worldwide market share.

"That's alarming, because DJI drones are essentially data collectors for Beijing — giving China potential access to sensitive infrastructure imagery, flight patterns, and more. It's not just a market-share problem — it's a national security threat," he said.

AI-POWERED ATTACK DRONES TAKE FLIGHT

Singleton added that the U.S. doesn't need to match China drone for drone, but it needs a production floor that's sustainable, somewhere around a minimum of 250,000 drones per year.

"We are absolutely in a drone arms race with China — and losing isn't an option. Success will depend on scaling production, protecting sensitive supply chains, and turbocharging innovation," he said. "It's not just about building drones — it's about fielding smarter, cheaper and more resilient swarms faster than Beijing."

How to live longer — and healthier.

by  Bryan Walsh

After more than a century of steady, upward climb, US life expectancy hit 78.9 years in 2015. Since then, it's been mostly downhill. US life expectancy slid to 76.1 years in 2021 at the pandemic's nadir before inching back up to 78.4 years in 2023 — still well below the 2014 peak and lagging most peer nations.

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

So where's the good news? Science is figuring out ways to pump those numbers up again and pointing the way toward living more years — and more healthy years. And this doesn't require sci-fi, Silicon Valley anti-aging technology like blood swapping, or cellular reprogramming. According to Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and the author of the new book Super Agers, there are evidence-based steps you can take right now to help ensure you live a longer, healthier life.

“We're at a turning point,” Topol told me in an interview this week. “Thanks to advances in the science of aging, we can actually show everything is going in the right direction. We're making headway.”

It used to be that if you wanted to know how old you are, all you needed was a calendar. But your body's aging isn't as simple as turning the pages on a calendar: Depending on who you are and how you live, different parts of your body can age more quickly or slowly than. And it turns out this other kind of aging, biological aging, matters more for your health than the number of candles on your birthday cake.

In Super Agers, Topol points to a “metric revolution” in which blood-based proteomic clocks and DNA-methylation scores can pinpoint which organ system is aging the fastest, and by how many years. A 2024 Nature Medicine study used machine learning to examine more than 200 plasma proteins in thousands of people and showed that the resulting biological age forecasted 18 major diseases and all-cause mortality better than any single risk factor, like blood pressure or body mass.

“When you particularize risk to a person, the chance of them taking actions to mitigate it is much, much higher,” Topol said. 

It's one thing to know generally that as you get older, you need to be aware of the risks of heart disease or neurodegenerative diseases. It's another thing to be told that your brain age is, say, five years ahead of your calendar age — which means you need to intervene now to protect yourself.

What you can do: Companies are already offering biological age tests that you can order for your own use. Down the line, scientists at the University of Washington are developing a multi-organ biological clock that will be developed into a digital app.

There's no field where the prevailing advice seems more conflicting and confusing than in the science of nutrition. Atkins, South Beach, Paleo, Zone — you'd be forgiven for throwing up your hands and just ordering takeout from DoorDash.

But we do know what you eat is key to how well and how long you'll live, and the current American diet, heavy on ultra-processed foods and red meat, isn't cutting it. “Our diet is basically inviting disease instead of preventing it., Topol said.

A 30-year study looked at 105,000 adults and found that of the one in 10 study subjects who reached age 70 without cancer, cardiac disease, or serious cognitive decline, virtually all scored high on an eating index that closely tracks Mediterranean-style diets. That means plenty of whole grains, vegetables, olive oil, and omega-rich seafood. You should also try to cut out sugars and ultraprocessed foods as much as possible, and go very easy on red meat, which Topol notes can trigger aging-accelerating inflammation. 

What you can do: Start by something as simple as swapping out butter for olive oil and soda for sparkling water.

At this point, I think everyone knows just how important it is to get a good night's sleep. Poor sleep is associated with everything from heart disease to diabetes to dementia to obesity to cancer, not to mention a significantly increased risk of watching way too many Netflix shows.

But as Topol told me, it's not just how much sleep you're getting, but how you're sleeping. “The key thing is deep sleep,” he said. “If you don't get it, you're much more subject to brain aging and the three major diseases of aging.”

Research has shown that people who get fewer hours of deep sleep per night have a greater risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases like dementia, while a larger amount of deep sleep can act as a protection against Alzheimer's-related memory loss. 

What you can do: During the writing of Super Agers, Topol increased his own deep sleep from around 15 minutes per night to over an hour by adhering to a consistent sleep schedule and tracking his progress with wearables. And steer clear of drugs and supplements, which are unlikely to help you get the deep, restorative slumber you need.

As a cardiologist, Topol was long focused on aerobic exercise, which helps build up the cardiovascular system. But he now realizes that's not enough. “Aerobic was the thing,” he told me. “Now we know that strength and core training are equally important.”

One meta-analysis from 2022 found that just an hour of resistance training per week lowered all-cause mortality by as much as 25 percent. And beyond trying to reduce the chance of death, strength training when you're younger helps build up muscle mass, slowing down the inevitable decline of muscle that occurs as you age. 

What you can do: You don't have to start pumping iron like 1970s Arnold Schwarzenegger to get the anti-aging benefits of strength training. Bodyweight exercises will go a long way, as will resistance training that involves exercise bands. And as much as you may hate them, don't neglect those squats!

It may seem inevitable that as you age, your social circle and connections shrink. But it doesn't have to be that way — and there are enormous longevity benefits to keeping connected to the world and the people around you. “The strong data for social isolation shows it will compromise healthy aging,” Topol said.

A 2023 meta-analysis linked social isolation to a 32 percent higher risk of all-cause mortality, while self-reported loneliness specifically tacked on another 14 percent. Neuro-imaging studies have even shown a biological effect from being alone, demonstrating spikes in inflammatory cytokines and the shrinkage of hippocampal volume in the brain. 

What you can do: Get off your couch and out of your house, for one thing! Schedule regular face time with a friend, and ideally do it outside: Frequent time in nature has been associated with reduced epigenetic aging. 

There's plenty more in Super Agers, including Topol's optimism around GLP-1 inhibitors like Ozempic, which have been showing the ability to reduce the risk of diseases of aging like dementia. But you don't need cutting-edge medicines to live a longer, healthier life. You just need to change how you live your life.

            Despite its reputation as ironclad, it was possible to escape Alcatraz. All it took was brains, guts and 50 raincoats.
    


            On June 11, 1962, three prisoners – Frank Morris and brothers Clarence and John Anglin, all in their 30s – shimmied with a homemade raft through hidden holes in their cell walls, climbed through a ventilation duct onto the roof and bolted from the island fortress into the freezing, choppy waters of the San Francisco Bay.
    


            The notion that the island prison is truly escape-proof is a key part of President Donald Trump's proposal to reopen it more than 60 years after the Bureau of Prisons closed it for being too expensive to operate.
    


            “Nobody's ever escaped from Alcatraz,” Trump asserted Monday in the Oval Office.
    


            But while Morris and the Anglin brothers were never found, fans of outlaw drama – and some of the prisoners' own family members – are convinced they actually made it to shore and lived out their lives hidden from justice and the public eye.
    


            “That case,” said Art Roderick, a retired US marshal involved in the investigation for nearly 40 years, “just never goes away.”
    


            Morris and the Anglins ended up in America's most foreboding prison for the most obvious reason: They were constantly trying to escape every other place they had been held, rap sheets in their FBI files show. Still, the federal complex in California known as The Rock broke neither their spirits nor their record.
    


            “Well, they didn't like being locked up,” said David Widner, 58, who has cowritten a book about his uncles' breakout.
    


            They also didn't like being poor. The FBI documents show more than two dozen charges combined for the two brothers – who grew up in rural Georgia with a dozen other brothers and sisters – mostly for burglary and breaking and entering.
    


            “A lot of it was just so they would have nice things,” Widner said. “They wanted better things that they didn't know how to go about getting other than stealing.”
    


Trump wants to reopen one of America's most notorious prisons. Here's how Alcatraz earned its reputation



            Clarence and John's last theft was of a tiny bank in Columbia, Alabama, the records show. They were arrested five days later – along with their older brother Alfred – on the run in Ohio, netting them 15-year federal prison sentences.
    


            The Anglins were transferred to Alcatraz following an escape attempt at the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas, which at the time was the largest maximum-security prison in the United States. Prison officials said Clarence tried to get out – with John's help – by hiding inside two large metal breadboxes.
    


            Clarence only got as far as the prison bakery before being caught, FBI records show, but it was the kind of creative solution that didn't surprise the Anglin family. As children, the boys once figured out how to reuse a punctured tire by packing the hole full of moss, Widner told CNN.
    


            When the Anglins were paired in adjoining cells at Alcatraz next to Morris – another prisoner sent to the Rock due to repeated escapes – another attempt seemed almost inevitable.
    


            Based on the evidence they could gather, along with testimony from inmate Allen West – who was part of the conspiracy but said the three escapees left without him that night in 1962 – the Federal Bureau of Investigation pieced together an extraordinary plot accomplished slowly over six months:
    


            The most ingenious part of the men's plan may have been using cement fragments, cotton, hair fragments from the prison barber shop, glue and paint to create three dummy heads. The improvised sculptures were crude and grotesque but just realistic enough at a distance to fool the night guards into thinking the men were sound asleep in their beds.
    


            “My mom and the brothers and sisters always said they were the modern-day MacGyvers,” Widner remembered, recalling the TV show about a technical genius who uses found objects to construct whatever he needs to get out of tricky situations. “They could take nothing and make something out of it.”
    


            Investigators agreed, according to an FBI case memo filed three days after the escape. The “work which the subjects performed in preparation for the escape is fantastic,” Special Agent in Charge Frank L. Price said.
    


            Another factor working in the men's favor was the prison's deterioration. Plans were already underway to decommission the extraordinarily costly prison, according to Roderick, with Warden Olin Blackwell telling reporters it would take $5 million to get Alcatraz in proper condition, the equivalent today of $53 million.
    


            “They weren't doing any repairs at the time,” the retired marshal said, and the Bureau of Prisons was struggling to keep the facility properly staffed. “You put all that together, and that's how the escape occurred.”
    


            Investigators found the men punched out holes in their cell walls by drilling them over weeks and covering their work with painted cardboard, FBI records show. Climbing up the pipes of a utility shaft, the inmates disassembled the ventilation covers, descended the roof on a chimney pipe and scaled a fence.
    


            Launching the raft they had designed with the help of a Sports Illustrated magazine, the three escaped into the frigid darkness, government files say.
    


            Intriguing clues soon turned up. But, somehow, they all seemed to go nowhere.
    


            “I have never in my life come across a case that has more of those types of leads,” Roderick said.
    


            Within hours of the escape, investigators scoured the waters around Alcatraz. State police were put on alert. The Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers contributed boats and a helicopter, FBI records show. Blackwell, the warden, even ordered a full search of Alcatraz on the off chance the men never actually left.
    


            A hundred soldiers and 35 military police combed Angel Island, the spot just north of Alcatraz where West told investigators the men planned to go. “No evidence was found to indicate the Escapees ever reached this island,” an FBI report says.
    


            “Of course, it became the hottest thing in the media at the time,” retired FBI agent John Arend said years later. “We didn't have cable news, but you had all the media very fascinated with this case.”
    


            Then, the first bit of evidence the guys might have survived appeared. But it did not wash up on shore. It arrived by mail.
    


                    “HA HA WE MADE IT.”
                





            The postcard addressed to “Warden, Alcatraz Prison” turned up June 18, signed “Frank, Jim, Clarence,” each in a different hand.
    


            The FBI commissioned a handwriting expert, who determined the signature of “Clarence” was likely a forgery. There were not enough handwriting samples of John and Frank to make a comparison, and the FBI concluded the card was probably a hoax inspired by the intense and worldwide news coverage.
    


            Within days, searchers skimming the waters near Alcatraz Island, with its crystal-clear view of the Golden Gate Bridge, found sparse evidence related to the escape, including a portion of one of their improvised oars and part of a homemade life jacket, FBI records show.
    


            Sealed packets made out of the same material as the raft contained personal photos of the Anglins and family addresses, as well as contact information for a San Francisco attorney who had defended Alcatraz inmates in the past, the files say. The attorney told the FBI he never heard from Morris or the Anglins.
    


            The government files contain dozens of contacts from people who said they may have seen the prisoners, but none ever panned out. They also include then-Director J. Edgar Hoover's reluctance to reveal the information the bureau had to the public.
    


            “I trust our (San Francisco) Office isn't giving (a) ‘blow by blow' account to the press nor anyone else,” Hoover said in a June 13 memo. “Our job is to find these thugs, not keep them advised of our progress.”
    


            The Anglin family is convinced that, despite the FBI's release of hundreds of pages of documents in the case, the agency is still reluctant to discuss the full story.
    


            “They know things they won't tell because they couldn't find them,” Widmer said.
    


            Widner's first encounter with his uncles' story came in 1977, when four men from the FBI visited his home and asked his mother Marie if she had any information about where her brothers, Clarence and John Anglin, ended up, he said.
    


            “She told them no, and if she did (know), she wouldn't tell them,” he said.
    


            Two years later, the FBI closed its investigation, saying it had never found any evidence Morris and the Anglin brothers survived the escape attempt. “They are presumed to be dead,” a 1979 memo stated.
    


            But the Marshals Service, which is responsible for capturing fugitives, has never closed its file. Wanted posters of the three remain on the service's website, and the government even created computer-aged portraits showing how they believe the men would have appeared in their mid-80s.
    


            “There have been actionable leads that have come in,” said Roderick, the retired marshal who continues to consult on the case.
    


            The assumption that Morris and the Anglin brothers could not have possibly survived the tricky tides and freezing cold spray of the San Francisco Bay took a hit in 2003 from an unlikely source: reality TV. The Discovery Channel science program “MythBusters” launched its own raincoat raft from Alcatraz, matching the tools and circumstances of the 1962 escape as closely as possible. (Discovery and CNN share the same parent company.)
    


            Following the bay's currents west toward the Golden Gate Bridge instead of the long-assumed path north toward Angel Island, hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman successfully landed at the Marin Headlands in their homemade watercraft, saying the three men's survival was “entirely possible.”
    


            A decade later, Dutch scientists using computer models of currents in the Bay found the brothers and Morris could have made it safely to the Golden Gate Bridge area if they had left between 11 p.m. and midnight. Prison officials believed the men escaped between 10:30 and 11 p.m., they told the FBI.
    


            The changing tides would then have sent any debris related to their trek back toward Angel Island, the researchers found. “We don't know how good they were at paddling, but I suppose if you ever have energy to spare, it would be in that situation,” said study co-author Rolf Hut at the Delft University of Technology.
    


            More than 40 years after the FBI turned over the investigation to the Marshals Service, leads continue to surface. The Anglin family says it got a photo from a family friend purportedly showing the brothers in Brazil in 1975, something the Marshals Service has said is impossible to verify.
    


            In 2013, the FBI got a letter that claimed to be from John Anglin, CNN affiliate KPIX reported. The writer said he would be willing to turn himself in if he was publicly promised cancer treatment and a one-year prison sentence.
    


            Even relatives who believe the inmates survived their escape acknowledge the men – who would now all be in their 90s – are almost certainly no longer around to be found.
    


            “They either died in the Bay or are dead by now,” Roderick said.
    


            The dramatic 1962 disappearance – which inspired the 1979 Clint Eastwood movie, “Escape from Alcatraz” – seemed to harden the resolve of then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy that Alcatraz had outlived its usefulness, telling reporters he was committing to closing it.
    


            “Kennedy does not agree with the view that Alcatraz should be retained as a deterent (sic) to hardened criminals in that other institutions could fill the same role at less expense,” stated an FBI memo, citing a story in the San Francisco Chronicle.
    


            Alcatraz was shuttered for good the following year, remaining dormant until the National Park Service began converting it into a museum in 1972. Since then, the former lockup has attracted more than a million visitors a year, one of the most popular National Park sites, according to the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy.
    


            But Trump sees the site much differently.
    


            “It represents something strong, very powerful in terms of law and order. Our country needs law and order; Alcatraz is, I would say, the ultimate,” the president said Monday. “We'll see if we can bring it back in large form, add a lot.”
    


            Widner, the Anglins' nephew, has visited Alcatraz many times. He says he stays out of political debates but doesn't like the idea of scrapping the museum to make Alcatraz great again.
    


            “I think it's a bad idea,” Widner said. “You would be losing a lot of history there.”

ATLANTA (AP) — A 4.1-magnitude earthquake in Tennessee woke up families and rattled homes as far away as Atlanta as it spread tremors across portions of the southern U.S. on Saturday morning. No injuries or major damage were immediately reported.

The website for USGS said the earthquake originated shortly after 9 a.m. EDT about 12 miles from Greenback, Tennessee, which is about 30 miles south of Knoxville.

More than 23,000 reports from the public were received by USGS in the first hour after the earthquake, USGS spokeswoman Ayesha Davis told the Associated Press in an email. Meteorologists at television news stations serving Georgia and North Carolina reported feeling the tremors as well.

There is a 5% chance of a magnitude 4 or larger aftershock in the next week, according to USGS.

Gabriela Reilly was making waffles with her husband when they felt their entire home shake in Braselton, Georgia, which is northeast of Atlanta.

“Our ceiling fan started shaking for about 10 seconds,” she said. “I thought a giant aircraft had flown low right over the neighborhood, but my husband said, ‘No, that was definitely an earthquake!'”

Jason Pack was still in bed at his home outside Knoxville when he felt the walls shaking and heard a rumbling that was loud enough to wake up his family and for the dog to start barking.

“In east Tennessee, you're used to tornadoes and floods, that kind of thing,” Pack said. “It's unusual to have an earthquake.”

Pack has experienced tremors before, although this one is probably the strongest he's felt in Tennessee.

“Even though this one was small, it's a good reminder — if it had been a big quake, would you know what to do? Drop, cover, and hold on if you're inside,” said Pack, a retired FBI agent who now works in crisis communications. “Stay clear of buildings if you're outside.”

Damage does not usually occur from earthquakes until they reach a magnitude of somewhere above 4 or 5, according to USGS, although it depends on variables such as building construction, soil, and distance from the epicenter.

The southeastern U.S. carries a significant earthquake risk, particularly around the New Madrid Seismic Zone to the west and in the East Tennessee Seismic Zone, which is where Saturday's earthquake occurred, said Davis.

Since 1950, 15 other earthquakes of magnitude 4 or larger have occurred within 155 miles of Saturday's earthquake, Davis said. The largest of those was a magnitude 4.7 earthquake near Knoxville in November 1973.

More recently, two tremors struck the seismic zone in December 2018. One was a 4.4 magnitude earthquake that was centered in Decatur, Tennessee, which is south of Knoxville. It shook homes as far away as Atlanta.

Another earthquake struck a few days later with a magnitude of 3.0. Its epicenter was about two miles southeast of Mascot, near Knoxville. It also was felt in parts of Georgia, Kentucky, and North Carolina.

Seismic waves from earthquakes spread more efficiently in the Eastern U.S. compared to the West because of the region's geology, Davis said.

“Earthquakes in the East are felt over a much larger distance and by more people,” she said.

Disney's announcement last week that its newest theme park will be in Abu Dhabi offers further confirmation of the status of the United Arab Emirates as a global consumer crossroads located in the Middle East. At the center of the UAE's economic engine is man-made Yas Island, located 20 minutes from the center of Abu Dhabi and which first began development in 2006 for the Formula 1 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Since that 2009 debut for F1 in the region, Ferrari World, Yas Waterworld, Warner Bros. World, and SeaWorld Yas Island have followed. By 2024, Yas Island's traffic hit 38 million visitors.   

"The UAE in many respects is the crossroads of the world," Iger said of Disney's decision. "About 500 million people that are income qualified, meaning they can afford to visit one of our parks, live within a four-hour plane trip here." 

The UAE is the second-largest economy in the Arab world, after Saudi Arabia, and the more diversified market-based economy. Since the mid-2000s, Abu Dhabi has been actively pursuing new economic opportunities, with major efforts accelerating in the 2006–2008 period under its strategic Economic Vision 2030 plan, when Yas Island development began. A 6-8 hour flight from 80% of the world's population — and boasting the largest global airline hub in the world, clocking 120 million passengers each year — the strategic geography, massive investment, and major consumer attractions situate Yas Island to continue to expand its status as a global consumer epicenter. 

"Abu Dhabi continues to be a destination of choice for the world," said Mohamed Khalifa Al Mubarak, chairman of the Department of Culture and Tourism Abu Dhabi, and Chairman of Miral — the developer of Yas Island, which will fully develop and build the park working with Disney Imagineers.

Historically, Dubai has led the way in diversifying away from reliance on oil, but Dubai has always been more dependent on non-oil revenue to drive its economy. Its crude reserves pale in comparison to Abu Dhabi, with just 1% of its GDP coming from oil. By comparison, Abu Dhabi holds 90% of the UAE oil reserves, and draws 60% of its GDP from petroleum. Included in the UAE economic plan is a target of reducing oil revenue to less than 40% of its GDP.  

The consumer economy is a key part of the plan, but the UAE's future is far from centered only on creating more tourist attractions. Karen Young, senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, said the center of Abu Dhabi's economic significance remains finance. 

"Abu Dhabi is a finance capital, led by its multiple sovereign investment vehicles," she said. The Disney park is another display of that economic power. "Its power comes from its ability to deploy capital, not attract tourism," Young said. 

Disney will not be investing capital in the project, although it does have current plans to invest $60 billion in other theme parks around the world.

The UAE's investment strength isn't just on display at home, but expanding to many U.S. projects as well, including recent deals to power AI infrastructure within the country.

"The theme park is a nice addition to other attractions in Yas island, and is an effort to bring quality of life amenities to residents and tourists," Young said. But she added, "Dubai's economy is much more dependent on tourism."

As a result of its greater need, Dubai's success with consumer attractions has been more uneven than Abu Dhabi's, according to experts, which deliberately chose a slower growth model given its significant oil reserves — it gave a financial lifeline to Dubai following the 2008 financial crisis. But the move toward a more diversified economy is showing signs of major acceleration with the Disney deal. 

Overall, the UAE "is absolutely in a growth mode," said Dennis Speigel, Founder & CEO of International Theme Park Services, an industry consultant. Abu Dhabi and Yas Island have built on demand at a proper pace, he says, developing a critical mass of leisure entertainment. While Dubai, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar have all been trying to attract Disney going back as far as a decade, Speigel said Yas Island is the right location for a Disney theme park in what he referred to as the final frontier for leisure development.

Disney isn't saying when the park will open, with executives only pointing to general theme park construction timelines, which can take up to five years from design to development and buildout. As construction of the Disney park proceeds, it may face questions about worker conditions, which have long been an issue of controversy in the region's development boom. But for now, Speigel says, "bringing the Disney organization's commitment to Abu Dhabi and Yas Island demonstrates that this area within the UAE has reached the pinnacle of entertainment."

As struggling drugstore chains work to regain their footing, Walgreens is doubling down on automation. 

The company is expanding the number of retail stores served by its micro-fulfillment centers, which use robots to fill thousands of prescriptions for patients who take medications to manage or treat diabetes, high blood pressure and other conditions. 

Walgreens aims to free up time for pharmacy staff, reducing their routine tasks and eliminating inventory waste. Fewer prescription fills would allow employees to interact directly with patients and perform more clinical services such as vaccinations and testing.

Walgreens first rolled out the robot-powered centers in 2021, but paused expansion in 2023 to focus on gathering feedback and improving performance at existing sites. After more than a year of making upgrades, including new internal tools, the company said it is ready to expand the reach of that technology again.

Walgreens told CNBC it hopes to have its 11 micro-fulfillment centers serve more than 5,000 stores by the end of the year, up from 4,800 in February and 4,300 in October 2023. As of February, the centers handled 40% of the prescription volume on average at supported pharmacies, according to Walgreens. 

That translates to around 16 million prescriptions filled each month across the different sites, the company said. 

The renewed automation push comes as Walgreens prepares to go private in a roughly $10 billion deal with Sycamore Partners, expected to close by the end of the year. 

The deal would cap a turbulent chapter for Walgreens as a public company, marked by a rocky transition out of the pandemic, declining pharmacy reimbursement rates, weaker consumer spending and fierce competition from CVS Health, Amazon and other retail giants.

Like CVS, Walgreens has shifted from opening new stores to closing hundreds of underperforming locations to shore up profits. Both companies are racing to stay relevant as online retailers lure away customers and patients increasingly opt for fast home delivery over traditional pharmacy visits.

The changes also follow mounting discontent among pharmacy staff: In 2023, nationwide walkouts spotlighted burnout and chronic understaffing, forcing chains to reexamine their operational models.

Walgreens said the investment in robotic pharmacy fills is already paying off.

To date, micro-fulfillment centers have generated approximately $500 million in savings by cutting excess inventory and boosting efficiency, said Kayla Heffington, Walgreens' pharmacy operating model vice president. Heffington added that stores using the facilities are administering 40% more vaccines than those that aren't. 

"Right now, they're the backbone to really help us offset some of the workload in our stores, to obviously allow more time for our pharmacists and technicians to spend time with patients," said Rick Gates, Walgreens' chief pharmacy officer.

"It gives us a lot more flexibility to bring down costs, to increase the care and increase speed to therapy – all those things," he said. 

Gates added that the centers give Walgreens a competitive advantage because independent pharmacies and some rivals don't have centralized support for their stores. Still, Walmart, Albertsons and Kroger have similarly tested or are currently using their own micro-fulfillment facilities to dispense grocery items and other prescriptions. 

Micro-fulfillment centers come with their own risks, such as a heavy reliance on sophisticated robotics that can cause disruptions if errors occur. But the facilities are becoming a permanent fixture in retail due to the cost savings they offer and their ability to streamline workflows, reduce the burden on employees and deliver goods to customers faster.

When a Walgreens retail pharmacy receives a prescription, the system determines whether it should be filled at that location or routed to a nearby micro-fulfillment center. Maintenance medications, or prescription drugs taken regularly to manage chronic health conditions, and refills that don't require immediate pickup are often sent to micro-fulfillment.

At the core of each facility is a highly automated system that uses robotics, conveyor belts and barcode scanners, among other tools, to fill prescriptions. The operations are supported by a team of pharmacists pharmacy technicians and other professionals.

Instead of staff members filling prescriptions by hand at stores, pill bottles move through an automated and carefully choreographed assembly line. 

Pharmacy technicians fill canisters with medications for robot pods to dispense, and pharmacists verify those canisters to make sure they are accurate. Yellow robotic arms grab a labeled prescription vial and hold it up to a canister, which precisely dispenses the specific medication for that bottle.

Certain prescriptions are filled at separate manual stations, including inhalers and birth control pill packs. Each prescription is then sorted and packaged for delivery back to retail pharmacy locations for final pickup.

There are other security and safety measures throughout the process, said Ahlam Antar, registered group supervisor of a micro-fulfillment center in Mansfield, Massachusetts. 

For example, the robot pods automatically lock and signal an error with a red-orange light if a worker attaches a canister to the wrong dispenser, preventing the incorrect pills from going in a prescription, she said. 

Properly training workers at the centers to ensure accuracy and patient safety is also crucial, according to Sarah Gonsalves, a senior certified pharmacy technician at the Mansfield site. 

She said a core part of her role is to make sure that technicians can correctly perform the different tasks in the process. 

Antar, who has worked at the Mansfield site since its 2022 opening, said Walgreens has made improvements to the micro-fulfillment process after considering feedback from stores and patients during the paused expansion. That includes establishing new roles needed to support the process at the sites, such as a training manager for all 11 locations. 

The facilities also plan to transition to using smaller prescription vials after hearing concerns that the current bottles are too large, according to a Walgreens spokesperson. They said that will allow the centers to ship more prescriptions per order and reduce costs.

Heffington said the automated locations have helped reduce Walgreens' overall prescription fulfillment costs by nearly 13% compared to a year ago. 

She said Walgreens has also increased prescription volume by 126% year-over-year, now filling more than 170 million prescriptions annually. The company hopes to raise that number to 180 million or even more. 

Heffington added that Walgreens implemented new internal tools to track the work across all 11 centers and provide real-time data on where a patient's prescription is in the micro-fulfillment process. 

"If a patient called the store and said, 'Hey, can you tell me where my prescription is today?' [Workers] can do that with great specificity," thanks to the new tools, Heffington said. 

Despite the company's progress, Gates said there is more work to be done with micro-fulfillment centers. 

For example, he pointed to the possibility of shipping prescriptions directly to patients' doorsteps instead of putting that burden on retail stores. 

"It's only step one right now," he said. 

Other improvements may still be needed at facilities, according to some reports. For example, WRAL News reported in April that some customers at a Walgreens store in Garner, North Carolina, say they are only getting partial prescription fills, with several pills missing, or their medicine is being delayed.

Before Brian Gange's Arizona store started relying on an automated facility, he walked into the pharmacy every morning knowing that a massive list of prescriptions was in his work queue waiting to be filled for the day. 

Now, with help from micro-fulfillment, that list is significantly smaller each day, according to Gange. 

"We don't have to spend as much time on just those repetitive fulfillment tasks," he told CNBC. "It really takes a huge weight off our shoulders." 

Gange said that gives him and his team time to step behind the pharmacy counter and interact with customers face-to-face, answering questions, providing advice, performing health tests or administering vaccines. 

That kind of attention can make all the difference for a patient.  

For example, Gange recalls stepping away for five minutes to take a patient's blood pressure despite being overwhelmed with tasks while working at a different Walgreens location several years ago. He ended up sending that person to the emergency room because their blood pressure was "off the charts." 

That patient's wife visited the pharmacy the next day to thank Gange, saying her husband "probably wouldn't be here with us today" without that blood pressure test. 

"I shouldn't have to question whether I have that five or 10 minutes to check a blood pressure for a patient," Gange said. "Micro-fulfillment and centralized services are really what are going to allow us to be able to do that, to have that time." 

"That really allows us to provide better care for them," he added.

Media companies are staring down widespread economic uncertainty as their annual pitch to advertisers and marketers kicks off.

This week legacy entertainment giants including Comcast's NBCUniversal, Fox Corp. and Warner Bros. Discovery will stage presentations to ad buyers about why they should commit money to their upcoming slates of sports, entertainment and news programming. Netflix and Amazon's Prime Video are crowding the field holding their second annual Upfronts. Paramount Global held its presentations with advertisers and agencies last week.

This year the stakes are high as chief marketing officers across brands formulate contingency plans for a variety of outcomes regarding tariffs, inflation, consumer sentiment and other macroeconomic shifts that could affect their spending.

The evolving cost landscape adds to the existing headwinds facing the media industry: Pay-TV subscribers are fleeing for streaming options. And while streaming has begun to reach profitability for some companies, the services have yet to prove as lucrative as the traditional bundle. Meanwhile competition is stiff as digital and social media players capture the lion's share of ad dollars.

It'll prove another year of Upfronts clouded by concerns following the Covid pandemic and Hollywood strikes. Last year showed stabilization in an ad market, and executives had earlier told CNBC 2025 was expected to be another year of normalization.

Instead, the industry is bracing itself — and executives are fine-tuning their pitch for the moment.

"Media becomes more complicated in the landscape that's defined by inflation, regulatory uncertainty, shifting go-to-market timelines, and that serves as this backdrop for the season," said John Halley, ad sales chief at Paramount. "In moments of uncertainty like this there are very few places that offer the reach, the brand safety and the impact of the Paramount portfolio. That's an important point to make in a market like this."

In interviews with the top ad chiefs among the legacy media companies, executives touted sure-fire content and reliable viewership metrics in an effort to demonstrate the importance of advertising during uncertain times. Many executives said they have yet to see a "material" pullback on ad spending, as had been feared.

Chief among the top categories during Upfronts is live sports, they said. Live events, like awards shows, and so-called "must-see TV" will also be a big factor in conversations.

"Sports is having a halo on live [TV] in general," said Gina Reduto, executive vice president of ad strategy at NBCUniversal.

Although general entertainment has fallen behind sports in ratings, shows like Warner Bros. Discovery's "The White Lotus," which generated steady viewership and controlled the cultural conversation on a weekly basis, stand out.

"I think everyone knows that regardless of what happens, they still have to sell, they still have to move [product]," said Rita Ferro, Disney's president of global advertising. "They say, 'We still have to deliver products and services to our customers, and we have to do that in the best ways possible.' That's understanding the parameters we're dealing with and what those implications are in terms of pricing."

Concerns that President Donald Trump's trade war could jack up prices have yet to translate into a pullback in advertising spending, media executives told CNBC. Quarterly reports for media companies have yet to reflect any decrease in spend due to tariffs, although the decline of the linear TV bundle has weighed down financials.

WBD has yet to see "any material cuts" to its advertising volume, said Ryan Gould and Bobby Voltaggio, the company's presidents of U.S. advertising sales.

"The sentiment in the market isn't really indicative of what we're seeing currently. But you know, obviously, the future state of impact is yet to be known," said Voltaggio.

Jeff Collins, Fox's president of ad sales, echoed his peers: "Every client that we're talking with obviously has their scenario planning down for different things that could happen. But I think one of the important lessons that they learned during Covid was not to overreact to uncertainty.

"Obviously you need to have a plan, and they all have plans," Collins said. "But until there's some sort of tangible impact to their business, we haven't seen anyone really looking to pullback."

Disney's Ferro said her team has spent additional time with advertising partners in recent months, discussing various scenarios in which tariffs could affect different categories and products. She added chief marketing officers she's spoken with are operating in what she called "war rooms."

Ferro recounted specific conversations with a mobile phone company (which she declined to identify) that highlight the trade policy volatility: The phone company on a Friday in mid-April decided to pull an order for roughly $1.5 million in advertising for the month in light of tariff exposure. That weekend, the Trump administration exempted smartphones and other devices from the tariff scheme.

"So on Monday, that deal that went away on Friday went to order," said Ferro.

"It's literally in real time what's happening. I think there's a lot of scenarios they're going through and it's very in real time," Ferro said.

Data firm eMarketer estimated traditional TV advertising spending during Upfronts will decline by between $2.78 billion and $4.12 billion, depending on the severity of the tariff impact. Spending on streaming in these annual discussions will be more stable, however, with eMarketer expecting $1 billion in growth in that category. Media companies sell advertising for both platforms together.

This gives advertisers the upper hand when negotiating pricing, with the exception of sports content. It's likely the companies that are more affected by the loss of pay-TV subscribers will be willing to lower their pricing, said Jonathan Gudai, CEO of Adomni, a digital advertising platform.

Ad data firm EDO said there has already been a pullback on estimated ad spending in the automotive and various retail and consumer sectors since Trump's announcement on tariffs.

At the same time, concerns from consumers on soon-to-be higher prices has translated to higher ad effectiveness. For example, home appliances brands cut estimated spending by 30%, but consumers' responsiveness to ads rose 77%.

Media executives — who largely declined to discuss pricing — all said data from firms like EDO is key in discussions with advertisers, which are increasingly looked for tailored, targeted buys rather than sheer audience size.

"Advertisers are saying, 'I want to buy very specific audiences.' That's why outcomes are so important," said Kevin Krim, CEO of EDO. "You've got to have a very granular view of what you're willing to pay for."

All of these factors play into a recurring question for the advertising market: Do the annual Upfronts still matter?

"I've been in the business for about 30 years and the question of do we still need the Upfront [presentations] comes up every single year," said Fox's Collins.

The answer this year for the traditional media giants may be: more than ever.

"That's the last moment that you want to quit advertising because, you know, you got to try harder, not sort of capitulate," said EDO's Krim.

Krim added the need for flexibility makes real-time data more important: "You cannot be using last year's model."

He also said it may further shift ad dollars to programmatic buying, putting media companies on a more "level playing field" with digital companies like Meta, Amazon and Google. Despite being behemoths in the ad space, these tech companies have started to reveal the beginnings of cracks in their ad businesses.

The annual presentations could also lock in buying for some of the consistent favorite categories.

NBCUniversal's Reduto told CNBC that locking in ads during the Upfronts gives "an opportunity for advertisers to guarantee they have access to the things they know truly drives sales."

Earlier this year, Mark Marshall, NBCUniversal's chairman of global advertising and partnerships said in a letter that mapped out the company's upcoming slate of big sports events, including the Super Bowl, Olympics and World Cup, as proof of Upfronts' utility.

"I think from an advertiser perspective they still value the ability to lock in the franchise positions that they want to own, lock them in at desirable pricing, and be afforded flexibility," said Collins.

In this article

The U.S. Federal Reserve recently announced its plan to keep interest rates steady, cautioning, "uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further." It noted that the risk of higher unemployment and elevated inflation have risen. Indeed, tariff wars have shaken global markets and knocked investor sentiment.

Nonetheless, investors looking for attractive picks amid the ongoing volatility can track the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts, who have the expertise to select stocks with the potential to thrive despite short-term challenges.

With that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

We start this week with Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms (META), which surpassed analysts' estimates for the first quarter of 2025, reflecting resilience in a tough macroeconomic backdrop. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Meta is well-positioned to navigate any ongoing challenges.

In reaction to the strong Q1 print, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth reiterated a buy rating on META stock and boosted the 12-month price target to $675 from $610, saying that Meta remains his firm's top pick. Noting the company's Q1 beat and Q2 outlook, Anmuth said he believed the company's artificial intelligence (AI) ad enhancements, such as Andromeda and GEM, are having a significant impact on its ability to make money from the technology. 

On the rise in Meta Platforms' full-year capital expenditure guidance, the analyst said that he is OK with the increase, given that the company is delivering good results and tracking well on its AI roadmap. He added that Meta has a track record of generating returns on increased spending.  

Anmuth said that AI is fueling huge early gains in Meta's advertising and engagement, with the analyst expecting notable progress soon in business messaging/agents and Meta AI.

"We continue to believe that Meta is well positioned for a tougher macro environment given its scaled advertiser base, highly performant platform and vertical agnostic inventory," Anmuth said.

Anmuth ranks No. 49 among more than 9,500 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 20.1%. See Meta Platforms Options Activity on TipRanks.

Anmuth is also bullish on e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (AMZN). Following the company's Q1 results, the analyst reaffirmed a buy rating on AMZN and raised the price target to $225 from $220. Amazon reported better-than-expected Q1 2025 results but issued soft guidance for the second quarter, citing tariff woes.

The analyst noted that the company's Q1 revenue and operating income exceeded the higher end of prior guidance, while the second-quarter outlook reflected lower-than-feared macro and tariff-related impacts.

Though Microsoft's Azure outperformed Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the March quarter and AWS is currently capacity-constrained, the analyst continues to believe that growth can move higher in the second half of the year as more supply comes online. He added that Amazon is not witnessing any visible change in demand.

Anmuth noted that the sequential deceleration in AWS revenue growth to 17% in Q1 2025 from 19% in the fourth quarter was offset by solid profitability. Notably, AWS' operating margin touched an all-time high of 39.5% in the first quarter.  

The analyst said that while Amazon did not discuss all its mitigation efforts related to suppliers and geographic sourcing of products, it has taken measures to pull forward inventory because of the tariff wars.

"Importantly, AMZN remains focused on broad selection, low pricing and fast delivery, and believes it typically emerges from uncertain macro periods with greater relative market share gains," said Anmuth. See Amazon Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.

Finally, let's look at Roku (ROKU), a maker of streaming devices and other products, and a distributor of streaming services. While Roku delivered a modest revenue beat and reported a narrower-than-anticipated loss per share for the first quarter, shares declined as the company trimmed its full-year revenue outlook and issued lower-than-expected Q2 revenue guidance.

Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese highlighted that while Roku lowered its 2025 revenue outlook, it maintained Platform revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance, crediting enhanced profit from its initiatives and anticipated revenue from acquiring Frndly TV. Roku last week agreed to buy Frndly TV, an affordable subscription streaming service that offers live TV, on-demand video, and cloud-based DVR (Digital Video Recorder), for $185 million in cash in a deal espected to close in the second quarter.

Despite the impact of macroeconomic challenges, Reese believes that Roku is well-positioned within the relatively safe connected TV industry owing to increasing diversification of platform revenue. The analyst also highlighted that a more diversified business model is helping Roku deliver consistent results.

Reese thinks that investors will appreciate Roku for its balanced approach as it grows internationally, improves its platform and enhances The Roku Channel's ad capabilities, while focusing on expense discipline to drive free cash flow.

"We expect Roku to benefit from its DSP (demand-side platform) partnerships, high-quality inventory, improved targeting sports-adjacent ads, and various price points across its platform to meet advertisers' needs," said Reese, reiterating a buy rating on ROKU stock with a price target of $100.  

Reese ranks No. 830 among more than 9,500 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Her ratings have been profitable 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.5%. See Roku Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

The Social Security Administration is under new leadership, after financial services executive Frank Bisignano was sworn in as commissioner this week.

Bisignano's confirmation follows a host of changes at the federal agency during the first 100 days of the Trump administration, many of them through the Department of Government Efficiency.

For the approximate 73 million beneficiaries who rely on monthly Social Security checks, those changes may affect how they receive services from the agency.

From benefit increases for certain pensioners to changing policies on benefit withholdings and customer service, here are some of the biggest shifts of which beneficiaries should take note.

A new law that went into effect in January will provide almost 3 million individuals with increased Social Security benefits.

The Social Security Fairness Act provides higher monthly Social Security checks for individuals who also receive pensions from work that did not include payment of Social Security payroll taxes. It will also provide lump sum retroactive payments starting from January 2024.

Monthly benefit increases may range from "very little" to "over $1,000 more each month," according to the Social Security Administration, which began those adjustments in February.

The change affects certain workers such as teachers, firefighters and police officers; federal employees under the Civil Service Retirement System; and people who work under foreign social security programs, according to the agency. Those workers had previously seen their benefits reduced or eliminated due to the Windfall Elimination Provision and Government Pension Offset, which have been nixed with the new law.

In the first 100 days of the Trump administration, SSA has paid more than $14.8 billion in retroactive payments to more than 2.2 million individuals, according to the agency.

The agency has expedited the processing of the benefit changes under President Donald Trump. However, it may take a year or more to issue payments for some cases that cannot be processed through automation, according to the agency.

Social Security beneficiaries are sometimes overpaid benefits due to errors.

When that happens, the Social Security Administration requires the extra money to be repaid to the agency.

Because it can take months or years to catch on to those mistakes, beneficiaries can be on the hook to repay big sums. That money may be withheld from benefit checks until the overpayment has been repaid.

The Social Security Administration has made various adjustments to the default withholding rate from benefits.

In response to complaints that a 100% default withholding rate caused financial hardship for affected beneficiaries, the agency under President Joe Biden changed that default withholding rate to 10% of a beneficiary's monthly benefit or $10, whichever was greater.

Under Trump, SSA has had a tougher stance on overpayments. In March, the agency announced it planned to reinstate the default withholding rate to 100% of an individual's monthly benefit. The change was estimated to generate about $7 billion in overpayment recoveries in the next decade.

However, the agency recently issued an emergency message notifying its employees that new overpayment notices sent on or after April 25 will have a 50% default withholding rate. That applies to retirement, survivors and disability insurance benefits. The withholding rate for Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, benefits is still 10%.

Some experts worry a 50% default withholding rate is still too high.

"Losing 50% [of benefits] for a lot of people could put them into immediate economic hardship," Richard Fiesta, executive director of the Alliance for Retired Americans, recently told CNBC.com.

Overpayment of Social Security is not the only reason benefits may be withheld.

On May 5, the government resumed collections efforts on federal student loans in default. Now, the Education Department may use the Treasury Department Offset Program to withhold benefits for defaulted loans, as well as other payments like tax refunds and salaries. Some of those garnishments could start as soon as June, according to the Education Department.

The Social Security Administration may also withhold current and future Social Security checks for child support, alimony or restitution payments, according to the agency.

The IRS may take a portion of Social Security payments until it recoups the full balance of overdue federal tax debts.

Individuals who call SSA's 800 phone number face long hold times before they speak to someone at the agency.

To make an in-person appointment, they must either call that number or visit the website, which has experienced glitches.

Those difficulties are "neither new nor unique to the current administration," Republican House Ways and Means Committee members recently wrote to Bisignano. Meanwhile, Democrats worry those difficulties could signal bigger problems ahead.

In a bid to reduce wait times, the agency has encouraged individuals to use its web site when possible.

The agency is in the process of modernizing its telecommunications platform, which is expected to allow it to better manage calls and provide more self-service options. The rollout, which is expected to be completed by the end of this summer, has helped improve answer rates and average speed of answer, based on early results, according to the Social Security Administration.

As Bisignano takes the helm, advocacy groups are urging for the agency to make the needs of its beneficiaries a priority.

"The vast majority of his current customer base cannot transact financial business through anything other than face to face contact in an office or on the telephone, and they have to be prepared to accommodate that," said Maria Freese, senior legislative representative at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.

The Trump administration tasked the Department of Government Efficiency with curbing "waste, fraud and abuse" at federal agencies.

Under DOGE, the Social Security Administration sought to make it so services that could previously be handled over the phone would need to be done in person at an agency office to prevent fraud.

However, the agency has since scaled back that policy to allow for claims for retirement, survivor and spousal and children's benefits to still be permitted over the phone. Individuals making other claims, including Social Security disability insurance, Medicare and Supplemental Security Income, can also still use the agency's 800 number.

Notably, changes to direct deposit information will mostly still need to be handled either online or in person.

Consequently, almost 2 million more elderly and disabled individuals may need to visit Social Security offices in person annually, the Social Security Administration has revealed.

The online process may be difficult for some individuals because it requires multi-factor, multi-step online verification and a one-time PIN code, CBPP notes. Previous estimates have found that about 42% of older adults may lack access to reliable broadband service, according to the AARP.

In some cases, people may be able to change their direct deposit information over the phone if they are also able to verify their identity online, according to Freese.

The agency has "left this very convoluted system in place to use the telephone in order to change your banking information, but for the vast majority of seniors and members of the disability community, they're never going to be able to use it," Freese said.

Direct deposit fraud represents less than one-hundredth of one percent of benefits that are misdirected, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

The Social Security Administration plans to roll out a new secure digital form of identification as an alternative to traditional paper cards beginning early this summer.

The new digital feature will allow individuals who have either forgotten their Social Security number or who have lost their Social Security cards to access their personal number online through the agency's My Social Security website.

They will also be able to access their Social Security numbers through digital devices and display them as identification for "reasons other than handling Social Security matters," according to the agency.

With the new effort, the agency aims to reduce the inconveniences caused by lost or stolen cards, which currently requires individuals to apply for replacements either online or in person.

As a small business owner, Ramon van Meer said he's used to hearing people say they'd be willing to pay more for products made in America.

When President Donald Trump ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese imports by an additional 145%, van Meer decided to see if shoppers would put their money where their mouth is.

"I wanted to know the answer and then use it for my own company," the Afina founder told Business Insider.

So the serial entrepreneur set about finding US suppliers to make his best-selling product: a specialized filtered shower head.

Van Meer said his filters are made in the US, some additional materials are sourced in Vietnam, and the final product is made in China with a single supplier.

To move everything over to the US, he said he had to find four to six separate suppliers who would handle various aspects of the production process. All told, he found it would cost three times as much to produce — more than the cost of simply paying the tariff.

Armed with real numbers, he set out to do a test with two identical products, with the only difference being their origin and, critically, their price: visitors to Afina's website were presented with the option of a Chinese-made item for $129 or a US-made version for $239.

"I'm big on just testing it out with real data and real purchases," van Meer said. "Not asking customers, not a survey, not even add-to-carts."

"When somebody has to pay for it, that's the actual real data," he added.

After several days and more than 25,000 visitors, he said he sold 584 of the lower-priced shower heads and not one single purchase of a US-made version.

In a blog post that went viral, van Meer called the results "sobering."

"We wanted to believe customers would back American labor with their dollars. But when faced with a real decision — not a survey or a comment section — they didn't," he wrote.

Nowadays van Meer said he's spending most of his time trying to shift production out of China to a country with a lower tariff rate.

"Staying in China is not sustainable because even if they make a deal, we don't know what's going to happen," he said. "The United States is also not an option, because there's just no facilities that can make it."

The results were brutal:🚫 0 customers bought the U.S. version⬇️ Add-to-cart rate for US version was less than 1%📍 Over 3,500 bought the Asia-made version pic.twitter.com/pldVrsTYJ2

Van Meer said Afina currently has enough inventory in its US warehouses to last until August, at which point he would have to start charging for the tariff.

Asked whether he would roll that cost into the price or apply a surcharge, as other businesses have said they would do, van Meer said he hadn't yet decided.

"We'll probably do testing," he said.

Key Takeaways:

Veteran trader Peter Brandt suggests a potential Ethereum rally to $3,800–$4,800 if ETH breaks above a rising wedge pattern.

A short-term pullback may occur as the taker buy-sell ratio drops below one, signaling caution from futures traders.

Ethereum's native token Ether (ETH) opened its weekly candle at $1,807 on May 7, and now it is close to recording its highest 7-day returns of 38% since December 2020. 

Ether also surpassed its realized price for accumulating addresses ($1,900), which is the average cost basis for holders, signaling profits for users. As illustrated in the chart, most of the buying pressure for ETH came from Binance, which is currently the most active exchange for ETH traders. 

Elevated activity at Binance and an uptick in outflows reflect strong trader confidence, liquidity, and sustained bullish momentum in the current market. 

“Moonshot” rally to new highs for Ethereum

In a recent X post, veteran trader Peter Brandt highlighted a developing market structure that could pave the way for an Ethereum rally, provided the altcoin breaks through a key "congestion" pattern. Brandt identified a rising wedge formation on the chart—a pattern often considered bearish. 

However, he suggested that a breakout above this pattern could propel Ethereum's price toward the descending resistance line, targeting a range between $3,800 and $4,800. 

This analysis marks a notable shift in Brandt's outlook from 2024, aligning with the renewed optimism for the altcoin. 

Ethereum futures saw a 42% surge in open interest (OI), climbing from $21.3 billion to $30.4 billion between May 8 and May 11, 2025. Nearing its all-time high of $32 billion, this spike reflects heightened market activity and growing trader engagement. The rapid increase in OI signals strong interest in Ether futures, potentially paving the way for increased price volatility.

Ethereum's higher-time frame (HTF) chart reflects a price rise on the weekly chart, where the altcoin has jumped toward the 50 and 100-week exponential moving averages (EMAs) over the past couple of weeks. Historically, such a recovery marks a price bottom but could also signal the beginning of a small correction period after the EMAs retest.

Using Fibonacci retracement levels, ETH has retested the 0.5 to 0.618 range (orange box), which aligns with a price level of $2,500. This retest represents the first leg of the recovery, but a short-term pullback may occur before further bullish action unfolds.

With ETH prices moving at a parabolic rate over the past few days, liquidation heatmaps noted higher buy-side liquidity between $2,200 and $2,400, after a short-squeeze took prices up to $2,608.

Similarly, the taker buy-sell ratio is beginning to slow down and dropped below 1 on May 10. The ratio of buy volume divided by sell volume of takers in perpetual swap trades indicates futures sentiment, and a ratio below 1 implies short-term bearishness. 

Thus, traders could approach the coming days more cautiously, with ETH consolidating under the $2,500 level.

 Bitcoin rallied within 5% of its previous all-time high, and bulls expect the level to be conquered this week. 

Key points:

Bitcoin holds on to its recent gains, increasing the possibility of a retest of the all-time high at $109,588.

BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF records 19 days of successive inflows, showing solid demand. 

Select altcoins are showing strength, having broken out of their large basing patterns.

Bitcoin (BTC) made a decisive move above the psychologically crucial $100,000 level during the week, signaling that the bulls are back in the game. Buyers are trying to hold on to the 10% weekly gains over the weekend.

Bitcoin's rally has been backed by solid inflows into the BlackRock spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (IBIT). According to Farside Investors' data, the fund stretched its inflows streak to 19 days, with the latest trading week attracting $1.03 billion in inflows.

The rally was not limited to Bitcoin alone, as several altcoins also moved higher. That has prompted analysts to announce the start of an altseason, with some predicting sharp rallies in altcoins over the next few months. However, not everyone believes that an altseason has started because the altcoins have only made modest moves compared to the massive price erosion from their respective all-time highs.  

Could Bitcoin break out to a new all-time high and maintain it? If it does, let's study the charts of the cryptocurrencies that may move higher in the near term.

Bitcoin has been gradually inching toward the all-time high of $109,588, indicating that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits.

The rally has pushed the relative strength index (RSI) into the overbought zone, suggesting a correction or consolidation in the near term. Any pullback is expected to find support between $100,000 and the 20-day exponential moving average ($96,626). If the price rebounds off the support zone, it increases the possibility of a break above $109,588. If that happens, the BTC/USDT pair could surge toward $130,000.

Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair could plunge to the 50-day simple moving average ($88,962).

The pair continues to climb higher, but the bears are expected to fiercely defend the $107,000 to $109,588 zone. If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the 20-EMA is likely to act as strong support. A bounce off the 20-EMA signals that the bullish momentum remains intact. That enhances the prospects of a breakout above $109,588.

Sellers will have to tug the price below $100,000 to weaken the positive momentum. That opens the doors for a fall to $93,000 and subsequently to $83,000.

Ether (ETH) skyrocketed from $1,808 on May 8 to $2,600 on May 10, indicating aggressive buying by the bulls.

The up move pushed the RSI into the overbought territory, indicating a minor pullback or consolidation is possible in the near term. The first support on the downside is $2,320 and then $2,111. If the price turns up from the support levels, the ETH/USDT pair could extend the rally to $2,850 and later to $3,000.

The optimistic view will be invalidated in the near term if the price breaks below $2,111. That could result in a range formation between $1,754 and $2,600.

The bulls pushed the price above the $2,550 resistance but could not sustain the higher levels. A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. That suggests the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate the up move to continue. If the price turns up from the current level of the 20-EMA and breaks above $2,609, the rally could reach $3,000. 

A deeper correction could begin if the price continues lower and plummets below the 20-EMA. That could sink the pair toward the solid support at $2,111.

Dogecoin (DOGE) soared above the $0.21 overhead resistance on May 10, indicating a change in the short-term trend.

The rally is facing selling at $0.26, which could result in a retest of the breakout level of $0.21. If the price rebounds off $0.21 with strength, it suggests a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. That increases the likelihood of a rally to $0.31. 

If buyers want to prevent the upside, they will have to pull the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.19). If they do that, the DOGE/USDT pair could swing inside a large range between $0.26 and $0.14 for a while. 

The pair has turned down from $0.26, with immediate support at $0.22 and then at $0.21. If the price rebounds off the support zone, it suggests a positive sentiment where dips are being purchased. The bulls will then again try to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $0.26.

Conversely, a drop below $0.21 signals that the bulls are rushing to the exit. That could pull the price to the 50-day SMA.

Pepe (PEPE) rallied sharply from the 50-day SMA ($0.000008) and broke above the $0.000011 overhead resistance on May 8.

The rally has pushed the RSI into the overbought zone, signaling a pullback may be around the corner. The PEPE/USDT pair could drop to the breakout level of $0.000011. If the price rebounds off $0.000011, it suggests that the bulls have flipped the level into support. That improves the prospects for a rally to $0.000017 and then to $0.000020.

This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($0.000009).

The 4-hour chart shows that the bears are aggressively defending the $0.000014 level. That could pull the price down to the 20-EMA, which is a vital level to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, the bulls will make another attempt to shove the pair above $0.000014. If they can pull it off, the pair could ascend to $0.000017.

On the contrary, a break and close below the 20-EMA could sink the pair to $0.000011. Buyers are expected to defend the $0.000011 level with all their might because a slide below it may extend the pullback to the 50-SMA.

Cosmos (ATOM) broke out of the large base when it closed above $5.15 on May 10. That signals a potential trend change.

However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will try to pull the price back below the $5.15 level. If they manage to do that, the aggressive bulls may get trapped, pulling the price to the moving averages. 

Alternatively, if buyers sustain the price above $5.15, the ATOM/USDT pair could pick up momentum and rally to $6.50. Sellers will try to halt the up move at $6.50, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could rally to $7.50.

The sharp rally has pushed the RSI into the overbought zone on the 4-hour chart, suggesting a short-term correction or consolidation. The bulls will have to defend the critical $5.15 level if they want to keep the positive momentum intact. If they manage to do that, the pair could rally to $6.60.

Contrarily, a break and close below $5.15 could pull the price down to the 20-EMA. This is an important level to watch out for because a break below it may sink the pair to $4.70.

The rally has pushed the RSI into the overbought zone, signaling a pullback may be around the corner. The PEPEUSDT pair could drop to the breakout level of $0.000011. If the price rebounds off $0.000011, it suggests that the bulls have flipped the level into support. That improves the prospects for a rally to $0.000017 and then to $0.000020.

If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, the bulls will make another attempt to shove the pair above $0.000014. If they can pull it off, the pair could ascend to $0.000017.

On the contrary, a break and close below the 20-EMA could sink the pair to $0.000011. Buyers are expected to defend the $0.000011 level with all their might because a slide below it may extend the pullback to the 50-SMA.

Cosmos price prediction

Cosmos ATOMUSD broke out of the large base when it closed above $5.15 on May 10. That signals a potential trend change.

However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will try to pull the price back below the $5.15 level. If they manage to do that, the aggressive bulls may get trapped, pulling the price to the moving averages. 

Alternatively, if buyers sustain the price above $5.15, the ATOMUSDT pair could pick up momentum and rally to $6.50. Sellers will try to halt the up move at $6.50, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could rally to $7.50.

The sharp rally has pushed the RSI into the overbought zone on the 4-hour chart, suggesting a short-term correction or consolidation. The bulls will have to defend the critical $5.15 level if they want to keep the positive momentum intact. If they manage to do that, the pair could rally to $6.60.

Contrarily, a break and close below $5.15 could pull the price down to the 20-EMA. This is an important level to watch out for because a break below it may sink the pair to $4.70.

Shiba Inu rose to fame as a meme-powered crypto movement, drawing massive retail attention through community hype and speculative growth. But as market maturity sets in and investor expectations evolve, many Shiba holders are now rethinking their approach. For some, that means looking beyond meme tokens toward infrastructure projects with long-term technical potential.

That pivot is increasingly leading them to Bitcoin Solaris, a blockchain platform that pairs high performance with serious architecture — most notably, its dual-layer system capable of processing over 10,000 transactions per second. With energy-efficient consensus, mobile-first mining, and real utility built into the protocol, Bitcoin Solaris is drawing the attention of not just speculators — but analysts, developers, and infrastructure-focused investors alike.

The appeal of tokens like Shiba Inu was always based on community and culture, not underlying tech. But after several market cycles, more investors are prioritizing sustainability, accessibility, and real-world application. Many are asking: what will matter five years from now?



Bitcoin Solaris provides an answer by delivering a blockchain that solves some of the core limitations meme tokens and even major Layer-1s have yet to overcome: speed, decentralization, and accessible participation.

At the heart of Bitcoin Solaris is a dual-layer blockchain that separates security from throughput:

These two layers operate in tandem. There are no bridges or separate chains. Smart contracts can access base data directly, and mining rewards flow across both layers depending on contribution.

This structure allows Bitcoin Solaris to reach 10,000+ TPS, with 2-second transaction finality — making it faster than Solana, more flexible than Ethereum, and fundamentally more usable than meme tokens like Shiba Inu.

Technical analysts have taken particular interest in the Helios Consensus Mechanism (HCM), a hybrid protocol that integrates:

The combination creates a network that performs under load, avoids centralization, and doesn't rely on high-powered machines. It scales horizontally and works across devices — including smartphones.

Bitcoin Solaris doesn't just cater to developers or large holders. Through its upcoming Nova App, everyday users can mine directly from their phones. No GPUs. No staking lockups. No third-party pools.



The app leverages unused device storage (1–5 GB) and background CPU to contribute to consensus. This makes Bitcoin Solaris one of the few Layer-1 blockchains to integrate native mobile mining — offering utility and inclusion far beyond what tokens like SHIB currently support.

To see why Bitcoin Solaris is gaining traction among technically focused investors, watch this breakdown by Crypto Volt, which explains architecture, speed, and why this is more than just another L1.

Bitcoin Solaris mirrors Bitcoin's deflationary supply model, with a fixed cap of 21 million BTC-S tokens. There's no inflation schedule or artificial burning.

The presale is now in Phase 2, with tokens priced at 2 USDT. Phase 3 will raise the price to 3 USDT, marking a significant shift as ecosystem components like the Nova App go live and exchange listings begin.

Of the total supply, 4.2 million tokens (20%) are reserved for the presale. This structure ensures clean, early access for retail participants — without insider pricing or hidden lockups.

For those who demand transparency, Bitcoin Solaris delivers it through independent verification:

The codebase, consensus rules, and token allocations are all public. There's nothing to hide — and plenty to explore.

Shiba Inu brought millions into crypto — but the next wave of growth will be led by infrastructure. Bitcoin Solaris offers something meme coins never could: fast, scalable, transparent blockchain technology with real earning mechanisms and on-chain utility.

As former meme investors pivot to deeper projects, Bitcoin Solaris stands out as a platform not just built for fun — but built to last.

 Ethereum's bullish fractals, emerging altseason signals, and strength over SOL, XRP fuel $10,000 ETH price target speculation. 

Key takeaways:

Ether has rebounded from key parabolic and triangle support levels, reviving the case for a $10,000 breakout.

Historical fractals and RSI recovery mirror past pre-rally setups seen in 2016 and 2020.

Altseason signals and strength against rivals like SOL and XRP boost Ethereum's potential to outperform.

Ether (ETH), Ethereum's native token, has soared over 44% in just three days to surpass $2,600 on May 11, fueling fresh speculation of a run toward $10,000 in the coming months. 

A mix of fractal setups as well as Ether's potential to outperform its top-ranking rivals, Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP (XRP), are serving as some catalysts behind the five-figure price prediction.

Ether's long-term price action continues to follow a parabolic curve that has defined its major market cycles since 2015. 

As of May 2025, ETH has rebounded from the curve's lower boundary near $2,100 — a historically significant support zone that has previously triggered major rallies. 

If this parabolic trajectory holds, Ethereum's next move could be toward the upper boundary of the curve, which currently intersects near the $10,000 level. 

Supporting this view, analyst MilkyBull Crypto highlights a similar setup on Ethereum's monthly chart, noting that ETH's rally to $10,000 “can't be ruled out technically.”

Combined with RSI recovery from a multi-year support zone near 40, the setup adds further weight to the five-figure price target.

The bullish outlook for Ethereum is gaining traction as analysts anticipate an altcoin season in the coming months. 

Chartist Mister Crypto, for instance, argues that altcoins like ETH may rally 40% in a single day amid capital rotation from Bitcoin. 

The Altcoin Season Index, which has broken out of a downtrend just below the 29 level, signals a potential shift away from Bitcoin dominance. While still in “Bitcoin Season” territory (below 25), the breakout suggests altcoins like ETH may soon begin to outperform.

Additionally, Ethereum's top blockchain rival, Solana, is painting a rising wedge pattern against Ether, furthering its potential to decline in the coming weeks.

The same picture can be seen against XRP, suggesting that more capital may flow toward Ethereum from rival altcoins in the coming days or weeks. 

As of May, Ether is reclaiming the lower trendline of its multi-year symmetrical triangle after a brief breakdown in March, while bouncing off its 200-2W exponential moving average (200-2W EMA; the blue wave) support. 

ETH's rebound confirms a bullish rejection, validating the ongoing consolidation structure.

This setup closely resembles ETH's past macro consolidations, namely the 2016 bull flag and the 2018–2020 falling wedge, both of which preceded major breakouts to new all-time highs.

A breakout above the current triangle consolidation could follow a similar trajectory, increasing the probability of ETH reaching the $10,000 mark — and even $20,000 if the breakout pans out per the rules of technical analysis.

Howard Wu is the founder of Aleo and CEO of Provable, a company building tools for confidential, compliant payments and developer infrastructure on zero-knowledge blockchains. A UC Berkeley graduate with a background in cryptography and verifiable computing, Wu has co-authored Zexe and DIZK—zero-knowledge systems adopted by Ethereum, Zcash, and others.

The views expressed here are his own and do not necessarily represent those of Decrypt.

When you pay with a stablecoin like USDC, you may be giving up more than just money. 

As long as you're transacting on a public blockchain, a merchant—or anyone, for that matter—can view your wallet, analyze your past transactions, and use or sell your personal financial history.

This feature isn't a minor inconvenience. It's why serious institutions, from major banks to government entities, hesitate to adopt blockchain technology. 

Financial entities, corporations, and sovereign funds would be worse off if sensitive information, such as treasury operations, trading strategies, and quarterly financial movements, became public knowledge. 

What's needed is a way for these systems to transact confidentially and securely, while demonstrating compliance.

Fortunately, a solution has been emerging for some time. 

Zero-knowledge proofs, a breakthrough in cryptography, offer a way to preserve the open, decentralized nature of blockchains while introducing the confidentiality and control that serious institutions require. 

Public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum were designed to prioritize transparency and openness. This works well for censorship resistance and trustless systems that assume everyone involved is better off with everything out in the open. 

But for highly regulated organizations or strategically discrete financial entities, this radical transparency becomes a structural weakness.

For instance, most banks operate under confidentiality norms enforced by legal contractual obligations, and payment providers must protect user data under existing frameworks.

As a result, publicly revealing counterparty exposure or transaction timing can create market manipulation risks and breach fiduciary duties. 

Similarly, if a government agency used public rails to coordinate emergency aid or military procurement, adversaries could infer national priorities or operational timelines from transaction metadata alone. 

In both cases, the consequences of an information breach could be economically or strategically catastrophic.

Even attempts to “mask” activity using pseudonymous wallets or mixers have proven inadequate. Chain surveillance tools routinely de-anonymize addresses by mapping wallet interactions and analyzing on-chain behavior. 

In effect, using public blockchains for institutional finance today is like trying to run a business on a public spreadsheet that anyone worldwide can monitor and scrape.

Zero-knowledge proofs offer a cryptographic alternative to the binary choice between full transparency and complete opacity. 

ZKPs allow one party to mathematically prove a statement is true without revealing the underlying data that makes it true. 

For example, a company can prove that its on-chain assets exceed its liabilities without revealing wallet addresses or asset breakdowns. 

In practical terms, ZKPs enable selective disclosure, meaning institutions can comply with regulatory obligations, such as AML screening or sanctions checks, while still preserving the confidentiality of their operational data. 

Instead of posting raw data to the chain, they post a proof that certain conditions have been met, which is publicly verifiable without ever exposing a transaction or user's underlying details.

This is an absolute game-changer. For the first time in history, entities can prove who they are, what they have, or what they've done without revealing any of this information directly. 

Until recently, identity, compliance, solvency, and governance have required disclosure, but with zero-knowledge technology, they require only proof. As a result, institutions no longer have to choose between operational secrecy and on-chain accountability. 

Institutions that have tried to use public blockchains for serious applications have already discovered these limitations firsthand. As a result, we're now seeing a proliferation of zk-based solutions tailor-built for real-world, institutional needs.

One of the latest examples is JP Morgan's Kinexys, a private blockchain designed for tokenized cash settlements and interbank messaging. Kinexys allows participants to tokenize assets and execute transactions with confidentiality guarantees enforced at the protocol level. 

Compliance checks, identity attestations, and settlement proofs can be performed without disclosing underlying business data. 

The system aligns with the privacy requirements of large financial institutions, which is why it has been integrated into the Partior cross-border settlement network alongside DBS and Standard Chartered.

The fact that one of the world's most conservative banks felt the need to build its own private blockchain infrastructure speaks volumes—and they are far from alone. 

Beyond the explosion in zk-focused businesses and startups, major government entities from the U.S. Department of Defense to the European Commission are exploring ways to leverage ZKP for secure data sharing in high-stakes environments. 

Clearly, institutions want the benefits of programmable money and atomic settlement, but not at the expense of leaking proprietary information.

When every transaction is visible to the world, businesses and governments face an impossible trade-off between leveraging next-generation financial infrastructure and protecting sensitive information. 

For the technology to underpin payroll, sovereign reserves, cross-border commerce, and institutional settlement networks, it must evolve to meet the standards of privacy and risk control expected in high-stakes finance.

Privacy is not a side quest. It is the cornerstone of scalable, secure, and compliant finance. 

If we want the world's leading financial institutions and public entities to embrace digital assets fully, the blockchain industry must meet them where they are, with cryptographic tools that align with how they operate. 

Zero-knowledge technology is how we get there.

2025 has seen the crypto market heat up significantly, with Ethereum (ETH) leading the charge and igniting an altcoin rally. The rising prices of altcoins have created a surge in interest across the market, with Ethereum's recent performance acting as a catalyst for further growth. However, while Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing a major bull run, Coldware (COLD) is also grabbing attention with its upcoming hardware release — the Larna 2400 mobile device — which could set Coldware apart from its competitors and fuel its growth in the RWA (Real-World Asset) tokenization sector.

Coldware's upcoming Larna 2400 mobile device is designed to bring Web3 functionality to mobile users in a seamless and accessible way. As Ethereum continues to push the crypto market to new heights, Coldware is taking the next big step in ensuring that decentralized finance and Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization reach a broader audience. The Larna 2400 will empower users to engage with RWA tokenization directly from their mobile devices, making blockchain technology more accessible and usable for everyday applications.

Coldware's hardware release is expected to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and the broader financial markets, allowing for easy and secure tokenization of real-world assets such as real estate, commodities, and more. By providing users with a secure way to manage and trade assets, Coldware (COLD) is making RWA tokenization more practical and relevant than ever before.

Ethereum's price surge has been nothing short of spectacular, crossing the $2,450 mark and drawing attention from institutional investors and retail traders alike. Ethereum's rise is propelled by its Pectra upgrade, which has made the Ethereum network more scalable and user-friendly. The recent price increase of 10% in just a few days highlights the immense potential of Ethereum, and as it continues to rise, the crypto market as a whole is benefiting from the momentum.

The Pectra upgrade has improved the network's efficiency, making it more attractive for decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. This, coupled with Ethereum's continued dominance, has led many analysts to predict that Ethereum may soon approach its all-time high of $4,864.06. Ethereum's performance and the growing market interest have set the stage for an altcoin season, with many altcoins like Solana (SOL) also gaining significant traction.

However, amidst this bullish rally, Coldware (COLD) has positioned itself to stand out with the Larna 2400 mobile device — a revolutionary Web3 hardware release that could significantly impact the landscape of decentralized finance and asset tokenization.

While Ethereum's continued success is setting the stage for an altcoin rally, Coldware's Larna 2400 device will play a pivotal role in distinguishing Coldware (COLD) from other players in the market. Coldware's hardware release could complement Ethereum's ongoing advancements, providing a new layer of functionality for blockchain-based finance and asset tokenization.

As Ethereum pushes past its previous price highs and other altcoins experience significant growth, Coldware is aligning itself for the future of decentralized finance. The integration of RWA tokenization with Coldware's mobile device is expected to be a game-changer, positioning Coldware (COLD) as a market leader in a rapidly evolving space.

The rise of Ethereum has undoubtedly set the tone for 2025, and Coldware (COLD) is poised to ride this wave of momentum. While Ethereum's rise shows no signs of slowing down, Coldware's Web3 hardware release will enable a seamless experience for users to engage in RWA tokenization, positioning it as a leader in this new frontier.

As the market continues to evolve, Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself to become a central player in the decentralized finance ecosystem. With its Larna 2400 release on the horizon, Coldware is set to separate itself from other altcoin rivals and become a leader in the space, alongside Ethereum (ETH).

 Ethereum's Pectra upgrade introduces offchain wallet delegation via EIP-7702, allowing attackers to drain funds using just a signed message. 

Ethereum's latest network upgrade, Pectra, introduced powerful new features aimed at improving scalability and smart account functionality — but it also opened a dangerous new attack vector that could allow hackers to drain funds from user wallets using only an offchain signature.

Under the Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7 at epoch 364032, attackers can exploit a new transaction type to take control of externally owned accounts (EOAs) without requiring the user to sign an onchain transaction.

Arda Usman, a Solidity smart contract auditor, confirmed to Cointelegraph that “it becomes possible for an attacker to drain an EOA's funds using only an offchain signed message (no direct onchain transaction signed by the user).”

At the center of the risk is EIP-7702, a core component of the Pectra upgrade. The Ethereum Improvement Proposal introduces the SetCode transaction (type 0x04), which enables users to delegate control of their wallet to another contract simply by signing a message.

If an attacker obtains this signature — say, via a phishing site — they can overwrite the wallet's code with a small proxy that forwards calls to their malicious contract.

“Once the code is set,” Usman explained, “the attacker can invoke that code to transfer out the account's ETH or tokens—all without the user ever signing a normal transfer transaction.”

Yehor Rudytsia, onchain researcher at Hacken, noted that this new transaction type introduced by Pectra allows arbitrary code to be installed on the user's account, essentially turning their wallet into a programmable smart contract.

“This tx type allows the user to set arbitrary code (smart contract) to be able to execute operations on the user's behalf,” Rudytsia said.

Before Pectra, wallets could not be modified without a transaction signed directly by the user. Now, a simple offchain signature can install code that delegates complete control to an attacker's contract.

“Pre-Pectra, users needed to send transaction (not sign message) to allow their funds to be moved… Post-Pectra, any operation may be executed from the contract which user approved via SET_CODE,” Rudytsia explained.

The threat is real and immediate. “Pectra activated May 7, 2025. From that moment, any valid delegation signature is actionable,” Usman warned. He added that smart contracts relying on outdated assumptions, such as using tx.origin or basic EOA-only checks, are particularly vulnerable.

Wallets and interfaces that fail to detect or properly represent these new transaction types are most at risk. Rudytsia warned that “wallets are vulnerable if they do not analyze Ethereum's transaction types,” especially transaction type 0x04.

He emphasized that wallet engines must clearly display delegation requests and flag any suspicious addresses.

This new form of attack can be easily executed through common offchain interactions like phishing emails, fake DApps, or Discord scams.

“We believe it will be the most popular attack vector regarding these breaking changes introduced by Pectra,” Rudytsia said. “From now on, users have to carefully validate what they are going to sign.”

Hardware wallets are no longer inherently safer, Rudytsia said. He added that hardware wallets from now on are at the same risk as hot wallets from the perspective of signing malicious messages. “If done—all the funds are gone in a moment.”

There are ways to stay safe, but they require awareness. “Users should not sign the messages they do not understand,” Rudytsia advised. He also urged wallet developers to provide clear warnings when users are asked to sign a delegation message.

Special caution should be taken with new delegation signature formats introduced by EIP-7702, which are not compatible with existing EIP-191 or EIP-712 standards. These messages often appear as simple 32-byte hashes and may bypass normal wallet warnings.

“If a message includes your account nonce, it's probably affecting your account directly,” Usman warned. “Normal sign-in messages or offchain commitments don't usually involve your nonce.”

Adding to the risk, EIP-7702 allows for signatures with chain_id = 0, meaning the signed message can be replayed on any Ethereum-compatible chain. “Understand it can be used anywhere,” Usman said.

While multisignature wallets remain more secure under this upgrade, thanks to their requirement for multiple signers, single-key wallets — hardware or otherwise — must adopt new signature parsing and red-flagging tools to prevent potential exploitation.

Alongside EIP-7702, Pectra also included EIP-7251, which raised Ethereum's validator staking limit from 32 to 2,048 ETH, and EIP-7691, which increases the number of data blobs per block for better layer-2 scalability.

 Worldcoin's Orb Mini device was met with mockery across Crypto Twitter, as critics questioned its ethics and usefulness. 

Worldcoin's latest hardware, the Orb Mini, aimed at enabling portable human verification, has been met with ridicule across Crypto Twitter.

Launched with the slogan “It goes where you go,” the device has instead triggered dystopian comparisons and widespread mockery for its unsettling implications and unclear use case.

“The thing about humans is they can tell when a human is in front of them,” Alicia Katz from decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Euler Finance wrote on X.

“When something is slightly off, they can experience the uncanny valley, an uncomfortable feeling similar to when your date tries to scan your eyeball,” she added.

Another user quipped, “Is this so you can register your friends?” likening the device to a sci-fi prop rather than a serious identity solution.

The Orb Mini is a portable iris-scanning device that creates a unique World ID for users stored on the blockchain. Resembling a smartphone with visible eye sensors, it's a smaller, more accessible version of Worldcoin's original Orb.

Unveiled at the “At Last” event in San Francisco on April 30, the device is part of a broader push by Tools for Humanity, which also plans to roll out 7,500 Orb units across the US by year-end.

Several prominent voices raised concerns over security, ethics, and basic practicality.

“What real-life problem does this solve?” one user asked, while others mocked its vulnerability to spoofing, with one tweet suggesting the device “could be fooled by a half-decent AI render of a human.”

In the same thread, one user sarcastically recommended a “rectal probe” for more secure identity checks, claiming, “Every human's anal print is unique.”

Critics also slammed the device's social implications. Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten called the Orb Mini a “creepy dystopia-shilling” tool, suggesting the product reflects insecurity among its creators rather than solving any real trust issue.

Worldcoin's push to make biometric identity tools mainstream continues to face resistance, especially as privacy advocates raise questions about decentralization, surveillance, and bodily autonomy.

On May 5, the company, backed by Sam Altman's Tools for Humanity, faced challenges in Indonesia after local regulators temporarily suspended its registration certificates.

Several global regulators have pushed back on World's operations since its launch in July 2023, with governments like Germany, Kenya and Brazil expressing concerns over potential risks to the security of users' biometric data.

Key Points

Bitcoin (BTC 0.50%) is up about 25% in the last 30 days alone. It's more likely than not to continue rising, and there's one huge and undeniable reason that makes that the case.

So, without further ado, here's why the rest of 2025 is probably going to be a great time for holders.

We all look at the performance of our investments. The brokerage websites and applications make it easy to see exactly how your favorite stock or cryptocurrency is performing relative to your cost basis. Total gains are denoted in green, and losses in red.

The temptation to sell one of your holdings is much higher when your total return is negative. Conversely, it's fairly easy to continue retaining an investment when it's obvious that your (genius) investment thesis is playing out, as shown by a healthy gain. If you're like most people, you probably take a look at the price chart of your investments from time to time, whether you're holding them at a loss or a gain. Upward-climbing charts are, at least psychologically, proof that your gains will continue to grow, whereas tumbling lines on the chart are sufficient to cement your dread that your losses will deepen, prompting you to sell.

Putting aside the invalidity of short-term price-based reasoning about whether to buy, hold, or sell an asset, it's undeniable that investors are an emotional bunch that tend not to be able to maintain a long-term mindset about their holdings when faced with the anxiety of experiencing losses. At the same time, when most of the investors who hold an asset are holding it at a gain rather than a loss, incredible things can happen -- and that's exactly what's happening with Bitcoin right now.

As of May 5, according to data from Glassnode, a cryptocurrency data provider, at the price of $95,000 per coin, about 88% of all Bitcoin wallets were holding Bitcoin at a gain rather than a loss. And that's the huge reason why it's likely to keep climbing.

The price of the coin is currently more than $103,000. The overwhelming majority of Bitcoin's holders are not under any emotional pressure to cut their losses whatsoever. That means they are far more likely to continue holding and adding to their positions than they are to sell.

That is going to continue driving the coin's price even higher in the short term, even before taking any of the other powerful drivers for its value into account.

It is very unlikely that the price of Bitcoin will trend upward forever solely on the basis of most holders having an unrealized profit this month. There will probably be some macroeconomic events that are able to crack the market's bullish sentiment, causing some investors to sell. In other words, Bitcoin is destined to experience a crash or a sharp fall at some point in the future, and it is very likely that the decline will be so sharp that many investors sell their holdings at a loss and swear off cryptocurrencies altogether.

That doesn't detract from the long-term thesis for buying and holding Bitcoin, but it's a fact of life that assets go through cycles of being heavily favored and disfavored.

The way to deal with this reality is to have a plan for investing during both the asset's good times and also its hard times. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) with small amounts of capital when the market is practically euphoric about Bitcoin, like now, is a way to make sure you won't get wiped out to the point of feeling bad if there's a decline. At the same time, keeping some of your capital in reserve to buy the dips in the coin's price is also a good idea because doing so will enable you to capture upside when other investors are panicking.

The core pillar of this two-handed strategy is to hold your coins for the long term, which in this case means at least four years or so, but preferably closer to 40 years or so. The longer you can diligently accumulate Bitcoin, the more gain you will get from its inherent and ever-escalating scarcity, as well as medium-term drivers like institutional and sovereign adoption. Detach your investing habits from your emotions, and it won't matter how many other investors are holding Bitcoin at a gain or a loss -- you will be taking advantage of its value-generating capabilities all the while, regardless.

 A critical exploit has drained $2.15 million in MBU tokens from Mobius smart contracts on BNB Chain. 

Hackers drained over $2.15 million from Mobius Token ($MBU) smart contracts on the BNB Chain in a targeted exploit detected early May 11, according to security firm Cyvers Alerts.

The attacker deployed the contract from address 0xb32a53... at 07:31:38 UTC and initiated the exploit at 07:33:56 UTC, draining funds from the victim wallet 0xb5252f...

Cyvers confirmed to Cointelegraph that the attacker used contract 0x631adf... to execute a series of malicious transactions. The smart contract drained 28.5 million MBU tokens and converted them into stablecoins, resulting in a net loss of $2,152,219.99 for the victim.

In total, the attacker stole 28.5 million MBU tokens and converted them to $2.15 million worth of USDT.

Cyvers labeled the exploit as “critical” and noted the attacker's use of suspicious contract code and abnormal transaction patterns.

The attacker's wallet remains active and has retained the stolen funds as of publication. Mobius Token's team has not yet released an official statement.

“Two minutes prior to the exploit, our system identified a deployment of a malicious smart contract that eventually targeted the Mobius Token smart contracts,” Cyvers wrote on X.

In April 2025, blockchain security firm PeckShield reported that the space saw nearly $360 million in digital assets stolen across 18 hacking incidents. 

April's losses show a 990% increase compared to March, when crypto lost to hacks totalled about $33 million. The largest chunk of the losses came from an unauthorized Bitcoin transfer. 

On April 28, blockchain investigator ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer of $330 million in BTC. The investigator later confirmed that the transfer was a social engineering attack targeting an elderly individual in the United States.

The EOS blockchain has been making waves in the cryptocurrency world, capturing the attention of young, crypto-curious investors eager to stay ahead of the curve. Known for its scalability and developer-friendly environment, EOS is positioning itself as a key player in the decentralized application (dApp) space. But why does this matter, and what are the implications for the broader crypto market?

EOS has consistently been recognized for its ability to process transactions at high speeds and low costs, a critical advantage in a market where scalability challenges often hinder growth. Unlike many other blockchains, EOS employs a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, which allows for faster and more efficient validation of transactions. This unique approach has attracted developers looking to build dApps that require high throughput and reliability.

Scalability: EOS can handle thousands of transactions per second, making it ideal for applications with high user demand.

Developer-Friendly Tools: The platform offers robust tools and resources, simplifying the process of building and deploying dApps.

Low Transaction Costs: EOS eliminates the need for gas fees, making it more accessible for users and developers alike.

In recent months, EOS has seen a surge in activity, with several high-profile projects choosing the blockchain for their operations. This uptick in adoption is a testament to the platform's growing reputation as a reliable and efficient solution for decentralized applications.

"EOS is setting a new standard for blockchain scalability and usability," said a leading blockchain analyst. "Its ability to support complex applications without compromising on speed or cost is a game-changer for the industry."

For crypto-savvy investors, EOS represents an opportunity to capitalize on a blockchain that is not only technologically advanced but also gaining real-world traction. As the demand for scalable and cost-effective solutions continues to grow, platforms like EOS are likely to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of the crypto ecosystem.

Increased Competition: EOS's success could spur other blockchains to innovate, driving overall market growth.

Enhanced Adoption: As more developers and businesses turn to EOS, the platform's token could see increased utility and demand.

Long-Term Potential: With its focus on scalability and usability, EOS is well-positioned to remain a key player in the blockchain space.

The rise of EOS underscores the importance of scalability and user-centric design in the blockchain industry. For young investors looking to stay ahead, understanding the dynamics of platforms like EOS is crucial. As the crypto market continues to evolve, EOS's innovative approach could serve as a blueprint for the next generation of blockchain solutions.

After weeks of sideways consolidation and uncertainty, Ethereum appears to have flipped a major psychological and technical corner. Bullish momentum in the past five days has caused Ethereum's price action to surge past the $2,200 level with conviction, rising more than 32% in the past seven days alone. The breakout comes as Bitcoin crossed the six-figure mark again, lifting the broader crypto market along with it.

According to technical analysis of Ethereum's daily candlestick chart, this rally is more than just a reaction to Bitcoin; it is the start of a new long-term uptrend.

$2,200 Breakout Confirms Strength, Analyst Declares End Of Bear Market 

The recent surge has lifted Ethereum well beyond $2,000, a price level that acted as a ceiling in late March and early April. According to technical analysis posted on the TradingView platform by crypto analyst MasterAnanda, Ethereum's bear market is finally over. 

This comment was made in light of what the analyst called a real bullish action, coupled with really high volume in the past few days. This, in turn, confirms a very strong high in the coming weeks and days, where Ethereum will grow daily non-stop for months.

The recent rally has taken the price above the August 5, 2024, and February 3, 2025 lows, highlighted on a chart posted by the analyst on TradingView. The chart also shows that Ethereum broke free convincingly from a steep descending channel pattern that had trapped its price for months. 

The breakout is convincing because a large green candle accompanied by unusually high trading volume marked the breakout, lending credibility to the view that the bear phase is now over.

“This is only the start,” the analyst wrote, adding that Ethereum's path toward reclaiming its all-time highs is already underway.

$5,791 An ‘Easy' Target, $10,000 Before 2026 ‘Doable'

According to MasterAnanda's analysis, the current rally could easily carry Ethereum to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level near $5,791.78. He describes this target as “easy”, given the strength of the breakout and the capital inflow that appears to be building behind it. 

Reaching the $5,791 price target would translate to a breakout to uncharted price territories above Ethereum's current all-time high of $4,878. However, the prediction doesn't stop there. A $10,000 Ethereum is not only possible but likely before the end of 2025 due to institutional money and retail sentiment flooding into the market.

The chart illustrates Ethereum's recovery path with various Fibonacci levels mapped out, showing resistance and retracement points ranging from $2,421 at the 0.382 extension up to $5,791 at the 1.618 extension. 

The analyst noted that around $250 billion in capital could eventually flow into the crypto market during this wave, with $10 to $15 billion already in play. He argues that the euphoric phase will begin once the remaining capital enters.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,395.

The excavation also turned up human remains.

Archaeologists recently found the lost ruins of a ceremonial temple—covered in sand and 4,000 to 5,000 years old—in northwestern Peru. The excavation team first discovered the walls, and subsequently unearthed a mix of features indicating that the structure was once a temple. And then came the skeletal remains of three adults tucked between walls. 

“We may be facing a 5,000-year-old religious site that constitutes an architectural space defined by walls built by rammed earth,” Luis Armando Muro Ynoñán, director of the Cultural Landscapes Archaeological Project of Ucupe — Valle de Zaña, said in a translated statement from the Peruvian Ministry of Culture.

The oldest portion of the site features not only the up-to-5,000-year-old walls, but also various architectural features that help define the site as a ceremonial temple. “We have what would have been a central staircase from which one would ascend to a kind of stage in the central part,” Muro Ynoñán said, noting that the stage could have hosted ritual performances in front of an audience.

The ruins include friezes with images of cats, the claws of a reptile, and a human body with the head of a bird. The designs are preserved in “fine plaster,” which has helped scientists nail down the exact age of the site and the origins of the religion. The team plans to study the chemical makeup of the pigments in the murals painted on the walls to help confirm how old the site is this fall. 

But it wasn't just architecture located in these sand dunes—there were human remains, too. According to Reuters, the excavation team located the remains of three adult bodies positioned between the walls of the temple. Nearby was also a bundle wrapped in linen that potentially served as an offering. 

“It was amazing,” said Muro Ynoñán, according to a statement from the Field Museum in Chicago. “This discovery tells us about the early origins of religion in Peru. We still know very little about how and under which circumstances complex belief systems emerged in the Andes, and now we have evidence about some of the earliest religious spaces that people were creating in this part of the world.” 

Muro Ynoñán said that the newfound temple likely contains more information about a people group that predated the known inhabitants of the region. “We don't know what these people called themselves,” he said, “or how other people referred to them. All we know about them comes from what they created: their houses, temples, and funerary goods.”

The excavation team was invited to the site after the local government observed looting in the area. “It was so surprising that these very ancient structures were so close to the modern surface,” Muro Ynoñán said. “We think that a large temple was built into the side of the mountain, and we've found one section of it.” 

Archaeologists also found a more recent temple, dated to sometime between 600 and 700 A.D. Muro Ynoñán believes the second site comes from the Moche culture. This one also features remains—those of a young child, possibly between 5 and 6 years old—but from a more recent time.

“The people here created complex religious systems and perceptions about their cosmos,” Muro Ynoñán said. “Religion was an important aspect of the emergence of political authority.”

President Donald Trump has fired Shira Perlmutter, who leads the U.S. Copyright Office.

The firing was reported by CBS News and Politico, and seemingly confirmed by a statement from Representative Joe Morelle, the top Democrat on the Committee for House Administration.

“Donald Trump's termination of Register of Copyrights, Shira Perlmutter, is a brazen, unprecedented power grab with no legal basis,” Morelle said. “It is surely no coincidence he acted less than a day after she refused to rubber-stamp Elon Musk's efforts to mine troves of copyrighted works to train AI models.”

Perlmutter took over the Copyright Office in 2020, during the first Trump administration. She was appointed by Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, who Trump also fired this week.

Trump alluded to the news on his social network Truth Social, when he “ReTruthed” a post from attorney Mike Davis linking to the CBS News article. (Confusingly, Davis seemed to criticize the firing, writing, “Now tech bros are going to attempt to steal creators' copyrights for AI profits.”)

As for how this ties into Musk (a Trump ally) and AI, Morelle linked to a pre-publication version of a U.S. Copyright Office report released this week that focuses on copyright and artificial intelligence. (In fact, it's actually part three of a longer report.)

In it, the Copyright Office says that while it's “not possible to prejudge” the outcome of individual cases, there are limitations on how much AI companies can count on “fair use” as a defense when they train their models on copyrighted content. For example, the report says research and analysis would probably be allowed.

“But making commercial use of vast troves of copyrighted works to produce expressive content that competes with them in existing markets, especially where this is accomplished through illegal access, goes beyond established fair use boundaries,” it continues.

The Copyright Office goes on to suggest that government intervention “would be premature at this time,” but it expresses hope that “licensing markets” where AI companies pay copyright holders for access to their content “should continue to develop,” adding that “alternative approaches such as extended collective licensing should be considered to address any market failure.”

AI companies including OpenAI currently face a number of lawsuits accusing them of copyright infringement, and OpenAI has also called for the U.S. government to codify a copyright strategy that gives AI companies leeway through fair use.

Musk, meanwhile, is both a co-founder of OpenAI and of a competing startup, xAI (which is merging with the former Twitter). He recently expressed support for Square founder Jack Dorsey's call to “delete all IP law.”

But yea, a single class probably isn't sufficient and also I image a lot of embedded companies have a preference to hire someone already familiar with the chip they are targeting and the toolchain for the stack. I also see a lot of asking for experience with RTOS, which in my class, we didn't use an RTOS.


reply



I did some initial requirements work on a system to monitor continuous-web papermaking machinery; the line had to be stopped, physically and completely, within 100ms if anything went wrong, because an uncontained web of paper can literally cut people in half.  They wanted, in order to be able to hire, to use one of the embedded flavors of a well-known consumer-grade OS, and I had to prove to them that there was no way to make any of them safe, at any cost.  And they knew their hardware, because they had built it themselves.The absolute last resort is a watchdog timer that hits the reset button if N milliseconds go by without the software telling it it's okay.  This is what you have to implement if you are dealing with buggy and undocumented hardware -- as, all too often, you are.  Sometimes you can get some doco for $ and an NDA, but then in order to get the real doco it is much more $$$ and a much tighter NDA, and the existence of that option is not even divulged until after things have already gone very far south.If it were only a matter of reading the top-level doco for this or that chip, there would be no issue.

Alot of embedded stuff is outsourced and doesn't want to waste the computing power for stuff like stack canaries. I recall the following from making a tool for a dlink? router?//Reads a file name
foo ReadFilePath()
{
// Get file name
// TICKET 21321: Fixed crash by increasing buffer size
   char FilePath[100];
   ReadFileName(&FilePath);
}It sticks out to me, since the crash was clearly from a buffer overflow, and they had this documented in the source code that increasing the buffer size fixes it. What they didn't realize was that the bug would still happen and you could get a buffer overflow from this and do whatever you wanted. This is the level of programmer you're dealing with who's writing embedded software in an overseas sweatshop. And the talent isn't even there domestically since they're severely underpaid compared to someone writing simple javascript.

Why? If the rest of the car can function within design specifications for years, why can't the firmware?I'm fine with updates to add compatibility with new protocols and such, but to me a bug implies there's a standing problem with the current system that's not due to some sort of wear/changing standard/component damage etc. While one can point to examples of cars with defective mechanical designs, I don't think anyone considers it impossible to create designs without such defects (where defects are defined wrt. specifications), why is this the view in software engineering?

Now that all vehicles have entertainment systems connected to the internet, I guess it is tempting to use that to reprogram ECUs, I haven't been working in this area recently though.The first use case of connecting entertainment systems to a vehicle bus that I can remember was to read some engine settings and turn up the volume on the radio at higher speeds.

Is anyone actually begging for this though? And why do you need a full bus? This feels like a luxury car problem that could be solved over I2C or something.I'm reading this whole SDV thing, and outside of using less ECUs, it seems like an overengineered solution to what was hardly a problem. If we can update ECUs already with OBD-II, step 1 is just making a virtualized OBD-II port that the infotainment system can talk to. Everything else can then stay unchanged until later.

A "virtualized OBD-II" is really just a UDS server if I understand what you're trying to convey. UDS is a dumpster fire of a protocol that should be expunged from existence, but my personal feelings aside can be run anywhere you want. That exists. I'm not aware of many systems that directly connect the infotainment processors directly to critical CAN buses. Usually there's an intermediary component to isolate them.

Consider this. Almost every car on the road today has an unsecured bus going back to like the 1980s. However you need to actually access the car to do something malicious so the threat vector is zero; since if you have access to the car you can also just cut brakes or put in a pipe bomb.The only reason why this paradigm changes in the EV era is because the insistence on having EVs phone home. Now you can concievably hack all EVs of this model at once and that is now realistic and even attractive to do. But again not a necessity for running a car. Just something that modern software focused companies want to see that leads to a host of expensive security issues that didn't exist before. The car could be airgapped with the dealer network used to flash software updates like they do with most other cars before EV era.

Part of the problem might be poaching high title people from embedded tech companies while not doing anything for developer compensation.

New car is basically a computer on a simple chassis with an equally simple drive train. Software and battery tech is everything.

I'd probably add that the pay scale for software and electrical/mechanical people probably wasn't notably different in the 90s or so. And California rates didn't compensate for CoL in general. Very different.

Whoop has backed down, somewhat, from the controversial upgrade plans around its Whoop 5.0 fitness tracker.

When the company first announced Whoop 5.0 this week, it said members who wanted the new device could either extend their subscriptions by 12 months or pay a one-time upgrade fee of $49 ($79 for the model with EKG sensors).

This seemed inconsistent with Whoop's overall value proposition, where it charges higher subscription prices (ranging $199 to $359 a year) while allowing customers to upgrade their hardware for free. More specifically, it seemed to contradict a statement on the company's website promising users free hardware upgrades if they've been members for at least six months.

After customers began complaining, the company responded with a Reddit post both announcing a more expansive upgrade policy and claiming to clarify its overall approach.

Now, anyone with more than 12 months remaining on their subscription is eligible for a free upgrade to Whoop 5.0 (or a refund if they've already paid the fee). And customers with less than 12 months can extend their subscription to get the upgrade at no additional cost.

While the company said it's making these changes because it “heard your feedback,” it also suggested that its apparent stinginess was tied to its transition from a model focused on monthly or six-month subscription plans to one where it only offers 12- and 24-month subscriptions.

“We also want to acknowledge that a previous blog article incorrectly stated that anyone who had been a member for just 6 months would receive a free upgrade,” the company said. “This was never our policy and should never have been posted.”

There's been a mixed response to these changes on the Whoop subreddit, with one moderator describing it as a “win for the community.” Other posters were more skeptical, with one writing, “You don't publish a policy by accident and keep it up for years. Removing it after backlash doesn't erase the fact [that] it is real.”

There were also a number of complaints from users who said they had 11 months left on their subscriptions, so they just missed the free upgrade cutoff.

This engineering marvel necessitated custom userspace GPU drivers and probably a patched adapter firmware as well.

External GPU (eGPU) support on Apple Silicon Macs and MacBooks has been a persistent pain point for AI/ML developers. Through what some may consider to be black magic, Tiny Corp has managed to get an AMD eGPU working in Tiny Grad over USB3, a standard that inherently lacks PCIe capabilities. As they're using libusb, this functionality extends to Windows, Linux, and even macOS, including devices with Apple Silicon.

Traditionally, GPUs are connected through PCIe slots or the Thunderbolt/USB4 interfaces, which offer PCI Express tunneling support. As such, external GPU solutions rely on the aforementioned interfaces, which limits their support for older systems and laptops. Unlike Intel-based Macs/MacBooks, Apple Silicon based devices do not support external GPUs, mainly due to the lack of driver support and architectural differences. So, despite their efficiency compared to traditional x86-based systems, users have reported challenges in AI workloads, especially when it comes to prompt processing.

Here's the worlds first AMD GPU driven over USB3. From a Mac! Linux and Windows should work too, it's just libusb.Available today in tinygrad master, use an ADT-UT3G to connect the GPU to your USB port. You have no idea of the level of engineering that went into this. pic.twitter.com/V6trNwcGXtMay 9, 2025

Requirements for running an eGPU through a USB3 interface at this time include the use of an ASM2464PD-based adapter and an AMD GPU. For its tests, Tiny Corp used the ADT-UT3G adapter, which uses the same ASM2464PD chip, but out of the box, it only works with Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB 4 interfaces. The team likely employed a custom firmware to enable USB3 mode that works without direct PCIe communication. Technical details are murky, however, the controller appears to be translating PCIe commands to USB packets and vice versa.

The solution is quite hacky, as it bypasses kernel-level GPU drivers, requires specific hardware, and uses USB3, which was not originally intended for GPU communication. It essentially offloads the computation part, referring to kernel executions, from your system to the eGPU. The constraint here is that data transfer speeds are capped at 10 Gbps due to the USB3 standard used, so loading models into the GPU will take much longer than if you were to use a standard PCIe connection.

Since it uses custom user-space drivers to avoid tinkering with the kernel, the feature is limited to AMD's RDNA 3/4 GPUs, although there's a hint of potential RDNA 2 support in the future. USB3 eGPU functionality has been upstreamed to Tiny Grad's master branch, so if you have an AMD GPU and a supported adapter, feel free to try it out. We can expect Tiny Corp to provide a more detailed and technical breakdown once its developers done tidying up the code.

If you could beat Fugaku at the Nico Nico Super Conference you could do what you want with it for a whole day.

The Fugaku supercomputer was again one of the unlikely stars of the recent Nico Nico Super Conference in Japan. In a re-run of last year, Fugaku was the brains behind the ‘Super Keisan Battle' competition, where humans ritually humiliate themselves in a calculation race with a petascale supercomputer. Up for grabs was a free full day to utilize Fugaku however you might want, a ‘Fugaku One-Day Unlimited Ticket.' However, the competition page contains an admission that this is a game “that no one can win” against Fugaku (machine translation).

🎉#ニコニコ超会議202510秒間でどれだけ足し算ができるか?!＼スーパーコンピュータ「#富岳」と対決！けいさんバトル🧮／「富岳」に勝ったら豪華賞品🎟️✨負けても残念賞としてミニチュア「富岳」を1つプレゼント🎁😉#超富岳🗻ブース (HALL4-B48)で挑戦してね🤗https://t.co/Yg3XaXKwEu pic.twitter.com/B7eDQuuu88April 26, 2025

The Fugaku Face Off is pretty simple, and kind of stacks things even more in the supercomputer's favor. According to the instructions we saw, a competition entrant must solve as many numerical additions as possible in 10 seconds. Most seemed to achieve 10 or 11, but Tomooo_108, for example, managed to solve 13 sums in the allotted time. This pales into insignificance vs the supercomputer, though. Fugaku managed to complete 442,010,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 sums during the 10 second battle. That's four sextillion four hundred twenty quintillion one hundred quadrillion calculations.

Competitors mostly found the scale of their defeat against Fugaku quite amusing, in social media comments we have seen. Some joked that if you could beat Fugaku, you wouldn't need to use it for the free day. Others pondered over the cosmic collapse that would occur if a human could move a pen fast enough to record four sextillion sums in 10 seconds. Good news - even if you lost against Fugaku, there were consolation prizes such as a miniature Fugaku to take home (expand the Tweet embedded above to see them).

At the Nico Nico Super Conference, which seems to be dominated by tech entertainment phenomena (e.g. VTubers and Cosplay), the Fugaku Face Off is another fun diversion, but with a serious twist. The supercomputer makers remind entrants that Fugaku, and its brethren, are used for tasks like research on disaster prevention – flood damage simulation, optimal evacuation plans, and so on.

Fugaku, currently ranked sixth place in the TOP500 supercomputer list, delivers 442 PFlop/s of compute. It wields 158,976 nodes (each powered by a Fujitsu A64FX (48+4 core) microprocessor), packs 4.85 PiB RAM, and runs a custom Linux kernel.

The last time we reported on Fugaku, was a story largely about its successor. The collaborative work between RIKEN and Fujitsu should start this year and the goal is to deliver a ZetaFLOPS-scale supercomputer by 2030.

In the annals of the RTX 40 generation, the RTX Titan Ada reigned as the elusive and mysterious Bigfoot of its time. Various sources unearthed prototypes of this GPU, though Nvidia never released this beast for the mainstream. Roman 'Der8auer' Hartung has now managed to secure a prototype of this card, and in a new video, the overclocking expert showcased its capabilities across various games and synthetics, revealing what could have been.

Nvidia's Titan-class GPUs occupied a unique space among enthusiasts, outfitted with the fastest dies and configurations of their respective generation. While being powerhouses for workstations, they also managed to beat their consumer equivalents in gaming as well. The Titan RTX, revealed in 2018, was the last of its kind and these GPUs have since been superseded by Nvidia's 90-class GPUs: RTX 3090, RTX 4090, and RTX 5090.

The prototype carries a massive quad-slot cooler design, shadowing even the RTX 4090 Founders Edition. The card's shroud is stamped with the "Titan" designation. Der8auer defines it as "The biggest GPU I've ever held in my hand." Internally, the PCB has been mounted vertically to the side, as reflected by the I/O ports at the rear. Specifications-wise, we're looking at a fully-enabled AD102 chip with all 144 Streaming Multiprocessors functional, equating to 18,432 CUDA cores, 12.5% more than the RTX 4090. This is complemented by 48GB of G6X memory, achieved by placing 24x 16Gb modules in clamshell mode. We've already seen images of this GPU's PCB previously.

Der8auer says this GPU has a 450W TGP, despite the dual 12V-2x6 design, and that's probably a limitation of the vBIOS used. The driver used dates back to 2023, but the YouTuber didn't provide further details, likely to protect their sources.

In 3DMark Time Spy Extreme, the RTX Titan Ada beats the RTX 4090 by 15% (139.3 vs 121.3), while consuming 14% (443W vs 388W) more power. Meanwhile, the RTX 5090 is 11% faster than the RTX Titan Ada, but consumes 21% more power. Near-linear scaling at this power draw is quite impressive for the Titan Ada. This suggests the GPU still has some performance headroom available and might be able to match the RTX 5090 in some tests if it benefitted from proper vBIOS and driver support.

3DMark Speedway was less impressive, scoring 7% faster than the RTX 4090, with the RTX 5090 ahead by 33%. Remnant 2 at 4K Max sees the Titan Ada pull ahead of the RTX 4090 by 10%, still 14% behind the RTX 5090, but that's still a commendable result. Much of the same story repeats in Cyberpunk 2077. Other games were accompanied by crashes and weird anomalies due to the drivers. In efficiency (FPS per Watt), the Titan Ada beats both the RTX 5090 and the RTX 4090, albeit by a small margin.

Overall, this was an impressive showcase for what could've been the fastest RTX 40 series GPU. Manufacturing costs were likely the primary reason this GPU didn't see the light of day, as there can only be so many perfect AD102 dies (609mm2) with no defects. The RTX Titan Ada was never a practical GPU, considering the workstation-oriented RTX 6000 Ada, which used a partially disabled AD102 chip (142/144 SMs), cost between $7,000 - $10,000. Either the RTX Titan would've been more expensive than this, which is unlikely since the RTX Titan (Turing) launched at $2,500, or it would've hurt Nvidia's workstation GPU sales.

There have always been two major issues with 3D displays: No one wants to wear 3D glasses, and there has never been enough content to take advantage of the technology.

Samsung's new Odyssey 3D monitor (G90XF) wants to solve these problems in one fell swoop. It uses a lenticular lens and eye-tracking cameras to create a convincing 3D effect to bring PC games to life. It costs a hefty $2,000, a steep price considering how good (and affordable) gaming monitors are nowadays, but the Odyssey brings the 3D technology to the PC in a way that feels like the future we've always dreamed of.

You can't capture or see 3D with just a camera, and that's one of the biggest challenges in describing the experience of using the Samsung Odyssey 3D. You do have to see it with your own eyes to believe it. While that can be true of other important monitor technologies, whether it's resolution, refresh rate, or HDR, 3D is something everyone will want to try at least once.

If you've seen a movie in 3D, you get the idea. Your eyes are tricked into thinking the images are moving toward you in three dimensions. Elements in a game, such as a character or even a dialog window, spring off the screen. The system uses the 3D cameras to not only track your head movement, but predict it. That's the secret sauce in providing a wider “sweet spot” for the 3D to stay in effect. The recommended distance is between 27 and 40 inches, which gives you lots of wiggle room to get comfortable. It's possible to sit too close or far away, but I never felt like I had to stay still or compromise my comfort to stay in view.

That's a big step forward from where this technology was just a few years ago, though there are still limitations. You can't have multiple people in front of the monitor at once, and there are both resolution and PC hardware requirements to be aware of. You have to play the game at full-screen in native resolution, and you'll need at least an Nvidia RTX 3070 graphics card. That rules out many lesser-powered PCs, as well as AMD video cards. You also need to have HDR turned off to play games in 3D.

The biggest limitation, though, is game support. A mere 12 titles are supported officially, and they aren't well known. There are a couple of popular games like Palworld and Stray, but they also include several lesser-known kids' games like The Smurfs: Dreams and SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake. Only The First Berserker: Khazan is labeled as a “co-developed” title. Samsung has been light on details as to what this certification indicates, but unlike the other 11, the developer had to be involved in the 3D implementation in some sense. Samsung promises that there will be 11 more of these “co-developed” releases by the end of the year and as many as 50 generally compatible 3D games.

While that's a good on-ramp, Samsung is attempting to catch up with the vast library of compatible titles in Acer's SpatialLabs ecosystem in support of its Predator SpatialLabs View 27 and other 3D display products. Acer has been building that library for years, so there's a large, notable disparity. On the other hand, the quality of what Samsung has achieved, specifically with the experience in The First Berserker: Khazan, is a step ahead of anything I've seen. At the very least, Samsung should be selling this bundled with a free copy of that game, given the highly limited game selection.

The Samsung Odyssey 3D isn't the first of its kind, but it's the one that feels most like a legitimate product. It's a gorgeous monitor, using a silver chassis similar to the ones on other Odyssey monitors I've enjoyed. While it's an experimental concept monitor for gamers, Samsung has done a fantastic job of making it appear like a standard screen. Yes, it has a wide stand and a large top bezel for its eye-tracking cameras, but other than that, you wouldn't assume this is an early-adopter product. That's unlike the aforementioned Acer Predator SpatialLabs View 27, which doesn't look or feel nearly as high-end.

The setup is fairly simple, though it requires a few things to get started. First off, you need the Reality Hub app launcher to actually play games in 3D. It's too bad it requires a separate app, but the software at least will scan your game libraries and display any supported games. Beyond that, you'll need to plug in the attached USB-A cable, along with whatever you're using for the display itself. I hooked it up to a gaming laptop, and it worked fine.

You'll find the ports on the monitor around the back, which offer the bare minimum, including two HDMI ports, DisplayPort, and two USB-A downstream ports. No headphone jack and no USB-C. On the right of the port array, you'll find the power button, which also serves as the controls for the OSD (on-screen display). The menu is fine, though I was annoyed by how many clicks it took to get to brightness or volume controls.

It comes with a pair of 5-watt speakers, which are decent but not anything special. They have “directional sound,” giving sound effects some added immersion. However, in my test period, the audio was clearer and fuller with the 3D spatial speakers of the Acer monitor.

You'll buy this monitor for its 3D capabilities, but in reality, you'll use it in standard 2D far more often. That's why Samsung was smart to ensure it didn't compromise on the quality of the display. While I do hope an OLED is introduced in the future, the Odyssey 3D uses a high-quality 4K IPS panel with a 165-Hz refresh rate to make sure that gaming in 2D is still an enjoyable experience.

Color coverage is solid (100 percent sRGB, 83 percent AdobeRGB), and color accuracy is excellent. I measured it at 0.83 with my colorimeter, comparable to OLED panels. In SDR, this is also a brighter panel than most OLEDs, reaching 487 nits of max brightness. It won't be nearly as impressive in HDR, but as it turns out, 3D games aren't supported in HDR anyway. Suffice to say, it's a solid 4K gaming monitor on its own—if only it weren't for the exorbitant price.

But the point is 3D, and I tried out a number of the compatible games, including Palworld, GTA: San Andreas, Stray, and SpongeBob. Each game I tried utilizes the 3D effect well enough, though you'll run across some cutscenes or in-game situations that don't work well, such as the opening sequence of GTA: San Andreas. You can dial back or pump up the 3D effect with simple keyboard commands. These games run on the Unreal Engine 4 engine, allowing Samsung to approve them without requiring additional developer work. Samsung hasn't announced support for other game engines like Unreal 5 or Unity.

The real showcase of the technology is The First Berserker: Khazan. Samsung worked directly with the developer for the 3D integration, and the result is spectacular. The highly stylized action game shows just how much the 3D effect can add to the immersion of the game. In the opening sequence, the snow doesn't just fall around the character—you're right there in the flurry, soaking up the atmosphere in a way that isn't possible in 2D. It's less about the action of the game suddenly jumping toward you—like you might expect in a 3D movie—and more about being submerged into the world. That's important because in a game that requires your attention in battles, you don't want the 3D elements to distract. After playing for 30 minutes, you'll find yourself getting used to the extra dimension. If you're like me, you won't want to go back.

The 3D technology isn't explicitly exclusive to games. The monitor can also convert 2D images and videos into 3D, which is fun to experiment with. There are several restrictions, such as the requirement to be in full screen and DRM-protected content. That means you won't be watching full movies in 3D anytime soon.

But watching clips of films or trailers on YouTube shows just how promising it could be if Samsung can get around the DRM problem. So long as they are full screen and with only one other person, you can even use it on video calls, which I tried out. It's pretty incredible, emulating something akin to a toned-down version of Google's Project Starline.

The 3D conversion uses AI to create a depth map to predict where the layers of depth should be. As you may have guessed, it's far from a perfect effect. You can see the AI slop fraying on the edges, and the level of depth is nowhere near as lifelike as it is in games. It also soaks up some performance, causing the Razer Blade 16 I was using to kick its loud fans on.

No one should rush out and buy the Samsung Odyssey 3D. It's expensive, and the list of compatible titles is embarrassingly small. At $2,000, you'll pay a lot for the privilege of testing out the tech. With how good gaming monitors are nowadays, you're paying well over $1,000 for the 3D here. Most people should buy an incredible OLED gaming monitor, which costs roughly $800.

I can't help but be excited by it. For me, it was not unlike trying out virtual reality for the first time. 3D is not nearly as immersive, but not requiring a headset or glasses feels like magic. While I'm not sure I'd want to play every game in 3D, there's so much less fatigue, making this a more practical technology over anything wearable. This monitor has made me genuinely excited about the future of 3D displays. While I wait for a future where the entire Windows operating system can be navigated in 3D—both in games and not—the Samsung Odyssey 3D monitor feels like a glimpse into the future.

It won't be the last of this technology, as Samsung tells me. (Samsung hosted WIRED at a media event in Seattle and paid for a portion of our reporter's travel expenses. We received a review unit shortly after.) If you're only marginally interested, you shouldn't have to wait too long before we see some (hopefully) more affordable options on the market.

Apple is famous for its tight control over pricing, especially on new products. If a deal on a brand-new Apple product is what you're looking for, you usually have to look beyond the official Apple Store.

This is why we think it's really exceptional that the iPad 2025 is now discounted at Amazon: You can buy the newest 128GB Wi-Fi iPad for just $299, which is a full $50 off its $349 introduction price. Make sure you grab yours before it runs out of stock, as over 10,000 units have already been sold in the past few days.

The 11th-generation iPad has been introduced in March 2025 and it is a major leap in Apple's affordable tablet line. Powering it is the A16 Bionic chip, it gives this iPad a huge performance and efficiency boost compared to the last generation. The A16 features a 5-core CPU, a 4-core GPU and 16-core Neural Engine, more than enough to handle intensive apps, multitasking and creative workflows. Paired with 6GB of RAM (and 128GB storage), the iPad 11 delivers a smooth user experience whether you're streaming or gaming.

The screen is a standout in itself, and this is why iPads are so popular: an 11-inch Liquid Retina display with a 2360 x 1640 pixel resolution at 264 ppi with sharp images, deep color and excellent viewing angles. True Tone technology adjusts the color temperature of the display to your environment and 500 nits of brightness make the screen readable and clear even in direct sunlight.

For video calling or photography users, the iPad 11 has a 12MP rear camera with autofocus, Smart HDR 4, and 4K video recording and a 12MP front camera with Center Stage to keep you constantly in frame in video calls. Both cameras come with advanced features like cinematic video stabilization and extended dynamic range. You can use this iPad as a productivity and business tool super easily. With up to all-day battery life, you can count on the iPad 11 to get you through work or a vacation.

Apple's reputation for rarely discounting its devices is true, and this Amazon deal is as one of the best opportunities to get the latest iPad at a reduced price.

It's easy to get caught up in the hype of the latest OLED TVs with their stunning visuals and price tags that soar well above $1,000 But for most consumers, you don't require all the frills to get excellent picture quality and smart functionality. There are affordable alternatives that deliver good performance without paying an arm and a leg, and the VIZIO 40″ 1080p Smart TV is one of these.

This model is a proof that it's possible to get a good, feature-rich TV for a fraction of what high-end models cost. Better still, this TV is currently available for just $138 at Amazon, a price that not only is below its normal $169 price but which is also below its Black Friday sale price of $149.

Despite its low cost, the VIZIO Smart TV doesn't skimp on features or performance: It has a 40-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) display so you will get clear, high-definition images and it will be ideal for bedrooms, small living rooms, or even as a secondary gaming or streaming TV. The TV features a Full Array LED backlighting for a uniform illumination and vibrant colors across the entire screen. It is HDR10 and HLG high dynamic range enabled which releases more detail in light and dark imagery and makes your movies, TV programs, and games look more real.

Driven by Vizio's pretty good SmartCast platform, it gives instant access to all the major streaming apps, including Netflix, Disney+, YouTube, Prime Video and Apple TV+. Navigation is responsive and fluid thanks to the recent software updates that have optimized performance and simplicity. With built-in Chromecast and Apple AirPlay 2, you can project content directly from your phone, tablet, or laptop, making sharing photos, videos, or even screen mirroring a snap. The TV is also Alexa and Google Assistant voice remote control compatible.

Gamers will appreciate the V-Gaming Engine which enhances contrast and color for better gaming and keeps input lag under 10ms at 1080p/60Hz. Two HDMI 1.4 inputs are included to connect consoles or streaming devices, a USB input for media playback, and digital audio output to connect soundbars or home theater systems.

If you're looking for a solid, high-feature smart TV at a price that's hard to beat, this VIZIO model is one of the best deals you'll get on Amazon.

Moderna's mRNA-based flu and covid-19 vaccine could provide the best of both worlds—if it's actually ever approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

This week, scientists at Moderna published data from a Phase III trial testing the company's combination vaccine, codenamed mRNA-1083. Individuals given mRNA-1083 appeared to generate the same or even greater immune response compared to those given separate vaccines, the researchers found. But the FDA's recent policy change on vaccine approvals, orchestrated by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, could imperil the development of this and other future vaccines.

RFK Jr. Spews Even More Nonsense on Autism, Covid in Latest Interview

The trial involved 8,000 people split into two age groups: those between the ages of 50 and 64, and those over 65. People were randomly given mRNA-1083 (plus a placebo) or two already approved flu and covid-19 vaccines.

The vaccine seemed effective across both age groups, with mRNA-1083 participants showing at least the same level of humoral immune response (antibody-based) to circulating flu and covid-19 strains as participants who were given the separate vaccines. On average, this response was actually higher to the flu strains in particular among those given mRNA-1083. The experimental vaccine also appeared to be safe and well-tolerated, as the authors explained in their paper, published Wednesday in JAMA.

The study results are certainly encouraging, and typically they would pave the way toward a surefire FDA approval. But the political situation has changed for the worse. The Department of Health and Human Services recently mandated an overhaul of the vaccine approval process, one that will require all new vaccines to undergo placebo-controlled trials to receive approval.

While many experimental vaccines today are placebo-tested (including the original covid-19 vaccines), it's unclear whether this order will also apply to vaccines that can be compared to existing vaccines, like the combination mRNA-1083 vaccine, or to vaccines that have to be regularly updated to match fast-evolving viruses like the flu and covid-19.

Some vaccine experts have said that these changes are unnecessary and potentially unethical, since it could leave some people vulnerable to an infection that already has a vaccine. The new rule also might delay the availability of upcoming seasonal vaccines, particularly the current covid-19 shots.

RFK Jr. Goes Full Tinfoil, Pledges to Stop Chemtrails in Latest Dr. Phil Interview

A potentially important wrinkle for the mRNA-1083 vaccine is that no mRNA-based vaccine for the flu is currently approved. That reality could very well be all that the FDA needs to demand further placebo-controlled trials. RFK Jr. and other recent Trump appointees have also been highly skeptical of mRNA-based vaccines in general, despite no strong evidence that these vaccines are significantly less safe than other types. Kennedy, who has a long history of supporting the anti-vaccination movement, has even wrongly declared that the mRNA covid-19 vaccine was the “deadliest vaccine ever made.”

Moderna stated last week it doesn't expect its mRNA-1083 vaccine to be approved before 2026, following the FDA's request for late-stage data showing the vaccine's effectiveness against flu specifically. But it's worth wondering if even that timeline is now in jeopardy under the current public health regime.

Jiushark's JF800 Diamond is the strongest performing air cooler we've ever tested, but it's not easy to get in the U.S.

Strongest air cooler we've tested

Chart-topping noise-normalized performance

Nice aesthetics

You'll probably have to import this one via AliExpress

Runs louder than competing coolers


Why you can trust Tom's Hardware




Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.


While Jiushark isn't well known in U.S. enthusiast and PC building circles, we've covered the company in the past, highlighting some of its unique products like the Jiushark M.2 Three, an M.2 SSD cooler that uses a dual heatpipe radiator and fan, much like a mini CPU cooler. We've also tested the JF13K Diamond low-profile CPU cooler.

Today, we're looking at the new Jiushark JF800 Diamond dual-tower air cooler, available in white and black, with the company claiming cooling capabilities of up to 280W!



Will Jiushark's latest make our list of best CPU coolers on the market? There's no question that it deserves a shot because, spoiler, this is the strongest performing dual-tower cooler we've ever tested, on both Intel Raptor Lake and Arrow Lake CPUs. But it's also pretty hard to come by in the U.S., unless you're willing to order it directly from China.

Let's take a look at the specifications and features of the cooler. Then we'll go over thermal performance and noise levels.

Opening the compact box reveals the accessories, neatly packaged above the cooler.



Included in the box are the following:



*️⃣ Six copper heatpipes

The Jiushark JF800 Diamond moves heat away from the CPU using six copper heatpipes – but as you'll see in our benchmarks, it offers performance superior to similar air coolers we've tested.



*️⃣ Heatsink Design

The towers of the JF800 feature what appears to be a fairly basic fin design.



The tops of the heatsinks have a grille reminiscent of cattle guards, adding some nice aesthetics with the ARGB lighting shining through them.



*️⃣ Two 120mm fans with ARGB lighting

There's more to a cooler than just the heatsink or radiator. The bundled fans significantly impact cooling and noise levels, as well as how the cooler looks in your case. The included fans here have nine blades, and there are models with or without ARGB lighting, according to your preference.



As you'll see in the benchmarks below, the fans help enable superior thermal performance, but can be a little noisy.

There are many factors other than the CPU cooler that can influence your cooling performance, including the case you use and the fans installed in it. A system's motherboard can also influence this, especially if it suffers from bending, which results in poor cooler contact with the CPU.

To prevent bending from impacting our cooling results, we've installed Thermalright's LGA 1700 contact frame into our testing rig. If your motherboard is affected by bending, your thermal results will be worse than those shown below.

Not all motherboards are affected equally by this issue. I tested Raptor Lake CPUs on two motherboards. And while one showed significant thermal improvements after installing Thermalright's LGA1700 contact frame, the other motherboard showed no temperature diffrence! Check out our review of the contact frame for more information.

I've also tested this cooler with Intel's latest platform, Arrow Lake and the LGA 1851 socket.

CPU

Intel Core Ultra 9 285K

GPU

MSI Ventus 3X RTX 4070Ti Super

Motherboard

MSI Z890 Carbon Wifi

Case

MSI MPG Gungnir 300R

System fans

Pre-installed case fans

The installation of this air cooler is easy with the included mounting hardware.

1. You'll first need to place the backplate against the rear of the motherboard after assembling it.



2. Next, you'll need to take the rubber standoffs and slide them against the poles of the backplate.



3. Then, you'll take the mounting bars and place them on top of the rubber standoffs, securing them with the included screws.



4. Apply the included thermal paste to your CPU. If you have any questions on how to do this properly, please refer to our handy how to apply thermal paste guide.

5. Remove the middle fan from the cooler, then place the cooler on top of your CPU. Use a screwdriver to secure it using the screws in between the two towers, shown below.



6. Once complete, connect the PWM and ARGB cables to the corresponding motherboard headers. Installation is now complete.

If you've been waiting for the “perfect” moment to upgrade your home lighting, now is the time: Govee's Smart RGBIC Floor Lamp is currently at its lowest price ever on Amazon. It just dropped to $64 which is a massive 35% savings from its usual $99. This is a very rare opportunity, as Govee (which is the undisputed reference in smart lighting) seldom offers discounts outside of major events like Prime Day or Black Friday.

See at Amazon

The RGBIC Floor Lamp is a great example of why Govee is so popular: Despite its high-tech credentials, this lamp is very simple to use. The setup is quite straightforward: you just have to assemble the lamp, plug it in, and connect it to your Wi-Fi. From there, you can control everything using voice commands through Alexa or Google Assistant or with the intuitive Govee Home app. Switching colors, brightness, or switching between dynamic scenes takes seconds, making it simple even for smart home beginners.

What is unique about this lamp is the way it succeeds in changing the mood of any room without ever appearing kitsch or out of context: The low-profile, matte black, premium and minimalist design blends in with contemporary decor. It is not a gadget but a proper decorative item that adds to the beauty of your living room, bedroom or gaming room. The lamp's 1000-lumen output is bright enough for daily use, and its RGBIC technology (which you can customize) allows it to display multiple colors at once for effects that are absolutely unique.

With 16 million color support and 58 pre-set scene modes, you can tailor the ambiance to suit any mood or occasion.

A new model of tiny human ovary organoids, or ovaroids, has been developed from stem cells, according to research presented at the first Joint Congress between the European Society of Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) and the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE). This achievement may help to understand and develop treatments for conditions in which these organs do not develop or function properly, including differences in sex development and infertility.

During human embryo development, sex determination occurs at a very early stage, making the process difficult to study and understand. Typically, gonads begin to form at about four weeks, and the decision to become testes or ovaries happens at about six weeks. Sometimes, however, there is a mismatch between an individual's sex chromosomes and gonadal or anatomical sex - a group of rare conditions known as differences in sex development (DSDs). 

While these conditions are rare - about 1 in 4,500 - milder forms occur in about 1 in 200 people. DSDs are often detected prenatally or in infancy, though some do not become evident until puberty or later. In the past 15 years, a growing number of genes have been implicated in atypical gonad development, but approximately 50% of children with DSDs due to atypical gonad formation still lack a definitive genetic diagnosis. 

To understand gonad development and disease, researchers from the Institut Pasteur in Paris differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into granulosa-like cells - an ovarian somatic cell type which helps eggs grow and mature - and primordial germ cell-like cells. Next, they combined the two cell populations to form the human ovaroids that replicate key structural and functional aspects of ovarian follicles. 

While other ovaroid models exist, this is the first time for granulosa-like cells and primordial germ cell-like cells to be generated together, without introducing exogenous transcription factors, to produce organoids.

Transcription factors are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences and turn nearby genes on or off, so using external ones can override the innate genetic programme of the cells, which makes the derived populations unsuitable for disease modelling."

Dr. Anu Bashamboo, senior author 

Previously, researchers from the Institut Pasteur, along with collaborators from the Francis Crick Institute, developed somatic cells of the testes - specifically Sertoli cells which are commonly affected in DSDs - from hiPSCs. The team grew somatic gonadal cells with male chromosomes (XY), carrying a genetic variant of a specific gene associated with atypical testis development. As a result, these cells were unable to form three-dimensional tubular structures that resemble the testis cords, leading to a dysgenetic gonad that mimics DSDs.

"By creating human-specific, lab-grown models of both testicular and ovarian development using induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), the research overcomes key limitations in the field -particularly the lack of suitable animal models due to poor conservation of developmental genes and mechanisms across species - and provides a powerful platform for studying gene function in a controlled environment,' said Dr. Bashamboo.

"Our work more broadly contributes a scalable, human-relevant model system to developmental biology, reproductive medicine and genetic diagnostics. It bridges the gap between basic science and clinical application, offering tools that could improve diagnostic yields and support the development of targeted treatments for individuals with DSDs and related reproductive disorders, including infertility and certain types of ovarian tumours" said Dr. Bashamboo.

Dr. Bashamboo added: "Our model also opens up new possibilities for screening drugs and environmental toxins affecting human gonads, personalized medicine and future therapeutic interventions."

Sumeet Chugh, MD, whose research into sudden cardiac arrest has led to novel methods of predicting the usually fatal condition, has been promoted to vice dean and chief artificial intelligence health research officer at Cedars-Sinai.

Chugh was also honored recently with the Heart Rhythm Society's 2025 Distinguished Scientist Award for clinical science. The award was presented April 26 during Heart Rhythm 2025 in San Diego. 

This award recognizes Dr. Chugh's dedication to understanding sudden cardiac arrest and preventing this deadly emergency."

Eduardo Marbán, MD, PhD, executive director of the Smidt Heart Institute, Cedars-Sinai

The Distinguished Scientist Award is given to an investigator who has made a lasting impact on patient care and the field of heart rhythm research. Chugh has dedicated his career to improving prediction and prevention of sudden cardiac arrest, a heart rhythm disorder that causes the heart to stop and often leads to instant death. He has published more than 275 scientific papers.

"I'm grateful to the Heart Rhythm Society for this recognition of our work and accept it on behalf of my colleagues and mentees at Cedars-Sinai," said Chugh, the Pauline and Harold Price Chair in Cardiac Electrophysiology Research. "Our team is motivated to make a real impact on this deadly condition."

According to the American Heart Association, more than 356,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occur each year in the U.S. Nearly 90% of them are fatal.

Chugh's team discovered a new method for identifying the best candidates for the implantable defibrillator, a lifesaving intervention. They also combined data from emergency responders, medical records and biological samples to predict imminent sudden cardiac arrest within hours to days of warning symptoms. Their work has improved identification of people at risk and led to the term "near-term prevention" of sudden cardiac arrest.

Chugh is also a leader in artificial intelligence research, which he has harnessed to improve prediction of sudden cardiac arrest.

In his new role as vice dean and chief artificial intelligence health research officer, Chugh will oversee the translation of AI research into clinical trials and patient care. He will lead the new Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Research Center (AIMRC), which will help departments and institutes incorporate AI into their research.

"Dr. Chugh is a foremost investigator in both heart rhythm and AI research," said Jeffrey Golden, MD, executive vice dean for Research and Education at Cedars-Sinai. "His use of AI to assess the risk for sudden cardiac arrest has the potential to advance the field and save lives. We are eager for him to broaden his AI research experience to all areas of clinical care at Cedars-Sinai."

In 2024, Chugh received the Distinguished Scientist Award for clinical science from the American College of Cardiology. He is a member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation and the Association of American Physicians, and is past president of the Association of University Cardiologists and the Cardiac Electrophysiology Society.

How tall your child will be may be decided in the first two years, but it won't tell you when puberty starts. This study sheds light on the lifelong significance of early growth and the limits of its predictive power.

Study: Early life growth is related to pubertal growth and adult height – a QEPS-model analysis​​​​​​​. Image Credit: Monkey Business Images / Shutterstock

Growth patterns during the first two years of a child's life may shape pubertal growth and adult height, but have little effect on pubertal timing, according to research presented at the first Joint Congress between the European Society of Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) and the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE). The findings highlight the importance of early-life growth, which could be used as a marker to predict future growth, development, and health. The results of this study have also been published in the journal Pediatric Research.

It is well established that the early-life growth period - from conception to approximately two years - is crucial in determining long-term health outcomes later in life. However, previous research has mainly focused on weight due to its widespread data availability, and the differences in pubertal growth, pubertal timing, and adult height between individuals have not yet been explained by early growth. In this study, researchers from Sweden analysed data on the height measurements, birth characteristics, and parental heights of 4,700 individuals with Nordic ethnicity, born in 1974 and 1990, from the GrowUp Gothenburg cohorts.

Using the Quadratic-Exponential-Pubertal-Stop (QEPS) model to assess growth patterns, the researchers found that early-life growth accounted for about 38% of the variation in pubertal growth, but the height changes during puberty explained only about 9% of the variation in adult height. About 67% of the difference in adult height between individuals was determined by early life, about 67% was by childhood growth, whereas about 60% was attributed to birth size and 37% to the average height of both parents.

"Surprisingly, the timing of puberty was not significantly influenced by early-life growth which suggests that, while early-life growth plays a significant role in growth during puberty and in determining final adult height, other factors such as genetics and the environment may be stronger determinants of pubertal timing," said first author Dr Carin Skogastierna from the University of Gothenburg and Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Sweden.

Previous studies have also shown similar associations between early-life growth and adult height. However, these associations have never been studied using the QEPS growth model - a model that allowed the researchers to examine specific growth stages separately. "With the QEPS growth model, we were able to study specific early growth and specific pubertal growth, separately from the ongoing 'basic' growth for the first time," said Dr Skogastierna.

Dr Skogastierna said, "We are continuing to work to understand how early-life growth relates to well-being, health, and socio-economic status later in life and how this information may be used alongside efforts to support early-life monitoring and healthy lifestyle changes to prevent disease."

"It is important to note that if poor early growth is associated with reduced wellbeing in adolescents and a higher risk of disease and death in adulthood, such findings could further emphasise that healthcare aimed at young children is a good socio-economic investment for society," she added.

A large study of nearly a million adolescent boys reveals that late puberty isn't as harmless as once thought, linking it to a sharply higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes in early adulthood.

Boys who enter puberty later than average are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes as adults, irrespective of their weight or socio-economic factors, according to research presented at the first Joint Congress between the European Society of Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) and the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE). The findings may uncover a potential new risk factor for boys developing type 2 diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes that results from the body's inability to make enough insulin or properly use insulin. Over 90% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes, which is driven by socio-economic, demographic, environmental, and genetic factors. Type 2 diabetes - once called adult-onset diabetes - most often develops in people 45 or older, but more and more children, teens, and young adults are now being diagnosed too, and researchers are investigating the various risk factors.

In this study, researchers from Israel examined 964,108 Israeli adolescent boys aged 16–19 years old who were recruited for military service between 1992 and 2015, of whom 4,307 were diagnosed with delayed puberty. They followed the individuals until the end of 2019. They found that adolescent boys with delayed puberty were about 2.5 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes in early adulthood than boys without delayed puberty, even after adjusting for birth year and country, socio-economic status, cognitive function, and education level. After accounting for body weight, the risk for type 2 diabetes was 37% higher in these boys. In addition, the researchers found that, among teens with delayed puberty, about 140 per 100,000 developed type 2 diabetes each year, whereas only about 41 per 100,000 teens without delayed puberty developed the disease every year.

"To our knowledge, our large-scale study is the first to report an association between delayed puberty in adolescent boys and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes," said lead author Professor Orit Pinhas-Hamiel from Sheba Medical Center. 

She added: "One study suggests a protective association between delayed puberty and type 2 diabetes risk, but it had a low response rate (5.5%) and relied on recall-based anthropometric and pubertal timing data, using voice breaking as a surrogate marker for puberty."

"Our results are surprising as delayed puberty is generally considered a benign condition," said Professor Pinhas-Hamiel. "We think the higher risk of early type 2 diabetes in boys with delayed puberty may be due to a window of opportunity during development when the body is especially sensitive to hormones and environmental factors - similar to how early childhood shapes language skills or how puberty affects bone strength."

"Our findings contribute to a better understanding of how pubertal timing may influence long-term metabolic health and highlight the need for medical follow-up to enable early diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Recognising delayed puberty in males as an early-life marker for increased risk of type 2 diabetes may help identify vulnerable individuals, allowing for targeted prevention strategies," said Professor Pinhas-Hamiel.

Researchers from Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, the Maccabi Healthcare Services, the Israel Defense Forces Medical Corps, the Gertner Institute for Epidemiology and Health Policy Research, and the Israel Center for Disease Control carried out the study. The data on the delayed puberty diagnoses were collected from the Israel Defense Forces Medical Corps, while the diabetes data were retrieved from the Israeli National Diabetes Registry.

Every day, chemicals in toys, soaps, and packaging may be silently reshaping children's reproductive development. Italian researchers link phthalate exposure to measurable changes in genital growth by age three.

Three-year-old boys are more likely to have a shorter anogenital distance when their mothers have high levels of phthalates in their urine, according to research presented at the first Joint Congress between the European Society of Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) and the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE). In girls, the direct exposure to phthalates was associated with a shorter anogenital distance. The findings highlight how exposure to environmental pollutants can cause alterations in genital measurements during the first three years of life, which may affect sexual development and fertility later in life.

Phthalates are a large group of man-made chemicals widely used in everyday consumer products, such as household cleaners, food packaging, toys, cosmetics, and personal care products. These endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can interfere with our body's natural hormones and could have harmful health effects, including sexual development in children. For example, boys who are exposed to phthalates prenatally have been shown to develop genital defects, which could lead to infertility. Anogenital distance - the distance between the anus and genitals - is used as a marker of reproductive health related to hormone levels, lower semen quality, fertility and reproductive disorders. 

In this study, researchers from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia in Italy collected urine samples and anogenital distances from 188 children at birth, 3 months, 6 months, and 3 years, and from their 188 mothers, after giving birth and when their children turned 3 years old. They analysed these samples for eight major phthalate metabolites and found that all of them were detectable in every sample in mothers and children, progressively increasing as time passed. In fact, most children and their mothers exceeded the newer and more conservative risk threshold for phthalate exposure.

In addition, the researchers found that maternal phthalate exposure impacted only boys, and 3-year-old boys had a shorter anogenital distance. In contrast, the anogenital distances of 3-year-old girls were affected by their own exposure to phthalates, and the higher the exposure, the shorter the measurements were.

"We were surprised to find such high exposure for those phthalates which are currently less restricted. Bearing in mind that the cut-off levels for the anti-androgenic effect are dropping considerably, being exposed to these substances daily may indeed represent a major health risk for the younger generation in the long term," said Dr Laura Lucaccioni, lead author of the study. "Preventive public health measures to protect vulnerable groups are needed."

Dr Lucaccioni added: "The eight phthalate metabolites studied in our work can be found in a wide range of everyday products, including toys, make-up products and soaps, among others. The key priority is to check the origin of our daily-use products and implement straightforward protocols to minimise exposure."

"Our findings in boys suggest that both prenatal and family environmental exposure may significantly impact their sexual development. For girls, exposure to phthalates may play a role in other hormonal mechanisms. However, our study's sample size is small so we cannot firmly state that there are indeed differences between boys and girls, but we do establish that both may be affected by these endocrine disruptors," said Dr Lucaccioni.

The researchers plan to continue monitoring the population in their study and assess phthalate exposure and anogenital distances at pre-school age and around puberty. "By continuing to monitor the population over time, we expect to identify the endocrine effects of prolonged exposure to phthalates, such as puberty disorders," said Dr Lucaccioni.

Girls given antibiotics as newborns are more likely to hit puberty early, especially with multiple types of antibiotics. This large-scale study raises red flags about overuse of antibiotics in infancy and its long-term effects on hormonal development.

Girls given antibiotics during their first year of life, especially in the first three months, are more likely to enter puberty at an earlier age, according to research presented at the first Joint Congress between the European Society of Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) and the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE). The likelihood of early puberty was also higher among those exposed to a greater variety of antibiotic classes. The findings highlight the importance of appropriately using these medicines in infants and how early-life drug exposure could shape future health outcomes.

Early puberty, also known as central precocious puberty (CPP), is a condition characterised by the early onset of secondary sexual development in children. In girls, this means before age eight and, in boys, before age 9. Early puberty mainly affects girls and often has no apparent cause, while it is less common in boys. Over the past few decades, early puberty has been on the rise, and researchers are continuously investigating the potential contributing factors.

In this study, researchers from Hanyang University Guri Hospital and Hanyang University Medical Center analysed data on the antibiotic intake of 322,731 children, aged 0–12 months, in South Korea. They followed these children until the girls turned 9 years old and the boys were 10, and found that girls who were prescribed antibiotics before 3 months of age were 33% more likely to start puberty early. The risk was 40% higher in girls who received antibiotics before 14 days of age, and overall, the earlier the antibiotic exposure, the greater the risk of early puberty. Additionally, girls who used five or more classes of antibiotics had a 22% increased risk of early puberty compared to those who used two or fewer classes. No association was found between antibiotic intake and early puberty in boys. 

"This population-based study is one of the first to explore this association between early-life antibiotic use, including the timing, frequency and number of classes, and in such a large national cohort of children," said Dr Yunsoo Choe at Hanyang University Guri Hospital in South Korea, who was involved in the study.

Dr Choe added, "In our earlier research, we found that exclusive breastfeeding was associated with a lower risk of central precocious puberty (CPP), supporting the idea that early-life factors affecting the gut microbiome or endocrine-metabolic pathways may influence pubertal development. The current study builds on this by examining antibiotic exposure as a possible modifier of pubertal timing, using a much larger population and more detailed exposure data."

"Our results may encourage doctors and parents to consider the long-term effects of antibiotics when making treatment decisions for young children," said Dr Choe.

Next, the researchers will explore how early antibiotic use may affect pubertal development and whether repeated or long-term intake during childhood is associated with other aspects of growth, metabolism, or endocrine health. "Our study adds to growing concerns about how antibiotics given in infancy could affect children's long-term development - possibly by altering the gut microbiome or hormonal balance - but the reasons behind it are still unclear," said Dr Choe. 

"Understanding these biological mechanisms may help guide safer antibiotic use and inform early-life care strategies for children," she concluded.

A major Australian study finds that a child's long-term weight is closely tied to their parents' BMI before birth, especially the mother's, underscoring the urgent need to tackle obesity before pregnancy to break the cycle across generations.

New research being presented at this year's European Congress on Obesity (ECO 2025) highlights the need to support women and their families with overweight or obesity to optimise their health and weight before they become pregnant.

The Australian study found that the greater a woman's BMI in pregnancy, the greater her child's weight from birth to age ten. This was the case regardless of whether the woman took part in a dietary and lifestyle intervention (LI) while pregnant or received standard antenatal care (SC). They also reported that the BMI of the father significantly influences the child's weight at age 10.

The results are the latest from the LIMIT trial, which involved 2121 pregnant women with overweight or obesity (average age 29.4 years, median BMI 31.1 in early pregnancy).

Half of the women took part in the LI, which consisted of advice and support for eating a healthy diet (for example, eating more fruit and fibre and reducing intake of refined carbohydrates and saturated fat) and increasing physical activity. The other participants received standard antenatal care (standard care group, SC).

"Women with overweight or obesity are at increased risk of pregnancy complications, like gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, caesarean birth and high infant birth weight, and for their children to develop obesity," says researcher Professor Jodie Dodd, of the University of Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.

"With approximately 50% of women entering pregnancy with overweight or obesity, the trial was carried out to see if changes in diet and physical activity during pregnancy could reduce these risks."

The initial results1, published in 2014, showed that infants whose mothers participated in the LI group were 18% less likely to have birth weights above 4kg (8lb 13oz), a known risk for childhood obesity. However, the two groups had no other differences in maternal or birth outcomes, including pregnancy complications. 

The children were also followed throughout childhood. There was no evidence of a difference in the health or growth of the children from women in either the LI or SC group.

For the latest study, Professor Dodd and colleagues examined the effect of maternal BMI in early pregnancy on childhood weight and other measures of growth taken at birth and aged 6 months, 18 months, 3-5 years old, and 8-10 years old.

They found that a child's growth was linked to its mother's BMI in early pregnancy – and that every 5kg/m2 increase in a woman's BMI was associated with an increase in their child's BMI by 0.11kg/m2 at birth, to 0.74kg/m2 at 8-10 years of age.

The effect of maternal BMI became more prominent at age 3-5 and was particularly noticeable at 8-10. This was the case across the different measures of child growth studied—BMI, weight, and their standardised measures. Additionally, paternal BMI impacted child weight and BMI, particularly at ages 8-10.

Professor Dodd says: "We know that women living with overweight or obesity are at increased risk of complications like high blood pressure in pregnancy. We also know that lifestyle interventions during pregnancy are ineffective for improving health outcomes for women and their baby/child.(1, 2, 3)

"What we found here was that a woman's BMI in early pregnancy impacts how her child grows from birth to 8-10 years of age –so, if a woman's BMI is higher going into pregnancy, her child's risk of overweight and obesity increases too. Fathers also have a role to play, as paternal BMI also contributes to child obesity.

"It's vital that healthcare providers focus on supporting women and their families to optimise their health and weight before pregnancy, if we are to intervene and potentially reduce the intergenerational cycle of obesity."

Could a simple mineral hold the key to solving unexplained male infertility? New findings suggest that phosphate, vital for energy and testicular function, may play a surprising role in sperm health, offering a new angle for treatment.

Men with fertility issues have lower levels of phosphate in the blood than average, according to research presented at the first Joint Congress between the European Society of Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) and the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE). In addition, low phosphate concentrations in the blood were associated with reduced sperm motility in infertile men. The findings can help researchers improve the understanding of the biological factors involved in male reproductive health, which could lead to new fertility treatments.

Over the past 50 years, sperm counts worldwide have halved, sperm quality has declined alarmingly, and 15% of all heterosexual couples are facing infertility. Male infertility contributes to approximately half of all cases of infertility, but for the majority of men with fertility issues, the cause remains unexplained. However, many factors - genetics, lifestyle, nutritional choices, and hormonal imbalances - can affect men's fertility. For example, in recent years, vitamin D deficiency has been linked with poor semen quality.

In this study, researchers from the Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev and the Copenhagen University Rigshospitalet analysed blood and semen samples from 1,242 men with infertility in Denmark. They found that 36% of these men had clinically low levels of phosphate in their blood, as opposed to the approximate 2–4% incidence seen in the general population in Denmark. Men with moderately low phosphate levels had fewer motile and progressively motile sperm compared to those with normal phosphate levels. In addition, the men with moderately low phosphate levels had slightly higher levels of the hormone estradiol. Low levels of phosphate were not associated with sperm count. 

"Surprisingly, we identified, for the first time, that the percentage of infertile men with low phosphate concentration in the blood is higher than that of the general Danish population," said lead author Dr Sam Kafai Yahyavi.

Dr Kafai Yahyavi added, "This could mean that phosphate—a mineral with known effects on energy production and bone strength—has the potential to be targeted directly to improve fertility, possibly by treating some of the infertile men with phosphate supplements."

"While our study does not prove that low phosphate concentrations cause infertility, it highlights a potential connection that could be important for understanding and treating male infertility," said Dr Kafai Yahyavi.

The team has also previously found that phosphate is essential for testicular function in healthy men, as phosphate concentrations in the seminal fluid are more than 20-fold higher than in the blood, implying phosphate is regulated within the male reproductive system. With this in mind, in another study, also presented at the Joint Congress of ESPE and ESE, Dr Kafai Yahyavi and colleagues investigated this phosphate transport mechanism in rodents and humans and found that high phosphate levels in human semen were associated with higher-quality sperm and increased testosterone levels.

"Our study suggests that phosphate levels in the reproductive organs may be important for organ function and sperm function, and we are now searching for regulators of this transport and through them, the influence on male fertility," said first author Ms Zhihui Cui, a PhD student at the Copenhagen University Herlev Hospital. 

Dr Kafai Yahyavi said, "This is exciting because this transport mechanism now raises the question of whether manipulating phosphate concentrations in the blood will affect fertility. Therefore, our next step of research is to start controlled trials, in which phosphate is used as an intervention, in order to assess the direct effect of phosphate on fertility in men - but also in women."

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is fast approaching, with participating teams ramping up preparations ahead of the tournament's June 14 kickoff. But things have taken an unfortunate turn for Sergio Ramos, as the Spanish defender has suffered a major setback at Monterrey just one month before the competition begins.

Monterrey faced Toluca on Saturday in the second leg of the Liga MX quarterfinals, having won the first leg 3–2. Playing without Ramos—who was sidelined with a muscle strain—Rayados lost 2–1, resulting in a 4–4 aggregate score. Toluca advanced on away goals, eliminating Monterrey in a crushing blow that triggered swift repercussions within the club.

Following the loss, Monterrey's front office decided to part ways with head coach Martin Demichelis. The decision was made by sporting director Antonio Noriega, who cited a string of disappointing results and internal conflict between the coaching staff and players.

Demichelis had a promising start with the club, leading the team to the Liga MX final in December 2024. However, things began to unravel in 2025. A premature exit from the CONCACAF Champions Cup, a reported rift with midfielder Sergio Canales, and now a quarterfinal defeat to Toluca proved to be too much. When asked about his future following the loss, the Argentine coach responded:

“I believe we all deserve a second chance, so I'm proud of the institution I'm part of. I'll always have the strength to keep going—there are things in life that are extremely difficult. This is very painful for the fans and for the club. We had much higher aspirations, the club deserves much more, and so does the squad. I will continue with the same strength and integrity that define me, but of course, there are things that don't depend on me,” he said during the post-match press conference.

Demichelis joined the Mexican side in August 2024 after a stint with River Plate. He departs after just two tournaments and one full season in charge, having led the team in 43 matches with a record of 20 wins, 11 draws, and 12 losses.

While Demichelis faced criticism over the team's recent performances, he was the first and only coach Ramos has worked under since joining Monterrey. His dismissal now leaves the club racing against time to find a suitable replacement ahead of the Club World Cup.

Monterrey will compete in Group E of the tournament alongside Inter Milan, River Plate, and Urawa Red Diamonds. Ramos and his team will open against the Italian side on June 17, face River Plate on June 21, and close the group stage against the Japanese club on June 25. The minimum expectation: advance past the group stage.

The Club World Cup is quickly approaching the shores of the United States as it hosts the tournament in its first-ever competition. Like anything in FIFA, it hasn't gone without controversy.

The MLS already has two teams set and ready to compete in the Inter Miami and Seattle Sounders tournament.

There is a chance for MLS to have one more spot in the tournament due to an open spot, LAFC was awarded with being selected for a play-in game with that open spot on the line.

Club Leon from Mexico was removed from the competition after being set to play Chelsea when the teams were originally announced.

Club Leon was informed by FIFA that they were no longer permitted to compete due to breaking ownership rules. This states that an owner or ownership group cannot own more than one team.

Liga MX still has two teams in the competition in Pachuca and Monterrey, in groups H and E, respectively.

LAFC was rewarded with a spot as the MLS representative in the qualifier due to being the runner-up in the 2023 Champions Cup. Club America, which is the Mexican side in the qualifier, was chosen due to being the top-ranked team in Concacaf without a bid in the World Cup.

LAFC fans are thrilled to have a chance to compete, while fans across the MLS are upset that other teams were not considered.

A few teams across the MLS thought they should have been selected for this qualifying match due to recent success. The Columbus Crew has been one of the best Clubs in the MLS since Nancy took over as manager of the Crew.

A 2023 MLS Cup victory and a strong season last year had many in the Crew fan base hoping they would be selected for their domestic league success.

Despite the poor start, the LA Galaxy are the reigning champions from last season. Many would have made a case for the Galaxy before the season started, considering the Galaxy has been winless a few months into the season, it is safe to say that fans are no longer backing this idea.

The Vancouver Whitecaps rise to the top of the standings and league-wide respect due to their top form and run the Concacaf Champions Cup. Despite the Whitecaps being a top team in the West and the Champions Cup final, they don't have a real case due to the timing of their success not aligning with the selection process.

Before we talk about hypotheticals, we need to mention that LAFC won't know if they compete in the end of the month when they play Club America. That game will take place on May 31st in LA.

If LAFC can defeat Club America, they will be inserted in group D, which could be a favorable group for the club. Seattle has the toughest group, while Inter Miami has no top European clubs in its group.

The biggest team in group D is Chelsea, the Premier League club will be the favorite to win the group. The other two teams consist of Es Tunis of Turkey and Flamengo in Brazil, despite not being in a top-flight league, both teams have high quality.

There is a chance that if LAFC qualifies, they may not score a single point. With the rise of the MLS quality in play there are many fans and critics out there that believe they can contend in their group and make it to the knockout rounds.

The Catalans' electrifying wide men put Los Blancos to the sword on Sunday as they came out on top in a seven-goal thriller

A Raphinha and Lamine Yamal masterclass put Barcelona on the brink of another La Liga triumph after a remarkable 4-3 comeback win over Real Madrid on Sunday.

The fourth and final Clasico of the season started with a bang when Kylian Mbappe was brought down in the box by goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, and the French forward dispatched the subsequent spot-kick in the fifth minute. Things then went from bad to worse for Barca when Mbappe was on hand to finish off a rapid-fire counter-attack to make it 2-0 just nine minutes later.

Madrid were indebted to their own 'keeper Thibaut Courtois after he made excellent stops to deny Eric Garcia and Yamal, but there was nothing he could do to stop the former's header in the 19th minute. The galvanised hosts kept pushing for an equaliser and got it in spectacular fashion when Yamal curled a stunning finish past a helpless Courtois just after the half-hour mark from the edge of the area.

A shell-shocked Madrid, who were still finding joy on the transition and with long balls over the top, could not handle Barca's high press and coughed up a third goal two minutes later through Raphinha. Then, mere moments after Los Blancos had a penalty overturned for offside in the build-up, Raphinha pinched the ball off a dawdling Lucas Vazquez, and then Ferran Torres set him up to tuck the ball home on the stroke of half-time.

Yamal looked to have grabbed his second after the break when he tapped in Raphinha's pass across the six-yard box, but the Barca captain was offside in the build-up. And just when it looked like the league leaders would cruise to victory, the lethal Mbappe grabbed his hat-trick after Vinicius Jr neatly set up the 26-year-old.

Raphinha then missed a sitter to put the contest to bed, and despite a nervy finale, which included both Mbapp and Fermin Lopez having goals chalked off, Hansi Flick's team moved seven points clear at the top of La Liga with just three matches remaining having beaten Madrid all four times in all competitions this season.

The Danish striker missed three clear chances, but the worst sight on a grim Sunday was the young French defender hobbling off the pitch

Manchester United were brought back down to earth after their euphoric passage to the Europa League final as they slumped to their first home defeat against West Ham in 18 years, going down 2-0 and sinking all the way to 16th in the Premier League table. And to make matters worse, they will almost certainly be without Leny Yoro in the final after the Frenchman limped off the pitch while looking utterly distraught having suffered a foot injury.

Former United full-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka was in brilliant form against his old club, playing a huge role in Tomas Soucek's first-half opening strike and then setting up Jarrod Bowen to score the second goal. Bowen's goal further killed the mood after Yoro had been forced off and had to be comforted by Harry Maguire as he trotted down the tunnel, almost certainly believing he will miss the showdown in Bilbao against Tottenham on May 21.

United's European run has been the only good thing about their dire campaign and this defeat, their 17th of the season, was a reminder of how big a job Ruben Amorim faces in making his side a force again in the competition that matters the most.

Jamie Carragher has said what he believes Liverpool should set as the price for Real Madrid to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold ahead of the Club World Cup this summer.

Alexander-Arnold announced earlier this month that he will leave Liverpool at the end of his contract on the back of the Reds wrapping up their second Premier League title.

Real Madrid have reportedly agreed terms with the England international, but the Spanish giants want Liverpool to release Alexander-Arnold before his contract expires on June 30, so that he can play in the all-new Club World Cup, starting on June 14.

But Carragher has urged his former club to ask Madrid for a £10m fee if they want them to rip Alexander-Arnold's contract up early, given how much money Los Blancos could earn through the tournament.

Carragher said on Sky Sports: “You're announcing it now to give Real Madrid the opportunity to maybe sign you for the Club World Cup, so that's what I was talking about a couple of weeks ago.”

Neville then interjected: “Would you take like a million quid if you were Liverpool for the Club World Cup?”

Carragher then replied: “Er, I think I'd want more than a million quid.”

Neville then further asked: “But would you take, would you take whatever price it would be to let him go and play in that tournament?”

Carragher replied: “I think if it was about five or ten million quid, because I think I could get, no, hang on, hang on.”

Sky Sports host David Jones then asked: “What is it, a hundred million to win the thing?”

Carragher replied: “Exactly. Have you seen how much money it is to win it?”

Jones then asked: “So you could help a major European rival by helping them win the thing?”

Carragher said: “Right, well, but if they're going to win a hundred million and he's going to help them, because don't forget, they haven't got any right back. The right back to play in there is not a right back. So it's not just like bringing a player in. Give us ten million quid.”

Neville concluded: “Well, the price has just been set, mate.”

👉 Mikel Arteta ‘openly disliked by staff' as report reveals Liverpool nonsense ‘didn't go down brilliantly'

Former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan has encouraged Liverpool to stand firm because Real Madrid are “not a charity”.

“Good for them – why shouldn't they? Do Liverpool want to be a contributing factor to Real Madrid being crowned in inaugural Club World Cup champions?” Jordan said.

“He'd keep you to the contract if there wasn't an alternative. He wouldn't be saying: ‘I've finished my last game so I don't need to be paid up to June 30'. Because the circumstances have changed and he's already got himself an outcome and Madrid want this outcome.

“If you go to this tournament, what do you get if you win it? £100 million and if Liverpool give them a player to help them with that, they've just given Madrid £100 million to make sure Madrid can maintain their dominance in European football so why? They're not a charity.

“Of course, they are (a direct rival). Who are going to be playing in the Champions League next year? It would be commercial sense. So what. Trent Alexander-Arnold has achieved what he wanted to achieve and you can believe the benefits of Trent Alexander going on a free have landed where… in his pay packet.”



Jamie Carragher says Arteta's Arsenal legacy may be ‘years of groundwork for the benefit of a successor' if he fails to win trophies next season.


Pundit Alan Shearer has picked out a potential Trent Alexander-Arnold replacement for Premier League champions Liverpool to sign.


Carragher claims Arteta currently sounds more like a ‘social media fan' than Arsenal manager after his recent complaints about Liverpool and PSG.


According to reports, Liverpool have picked out the right-back they ‘want to sign' as they look to replace Trent Alexander-Arnold. 


Liverpool have been told to “bend over” Real Madrid and set an “extraordinary” demand for the Spanish giants to land Trent Alexander-Arnold “early”. 


Joe Cole has discussed the best position for Trent Alexander-Arnold at Real Madrid, after listing off four players he will not get in the team ahead of.

Real Madrid are currently on course to end the season without a major trophy, but they could get some respite with the Club World Cup, which they are one of the favourites to win this summer. But there is a chance that they will go into the tournament without one of their best players.

Jude Bellingham has been nursing a shoulder problem for well over a year, with the original injury having occurred in November 2023 during a match between Real Madrid and Rayo Vallecano. And since then, the England international has wore armour-like strapping on the affected area, of which the amount has gradually increased in order to ensure protection from further aggravation.

The situation will come to an end this summer as Bellingham is set to undergo surgery, but as Relevo have reported, it is not clear when exactly he will go under the knife.

Bellingham would be sidelined for a number of weeks upon undergoing surgery, which is why he has not yet had it. If he were to wait after the conclusion of Real Madrid's participation at the Club World Cup, it would be inevitable that he misses the start of the 2025-26 season, which is something that club bosses are keen to avoid.

As such, there is also the possibility of Bellingham having surgery at the end of the season, but before the Club World Cup. In this case, he would not travel to the United States, but he would be fine for pre-season.

The final scenario could see Bellingham undergo surgery as early as next week. Defeat in El Clasico would all-but ensure that Real Madrid miss out on the La Liga title, and with the domestic season basically done in this case, there is scope for the operation to happen as soon as possible – but the club itself is not keen on this.

Bellingham himself is keen to have surgery as soon as possible, which is understandable given the pain he has been in over the last 18 months. It remains to be seen whether he goes under the knife in May, June or July.

Former Germany international Gerald Asamoah has revealed why African countries will struggle to win the FIFA World Cup.

The closest Africa has come to the World Cup trophy, was in the 2022 edition in Qatar, where Morocco played in the semifinals but lost to Croatia in the third/fourth place game. 

Asamoah, 46, helped Germany finish second to Brazil at the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and Korea after being neglected by his homeland Ghana.

The burley former Schalke forward believes countries from the African continent still face challenges in competing at the highest level of global football.

"I want to see this before I leave the earth, but it is not going to be easy," he said, as reported by Joy Sports.

"It is about teamwork, and this is a problem Africans have. We have always had some issues in the team," he added.

Ghana and Senegal have come close to making it to the quarterfinals, but have ultimately fallen short of clinching the trophy.

The next World Cup will be held in 2026 across the USA, Canada and Mexico, with qualifiers still ongoing.

Ghana's Black Stars, who sit top of Group I with 15 points, are on course to qualify for the tournament. They will face Chad and Mali in September's World Cup qualifiers.

Enrique Sanz

Real Madrid faces the final stretch of the current league campaign focused on the fight for first place against FC Barcelona. In addition to those four matches that will be decisive for one of the most important titles of the season, the offices at Valdebebas are also focused on the upcoming Club World Cup.

Indeed, the board of directors led by Florentino Pérez has made it clear on more than one occasion that it is a tournament of great importance for the first team. That's why all competitive efforts, especially regarding injured players, are focused on the competition to be held in the United States during the months of June and July.

The footballer who might miss out on that desired competition is Jude Bellingham. The English "5" has been responsible for many of Real Madrid's sporting successes since he joined the first team, but most of his time is marked by an ailment. His left shoulder, injured since November 2023, has caused certain problems for the Birmingham midfielder.

The option of undergoing surgery arose last summer, but Jude Bellingham decided to forgo that opportunity due to the imminence of the Euro Cup in Germany in the summer of 2024. The discomfort has continued throughout the current season, bringing the footballer to a breaking point where he would need to make that trip to the operating room as soon as possible.

The information revealed by "Rodra" states that Jude Bellingham would like to undergo his operation as soon as possible, given that the recovery from that intervention is approximately one month. Undergoing the intervention at the end of the current LaLiga season, following the wishes of the British player, would leave him out for the Club World Cup.

That's why Real Madrid would have a different perspective on this situation. The journalist from "Relevo" recalls: the club understands that the ideal time for Bellingham to undergo surgery is after the Club World Cup, a competition that the entity has marked as strategic. This creates the dilemma and the two different opinions on the timeline of the operation.

The reality is that Jude Bellingham has been avoiding the opportunity to undergo the necessary operation to correct his shoulder ailment for too long. The presence of the Euro Cup last summer, as well as the Club World Cup in a month, jeopardizes the ideal time for him to go to the operating room.

Everything will depend on future conversations of the player himself, as well as his entourage, with Real Madrid. The white sports management hopes to register the English footballer for the competition to be held in the United States... but Jude Bellingham might undergo surgery at the end of this season to return in perfect condition for the 25/26 season, already under the tactical command of the new merengue coach.

The excitement for the tournament will begin in earnest once the final participant is confirmed.

The revamped Club World Cup is just over one month away as the best teams from across the planet prepare to collide in the United States.

A total of 32 teams will compete in the 2025 Club World Cup, but one final team has yet to be confirmed following the confirmation of Leon's expulsion. MLS team Los Angeles FC or Liga MX side Club America will face off for the right to take their place in the newly updated tournament.

So, when will the winner-takes-all playoff match be played? GOAL brings you everything you need to know.

The playoff match for the final place in the 2025 Club World Cup is set to be played on Saturday, May 31, 2025. The kick-off time has not yet been confirmed. BMO Stadium in Los Angeles - which is the home ground of LAFC and NWSL team Angel City - will host the game.

Fixture:

Los Angeles FC vs Club America

Date:

May 31, 2025

Kick-off time:

To be confirmed

Venue:

BMO Stadium, Los Angeles

With the playoff match set for May 31, it leaves just two weeks for the victor to make plans and prepare for their participation in the tournament, which is set to be played from mid-June into mid-July.

The 2025 Club World Cup will be broadcast worldwide on DAZN, and a selection of matches will be available to watch live on the TNT network in the United States. Channel 5 is the official broadcast partner United Kingdom.

While no streaming service or television channel has been confirmed yet for the Club World Cup playoff, we can reasonably expect it to be available on DAZN at a minimum.

The winner of the playoff match between Los Angeles FC and Club America will go into Group D, the group that Leon had previously been drawn into.

Group D also contains Premier League giants Chelsea, Brazilian behemoths Flamengo and North African outfit ES Tunis.

						Senegal and Portugal will go head-to-head for the third place					

Belarus win 5-2 against Senegal.
The first semi-final of the tournament delivered a gripping encounter between two teams making their second appearances at this stage – Belarus and Senegal.

Belarus opened the scoring three minutes into the game through their goalkeeper Avgustov, whose long-range strike took a bounce in front of Senegal's goalkeeper and found the back of the net to give his side a 1-0 lead. Senegal responded in the last minutes of the opening period, as Sidy skilfully flicked in a shot from Diatta to make the score at 1-1.

Belarus came out firing in the second period. Bryshtsel restored their advantage with a well-placed penalty driven into the left side of the net to make it 2-1. Moments later, Hapon extended their lead with a flying header. Belarus continued to apply pressure, and Bryshtsel struck again, securing his brace with a composed finish inside the final two minutes of the period, to put Belarus 4-1 ahead heading into the final period.

Senegal showed resilience in the third period. Diagne pulled a goal back two minutes in with a smart finish to reduce the deficit. However, Belarus maintained their composure and Bokach capitalised on a counter-attack to score Belarus' fifth, to seal an emphatic 5-2 victory and create history for the nation.

Brazil win 4-2 against Portugal.
Brazil overpowered Portugal to reach a consecutive FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup final. In a heavyweight semi-final clash, defending champions and six-time winners Brazil faced off against two-time champions Portugal, who struck first midway through the opening period. Brilhante delivered a pinpoint cross to Bernardo, who rose to head the ball into the net, giving Portugal a 1-0 lead.

Brazil responded early in the second period. Just a minute in, Thanger produced a spectacular acrobatic finish from an assist by Mauricinho to level the score at 1-1. Moments later, Filipe Silva fired a long-range shot into the net to put Brazil in front. Portugal fought back, and midway through the period Lourenço's goal brought his team back on level terms.

The final period was decisive. Brazil captain Rodrigo calmly converted a spot kick early in the period to reclaim a 3-2 lead. With momentum shifting, Brazil capitalised via a quick transition, and Catarino found the net with four minutes left to play. Brazil aggressively managed the closing minutes, stifling any Portuguese comeback attempts, as the holders marched on to yet another final, with a 4-2 win over Portugal.

World Cup

This is the fourth in a series on The Athletic looking back at the winners of each men's World Cup. Previous articles have looked at Uruguay in 1930, Italy in 1934 and then again in 1938. In 1950, Uruguay were crowned champions again to make it 2-2 between the two countries.

Due to the Second World War, 12 years had passed since the previous World Cup in France — during which time the Jules Rimet Trophy had supposedly been stashed underneath the bed of Ottorino Barassi, president of the Italian football federation. As they retained their world title in 1938, his nation had held the game's most prestigious piece of silverware for 16 years. Uruguay had been the only other winners of the tournament in its inaugural staging. And they would come out on top again here.

Brazil were awarded the hosting rights for World Cup 1950 and were therefore considered favourites to win it on home soil, just as Uruguay and Italy had done in 1930 and 1934 respectively.

There was still something of an issue in terms of general participation.

Only 31 of the 73 FIFA member nations entered, with Argentina refusing to compete in a tournament they'd wanted to host, West Germany banned from FIFA so soon after the war, previous finalists Austria and Czechoslovakia simply not entering, and Italy present but badly affected by the Superga air disaster in May 1949, in which several of their best players had died. Then France withdrew after realising the considerable travelling that would be involved between games in a country as huge as Brazil.

Brazil's downstairs neighbours Uruguay, obviously, didn't have to come far, and while the European nations struggled with the South American climate, it wasn't really an issue for the competition's 1930 winners.

The structure of this tournament was somewhat bizarre, with Uruguay the major beneficiaries.

The previous World Cup in 1938 had been contested as a straight-knockout tournament, but FIFA — controversially at the time — voted to move to a system featuring four groups of four, with the winners of each one progressing to the next stage.

But withdrawals left the World Cup with only 13 competing teams, not 16. It was too late to conduct another draw, so Uruguay were fortunate to be placed in a two-team group alongside Bolivia (they had qualified without playing a game after Argentina withdrew), who they thrashed 8-0. Contemporary reports suggest the scoreline could have been much greater had the Uruguayans — three up after 23 minutes — not eased off.

Furthermore, no actual final was scheduled. The top four were to be decided on round-robin results in another (four-team) group, and therefore the organisers simply got lucky that Uruguay and Brazil, the two sides in contention for the trophy going into the final pair of games, met then at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro.

A draw would have been enough for Brazil to finish top of the final group and so lift the World Cup, which would have been a quite unsatisfactory climax. Uruguay needed a win. That final game was therefore not literally the final, but has come to generally be considered as such.

While doubt persists about whether Uruguay's victorious manager in 1930 was truly a manager by today's definition of the job, there is scepticism about whether their manager in 1950 had complete authority over his side.

While Juan Lopez Fontana had that role officially, the players grew unhappy with his defensive approach. Ahead of that final game against Brazil, the team held a meeting where they were encouraged by captain Obdulio Varela to be braver than Lopez Fontana had requested.

Indeed, at this stage in football's development, a team's captain was often considered more influential than the manager. Varela was commended for his pre-match team talks, for ordering his team-mates to behave in certain ways at key moments, and, after the tournament, for disobeying orders not to leave the team hotel, and going out drinking with Brazilians instead.

Lopez Fontana, in fairness, was a highly respected figure who was still in his job come the 1954 World Cup, then served as an assistant to several subsequent Uruguay managers.

While other national teams had shifted towards a system featuring a third defender — the centre-half dropping back — Uruguay's base formation was more closely related to the system used by previous World Cup-winning sides: two physical defenders, three half-backs, two creative inside-forwards, two quick wingers and a centre-forward.

That said, left-half Victor Andrade (nephew of fellow World Cup winner Jose Andrade from 1930) was written about in almost purely defensive terms, and right-half Schubert Gambetta is also sometimes listed as a defender, too. As other nations beefed up their defence by having the centre-half drop back, Uruguay were gradually moving their right-half and left-half in the same direction. This is why — as Jonathan Wilson notes in his book Inverting The Pyramid — Uruguay are unique in using the No 4 and No 6 as their full-backs in their traditional numbering system.

Like every successful side in these early years of the World Cup, Uruguay 1950 had an outstanding centre-half in Varela, who was physically dominant and also a key attacking weapon. His late, long-range equaliser to secure a 2-2 draw with Spain in their opening match of the final group stage was crucial in allowing them to challenge for the trophy.



Juan Alberto Schiaffino had all the hallmarks of a legendary South American attacker: slender, elegant, highly creative. He was regularly described as a ‘genius' and played as the inside-left in Uruguay's five-man attacking line. He was a clever passer, an elusive dribbler and a prolific goalscorer all in one, notching three goals in this World Cup — including their second-half equaliser in the final.

He was also highly influential four years later at the next World Cup in Switzerland — Uruguay held Hungary, the outstanding side of that tournament, to a 2-2 draw after 90 minutes in the semi-final, but once Schiaffino got injured, they ran out of ideas.

Schiaffino spent the majority of his career with Penarol, who he later managed, in his hometown of Montevideo. Upon his move to Milan following that 1954 tournament, he adopted a deeper role, roughly in the Andrea Pirlo mould, before eventually dropping back even further to become a renowned sweeper for Roma.

Like many South Americans of this period who moved to Serie A, he also switched international allegiance and began to represent Italy rather than his homeland.

He only played 21 times for Uruguay, but he is probably their greatest ever footballer.

Brazil versus Uruguay. Bookmakers offered odds of just 1/10 for Brazil to lift the trophy, and there was such confidence across the host country after demolishing Sweden and Spain 7-1 and 6-1 respectively in their first two matches of the second group stage that various newspapers printed front pages on matchday hailing the anticipated triumph.

The modern convention is for opponents to pin these pages up on the dressing-room wall as motivation. Uruguay took things a step further and used them to line the floor of their bathroom. This didn't help their inside-right Julio Perez, who was so intimidated by the crowd (174,000 officially, possibly around 200,000 unofficially, and probably the largest in football history) that he wet himself as the anthems were being played.

Foreshadowing Brazil's collapse, shortly before the game, their flag was raised… upside-down.

Once the match kicked off, it was all Brazil, with Uruguay defending their box manfully and hoofing the ball clear rather than putting together any notable counter-attacks. But both sides hit the post before half-time — Oscar Miguez for Uruguay, Jair for Brazil.

Brazil went ahead barely a minute into the second half, with Friaca firing a low shot into the far corner from the right flank. This prompted Uruguay captain Varela to pick an argument with George Reader, the English referee, over a non-existent offside, which included him requesting an interpreter at one stage. Varela knew there had been no offside, he simply wanted to halt Brazil's momentum.

Uruguay hit back, and their key player was now Alcides Ghiggia, who constantly motored past Brazil's hapless left-half Bigode. Midway through the half, he beat Bigode, looked up and found Schiaffino making a run to the near post for a cutback. The ball bobbled slightly before Schiaffino hit it, but this meant he produced a shot with both power and curl inside the near post, although he later admitted he hadn't intended to strike it quite in that manner. No matter, it was 1-1.

That result would still see Brazil crowned champions. But the momentum was now with Uruguay.

Ghiggia was the star player in the final, and having galloped down the Uruguay right to create the opener, he threatened to do the same thing 11 minutes from the end of the 90.

Schiaffino was waiting to score a carbon-copy goal, and that's what Brazil goalkeeper Moacir Barbosa expected. But Ghiggia could also fire home at the near post, as he'd done a week earlier in that draw with Spain. That's what he did here, rifling home the winner.

Barbosa was regarded as Brazil's best-ever goalkeeper, but was harshly blamed for what was, by the standards of the time, a relatively minor error. He and Brazil's other black players received disgraceful abuse after this loss, being labelled unpatriotic, while Barbosa was forced to flee his home due to death threats.

Following this World Cup, Barbosa worked in an administrative role at the Maracana, the scene of his disastrous moment. Several years after the event, he was presented with the goalposts he'd allowed the ball to squeeze between. He sawed them up, took them home and burned them as a form of exorcism.

But that wasn't the end of his pain.

Brazil's treatment of him was despicable, considering he was possibly the country's best goalkeeper of the 20th century. More than 40 years after this match, in a country big on superstition, he was both removed as a commentator from the broadcast of a Brazil game and shunned when visiting the national team's training camp, because of fears he would bring them bad luck. He died in 2000, aged 79, after years of loneliness.

Amid all the anger they directed at their own team, Brazilians reacted sportingly to Uruguay's victory. They applauded the winners at their trophy presentation. Ghiggia was always respected in Brazil, returning to the Maracana in 2009 to be inducted into the stadium's walk of fame. He died in 2015 — 65 years to the day after his famous World Cup-clinching goal.

All sorts of quotes have been attributed to Ghiggia, some of which seem a bit too Hollywood to be taken seriously. But his summary of the key moment is a nice analysis of the risk-and-reward of shooting for the near post, rather than crossing. “Barbosa did the logical thing,” he reportedly said. “And I did the illogical thing.”

Surely not. Uruguay only played four games — two fewer than Brazil. Not only did they have the fortune to compete in a two-team opening group against minnows Bolivia, they didn't perform particularly well in the second one, having to come from behind in that 2-2 with Spain and only squeezing past Sweden 3-2 thanks to an 85th-minute goal.

In contrast, Brazil had beaten the same opponents by a combined score of 13-2, having previously finished top of their (four-team) first-round group via clean-sheet wins over Mexico (4-0) and Yugoslavia (2-0) and a 2-2 of their own with Switzerland.

In his history of the World Cup, Ian Morrison says their 1950 side played “some of the finest football ever played at international level”, while Brian Glanville described the Brazilians as playing “football of the future — tactically unexceptional but technically superb”. Their three central attackers, in particular — Jair, Zizinho and Ademir — received rave reviews for their combination play.

But ultimately, Brazil, as a nation, exuded overconfidence going into the final game, and the players themselves suffered from nerves — not for the last time in a World Cup.

Often, knockout competition can produce the ‘wrong' winners, but this World Cup was decided by a league table, which tends to favour the better sides on paper, and Brazil still couldn't get over the line.

They would have to keep on waiting. By the time of the next World Cup, they had ditched their white kit, now associated with this 1950 failure, in favour of the yellow, green and blue strip known worldwide today.

Four editions in, the World Cup had still been won by only two nations, with Italy and Uruguay crowned champions of the two tournaments played on their home continents of Europe and South America respectively.

But things were about to change in 1954.

Good news after good news.

Of course, it had to happen. Despite the day being about Bayern Munich's victory over Borussia Mönchengladbach, successful Bundesliga title victory and the last days of Thomas Müller's career at the Die Rekordmeister, a reporter inevitably still prepared questions about transfers. Board member for sport Max Eberl was the victim in this case, being bombarded with questions about potential transfer targets Jonathan Tah and Florian Wirtz as well as the Club World Cup and summer transfer window business.

Eberl refused to talk about Wirtz or Tah, but he did address the Club World Cup, thoughts about registering new transfers for the competition and a surprising reveal: “Because we have this new registration window between June 1 and June 10, we will be able to register [confirmed transfer in January from TSG Hoffenheim] Tom Bischof,” Eberl confirmed in a post match interview. “He will be there. And if you are speaking to people about transfers- more incoming than departing transfers- and it is possible, then you have the chance to do it and it would be nice to have that player for the Club World Cup.”

This certainly raises a few more questions, though. Who are Bayern in talks with that could join before the Club World Cup? The June registration window ends in about a month, after all. Eberl also hinted that departing players may not necessarily be kept for the Club World Cup. Müller signed a short term extension but someone like Eric Dier, who is already confirmed to be leaving the club at the end of his contract on June 30, may not participate in the tournament at all, even though the group stages take place before the end of June.

Nick Kyrgios, the Australian tennis maverick, is gearing up for what could potentially be his last hurrah at Wimbledon this summer. Despite battling injuries since his remarkable run to the Wimbledon final in 2022, Kyrgios is contemplating a rare appearance at the French Open later this month.

The enigmatic player has been dropping hints about the possibility of retiring from tennis, citing his struggles with injuries as a major factor. However, he recently expressed a desire to give his favorite tournament, Wimbledon, another shot in 2025, where he narrowly missed out on the title to Novak Djokovic in 2022.

While Kyrgios acknowledges the challenges posed by his extended hiatus from the sport, he remains optimistic about his comeback. The fiery Australian believes in trusting the process and is determined to recapture his peak form from 2022. Despite doubts surrounding his physical and mental readiness, Kyrgios is eager to make his presence felt on the grass courts once again.

Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash has raised concerns about Kyrgios' ability to reclaim the top spot in tennis after such a prolonged absence. The physical demands of the game, especially in Grand Slam tournaments, pose a significant challenge for the returning player. However, Kyrgios' undeniable talent continues to fuel speculation about his potential resurgence.

In a surprising turn of events, Kyrgios has hinted at his participation in the French Open, a tournament he has been critical of in the past. Despite his reservations about clay court tennis, the Australian star is preparing to test his skills at Roland Garros, possibly for the last time. With limited success at the French Open in the past, Kyrgios aims to defy the odds and make a statement on the challenging surface.

As speculations swirl around Kyrgios' future in tennis, fans eagerly await his upcoming appearances at Wimbledon and potentially the French Open. Will this be the final chapter in Kyrgios' tumultuous yet captivating career? Only time will tell if the Australian powerhouse can rise once again to tennis glory.

Stay tuned for more updates on Nick Kyrgios' sensational comeback journey as he prepares to grace the hallowed courts of Wimbledon and Roland Garros.

Tennis - Italian Open - Foro Italico, Rome, Italy - May 10, 2025 Poland's Iga Swiatek in action during her round of 32 match against Danielle Collins of the U.S. REUTERS/Aleksandra Szmigiel

Iga Swiatek's Rollercoaster Journey: From Rome Setback to Roland Garros Redemption?

Polish tennis sensation Iga Swiatek is facing a rough patch ahead of the upcoming Roland Garros tournament. After a disappointing defeat in Madrid and another setback in Rome, Swiatek's confidence seems to be taking a hit. The former World No.1 is struggling to find her form, raising doubts about her prospects in the French Open this year.

In a surprising turn of events, Danielle Collins handed Swiatek a shocking loss at the Italian Open, marking her failure to advance beyond the R16 of a WTA 1000 event for the first time in four years. The defeat has left Swiatek devastated and questioning her game. Despite a dominant record against Collins in the past, Swiatek faltered in straight sets, signaling a potential crisis in her game.

During a candid post-match press conference, Swiatek acknowledged her shortcomings and expressed the need to make changes to her approach. Admitting her struggles, she confessed, “For sure, it hasn't been easy. For sure, I'm doing something wrong.” The Polish star's honest confession about her current form raises concerns about her readiness for the upcoming Grand Slam event.

With her confidence seemingly shaken, Swiatek candidly remarked, “Obviously it would be stupid to expect a lot because I'm not able to play my game right now.” Despite past champions finding success at Roland Garros despite poor form, Swiatek remains focused on her current challenges, emphasizing the unpredictable nature of each tennis season.

Reflecting on her past setbacks and triumphs, Swiatek's journey to the top has been marked by resilience and determination. Recalling her defeat in Rome five years ago before clinching her first French Open title, Swiatek's ability to bounce back from adversity highlights her champion mentality. As she navigates through her current struggles, the tennis world eagerly anticipates whether Swiatek can stage another remarkable comeback at Roland Garros this year.

As the clay court season unfolds, all eyes will be on Swiatek as she aims to rediscover her winning form and defend her title in Paris. Will she defy the odds once again and cement her status as a clay court queen? Tennis fans worldwide await the thrilling spectacle that is Iga Swiatek's quest for redemption at Roland Garros 2025.

Novak Djokovic is at one of the lowest points in his long career.

The Serbian is on a three-match losing streak and has withdrawn from tournaments to recalibrate ahead of the French Open. 

Djokovic is targeting his 25th Grand Slam. It would give him the most in history in both the men's and women's game. He's currently tied with Margaret Court with 24 titles. 

But one tennis legend believes Novak will struggle to reach that illustrious 25th Grand Slam. 

“I would never underestimate him, but I would be surprised if he won another major, let's put it that way,” 18-time Grand Slam winner Chrissie Evert said on a phone interview.

It's a tough thing to hear, especially from one of the best performers that Roland-Garros has ever seen. 

Evert has seven French Open titles: 1974, 1975, 1979, 1980, 1983, 1985, and 1986.

She has seen a lot of success, but believes Djokovic's declining abilities make him less likely to claim another Slam. 

“I mean, you've got to give the guy credit. This guy's won everything, more than anybody. I would never say he's not going to win, but I would be surprised. I would be pleasantly surprised, just with his results in the past and he's human…I'm not feeling it."

Ironically, Djokovic's last tournament win came at Roland-Garros, but it was the 2024 Olympics. That was his first gold medal ever and rounded out his trophy case with almost every major achievement.

One certain factor is that Djokovic always plays better when there are doubters or naysayers surrounding his performance. 

Now he has another opportunity to prove a notable tennis analyst wrong.

ROME (AP) — Top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka fought back from a set down against Sofia Kenin to advance at the Italian Open on Sunday. 

Kenin, the No. 31-seeded American, won the first set of the third round match in Rome 6-3, but Sabalenka powered back to take the next two sets by the same score.

U.S. Open champion Sabalenka will play Ukrainian Marta Kostyuk in the next round.

Coco Gauff was playing Magda Linette later on Sunday in the women's draw. 

On the men's side, Carlos Alcaraz was playing Laslo Djere and defending champion Alexander Zverev was playing Lithuanian qualifier Vilius Gaubas.

The 2021 US Open champion is into the fourth round in only her second trip to the Foro Italico.ByDavid KanePublished May 11, 2025 copy_link

Published May 11, 2025

ROME, Italy—It's only her second appearance at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, but Emma Raducanu is starting to feel at home at the Foro Italico as she adapts a “When in Rome” mindset to her post-match meals.“I've started having pasta!” the 2021 US Open champion revealed. “I don't usually eat pasta but in Rome, I have it because I don't feel bad after it. It's quite good quality, as well. I've been having pasta, but no gelato yet.“I love the pomodoro sauce. The tomatoes are so good here, and I love guanciale.”Raducanu certainly earned her amatriciana on Sunday, rallying from a set down to defeat Veronika Kudermetova, 5-7, 6-0, 6-1, and secure a career-best result at a WTA 1000 on clay.

“I always said I think I have the potential to play really well on clay,” she said after her second round. “I don't think I'm there yet but I'm slowly kind of finding my feet. As I kind of use my forehand, use the spin, the serve improves, I think I'll be able to be really good on this surface. One benefit I do have is that I can play with variation and the courts, depending on time of day or opponent, I guess I can use it.“I think now I'm exploring my creativity a bit more on the court,” she added this afternoon. “I think I got very boxed into a certain way of playing, which was aggressive, dominating, feeling like I'm an aggressive baseliner. But I think I have more tools at my disposal, so in practice these days, I've just been kind of messing around with the ball and seeing what I can do, how creative I can be.”Injuries have largely prevented the 22-year-old from ever having a proper clay-court swing, showing flashes of her capabilities on indoor clay—reaching two quarterfinals the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix—but her efforts to become a more all-around player are paying off in Rome, where she'll next face No. 3 seed Coco Gauff for a spot in the quarterfinals.“I love Rome,” she said. “It's a great city with amazing culture. I think if you look around, it's one of the most beautiful places. With my game, I think I'm doing really well here; I'm putting things together a bit more. I think I'm exploring my variety but also, in my first two matches and the third set here, I had good ball speed and my forehand is also doing a lot of damage.”

Arthur Fils continued his impressive recent ATP Masters 1000 record and his dominance against Stefanos Tsitsipas at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome on Sunday, when he advanced to the fourth round following a high-quality display.

The dynamic Frenchman recovered from a slow start on Grand Stand Arena, where he entertained the crowd with his flashy shotmaking to earn a comeback 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory against Tsitsipas in one hour and 55 minutes.

"I told him at the net he was playing unbelievable in the first set," Fils said. "He was killing me with his forehand, his backhand, at the net. Serving very good. I could not do a lot of things but in the second set I started to find the rhythm and a way to fight and was happy to finish strong in the third."



Fils played aggressively in the second and third sets, taking large cuts of the ball off both wings to pin Tsitsipas back, while he held his nerve down the closing stage to reach the fourth round at a Masters 1000 event for the fifth time in his past six events.

The 20-year-old, competing at a career-high No. 14 in the PIF ATP Rankings, has often found his best level at Masters 1000 level in 2025, advancing to quarter-finals in Indian Wells, Miami and Monte-Carlo.

At the ATP 500 event in Barcelona last month, Fils reached the semi-finals, moving past Tsitsipas on the way. He now holds a standout 4-0 Lexus ATP Head2Head series record against the former Nitto ATP Finals champion following his latest win.

"If you let him play, I think he is one of the best clay-court players," Fils said on Tsitsipas. "His forehand is a huge weapon. I tried to put him under pressure because if I am not putting him under pressure I am dead."

Fils is 7-2 against Top 20 players on clay since the start of 2024 and will look to improve that record when he meets the No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings Alexander Zverev in the fourth round. Zverev beat Lithuanian qualifier Vilius Gaubas 6-4, 6-0 in 86 minutes.

"I didn't play my best in the first set but he challenged me... He has won four matches here already, beating quality players like Denis [Shapovalov]," Zverev said. "I have huge respect for guys coming through qualifying and guys coming through on Tour. I have been there myself, a long time ago, but I have been there. He is playing great tennis and I am sure we will see more of him."

The defending champion Zverev, who also triumphed in the Italian capital in 2017, was comfortable throughout his third-round win and has now won his his past nine matches in Rome. The German is seeking his second trophy of the season after winning on home soil in Munich last month.

"In the beginning I felt like it was a bit difficult for me and it was really windy," Zverev said. "The wind really calmed down after the first set and then it was easier for me to get in a rhythm and have clean strokes. I am someone who wants to play with power and doesn't have variety as much, so for me when I am hitting the ball cleanly it is a benefit to me and my game."






Daniil Medvedev was also an early winner on Day 5 in the Italian capital, where he dispatched Alexei Popyrin 6-4, 6-1.
Medvedev has fond memories in Rome, having lifted the trophy in 2023. Seeking his first title since then, the 10th seed will take confidence from his dominant win against Popyrin.

Arthur Fils continued his impressive recent ATP Masters 1000 record and his dominance against Stefanos Tsitsipas at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome on Sunday, when he advanced to the fourth round following a high-quality display.

The dynamic Frenchman recovered from a slow start on Grand Stand Arena, where he entertained the crowd with his flashy shotmaking to earn a comeback 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory against Tsitsipas in one hour and 55 minutes.

"I told him at the net he was playing unbelievable in the first set," Fils said. "He was killing me with his forehand, his backhand, at the net. Serving very good. I could not do a lot of things but in the second set I started to find the rhythm and a way to fight and was happy to finish strong in the third."



Fils played aggressively in the second and third sets, taking large cuts of the ball off both wings to pin Tsitsipas back, while he held his nerve down the closing stage to reach the fourth round at a Masters 1000 event for the fifth time in his past six events.

The 20-year-old, competing at a career-high No. 14 in the PIF ATP Rankings, has often found his best level at Masters 1000 level in 2025, advancing to quarter-finals in Indian Wells, Miami and Monte-Carlo.

At the ATP 500 event in Barcelona last month, Fils reached the semi-finals, moving past Tsitsipas on the way. He now holds a standout 4-0 Lexus ATP Head2Head series record against the former Nitto ATP Finals champion following his latest win.

"If you let him play, I think he is one of the best clay-court players," Fils said on Tsitsipas. "His forehand is a huge weapon. I tried to put him under pressure because if I am not putting him under pressure I am dead."

Fils is 7-2 against Top 20 players on clay since the start of 2024 and will look to improve that record when he meets the No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings Alexander Zverev in the fourth round. Zverev beat Lithuanian qualifier Vilius Gaubas 6-4, 6-0 in 86 minutes.

"I didn't play my best in the first set but he challenged me... He has won four matches here already, beating quality players like Denis [Shapovalov]," Zverev said. "I have huge respect for guys coming through qualifying and guys coming through on Tour. I have been there myself, a long time ago, but I have been there. He is playing great tennis and I am sure we will see more of him."

The defending champion Zverev, who also triumphed in the Italian capital in 2017, was comfortable throughout his third-round win and has now won his his past nine matches in Rome. The German is seeking his second trophy of the season after winning on home soil in Munich last month.

"In the beginning I felt like it was a bit difficult for me and it was really windy," Zverev said. "The wind really calmed down after the first set and then it was easier for me to get in a rhythm and have clean strokes. I am someone who wants to play with power and doesn't have variety as much, so for me when I am hitting the ball cleanly it is a benefit to me and my game."

Jannik Sinner is back to winning ways after his three-month suspension, having emerged victorious in his first match at the Italian Open.

Sinner has doubts ahead of his next match, despite beating Mariano Navone 6-3, 6-4 in his second round test.

The ATP Tour number one received a bye in the first round of the Italian Open, where Sinner is the top seed.

He now meets Jesper De Jong in the third round of the ATP Masters 1000 event, his first since the Australian Open.

The three-time Grand Slam champion lifted the title in Melbourne in January, but accepted a three-month doping ban shortly after.

He received a hugely warm welcome at the Italian Open, with former world number one Jim Courier now sharing how those fans would have felt while watching the home favourite in action.

Speaking of the player's level, Courier said on the Tennis Channel Live Podcast: “They may not have had the same low expectations in the stands. They were excited to see Sinner back on court here in Rome and he did not disappoint.

“If he had any nerves or rust he was not showing it early on. It looked very, very similar to the guy we last saw in Australia holding the trophy.

“He was attacking off of both wings, taking it to Navone, who is a high quality clay court player and we are talking about Navone yesterday, who is a guy who does not necessarily have overt power off the groundstrokes but today he did.

“He decided to try and nuke his ground strokes as the match went on to try and match Sinner, as the first set he was just getting left behind.

“But Sinner, the drop shot, he has the finesse and the movement. He was very good at the net today. This is a welcome return to form and the tour to Jannik Sinner.”

Sinner needed one hour and 38 minutes to make it past Navone, who certainly tested his opponent on occasion.

Many home fans may have feared their star man might have been rusty heading into the match, which was certainly a possibility given his lack of competitive action.

But the hard work on the practice courts has clearly paid off, although Sinner would have also been buoyed by the huge reception he received in Rome.

Sharing his take on the match, journalist Jon Wertheim noted: “I would say he could not ask for anything more.

“When we learned about the terms of his ban I think a lot of people said well he is not going to miss a major.

“Other people said not only that but he gets to come back for Rome. His own country's Masters 1000. He is an Italian player, he got a nice reception, and I think that is part of this as well.

“This was an easy, hospitable way to rejoin the tour and he did not look like a guy whose last match was the Australian Open final.”

ROME - Canada's Bianca Andreescu is through to the fourth round of the Italian Open WTA 1000 tennis tournament after posting a 6-2, 6-4 victory over No. 11 seed Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan on Sunday.

Andreescu, a 24-year-old from Mississauga, Ont., converted three break points and saved five to win the third-round match in one hour 27 minutes.

The 2019 U.S. Open champion is back on the comeback trail after recently returning from nearly six months off the WTA Tour.

Currently ranked 121st, Andreescu earned her first win against a top-20 opponent since 2023 on Friday with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-2 victory against Donna Vekic of Croatia in the second round.

Rybakina hadn't dropped a set in three previous meetings with Andreescu, including a win in the second round of the Madrid Open last month. 

Andreescu will play the winner of a match between No. 8 Qinwen Zheng and No. 26 Magdalena Frech in the next round.

Elsewhere on Sunday, No. 24 seed Leylah Fernandez of Laval, Que., lost her third-round match 6-4, 6-2 to Marta Kostyuk of Ukraine.

Kostyuk hit five aces and converted four break points, compared to one for Fernandez, en route to victory.

Holger Rune collapsed completely on Sunday afternoon and is out of the ATP 1000 tournament in Rome after a marathon match in three sets against French Corentin Moutet.

In a match that lasted a grueling three hours and 46 minutes in the baking Italian sun, the Dane was in the end forced to surrender against the Frenchman losing 7-5, 5-7, 7-6.

The Danish tennis superstar, who is number ten in the world rankings, went into the match as big favorite against the Frenchman, who is ranked as world number 83.

Even so, the French had the necessary power to dominate most baseline duels in a first set in which he prevailed 7-5, before Rune gradually seemed to recover his gameplan in the second set which he won 7-5

Thus, the match had to be decided in the third set, which, like the previous two, had to be decided in a virtual nail-biter.

The match was characterized by far too many Danish mistakes, and a staggering eight double faults from Holger Rune proved decisive.

Holger Rune is usually a specialist in decisive tiebreakers but it didn't work out for the Dane this time as he lost 7-4 and is thus out of one of the big warmup tournaments for the French Open in June.

Nick Kyrgios looks set to make what may be a final appearance at Wimbledon this summer and he could also make a rare appearance at the French Open later this month.

Aussie maverick Kyrgios has struggled with injuries since his run to the 2022 Wimbledon final and he has given several hints that he will quit tennis.

Yet he also hinted at the start of 2025 that he would have a final shot of making a run at his favourite tournament at Wimbledon, where he lost in the 2022 final against Novak Djokovic.

“For me, obviously this year I've been out for a year and a half, two years, so I don't know what this year's going to bring,” he said after struggling with injuries as he was beaten in his opening match at the Australian Open in January.

“Obviously, I'm going to trust the process, I think I'm hitting the ball great. I've still got a long way to get back to that same level I was in 2022.

What represents success in tennis? Why trophies and rankings are not always a gauge of victory

“For me personally, I couldn't see myself playing more than probably this year high-level singles anymore. “I think I'm weighing up my options.”

A fully fit Kyrgios could be a threat on grass courts, but former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash told Tennis365 that his fellow Aussie will struggle to come back to the top of the game after so long on the sidelines with injuries.

“He's been out for two years and that's a long time. He needs to be super-fit to get through matches back-to-back,” Cash told Tennis365. “Over three sets, he will probably be okay to do it, but can he do it over five sets in a Grand Slam?

“He's always had the ability, but it is issues with his mind and his body that have held him back. It's good that he's playing. There's nothing worse than being injured and I have known enough about that in my career.

“The talent is there, but you would question the physical side of it in longer matches when you have been out for so long.”

Kyrgios has given a big hint that he will also look to play the French Open later this month, after confirming he is practising on clay courts.

He has been damning about his views of clay court tennis in recent years, but it appears he is ready to try his luck for one last time at Roland Garros after posting a message on his social media platform confirming he is preparing to play in Paris later this month.

Kyrgios could enter the tournament using his protected ranking that is given to players who have been out of action for an extended period due to injury.

He has had limited success at Roland Garros, with his runs to the third round in 2015 and 2016 the best efforts he can look back on from his trips to the French capital.

Nick Kyrgios looks set to make what may be a final appearance at Wimbledon this summer and he could also make a rare appearance at the French Open later this month.

Aussie maverick Kyrgios has struggled with injuries since his run to the 2022 Wimbledon final and he has given several hints that he will quit tennis.

Yet he also hinted at the start of 2025 that he would have a final shot of making a run at his favourite tournament at Wimbledon, where he lost in the 2022 final against Novak Djokovic.

“For me, obviously this year I've been out for a year and a half, two years, so I don't know what this year's going to bring,” he said after struggling with injuries as he was beaten in his opening match at the Australian Open in January.

“Obviously, I'm going to trust the process, I think I'm hitting the ball great. I've still got a long way to get back to that same level I was in 2022.

What represents success in tennis? Why trophies and rankings are not always a gauge of victory

“For me personally, I couldn't see myself playing more than probably this year high-level singles anymore. “I think I'm weighing up my options.”

A fully fit Kyrgios could be a threat on grass courts, but former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash told Tennis365 that his fellow Aussie will struggle to come back to the top of the game after so long on the sidelines with injuries.

“He's been out for two years and that's a long time. He needs to be super-fit to get through matches back-to-back,” Cash told Tennis365. “Over three sets, he will probably be okay to do it, but can he do it over five sets in a Grand Slam?

“He's always had the ability, but it is issues with his mind and his body that have held him back. It's good that he's playing. There's nothing worse than being injured and I have known enough about that in my career.

“All good,” promised the Frenchman, who earned his sixth Top 20 win of the season.ByDavid KanePublished May 11, 2025 copy_link

Published May 11, 2025

ROME, Italy—The match was over but the battle looked like it was only beginning between Arthur Fils and Stefanos Tsitsipas, who were separated by umpire Gregory Allensworth after Fils clinched a 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 comeback at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia.The dispute ultimately stemmed from a misunderstanding when Fils was tagged at the net by a Tsitsipas passing shot; Fils didn't see the apology given by the former world No. 3.“All good,” insisted Fils, who scored his sixth Top 20 win of the 2025 season. “We're just talking about the match. No worries.”The field may have to start worrying about Fils as the No. 13 seed surged into a career-best result at the Foro Italico. With three Masters quarterfinals already under his belt this season, the 20-year-old has navigated tough opposition to continue his climb up the rankings.

The handshake between Fils and Tsitsipas devolved into a stirring debate, umpire Gregory Allensworth briefly stepping in between the two players.

“Everyone is playing great now on the tour. Of course, Stef is a huge champion; he made the finals of a Slam and everything. When you get to the third round here, you always play a seed, so you know it's going to be a tough match. I played Musetti in Indian Wells, Frances in Miami, Rublev in Monte Carlo. So, it's never an easy match but it's good for me to win them. It helps with my confidence, and it showed me that I'm working great.”Talking more broadly about Sunday's match, FIls described a strong win that helped him improve to 4-0 against Tsitsipas, a 2022 finalist in Rome.“It was tough,” said Fils. “He's a great, great, great player, especially on clay. During the first set, he killed me. I had to find a way. I managed to break at 4-4 with a great game, a bit lucky as well. But I'm very happy with how I finished the match. It was a tough battle, and I finished strong.”

The French star first grabbed headlines when he won his maiden ATP title in Lyon, the week before Roland Garros. Though Fils, who could face No. 2 seed Alexander Zverev in the fourth round, is poised to return to Paris among the dark horse contenders to win the Coupe des Mousquetaires, the Courcouronnes native is trying not to look too far ahead.“I'm still focused on here,” said Fils. “It's a tough tournament, Rome. It's a Masters 1000 with a lot of points, a lot of great players. Everyone is here. I have to stay focused on this tournament and then I will go to the French Open. Of course, it's always better to play good before the French Open than to play bad.”

Tennis icon Chris Evert has cast doubt on Novak Djokovic's chances of winning another Grand Slam title while also asserting she “would never underestimate him.”

Djokovic‘s most recent Grand Slam triumph was the record-extending 24th men's major title he secured at the 2023 US Open.

The former world No 1, who will turn 38 on May 22, will have his next opportunity to add to his major tally at the 2025 French Open, which will run from May 25 to June 8.

The Serbian has lost the last three matches he has played in straight sets, with a defeat to Jakub Mensik in the Miami Open final followed by disappointing opening match exits in Monte Carlo and Madrid.

Djokovic chose to skip the Italian Open after his Madrid loss to Matteo Arnaldi, and he has added the event in Geneva to his schedule in the week before Roland Garros. He also played the ATP 250 in Switzerland last year.

The world No 6 reached the quarter-finals at last year's French Open before he was forced to withdraw ahead of his match with Casper Ruud with a meniscus tear. Djokovic won his third French Open title in 2023.

In an interview with Forbes, Evert shared her thoughts on Djokovic's Grand Slam quest ahead of the clay-court major.

“I would never underestimate him, but I would be surprised if he won another major, let's put it that way,” said the 18-time Grand Slam champion and former world No 1.

“I mean, you've got to give the guy credit. This guy's won everything, more than anybody. I would never say he's not going to win, but I would be surprised.

“I would be pleasantly surprised, just with his results in the past and he's human… I'm not feeling it.

“I've seen him play brilliantly on grass, and he's won Wimbledon so many times, that's why I can't say, ‘no, he's not gonna win another one.' I don't think it's gonna be the French Open… but you can never count him out.”

Djokovic recently proclaimed that he still has the desire to achieve more in his career.

“Obviously it's challenging for me nowadays to produce the results I had when I was at my best,” Djokovic told Business Traveler USA.

“It doesn't mean that I will never be able to do that again. But that greatness changes its shape, and that's because you're a different person on an annual basis, on a monthly basis, on a weekly basis.

“Tennis is a sport where it's necessary to nurture that mentality of, ‘It's never enough'. Because once it's enough, then it's really enough and you have to put the racket aside. And I still… I still don't feel it's enough for me.”

...

Venus Williams and Andre Agassi headline a star-studded line-up for TNT Sports and their French Open coverage later this month.

The seven-time Grand Slam champion has not played a competitive match in over a year, though she is yet to announce her retirement from the sport.

But the American will now form part of TNT Sports' coverage in the first year of a 10-year deal to cover the French Open, following a bumper $650m (£490m) deal signed last year between Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), the owner of TNT Sports, and the French Tennis Federation (FFT).

Williams will be joined by Agassi, and fellow Hall of Famers John McEnroe, Lindsay Davenport, Jim Courier, Chris Evert, Mats Wilander and Boris Becker as hosts, commentators and contributors.

The broadcaster states that Williams will contribute “special features” to the coverage in its inaugural UK and U.S coverage for Roland-Garros.

More talent comes in the shape of CoCo Vandeweghe, who won the 2018 US Open women's doubles title, Sam Querrey, the 10-time ATP singles champion and co-host of popular podcast ‘Nothing Major'.

While Sloane Stephens, a Roland-Garros singles finalist in 2018, and Chris Eubanks, still active on the ATP Tour, will also feature throughout the fortnight.

British fans can look forward to familiar faces Tim Henman and Laura Robson, with commentators Nick Mullins, Naomi Cavaday, Anne Keothavong and Miles Maclagan and presenters Rachel Stringer, Lesly Boitrelle and Craig Doyle.

World No 1 Jannik Sinner returns to action at the Italian Open this evening following the conclusion of his three-month doping ban.

Sinner has not played since winning the Australian Open in January for his third Grand Slam title after the Italian reached a resolution agreement with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).

He is now raring to return at his home tournament in Rome as he looks to build towards the next grand slam at the French Open later this month.

After receiving Sinner a bye to the second round as top seed, he will be welcomed back by Argentine player Mariano Navone in his opening match of the tournament, who beat Sinner's countryman Federico Cina in straight sets in the first round.

Follow all the build-up and action from Sinner's return below:

It's clay-court season, meaning we are well on the road to Roland Garros.

The French Open looks set to stage one of the most wide-open Grand Slams in recent years as Paris once again hosts the iconic tournament.

Here's everything you need to know:

Last Sunday, most eyes in the tennis world were on Madrid as Jack Draper and Casper Ruud faced off for the Masters 1000 trophy. But 4 May was also remarkable for being the final day of world No 1 Jannik Sinner's suspension. 

As of Sunday, he was officially allowed to play tennis again, over a year after two positive tests for clostebol set into motion one of the sport's most unedifying sagas of recent times.

Flo Clifford delves into Sinner's doping saga and his return to action:

Jannik Sinner has not been the only tennis star to be embroiled in a doping case as of late.

Australia's two-time Grand Slam doubles champion Max Purcell has accepted an 18-month ban after breaching anti-doping rules.

Purcell admitted to a breach of rules relating to the use of a "prohibited method" after unknowingly receiving an IV infusion of vitamins above the allowed limit of 100ml in a 12-hour span and entered into a provisional suspension in mid-December.

Jack Draper publicly backed Jannik Sinner as the Italian prepares to make his return from a three-month doping suspension, saying he “doesn't deserve any hate”.

“I think Jannik is a really, really genuine, nice person,” Draper, a personal friend of Sinner's, told The Guardian and BBC Sport ahead of his own return to action at the Madrid Open last month.

“And on top of that, he's obviously an unbelievable player. In this situation, I'm sure that he would have absolutely zero idea of anything. That's just the way life goes – sometimes there's mistakes.

“In terms of actually how I feel about him as a person, I think it's important for people to know and recognise that the guy's very, very kind-hearted and a good human being. So he doesn't deserve any of the hate that he gets.”

Serena Williams expressed surprise over the length of Jannik Sinner's ban from tennis, joking that she would have been stripped of her grand slam titles had she failed a drugs test.

“I love the guy, I love this game. He's great for the sport,” the 23-time grand slam champion said to Time magazine in praise of Sinner.

“I've been put down so much, I don't want to bring anyone down. Men's tennis needs him. [But] if I did that, I would have gotten 20 years. Let's be honest. I would have gotten grand slams taken away from me.”

Jannik Sinner revealed he considered quitting tennis before accepting a three-month doping ban.

The Italian was asked in an interview with state broadcaster RAI whether he considered giving up tennis and replied: “Yes, yes.

“I remember before the Australian Open this year, I was not in a very happy moment because there was still that case of doping.

“I didn't feel comfortable and then I said, maybe after Australia, a little bit of free time, in the sense where I take a little break it will do me good.” 

Emma Raducanu and Jack Draper coasted into Italian Open third round yesterday, with both storming to straight-sets victories over Jil Teichmann and Luciano Darderi respectively.

There was no such luck for Cameron Norrie, however, who had no answers for 10th seed Daniil Medvedev as he was knocked out in the second round.

Jacob Fearnley, meanwhile, was knocked out by home favourite Matteo Berrettini this morning.

Jannik Sinner revealed he received some “surprising messages” from fellow players during his three-month doping ban, with the World No 1 also admitting he was surprised by the players who did not reach out.

“At the start of the suspension I received some surprising messages from some players,” Sinner said ahead of his return at the Italian Open.

“Whereas there were others who I would have expected to hear from that didn't send anything. But I'm not going to name names."

Jannik Sinner has not played since winning the Australian Open in January for his third grand slam title after the Italian reached a resolution agreement with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).

WADA were initially pushing for a ban of between one and two years at the Court of Arbitration for Sport after he twice tested positive for a banned substance in March last year. However, Sinner reached a settlement of three months, with a senior WADA figure insisting the World No 1's case was a “million miles away from doping”.

While Sinner admitted “partial responsibility” for the mistakes made by his team that led to him twice positive for traces of clostebol, WADA withdrew its appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) that asked for a ban of up to two years following the initial decision by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) not to suspend him. 

Jannik Sinner is on a 21-match winning run, with his last defeat coming to Carlos Alcaraz in the China Open final last season.

Should Sinner progress past Navone, he could potentially face Spain's Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in the third round and Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo in round four. Cerundolo defeated Sinner at the Italian Open in 2023.

His projected quarter-final opponent is Madrid Open champion and two-time French Open runner-up Casper Ruud while Sinner is in a different half of the draw to Alcaraz, who is seeded third, behind World No 2 Alexander Zverev.

Will the early exits go on to impact any of their Roland Garros seedings?ByTENNIS.comPublished May 11, 2025 copy_link

Three of the four highest-ranked U.S. men fell in their opening matches at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia on Saturday, including world No. 4 Taylor Fritz.A quarterfinalist in Rome a year earlier, Fritz was ousted by countryman Marcos Giron. The 31-year-old prevailed, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (3), despite trailing 4-0 in the second set. For Giron, it marked his second Top 5 victory this season (d. No. 5 Ruud in Indian Wells second round) and first Top 10 win on clay.Fritz, whose European clay swing was delayed until Madrid due an abdominal issue that has plagued him intermittently this season, dropped to 16-8 on the year. An in-form Jack Draper can now overtake the 2024 US Open finalist for the No. 4 seed at Roland Garros by reaching the semifinals here, while Madrid champion Casper Ruud can do the same with another title run. Fritz is due to play the Geneva Open before making his way to the French capital.

Ben Shelton is also in jeopardy of having his seeding notably impacted following his loss to Jaume Munar. The Spainard got the better of the left-hander for the second time in 2025 (Dallas second round), much more convincingly on this occasion with his 6-2, 6-1 dismissal.Munar broke five times while holding in every service game to book a third-round encounter with Sebastian Korda. The No. 22 seed beat Aleksandar Vukic, 6-3, 6-4.Shelton currently sits at No. 12 in the ATP's live rankings, but the likes of Tommy Paul, Arthur Fils and Francisco Cerundolo can bump him down to the Paris major's 13-16 seed group. The 22-year-old has lost three of four matches since reaching the BMW Open final in Munich.

Frances Tiafoe was eliminated by Sebastian Ofner. The 143rd-ranked qualifier pulled out a 6-2, 6-7 (2), 6-3 win and gets Cerundolo for a fourth-round spot. Tiafoe—ranked No. 15 coming in—has one final chance to pick up matches ahead of Roland Garros, having entered the 500-level event in Hamburg.As for Paul, his day went according to plan. The No. 11 seed swept past Roberto Bautista Agut, 6-1, 6-4, and awaits 19th-seeded Tomas Machac.

Before each day's play at the Foro Italico, we'll preview three must-see matches.BySteve TignorPublished May 11, 2025 copy_link

Published May 11, 2025

This match comes with a strong sense of déja vu. In 2023, Sabalenka won Madrid and arrived in Rome as the WTA's player of the moment. Then she faced Kenin in the second round, and promptly went down to defeat in straight sets. That day, she looked less than fully ready to compete, and Kenin was steady enough to make her pay for it.Two years later, Sabalenka again comes to Rome with a Madrid title in her pocket, as well as the No. 1 ranking. This time, she looked fully prepared for her opening match, which she won 6-2, 6-2 over Anastasia Potapova. After Kenin's ambush of 2023, Sabalenka should be prepared for the American this time as well.Sabalenka leads their head-to-head 3-1, but none of her wins came on clay. Kenin is also a better player than she wa at this time two years ago; she's up to No. 31, and is coming off a runner-up run on green clay in Charleston. All of which will make this an interesting test of how far Sabalenka has come a a player and a professional since 2023. Winner: Sabalenka

The Frenchman and the Greek may be two ships passing in the rankings night. Fils is at a career-high No. 14; that's five spots ahead of Tsitsipas, who not long ago was a perennial Top Tenner and Grand Slam contender.Has the 20-year-old Fils passed the 26-year-old Tsitsipas for good? He already has a 2-0 record against him in completed matches, and his confidence has risen during this clay season. Tsitsipas, meanwhile, took a step back when he lost in the quarters in Monte Carlo, after winning the title there three of the past four years.Fils has the pace from both sides to take advantage of Tsitsipas's weaker one-handed backhand, and he's a match for him when it comes to all-court athleticism. But all may not be lost for Tsitsipas just yet. His 2025 record is the same as Fils's (17-9); he has been a finalist in Rome; and his two losses to Fils came on indoor hard courts, not clay. This is still his best surface. Fils is trying to make it his before Roland Garros. Winner: Tsitsipas

By defeating Vekic, Andreescu won back-to-back matches at a WTA 1000 for the first time since 2023 (Miami Open, 4R).

You remember Bianca, right? US Open champion, conqueror of Serena Williams, Top 5 player, pride of Canada, “She the North”? It all seems so long, and so many injuries, ago.Now Andreescu has returned from her latest physical issue—an appendectomy that forced her to delay the start of her 2025 season. She's just 3-3 on the year, and is ranked 121st, but she does have a couple of decent wins already, over McCartney Kessler in Madrid and Donna Vekic in Rome. More important for the long run, she's still just 24.For the second straight week, she has run into Rybakina. The one-time Wimbledon champ has mostly been a non-factor this season, but she did win this tournament in 2023, and she just beat Andreescu 6-3, 6-2 in Madrid. Let's see how far Andreescu has come, and how far she still has to go, before the Slams begin. Winner: Rybakina

Mr Bates vs The Post Office and Mr Loverman were the big victors at the BAFTA TV Awards, meaning Baby Reindeer did not continue its dominant winning streak.


	Hosted by The Traitors star Alan Cumming, the BAFTA ceremony took place in sparkling spring sunshine on the banks of the River Thames at London's Royal Festival Hall on Sunday. 


	The prizes were fairly evenly shared, but perhaps unsurprisingly, it was a notable night for Mr Bates vs The Post Office, the ITV series that dominated the UK ratings last year and fuelled a national conversation about injustices faced by innocent British postmasters, who were convicted of theft, fraud, and false accounting.

	The series won Best Limited Drama, beating Baby Reindeer, which has been a darling of the awards season after cleaning up at the Emmys and Golden Globes. Jessica Gunning did, however, take home the prize for Best Supporting Actress for Baby Reindeer, completing a likely historic TV Awards sweep.

	ITV also won the Special Award for commissioning Mr Bates vs The Post Office, with content chief Kevin Lygo accepting the prize. He used his speech to make the case for British storytelling amid concerns that a funding crisis will prevent series like Mr Bates from being made in the future. “It falls to us to remember that these are incredibly important stories,” he told a room full of British TV grandees. Mr Bates screened on PBS Masterpiece in the U.S.


	Lennie James took home Best Leading Actor in a highly competitive category. His prize for Mr Loverman, the BBC adaptation of Bernardine Evaristo‘s seventh novel, meant the likes of Richard Gadd and Gary Oldman missed out. Ariyon Bakare won Best Supporting Actor for his turn in Mr Loverman. The series does not currently have a home in the U.S.


	Marisa Abela won Best Leading Actress for HBO/BBC series Industry. In an emotional speech, she thanked Mickey Down and Konrad Kay for changing her life.


Shōgun continued its awards streak, picking up Best International series. Showrunner Justin Marks appeared to reference Donald Trump‘s tariff plan in his acceptance speech, saying “good television is truly a borderless nation.”


	Danny Dyer was the popular winner of Best Male Performance In A Comedy. The former Football Factory actor has garnered plaudits for his work in Disney+ series Rivals, but took home the BAFTA prize for Sky's Mr Big Stuff. “What a touch,” he said as he picked up his mask, before joking: “Acting so bad it's funny.”

	











	Ruth Jones won Best Female Performance In A Comedy after the wildly popular festive finale of Gavin & Stacey. She thanked her co-writer and co-star James Corden, with whom she has shared an “astonishing journey” on the BBC series over the past 17 years.


Ukraine: Enemy In The Woods secured the prize for Best Single Documentary, a moment that will have raised a few eyebrows in the room. Producer HOYO Films stirred controversy with its recent film Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone, which is currently the subject of a BBC investigation after being narrated by the son of a Hamas official. “We hope to continue to make many more documentaries like this — it's what we live for,” said HOYO founder Jamie Roberts.


	In one of the more political moments of the night, Marcel Mettelsiefen used his Best Current Affairs win for State Of Rage to describe the situation in Gaza as “collective punishment.” “This violence needs to stop now,” he added. “Let's break this silence.”


	Elsewhere, Kirsty Wark, the former BBC Newsnight presenter, received the BAFTA Fellowship, the British Academy's top accolade. The BBC's coverage of Glastonbury Festival won its first BAFTA for 30 years, clinching Best Live Event Coverage.


	BAFTA handed out television prizes for its Craft Awards last month, during which winners included Baby Reindeer creator Gadd, who took home the award for Writer: Drama.

A benefit of being Tom Cruise must be that whenever he wants something to happen, he's probably able to make it happen. Even when it came to offering casting suggestions to a notoriously finicky director like Stanley Kubrick, Cruise managed to get his way, convincing the “Eyes Wide Shut” filmmaker to bring then-wife Nicole Kidman into the project. Speaking for an interview featured in the June issue of Sight and Sound (per The Independent), the “Mission: Impossible” star recalled traveling to England to meet Kubrick for the first time and pitching Kidman for “Eyes Wide Shut” then and there.

 










“I flew out to his house and I landed in his backyard. I read the script the day before and we spent the day talking about it. I knew all of his films,” Cruise said. “Then it was basically he and I getting to know each other. And when we were doing that, I suggested Nicole play the role [of Alice]. Because obviously she's a great actress.”

As on most of his films, Cruise's mindset working with Kubrick was “whatever it's going to take we're going to do this.” The actor said he felt that way even after a shoot that was supposed to last “three or four months” ballooned to a year-plus due to reshoots and Kubrick's obsessive attention to detail. Looking back on the work today, Cruise said he valued it for the lessons he learned and how unique the film continues to be.

“I thought the film was very interesting, and I wanted to have that experience,” he said. “When I go to make a movie, I do a lot of detailed investigation and a lot of time with the people before I commit so that I understand what they need and want and they understand me and how we can work together and really create something very special.”

In an interview with the Los Angeles Times last summer, Kidman also reminisced on her work in “Eyes Wide Shut,” having her own reasoning for why Kubrick brought her onto the project. She believed it was her “boldness” that made her the right fit for Alice: the wife to Cruise's New York doctor, both of whom arrive in the film under-stimulated by their somewhat tepid marriage.

“I suppose that was why he cast me. That mischief, that provocative nature, he found that out and it got more imbued into Alice,” said Kidman to the LA Times. “The scene where I drop the dress … that was me. That wasn't written. That was my dress from my closet. ‘This is how I take off the dress, Stanley.' Because I had a lot of clothes, we weren't paying to buy clothes. And Stanley had come over and I was showing him all these beautiful dresses. That's how that happened.”

International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor


Refresh for latest…: Marvel Studios/Disney's Thunderbolts* has reached $272.2M worldwide in its sophomore session. The current international box office cume is $143.7M after this frame added $34M overseas. The latter reps a 52% drop (-50% excluding China). The New Avengers continue to reap great social scores and are on their way to $300M global by the end of the week. The ragtag ensemble was the top studio title in most offshore markets this weekend.


	Before we dive into more detail on Thunderbolts* second go-round, let's dig into some new milestones for Warner Bros/Legendary's A Minecraft Movie. The Jack Black/Jason Momoa-starrer topped the nine-century mark globally in its sixth weekend with $909.6M through Sunday. It also passed half a billion internationally, now at $500.6M. More detail below.

	Turning back to Thunderbolts*, it was the top MPA picture in most of Europe. Across Asia, it was No. 1 for the studios save in Japan, and in Latin America it held the No. 1 slot for a studio movie except for Mexico (where Sony's Karate Kid: Legends was No. 1 in its early opening) and Peru.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The antihero pic from director Jake Schreier is already the No. 2 studio title of the year in Hong Kong, Indonesia, India and Thailand.


	Some of the strongest holds this weekend include in Ukraine (-21%), Poland (-24%), Denmark (-26%), Sweden (-28%), Spain (-31%), France (-31%), Australia (-34%), Germany (-37%) and Hong Kong (-37%). 


	When looking at just the FSS weekend (given last frame included the May 1 holiday in many markets), a 44% dip (excluding China) is stronger than Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (-52%), Captain America: Brave New World (-54%) and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (-54%).


	The Top 5 markets to date are: UK ($15.5M), China ($13.8M), Mexico ($11.2M), France ($7.2M) and Australia ($6.4M).


	The global Imax cume is $29M, including $15M from overseas.


	As for Minecraft, this weekend added $12.5M in 78 offshore markets, helping push the Chicken Jockey across a bunch of new records. It's now the biggest WB movie ever in Poland, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Lebanon and Turkey. Globally, Minecraft has exceeded such other WB titles as Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, The Chamber of Secrets, and The Prisoner of Azkaban, as well as Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice, Inception, the first Fantastic Beasts movie and The Crimes of Grindelwald, and Dune: Part Two.

	











	The Top 5 to date are: UK ($71.2M), Germany ($37M), Australia ($34.2M), Mexico ($32M) and China ($28.4M).


	As for Warner Bros and Ryan Coogler's Sinners, the Michael B. Jordan-starrer sunk its teeth into another $6.6M from 70 offshore markets, repping a solid 40% dip. Strong holds were seen in UAE (-16%), France (-24%), Australia (-26%), Spain (-29%), Saudi Arabia (-31%), Holland (-35%), Germany (-42%), UK (-41%), and Italy (-47%). 


	The overseas cume to date is $68.9M for $283.3M global through Sunday; it will cross $300M global, largely powered by domestic.


	In like-for-like international markets at today's rates, the film is tracking 119% over Speak No Evil, 90% higher than Nope, 61% ahead of Get Out, 39% bigger than Us and 33% above Creed.


	The Top 5 are UK ($17.4M), France ($8.1M), Australia ($5.5M), Mexico ($3.9M) and Germany ($3.1M).


	Getting out early in Latin America — ahead of much wider release later this month — Sony's Karate Kid: Legends kicked off with $5.7M from 12 markets in the region. That's higher than recent nostalgic action/adventure revisits like Sony's Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire (+32%), as well as Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves (+24%) at current exchange rates.   


	Powered by strong critical and audience reactions, Mexico took the No. 1 spot with $3M.Other notable openings include Brazil ($860K), Peru ($415K) and Argentina ($320K).  


	The next major market releases include the UK (May 28) and Germany (May 29). Domestic goes May 30, and international play continues in a staggered pattern through the summer.

	Dock workers and truckers who are out of work or worried about their jobs because China‘s trade with the U.S. is coming to a grinding halt “should be very optimistic and positive, because the president truthed it out,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday.

Lutnick on his message to dockworkers who are out of work: "You should be very optimistic and positive, because the president truthed it out, and I rely on the president." pic.twitter.com/motVoNZ6d0


	Since the punishing 145 percent tariffs on China's imports to the U.S. went into effect, ports on the West Coast have seen plummeting cargo volume. Trump has said that is “a good thing.”


	“That's good… That means we lose less money,” the president said last week in the Oval Office when a reporter asked about workers concerned that trade has sharply decreased. “When you say it slowed down, that's a good thing, not a bad thing,” Trump added.

Reporter: “The ports here in the U.S., the traffic has really slowed.”Trump: “That's good.”Reporter: “Now thousands of dock workers and truck drivers are worried about their jobs.”Trump: “…When you say it slowed down, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.” pic.twitter.com/hWd2xfZthJ


	Fewer shipments means less work for those who transport imported goods — like dockworkers and truck drivers. And they're already feeling the pinch.

	











	“Just today, we had some what north of 235 members who sought work but were not able to get it,” Sal DiContanza, port liaison for the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, told NBC Los Angeles on Friday. “It's beginning to manifest itself as a real loss of jobs and income from our members.”


	While Lutnick said these American workers should stay “optimistic,” he also said that they can expect the tariffs to stay into the “foreseeable future.”


	“We do expect a 10% baseline tariff to be in place for the foreseeable future — but don't buy the silly arguments that the U.S. consumer pays,” Lutnick said on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday. 


	When host Dana Bash told Lutnick “the cost of tariffs are paid by American consumers,” the secretary responded, “Well, I disagree with that, you know.”


	“Most economists, I would say, disagree with you on that,” Bash said. “And we have seen it being passed off time and time again to the American consumer.”


	Bash is right. Economists largely agree that tariffs are paid by American companies importing the goods to the U.S., and those companies typically pass on the added expense to consumers by raising prices.

	One study on the tariffs that Trump imposed during his first term found that U.S. consumers paid the cost of tariffs in the form of higher prices on washing machines, solar panels, aluminum, steel, and goods coming from China and the European Union. That caused a net loss of $114 billion for companies and consumers as well as a $16 billion loss to the U.S. economy. Another study by economists on Trump's first term tariffs concluded that “U.S. tariffs continue to be almost entirely borne by U.S. firms and consumers.”

	











	Already, consumers are seeing higher price tags on imported goods due to Trump's tariffs. But Trump administration officials have tried to paint a rosier picture like Lutnick or dodged questions about rising prices altogether. 


	Testifying to Congress last week, Rep. Mark Pocan asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who pays for tariffs. Bessent hemmed and hawed before saying the answer was “very complicated.”


	The U.S. and China are currently engaged in trade talks in Switzerland. Bessent said on Saturday night that there has been “substantial progress” in the talks, while Trump said that the two parties achieved a “total reset … in a friendly, but constructive, manner.” 


	As Rolling Stone reported, despite the administration's outward optimism, in private, Trump officials and others working in Republican politics have been stockpiling goods in anticipation of shortages.

	Economists have cautioned that an ongoing global trade war will slow global economic growth and could put the U.S. into a recession. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has warned that Trump's tariffs could cause increased inflation and rising unemployment.


	“The effects on inflation could be short-lived, reflecting a one-time shift in the price level. It is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent,” he said.

Earlier this week, an article published in the tech news outlet Futurism drew attention to a previously unidentified clause in SoundCloud's terms of use, which allows content uploaded to the site to be used as training data for AI.

The clause, which was added in February 2024 as part of the company's most recent terms update, reads, in part: “In the absence of a separate agreement that states otherwise, You [the user] explicitly agree that your Content may be used to inform, train, develop or serve as input to artificial intelligence or machine intelligence technologies or services as part of and for providing the services.”

In a statement since shared with Pitchfork, representatives for SoundCloud wrote that “SoundCloud has never used artist content to train AI models, nor do we develop AI tools or allow third parties to scrape or use SoundCloud content from our platform for AI training purposes.” They go on to describe other AI “use cases” including “personalized recommendations, content organization, fraud detection, and improvements to content identification,” as well as implementing “technical safeguards” against unauthorized data-scraping. Notably, the company does not directly address whether the music uploaded to its site will be used as AI training data in the future. Read their full statement below.

Over the past year and a half, SoundCloud has rolled out a suite of generative AI products designed to assist with music production and distribution. In 2022, the company announced that it would be laying off roughly 20% of its workforce due to recent economic changes. AI companies have been on the receiving end of several lawsuits this decade for infringing on copyrighted works in the training of their AI models.

Revisit Marc Hogan's column “Musicians Are Already Using AI More Often Than We Think” on the Pitch.

SoundCloud has always been and will remain artist-first. Our focus is on empowering artists with control, clarity, and meaningful opportunities to grow. We believe AI, when developed responsibly, can expand creative potential—especially when guided by principles of consent, attribution, and fair compensation.

SoundCloud has never used artist content to train AI models, nor do we develop AI tools or allow third parties to scrape or use SoundCloud content from our platform for AI training purposes. In fact, we implemented technical safeguards, including a “no AI” tag on our site to explicitly prohibit unauthorized use.

The February 2024 update to our Terms of Service was intended to clarify how content may interact with AI technologies within SoundCloud's own platform. Use cases include personalized recommendations, content organization, fraud detection, and improvements to content identification with the help of AI Technologies.

Any future application of AI at SoundCloud will be designed to support human artists, enhancing the tools, capabilities, reach and opportunities available to them on our platform. Examples include improving music recommendations, generating playlists, organizing content, and detecting fraudulent activity. These efforts are aligned with existing licensing agreements and ethical standards. Tools like Musiio are strictly used to power artist discovery and content organization, not to train generative AI models.

We understand the concerns raised and remain committed to open dialogue. Artists will continue to have control over their work, and we'll keep our community informed every step of the way as we explore innovation and apply AI technologies responsibly, especially as legal and commercial frameworks continue to evolve.

	With the animated revival of Everybody Hates Chris, Terry Crews hopes to be voicing patriarch Julius Rock for years to come.


	The Everybody Still Hates Chris star recently expressed hopes that the Comedy Central series will enjoy a “20-year longevity,” matching the likes of long-running animated shows like The Simpsons (1989-present) and Family Guy (1999-present).


	“To do it again animated, we can go forever,” said Crews in an interview. “That's the plan. Let's get some of that Family Guy, Simpsons kinda stuff. I want that 20-year longevity on that show.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	After Everybody Hates Chris ran for four seasons on UPN/The CW from 2005 to 2009, recounting Chris Rock‘s childhood as a skinny Black nerd from a working class family in 1980s Brooklyn, the comedian returned his narrator role with the animated revival that premiered in September.

	











	Crews and Tichina Arnold reprised their roles from the original series, voicing Chris' parents Julius and Rochelle Rock.


	The Emmy nominee added, “To do the live action and the bring it back as an animated show years later, it's a dream. I know the character inside out. Me and Tichina Arnold—she actually taught me how to act back when I was doing that show.”

"It's like a whole other job," she told the crowd at her Atlantic City show on May 9.

Kelly Clarkson is getting candid with fans about why she hasn't been hitting the road lately.


	During her concert in Atlantic City, N.J., on Friday (May 9), the 43-year-old pop star and TV personality told the crowd that touring isn't realistic right now due to the demanding schedule of The Kelly Clarkson Show.


	“We haven't done a show in a while, y'all, 'cause I have a talk show. It's like a whole other job,” Clarkson said, referencing her band, according to Page Six. The three-time Grammy winner also noted that being a single mother takes up much of her time.


	Still, Clarkson expressed gratitude for the opportunity to perform two nights at Atlantic City's Hard Rock Live at Etess Arena — her first live shows in nearly six months.

	











	“We are bummed 'cause we love doing shows, and it's hard to fit it in, so it's cool when it does work out with the schedule,” the American Idol alum told the audience. “And it's cool to get to see your faces and feed off y'all. Thank you so much for having so much energy.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	Her 90-minute set included fan-favorite hits such as “My Life Would Suck Without You,” “Because of You,” “Breakaway,” “Miss Independent,” “Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)” and “Since U Been Gone.” It marked her first full-length concert since November 2024.


	Clarkson hasn't embarked on a full tour since 2019. In the years since, she has booked Las Vegas residencies — including shows at PH Live at Planet Hollywood in 2023 and 2024. Earlier this year, she announced a new Vegas residency, Kelly Clarkson: Studio Sessions, at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace. The show opens July 4 and runs through July and August, with additional dates scheduled for November.


	In March, Clarkson celebrated the milestone 1,000th episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show. The daytime program, which launched in 2019, was renewed by NBC Owned Television Stations for a seventh season in December 2024. Her contract is set to expire next year, Page Six reports.


	The show has earned 22 Daytime Emmy Awards, including eight individual wins for Clarkson herself. Most recently, it won outstanding daytime talk series for the fourth consecutive year at the 2024 Daytime Emmys.


	Now in its sixth season, The Kelly Clarkson Show averages 1.2 million viewers per day and remains one of the top syndicated talk shows in the country, airing on more than 200 stations nationwide.

Business Editor


	The year has gotten off to a clamorous start for corporate America (not to mention the rest of us), with epic stock market gyrations and President Trump's chaotic tariff rollout ramping up the anxiety levels.


	Taking the stage against that backdrop this week in New York, major media companies will respond by doing what they do best: tuning out the noise and putting on a show.


	Monday marks the kickof to upfronts week, the annual ritual of programmers pitching ad buyers, although it has become a more concentrated affair for the cost-conscious industry. Calling it a “week” overstates things a bit, as this concentrated edition will see eight events in just three days.

	











	NBCUniversal, Fox, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and TelevisaUnivision (with Paramount still eschewing the big stage) will face stiff competition in the form of Amazon, Netflix and YouTube. The three tech giants will all take part in the main upfronts week in person for the second straight year.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“There is definitely a lot of excitement, and that comes with tremendous pressure, as well,” Mark Marshall, Chairman of Global Advertising and Partnerships at NBCU, tells Deadline. “But I have no doubt we are ready – we have been preparing for this year for a long time.”


	Donna Speciale, President of U.S. Advertising and Marketing at TelevisaUnivision, says the turmoil facing the ad business is nothing new.  “In moments of uncertainty – which we've all gotten used to – advertisers are focusing on what drives real impact. No one's stepping back from growth, especially when it comes to reaching audiences they can't find anywhere else. Flexibility is also key right now.”


	Disney is also prepping a sequel to last year's starry bash, which saw the likes of Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds and CEO Bob Iger grace the North Javits stage. Sales chief Rita Ferro declined to get specific, but she said, “You can expect a significant talent presence, which is fitting for our portfolio,” she said. 


	Movies, a big theme across the industry last year, are expected to once again play a central role in the week, highlighting the shift in movie consumption as the box office tries to battle back to pre-Covid levels. Ferro notes the important role features play on flagship streaming service Disney+.

	











	Disney's upfront, including the annual mini-roast of the industry by late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, will be preceded by an ESPN press event. The sports division's chairman, Jimmy Pitaro, is expected to reveal the name and price of ESPN's forthcoming stand-alone streaming outlet.


	Sports rights will connect streaming with traditional media, with teases of NFL games expected throughout the upfront ahead of the league's official 2025 schedule unveiling. YouTube is getting set to announce it will livestream a game from Brazil in September, according to multiple press reports in recent days. The continued health of live sports is perhaps the one leveling factor among the cohort of upfront sellers, as they are constituted quite differently in their general entertainment operations.


	The NBA's new contract will see WBD step aside and NBCU re-enter the scene for the first time in two-plus decades. Disney has re-upped, and Amazon now also has long-term rights. NBCU will extend its successful Sunday night NFL window with basketball, and Prime Video will do likewise with Thursdays. 


	“There's some uncertainty and discussions around the economy,” Danielle Carney, Amazon's Head of U.S. Video and Live Sports Sales, told Deadline in an interview. “It's paramount that we're helping [advertisers] drive performance. … Our ability to drive the scale and great IP like the NBA and the NFL and big tentpole moments like Black Friday and Christmas Day, and also use our strong [consumer] signals and tech and ad innovation, is really unmatched.” 


	Data aggregated in the Amazon marketing cloud, she added, “can very safely and cleanly help build out reporting to understand the customer's journey and path, on and off Amazon.” That capability “is really unique,” she said. “You definitely cannot do this in sports other places. And so that's why I call it the megaphone, Thursday Night Football, and the NBA will be as well.”


	When Prime Video started running ads on all film and episodic titles last year, it was accused by rivals of undercutting the market with aggressively low pricing. “I won't go into a pricing conversation,” Carney replied when asked about it by Deadline. “But I will tell you, it's all about the value proposition. I think coming out of Year 1 [in 2023], we've delivered great value for our customers.”


	Even though WBD is winding down its last year of NBA coverage after almost 40 years on Turner Sports, the company's new co-heads of sales, Ryan Gould and Robert “Bobby” Voltaggio, are upbeat about their hand.


	“Given the breadth and depth of our content portfolio and the interoperability of our leadership team,” Gould said in an interview, “we're not intimidated by, like, ‘Oh my God, we have to fill so many hours of content. There will be content there.” In terms of keeping advertisers in the fold, he added, “we're going into these [upfront] conversations pretty sober and practical. The NBA was a big revenue driver for us.” Even so, he added, “a high majority” of advertisers on NBA telecasts also spent money in other areas of the company.


	WBD is also “reframing” its sports portfolio, with a number of lower-profile rights packages (college sports, pro tennis, etc.) bringing less expensive programming that nonetheless appeals to advertisers. “The strategy has changed,” Gould affirmed. Former Turner Sports chief David Levy “used to brag that he only bought the best sports. But the viewing habits were way different back then.” Digital outlet Bleacher Report, to that end, has been a key ingredient for WBD across various corporate iterations over the past decade and will play a role again in this upfront cycle.

	











	In the sports realm, the NBCU upfront will extend the usual 12-month outlook well beyond that time horizon.


	Marshall, who will kick off the week at Radio City Music Hall by touting what he calls a “supersized experience” for upfront buyers. Highlights include BravoCon; the debut of the NBA this fall; the Milan Olympics and the Super Bowl next February; the North America-hosted World Cup on Telemundo this summer; and then NBC's 100th anniversary next November. “We are also preparing for the LA28 Olympic Games,” he said. “Those will be here before you know it and will bring the magic of the Olympics back to the United States for the first time in over a quarter century.”


	In the ad sales game, it never hurts to have something to look forward to, even if it's three years down the line.

Although spending time with their families at Disneyland was magical for the remaining season 23 “American Idol” contestants, several members of the top seven — especially those who are parents to young kids — have admitted on social media how stressed and tired they are heading into the Disney themed shows, airing live coast-to-coast on May 11 and 12, 2025. 

Shortly after the May 5 live show wrapped, the top seven contestants had to quickly finish packing so they could be transported that night to Disneyland, finalist Jamal Roberts shared in a brief post-show Facebook Live. 

Since their trip to Anaheim — about an hour's drive from the show's Red Studios in Hollywood —  he and others have expressed how stressful it's been to learn and rehearse multiple songs while also juggling the gift of spending family time at Disneyland. 

A post shared by Breanna Nix (@breannanixmusic)

The top 7 worked with guest mentor Lin-Manuel Miranda while at Disneyland, each choosing multiple songs from Disney's catalog. They'll each perform one song on the Mother's Day show, per ABC, and they must be prepared to sing two more the next night if they make it through to the top 5. 

The contestants got to spend time with their families in between filming at Disneyland on May 6 and 7, but were back in Hollywood on May 8, “hitting it hard” in the studio, 25-year-old Breanna Nix shared during an Instagram Live that day.

“I feel a little bit stressed, just to be honest with you guys,” she admitted after her Disneyland trip with husband Austin and their four-year-old son, Emerson. “Even though Disneyland was so fun, it took a couple days off (from rehearsals) and we have four songs to sing Sunday and Monday and then we have the finale, which is like, right after that. It's like seven songs that we have to learn.”

Even those who are eliminated will have be prepared to perform during the May 19 live finale. Many fan-favorite contestants are returning to Hollywood this week to rehearse for the show.  

Nix revealed that one of the Disney songs she had chosen to sing was also selected by two other contestants, so they had to do a drawing to decide which person would get to perform it — and she lost. 

“I had prepared that song, had it together, and now I have to sing a whole completely different song,” she said wide-eyed, “and the song I picked is actually very hard.” 

But Nix laughed about the mix-up, saying that she's just praying for the best. She also said her voice is “very tired” from a lack of sleep, noting that she'd had a total of six hours of sleep over the previous two nights.

Roberts also spent time this week juggling spending quality time with his two young daughters at Disneyland and preparing for the next shows, including learning new songs from a list that producers provide, he told WTOK on May 9. 

He explained, “If you're like me, a church kid, you're looking at that list like, ‘Okay what is this?' So I'm going through the list just listening to see which one will fit me, which one I can make my own. Most of the songs I've sung so far, I didn't know. I had to really just learn it, and that is stressful.” 

But the stress is far outweighed by the joy he's seen on his kids' faces, he told fans on Instagram. Sharing a photo of his daughters on the teacup ride, he wrote, “These girls are having the time of their life 😍😍. Thank you, World, and thank you, American Idol, for making my girls' dream come true. I can't even explain how making them smile makes me feel inside.” 

Thunderstorm Artis, whose wife Faith and their two young boys have frequently been in the “Idol” audience, told the Deseret News on May 10 that while balancing family life with the show, he's trying to stay grateful despite the stress of it all. 

“I'm blessed that I'm still here in the top seven, to be able to do this week after week, even though it's a lot of work,” he told the paper. “I have to remind myself that I get to do this. This is a blessing. I could be doing a million different things, but I get to stand on stage and do something I'm really passionate about in front of millions of people in the world that are invested in my journey.” 

The next rounds of “American Idol” air live coast-to-coast on May 11 and 12, starting at 8 p.m. Eastern time both nights.

Jessica Gunning keeps coming up gold.


	The British actress has completed what is likely to be a historic TV awards sweep by adding a BAFTA to her collection of prizes for her portrayal of Martha Scott in hit Netflix series Baby Reindeer.


	Gunning won Best Supporting Actress at the BAFTA TV Awards on Sunday, beating competition from five other nominees, including Baby Reindeer co-star Nava Mau.


	Accepting the award, Gunning said she was “so proud” to be part of the series. She also channeled her character Fiona Harvey to wish Richard Gadd happy birthday, exclaiming: “Happy birthday, nipple.”

	“I sometimes do this kind of cheesy thing where I look back on the younger me and moments in my life, and I imagine the kind of then me, seeing me now, and think, ‘little did we know',” she said.

	It marks a quadruplet of major wins, having previously clinched an Emmy, Golden Globe, and SAG award. This kind of sweep for one role in the same awards season is incredibly rare, if not unprecedented.


	Matthew Macfadyen won an Emmy, BAFTA, and Golden Globe for Season 4 of Succession, but missed out on an individual prize at SAG.


	Phoebe Waller-Bridge clinched all four for Fleabag, but across two seasons and in different awards seasons. Helen Mirren and Kate Winslet won Emmy, Golden Globe, and SAG awards for Elizabeth I and Mildred Pierce respectively, but both missed out on a BAFTA.


	Gunning has also picked up other prizes over the past year, including at the Critics' Choice Awards, Royal Television Society Awards, and the Broadcasting Press Guild Awards. The breakout year has led to her being picked up by UTA and being cast in Steven Soderbergh‘s comedy The Christophers.


Baby Reindeer was a huge success story for Netflix, with Gunning playing the unsettling former lawyer Martha, who stalks Donny Dunn, portrayed by creator Gadd. The series was billed as a “true story,” which landed Netflix with a lawsuit after Harvey, the real-life Martha, sued the streamer for defamation after she was identified as the character.

Walton Goggins is having a pretty phenomenal year. His much-talked about turn on “The White Lotus” has garnered him affection and disgust in equal measure, with many women around the world left wondering if they might've been the one to “fix him.” He also closed out a legendary four-season run as Baby Billy Freeman on “The Righteous Gemstones,” forever making “Teenjus” part of the common vernacular. Now, ahead of Emmy's voting commencing next month, Goggins took on the penultimate episode of “SNL 50,” a special moment for him considering it was the annual Mother's Day show as well.

 










To celebrate this, Goggins had his own mother join him on stage for a special dance. After explaining how she raised him as a single parent with the assistance of his aunts and other friends, Goggins honored his mother by offering his hand and bringing her up before the audience. Though their dance initially started out as traditional, Goggins and his mother proceeded to show off their Southern roots by kicking off a session of clogging. “Saturday Night Live” isn't typically given the chance to go too sentimental, but when it does, it always manages to remind us of how special the show can be for those able to be a part of it.

Goggins may have needed to rely on the cue cards for most of the night, but he certainly looked like he was having a lot of fun no matter what. Of the live sketches, the best one was the first, which takes the been-there-done-that set-up of the Continental Congress and turns it into a hilarious indictment against our Founding Fathers, who maybe should've been referred to as our Founding Bros. In the bit, Goggins plays an obstructor named Matt who feels the most important amendment next to our right to free speech should simply be “guns.” It's a little hard to laugh at considering how this choice by a small group of men hundreds of years ago continues to wreak havoc on our society, but Goggins and the “SNL” cast's willingness to go there and be as silly as possible in doing so did garner a chuckle or two. 

We love a weird bit and paired with featured player Jane Wickline's odd sensibility, this one might be the strangest we've seen in a while. It starts silly enough with Wickline finding a baby shoe in Central Park that leads her to launch into song. Her hope is to find the baby the shoe belongs to, but instead comes to find that its wearer is a fully-grown man with exceptionally tiny feet. Goggins nails the self-seriousness of this comic character and also gets a boost from best friend Sam Rockwell, who appears as a balloon-salesman with similarly tiny tootsies. 

 










Rumors are abound that this might be Mikey Day's last season at “SNL.” If so, he may be going out on top with one of the most laugh-out-loud moments on Weekend Update in recent memory. Brought on to discuss Trump's tariff chaos, Day is introduced as a “guy who just walked through a spider-web.” This soon comes to define his entire presence rather than the initial purpose of talking about current affairs. Day's physical comedy is on another level and even seemed to get away from the comedian as he was unable to fully remove the shirt he comes to try and rip off. 

Later in the night, we were treated to another Dan Bulla “Midnight Matinee,” which have been popping up frequently this season and always manage to make the mundane utterly unique. This time around, Bulla takes aim at the use of the squatty potty, with Andrew Dismukes playing a recently promoted employee who can't think about anything other than his boss and his wife shitting after seeing the appliance in their bathroom. As a squatty potty user, I feel attacked, but as a fan of “SNL,” I appreciate their ability to find humor in every detail of our existence.

EXCLUSIVE: The Crown star Jonathan Pryce has joked that he worries about being barred from America for voicing his full views on Donald Trump‘s vision to slap tariffs on foreign films.


	Speaking to Deadline's Baz Bamigboye on the BAFTA TV Awards red carpet, Pryce said he was planning to visit New York in the coming weeks and did not wish to say “too much” about tariffs.


	“I want to get in easily, I don't want to be sent back,” he laughed. Pryce continued: “The frustrating thing about the tariffs is he [Trump] announces it, panics everybody by not telling them the details. So you've got people in Cannes now trying to do deals and it's going to be impossible until he says exactly what it is and how he is going to police it.”

‘Slow Horses' star and BAFTA TV Supporting Actor nominee Jonathan Pryce on Donald Trump's film tariffs and their effects on the Cannes market: “The frustrating thing about the tariffs is he announces it and panics everybody by not telling them the details” pic.twitter.com/QeBmL9Vk8j


	The Welsh actor was nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the BAFTA TV Awards for his role as David Cartwright in Slow Horses. He said Slow Horses‘ success has been a slow-burner because Apple TV+ did not overpublicize the series and allowed audiences to discover it for themselves.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Trump has made clear that his shock plans to slap a 100% tariff on film imports would not be included in a trade deal with the UK, where Pryce films Slow Horses. 


	The UK would be particularly vulnerable to any movie tariff, given that the country has established itself as one of Hollywood's top destinations for offshoring shoots, thanks to tax incentives, a skilled workforce, and a shared language.


	Trump's bombshell announcement came in a Truth Social post last weekend, telling followers he planned to apply a tariff to “any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign lands.” The president later said he did not intend to “hurt” the entertainment industry, adding that he intended to meet with studio chiefs to “make sure they're happy.”


	Jon Voight, the Oscar-winner and special ambassador to Hollywood, presented his plan to “make Hollywood great again” to Trump. Deadline got hold of Voight's proposal document, which states that if a U.S.-based production “could have been produced in the U.S., but the producer elects to produce in a foreign country and receives a production tax incentive therefor, a tariff will be placed on that production equal to 120% of the value of the foreign incentive received.”

With no new nationwide event pic on the marquee, Marvel Studios' ensemble superhero pic easily stayed No. 1 in its second weekend. 'Friendship' makes plenty of pals at the specialty box office.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Marvel Studios' Thunderbolts* lorded over a relatively quiet weekend at the domestic box office, earning $33.1 million for a 10-day North American tally of $128.5 million and $272.2 million globally.


	The ensemble pic led by Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan fell a respectable 55 percent from its opening weekend, compared to an average decline of 57 percent for a title in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and far less that more recent MCU films. Earlier this year, Captain America: Brave New World tumbled more than 65 percent.




Thunderbolts*  boasts both enviable reviews and audience scores, which is sparking strong word-or-mouth. And in a savvy stunt to whip up additional interest, Disney's marketers revealed after the movie opened that the asterisk refers to the unofficial title The New Avengers, since many of the characters will appear in next year's Avengers: Doomsday.

	Directed by Jake Schreier, the film brings together a band of dysfunctional outsiders — and lesser-known comic book characters — who discover their potential to be heroes when working together. In addition to Pugh (Yelena Belova) and Stan (Bucky Barnes), the movie features Wyatt Russell (John Walker), David Harbour (Alexei Shostakov/Red Guardian), Lewis Pullman (Bob), Hannah John-Kamen (Ghost), Olga Kurylenko (Taskmaster) and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (CIA director Valentine Allegra de Fontaine).


	With no new event pic on the marquee, the weekend belonged to holdovers all the way around. 


Warner Bros. had plenty to celebrate as Ryan Coogler's sleeper hit Sinners crossed the $200 million mark at the domestic box office for a worldwide total of nearly $300 million. In a second victory, A Minecraft Movie zoomed past $900 million in global ticket sales.


Sinners came in second in its fourth weekend with a huge $21.1 million for a North American total of $214.9 million through Sunday and $283.3 million globally. The supernatural vampire pic starring Michael B. Jordan is another coup for Coolger, the bold and audacious filmmaker behind the Black Panther and Creed franchises. (Jordan has starred in all five of his movies.)


A Minecraft Movie — the second-top-grossing video adaptation of all time behind Universal's The Super Mario Bros. Movie, not adjusted for inflation — placed third in its sixth weekend with $8 million for a domestic haul of $409 million and $909.6 million globally.

	











	Amazon MGM Studios' The Accountant 2, now in its fourth weekend, enjoyed a fourth-place finish with $6.1 million for a solid domestic total of $50.9 million. 


	Among a handful of smaller titles hoping to drum up business on a nationwide basis, IFC's slasher pic Clown in the Cornfield fared the best in opening to $3.7 million, enough to round out the top five. Lionsgate's Shadow Force and Vertical's Fight or Flight both opened in the $2 million range (the order will be determined Monday morning when final weekend grosses are tallied.)


	“This relatively quiet weekend is just the calm before the proverbial storm,” says Comscore chief box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian in referencing such upcoming May titles as Final Destination: Bloodlines, Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning, Lilo & Stitch and Karate Kid: Legends. He adds, “It's looking like it's going to be an epic month of May for movie theaters.”


	There was action at the specialty box office, thanks to A24's critically acclaimed Friendship, which opened in six cinemas. The Tim Robinson-Paul Rudd bromance scored a dazzling per theater average of $75,137, which A24 says is the best showing of the year so far for an indie title opening in platform run.

	The Trump administration is getting ready to accept a super luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from the royal family of Qatar to replace Air Force One until Donald Trump‘s second term ends, when ownership of the plane will be shifted to his presidential library foundation, ABC News reported, citing sources familiar with the agreement.


	Trump is scheduled to visit Qatar next week where the gifted plane — which has been described as “a flying palace” worth $400 million — is anticipated to be announced. If the deal goes through, it would be the most expensive gift ever offered to the United States by a foreign government. Trump personally toured the plane in February when it was at West Palm Beach International Airport.


	Reacting to the news, Sen. Chris Murphy posted on social media: “This isn't a good idea even if the plane was being donated to the U.S. government. But Trump GETS TO KEEP THE PLANE??? It's simply a cash payment to Trump in exchange for favors. Just wildly illegal.”

	











	The emoluments clause of the Constitution bars federal officeholders from “accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State” without approval from Congress. But administration lawyers have given the gift the green light.

	Per ABC News' sources, Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House Counsel David Warrington determined it is “legally permissible” because the plane will be given on the terms that its ownership will transfer to Trump's presidential library before he leaves office. The idea, however, that it's not Trump's per se seems to be lost on the president. According to a source familiar with the matter, Trump privately refers to the likely gift from the Qatari government as “one of my new big, beautiful planes.”


	The 13-year-old plane will first be given to the U.S. Air Force, which will cover the costs of updating the plane to meet U.S. military specifications necessary to transport the president, ABC News sources familiar with the anticipated arrangement.

	Government lawyers in the White House and Department of Justice decided that the present does not amount to bribery because it is not being gifted on the condition of an official act. Bondi additionally decided that the gift is not bribery because the plane is being given to the Air Force and then to Trump's presidential library rather than to Trump himself.

	











	One reason Trump would want a new aircraft from Qatar is that plans to build a new fleet of Air Force One planes have been delayed and over budget on a $3.9 billion contract. Although a contract was signed with Boeing in 2018 — during Trump's first administration — to build the new fleet, the planes were not expected to be ready to use until 2029, after Trump's second term expires. Trump has asked Elon Musk to help expedite the process.


	While Musk's efforts have moved the delivery date up by two years, Trump is antsy to enjoy a luxurious new Air Force One sometime this year. Enter the Qatari royal family and their “palace in the sky.”


	Concerns about accepting the plane from Qatar include the security ramifications of accepting such a present — one that will not only transport the president but also host sensitive and classified conversations — from a foreign government. The gifted plane also may not be able to perform at the same level as the current Air Force One jets, and the short timeline won't allow for performance modifications.

	“You could do some paint, you could do some communications upgrades, and I suspect it would be hard to do too much beyond that on that timeline,” Andrew Hunter, the Air Force's acquisition under Biden, told The Wall Street Journal earlier this month.


	The Trumps seem to be fostering a close relationship with the Qatari government and royal family. Late last month, the Trump Organization announced it has agreed to build a new Middle East golf course in Qatar in partnership with Qatari Diar, a real estate company created by the nation's sovereign wealth fund. The chair of Qatari Diar is a minister in the government of Qatar.

	In March 2019, a then-Fox News host was sitting quietly, scanning the news, when suddenly their phone rang. They were told to “hold for the president” of the United States, Donald Trump. This Fox host — in an account relayed to Rolling Stone by a person with direct knowledge of the matter — did not know why they were getting this call. They did not have an interview scheduled with Trump. They hadn't requested an off-the-record chat that week. 


	“What could this be about?” the host privately wondered. 


	Within seconds, Trump was on the line, launching into what this source describes as a minutes-long, profanity-laced tirade about how the network's executives were being too “politically correct” and that “liberal” network figures like Rupert Murdoch's children (to be clear, the media mogul's heir, Lachlan Murdoch, is a conservative) were doing a “fucking terrible thing” that needed to be reversed at once. 


	The sitting president — who presumably had other pressing matters to attend to at the time —  encouraged the host, and others, to agitate internally at the right-wing cable news giant to help ensure that this supposed problem be remedied quickly, and to send a message to the Murdoch family. The president, according to the source, was “really worked up” about it.

	











	In the middle of his first presidency, the leader of the free world had carved out time in his schedule so that he could personally call around to Fox News personnel and talent and lobby them to raise hell at the network about the perceived mistreatment of on-air personality “Judge Jeanine” Pirro, a former district attorney, longtime Trump pal, and leading MAGA evangelist. The president was upset about news that Pirro had been quietly suspended by Fox News brass after she had made anti-Muslim comments on-air about Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). 


	And he was doing his part to mount a pressure campaign to run interference for his close friend and political ally, no matter her words or deeds, no matter the level of bigotry.

	“I learned something, which was: Donald Trump will always protect Judge Jeanine,” the source says.


	It wouldn't take long for the suits bring Pirro back to the Fox News airwaves, where she has spent the last six years providing some of her network's most fervently pro-Trump propaganda — including when she helped push lies about the 2020 election in the weeks leading up to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot that Trump instigated. In the days before Trump left office, Pirro lobbied the president to grant a last-minute pardon to her ex-husband, who had been convicted of conspiracy and tax evasion. Trump obliged her as one of his final acts.

	











	Trump, now the president for a second time following the Joe Biden interregnum, never stopped listening to Pirro. He wasn't just an avid viewer of her shows. He regularly talked to her on the phone and invited her for closed-door meetings — both while in and out of office — often to solicit advice on policy and personnel matters, according to current and former Trump administration officials. She almost got a high-ranking job in his first Justice Department during his first administration, while lobbying to become the attorney general. As recently as last year, according to one 2024 Trump campaign official, Trump had privately lamented how some “bad people” who had worked for him as aides managed to talk him out of appointing Pirro during his initial four years in the White House. 


	But last week, Trump once again swooped in to help out his friend “Judge Jeanine” — not simply to get her back on the air at Fox News, but to give her the kind of job he has wanted to give her for nearly a decade now. “I am pleased to announce that Judge Jeanine Pirro will be appointed interim United States Attorney for the District of Columbia,” Trump wrote Thursday night on Truth Social, hours after he said he was removing loyalist Ed Martin from the role, amid a firestorm of Nazi-related controversy.

	Trump had been lobbying senators to confirm Martin to the role permanently. After one Republican senator publicly balked, he moved on to Pirro, while installing Martin as the director of the ominously titled “Weaponization Working Group,” as well as associate deputy attorney general and pardon attorney. 


	“In addition to her Legal career, Jeanine previously hosted her own Fox News Show, Justice with Judge Jeanine, for ten years, and is currently Co-Host of The Five, one of the Highest Rated Shows on Television,” Trump wrote in announcing Pirro as Martin's replacement, adding that she is “incredibly well-qualified for the position.”


	Martin used his short time as D.C.'s top prosecutor to carry out the president's vendettas, and even referred to himself as “President Trump's lawyer.” Pirro figures to pick up where Martin left off — and then some.


	“She's there to crack skulls,” says a person close to Trump who recently discussed Pirro and the Justice Department with the president, explaining why Trump wanted her as his new top federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C. 


	In his 2024 campaign and during the opening months of his second presidency, Trump has made clear that the key priority of his new administration is to carry out retribution campaigns against his political enemies, including by using the Department of Justice and other agencies as a cudgel against those who cross him. 

	











	For years, Pirro has been publicly calling for the eradication of anti-Trump subversives, real or imagined.

	“There is a cleansing needed in our FBI and Department of Justice,” Pirro said on Fox News all the way back in December 2017. “It needs to be cleansed of individuals who should not just be fired, but who need to be taken out in handcuffs.”


	Now that Trump has installed her at the top of the D.C. attorney's office, Pirro will have the power to see that handcuffs are applied around the wrists of the president's enemies, rather simply crowing about it on cable news.

							By 

	Andrew Perez



	Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) traveled to Pennsylvania for a town hall on Saturday to offer Democrats advice on how to build a bigger tent — and perhaps to drum up support for a potential 2028 presidential bid. 


	When an attendee asked Gallego about a fundraiser he held with Marc Andreessen, a billionaire crypto investor and close ally of Donald Trump, the freshman senator stayed on message — framing it as an example of how Democrats should bring more people in the tent. (The fundraiser was first reported by Rolling Stone.)


	“My general view of how to win elections is you have to get a lot of votes, and that means we're going to have to have alliances with people that we may not agree with 100 percent of the time,” said Gallego, stating that “Marc Andreessen runs the largest venture capital firm in Arizona. We want to bring as many jobs as possible.”


	Gallego said he doesn't agree with Andreessen on every issue, pointing to the existence of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which the VC exec accused of “terrorizing financial institutions” after it fined a payday lending company backed by his firm. 

	











	But Gallego added, “My perspective [is] what happened last election is that we got so pure and we kept so pure that we started kicking you out of the tent. It ends up there aren't enough people in the tent to win elections.” 


	Gallego held a $5,000-per-ticket fundraising retreat for his leadership PAC in March, with Andreessen listed as a featured guest speaker. Political blogger Matt Yglesias was also slated to speak at the event, held at the luxury resort L'Auberge de Sedona. 


	The event took place months after Gallego was made the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee's new subcommittee on “digital assets,” created to oversee cryptocurrencies. 


	Andreessen, who advised Trump as he assembled his outwardly pro-crypto administration, and his firm — Andreessen Horowitz — have invested in crypto for years. The firm lobbies extensively on crypto issues.

	Andreessen, the firm, and co-founder Ben Horowitz donated more than $100 million last election cycle to a pro-crypto Super PAC, Fairshake, and its subsidiary Protect Progress. The latter Super PAC spent $10 million boosting Gallego's 2024 Senate campaign.

	











	Andreessen Horowitz has been lobbying on legislation called the GENIUS Act, which would create a new, weak regulatory framework for so-called stablecoins, or crypto assets pegged to actual currencies, like the U.S. dollar. Experts say the legislation would effectively allow Big Tech firms like Amazon, Meta, or X to create their own digital currencies. (Andreessen Horowitz has invested in X, formerly known as Twitter.)

	The GENIUS Act has become more controversial due to the last development in the Trump family's wildly corrupt crypto dealings. Reuters recently reported that a state-backed fund in the United Arab Emirates is making a $2 billion investment using a stablecoin from the Trump family's crypto exchange. 


	Gallego is one of several crypto-friendly Democrats who helped stop the GENIUS Act from advancing in the Senate last week. According to reporting from the American Prospect, it's widely expected these Democrats will ultimately support the legislation.

Mick Jagger's fiancee Melanie Hamrick has opened up to Us Weekly about their relationship and why she wants to keep it private.

“I think family is so personal, and it's a bubble,” Hamrick, 37, told the publication on May 8, at the NYC Ballet Spring Gala at the David H. Koch Theater in New York City

“It's nice to share things, but it's like the ballet: there needs to be a mystery or people are going to get sick of you,” she confided to Us Weekly.

To Page Six, she gushed, “He's amazing, he really is,” and she joked about the couple's 44-year age gap, saying, “He's younger than me.”

According to Us Weekly, Hamrick is a former ballet dancer. Asked what she wants to keep the most mysterious, she responded, “My private life.”

“I love the Kardashians, however I'm not as comfortable in public,” she continued to the magazine.

Paris Match reported in April that Hamrick “now devotes herself to her son, Deveraux, born in 2016” to her and Jagger.

Hamrick has provided details about her relationship with Jagger in some interviews, though.

According to Paris Match, Hamrick and Jagger have been together for almost 11 years.

She revealed that Jagger had proposed to her several years before the April 2025 interview.

“Maybe one day we'll marry, maybe not,” Hamrick told Paris Match. “We are so happy in our current life that I would be too afraid to change anything.”

According to Us Weekly, Jagger and Hamrick “met in 2014 after a Rolling Stones concert in Tokyo after” after she attended with members of the American Ballet Theatre with complimentary tickets.

Jagger is 44 years older than Hamrick, according to Us Weekly. 

She addressed the age gap to The Sunday Times, saying, “If you think about others' opinions, no matter where you are in life, you're going to have a problem and you're going to analyze it. I put the blinders on. Am I happy? Yes. Are the people in my life happy? Yes. Am I hurting anyone? No. OK, they can mind their own business.”

According to Page Six, Hamrick is no longer performing as a ballerina and is writing novels instead.

Rivals actor Danny Dyer says the death of his mentor and champion, Nobel prize-winning playwright Harold Pinter, caused him to suffer a “spiral of madness.”


	Dyer, a longtime familiar face on British TV and film and freshly appreciated for his role in Disney's Rivals, told the BBC's Desert Island Discs radio show that he hadn't spoken to Pinter in a while when he learnt of his death from a newspaper:


	“I did go off the rails for many years and I found out by looking on the front of a newspaper.


	“I'd been on a bender and I was coming home and I was going, I think I was going to buy cigarettes at the petrol garage, and I see it in the paper: ‘Pinter dead'.

	“This really sent me on a spiral of madness, really. The guilt of not being around him any more and just being lost, I was a bit of a lost soul, and again, angry at the world.”


	Dyer added that Pinter had been one of his greatest supporters when he was starting out on his acting career. Dyer even stayed at the older man's home when performing in one of his plays, Celebration, in 2000, and had proved a support when Dyer suffered stagefright and forgot his lines.


	Dyer said of Pinter: “He put his arm around me, and made me feel better about it.”


	In April, Deadline reported that Dyer was developing an idea for a play about his relationship with Pinter, whom he referred to as his “mentor.”

Saturday Night Live‘s Weekend Update addressed the election of Robert Prevost as the first American pope, and the subsequent complaints from some conservatives that the Chicago native is somehow “woke.”


Colin Jost began by admitting that, as a Catholic, he “could not be more proud.” 


	“Which is a sin, and now I'm ashamed,” he joked.“The Vatican has selected Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost from the south side of Chicago to be the new pope,” Jost continued, as a photograph showed on screen of Pope Leo XIV waving at the crowd in St. Peter's Square after his ascension Thursday. “You can tell he's from the south side because he's got his hands up.”Jost later turned to MAGA sphere complaints about the new pope having criticized Donald Trump, JD Vance, and the administration's hardline immigration approach.


	“I also love that conservatives are already complaining that this pope is too woke. How woke can a 69-year-old man from Chicago be?” he said. “It's not like he came out and was like, ‘Hey, I'm Pope Leo XIV, he/him.'”


	“The reality is there are no woke catholics,” Jost added. “If you're a woke Catholic, you're just not Catholic anymore.”


	Later in the segment, co-anchor Michael Che riffed on Donald Trump wanting to reopen the federal penitentiary on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay in order to “house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders.”

	Former Saturday Night Live cast member Cecily Strong revived her portrayal of Jeanine Pirro alongside Colin Jost as Pete Hegseth, and the pair of “old drinking buddies” celebrated their reunion.


	The duo, called the “AA team” by Donald Trump (James Austin Johnson), were glad to link up again after their stints at Fox News.


	“I'm so proud to be part of this group full of Russian assets, booze hounds, and people famous for the little baby animals they've killed,” said Pirro, whom Trump had named interim attorney for the District of Columbia.


	Trump said Pirro had the most important quality to him: “she's on TV!”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“I love hiring people from Fox News. They all do an incredible job. Just Look at Pete Hegseth–not one mistake,” he said.


	“No!” Pirro agreed. “He's my old drinking buddy.”


	Jost then entered, surprising Pirro, who sprayed the wine in her mouth all over his face.

	











	When Trump told Hegseth to give an update on the military's F-18 fighter planes, Pirro asked, “Is it bombing the Houthis?”


	“Close. It fell off the aircraft carrier into the ocean,” Hegseth revealed, prompting another wave of wine.


	Trump then wanted to know if Hegseth was maintaining his sobriety, which he had pledged to do if confirmed as Defense Secretary amid concerns about his drinking.


	“I promised I would never have a bottle touch my lips,” he said, giving himself a convenient loophole.


	The Trump administration official removed a bottle of liquor from his jacket pocket.


	“I do have some news to share. Before I do, Jeanine: You want to take a swig of this?” he offered.


	When she dutifully did, Hegseth, a main figure in several controversies over the use of unsecured Signal chats for battle plans, filled her in.

	“Anyway,” he said, “I accidentally added Kim Jong-un to the group chat.” 


	When Pirro went to spit the liquor at Hegseth, this time he reacted differently: eagerly turning to face her with his mouth agape.

"I rarely comment on rumors, but my mama and I are too tight for anything to ever come between us," the singer wrote.

Miley Cyrus is putting family first. On the heels of dropping her new single, the ballad “More to Lose,” the singer released a statement on Saturday (May 10) in response to rumors of a rift with parents Tish and Billy Ray.


	“I rarely comment on rumors,” Miley noted in an update shared via Instagram Story on her official account. “But my mama and I are too tight for anything to ever come between us. She's my best friend.”


	“Like a lot of moms, she doesn't know how to work her phone and somehow unfollowed me–simple, coincidental, and uninteresting,” she said, in reference to murmurs that Tish had reportedly unfollowed her on the social media app earlier this week. 

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Her statement continued: “My dad and I have had our challenges over the years. Now, in my thirties, family is my priority above all else. I'm at peace knowing bridges have been built and time has done a lot of healing.”


	“Grateful for the good health and love that flows through my family,” Miley concluded her message.


	Fans had expressed concern about the alleged unfollowing in various comments on Tish's recent Instagram posts, to which she responded that she didn't know she'd apparently unfollowed her daughter. “have no idea how that happened but it's fixed now!” read Tish's reply to one of those comments on Wednesday, May 7. (At press time on Saturday, she follows Miley on Instagram.)


	On Wednesday, Billy Ray had posted a video clip with Miley performing at the piano, along with the caption, “Can't wait to see this young lady. Crazy how time flies.”


	On Friday, he uploaded a snapshot of himself with his son Braison, plus Miley and her boyfriend Maxx Morando, all together in celebration of Braison's birthday. 


	Miley's new song “More to Lose” is off of the imminent album Something Beautiful, a 13-track collection due out on May 30. It'll be the follow-up to 2023's Endless Summer Vacation, which was led by the Grammy-winning, Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 single “Flowers”; Endless Summer Vacation reached No. 3 on the Billboard 200 albums chart.


	“I tried to keep it a singular take,” she shared with fans about recording the emotional track “More to Lose.” “It's really a song that's more of a story, and I never want that to be interrupted or overthought or chasing perfection. I never wanted ‘More to Lose' to be perfect, I wanted it to sound beautiful and emotional.”

	











	During a special evening with Spotify last week, Cyrus gave more insight into Something Beautiful, revealing the album's overarching theme as “beauty, but not what beauty represents by a standard of someone else's idea.” In another sound-bite from the event, she said — to cheers from the audience — “On a scale of, I think, one to gay, how gay is this album? It's not only my best album, but also my gayest.”

“Dad was not only a legendary musician whose artistry touched millions around the world, but also a deeply loved husband, father, uncle and brother,” Rodriguez's daughter, Aubry, shared on social media.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



	Johnny Rodriguez, the chart-topping Hispanic country music star and “That's the Way Love Goes” singer, has died. He was 73. 


	Rodriguez's daughter, Aubry Rodriguez, announced his death on social media on Friday.




	“Dad was not only a legendary musician whose artistry touched millions around the world, but also a deeply loved husband, father, uncle and brother whose warmth, humor, and compassion shaped the lives of all who knew him,” she wrote in an Instagram post. “We are immensely grateful for the outpouring of love and support from fans, colleagues and friends during this time of grief.”

	“While the world has lost an extraordinary talent, we have lost someone irreplaceable — and we ask for privacy as we navigate this painful moment together,” Aubry concluded. 


	Rodriguez was one of the first Hispanic country music stars, finding success at the beginning of his career after moving to Nashville at 21 and signing a deal with Mercury Records. His first single with the label, 1972's “Pass Me By (If You're Only Passing Through),” reached No. 9 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart. 


	His first No. 1 hit on the country charts arrived in 1973 with his track “You Always Come Back to Hurting Me,” with his song “Ridin' My Thumb to Mexico” also reaching No. 1 later that year. 


	Rodriguez's debut album, Introducing Johnny Rodriguez, became a No. 1 album on Billboard's Top Country Albums chart in 1973. That same year, he received the most promising vocalist honor at the Academy of Country Music Awards and was nominated for single record of the year for “Pass Me By.” 


	In total, he had six No. 1 tracks on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, including “That's the Way Love Goes,” “I Just Can't Get Her Out Out of My Mind,” “Just Get Up and Close the Door” and “Love Put a Song in My Heart.”


	He later signed with Epic Records in 1979 and worked alongside producer Billy Sherrill. In 2007, he was inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame. 


	Survivors include his daughter, Aubry, whom Rodriguez shared with his ex-wife, Debbie McNeely.

	Amid a widespread crackdown on immigration and refugee programs, the Trump administration is slated to bring white South Africans to the U.S. as refugees on Monday, multiple news outlets reported. They will now have a pathway to American citizenship. 


	The move is the first in a “much larger-scale relocation effort,” White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller told reporters on Friday. The Trump administration suspended the refugee resettlement program on his first day in office for his second term and froze funding for resettlement agencies. In Uganda, as one example, these cuts mean that food rations for a million people have been cut off.


	“What's happening in South Africa fits the textbook definition of why the refugee program was created,” Miller said. “This is race-based persecution. The refugee program is not intended as a solution for global poverty — and historically, it has been used that way.”

	The Lever first reported the news that white South Africans could be admitted to the U.S. as refugees. 

	











	The U.S. will give about 50 white South Africans help with housing, groceries, and other needs, according to a document reviewed by the Associated Press. The Trump administration could admit as many as 1,000 Afrikaners this year. They will be receiving emergency support from the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is a division of the Department of Health and Human Services.


	In February, the Trump administration issued an executive order that the U.S. would “promote the resettlement of Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination.” The White House also released an executive order saying the U.S. would only admit refugees who “can fully and appropriately assimilate.”


Elon Musk, the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, was born in South Africa. He has said in a post on X that a political group is promoting a “white genocide” in the country, a claim that has been widely denied.

	“Far-right-wing groups in South Africa actively go to America and promulgate this idea of a white genocide because, of course, when you have a high murder rate, white people do get murdered,” Gareth Newham, head of the justice and violence prevention program at the Institute of Security Studies in South Africa told NBC News in February. White people are likely targeted because they are relatively wealthy, he said.

	











	At the root of the Trump administration's claims is South Africa's recent expropriation law that allows the government to seize land under certain circumstances. Thirty years after the end of Apartheid, about seven percent of South Africans are white — mainly descendants of Dutch settlers — but they own almost three quarters of the land. So far, no land has been seized.


	The government of South Africa released a statement Friday saying that the idea that Afrikaners are discriminated against is “unfounded.” 


	“​​It is most regrettable that it appears that the resettlement of South Africans to the United States under the guise of being ‘refugees' is entirely politically motivated and designed to question South Africa's constitutional democracy; a country which has in fact suffered true persecution under Apartheid rule and has worked tirelessly to prevent such levels of discrimination from ever occurring again,” said Chrispin Phiri, spokesperson for the Ministry of International Relations and Cooperation.

	It can often take years to get approval to come to the U.S. as a refugee, but the Afrikaners only had to wait a few months. The status of other refugees is in limbo. Last Monday, a judge ordered the Trump administration to admit 12,000 refugees who had previously been blocked from entering the country. 


	“We are profoundly disturbed that the administration has slammed the door in the face of thousands of other refugees approved by [the Department of Homeland Security] months ago, notwithstanding courts ordering the White House to let many of them in,” Mark Hetfield, the president of HIAS, a Jewish humanitarian aid society, said in a statement. “That's just not right.”

Life. But how would we know it?

The world of astronomy is abuzz with excitement. Have we discovered the first-ever evidence of off-world life?

Is the signal extracted from the interstellar noise a telltale of active biology?

“Astronomers have detected the most promising signs yet of a possible biosignature outside the solar system, although they remain cautious,” states a Cambridge University press release.

What has them excited is the planet K2-18b.

We only know it exists by the shadow it casts when it passes between its star and the Earth. But that shadow, like a stained-glass window, can tell a story.

Across the gulf of space, the James Webb Space Telescope has managed to capture its light spectrum and atmospheric gases like methane, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and dimethyl sulphide also cast shadows when light strikes them.

The challenge for astronomy is to catch enough of this distant light to dissect reliably and to interpret that data accurately.

The Cambridge University astronomers have attempted to do just that. Scientists the world over have since been sciencing their results.

How was the data collected? What data was collected? How was it analysed? Does it support the conclusion?

“While this discovery is intriguing, most astronomers – including the paper's authors – aren't ready to claim that it means extraterrestrial life exists,” says University of Arizona distinguished professor of astronomy Chris Impey.

There simply isn't enough data. Yet.

“Searching for life beyond Earth is one of the great, profound pursuits of humankind. But any claim of life out there will require a thorough study by the scientific community as a whole before we have confidence in the results,” adds The Planetary Society's chief scientist, Dr Bruce Betts.

In a post-truth world, that confidence is more important than ever.

“Just like the boy that cried wolf, no one wants a series of false claims to further diminish society's trust in scientists,” Johns Hopkins University astrophysicist Kevin Stevenson argues.

“Context is important when it comes to science communication, particularly for a hot-button topic like the search for life beyond Earth, and we need to be responsible stewards in that respect.”

Brave new worlds

“It is in no one's interest to claim prematurely that we have detected life,” Professor Nikku Madhusudhan, a University of Cambridge astronomer and lead author of the study, told media.

But he still called his study a “revolutionary moment”.

“It's the first time humanity has seen potential biosignatures on a habitable planet,” the professor explained.

He added that the discovery was “as big as it gets” for scientists.

We don't know much about K2-18b. But we've guessed a lot.

It was found in 2015 by the Kepler Space Telescope.

It has a radius about 2.4 times larger than that of Earth. Its year is just 32.9 days and it orbits within the habitable “Goldilocks” Zone (warm enough for liquid water) of a cool red dwarf star about 120 light-years away in the direction of the constellation of Leo.

University of Cambridge astronomers believe it may have a thin hydrogen atmosphere over an oceanic surface. Thus the term “Hycean” (hydrogen-ocean) world.

But the opposite could also fit the limited known facts: K2-18b could have a thick atmosphere over a magma sea.

One way to find out is to determine what that atmosphere is made o. That involves extracting a reliable spectrum from a shadow flickering within a pinprick of starlight.

The cause of all the excitement is what the Cambridge University researchers believe is the presence of dimethyl sulphide.

This molecule is only found on Earth as the by-product of plankton and bacterial life in our oceans. And that makes it a contender for the position of “biomarker” – a chemical “smoking gun” to the presence of life on other worlds.

But has dimethyl sulphide really been found on K2-18b?

“Every detector has some noise from the random motion of electrons,” Professor Impey explained.

“The signal should be strong enough to have a low probability of arising by chance from this noise.”

The planet was first photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2016. Astrobiologists thought they saw indications of water vapor.

Upon revision, this later turned out to be methane. The first look with the more powerful JWST was made by Professor Madhusudhan's team about two years ago.

Analyzing a different set of wavelengths than the most recent study, this initially seemed to show the presence of methane and carbon dioxide – and a hint of dimethyl sulphide.

But the raw data they drew their conclusions from has since been re-examined by different scientists using different methods. They have not confirmed the presence of CO2 or dimethyl sulphide.

The data from the most recent survey was released for general review on April 28. Does this raw data show what the Cambridge University researchers believe it does?

To be science, independent scientists must be able to draw the same conclusions using various methods, and the premise has to be proven correct.

Otherworldly chemistry

“We didn't know for sure whether the signal we saw last time was due to DMS (dimethyl sulphide), but just the hint of it was exciting enough for us to have another look with JWST using a different instrument,” Professor Madhusudhan explained.

It's the second time the Cambridge University team has found the molecule.

“This is an independent line of evidence, using a different instrument than we did before and a different wavelength range of light, where there is no overlap with the previous observations. The signal came through strong and clear.”

But K2-18b isn't Earth.

Evidence has begun to emerge that dimethyl sulphide can be produced by non-biological means.

Its signature spectrum has been spotted in the clouds of dust and gas that drift between stars. It may have been seen on an uninhabitable comet.

Laboratory studies hint that it could be broken out of other molecules under UV light.

Professor Madhusudhan concedes there could be previously unknown chemical processes at play.

He and his team remain confident in the strength of their findings.

“Decades from now, we may look back at this point in time and recognise it was when the living universe came within reach,” Professor Madhusudhan said.

“This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we're alone in the universe is one we're capable of answering.”

But, given the rarity of dimethyl sulphide, the Oxford University measurements have raised eyebrows.

Especially as they indicate K2-18 b's atmosphere is awash with it in concentrations thousands of times greater than Earth's.

“The claim is intriguing, as these gases can be associated with biological activity,” a statement released by the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) reads.

“On the other hand, the signal is modest, ambiguous, and potentially explainable as the result of noise or systematic error.”

But, like all research, this study is just one step in a winding journey, filled with obstacles and dead-ends.

“This study is not a confirmation of life; not even a hypothesis that life is present on K2-18b, but a demonstration of where our methodological strengths and limitations lie, and what must come next to an unambiguous claim of life beyond Earth,” the SETI statement concludes.

In science's famous last words: More research is needed.

“It'll take time to figure all this out,” adds The Planetary Society.

Different teams will do their own investigations, collect more data, learn more about how DMS might be produced, and better understand how it might show up in a planet's atmosphere.

Only then will we have a chance at the full story.

Scores of internet sleuths are convinced a mysterious US mountain is home to a secret alien base...apparently. Alaska's giant Mount Hayes rises 8,000 feet and is one of the largest peaks in the country. It lies in the icy wilderness and ranks as one of the most prominent peaks in the world.

At a glance, nothing would appear remarkable about it. But the mountain has long been the subject of incredible alien conspiracies thanks to some apparent UFO sightings through the years. Those claims drew such interest, Apple TV is even airing a small series about it titled The Secrets of Mount Hayes.

There's also a a short film on YouTube being aired by the Travel Channel, titled: Searching for UFO's Beneath Mount Hayes.

A trailer for the series starts with an interview with Jonny Enoch, a self-described Paranormal Researcher, who says: "In my opinion there are unpredictable, dangerous forces at work here."

So what's really going on there?

According to LadBible, mystery stems from historic CIA documents that incredibly claimed aliens could be operating hidden bases on Earth, that includes deep under the sea and inside remote mountain ranges (and best taken with a pinch of salt, of course).

They were reportedly declassified through the US Freedom of Information Act.

And sensationally, the unassuming Mount Hayes was named among them, along with Monte Perdido in Spain and underwater sites off the coast of Puerto Rico and near the Bahamas.

One report was titled Description of Personnel Associated ET Bases, points to the peak as the "main base" used by aliens.

That's because it has been home to some bizarre UFO sightings, with witnesses reporting unexplained aircraft behaving in strange ways.

This was during the 1970s and 80s, a time when the CIA ran experiments with people who claimed they could perceive information about distant objects.

It was part of the CIA's STARGATE program, at a time the US was in a Cold War space race with the Soviet Union (which may explain a lot).

The report adds that one person interviewed said they could remotely see an "entity" with a "very large, round-shaped head" and a "very unhuman appearance" (yes, really).

The sighting was also described as "very pale" with a "sharp nose". Funnily enough, we can't seem to find any records of this person being drug tested, however.

As crazy as these claims sound, they continue to fascinate UFO hunters.

The verified History Channel, which has 14.5million subscribers, shared one video titled: CIA Analyst Discovers UFO Base in Alaska.

To date, it has 610,000 views.

Another video, titled Does Mount Hayes hold the dark secret to thousands of disappearances? That has 123,000 views.

So while you'd have thought a hidden alien base in a US mountain was something that would have been discovered by now, the mystery continues to live long in the imagination of internet sleuths.

Two studies show major progress in the field of photonic microchips.

Electronic microchips are at the heart of the modern world. They're found in our laptops, our smartphones, our cars and our household appliances. For years, manufacturers have been making them more powerful and efficient, which increases the performance of our electronic devices.

But that trend is now faltering because of the increased cost and complexity of manufacturing chips, as well as performance limits set by the laws of physics. This is happening just as there's a need for increased computing power because of the boom in artificial intelligence (AI).

An alternative to the electronic microchips we currently use are photonic chips. These use light instead of electricity to achieve higher performance. However, photonic chips have not yet taken off due to a number of hurdles. Now, two papers published in Nature address some of these roadblocks, offering essential stepping stones to achieving the computing power required by complex artificial intelligence systems.

By using light (photons) instead of electricity (electrons) for the transport and processing of information, photonic computing promises higher speeds and greater bandwidths with greater efficiency. This is because it does not suffer from the loss of electrical current due to a phenomenon known as resistance, as well as unwanted heat loss from electrical components.

Photonic computing is also particularly suited for performing what are known as matrix multiplications — mathematical operations that are fundamental to AI.

Those are some of the benefits. The challenges, however, are not trivial. In the past, the performance of photonic chips has generally been studied in isolation. But because of the dominance of electronics in modern technology, photonic hardware will need to be integrated with those electronic systems.

However, converting photons into electrical signals can slow down processing times since light operates at higher speeds. Photonic computing is also based around analogue operations rather than digital ones. This can reduce precision and limit the type of computing tasks that can be carried out.

It's also difficult to scale them up from small prototypes because large-scale photonic circuits cannot currently be fabricated with sufficient accuracy. Photonic computing will require its own software and algorithms, compounding the challenges of integration and compatibility with other technology.

The two new papers in Nature address many of these hurdles. Bo Peng, from Singapore-based company Lightelligence, and colleagues demonstrate a new type of processor for photonic computing called a Photonic Arithmetic Computing Engine (Pace). This processor has a low latency, which means that there is a minimal delay between an input or command and the corresponding response or action by the computer.

The large-scale Pace processor, which has more than 16,000 photonic components, can solve difficult computing tasks, demonstrating the feasibility of the system for real world applications. The processor shows how integration of photonic and electronic hardware, accuracy, and the need for different software and algorithms can be resolved. It also demonstrates that the technology can be scaled up.

This marks a significant development, despite some speed limitations of the current hardware.

—China achieves quantum supremacy claim with new chip 1 quadrillion times faster than the most powerful supercomputers

—Light-powered computer chip can train AI much faster than components powered by electricity

In a separate paper, Nicholas Harris, from California-based company Lightmatter, and colleagues describe a photonic processor that was able to run two AI systems with accuracy similar to those of conventional electronic processors. The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of their photonic processor through generating Shakespeare-like text, accurately classifying movie reviews and playing classic Atari computer games such as Pac-Man.

The platform is also potentially scalable, though in this case limitations of the materials and engineering used curtailed one measure of the processor's speed and its overall computational capabilities.

Both teams suggest that their photonic systems can be part of scalable next generation hardware that can support the use of AI. This would finally make photonics viable, though further refinements will be needed. These will involve the use of more effective materials or designs.
