                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is fast approaching, with participating teams ramping up preparations ahead of the tournament's June 14 kickoff. But things have taken an unfortunate turn for Sergio Ramos, as the Spanish defender has suffered a major setback at Monterrey just one month before the competition begins. Toluca advanced on away goals, eliminating Monterrey in a crushing blow that triggered swift repercussions within the club. Following the loss, Monterrey's front office decided to part ways with head coach Martin Demichelis. The decision was made by sporting director Antonio Noriega, who cited a string of disappointing results and internal conflict between the coaching staff and players. I will continue with the same strength and integrity that define me, but of course, there are things that don't depend on me,” he said during the post-match press conference. Real Madrid's Carlo Ancelotti takes jab at Barcelona over Club World Cup absence ahead of El Clasico Demichelis joined the Mexican side in August 2024 after a stint with River Plate. He departs after just two tournaments and one full season in charge, having led the team in 43 matches with a record of 20 wins, 11 draws, and 12 losses. While Demichelis faced criticism over the team's recent performances, he was the first and only coach Ramos has worked under since joining Monterrey. His dismissal now leaves the club racing against time to find a suitable replacement ahead of the Club World Cup. Monterrey will compete in Group E of the tournament alongside Inter Milan, River Plate, and Urawa Red Diamonds. Ramos and his team will open against the Italian side on June 17, face River Plate on June 21, and close the group stage against the Japanese club on June 25. Includes: every MLS game and Leagues Cup A shocking incident has shaken Liga MX side Monterrey, revealing deep internal turmoil just days before a crucial fixture. Rayados only find themselves spiraling—and now embroiled in controversy after a training ground altercation ended with one of their top players hospitalized. This match could be decisive in the La Liga title race. With both teams battling fiercely, every point is crucial. Kylian Mbappé is tearing up La Liga!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Like anything in FIFA, it hasn't gone without controversy. The MLS already has two teams set and ready to compete in the Inter Miami and Seattle Sounders tournament. There is a chance for MLS to have one more spot in the tournament due to an open spot, LAFC was awarded with being selected for a play-in game with that open spot on the line. Club Leon from Mexico was removed from the competition after being set to play Chelsea when the teams were originally announced. Club Leon was informed by FIFA that they were no longer permitted to compete due to breaking ownership rules. This states that an owner or ownership group cannot own more than one team. LAFC fans are thrilled to have a chance to compete, while fans across the MLS are upset that other teams were not considered. YOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Top Takeaways from the U.S. Open Cup Round of 32 A few teams across the MLS thought they should have been selected for this qualifying match due to recent success. A 2023 MLS Cup victory and a strong season last year had many in the Crew fan base hoping they would be selected for their domestic league success. Before we talk about hypotheticals, we need to mention that LAFC won't know if they compete in the end of the month when they play Club America. That game will take place on May 31st in LA. If LAFC can defeat Club America, they will be inserted in group D, which could be a favorable group for the club. The other two teams consist of Es Tunis of Turkey and Flamengo in Brazil, despite not being in a top-flight league, both teams have high quality. With the rise of the MLS quality in play there are many fans and critics out there that believe they can contend in their group and make it to the knockout rounds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Catalans' electrifying wide men put Los Blancos to the sword on Sunday as they came out on top in a seven-goal thriller A Raphinha and Lamine Yamal masterclass put Barcelona on the brink of another La Liga triumph after a remarkable 4-3 comeback win over Real Madrid on Sunday. Things then went from bad to worse for Barca when Mbappe was on hand to finish off a rapid-fire counter-attack to make it 2-0 just nine minutes later. Madrid were indebted to their own 'keeper Thibaut Courtois after he made excellent stops to deny Eric Garcia and Yamal, but there was nothing he could do to stop the former's header in the 19th minute. The galvanised hosts kept pushing for an equaliser and got it in spectacular fashion when Yamal curled a stunning finish past a helpless Courtois just after the half-hour mark from the edge of the area. A shell-shocked Madrid, who were still finding joy on the transition and with long balls over the top, could not handle Barca's high press and coughed up a third goal two minutes later through Raphinha. Then, mere moments after Los Blancos had a penalty overturned for offside in the build-up, Raphinha pinched the ball off a dawdling Lucas Vazquez, and then Ferran Torres set him up to tuck the ball home on the stroke of half-time. And just when it looked like the league leaders would cruise to victory, the lethal Mbappe grabbed his hat-trick after Vinicius Jr neatly set up the 26-year-old. Raphinha then missed a sitter to put the contest to bed, and despite a nervy finale, which included both Mbapp and Fermin Lopez having goals chalked off, Hansi Flick's team moved seven points clear at the top of La Liga with just three matches remaining having beaten Madrid all four times in all competitions this season.

The Danish striker missed three clear chances, but the worst sight on a grim Sunday was the young French defender hobbling off the pitch

Manchester United were brought back down to earth after their euphoric passage to the Europa League final as they slumped to their first home defeat against West Ham in 18 years, going down 2-0 and sinking all the way to 16th in the Premier League table. And to make matters worse, they will almost certainly be without Leny Yoro in the final after the Frenchman limped off the pitch while looking utterly distraught having suffered a foot injury.

Former United full-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka was in brilliant form against his old club, playing a huge role in Tomas Soucek's first-half opening strike and then setting up Jarrod Bowen to score the second goal. Bowen's goal further killed the mood after Yoro had been forced off and had to be comforted by Harry Maguire as he trotted down the tunnel, almost certainly believing he will miss the showdown in Bilbao against Tottenham on May 21.

United's European run has been the only good thing about their dire campaign and this defeat, their 17th of the season, was a reminder of how big a job Ruben Amorim faces in making his side a force again in the competition that matters the most.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jamie Carragher has said what he believes Liverpool should set as the price for Real Madrid to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold ahead of the Club World Cup this summer. But Carragher has urged his former club to ask Madrid for a £10m fee if they want them to rip Alexander-Arnold's contract up early, given how much money Los Blancos could earn through the tournament. Carragher said on Sky Sports: “You're announcing it now to give Real Madrid the opportunity to maybe sign you for the Club World Cup, so that's what I was talking about a couple of weeks ago.” Sky Sports host David Jones then asked: “What is it, a hundred million to win the thing?” Jones then asked: “So you could help a major European rival by helping them win the thing?” Carragher said: “Right, well, but if they're going to win a hundred million and he's going to help them, because don't forget, they haven't got any right back. Neville concluded: “Well, the price has just been set, mate.” 👉 Alexander-Arnold move proves truth Liverpool refuse to accept in ranking of clubs by transfer allure 👉 Liverpool urged to ‘bend over' Real Madrid with one ‘extraordinary' demand for ‘early' Trent deal 👉 Mikel Arteta ‘openly disliked by staff' as report reveals Liverpool nonsense ‘didn't go down brilliantly' Former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan has encouraged Liverpool to stand firm because Real Madrid are “not a charity”. “He'd keep you to the contract if there wasn't an alternative. £100 million and if Liverpool give them a player to help them with that, they've just given Madrid £100 million to make sure Madrid can maintain their dominance in European football so why? Who are going to be playing in the Champions League next year? Trent Alexander-Arnold has achieved what he wanted to achieve and you can believe the benefits of Trent Alexander going on a free have landed where… in his pay packet.” Jamie Carragher says Arteta's Arsenal legacy may be ‘years of groundwork for the benefit of a successor' if he fails to win trophies next season. Pundit Alan Shearer has picked out a potential Trent Alexander-Arnold replacement for Premier League champions Liverpool to sign. Carragher claims Arteta currently sounds more like a ‘social media fan' than Arsenal manager after his recent complaints about Liverpool and PSG. Joe Cole has discussed the best position for Trent Alexander-Arnold at Real Madrid, after listing off four players he will not get in the team ahead of.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid are currently on course to end the season without a major trophy, but they could get some respite with the Club World Cup, which they are one of the favourites to win this summer. But there is a chance that they will go into the tournament without one of their best players. Jude Bellingham has been nursing a shoulder problem for well over a year, with the original injury having occurred in November 2023 during a match between Real Madrid and Rayo Vallecano. And since then, the England international has wore armour-like strapping on the affected area, of which the amount has gradually increased in order to ensure protection from further aggravation. The situation will come to an end this summer as Bellingham is set to undergo surgery, but as Relevo have reported, it is not clear when exactly he will go under the knife. Bellingham would be sidelined for a number of weeks upon undergoing surgery, which is why he has not yet had it. If he were to wait after the conclusion of Real Madrid's participation at the Club World Cup, it would be inevitable that he misses the start of the 2025-26 season, which is something that club bosses are keen to avoid. In this case, he would not travel to the United States, but he would be fine for pre-season. Defeat in El Clasico would all-but ensure that Real Madrid miss out on the La Liga title, and with the domestic season basically done in this case, there is scope for the operation to happen as soon as possible – but the club itself is not keen on this. Bellingham himself is keen to have surgery as soon as possible, which is understandable given the pain he has been in over the last 18 months. It remains to be seen whether he goes under the knife in May, June or July.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Germany international Gerald Asamoah has revealed why African countries will struggle to win the FIFA World Cup. Asamoah, 46, helped Germany finish second to Brazil at the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and Korea after being neglected by his homeland Ghana. The burley former Schalke forward believes countries from the African continent still face challenges in competing at the highest level of global football. "I want to see this before I leave the earth, but it is not going to be easy," he said, as reported by Joy Sports. "It is about teamwork, and this is a problem Africans have. We have always had some issues in the team," he added. Ghana and Senegal have come close to making it to the quarterfinals, but have ultimately fallen short of clinching the trophy. The next World Cup will be held in 2026 across the USA, Canada and Mexico, with qualifiers still ongoing. Ghana's Black Stars, who sit top of Group I with 15 points, are on course to qualify for the tournament. They will face Chad and Mali in September's World Cup qualifiers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In addition to those four matches that will be decisive for one of the most important titles of the season, the offices at Valdebebas are also focused on the upcoming Club World Cup. Indeed, the board of directors led by Florentino Pérez has made it clear on more than one occasion that it is a tournament of great importance for the first team. That's why all competitive efforts, especially regarding injured players, are focused on the competition to be held in the United States during the months of June and July. The footballer who might miss out on that desired competition is Jude Bellingham. The English "5" has been responsible for many of Real Madrid's sporting successes since he joined the first team, but most of his time is marked by an ailment. His left shoulder, injured since November 2023, has caused certain problems for the Birmingham midfielder. The discomfort has continued throughout the current season, bringing the footballer to a breaking point where he would need to make that trip to the operating room as soon as possible. The information revealed by "Rodra" states that Jude Bellingham would like to undergo his operation as soon as possible, given that the recovery from that intervention is approximately one month. That's why Real Madrid would have a different perspective on this situation. The reality is that Jude Bellingham has been avoiding the opportunity to undergo the necessary operation to correct his shoulder ailment for too long.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senegal and Portugal will go head-to-head for the third place The first semi-final of the tournament delivered a gripping encounter between two teams making their second appearances at this stage – Belarus and Senegal. Moments later, Hapon extended their lead with a flying header. Belarus continued to apply pressure, and Bryshtsel struck again, securing his brace with a composed finish inside the final two minutes of the period, to put Belarus 4-1 ahead heading into the final period. However, Belarus maintained their composure and Bokach capitalised on a counter-attack to score Belarus' fifth, to seal an emphatic 5-2 victory and create history for the nation. Brazil overpowered Portugal to reach a consecutive FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup final. In a heavyweight semi-final clash, defending champions and six-time winners Brazil faced off against two-time champions Portugal, who struck first midway through the opening period. Brilhante delivered a pinpoint cross to Bernardo, who rose to head the ball into the net, giving Portugal a 1-0 lead. Moments later, Filipe Silva fired a long-range shot into the net to put Brazil in front. Brazil aggressively managed the closing minutes, stifling any Portuguese comeback attempts, as the holders marched on to yet another final, with a 4-2 win over Portugal. Senegal and Portugal will go head-to-head for the third place Belarus and Portugal won their respective groups, accumulating maximum points Brazil qualified for the quarter-finals, as Senegal clinched their second victory, and Spain and Oman picked up their first wins Chile, Senegal, Italy and defending champions Brazil all impress The defending champions registered maximum points from their opening matches At Beach Soccer Worldwide, we use cookies to make our website work for you and enhance your user experience.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 1950, Uruguay were crowned champions again to make it 2-2 between the two countries. As they retained their world title in 1938, his nation had held the game's most prestigious piece of silverware for 16 years. And they would come out on top again here. Only 31 of the 73 FIFA member nations entered, with Argentina refusing to compete in a tournament they'd wanted to host, West Germany banned from FIFA so soon after the war, previous finalists Austria and Czechoslovakia simply not entering, and Italy present but badly affected by the Superga air disaster in May 1949, in which several of their best players had died. Then France withdrew after realising the considerable travelling that would be involved between games in a country as huge as Brazil. Brazil's downstairs neighbours Uruguay, obviously, didn't have to come far, and while the European nations struggled with the South American climate, it wasn't really an issue for the competition's 1930 winners. But withdrawals left the World Cup with only 13 competing teams, not 16. It was too late to conduct another draw, so Uruguay were fortunate to be placed in a two-team group alongside Bolivia (they had qualified without playing a game after Argentina withdrew), who they thrashed 8-0. Contemporary reports suggest the scoreline could have been much greater had the Uruguayans — three up after 23 minutes — not eased off. A draw would have been enough for Brazil to finish top of the final group and so lift the World Cup, which would have been a quite unsatisfactory climax. While doubt persists about whether Uruguay's victorious manager in 1930 was truly a manager by today's definition of the job, there is scepticism about whether their manager in 1950 had complete authority over his side. While Juan Lopez Fontana had that role officially, the players grew unhappy with his defensive approach. Ahead of that final game against Brazil, the team held a meeting where they were encouraged by captain Obdulio Varela to be braver than Lopez Fontana had requested. Indeed, at this stage in football's development, a team's captain was often considered more influential than the manager. Varela was commended for his pre-match team talks, for ordering his team-mates to behave in certain ways at key moments, and, after the tournament, for disobeying orders not to leave the team hotel, and going out drinking with Brazilians instead. Lopez Fontana, in fairness, was a highly respected figure who was still in his job come the 1954 World Cup, then served as an assistant to several subsequent Uruguay managers. While other national teams had shifted towards a system featuring a third defender — the centre-half dropping back — Uruguay's base formation was more closely related to the system used by previous World Cup-winning sides: two physical defenders, three half-backs, two creative inside-forwards, two quick wingers and a centre-forward. That said, left-half Victor Andrade (nephew of fellow World Cup winner Jose Andrade from 1930) was written about in almost purely defensive terms, and right-half Schubert Gambetta is also sometimes listed as a defender, too. As other nations beefed up their defence by having the centre-half drop back, Uruguay were gradually moving their right-half and left-half in the same direction. This is why — as Jonathan Wilson notes in his book Inverting The Pyramid — Uruguay are unique in using the No 4 and No 6 as their full-backs in their traditional numbering system. Like every successful side in these early years of the World Cup, Uruguay 1950 had an outstanding centre-half in Varela, who was physically dominant and also a key attacking weapon. His late, long-range equaliser to secure a 2-2 draw with Spain in their opening match of the final group stage was crucial in allowing them to challenge for the trophy. Juan Alberto Schiaffino had all the hallmarks of a legendary South American attacker: slender, elegant, highly creative. He was also highly influential four years later at the next World Cup in Switzerland — Uruguay held Hungary, the outstanding side of that tournament, to a 2-2 draw after 90 minutes in the semi-final, but once Schiaffino got injured, they ran out of ideas. Upon his move to Milan following that 1954 tournament, he adopted a deeper role, roughly in the Andrea Pirlo mould, before eventually dropping back even further to become a renowned sweeper for Roma. Like many South Americans of this period who moved to Serie A, he also switched international allegiance and began to represent Italy rather than his homeland. Bookmakers offered odds of just 1/10 for Brazil to lift the trophy, and there was such confidence across the host country after demolishing Sweden and Spain 7-1 and 6-1 respectively in their first two matches of the second group stage that various newspapers printed front pages on matchday hailing the anticipated triumph. Uruguay took things a step further and used them to line the floor of their bathroom. This didn't help their inside-right Julio Perez, who was so intimidated by the crowd (174,000 officially, possibly around 200,000 unofficially, and probably the largest in football history) that he wet himself as the anthems were being played. Foreshadowing Brazil's collapse, shortly before the game, their flag was raised… upside-down. Once the match kicked off, it was all Brazil, with Uruguay defending their box manfully and hoofing the ball clear rather than putting together any notable counter-attacks. This prompted Uruguay captain Varela to pick an argument with George Reader, the English referee, over a non-existent offside, which included him requesting an interpreter at one stage. Varela knew there had been no offside, he simply wanted to halt Brazil's momentum. Uruguay hit back, and their key player was now Alcides Ghiggia, who constantly motored past Brazil's hapless left-half Bigode. Midway through the half, he beat Bigode, looked up and found Schiaffino making a run to the near post for a cutback. The ball bobbled slightly before Schiaffino hit it, but this meant he produced a shot with both power and curl inside the near post, although he later admitted he hadn't intended to strike it quite in that manner. That result would still see Brazil crowned champions. Schiaffino was waiting to score a carbon-copy goal, and that's what Brazil goalkeeper Moacir Barbosa expected. But Ghiggia could also fire home at the near post, as he'd done a week earlier in that draw with Spain. That's what he did here, rifling home the winner. He and Brazil's other black players received disgraceful abuse after this loss, being labelled unpatriotic, while Barbosa was forced to flee his home due to death threats. But that wasn't the end of his pain. More than 40 years after this match, in a country big on superstition, he was both removed as a commentator from the broadcast of a Brazil game and shunned when visiting the national team's training camp, because of fears he would bring them bad luck. He died in 2000, aged 79, after years of loneliness. Amid all the anger they directed at their own team, Brazilians reacted sportingly to Uruguay's victory. They applauded the winners at their trophy presentation. Ghiggia was always respected in Brazil, returning to the Maracana in 2009 to be inducted into the stadium's walk of fame. He died in 2015 — 65 years to the day after his famous World Cup-clinching goal. All sorts of quotes have been attributed to Ghiggia, some of which seem a bit too Hollywood to be taken seriously. “Barbosa did the logical thing,” he reportedly said. Uruguay only played four games — two fewer than Brazil. Not only did they have the fortune to compete in a two-team opening group against minnows Bolivia, they didn't perform particularly well in the second one, having to come from behind in that 2-2 with Spain and only squeezing past Sweden 3-2 thanks to an 85th-minute goal. In contrast, Brazil had beaten the same opponents by a combined score of 13-2, having previously finished top of their (four-team) first-round group via clean-sheet wins over Mexico (4-0) and Yugoslavia (2-0) and a 2-2 of their own with Switzerland. Often, knockout competition can produce the ‘wrong' winners, but this World Cup was decided by a league table, which tends to favour the better sides on paper, and Brazil still couldn't get over the line. By the time of the next World Cup, they had ditched their white kit, now associated with this 1950 failure, in favour of the yellow, green and blue strip known worldwide today. Four editions in, the World Cup had still been won by only two nations, with Italy and Uruguay crowned champions of the two tournaments played on their home continents of Europe and South America respectively.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite the day being about Bayern Munich's victory over Borussia Mönchengladbach, successful Bundesliga title victory and the last days of Thomas Müller's career at the Die Rekordmeister, a reporter inevitably still prepared questions about transfers. Board member for sport Max Eberl was the victim in this case, being bombarded with questions about potential transfer targets Jonathan Tah and Florian Wirtz as well as the Club World Cup and summer transfer window business. Eberl refused to talk about Wirtz or Tah, but he did address the Club World Cup, thoughts about registering new transfers for the competition and a surprising reveal: “Because we have this new registration window between June 1 and June 10, we will be able to register [confirmed transfer in January from TSG Hoffenheim] Tom Bischof,” Eberl confirmed in a post match interview. And if you are speaking to people about transfers- more incoming than departing transfers- and it is possible, then you have the chance to do it and it would be nice to have that player for the Club World Cup.” This certainly raises a few more questions, though. Who are Bayern in talks with that could join before the Club World Cup? The June registration window ends in about a month, after all. Eberl also hinted that departing players may not necessarily be kept for the Club World Cup. Müller signed a short term extension but someone like Eric Dier, who is already confirmed to be leaving the club at the end of his contract on June 30, may not participate in the tournament at all, even though the group stages take place before the end of June.
