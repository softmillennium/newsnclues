                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic is at one of the lowest points in his long career. But one tennis legend believes Novak will struggle to reach that illustrious 25th Grand Slam. “I would never underestimate him, but I would be surprised if he won another major, let's put it that way,” 18-time Grand Slam winner Chrissie Evert said on a phone interview. It's a tough thing to hear, especially from one of the best performers that Roland-Garros has ever seen. She has seen a lot of success, but believes Djokovic's declining abilities make him less likely to claim another Slam. “I mean, you've got to give the guy credit. I would be pleasantly surprised, just with his results in the past and he's human…I'm not feeling it." Ironically, Djokovic's last tournament win came at Roland-Garros, but it was the 2024 Olympics. Novak Djokovic training hard today.He's healthy and will play his first match in Geneva next week. MORE: Carlos Alcaraz sends message to Jannik Sinner before world no.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arthur Fils continued his impressive recent ATP Masters 1000 record and his dominance against Stefanos Tsitsipas at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome on Sunday, when he advanced to the fourth round following a high-quality display. The dynamic Frenchman recovered from a slow start on Grand Stand Arena, where he entertained the crowd with his flashy shotmaking to earn a comeback 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory against Tsitsipas in one hour and 55 minutes. I could not do a lot of things but in the second set I started to find the rhythm and a way to fight and was happy to finish strong in the third." He now holds a standout 4-0 Lexus ATP Head2Head series record against the former Nitto ATP Finals champion following his latest win. "If you let him play, I think he is one of the best clay-court players," Fils said on Tsitsipas. Fils is 7-2 against Top 20 players on clay since the start of 2024 and will look to improve that record when he meets the No. Zverev beat Lithuanian qualifier Vilius Gaubas 6-4, 6-0 in 86 minutes. "I didn't play my best in the first set but he challenged me... He has won four matches here already, beating quality players like Denis [Shapovalov]," Zverev said. He is playing great tennis and I am sure we will see more of him." The defending champion Zverev, who also triumphed in the Italian capital in 2017, was comfortable throughout his third-round win and has now won his his past nine matches in Rome. The German is seeking his second trophy of the season after winning on home soil in Munich last month. "In the beginning I felt like it was a bit difficult for me and it was really windy," Zverev said. "The wind really calmed down after the first set and then it was easier for me to get in a rhythm and have clean strokes. I am someone who wants to play with power and doesn't have variety as much, so for me when I am hitting the ball cleanly it is a benefit to me and my game." Daniil Medvedev was also an early winner on Day 5 in the Italian capital, where he dispatched Alexei Popyrin 6-4, 6-1. Seeking his first title since then, the 10th seed will take confidence from his dominant win against Popyrin. The 29-year-old saved six of seven break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and committed 16 unforced errors to 28 from Popyrin, who won his maiden Masters 1000 title in Montreal last year. Medvedev faces Lorenzo Musetti in the fourth round. The Italian recorded his 150th tour-level win with a 6-4, 6-3 victory against Brandon Nakashima. Backed by a vocal home crowd on Sunday, Musetti pulled Nakashima from corner to corner with his variety and explosive play.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner is back to winning ways after his three-month suspension, having emerged victorious in his first match at the Italian Open. The three-time Grand Slam champion lifted the title in Melbourne in January, but accepted a three-month doping ban shortly after. He received a hugely warm welcome at the Italian Open, with former world number one Jim Courier now sharing how those fans would have felt while watching the home favourite in action. They were excited to see Sinner back on court here in Rome and he did not disappoint. READ MORE: Jannik Sinner explains what he was doing early in the first set to find out where his level was at the Italian Open “He was attacking off of both wings, taking it to Navone, who is a high quality clay court player and we are talking about Navone yesterday, who is a guy who does not necessarily have overt power off the groundstrokes but today he did. “He decided to try and nuke his ground strokes as the match went on to try and match Sinner, as the first set he was just getting left behind. Sinner needed one hour and 38 minutes to make it past Navone, who certainly tested his opponent on occasion. Many home fans may have feared their star man might have been rusty heading into the match, which was certainly a possibility given his lack of competitive action. Sharing his take on the match, journalist Jon Wertheim noted: “I would say he could not ask for anything more. “When we learned about the terms of his ban I think a lot of people said well he is not going to miss a major. “Other people said not only that but he gets to come back for Rome. He is an Italian player, he got a nice reception, and I think that is part of this as well. “This was an easy, hospitable way to rejoin the tour and he did not look like a guy whose last match was the Australian Open final.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Canada's Bianca Andreescu returns a shot to Italy's Jasmine Paolini during a first-round match of the U.S. Open tennis championships, Tuesday, Aug. 27, 2024, in New York. ROME - Canada's Bianca Andreescu is through to the fourth round of the Italian Open WTA 1000 tennis tournament after posting a 6-2, 6-4 victory over No. 11 seed Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan on Sunday. Andreescu, a 24-year-old from Mississauga, Ont., converted three break points and saved five to win the third-round match in one hour 27 minutes. Currently ranked 121st, Andreescu earned her first win against a top-20 opponent since 2023 on Friday with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-2 victory against Donna Vekic of Croatia in the second round. Rybakina hadn't dropped a set in three previous meetings with Andreescu, including a win in the second round of the Madrid Open last month. Andreescu will play the winner of a match between No. 26 Magdalena Frech in the next round. Kostyuk hit five aces and converted four break points, compared to one for Fernandez, en route to victory.

Holger Rune collapsed completely on Sunday afternoon and is out of the ATP 1000 tournament in Rome after a marathon match in three sets against French Corentin Moutet.

In a match that lasted a grueling three hours and 46 minutes in the baking Italian sun, the Dane was in the end forced to surrender against the Frenchman losing 7-5, 5-7, 7-6.

The Danish tennis superstar, who is number ten in the world rankings, went into the match as big favorite against the Frenchman, who is ranked as world number 83.

Even so, the French had the necessary power to dominate most baseline duels in a first set in which he prevailed 7-5, before Rune gradually seemed to recover his gameplan in the second set which he won 7-5

Thus, the match had to be decided in the third set, which, like the previous two, had to be decided in a virtual nail-biter.

The match was characterized by far too many Danish mistakes, and a staggering eight double faults from Holger Rune proved decisive.

Holger Rune is usually a specialist in decisive tiebreakers but it didn't work out for the Dane this time as he lost 7-4 and is thus out of one of the big warmup tournaments for the French Open in June. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nick Kyrgios looks set to make what may be a final appearance at Wimbledon this summer and he could also make a rare appearance at the French Open later this month. Aussie maverick Kyrgios has struggled with injuries since his run to the 2022 Wimbledon final and he has given several hints that he will quit tennis. Yet he also hinted at the start of 2025 that he would have a final shot of making a run at his favourite tournament at Wimbledon, where he lost in the 2022 final against Novak Djokovic. “For me, obviously this year I've been out for a year and a half, two years, so I don't know what this year's going to bring,” he said after struggling with injuries as he was beaten in his opening match at the Australian Open in January. When did Nick Kyrgios last play at the French Open? Why trophies and rankings are not always a gauge of victory “For me personally, I couldn't see myself playing more than probably this year high-level singles anymore. A fully fit Kyrgios could be a threat on grass courts, but former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash told Tennis365 that his fellow Aussie will struggle to come back to the top of the game after so long on the sidelines with injuries. “He's been out for two years and that's a long time. “Over three sets, he will probably be okay to do it, but can he do it over five sets in a Grand Slam? There's nothing worse than being injured and I have known enough about that in my career. “The talent is there, but you would question the physical side of it in longer matches when you have been out for so long.” Kyrgios has given a big hint that he will also look to play the French Open later this month, after confirming he is practising on clay courts. He has been damning about his views of clay court tennis in recent years, but it appears he is ready to try his luck for one last time at Roland Garros after posting a message on his social media platform confirming he is preparing to play in Paris later this month. Kyrgios could enter the tournament using his protected ranking that is given to players who have been out of action for an extended period due to injury.

Venus Williams and Andre Agassi headline a star-studded line-up for TNT Sports and their French Open coverage later this month.

The seven-time Grand Slam champion has not played a competitive match in over a year, though she is yet to announce her retirement from the sport.

But the American will now form part of TNT Sports' coverage in the first year of a 10-year deal to cover the French Open, following a bumper $650m (£490m) deal signed last year between Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), the owner of TNT Sports, and the French Tennis Federation (FFT).

Williams will be joined by Agassi, and fellow Hall of Famers John McEnroe, Lindsay Davenport, Jim Courier, Chris Evert, Mats Wilander and Boris Becker as hosts, commentators and contributors.

The broadcaster states that Williams will contribute “special features” to the coverage in its inaugural UK and U.S coverage for Roland-Garros.

More talent comes in the shape of CoCo Vandeweghe, who won the 2018 US Open women's doubles title, Sam Querrey, the 10-time ATP singles champion and co-host of popular podcast ‘Nothing Major'.

While Sloane Stephens, a Roland-Garros singles finalist in 2018, and Chris Eubanks, still active on the ATP Tour, will also feature throughout the fortnight.

British fans can look forward to familiar faces Tim Henman and Laura Robson, with commentators Nick Mullins, Naomi Cavaday, Anne Keothavong and Miles Maclagan and presenters Rachel Stringer, Lesly Boitrelle and Craig Doyle.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sinner plays his first match since winning the Australian Open in January At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. He is now raring to return at his home tournament in Rome as he looks to build towards the next grand slam at the French Open later this month. After receiving Sinner a bye to the second round as top seed, he will be welcomed back by Argentine player Mariano Navone in his opening match of the tournament, who beat Sinner's countryman Federico Cina in straight sets in the first round. Follow all the build-up and action from Sinner's return below: It's clay-court season, meaning we are well on the road to Roland Garros. Last Sunday, most eyes in the tennis world were on Madrid as Jack Draper and Casper Ruud faced off for the Masters 1000 trophy. But 4 May was also remarkable for being the final day of world No 1 Jannik Sinner's suspension. Flo Clifford delves into Sinner's doping saga and his return to action: Jannik Sinner has not been the only tennis star to be embroiled in a doping case as of late. Australia's two-time Grand Slam doubles champion Max Purcell has accepted an 18-month ban after breaching anti-doping rules. Jack Draper publicly backed Jannik Sinner as the Italian prepares to make his return from a three-month doping suspension, saying he “doesn't deserve any hate”. “I think Jannik is a really, really genuine, nice person,” Draper, a personal friend of Sinner's, told The Guardian and BBC Sport ahead of his own return to action at the Madrid Open last month. “And on top of that, he's obviously an unbelievable player. In this situation, I'm sure that he would have absolutely zero idea of anything. That's just the way life goes – sometimes there's mistakes. “In terms of actually how I feel about him as a person, I think it's important for people to know and recognise that the guy's very, very kind-hearted and a good human being. Serena Williams expressed surprise over the length of Jannik Sinner's ban from tennis, joking that she would have been stripped of her grand slam titles had she failed a drugs test. I would have gotten grand slams taken away from me.” Jannik Sinner revealed he considered quitting tennis before accepting a three-month doping ban. “I remember before the Australian Open this year, I was not in a very happy moment because there was still that case of doping. Emma Raducanu and Jack Draper coasted into Italian Open third round yesterday, with both storming to straight-sets victories over Jil Teichmann and Luciano Darderi respectively. There was no such luck for Cameron Norrie, however, who had no answers for 10th seed Daniil Medvedev as he was knocked out in the second round. Jacob Fearnley, meanwhile, was knocked out by home favourite Matteo Berrettini this morning. Jannik Sinner revealed he received some “surprising messages” from fellow players during his three-month doping ban, with the World No 1 also admitting he was surprised by the players who did not reach out. “Whereas there were others who I would have expected to hear from that didn't send anything. While Sinner admitted “partial responsibility” for the mistakes made by his team that led to him twice positive for traces of clostebol, WADA withdrew its appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) that asked for a ban of up to two years following the initial decision by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) not to suspend him. Should Sinner progress past Navone, he could potentially face Spain's Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in the third round and Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo in round four. His projected quarter-final opponent is Madrid Open champion and two-time French Open runner-up Casper Ruud while Sinner is in a different half of the draw to Alcaraz, who is seeded third, behind World No 2 Alexander Zverev.
