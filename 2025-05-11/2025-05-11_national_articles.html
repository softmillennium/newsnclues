                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• China trade talks: Top US officials touted “substantial progress” and indicated a deal may have been made with China during negotiations this weekend in Switzerland, after President Donald Trump's tariffs sparked a trade war between the world's largest economies. • Ukraine peace effort: President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was ready to meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin this week, shortly after Trump urged him to accept Moscow's invitation for direct peace talks in Turkey. • Luxe new Air Force One: During Trump's trip to the Middle East this week, his administration is expected to accept a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family to be retrofitted and used as Air Force One, sources told CNN, in an unprecedented move that raises major ethical and legal questions. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett reiterated comments from recent days that the United States has “about 24 trade deals” in the works. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are working together on the deals, Hassett said today on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo.” The discussions are an effort to solidify deals during President Donald Trump's 90-day pause on his so-called reciprocal tariffs. “(The trade deals) all look a little bit like the UK deal, but each one is bespoke,” Hassett said, referring to a broad agreement struck with British negotiators last week. Hassett did not specify which countries the United States may have deals with. On Friday, he told CNBC that about 24 deals “are this close to being resolved” and the deals are “going to be very settling for markets.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he is prepared to meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin for talks in Turkey this week, in what would be their first meeting since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion. Zelensky said a “full and lasting ceasefire” starting Monday would provide “the necessary basis for diplomacy,” but did not specify that this would be a precondition for attending the talks. “We await a full and lasting ceasefire, starting from tomorrow, to provide the necessary basis for diplomacy. There is no point in prolonging the killings,” Zelensky wrote today on X. “And I will be waiting for Putin in Türkiye on Thursday. I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses.” How we got here: Zelensky's message came less than an hour after US President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social that Ukraine should “immediately” agree to meet with Russian officials on Thursday. Trump's comments undermined efforts by Kyiv's European allies to pressure Putin with an ultimatum: agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine by Monday or face “massive” new sanctions. European leaders have been steadfast this weekend in demanding that Putin agree to the ceasefire before any direct talks take place. Trump added that he's “starting to doubt” Ukraine will make a deal with Putin. Trump, meanwhile, has increasingly engaged in the Ukraine peace efforts on a separate track from his traditional European allies. In a late-night address Saturday, Putin did not acknowledge the ceasefire offer. Instead, he proposed holding the direct talks with Kyiv in Turkey — something not seen since the early weeks of Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022. European leaders were quick to publicly reject Putin's counter-offer, and Keith Kellogg — Trump's special envoy to Ukraine — had indicated he was aligned with the Europeans before Trump spoke out today on social media. The Trump administration is set to accept a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family, which will be retrofitted and used as Air Force One during his second term, two people familiar with the agreement told CNN. The announcement is expected to happen within a matter of days. Trump embarks this week on the first major foreign trip of his second term, which will includes a stop in Doha. Trump and aides toured the plane earlier this year in Palm Beach, and it is expected to be in use within two years, one person told CNN. Since his tour, Trump has boasted to people around him about how luxurious the plane was. This comes after the president was deeply frustrated by delays in new aircraft to be used as Air Force One. He at one point tasked Elon Musk with helping accelerate the process. Top US officials involved in high-level trade negotiations with China emerged from two days of talks touting “substantial progress” and appearing to confirm that a deal between the two countries had been reached, which could have massive implications for the global economy. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer indicated an agreement had been reached after President Donald Trump imposed sweeping 145% tariffs on most Chinese goods last month. “The president declared a national emergency and imposed tariffs, and we're confident that the deal we struck with our Chinese partners will help us to resolve work toward resolving that national emergency,” Greer said. Ahead of the talks, Trump administration officials had downplayed expectations that a deal would be reached this weekend. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has denied cuts made by the Department of Government Efficiency have impacted air safety. Air traffic controllers were not included in the DOGE cuts earlier this year, but some staff who maintain infrastructure for the Federal Aviation Administration were. Duffy said on NBC's “Meet the Press” today that while there was a “broader conversation about which positions are going to be preserved,” he was never asked to cut air traffic controllers, who have long been in short supply. He also emphasized that the FAA cuts were made to probationary workers. “It was the new employees that we were gonna let go. Air safety in the US: The transportation secretary was asked to address safety concerns at Newark Airport, where air traffic controllers face critical staffing shortages and repeat equipment outages — including the loss of radar for about 90 seconds on Friday, and more equipment issues that ground flights to a halt this morning. Today's high-stakes nuclear talks between US and Iranian officials in Oman have concluded, a senior Trump administration official said, casting the latest discussions as encouraging. In a positive sign ahead of Trump's first major trip of his second term to the Middle East, the two sides plan to “move forward” on more technical topics soon, according to the official, though a date has not yet been set. “We are encouraged by today's outcome and look forward to our next meeting, which will happen in the near future,” the official said. This post has been updated with comments from Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will travel to the Middle East this week, joining President Donald Trump in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, according to the State Department. CNN's Alayna Treene and Kristen Holmes contributed to this report. “A very good meeting today with China, in Switzerland. Setting expectations: Trump's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is leading the US delegation, urged the public earlier this week not to expect a major trade deal out of the meetings, instead characterizing them as an opportunity to establish a constructive tone and agree on some basic principles. “However, an ultimate solution requires sufficient strategic patience and determination, as well as the just support of the international community,” Xinhua said. How we got here: The US has placed a minimum 145% tariff on most Chinese imports, and China has responded with a 125% tariff on most US imports. As a result, trade between the two sides is falling sharply, according to logistics experts. Even reducing that tariff rate by half might not be enough to change trade levels significantly. And the combination of fewer goods arriving in the US and increased costs on imports that do arrive has already started pushing up prices for Americans. Hours after Bessent set off for Switzerland on Friday, Trump floated the possibility of slashing tariffs on Chinese goods to 80% while demanding China “open up its market to USA.” A fourth round of talks between the US and Iran on Tehran's nuclear program has begun in Oman today, according to Iranian state media, with the two sides aiming to overcome divisions that could dash the tentative negotiations. Each side is drawing a line: Both countries have expressed a willingness to resolve their disputes through diplomacy, but a central issue remains Iran's demand to continue enriching uranium for its nuclear program, which it insists is peaceful. The US has called uranium enrichment a “red line.” President Donald Trump, who is headed to the Middle East next week, has threatened that the US would resort to military strikes against Iranian nuclear sites, with Israel's help, should Tehran fail to reach a deal with its interlocutors. US special envoy Steve Witkoff, who has been heading the American side, warned that if this session of talks were not productive, “then they won't continue and we'll have to take a different route.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Top US officials involved in high-level trade negotiations with China emerged from two days of talks touting “substantial progress” and appearing to confirm that a deal between the two countries had been reached, which could have massive implications for the global economy. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer indicated that an agreement had been reached Sunday, after President Donald Trump imposed sweeping 145% tariffs on most Chinese goods last month. “The president declared a national emergency and imposed tariffs, and we're confident that the deal we struck with our Chinese partners will help us to resolve work toward resolving that national emergency,” Greer said. live updates Trump's presidency: US officials tout progress in China trade talks Ahead of the talks, Trump administration officials downplayed expectations that a deal would be reached this weekend, characterizing the meetings as a good first step. Bessent had suggested last week that his goal was de-escalation of tensions, as the US and China have been at a virtual stalemate since Trump imposed his tariff policy. Bessent said he and Greer, who did not take questions from the press, have briefed Trump, who he described as “fully informed.” The White House later clarified that China also needed to make concessions. The weekend talks marked a significant step toward thawing US-China trade relations. The current 145% tariff rate has sent shipments from China into the United States plunging by 60%, according to Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, a logistics and freight forwarding broker. Even reducing that tariff rate by half might not be enough to change trade levels significantly. The combination of fewer goods coming in and increased costs on imports that do arrive has already started pushing up prices for Americans. Goldman Sachs analysts said Thursday that a key measure of inflation would effectively double to 4% by the year's end because of Trump's trade war. And with ships carrying goods under the 145% tariffs now coming into port, a trade deal wouldn't lower prices immediately. To say Americans depend on a wide range of Chinese goods understates how pervasive those goods have become in all our lives. Footwear, clothes, appliances, microchips, baby goods, toys, sports equipment, office machine parts and much more all pour into the United States from China in staggering numbers. Chinese outbound shipments to the US stood at $33 billion last month — a whopping 21% decline from the $41.8 billion recorded in April 2024, according to CNN's calculation. Steep US tariffs also took a heavy toll on China's manufacturing sector. Chinese factory activity contracted at its fastest pace in 16 months in April, adding urgency to Beijing's efforts to roll out fresh economic stimulus. The news that Bessent and Greer would meet their Chinese counterparts in Geneva raised hopes of a thaw between the two nations. Trump also told a conservative radio host on Wednesday that he would raise the case of jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai “as part of the negotiation.” Lai, a pugnacious former publisher whose now-shuttered tabloid Apple Daily was a regular thorn in Beijing's side, is in the midst of a national security trial that could send him to prison for life. It's unclear whether US officials brought up Lai in talks with their Chinese counterparts. CNN's David Goldman and Nathaniel Meyersohn contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's new presidential plane could be flying in the skies soon as his administration is set to accept a super luxury Boeing jet as a gift from Qatar. In February, Trump revealed the White House was looking at a number of alternative options to replace dated Air Force One jets, including “getting” a used aircraft from overseas and converting it to become his presidential airplane. The president criticized Boeing, whose contract to construct a pair of Air Force One replacement jets fell far behind schedule and went over budget after multiple setbacks. “This isn't a good idea even if the plane was being donated to the U.S. government,” Murphy wrote on X. It's simply a cash payment to Trump in exchange for favors. Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) called on the House Oversight Committee to “aggressively investigate now.” Trump toured the plane that was once used by the Qatari royal government in February while it was parked at the West Palm Beach International Airport in Florida. Afterward, the president kept details about plans to acquire the jet scant, telling reporters he was unhappy that Boeing was taking so long to finish the promised Air Force One replacements. “I'm not happy with the fact that it's taking so long, and we may do something else,” he said. Earlier this month, further specifics were revealed when the White House reportedly commissioned defense company L3Harris to refurbish Qatar's Boeing 747.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Explosions rocked several parts of Kashmir hours after the truce was announced on Saturday, but both countries have reiterated their commitment to the agreement. • Long-running conflict: Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan each control parts of Kashmir but claim it in full and have fought three wars over the territory. “Their planes were prevented from coming inside our border so we do not have the wreckage with us but definitely we have downed a few planes,” India's Director General of Military Operations (DMGO) Rajiv Ghai said in a briefing Sunday. According to Ghai, “over 100 terrorists were killed by Indian operations.” Pakistan has previously claimed to have shot down five Indian jets. However, he welcomed the cessation in hostilities and said it offered both sides a “privilege.” He told CNN that India had not respected ceasefires in previous conflicts. Despite accusations of violations from both sides, the truce announced Saturday appears to be holding. After initial accusations of violations, a ceasefire between India and Pakistan appears to be holding on Sunday. Pope Leo XIV welcomed the ceasefire between India and Pakistan in his first Sunday address, which also saw him appeal for peace in Ukraine and Gaza. “I welcomed the announcement of the ceasefire between India and Pakistan and I hope that through negotiations we can reach a lasting agreement,” he said. Addressing an event on Sunday, Defense Minister Rajnath Singh said that the terrorists who had killed 26 people in Indian-administered Kashmir last month and “erased the sindoor of many families had now been brought to justice.” The word ‘sindoor' is a reference to the red vermilion, or powder, that many Hindu women wear on their foreheads after marriage and is a symbolic nod to the killings in April, which left several women widowed. Singh said that India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, had sent a clear message that India will carry out “impactful action” against terrorism, “whether it is on this side of the border or across the border.” The 26 killed at a scenic mountain spot in Indian-administered Kashmir were mostly Indian tourists. After launching its first strikes against Islamabad on Wednesday, New Delhi said it was targeting “terrorist infrastructure” in the country. The Indian Air Force said Sunday that its military operation against Pakistan had been “successfully executed” but was “still ongoing.” “Since the Operations are still ongoing, a detailed briefing will be conducted in due course.” Since the truce came into effect on Saturday at 5pm Indian time (730a ET) both sides have accused each other of ceasefire violations. India's foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, told a news conference on Saturday that there had been “repeated violations” of the agreement. There have been no fresh strikes or drone flights reported in Pakistan Sunday. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said Sunday that it appreciated the constructive role played by the US and other friendly states “in supporting the recent ceasefire understanding between Pakistan and India, a step towards de-escalation and regional stability.” “People are coming back to the village… there is hope finally that things will be better,” the student, who asked not to be named, told CNN. We are very happy and hopeful,” the resident said. Video showed markets reopening and people walking through the streets of several towns in India-administered Kashmir. Mohammed Tahir, a resident of Srinagar in India-administered Kashmir, told CNN the ceasefire “offers a window for stability” and that he hopes it holds. “Otherwise the current calm risks being a temporary respite,” he said. Deepika Pushkar Nath, a lawyer from Jammu, told CNN that on Saturday “everything was shut down and no-one was moving out, markets were closed.” It has been in force since 1960 and is regarded as a rare diplomatic success story between the two fractious neighbors. “There is no pre- or post-condition of the ceasefire. On Sunday, Pakistan's defense minister told Geo News that the water treaty was among its top priorities in discussions with India, as well as disputed Kashmir and “terrorism.” CNN has reached out to Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for further comment. US President Donald Trump said he is “proud” that Washington was able to help India and Pakistan reach an immediate ceasefire, and said he would increase trade “substantially” with both countries. “I am proud that the USA was able to help you arrive at this historic and heroic decision,” he wrote. India has downplayed US involvement, with its Ministry of Information saying the agreement was worked out “directly between the two countries,” but Pakistani officials have heaped praise on Washington. “We thank President Trump for his leadership and proactive role for peace in the region,” said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday. In his post, Trump went on to say: “While not even discussed, I am going to increase trade, substantially, with both of these great Nations.” And he pledged to see if a solution could be reached on the Kashmir dispute, writing: “I will work with you both to see if, after a ‘thousand years,' a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir.” China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke with top officials from India and Pakistan on Saturday, shortly before a ceasefire was reached between Islamabad and New Delhi to bring an end to the dangerous spiral of tit-for-tat strikes, Beijing's foreign ministry said. Pakistan and India agreed to an immediate ceasefire later Saturday, unexpectedly halting the spiral of retaliatory military operations triggered by last month's massacre of tourists in Pahalgam in India-administered Kashmir. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said his forces “made military history” in their fight against India after the two sides reached a ceasefire agreement on Saturday. In a televised address late Saturday night local time, the leader did not address reports of explosions in Kashmir or respond to allegations from India's foreign secretary, who accused Pakistan of violating the countries' nascent truce. Instead, he focused on applauding Pakistan's military response and expressing gratitude for his country's allies. “In recent days what the enemy has done was shameful and cowardly. “Our forces have been rewarded with the most magnificent honor and pride,” Sharif said as he thanked Pakistan's military leadership. “Violation of ceasefire agreement from our side is out of question,” Pakistan's Information Minister Attaullah Tarar told Pakistani news channel Geo News. “The people of Pakistan were celebrating their victory against India,” Tarar said. India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri accused Pakistan of repeatedly violating the ceasefire agreement on Saturday, after explosions were heard in both the India- and Pakistan-administered parts of Kashmir. “For the last few hours there have been repeated violations of the understanding arrived at earlier this evening between the directors general of military operations of India and Pakistan,” Misri said in a televised address Saturday night. “This is a breach of the understanding arrived at earlier today. Misri said India is calling on Pakistan to take “appropriate steps to address these violations and deal with the situation with seriousness and responsibility.” He added that India's military has been instructed to “deal strongly” with violations of the ceasefire along the border and the Line of Control in Kashmir. Pakistan has not yet publicly responded to Misri's allegations. Pakistan's prime minister is scheduled to speak late this evening local time. The sounds of multiple explosions were heard over Pakistan-administered Kashmir early Saturday evening local time. In videos shared with CNN from the Bhimber district, dozens of explosions can be heard reverberating through the sky in rapid bursts. Explosions on the Indian side: This comes after blasts rocked Srinagar in India-administered Kashmir earlier Saturday. Pakistan is prepared to engage in “constructive diplomacy” with India, the country's foreign ministry said today, adding that it wants to resolve all issues “including the Jammu and Kashmir Dispute, through peaceful means.” “Despite facing blatant Indian aggression and persistent provocations, Pakistan exercised great restraint. A core group of top US officials — including Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State and interim national security adviser Marco Rubio and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles — had been closely monitoring the escalating conflict between India and Pakistan when on Friday morning, the US received alarming intelligence, Trump administration officials told CNN. Vance himself would call Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But from the US perspective, Vance's call to Modi was a critical moment. Strong blasts were heard across the city of Srinagar in India-administered Kashmir just hours after a ceasefire was announced between India and Pakistan. Explosions heard across Srinagar,” Omar Abdullah, chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, said in a post on X. The explosions can be heard in this video posted by Abdullah: On his Truth Social platform, he made the surprise announcement that India and Pakistan had agreed to a “full and immediate” ceasefire — all the more unexpected as, just days before, Vice President JD Vance insisted the conflict was “fundamentally, none of our business.” But escalating attacks deep inside Indian and Pakistani territory seem to have focused minds. Just hours before, India had struck Pakistani military bases, provoking a furious retaliation from Pakistan, which launched rockets, artillery and drone strikes on dozens of locations in India. There are conflicting accounts of how the ceasefire was negotiated. It is in neither India's nor Pakistan's interest for the conflict, sparked by a terror attack in disputed Kashmir last month, to continue. The truce is also exactly the kind of quick deal Trump hoped he could secure elsewhere, such as in Ukraine, where conflict has been dragging on for nearly three and a half years. US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that the ceasefire reached between India and Pakistan was a result of several conversations between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance over the past 48 hours between top officials in each country. “It was a beautiful partnership,” Bruce said on News Nation. But a Pakistani government source familiar with the negotiations told CNN that the US — and Rubio in particular — played a crucial role in getting both sides to agree. “It's been a long 48 hours, but this is the point of what we do,” Bruce continued. “We look forward to hopefully managing more conversations and having this endure,” she added. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked US President Donald Trump for his role in brokering a ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan, as the two countries offer differing accounts on Washington's involvement in the talks. “We thank President Trump for his leadership and proactive role for peace in the region,” Sharif wrote on X, about three hours after Trump first announced the ceasefire. “Pakistan appreciates the United States for facilitating this outcome, which we have accepted in the interest of regional peace and stability,” Sharif said, adding that Saturday's agreement could beckon “a new beginning” for peace in the region. Sharif also thanked Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio for their “valuable contributions.” After an intense day of fighting that threatened to spiral out of control, India and Pakistan unexpectedly agreed to an immediate ceasefire, halting the worst fighting in decades between the nuclear-armed neighbors. Although the United States has claimed credit for the agreement, questions remain about how it was reached — and whether it will last. As a ceasefire was announced between India and Pakistan on Saturday, President Donald Trump hailed the role of the United States in mediating, and Pakistan praised it — but India downplayed it. In their long history of tensions, India and Pakistan have both viewed foreign intervention differently: “India has never accepted mediation in any dispute, be it India-Pakistan or India-China, or any other,” according to Aparna Pande, research fellow for India and South Asia at the Hudson Institute. “So yes, India welcomes international pressure on Pakistan, but it will never state that there was a role by any other country or international organization,” she said. “Pakistan, on the other hand, has always sought international mediation, so they will praise it,” she added, saying it is “the only way it can put pressure on India to discuss and resolve the Kashmir dispute.” After militants from Pakistan invaded, he signed a letter acceding to India. Pakistan did not recognize the letter as a legal document, sparking war. In 1949, the two countries agree to withdraw all troops behind a mutually agreed ceasefire line, later known as the Line of Control. Shock over strikes: The source said both sides were progressing toward an agreement on Friday, but said that Islamabad was blindsided by New Delhi's targeting three Pakistani air bases with air-to-surface missiles early Saturday morning local time. The source said that New Delhi had been shocked by the scale of Pakistan's response, and that both sides then “got serious” about engaging in peace talks later Saturday. US steps in: US Secretary of State Marco Rubio played a “monumental role” in mediating the discussions, according to the source, who said that officials from Saudi Arabia and Turkey were also involved. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy hailed the ceasefire announced by India and Pakistan as “hugely welcome.” Meanwhile, the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Issues Kaja Kallas said the announced ceasefire “is a vital step toward de-escalation.” She added: “All efforts must be made to ensure it is respected.” A spokesperson for Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) earlier said the country had closed its airspace to all air traffic — including civilian flights — starting at 3:15 a.m. local time on Saturday (6:15 p.m. Friday ET) until noon local time. According to the Indian statement, an agreement was reached after Pakistan's director general of military operations initiated a phone call Saturday afternoon local time. An Indian source had previously provided the same statement to CNN. On potential future talks: The Indian government also said there had been no decision reached to hold talks “on any other issue at any other place.” A readout from the US State Department had said Secretary of State Marco Rubio offered help to mediate “in order to avoid future conflicts,” and Rubio wrote on X that the two sides had agreed to “start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.” India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri has also said that the directors general of military operations of the two countries are scheduled to speak again on Monday. What Islamabad is saying: Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said in an X post shortly after Trump's announcement that “Pakistan and India have agreed to a ceasefire with immediate effect.” Rubio held a call with Dar as well. During a news conference, Misri said that Pakistan's Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) held a phone call with his Indian counterpart earlier on Saturday afternoon local time. During the call, it was agreed that both sides “would stop all firing and military action” from 5 p.m. Indian Standard Time. “The stoppage of firing and military action between India and Pakistan was worked out directly between the two countries,” a source said. They continued that Pakistan's director general of military operations (DGMO) initiated a call on Saturday afternoon local time, “after which discussions took place and understanding reached.” US President Donald Trump announced earlier on his Truth Social platform that the two sides had agreed to a “full and immediate ceasefire,” which was confirmed by Pakistan's foreign minister on X minutes later. Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said that Pakistan and India have agreed to a ceasefire “with immediate effect,” confirming US President Donald Trump's announcement on his Truth Social platform. “Pakistan has always strived for peace and security in the region, without compromising on its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Dar added, in a post on X. US Vice President JD Vance, who just days ago claimed the conflict between India and Pakistan was “none of our business,” has also shared President Donald Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed countries. “You know, America can't tell the Indians to lay down their arms. We can't tell the Pakistanis to lay down their arms. Vance shared a screenshot of Trump's Truth Social post announcing the ceasefire on Saturday, but did not immediately provide further comment. Pakistan's foreign minister and Indian sources confirmed the halt in fighting shortly after Trump's surprise announcement. “I am pleased to announce the Governments of India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire and to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site,” Rubio wrote Saturday on X, minutes after President Donald Trump first announced the ceasefire with a post on Truth Social. Rubio praised Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Shehbaz Sharif for “their wisdom, prudence, and statesmanship in choosing the path of peace.” India and Pakistan have agreed to a “full and immediate ceasefire” following a night of talks mediated by the US, President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Saturday. “After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE,” the US president said. “Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence.” Pakistan's Prime Minister said that retaliatory strikes against India on Saturday had specifically targeted military infrastructure New Delhi had used to launch its earlier attacks in “a powerful and well-coordinated response.” Earlier Saturday, Pakistan's military said it launched an operation against India, in retaliation to India launching missiles at key military bases, including one close to the capital Islamabad.Hours later, explosions were reported in India-administered Kashmir, including Srinagar, the region's largest city, and the city of Jammu. Pakistan launched the strikes on Saturday as part of ‘Operation Banyan al-Marsous,' Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif said in a statement issued by his office. The information minister for Pakistan-administered Kashmir said that 11 people were killed, including a child, and 56 others were injured in “intense” overnight Indian shelling along the Line of Control (LoC). “Last night, intense shelling from the Indian side took place at more than five different locations along the Line of Control,” Pir Mazhar Saeed Shah said Saturday. In Pakistan-administered Kashmir, Indian shelling has damaged 235 homes, 29 of which have been completely destroyed, Shah said. The latest confrontation between India and Pakistan continued Saturday, with Islamabad launching a military operation in retaliation to what it said were Indian strikes on its military bases overnight. India's military said it “effectively countered and responded” to Pakistan's operation. Witnesses have recounted the moment blasts were heard in Srinagar, India-controlled Kashmir's largest city, on Saturday morning. Local residents living near the city's airport told CNN they heard multiple blasts in their vicinity. I was at my home with family when we heard all this and were caught off guard,” 28-year-old Rafique Ahmed, who lives close to the airport, told CNN. Ahmed continued, “Earlier in the morning, I had heard around 5:45 a.m. there were sounds of blasts as well. “We are staying inside our house to be safe. “Multiple armed drones have been sent through the night, endangering civilians and religious sites,” India's defense ministry wrote in a statement on X. Residential areas in Jammu were also targeted, the statement said. Early Saturday, Pakistan said it launched an operation against India, in retaliation to India launching missiles at key military bases, including one close to the capital Islamabad. The Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir confirmed a government official, district development commissioner Raj Kumar Thappa, was killed in shelling on the city of Rajouri in India-administered Kashmir. “I've no words to express my shock & sadness at this terrible loss of life. India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri also confirmed Thappa's death, telling reporters in a news conference that his death added “to the civilian casualties and the damage in that state.” Pakistan and India launched retaliatory military operations on each other on Saturday, escalating the conflict further, after days of accusing each other of taking escalatory steps. Pakistan said its air defenses had intercepted most of India's missiles. Later, India's Wing Commander Vyomika Singh said Pakistan “targeted civilian areas and military infrastructure,” including medical and educational buildings in India-administered Kashmir, while speaking during the news briefing alongside other senior officials. Pakistan has not responded to comments made during the news briefing. The weeks-long confrontation between India and Pakistan escalated further on Saturday, with Islamabad launching a military operation in retaliation to what it said were Indian strikes on its military bases overnight. The nuclear-armed neighbors are now locked in their most expansive military conflict in decades, even as the international community calls for calm and restraint. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has offered Washington's help in mediating amid the escalations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio offered US mediation in the escalating conflict between Pakistan and India while speaking separately with his counterparts in both countries, according to State Department readouts. Pakistan's foreign minister said Saturday that if India stops its escalatory actions, so will Islamabad. “If there is an iota of sanity, India will stop and if they stop, so will we,” Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on camera while speaking with a local TV station. “We genuinely want peace without the hegemony of any one country,” Dar said. His comments come after India and Pakistan launched a fresh round of military operations on each other on Saturday and accused each other of taking escalatory steps. India says it “effectively countered and responded” to Pakistan's military operation early Saturday. Pakistan “targeted civilian areas and military infrastructure,” including medical and educational buildings in India-administered Kashmir, Wing Commander Vyomika Singh alleged, during a media briefing in New Delhi alongside other senior officials. Pakistan's military “also resorted to air intrusions using drones and firing of heavy caliber weapons” along the disputed border in Kashmir, Singh said. She added Pakistan used a high-speed missile to target an air base in Punjab state, inside India's undisputed borders. Pakistan's military “has been observed to be moving its troops towards forward areas, indicating an offensive intent to further escalation,” the Indian commander said. Pakistan has not responded to comments made during the news briefing. Earlier, Pakistan said it launched a retaliatory operation against India after India launched strikes on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, against what it called “terrorist infrastructure.” “China is closely following the current situation between India and Pakistan and is deeply concerned about the escalation,” a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday. China stands ready to continue playing a constructive role in this regard.” Some context: China, which borders both India and Pakistan, has repeatedly called for calm and restraint amid the looming risk of war on its doorstep. Its Foreign Ministry expressed regret and concern on Wednesday after India launched strikes on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, against what it called “terrorist infrastructure.” Late last month, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi expressed support for Pakistan in a phone call with his counterpart, calling China an “ironclad friend” of Pakistan's. Pakistan is Beijing's “all-weather strategic partner” and a key participant in Chinese leader Xi Jinping's signature global infrastructure project, the Belt and Road Initiative. The International Monetary Fund's executive board on Friday approved an approximately $1 billion loan disbursement to Pakistan, a relief for the country facing a lingering economic crisis and now an escalating conflict with India. The immediate disbursement comes as part of a $7 billion bailout Pakistan secured from the IMF after years of negotiations, according to a statement. The IMF also approved a new $1.4 billion under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility, its climate resilience fund — but those funds will not be released yet. While Pakistan had long been working to secure this deal, India asked the IMF for a broader review of its loans to Islamabad earlier this month, as the conflict heightened. Delhi's objection: India said it raised concerns at the IMF meeting Friday about “the possibility of misuse of debt financing funds for state sponsored cross border terrorism,” according to a press release from the Indian Ministry of Finance. Some context: The loan disbursement comes as Pakistan's economy has been suffering major challenges in recent years, including a debt crisis and economic turmoil as a result of political instability and climate catastrophes. A military stand-off with India would threaten any progress. “Sustained escalation in tensions with India would likely weigh on Pakistan's growth and hamper the government's ongoing fiscal consolidation, setting back Pakistan's progress in achieving macroeconomic stability,” credit agency Moody's said in a report earlier this week, according to the Reuters news agency. “A persistent increase in tensions could also impair Pakistan's access to external financing and pressure its foreign-exchange reserves,” it added. The escalating conflict between India and Pakistan has reached “alarming proportions,” one analyst has said, after Islamabad said it launched an operation against its neighbor in retaliation to recent “Indian aggression.” “This crisis has reached alarming proportions,” said Washington-based South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman, adding there seem to be “no immediate off-ramps in site.” Pakistan's military said early Saturday it had launched an operation against India in retaliation to India launching missiles at key military bases, including one close to the capital Islamabad. India and Pakistan have already fought three wars over Kashmir, a contested region they both claim in its entirety, with each controlling a part. “Each round of tit-for-tat strikes takes India and Pakistan further up the escalation ladder, but neither side appears willing to claim victory and call it a day,” said Kugelman. Explosions have been reported in India-administered Kashmir, hours after Pakistan said it launched a retaliatory military operation against its neighbor. At least two blasts were heard early Saturday in Srinagar, the largest city in India-administered Kashmir, a journalist on the ground told CNN. The Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir on Friday night appealed to people in and around the city of Jammu to stay at home. “It's my earnest appeal to everyone in & around Jammu please stay off the streets, stay at home or at the nearest place you can comfortably stay at for the next few hours,” Omar Abdullah wrote on X. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Pakistani army chief Asim Munir on Friday and offered US mediation, according to a State Department readout. India is currently responding to Pakistani attacks, an Indian official with knowledge of the matter told CNN's Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Matthew Chance. Pakistan's military claims it has hit multiple targets in India and India-administered Kashmir. Most of these locations are near or along the de facto border that divides the disputed Kashmir region between New Delhi and Islamabad. The Pakistan military said that, in an “eye for eye” retaliation, they targeted the Indian air bases that were used to launch missiles against Pakistan. CNN cannot independently verify Pakistan's claim regarding India's strikes. CNN has reached out to India's Ministry of Defense and the Indian Air Force for a response. The Pakistani military said it launched an operation against India on Saturday morning in retaliation to recent “Indian aggression.” The announcement came shortly after Pakistan said India had attacked several of its military air bases. CNN has reached out to India's Ministry of Defense and the Indian Air Force for a response. What Islamabad says about Indian strikes in Pakistani territory: CNN cannot independently verify the Pakistani military claim. The closure, which started at 3:15 a.m. local time (6.15 p.m. Friday EST), will apply to all civilian flights in the country until noon local time Saturday. The two nations to emerge from the bloody partition of British India — Muslim-majority Pakistan and Hindu-majority India — both claim Kashmir in full, and months after becoming independent, fought their first of three wars over the territory. After militants from Pakistan invade, he signs a letter acceding to India. Pakistan does not recognize the letter as a legal document, sparking war. In 1949, the two countries agree to withdraw all troops behind a mutually agreed ceasefire line, later known as the Line of Control. 1965: India and Pakistan go to war again over Kashmir. 1999: India and Pakistan fight a limited border conflict in Kashmir, after armed invaders from Pakistan cross the Line of Control in the town of Kargil. Here's what you need to know about the attack in Kashmir: At least 25 Indian citizens and one Nepali national were killed in the massacre, which unfolded in a valley only accessible by foot or on horseback. Eyewitnesses described scenes of horror as the gunmen approached, opening fire on people from close range. Who claimed responsibility: Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front (TRF), claimed responsibility for the attack on social media but it has reportedly since walked back that claim, according to multiple local media reports. India has not publicly blamed any group for the attack but has justified its retaliatory moves as a response to Pakistan's alleged “support for cross-border terrorism.” Some background: India has long accused Pakistan of harboring Islamist militant groups that target Kashmir, something Islamabad denies. India conducted air strikes inside Pakistan in 2019 following an insurgent attack on Indian soldiers. But attacks on tourists in the picturesque Himalayan region are rare. Tensions between India and Pakistan over Kashmir have surged in recent years, after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government revoked its constitutional autonomy in 2019, bringing it under the direct control of New Delhi. By the numbers, India's military would be seen as superior to Pakistan's in any conventional conflict. That budget supports an active-duty Indian force of almost 1.5 million personnel, compared to 660,000 for Pakistan. On the ground, India's 1.2 million-strong army has 3,750 main battle tanks and more than 10,000 artillery pieces, while Pakistan's tank force is only two-thirds of India's and Islamabad has fewer than half of the artillery pieces in New Delhi's arsenal. It also has only half the number of subs that India fields. Pakistan has added Chinese J-10 multirole jets, with more than 20 now in its fleet. Russian-made aircraft play a significant role in India's air fleet, with more than 100 MiG-29 fighters in service with the air force and navy combined, plus over 260 Su-30 ground attack jets. The rivals are closer in capabilities when it comes to nuclear forces, with around five dozen surface-to-surface launchers each, though Indian has longer-range ballistic missiles than Pakistan.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mónica got pregnant last year around the same time President Donald Trump was elected to a second term. And that is when her race against the calendar began. The Venezuelan national, who is in the United States legally but with temporary status, is terrified that Trump's long-promised effort to curb birthright citizenship will be allowed to take effect before her baby boy is due in August – an outcome that could effectively leave him stateless. “There's been a lot of fear,” the South Carolinian told CNN. “Every day it's a new restriction, and we don't know what will happen.” Mónica asked to be identified in this story by her first name because she is concerned about possible repercussions for speaking publicly about her situation. When the Supreme Court gathers Thursday to hear oral argument in a high-profile emergency appeal involving Trump's birthright citizenship order, the justices will technically be considering a procedural question about whether lower courts overstepped their authority by blocking the president's efforts nationwide. But the court's answer to that question will have enormous on-the-ground consequences, even for people – like Mónica – who are in the United States legally. Or the court could rule in a way that allows Trump to enforce the order against all but a handful of individuals. But a small group of legal conservatives have for years focused on a second phrase in the amendment's text, requiring people to be “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States before they become entitled to citizenship. People who owe their allegiance to another country, the argument goes, are not covered. Trump often chafed against birthright citizenship during his first term and campaigned heavily on the idea of ending it if he returned to power. “As a practical matter, I think the merits will to some degree have to be in the back of their minds,” said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University and close observer of the Supreme Court. She came to the United States in 2019 and benefits from a form of humanitarian relief known as temporary protected status. Trump's executive order, signed on January 20, blocks federal agencies from issuing documents recognizing citizenship for people born to noncitizen parents but also people in the country on a temporary basis. Multiple federal courts blocked its implementation nationwide, including one judge in Seattle nominated by President Ronald Reagan who described Trump's effort as “blatantly unconstitutional.” Maduro cut diplomatic ties with the United States in 2019. Even if she could reach an embassy in another country, Mónica said she wouldn't apply for a citizenship from a government her family is attempting to escape. “We left fleeing persecution,” Mónica said through an interpreter. In an unusual quirk of the case, Mónica will likely ultimately be able to obtain US citizenship for her son because she belongs to the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, a membership organization for people seeking asylum. The Trump administration has said in court papers it wants to enforce the order on a temporary basis against everyone except for certain members of ASAP, which is also representing Mónica, and another group. Meny, a native of Honduras who came to the United States with her husband and son in 2021, is in the same position. “I was already pregnant when I started to hear rumors that the president would likely be taking away birthright citizenship,” said Meny, a California resident who also asked to be identified by her first name only. “I remember thinking it was so scary that my son had not yet been born and that his rights would be violated.” Meny, who is seeking asylum in the United States, said she is concerned about the conversation she might need to have with her son someday about his status. “As a mom – as a parent – it would be very difficult for me to explain to him why he doesn't have those rights,” she said. That could mean blocking its enforcement in 22 blue states or, possibly, against a handful of individuals. The administration has described that as a “modest” request. Such a decision, if it offered further guidance or limitations on when district court judges could universally block a policy or law could have ramifications far beyond birthright citizenship. GianCarlo Canaparo, a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, noted that presidents of both parties – and both liberal and conservative justices – have raised concerns in recent years about the number of orders from federal judges that enjoin enforcement of a policy against not only the people who sued but everyone else in the nation. Those orders, known as nationwide or universal injunctions, have become common during the second Trump administration. “The argument that we need uniform laws is a policy judgment,” he said, “which is just historically not a permissible basis for courts to be granting remedies of different sizes and scope.” The court's decision effectively allowed Texas to enforce that six-week ban. The Supreme Court is expected to hear more than an hour of argument on Thursday and hand down a decision sometime before the end of June.</p>

The U.S. Marine Corps established an attack drone team earlier this year to respond to the rapid development of armed first-person view (FPV) drone technology and tactics, offering a glimpse into the evolving landscape of modern warfare and how future battles could be fought. The Marine Corps Attack Drone Team (MCADT) will be based at the Weapons Training Battalion, Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia. The FPV drones used will offer squad-level lethality at a range of up to 20 kilometers, nearly 12.5 miles, for under $5,000, compared to more expensive weapons systems with less capability, according to a press release from the service. "MCADT is committed to rapidly integrating armed first-person view drones into the FMF [Fleet Marine Force], enhancing small-unit lethality and providing organic capabilities that warfighters currently lack," said Maj. Alejandro Tavizon, the headquarters company commander at Weapons Training Battalion and officer in charge of MCADT. "By leveraging emerging technologies and refining drone employment tactics, we are ensuring that Marines remain agile, adaptive, and lethal in the modern battlespace." Brett Velicovich, an Army veteran with extensive drone experience, told Fox News Digital that the creation of MCADT has been long overdue as the United States enters a drone arms race with adversaries like China, Russia and Iran. "For a while now, we haven't had the needed technology, the needed expertise in low-cost, highly scalable, lethal drone technology that, frankly, is going to be the next part of every piece of the next war that we fight," he said. Velicovich argued that the United States is far behind other countries, especially China, when it comes to the production of drone technology, and needs to start looking at drones not just as surveillance assets, but as a form of ammunition. He pointed to Russia's war in Ukraine and the large-scale advancements in domestic drone production that have allowed Ukrainian forces to strike multi-million-dollar enemy tanks and vehicles with drones that cost a few hundred dollars. KYIV, UKRAINE - 2025/04/01: A batch of fibre optic controlled First Person View (FPV) drones are seen before being handed over to the Ukrainian armed forces. FPV drones equipped with fiber optics offer key advantages over traditional UAVs. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced in December that Ukraine manufactured over 1.5 million FPV drones in 2024, including reconnaissance, kamikaze and long-range deep-strike drones. Domestically produced drones accounted for 96.2% of all unmanned aerial vehicles used by Ukrainian forces during the year. "You have companies and manufacturing plants in Ukraine building 100,000 drones per month. One manufacturing plant is building 100,000 of these things per month. That's where we need to be," Velicovich told Fox News Digital. The number is far below what the United States' adversaries, such as Russia and China, produce in a year, raising national security concerns. Russian President Vladimir Putin, speaking at a meeting of the Military-Industrial Commission in late April, said that almost all of the country's defense enterprises had met their orders in full last year, highlighting Moscow's efforts to ramp up its war machine. "Over 1.5 million drones of various types were delivered, with about 4,000 so-called FPV drones equipped with virtual reality control systems supplied to the frontlines daily," Putin said, according to a transcript released by the Kremlin. "I know well, just as many of you here do, that these weapons are still in short supply. In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia's President Vladimir Putin chairs a Security Council meeting via videoconference at the Kremlin in Moscow on March 28, 2025. Chinese technology company DJI is also making significant inroads in drone production, in both U.S. and Asian markets. It touts itself as the world's leading manufacturer of consumer and commercial drones. "That's alarming, because DJI drones are essentially data collectors for Beijing — giving China potential access to sensitive infrastructure imagery, flight patterns, and more. Visitors view DJI drones at the World Intelligent Manufacturing Expo 2024 in Nanjing, China, on December 20, 2024. Singleton added that the U.S. doesn't need to match China drone for drone, but it needs a production floor that's sustainable, somewhere around a minimum of 250,000 drones per year. "We are absolutely in a drone arms race with China — and losing isn't an option. Success will depend on scaling production, protecting sensitive supply chains, and turbocharging innovation," he said. "It's not just about building drones — it's about fielding smarter, cheaper and more resilient swarms faster than Beijing." Ashley Carnahan is a writer at Fox News Digital.

But your body's aging isn't as simple as turning the pages on a calendar: Depending on who you are and how you live, different parts of your body can age more quickly or slowly than. And it turns out this other kind of aging, biological aging, matters more for your health than the number of candles on your birthday cake. In Super Agers, Topol points to a “metric revolution” in which blood-based proteomic clocks and DNA-methylation scores can pinpoint which organ system is aging the fastest, and by how many years. A 2024 Nature Medicine study used machine learning to examine more than 200 plasma proteins in thousands of people and showed that the resulting biological age forecasted 18 major diseases and all-cause mortality better than any single risk factor, like blood pressure or body mass. “When you particularize risk to a person, the chance of them taking actions to mitigate it is much, much higher,” Topol said. It's one thing to know generally that as you get older, you need to be aware of the risks of heart disease or neurodegenerative diseases. Down the line, scientists at the University of Washington are developing a multi-organ biological clock that will be developed into a digital app. Atkins, South Beach, Paleo, Zone — you'd be forgiven for throwing up your hands and just ordering takeout from DoorDash. But we do know what you eat is key to how well and how long you'll live, and the current American diet, heavy on ultra-processed foods and red meat, isn't cutting it. “Our diet is basically inviting disease instead of preventing it., Topol said. A 30-year study looked at 105,000 adults and found that of the one in 10 study subjects who reached age 70 without cancer, cardiac disease, or serious cognitive decline, virtually all scored high on an eating index that closely tracks Mediterranean-style diets. That means plenty of whole grains, vegetables, olive oil, and omega-rich seafood. You should also try to cut out sugars and ultraprocessed foods as much as possible, and go very easy on red meat, which Topol notes can trigger aging-accelerating inflammation. What you can do: Start by something as simple as swapping out butter for olive oil and soda for sparkling water. At this point, I think everyone knows just how important it is to get a good night's sleep. “If you don't get it, you're much more subject to brain aging and the three major diseases of aging.” Research has shown that people who get fewer hours of deep sleep per night have a greater risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases like dementia, while a larger amount of deep sleep can act as a protection against Alzheimer's-related memory loss. What you can do: During the writing of Super Agers, Topol increased his own deep sleep from around 15 minutes per night to over an hour by adhering to a consistent sleep schedule and tracking his progress with wearables. And steer clear of drugs and supplements, which are unlikely to help you get the deep, restorative slumber you need. As a cardiologist, Topol was long focused on aerobic exercise, which helps build up the cardiovascular system. “Now we know that strength and core training are equally important.” One meta-analysis from 2022 found that just an hour of resistance training per week lowered all-cause mortality by as much as 25 percent. And beyond trying to reduce the chance of death, strength training when you're younger helps build up muscle mass, slowing down the inevitable decline of muscle that occurs as you age. What you can do: You don't have to start pumping iron like 1970s Arnold Schwarzenegger to get the anti-aging benefits of strength training. It may seem inevitable that as you age, your social circle and connections shrink. “The strong data for social isolation shows it will compromise healthy aging,” Topol said. A 2023 meta-analysis linked social isolation to a 32 percent higher risk of all-cause mortality, while self-reported loneliness specifically tacked on another 14 percent. Neuro-imaging studies have even shown a biological effect from being alone, demonstrating spikes in inflammatory cytokines and the shrinkage of hippocampal volume in the brain. Schedule regular face time with a friend, and ideally do it outside: Frequent time in nature has been associated with reduced epigenetic aging. There's plenty more in Super Agers, including Topol's optimism around GLP-1 inhibitors like Ozempic, which have been showing the ability to reduce the risk of diseases of aging like dementia. But you don't need cutting-edge medicines to live a longer, healthier life. A version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite its reputation as ironclad, it was possible to escape Alcatraz. All it took was brains, guts and 50 raincoats. On June 11, 1962, three prisoners – Frank Morris and brothers Clarence and John Anglin, all in their 30s – shimmied with a homemade raft through hidden holes in their cell walls, climbed through a ventilation duct onto the roof and bolted from the island fortress into the freezing, choppy waters of the San Francisco Bay. The notion that the island prison is truly escape-proof is a key part of President Donald Trump's proposal to reopen it more than 60 years after the Bureau of Prisons closed it for being too expensive to operate. “Nobody's ever escaped from Alcatraz,” Trump asserted Monday in the Oval Office. But while Morris and the Anglin brothers were never found, fans of outlaw drama – and some of the prisoners' own family members – are convinced they actually made it to shore and lived out their lives hidden from justice and the public eye. “That case,” said Art Roderick, a retired US marshal involved in the investigation for nearly 40 years, “just never goes away.” Morris and the Anglins ended up in America's most foreboding prison for the most obvious reason: They were constantly trying to escape every other place they had been held, rap sheets in their FBI files show. “Well, they didn't like being locked up,” said David Widner, 58, who has cowritten a book about his uncles' breakout. The FBI documents show more than two dozen charges combined for the two brothers – who grew up in rural Georgia with a dozen other brothers and sisters – mostly for burglary and breaking and entering. “A lot of it was just so they would have nice things,” Widner said. Trump wants to reopen one of America's most notorious prisons. Clarence and John's last theft was of a tiny bank in Columbia, Alabama, the records show. They were arrested five days later – along with their older brother Alfred – on the run in Ohio, netting them 15-year federal prison sentences. Prison officials said Clarence tried to get out – with John's help – by hiding inside two large metal breadboxes. As children, the boys once figured out how to reuse a punctured tire by packing the hole full of moss, Widner told CNN. Based on the evidence they could gather, along with testimony from inmate Allen West – who was part of the conspiracy but said the three escapees left without him that night in 1962 – the Federal Bureau of Investigation pieced together an extraordinary plot accomplished slowly over six months: “My mom and the brothers and sisters always said they were the modern-day MacGyvers,” Widner remembered, recalling the TV show about a technical genius who uses found objects to construct whatever he needs to get out of tricky situations. “They could take nothing and make something out of it.” Investigators agreed, according to an FBI case memo filed three days after the escape. Plans were already underway to decommission the extraordinarily costly prison, according to Roderick, with Warden Olin Blackwell telling reporters it would take $5 million to get Alcatraz in proper condition, the equivalent today of $53 million. Investigators found the men punched out holes in their cell walls by drilling them over weeks and covering their work with painted cardboard, FBI records show. But, somehow, they all seemed to go nowhere. “I have never in my life come across a case that has more of those types of leads,” Roderick said. A hundred soldiers and 35 military police combed Angel Island, the spot just north of Alcatraz where West told investigators the men planned to go. “No evidence was found to indicate the Escapees ever reached this island,” an FBI report says. “We didn't have cable news, but you had all the media very fascinated with this case.” But it did not wash up on shore. The postcard addressed to “Warden, Alcatraz Prison” turned up June 18, signed “Frank, Jim, Clarence,” each in a different hand. There were not enough handwriting samples of John and Frank to make a comparison, and the FBI concluded the card was probably a hoax inspired by the intense and worldwide news coverage. Within days, searchers skimming the waters near Alcatraz Island, with its crystal-clear view of the Golden Gate Bridge, found sparse evidence related to the escape, including a portion of one of their improvised oars and part of a homemade life jacket, FBI records show. The government files contain dozens of contacts from people who said they may have seen the prisoners, but none ever panned out. “I trust our (San Francisco) Office isn't giving (a) ‘blow by blow' account to the press nor anyone else,” Hoover said in a June 13 memo. Widner's first encounter with his uncles' story came in 1977, when four men from the FBI visited his home and asked his mother Marie if she had any information about where her brothers, Clarence and John Anglin, ended up, he said. “They are presumed to be dead,” a 1979 memo stated. But the Marshals Service, which is responsible for capturing fugitives, has never closed its file. “There have been actionable leads that have come in,” said Roderick, the retired marshal who continues to consult on the case. (Discovery and CNN share the same parent company.) A decade later, Dutch scientists using computer models of currents in the Bay found the brothers and Morris could have made it safely to the Golden Gate Bridge area if they had left between 11 p.m. and midnight. The changing tides would then have sent any debris related to their trek back toward Angel Island, the researchers found. “We don't know how good they were at paddling, but I suppose if you ever have energy to spare, it would be in that situation,” said study co-author Rolf Hut at the Delft University of Technology. In 2013, the FBI got a letter that claimed to be from John Anglin, CNN affiliate KPIX reported. The writer said he would be willing to turn himself in if he was publicly promised cancer treatment and a one-year prison sentence. Even relatives who believe the inmates survived their escape acknowledge the men – who would now all be in their 90s – are almost certainly no longer around to be found. “They either died in the Bay or are dead by now,” Roderick said. The dramatic 1962 disappearance – which inspired the 1979 Clint Eastwood movie, “Escape from Alcatraz” – seemed to harden the resolve of then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy that Alcatraz had outlived its usefulness, telling reporters he was committing to closing it. “Kennedy does not agree with the view that Alcatraz should be retained as a deterent (sic) to hardened criminals in that other institutions could fill the same role at less expense,” stated an FBI memo, citing a story in the San Francisco Chronicle. Alcatraz was shuttered for good the following year, remaining dormant until the National Park Service began converting it into a museum in 1972. Since then, the former lockup has attracted more than a million visitors a year, one of the most popular National Park sites, according to the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy. “It represents something strong, very powerful in terms of law and order. Widner, the Anglins' nephew, has visited Alcatraz many times. He says he stays out of political debates but doesn't like the idea of scrapping the museum to make Alcatraz great again. “I think it's a bad idea,” Widner said. “You would be losing a lot of history there.” CNN's FJ Feng and Alex Matthews contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The website for USGS said the earthquake originated shortly after 9 a.m. EDT about 12 miles from Greenback, Tennessee, which is about 30 miles south of Knoxville. Meteorologists at television news stations serving Georgia and North Carolina reported feeling the tremors as well. Gabriela Reilly was making waffles with her husband when they felt their entire home shake in Braselton, Georgia, which is northeast of Atlanta. “Our ceiling fan started shaking for about 10 seconds,” she said. “I thought a giant aircraft had flown low right over the neighborhood, but my husband said, ‘No, that was definitely an earthquake! Jason Pack was still in bed at his home outside Knoxville when he felt the walls shaking and heard a rumbling that was loud enough to wake up his family and for the dog to start barking. “In east Tennessee, you're used to tornadoes and floods, that kind of thing,” Pack said. Pack has experienced tremors before, although this one is probably the strongest he's felt in Tennessee. “Even though this one was small, it's a good reminder — if it had been a big quake, would you know what to do? Drop, cover, and hold on if you're inside,” said Pack, a retired FBI agent who now works in crisis communications. Damage does not usually occur from earthquakes until they reach a magnitude of somewhere above 4 or 5, according to USGS, although it depends on variables such as building construction, soil, and distance from the epicenter. The largest of those was a magnitude 4.7 earthquake near Knoxville in November 1973. More recently, two tremors struck the seismic zone in December 2018. Its epicenter was about two miles southeast of Mascot, near Knoxville. It also was felt in parts of Georgia, Kentucky, and North Carolina. “Earthquakes in the East are felt over a much larger distance and by more people,” she said.</p>
