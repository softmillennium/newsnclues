            They are considered one of the world's most dangerous, and indiscriminate, weapons. Yet five European countries have turned their backs on an international treaty on the use of landmines, citing the growing threat from Moscow.
    


            Finland, Poland, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania – which all border Russia – have made moves to pull out of the Ottawa Treaty, the agreement that bans the use of anti-personnel landmines, which are designed to kill or maim if stepped on.
    


            The developments have alarmed campaigners, who see the reintroduction of the weapons – which have killed or disfigured tens of thousands of civilians around the world and can contaminate an area for decades after a conflict ends – as a concerning regression.
    


            The treaty, which also bans the weapons' production and stockpiling, was signed in 1997, and was one of a series of agreements negotiated after the Cold War to encourage global disarmament. Since then, it has been credited with significantly reducing the harm from landmines.
    


            Responding to Finland's decision to leave the agreement, human rights NGO Amnesty International warned that the Nordic nation was endangering civilian lives, describing it as a “disturbing step backwards.”
    


            The decision “goes against decades of progress on eliminating the production, transfer and use of inherently indiscriminate weapons,” the NGO warned.
    


            At the start of this year, the pact had 165 member states. But major powers, including Russia, China, India, Pakistan and the United States, never signed up to it.
    


            In a joint statement in March, Poland and the three Baltic states announced their withdrawal, arguing for a rethink on which weapons are – and which ones are not – acceptable in the face of Russia's aggression.
    


            The countries said they needed to provide their armed forces with greater “flexibility and freedom of choice,” to help them bolster the defense of NATO's eastern flank.
    


            The following month, in April, Latvia became the first country to formally withdraw from the treaty after its parliament strongly backed the proposal, meaning that after a grace period of six months, Riga would be able to start amassing landmines again.
    


            Also that month, Finland unveiled plans to join Latvia. Explaining the decision, Finland's Prime Minister Petteri Orpo told journalists that Russia poses a long-term danger to the whole of Europe. “Withdrawing from the Ottawa Convention will give us the possibility to prepare for the changes in the security environment in a more versatile way,” he said.
    


            The announcements come as U.S. President Donald Trump has doubled down on efforts to wrap up the war in Ukraine, which has stoked fears in neighboring states that Moscow could re-arm and target them instead.
    


            Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow of the Russia and Eurasia program at the thinktank Chatham House and author of the book “Who will Defend Europe?,” believes that if and when Russia's grinding conflict in Ukraine does come to an end by whatever means, Moscow will be readying itself for its next target.
    


            “Nobody is in any doubt that Russia is looking for further means of achieving its objective in Europe,” Giles told CNN.
    


            For Giles, the military benefits of using landmines are clear. The underground explosives, he said, can slow an invasion, either by redirecting oncoming troops to areas that are easier to defend, or by holding them up as they attempt to breach the mined areas.
    


            They can be particularly beneficial for countries looking to defend themselves against an army with greater manpower. “They are a highly effective tool for augmenting the defensive forces of a country that's going to be outnumbered,” he said.
    


            He believes the five countries leaving the treaty have looked at the effectiveness of the weapons, including their use in Russia's war on Ukraine, in deterring invading forces.
    


            However, he stressed that the Western countries wouldn't use landmines in the same way as Moscow's forces, saying there were “very different design philosophies” in the manufacturing of mines and cluster munitions between countries that aren't concerned with civilian casualties or may willingly try to cause them, and those that are trying to avoid them.
    


            In Ukraine, extensive Russian minefields laid along Ukraine's southern front lines significantly slowed a summer counteroffensive launched by Ukraine in 2023.
    


            Ukraine is deemed by the United Nations to be the most heavily mined country in the world. In its most recent projections, Ukraine's government estimates that Moscow's forces have littered 174,000 square kilometers (65,637 square miles) of Ukraine's territory with landmines and explosive remnants.
    


            This means Ukrainian civilians, particularly those who have returned to areas previously on the front lines of the fighting, are faced with an ever-present risk of death.
    


            “The large-scale contamination of land by explosive ordnance has created an ‘invisible threat' in people's minds,” Humanity & Inclusion, an international charity helping those affected by poverty, conflict, and disaster, warned in a February report on the use of landmines in Ukraine. “As a result, people's movements are extremely reduced or restricted, they can no longer cultivate their land and their social, economic, or professional activities are hindered.”
    


            According to findings from Human Rights Watch published in 2023, Ukraine has also used antipersonnel landmines during the conflict and has received them from the US, despite Kyiv being a signatory of the 1997 ban.
    


            In comparison, Finland, Poland and the Baltic nations say they would remain committed to their humanitarian principles when using the explosives, despite withdrawing from the ban.
    


            When announcing its plans to leave the Ottawa Treaty, Helsinki stressed it would use the weapons in a humane manner, with the country's president Alexander Stubb writing on X, “Finland is committed to its international obligations on the responsible use of mines.”
    


            While the responsible use of landmines is a complex issue, measures to reduce civilian harm can include making precise records of minefields and their locations, educating communities to their dangers and the clearance or neutralization of the weapons once the conflict is over.
    


            Despite such pledges of responsibility, the move away from the Ottawa Treaty has left campaigners horrified.
    


            Landmines have killed or maimed tens of thousands of civilians across the world and continue to cause harm. In its 2024 report, the Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor found that at least 5,757 people were killed and wounded by mines and explosive remnants of war across the globe in 2023, with civilians making up 84% of that number.
    


            Alma Taslidžan, from Bosnia, was displaced from her homeland during the war of the early 90s,  only to return with her family to a country laced with landmines – a contamination issue she says plagues the country to this day.
    


            Now working for disability charity Humanity & Inclusion, she described the five countries' decision to pull out of the treaty as “absolute nonsense” and “the most horrible thing that could happen in the life of a treaty.”
    


            She told CNN that the arguments for banning landmines have not changed since the Ottawa Treaty was formed in the 1990s. “Once it's in the ground, it's a danger. It cannot distinguish between the foot of a civilian and the foot of a child and the foot of a soldier.”
    


            She continued, “We are surprised that such advanced militaries like the Finnish, like the Estonians, Lithuanians, Latvians, would consider putting this hugely indiscriminate weapon in their military strategy, and what is worse, putting it in their land.”
    


            Yet, for some, the new, precarious security reality that Europe is facing means that previous red lines are now up for discussion.
    


            This is the case for Giles, who sees the latest developments as a recognition from these countries that treaties on landmines were “an act of idealism which has proven to be over-optimistic by developments in the world since then.”

Follow:


            US President Donald Trump said Ukraine should “immediately” agree to Vladimir Putin's offer to hold “direct” peace talks in Turkey this week, undermining European efforts to force the Russian president to agree to an unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine by Monday.
    


            After Trump last week said the US will impose more sanctions on Russia if it does not agree to a truce, the leaders of France, Britain, Germany, Poland and Ukraine met in Kyiv on Saturday to send an ultimatum to Putin: agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine by Monday or face “massive” new sanctions. Trump supported the initiative, the European leaders said.
    


            But in a late-night address, Putin did not acknowledge the ultimatum. Instead, he proposed holding “direct talks” with Ukraine in Turkey on Thursday – something not seen since the early weeks of Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022.
    


            “The decision now lies with the Ukrainian authorities,” Putin said.
    


            Although Ukraine and its allies stressed that there could be no further talks before a ceasefire, Trump on Sunday called on Ukraine to take part in the peace talks without a ceasefire.
    


            “Ukraine should agree to this, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “HAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!”
    


            After weeks of what appeared to be thawing relations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and impatience with Moscow's prevarications on ending the war, Trump's intervention will relieve the pressure on Putin and force Kyiv into an uncomfortable position.
    


            Before Trump's comment, Zelensky had responded with trepidation to Putin's offer, calling it a “positive sign,” but stressing that Kyiv first expects Moscow to agree to the new ceasefire proposal.
    


            Within hours, Ukraine's allies issued much more forceful rebuttals to Putin's offer, saying there can be no new talks before a ceasefire.
    


            Friedrich Merz, Germany's new chancellor, said talks “cannot begin until weapons fall silent.” Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the world is still waiting on Russia's “univocal decision on an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.” French President Emmanuel Macron said Putin's counter-offer is “not enough.”
    


            Keith Kellogg, the Trump administration's special envoy to Ukraine, whose influence has dwindled since January, echoed the Europeans' claims, saying a ceasefire must come before talks, “not the other way round.”
    


            But Trump abandoned his earlier demand that Russia agree to a 30-day ceasefire, instead calling on Ukraine to attend the peace talks without preconditions.
    


            “I'm starting to doubt that Ukraine will make a deal with Putin,” Trump said.
    


            For months, Ukraine and its allies tried to convince the Trump administration that Putin acts in bad faith, and have said Russia's agreeing to a ceasefire could function as a test of whether it is serious about achieving the peace the US president has long demanded.
    


            But Putin's offer for direct talks – made in a rare televised address at 1 a.m. local time Sunday – was a gamble to put the ball back in Ukraine's court and distract from the fact that Russia is likely to snub Monday's ceasefire deadline, analysts said. Trump's comment suggests that gamble has worked.
    


            Zelensky will be under “huge pressure” to agree to hold talks in Turkey, Sergey Radchenko, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, told CNN.
    


            “Why? Because otherwise, he'll have to deal with Trump, who's going to say, ‘Why are you undermining my peace initiative here? Why can't you just talk?'”
    


            Already setting the stage for talks, Putin spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday. The Kremlin said Erdogan “fully supported” Putin's proposal for peace talks and had offered Istanbul as a venue.
    


            Although Ankara confirmed Turkey is ready to host the negotiations, a statement from the country's presidency suggested that it agreed with Ukraine's allies that a ceasefire must come before talks.

            “Noting that a window of opportunity to achieve peace has opened, President Erdoğan said that a comprehensive ceasefire would create the necessary environment for peace talks,” the statement read. It did not say whether Turkey would decline to host the talks if Russia refused the ceasefire offer.
    


            The White House said Secretary of State Marco Rubio will visit Turkey from Wednesday to Friday, to attend an informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers and discuss “ending the Russia-Ukraine war,” meaning he will be in the country on the day of Putin's proposed peace talks.
    


            In a little over a day, the unity that was on display between Trump and the five European leaders in Kyiv seems to have dissipated.
    


            Last week, Trump had called for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine, without providing a deadline. “If the ceasefire is not respected, the US and its partners will impose further sanctions,” he warned. The European leaders in Kyiv added weight to the threat by naming Monday as a deadline. Merz said the leaders had called Trump, who “supports our initiative.”
    


            “Putin is very eager to make sure he retains American goodwill, because there's the parallel process of Russia-American normalization that's going on” alongside efforts to end the war in Ukraine, said Radchenko.
    


            “He knows that Trump wants direct talks,” Radchenko said. “Now, by saying, ‘Look, we're offering talks and the Ukrainians are the ones who are not agreeing,' he is putting the ball back in Kyiv's court.”
    


            In his address, Putin said Russia does not rule out that “during these talks there will be a possibility to arrange some kind of new truce, a new ceasefire,” but stressed that the talks will aim to eliminate the “root causes” of the conflict.
    


            Around the same time as Putin's late-night speech, a three-day pause in fighting ordered by Russia's leader came to an end, with Ukraine reporting more than 100 drone attacks overnight. Both sides accused each other of continuing attacks during the truce, ordered by Putin to mark Russia's World War II Victory Day.
    


            Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told CNN that Russia is “very grateful” for Washington's mediation efforts, but added that “at the same time, it's quite useless to try to press on us.”

News of present from royal family ignited accusations of bribery and corruption, as well as criticism against president

Donald Trump is reportedly ready to accept a luxury plane described to be a “palace in the sky” being offered to the US president as a gift from Qatar's royal family, almost immediately igniting accusations of bribery and corruption as well as commensurate criticism.

On Sunday, citing multiple sources familiar with the matter, ABC reported that the Trump administration was girding itself to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8, a jumbo jet from the Qatari royals that was estimated to be about $400m. Trump would then use the 13-year-old plane as the new Air Force One until shortly before the conclusion of his second Oval Office stint, at which point it would be transferred to his presidential library foundation no later than 1 January 2029.

The luxury gift from Qatar is expected to be announced next week during Trump's three-day tour of the Middle East that includes Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, ABC reported.

Trump toured the opulent plane in February while it was parked at the West Palm Beach international airport, ABC added.

Assuming Trump accepts the plane as planned, the jumbo jet would first be transferred to the US air force so the military branch could configure the aircraft to meet the specifications required for presidential travel, ABC's sources told the network. The network added that any costs affiliated with its transfer would be paid for by the US air force, which receives a significant portion of the revenue generated by federal taxpayers.

According to ABC's sources, Trump's attorney general Pam Bondi and his top White House lawyer David Warrington have pre-emptively concluded that it is “legally permissible” for Trump to accept the luxury gift and then transfer it over to his presidential library.

Both reportedly arrived at that conclusion after lawyers for the White House counsel's office as well as the justice department said the gifted plane was not conditioned on any official act and therefore was not bribery.

Those lawyers drafted an analysis for defense secretary Pete Hegseth which reiterated that nothing about the plane violated federal laws prohibiting US government officials accepting gifts from foreign states or their royals. In fact, ABC's sources said, Bondi's reading of the situation was that the plane was being given to the US air force and then Trump's presidential library foundation rather than her boss himself.

Nevertheless, reports of the highly unusual – if not unprecedented – gift that Trump's subordinates had afforded their blessing for him to receive triggered a wave of criticisms towards the president.

On X, Democratic congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland said: “Trump must seek Congress' consent to take this $300m from Qatar. The Constitution is perfectly clear: no present of any kind whatever' from a foreign state without Congressional permission. A gift you use for four years and then deposit in your library is still a gift (and a grift).”

Democratic pollster Matt McDermott echoed similar sentiments, saying: “Literally speechless…

“A foreign regime gifting a jet to a former president. It's bribery in broad daylight.”

McDermott remarked that the Trump Organization run by the president's children only days earlier had announced a new $5.5bn golf course in Qatar.

“Today: Qatar ‘gifts' Trump a luxury jet. Surely just a coincidence,” McDermott said.

Meanwhile, Harvard University international security professor Juliette Kayyem said: “The surveillance and security aspects are also as disturbing as the grift.”

The CNN security analyst added that “Qatar will surely offer a plane that satisfies their needs as well.”

CNN medical analyst Jonathan Reiner took to X and said: “Air Force One is a (checks notes) Air Force plane. A military aircraft. It's not intended to be a palace because the US doesn't have a king.”

Similarly, New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman and prolific Trump scoopster wrote that the plane in question was “likely the most expensive gift from a foreign government in US history and will likely raise questions from legal experts”.

She added: “If Trump continued using it out of office, it would give him access to a much more modern plane than Trump Force One,” which is a private Boeing 757 built in 1991 that belongs to the organization run by his sons.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Truce agreement was reached after diplomacy and pressure from US but within hours there was cross-border shelling

A fragile ceasefire was holding between India and Pakistan on Sunday, after hours of overnight fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours, as US president Donald Trump said he would work to provide a solution regarding Kashmir.

The arch-rivals were involved in intense firing for four days, the worst in nearly three decades, with missiles and drones being fired at each other's military installations and dozens of people killed.

A ceasefire agreement was reached after diplomacy and pressure from the US, but within hours artillery fire was witnessed in Indian Kashmir, the centre of much of the fighting.

Blasts from air-defence systems boomed in cities near the border under blackout, similar to the previous two evenings, according to authorities, residents and Reuters witnesses.

Late on Saturday, India said Pakistan had violated the understanding to stop firing and that Indian armed forces had been instructed to “deal strongly” with any repetition.

In response, Pakistan said it was committed to the ceasefire and blamed India for the violations.

By dawn, the fighting and explosions reported overnight had died down on both sides of the border, according to Reuters witnesses.

Power was restored in most areas along India's border towns after a blackout the previous night.

Trump praised leaders of both countries for agreeing to halt the aggression.

“While not even discussed, I am going to increase trade, substantially, with both of these great nations,” he said in a post on his Truth Social platform. “Additionally, I will work with you both to see if ... a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir.”

In the border city of Amritsar, home to the Golden Temple revered by Sikhs, a siren sounded in the morning to resume normal activities brought a sense of relief and people were seen out on the roads.

The fighting started on Wednesday, two weeks after 26 men were killed in an attack targeting Hindus in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir.

“Ever since the day terrorists attacked people in Pahalgam we have been shutting our shops very early and there was an uncertainty,” said Satvir Singh Alhuwalia, 48, a shopkeeper in Amritsar. “I am happy that at least there will be no bloodshed on both sides.”

Officials in Pakistan said there was some firing in Bhimber in Pakistani-administered Kashmir overnight but nowhere else, and there were no casualties.

The two countries, born out of British colonial rule in 1947, have gone to war three times - twice over the region of Kashmir.

Hindu-majority India and Muslim Pakistan both rule part of Kashmir but claim it in full.

India blames Pakistan for an insurgency in its part of Kashmir that began in 1989 and has killed tens of thousands. It also blames Pakistani Islamist militant groups for attacks elsewhere in India.

Pakistan says it provides only moral, political and diplomatic support to Kashmiri separatists.

The combined death toll in the recent skirmishes has reached nearly 70, officials have said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Artist borrows from past masters to create centrepiece of latest show, his first major mural in England

There was a time when Nicolas Party would be pursued by police for decorating trains and buildings across Europe with his distinctive street art. Now, grand galleries and museums invite him to unleash his visions on their walls.

His latest extraordinary piece, a large mural in soft pastel inspired by the works of a 17th-century Dutch artist and an 18th-century British master has materialised at the Holburne Museum in Bath.

As the finishing touches were being put to the work, Party said he was thrilled that the Holburne, housed in a late-18th-century building and the custodian of paintings by the likes of Thomas Gainsborough and George Stubbs, was hosting his work. “It's great to be in a grand place like this.”

For his new piece, his first major mural in an English gallery, Party borrowed from a small oil painting in the Holburne's collection, A Brawl Between Peasants, by Benjamin Gerritsz. Cuyp, a Dutch painter known for his allegorical oil panels and landscapes, influenced by Rembrandt.

Over four days he recreated the rather violent image over a whole wall of a gallery, raising an awful lot of pastel dust.

He used pastels again for a second, smaller work, this time on linen – a depiction of two horses in the style of Stubbs's horse and lion paintings, with a calm, ghostly human face between them.

The second work was then hung at the centre of the mural, obscuring much of the action. Party's mural is called A Brawl Between Peasants, After Benjamin Gerritsz, 2025. The second, smaller piece is Portrait With Two Horses, 2025.

The artist said he was drawn to the Dutch painting because he liked the “grim, funny” subject matter. “It's not a portrait or a sweet landscape, it's more unusual.” The mural is a close copy and Party said the addition of the second element – the horses and face image – made it his work.

It didn't worry him that the most dramatic part of the mural was hidden behind the smaller image, he said. “I think my work becomes my work when I put the two together.”

A chamber had to be built in front of the wall for Party to work in. The wall has to be prepared with acrylic paint, water and sawdust to create a sandpapery texture that holds the pastel.

“So that makes a little mess and the pastel generates a lot of dust. That's why we have to be enclosed.” He then uses both hands, applying the pastel and rubbing it to create textures and colours. “It's quite tiring so I use both arms.”

The piece is the showstopper in an exhibition called Nicolas Party: Copper & Dust, which features two rooms of smaller works including striking landscapes, still lifes and portraits, created out of oil on copper.

Chris Stephens, the director of the Holburne, said the gallery was excited to show Party's work. “With his deep knowledge of the history of art, especially his interest in 17th-century Dutch painting and in 18th-century pastels, both of which feature in the Holburne's collection, Nicolas's art is in a perfect setting.”

Taiwanese Olympic badminton men's doubles gold medalist Wang Chi-lin (王齊麟) and his new partner, Chiu Hsiang-chieh (邱相榤), clinched the men's doubles title at the Yonex Taipei Open yesterday, becoming the second Taiwanese team to win a title in the tournament.

Ranked 19th in the world, the Taiwanese duo defeated Kang Min-hyuk and Ki Dong-ju of South Korea 21-18, 21-15 in a pulsating 43-minute final to clinch their first doubles title after teaming up last year.

Wang, the men's doubles gold medalist at the 2020 and 2024 Olympics, partnered with Chiu in August last year after the retirement of his teammate Lee Yang (李洋).

Wang and Chiu won all five of their matches at the tournament in straight games.

The last time Wang claimed a Taipei Open men's doubles title was in 2018 when he paired up with his older teammate Chen Hung-lin (陳宏麟).

“Now it is my turn to set up the plays and lead the younger player,” Wang said. “This role change makes me feel pretty good.”

Wang said that the best performance for him and his new partner this year had been reaching the round of 16.

“Winning the championship at home this time really boosted our confidence. Actually, we started to improve two weeks ago at the BWF [Badminton World Federation] Sudirman Cup. We just didn't expect to go all the way and win the title,” he said.

For his part, Chiu said that pairing with Wang was not stressful, but motivating.

“The pressure does not come from Wang's past achievements, but rather from the desire to continuously improve myself in order to keep up,” Chiu added.

Wang and Chiu's win came after Taiwanese women's doubles pair Hsieh Pei-shan (謝沛珊) and Hung En-tzu (洪恩慈) earlier in the day clinched the title with a 21-14, 21-15 win over Mizuki Otake and Miyu Takahashi of Japan, also in 43 minutes.

The victory made Hsieh and Hung, the top seeds at the tournament, the first Taiwanese women's team to win the event in 17 years.

Later yesterday, Taiwan's Chou Tien-chen (周天成) lost to Singapore's Loh Kean Yew (駱建佑) 14-21, 21-15, 20-22 in the men's singles final.

Chou, 35, has won the Taipei Open title four times, with the most recent victory in 2022.

The total prize money at the Super 300 tournament on the BWF World Tour is US$240,000.


DEFENDING DEMOCRACY: 
                                        Taiwan shares the same values as those that fought in WWII, and nations must unite to halt the expansion of a new authoritarian bloc, Lai said                                        The government yesterday held a commemoration ceremony for Victory in Europe (V-E) Day, joining the rest of the world for the first time to mark the anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe.
Taiwan honoring V-E Day signifies “our growing connections with the international community,” President William Lai (賴清德) said at a reception in Taipei on the 80th anniversary of V-E Day.
One of the major lessons of World War II is that “authoritarianism and aggression lead only to slaughter, tragedy and greater inequality,” Lai said.
Even more importantly, the war also taught people that “those who cherish peace cannot

One of the bills, the Taiwan Assurance Implementation Act, requires the US Department of State to periodically review its guidelines for engagement with Taiwan, and report to the US Congress on the guidelines and plans to lift self-imposed limitations on US-Taiwan engagement.
The other bill is the Taiwan International Solidarity Act, which clarifies that UN Resolution 2758 does not address the issue of the representation of Taiwan or its people in

The Scarborough Shoal — a triangular chain of reefs and rocks in the contested South China Sea — has been a flash point between the countries since China seized it from the Philippines in 2012.
Taiwan also claims the shoal.

""There is no point in prolonging the killings. And I will wait for Putin on Thursday in Turkey,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

This week, the world watched in anticipation for Russia's Victory Day parade after President Volodymyr Zelensky commented that he could not guarantee the safety of those attending. Meanwhile, the European Union moves one step forward to banning Russian gas from the European continent. It is also revealed this week that U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has fallen out of step with the White House.

""(Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin... doesn't want to have a ceasefire agreement with Ukraine, but rather wants to meet on Thursday, in Turkey, to negotiate a possible end to the bloodbath. Ukraine should agree to this, immediately,"" U.S. President Donald Trump said.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will travel to  to Antalya, Turkey, for a NATO foreign ministers' meeting from May 14–16, where he is expected to address the war in Ukraine and push for stronger Allied defense commitments.

Preliminary findings suggest that one of the men killed the other before taking his own life. 

Western leaders dismissed the Kremlin's proposal for talks in Istanbul on May 15 as insufficient.

The Kremlin said the leaders held a detailed discussion about the Russian initiative and Erdogan expressed full support, reiterating Turkey's readiness to provide a venue and assist in organizing the negotiations.

Erdogan told Macron that international cooperation is critical for initiating peace negotiations and the ""sensitive implementation"" of Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction processes, the Turkish Presidency reported.

The pope said he was praying to God to grant the world the ""miracle of peace.""

Ushakov's comments follow Russian President Vladimir Putin's May 11 invitation for direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul starting May 15.

The assault began around 2 a.m. on May 11, with Russian forces deploying 108 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy UAVs from multiple directions, Ukraine's Air Force said.

Zelensky called a ceasefire the essential first step toward ending the war.

The number includes 1,310 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

""Think of the hundreds of thousands of lives that will be saved as this never ending 'bloodbath' hopefully comes to an end... I will continue to work with both sides to make sure that it happens."" 

""An unconditional ceasefire is not preceded by negotiations,"" French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters on May 11. 

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico arrived in Moscow on May 9 to celebrate Victory Day, commemorating the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. 

Slovak and Russian press agencies reported that Fico was accompanied by other politicians from his party, including Erik Kaliniak, Lubos Blaga, Richard Gluck. A deputy from the far-right Slovak National Party, Miroslav Radachovsky, was also a part of the group.

During his visit, Fico is expected to hold bilateral talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and a government representative of Vietnam.

Fico, who anticipated arriving in Moscow on May 8, was delayed in his arrival, following the Baltic states' decision to bar Slovakia's government plane from flying over their respective country's airspace en route to Moscow.

""Estonia informed us a couple of minutes ago that it will not allow us to fly over its territory,"" Fico wrote on Facebook. ""Of course, we are talking about a deliberate attempt to disrupt my visit to Moscow on the occasion of the official celebration of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.""

The Kremlin uses the annual victory celebrations for propaganda purposes and to showcase its military might, while Russian propaganda leans heavily on the Soviet victory in World War II.

Fico is known for inflammatory statements on Ukraine and the war that often echo Moscow's talking points. He has repeatedly criticized military aid for Ukraine and called for restoring relations with Russia after the war.

Fico's planned visit comes as another jab at the Western efforts to internationally isolate Putin over Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine. Slovakia is a member state of both NATO and the EU.

""An unconditional ceasefire is not preceded by negotiations,"" French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters on May 11. 

U.S. President Donald Trump's Special Envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, relied on translators from the Kremlin in his meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, NBC News reported on May 10, citing a U.S. official and two Western officials with knowledge of the talks.

Witkoff, who has emerged as Trump's de facto personal envoy to Russian President Vladimir Putin, has met with the Russian president several times in recent months. His most recent visit took place in Moscow on April 26, the day after a mass missile attack killed 12 people in Kyiv. 

Witkoff — a real estate tycoon who does not speak Russian — did not employ his own interpreter during these meetings, officials told NBC News. The decision represented a breach of typical protocols and rendered him dependent on Kremlin-provided translators. 

""If they speak to each other in Russian, he doesn't know what they are saying,"" one Western official said. 

Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, called Witkoff's refusal to use his own interpreter ""a very bad idea.""

""I speak Russian and have listened to Kremlin interpreters and U.S. interpreters at the same meeting, and the language is never the same,"" McFaul told NBC News via email.

Witkoff's conduct in high-profile negotiations has been previously called into question. The New York Post reported on April 30 that his approach caused concern among White House officials, with sources citing his use of Kremlin translators as one problematic choice.  

One source described Witkoff as a ""nice guy, but a bumbling f***ing idiot.""

In a statement provided to NBC NEws, White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said that Witkoff ""abides by all security protocols in coordination with the State Department.""

U.S. President Donald Trump has increasingly expressed frustration with his inability to secure a ceasefire in Russia's war against Ukraine. While his administration has sought warmer ties with Moscow, Trump backed Ukraine and Europe's proposal for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire beginning March 12 and said he would impose tougher sanctions against Russia if Putin refused. 

Putin did not agree to the proposal. In remarks on May 11, he instead invited Ukraine to begin direct negotiations in Istanbul on May 15. Russia has consistently refused to accept an unconditional ceasefire in its full-scale war against Ukraine.

Tufts University student from Turkey, Rumeysa Ozturk, left, who was arrested by immigration agents while walking along a street in a Boston suburb, talks to reporters upon arriving back in Boston, May 10, a day after she was released from a Louisiana immigration detention center on the orders of a federal judge.Matthew J. Lee/The Associated Press

A Tufts University student from Turkey returned to Boston on Saturday, one day after being released from a Louisiana immigration detention centre where she was held for over six weeks.

Upon arrival at Logan Airport, Rumeysa Ozturk told reporters she was excited to get back to her studies during what has been a “very difficult” period.

“In the last 45 days, I lost both my freedom and also my education during a crucial time for my doctoral studies,” she said. “But I am so grateful for all the support, kindness and care.”

A federal judge ordered Ozturk's release Friday pending a final decision on her claim that she was illegally detained following an op-ed she co-wrote last year criticizing her university's response to Israel and the war in Gaza.

Ozturk said she will continue her case in the courts, adding, “I have faith in the American system of justice.”

She was joined by her lawyers and two of Massachusetts' Democratic members of Congress, Sen. Edward Markey and Rep. Ayanna Pressley.

“Today is a tremendous day as we welcome you back, Rumeysa,” Markey said. “You have made millions and millions of people across our country so proud of the way you have fought.”

Appearing by video for her bail hearing the previous day, Ozturk, 30, detailed her growing asthma attacks in detention and her desire to finish her doctorate focusing on children and social media.

U.S. District Judge William Sessions in Vermont ruled that she was to be released on her own recognizance with no travel restrictions. She was not a danger to the community or a flight risk, he said, while noting that he might amend the release order to consider any conditions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, in consultation with her lawyers.

Sessions said the government offered no evidence for why Ozturk was arrested other than the op-ed.

The U.S. Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review did not respond to an e-mail message seeking comment Friday afternoon.

Ozturk was one of four students who wrote the opinion piece last year in campus newspaper The Tufts Daily. It criticized the university's response to student activists demanding that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.

On March 25 immigration officials surrounded Ozturk in Massachusetts and took her into custody. She was then driven to New Hampshire and Vermont and flown to a detention centre in Basile, Louisiana.

Her student visa had been revoked several days earlier, but she was not informed of that, her lawyers said.

Ozturk's lawyers first filed a petition on her behalf in Massachusetts, but they did not know where she was and were unable to speak to her until more than 24 hours after she was detained. A Massachusetts judge later transferred the case to Vermont.

A State Department memo said Ozturk's visa was revoked following an assessment that her actions “‘may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization' including co-authoring an op-ed that found common cause with an organization that was later temporarily banned from campus.”

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in March, without providing evidence, that investigations found that Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, which the U.S. has designated as a terrorist group.

This week a federal appeals court upheld Sessions' order to bring Ozturk back to New England for hearings to determine whether her constitutional rights, including free speech and due process, were violated, as her lawyers argue.

Immigration proceedings for Ozturk, initiated in Louisiana, are being conducted separately in that state and Ozturk can participate remotely, the court said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Kashmir crisis sparks press crackdown in India","https://www.dw.com/en/kashmir-crisis-sparks-press-crackdown-in-india/a-72498921","Sun, 11 May 2025 00:43:28 GMT","

Amid heightened tensions over the Kashmir region, India has ordered the blocking of thousands of accounts on social media and restrictions on news portals, sparking concerns over free speech.

With military tensions high and amid ongoing cross-border shelling and drone activities between India and Pakistan, the Indian government has ordered the blocking of 8,000 accounts on X and the removal of Pakistan-linked content across digital platforms.

Press freedom activists have condemned the move.

The Pakistani army responded with drone and artillery attacks after the Indian army claimed to have attacked nine locations in Pakistan and Pakistan-controlled Kashmir on Wednesday, killing what they said were numerous militants.

The Indian government also ordered the social media platform X to block over 8,000 accounts, including those of prominent Pakistani journalists like Hamid Mir and Najam Sethi, news organizations and even some Indian news portals like Maktoob Media, The Kashmiriyat and The Wire.

On Thursday, the country's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting also issued an advisory directing online streaming platforms to immediately remove all Pakistani-origin content, including web series, films, songs and podcasts, citing national security.

The Elon Musk-owned X has said it received executive orders from the Indian government requiring the company to block more than 8,000 accounts in India.

""To comply with the orders, we will withhold the specified accounts in India alone. We have begun that process. However, we disagree with the Indian government's demands,"" the company said in a post on its Global Government Affairs handle.

""In most cases, the Indian government has not specified which posts from an account have violated India's local laws,"" the company statement continued. ""For a significant number of accounts, we did not receive any evidence or justification to block the accounts.""

X also pointed out that falling foul of the executive orders could subject the company to potential penalties, including significant fines and imprisonment of its local employees.

Free speech advocates see the move by the Indian government as censorship, especially at a time when both sides have been engaged in competing narratives that have historically obscured the truth in India-Pakistan conflicts.

""At this crucial period, India should refrain from illegally and arbitrarily blocking social media accounts and websites of journalists, news publications and citizens, nor take any other steps that can restrict the flow of information,"" Prateek Waghre, an independent technology policy researcher, told DW.

""Such restrictions create a fertile ground for confusion and false narratives to take root, as they also limit access to reliable information and reportage,"" added Waghre.

Pratik Sinha, founder of fact-checking website Alt News, dedicated to combating misinformation and disinformation, criticized the government for clamping down on the media and independent voices in the name of national security.

""Authorities have never liked any form of independent media as it construes it as speaking against the government or country. This is censorship,"" Sinha told DW.

The annual South Asia Press Freedom Report, entitled ""Frontline Democracy: Media Amid Political Churn,"" released early this month, presents a stark assessment of press freedom in India, highlighting persistent and deepening challenges for journalists and media organizations.

Despite India's slight rise in the World Press Freedom Index, moving up to 151 out of 180 countries in 2025, the report underscores that core issues threatening press freedom remain unresolved.

""Every authoritarian effort is being made to crush those who seek to hold power to account — crackdowns on media houses, surveillance, intimidation and harassment of journalists, filing of police cases; arbitrary detentions; and the unleashing of raids by the Income Tax Department, and the Enforcement Directorate that oversees financial crimes,"" the report stated.

Another report, by the Free Speech Collective, highlights how the first four months of 2025 have not boded well for freedom of speech and expression in India.

""Censorship was rife, through direct and indirect attacks on free speech and press freedom,"" the report said.

""Any content-specific takedowns must proceed under clear legal grounds, publish the legal rationale so they can withstand constitutional scrutiny and establish an independent oversight mechanism for future national-security content actions,"" Apar Gupta, of the Internet Freedom Foundation, told DW.

The website of The Wire, a news organization known for its investigative journalism and its outspokenness, became inaccessible across much of the country on Friday.

The platform said the move was based on orders from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, under the IT Act of 2000 and said it would take legal steps to challenge it.

The Wire's ombudsperson Pamela Philipose told DW that at a time when hostilities at the borders are raging and citizens across the country are anxious to get authentic, misinformation-free news, this move to block it is extremely disturbing.

""The news portal always took to provide the public with a truthful account of all developments in a manner that was both readable and credible,"" said Philipose. ""We can only hope that this is only a passing blip and it will soon be back to doing what it does best — bringing authentic news and information to the Indian and international public.""

A government spokesperson refused to comment on the actions, but the motivations appear to blend genuine security concerns with a desire to control narratives.

But free-speech activists and media commentators believe the space for hard-hitting journalism, dissent and debate has rapidly shrunk in India's mainstream media.

Amrita Johri, a right-to-information activist who has worked on the issue closely, said the Digital Personal Data Protection Act of 2023, due to be put into effect soon, will undermine press freedom, investigative journalism and the public's right to information.

Activists have said the new measure also amends the Right to Information Act and provides a blanket exemption on the disclosure of personal information which will severely weaken people's ability to seek crucial information and demand accountability from the government.

""It will have a chilling impact on all those who collect, process and disseminate personal information including journalists, media, civil society and even political parties,"" Johri told DW.

""While curbs on fake news and misinformation are needed, regulations must be within the constitutional framework and subject to oversight by an independent mechanism,"" she added.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has also called for a ceasefire beginning Monday. US President Trump has urged Kyiv and Moscow to meet in Turkey on Thursday. Follow DW for more. 

Welcome to DW's live coverage of developments on Russia's war on Ukraine on Sunday, May 11:

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday he would be ""waiting"" for Russian President Vladimir Putin in Istanbul on Thursday.

""We await a full and lasting ceasefire, starting from tomorrow, to provide the necessary basis for diplomacy,"" Zelenskyy said on X. 

""There is no point in prolonging the killings. And I will be waiting for Putin in Tükiye on Thursday. Personally. I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses.""

US President Donald Trump has urged Ukraine to meet with Russian officials in Turkey on Thursday for talks on ending the war, saying he was beginning to doubt Kyiv will reach a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""President Putin of Russia doesn't want to have a Ceasefire Agreement with Ukraine, but rather wants to meet on Thursday, in Turkey, to negotiate a possible end to the BLOODBATH,"" the US president posted on his Truth Social platform. 

""Ukraine should agree to this, IMMEDIATELY. At least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible, and if it is not, European leaders, and the US, will know where everything stands, and can proceed accordingly!

""I'm starting to doubt that Ukraine will make a deal with Putin, who's too busy celebrating the Victory of World War ll, which could not have been won [not even close!] without the United States of America.""

Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed Russia's offer for direct peace talks, but insisted there must be a ceasefire in place before negotiations can start.

Putin has proposed direct negotiations with Ukraine in Istanbul.  But he rejected a 30-day ceasefire put forward by Germany, Poland, France and the UK. 

Turkey says it is ready to host talks between Moscow and Kyiv.

Pope Leo XIV called for the end of the world's wars during his first Sunday blessing and address.

He urged peace in Ukraine, called for a ceasefire and the release of hostages in Gaza, and welcomed the truce between India and Pakistan.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that Russia's willingness to talk is ""positive sign"" but ""far from sufficient"" in comments made after returning from his first trip to Kyiv.

Merz said that European allies were backing a 30-day truce, which ""Ukraine agreed to without reservation.""

""We expect Moscow to agree to a ceasefire that allows real talks to take place. First the weapons must be silenced, then the discussions can begin,"" the new conservative leader said in a statement posted on social media platform X. 

Merz was responding to Russian President Vladimir Putin's offer to hold direct talks with Ukraine in Turkey from Thursday.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron that Ankara is ready to host the negotiations for a ceasefire and permanent peace between Russia and Ukraine, the Turkish leader's office said.

Erdogan also told Macron that a ""historic turning point"" has been reached in the efforts to end the war between Russia and Ukraine.

The two leaders held a phone call on Sunday, Erdogan's office said.

Russia's defense ministry said Ukraine had violated the three-day ceasefire, unilaterally declared by Moscow, 14,043 times, according to state news agency TASS.

Russia says Ukraine's military tried to breach Russia's southern border into the regions of Kursk and Belgorod five times. 

Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the three-day ceasefire last week to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany in the Second World War.

Ukraine did not agree to the ceasefire, calling it a ""parade of cynicism.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin's offer of direct talks, but said a ceasefire must come first.

""It is a positive sign that the Russians have finally begun to consider ending the war ... And the very first step in truly ending any war is a ceasefire,"" Zelenskyy posted on X. 

""We expect Russia to confirm a ceasefire — full, lasting, and reliable — starting tomorrow, May 12th,"" he added. 

Ukraine's air force said Russia had launched more than 100 drones into Ukraine at night, shortly after a Russian 72-hour ceasefire had ended at midnight.

Drone attacks were reported in the capital city Kyiv as well as over Odesa, Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk. 

The three-day ceasefire was ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin to coincide with commemorations of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. Both Kyiv and Moscow accused each other of violating the ceasefire several times. 

The attacks came as Russian President Vladimir Putin ignored a European-proposed 30-day ceasefire, backed by the US, instead offering direct talks with Kyiv later this month.  

French President Emmanuel Macron said President Vladimir Putin's proposal for direct talks between Russia and Ukraine is ""not enough.""

""An unconditional ceasefire is not preceded by negotiations, by definition,"" Macron told reporters in the Polish city of Przemysl. He said Putin was ""looking for a way out, but he still wants to buy time.""

Macron was on the way back from Ukraine after he and the leaders of Germany, Poland and the UK met President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv.

""We need to stand firm with the Americans and say that the ceasefire is unconditional and then we can discuss the rest,"" Macron said.

Putin had proposed direct communication with Kyiv in Istanbul on Sunday, but Macron said that was not acceptable for Ukrainians because ""they cannot accept parallel discussions while they continue to be bombed.""

He also expressed doubt over whether Zelenskyy would agree for Putin's proposed talks.

US President Donald Trump said he will ""continue to work with both sides"" to end the war in Ukraine.

""A potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine!"" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, without specifying what he was referring to.

""Think of the hundreds of thousands of lives that will be saved as this never ending ""bloodbath"" hopefully comes to an end... I will continue to work with both sides to make sure that it happens.""

""The USA wants to focus, instead, on Rebuilding and Trade. A BIG week upcoming!"" Trump exclaimed.

The comments come after Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed resuming direct talks with Ukraine as early as next week.

Ukraine's air defense units are trying to repel a Russian air attack on Kyiv, the city's mayor Vitali Klitschko said, after Ukraine's air force warned of a drone attack on the capital.

""Air defense forces are working in the capital. Stay in shelters!"" Klitschko posted on his Telegram account at 4.55 a.m. Kyiv time (1:55 a.m. UTC) on Sunday. 

Kyiv's City Military Administration posted an alert on Telegram shortly afterwards. 

""An air alert has been issued in Kyiv due to the threat of enemy UAVs. We urge city residents to immediately go to the nearest shelters and stay there until the alert ends,"" it said.

It said that air defenses units were engaging enemy targets on Kyiv's outskirts.

News agency Reuters cited local witnesses who ""heard blasts in Kyiv from what sounded like air defence units in operation.""

This live map show Ukraine's regions which have active air raids. 

Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested restarting direct talks with Ukraine. 

In comments to reporters early on Sunday, Putin said that the talks should aim to achieve a durable peace and eliminate the root causes of the war.

""We offer the Kyiv authorities to resume negotiations already on Thursday [May 15] in Istanbul,"" Putin said.

""Those who really want peace can't be against [the proposal],"" he said.

The Russian president added that he would speak with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 

It's not the first time that Putin has tied a ceasefire to the condition of removing the root causes of the war he launched.

Putin typically lists several long-standing complaints he has with Ukraine and the West as justification for invading Ukraine in early 2022.

His demands usually include a stop to NATO's expansion and Ukraine's permanent exclusion from the defense alliance, the removal of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy from office and returning Ukraine to Russia's sphere of influence. 

In his comments, Putin did not directly address a request by Ukraine and four of its main Western allies for a 30-day ceasefire without preconditions.

The leaders of France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland threatened on Saturday to increase sanctions on Russia if it doesn't accept an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine.

The three-day ceasefire declared by Russia expired on Saturday at midnight. 

Ukraine accused Russian forces of only pretending to observe the ceasefire, which was declared for celebrations of the 80th anniversary of Russia's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. 

""The attacks on the front line continue,"" President Volodymr Zelenskyy said on Saturday. 

""And Russian assaults are ongoing,"" he said. ""They haven't stopped using aerial bombs against our front line positions and border communities.""

Russian shelling in Ukraine's northern Sumy region over the past day killed three residents and wounded four more, officials there said. 

Another civilian died Saturday as a Russian drone struck the southern city of Kherson, according to the regional government. 

The US embassy in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, warned on Friday of a ""potentially significant"" Russian air attack that may occur over the coming days. It didn't give any further details. 

Ukraine has been defending itself against Russia since it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. 

Here is a summary of the lastest developments in the Ukraine war. 

Russia's President Vladimir Putin has proposed restarting direct talks with Ukraine. He said that the talks could take place in Turkey as early as next week and that he would talk to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 

Russia's self-declared ceasefire ended on Saturday at midnight. Putin had declared the three-day ceasefire as Russia marked the 80th anniversary of its victory against Nazi Germany. But Ukraine accuses Russia of violating the ceasefire.

Meanwhile, Ukraine and its allies have pushed for 30-day ceasefire starting from Monday. Leaders from four major European countries threatened to increase sanctions on Russia if Putin doesn't accept the proposal for an unconditional ceasefire.

Bangladesh's interim government has banned the Awami League, the political party of the former prime minister, Sheikh Hasina.

Bangladesh's interim government banned all activities of the former ruling Awami League on Saturday.

The party is headed by Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh's long-serving former prime minister who was ousted in a mass uprising in 2024.

The ban is to stay in place until a special tribunal completes a trial of the party and its leaders over the deaths of hundreds of people during anti-government protests last year.

""It has been decided to ban the activities, including in cyberspace, of the Awami League under the Anti-Terrorism Act until the trial of the Awami League and its leaders ends,"" the country's law advisor Asif Nazrul told reporters late on Saturday.

Nazrul said the ban would safeguard ""the plaintiffs and the witnesses of the tribunal,"" he said after a special cabinet meeting.

The interim administration also approved an amendment to the country's International Crimes Tribunal Act, allowing authorities to prosecute political parties and their affiliated bodies.

The decision came after thousands of protesters held sit-ins on the streets of the capital, Dhaka, over the past days.

They said they wouldn't leave the streets until the Awami League was banned.

The Awami League rejected the ban, calling it ""illegitimate.""

The UN's human rights office says that up to 1,400 people may have been killed by what it calls the Hasina administration's ""brutal response"" to anti-government protests in July and August last year.

The vast majority of those killed and injured were ""shot by Bangladesh's security forces,"" a February OHCHR report investigating the student-led protests  found.

Hasina, who led Bangladesh for more than 20 years during two terms as prime minister, has been in exile in India since August 2024.

She, along with many of her senior party colleagues, has been accused of murder in many cases.

Hasina has defied an arrest warrant issued by Bangladesh over charges of crimes against humanity.

A federal judge in California temporarily blocked the Department of Government Efficiency's bureaucratic overhaul.

A federal judge in California on Friday temporarily blocked what at coalition of labor unions, local governments, and nonprofits argued was “the unconstitutional dismantling of the federal government by the president of the United States on a scale unprecedented in this country's history and in clear excess of his authority.”

Since returning to office in January, U.S. President Donald Trump — aided by his so-callled Department of Government Efficiency and its de facto leader, billionaire Elon Musk — has worked to quickly overhaul the bureaucracy, even though “the president does not possess authority to reorganize, downsize, or otherwise transform the agencies of the federal government, unless and until Congress authorizes such action,” as the coalition's complaint notes.

District Judge Susan Illston agreed with the groups and governments, which include the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Alliance for Retired Americans, Main Street Alliance, Natural Resources Defense Council, the city and county of San Francisco, Chicago, Baltimore, and more.

“The president has the authority to seek changes to executive branch agencies, but he must do so in lawful ways and, in the case of large-scale reorganizations, with the cooperation of the legislative branch,” wrote Illston in a 42-page decision. “Many presidents have sought this cooperation before; many iterations of Congress have provided it. Nothing prevents the president from requesting this cooperation — as he did in his prior term of office.”

“Indeed, the court holds the president likely must request congressional cooperation to order the changes he seeks, and thus issues a temporary restraining order to pause large-scale reductions in force in the meantime,” said the judge, appointed to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California by former President Bill Clinton.

Illston added that “a temporary restraining order is, by definition, temporary. The court will not consider defendants' request for a stay of execution of the temporary restraining order, as doing so would render the exercise pointless. The court must promptly proceed to consideration of a preliminary injunction.”

Welcoming the development in a late Friday statement, the plaintiff coalition said that “the Trump administration's unlawful attempt to reorganize the federal government has thrown agencies into chaos, disrupting critical services provided across our nation.”

“Each of us represents communities deeply invested in the efficiency of the federal government — laying off federal employees and reorganizing government functions haphazardly does not achieve that,” the coalition added. “We are gratified by the court's decision today to pause these harmful actions while our case proceeds.”

The “largest and most significant challenge to Trump's authority to remake the government without congressional approval,” as the coalition called it, was filed April 28 by the organizations' legal team: Democracy Forward, Altshuler Berzon LLP, Protect Democracy, Public Rights Project, and State Democracy Defenders Fund.

Illston's decision came just hours after an emergency hearing, during which coalition attorney Danielle Leonard “said the Trump administration's vision was to fundamentally degrade the services that Congress funds agencies to carry out, raising a profound separation of powers conflict,” according to The New York Times.

As the newspaper detailed:

“There's a presumption of regularity that used to exist with respect to the government's actions that I think they need to re-earn,” she said.

Ms. Leonard said the Trump administration has never been able to point to any specific authority through which the president could seize that power from Congress. And she said that the government has consistently offered competing and contradictory explanations of why Mr. Trump can authorize the massive restructuring without Congress.

“It's an ouroboros: the snake eating its tail,” she said.

Signaling a desire to keep moving through the process swiftly, Illston gave the plaintiff coalition until next Wednesday to file a motion for a preliminary injunction, and the federal defendants — Trump along with various federal agencies and their leaders — until the following Monday to respond, with a limit of 25 pages for both.

Even if the coalition's lawsuit ultimately succeeds, Republicans have a narrow majority in both chambers of Congress, meaning Trump could potentially work with lawmakers to pursue a similar gutting of the federal government before the midterm elections.

At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.

Why would a mega bank with one of the worst reputations in a scandal-ridden industry take over a popular institution?

The United States Postal Service (USPS) is a front line in the struggle for democracy and justice against corporate power, as a memo released by Wells Fargo unveils. Published February 27, the memo outlines a plan for privatizing the USPS and enabling investors to reap the profits. The plan has been met with criticism and protest, since achieving profitability relies on selling off property, firing workers, limiting or eliminating services, and raising parcel rates by up to 140 percent. At the end of March, senators introduced a resolution calling on Congress to affirm the USPS as an independent agency and protect it against privatization.

Wells Fargo outlines challenges to implementing their plan, including that legislation needed for privatization is unlikely to pass through Congress, support for the USPS remains high especially among rural communities and investors in a privatized USPS would need to contend with “nine collective bargaining agreements with seven unions covering 550,000 employees.” But the mega bank has solutions for each of these challenges.

First, it suggests using a reconciliation bill that would only require a simple majority of votes to pass through the Senate, aggressively limiting or eliminating services to frustrate public support, and undercutting unionized labor by laying off workers and slashing benefits.

In laying out its privatization plan, the bank is returning to a previous, historical ambition: Wells Fargo was founded in 1852 by stagecoach mail delivery executives, Henry Wells and William Fargo. Wells and Fargo wanted to capitalize on the California gold rush and used stagecoaches to ship gold and deliver mail and other supplies between outposts and mining towns scattered across the state. Over the decades, Wells Fargo merged with other “pony express” mail services to monopolize delivery. The westward expansion of the railroads eventually ended the bank's reign over mail delivery, but Wells Fargo's interests in USPS remain centered on capitalization and monopolization.

Steps toward privatization may already be underway. Before resigning from his position, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy signed an agreement with Elon Musk's “Department of Government Efficiency” — the pseudo agency finding efficiencies in the federal government on the backs of public-sector workers — and announced the elimination of 10,000 jobs.

USPS took a big step toward privatization on May 9, when the USPS Board of Governors announced that FedEx official David Steiner would become the next Postmaster General. Steiner was favored by President Donald Trump to lead the agency, despite the clear conflict of interest appointing a senior executive from a USPS competitor.

It's a special kind of irony that a mega bank with one of the worst reputations in an industry where the bar is embarrassingly low wants to take over a broadly popular federal agency. The truth is, we need the USPS. We do not need Wells Fargo.

If there's a federal agency that exemplifies democracy's potential, it's the USPS. The USPS delivers to every address in the country, without exception. No matter who you are or where you live, the USPS delivers birthday cards and love letters, including to people who are incarcerated in jails and prisons. Election ballots are sent through the mail, where people make choices about who will represent their concerns in the halls of political power. Prescription medication and abortion pills are received in the mail, providing people with access to health care and reproductive justice. Tax refunds, social security and stimulus checks arrive in the mail, offering people some financial security in a volatile economy. Seeds and saplings are delivered through the mail, making the USPS a partner in environmental justice efforts. The USPS even transports insects and live animals, including honeybees and baby chicks that sustain local food and agriculture.

What's more, the USPS employs workers at competitive wages and with union representation. These wages and benefits are hallmarks of working conditions and benefits won through organized labor, where workers express their collective power and fight for dignity on the job. Postal workers earn a median wage that is higher than the national average and receive benefits like health care and paid leave. With Black employees making up 29 percent of its staff, the USPS has played an important role in building the Black middle class (perhaps a reason President Donald Trump and Musk have the agency in their crosshairs, given the administration's anti-Black and segregationist agenda). Moreover, since formal education is not required to become a postal service worker, the USPS is one of the few places where workers can earn decent pay regardless of education level.

As I've written before, we should be imagining the dismantling of Wells Fargo, not the privatizing of the USPS.

Wells Fargo is an enormously unpopular bank well-known for its scandalous business practices. On a 2023 ranking of the 100 largest publicly traded banks, factoring criteria like credit quality and profitability, Wells Fargo came in last place. Two years later, it didn't even make the list. The mega bank has been charged billions of dollars in fines and penalties from regulators for repeated wrongful and illegal practices, including foreclosing on people's homes, repossessing vehicles, and overcharging fees and interest. The bank is fodder for comedy routines and an easy target for activists and policy makers wanting to express their displeasure with the finance industry overall. 

A bank that has kicked people out of their own homes and deprived people of their livelihoods now wants to undermine the public service that delivers the mail, too. If Wells Fargo and private investors get their way, more expensive parcel rates would be only one of many concerns. One place to look for understanding just how much privatization can cost are the experiences of people who are incarcerated.

For people locked behind bars, mail and phone calls are lifelines to the outside world. But, they're expensive to get. Phone calls are especially costly, in part because these services have been monopolized by private telecommunications companies taking advantage of captive populations. In some jails and prisons, telecoms charge $1 per minute for phone calls. One 15-minute phone call can easily cost as much as $25 — an outlandish price for the human right of communicating with loved ones. In 2024, the Federal Communications Commission intervened and issued a rule cutting costs for phone calls in jails and prisons. Under the new rule, a 15-minute phone call now costs between 90 cents and $1.35.

If the USPS is privatized, we can expect private investors to raise prices on stamps and parcel rates in the same way telecoms have made their profits off people who are incarcerated. Instead of the promise to deliver to every address, your zip code will matter more than ever. Rural communities, communities of color and poor communities will likely pay the highest rates for mail delivery, since, like incarceration, residential segregation aids in identifying groups of people for exploitation.

Instead of privatizing the USPS, we should be expanding its public services. For example, the USPS can expand the financial services it already provides. The agency sells over $21 billion in money orders every year and, between 1911 and 1967, operated a popular banking system out of the nation's post offices. At its height, nearly 4 million people held $3.4 billion in interest-bearing accounts (over $50.5 billion in today's dollars). People made deposits and purchased savings bonds alongside sending and receiving mail. However, President Lyndon B. Johnson ended postal banking as sales from defense bonds waned after World War II, bank lobbyists applied pressure, and people went elsewhere for financial services.

It's certainly possible the USPS is better at offering these financial services than Wells Fargo, given the bank's massive “fake accounts” scandal, where employees, under pressure to meet aggressive sales quotas, opened bank accounts for people without their knowledge and then charged excessive fees. In fact, rather than privatization, the USPS could be expanded to operate a public banking system again — a timely idea since private banks are facing less regulatory oversight from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to rein in their costs and fees.

The USPS is an agency where struggles for democracy and justice converge. If you care about organized labor, you care about the USPS. If you care about climate change, you care about the USPS. If you care about racial, economic and reproductive justice, you care about the USPS. If you care that your grandma receives her social security check, you care about the USPS.

Wells Fargo does not care about any of these things. Don't let it privatize the USPS.

There are a few things you can do to take action and save the USPS. Sign a petition, call your senators, host a teach-in event in your community or record a video about what the USPS means to you. Tell Wells Fargo and the Trump administration to get their hands off the USPS.

At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.

As the US celebrates “Mother's Day,” thousands of mothers in Gaza are mourning.

This spring, with hands overflowing with tenderness, Lolo Mando Al-Qishawi — a Palestinian mother living on Yaffa Street in the Al-Tuffah neighborhood in the eastern part of Gaza City — lovingly adorned her daughter in her Eid dress, her eyes reflecting the girl's pure, uncontainable joy. But soon, those same hands, trembling with heartbreak, had to strip away the colors of celebration, wrapping her child instead in the cold, final cloth of farewell.

Eid Al-Fitr was meant to be a day of blessings, but instead it turned into a haunting sorrow as a mother's heart was shattered. How had happiness vanished so swiftly? What cruel twist of fate had stolen away her sweet, innocent girl, who had wished for nothing more than a simple, joyful Eid?

This is how the mothers of Gaza endure every shade of pain.

Mothers in Gaza start fearing for their children during the nine long months of pregnancy, pouring their souls into preserving the fragile life within their wombs.

As a child grows before a mother's eyes, her love and protection only deepen; she beams with pride at her baby's first steps and first words. But now, again and again, mothers in Gaza have been forced to gather the shattered pieces of their children's broken bodies from beneath the rubble.

Lolo, my mother's cousin, was one of those mothers whose journey through infertility was a tale of endless struggle and heartache. Her greatest dream was simple: to become a mother, to hold her child in her arms, and shower her with boundless love and care.

But this dream was not easy to realize. Lolo endured years of grueling attempts through in vitro fertilization treatments, each procedure a painful step toward hope. The road was never smooth; she underwent numerous fertility treatments, one after another, with every failure intensifying the anguish in her heart. Yet she never gave up. Her determination to become a mother burned brighter than any setback.

Her father, living abroad, supported her unwaveringly, sending large sums of money to fund her costly treatments, never once questioning the sacrifices she had to make.

After more than 750 injections that drained both her body and spirit, her long-awaited miracle finally came — she was pregnant.

Lolo gave birth to the daughter she had dreamed of for so long, naming her Koki, the living symbol of her patience and struggle. Koki, who grew up in her mother's arms, became the light of Lolo's life, filling her world with joy for four beautiful years. But happiness, it seemed, was never meant to last.

On the second day of Eid, Koki was filled with excitement to go with her father to her grandparents' house to wish them a happy Eid and say “Eid Mubarak” to everyone.

Most children in Gaza cherish every moment of Eid — dressing up, going out to visit family, clinging to moments of fleeting joy. Lolo lovingly prepared Koki, dressing her in the beautiful dress she adored, and sent her off with her father, full of joy and innocence.

But just minutes later, a devastating message reached Lolo: The house of her husband's family had been bombed.

In that heart-stopping moment, the news came — the entire family was killed, including her husband and their beloved daughter Koki. In an instant, everything shattered. The joy of Eid was replaced by a tragedy so deep that no words could ever capture its horror.

Lolo's mind refused to accept the reality. Moments earlier, she had been laughing with her daughter and husband, holding onto happiness — and suddenly, in a heartbeat, everything was gone. How could a life built on love vanish so cruelly? How could an entire family be wiped out without even a chance to say goodbye?

Lolo's story is a deep wound, but the story of her daughter, Koki, cuts even deeper.

How could the military kill a child so innocent, so full of life, with such merciless cruelty?

My family couldn't reach Lolo on the phone because her grief was too raw, too overwhelming. But we watched a video clip of her on the news, broken and inconsolable, clutching her daughter's small body and crying out: “After all these years of struggle, I finally held you… How could you leave me, my beloved?”

To this day, Lolo wakes each morning with the same heartbreaking question on her lips: What crime did my innocent child ever commit?

Imagine how many other mothers in Gaza are experiencing the same grief as Lolo. We were all born from the womb of a mother who endured and sacrificed for us. We know their feelings — how they fear for us as much as we fear for them, how we live in constant anxiety, always fearing the worst.

I vividly remember at the beginning of the war when a house next to ours was bombed, and my brother Mohammad was struck in the skull. His injury was severe, and the feeling that swept through all of us was as if someone was trying to tear our family apart, to rob us of our happiness. I remember my mother clearly — how she cried bitterly and stayed awake all night, not resting until Mohammad was discharged from the hospital, and we knew he was stable and safe.

How many mothers will continue to live with this fear? How many will carry this unbearable burden, day after day?

It's not only the fear of death that haunts the mothers of Gaza, but also the unbearable agony of watching their children starve, unable to feed them, powerless to save them. 

It's not only the fear of death that haunts the mothers of Gaza, but also the unbearable agony of watching their children starve, unable to feed them, powerless to save them. A thought so unimaginable — especially in the year 2025. Who could have ever predicted that children would die from famine in such a time as this?

I vividly remember when the war began, my mother said something that haunts me to this day: “I wish you were still in my womb, so I could protect you more.”

She said this out of a profound fear of losing us, as if she longed for a way to shield us from the horrors we now face.

At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.

The U.S. military service academies will soon have to certify that they make no consideration of race, ethnicity, or sex in their admissions processes and instead decide appointments by merit alone.

This policy is set to impact the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York; the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland; and the U.S. Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Advocacy groups like Students for Fair Admissions have continued to raise legal challenges to the continued use of race in service academy admissions. Thus far, these litigants have been unable to force the service academies to discontinue race-based admissions policies through legal action. Last February, the Supreme Court declined an injunction request challenging West Point's continued use of race-based factors in its admissions process.

Hegseth's order provides a new way to eliminate affirmative action policies outside of the court system.

In his memo, Hegseth wrote that a merit-based admissions process in these military service academies “ensures only the most qualified candidates are admitted, trained, and ultimately commissioned to lead the finest fighting force in history.”

“Selecting anyone but the best erodes lethality, our warfighting readiness, and undercuts the culture of excellence in our Armed Forces,” Hegseth added.

The defense secretary said the service academies may adopt a merit system that considers athletic talent, prior military service, and student performance at a service academy preparatory school.

In March, the Naval Academy announced it would no longer consider race as a factor in its admissions process.

The Military Academy and the Air Force Academy followed suit in April, announcing they would also stop considering race as a factor in admissions decisions. All three service academies made these announcements while requesting reprieve from ongoing challenges brought by Students for Fair Admissions.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

Canadian snowbirds could stay longer in the United States without a visa if a bill recently proposed in the U.S. House of Representatives becomes law.

The bipartisan bill put forward by Reps. Elise Stefanik of New York, Laurel Lee of Florida and Greg Stanton of Arizona proposes to extend the time Canadian citizens can remain in the U.S. without a visa from 180 days to 240.

The Canadian Snowbird Visa Act, introduced at the end of April, would provide the longer time-frame for those aged 50 and over who both maintain a home in Canada and either own or lease a U.S. residence.

The politicians who sponsored the bill said the aim is to help boost the U.S. economy and revive the flow of Canadian tourists coming to the country, which has plunged sharply amid the strain in Canada-U.S. relations that has emerged since the re-election of President Donald Trump.

“We're supporting job growth, strengthening our bond with our closest neighbors, and helping local communities thrive,” said Lee in a statement.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

            It may be no surprise that President Donald Trump, who did not serve in the active-duty military, would rather celebrate victory than veterans.
    


            In multiple social media posts this month, Trump said he would declare November 11 as Victory Day for World War I. He didn't mention that it's already a federal holiday: Veterans Day.
    


            In a similar vein, Trump wants a military parade that could cost tens of millions of dollars to celebrate the US Army's 250th birthday, which so happens to fall on his birthday, June 14. It's also Flag Day, when the Continental Congress adopted the American flag.
    


            “I view it for Flag Day, not necessarily my birthday,” Trump told NBC News in a recent interview. “Somebody put it together.”
    


            It could be the same kind of coincidence by which the expensive new fighter jet the Pentagon is developing will be the F-47 and Trump is the 47th president.

Trump says he wants to rename Veterans Day to ‘Victory Day for World War I'



            Nobody at the White House appears to have put together that the day Trump wants to celebrate Victory in World War II Day, May 8, when Germany surrendered in Europe, was not the end of World War II. Americans continued fighting and dying in the Pacific theater until August, when the US dropped nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan.
    


            Trump said it's important for the US to celebrate these days. It sounds quite similar to Victory Day in Russia, a cringe-worthy idea for anyone who does not want to put the US government alongside Russia's. But on the other hand, the president is not calling for full-on federal holidays. There are too many already, he said. (It would also take an act of Congress.)
    


            The rhetorical idea of superimposing a celebration of victory over veterans is noteworthy.
    


            It's quite the evolution for a holiday that used to commemorate armistice when it was first observed by Woodrow Wilson in 1919, a year after the truce that ended the war:
    


“To us in America, the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country's service and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the councils of the nations.”






            A few years later, in 1923, just before his death, a frail Wilson would chastise Americans in an Armistice Day radio address for turning toward isolationism and not joining the League of Nations, a sentiment still relevant today as Trump disrupts the post-World War II economic and diplomatic order.

            The president most associated with that post-World War II order, Dwight Eisenhower, is also the one who proclaimed that Armistice Day should become Veterans Day.
    


            “Let us solemnly remember the sacrifices of all those who fought so valiantly, on the seas, in the air, and on foreign shores, to preserve our heritage of freedom, and let us reconsecrate ourselves to the task of promoting an enduring peace so that their efforts shall not have been in vain,” Eisenhower wrote.
    


            He may be better remembered for a farewell speech warning of a military-industrial complex, which also echoes across history now that Trump, unlike Eisenhower, wants to parade military hardware through the nation's capital.
    


            “We have the greatest missiles in the world,” Trump told NBC News. “We have the greatest submarines in the world. We have the greatest army tanks in the world. We have the greatest weapons in the world. And we're going to celebrate it.”

            • Progress on trade talks: Top US officials involved in negotiations with China this weekend indicated a deal may have been reached between the countries, after President Donald Trump's steep tariffs sparked a trade war between the world's largest economies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent touted “substantial progress” from the talks in Switzerland but did not provide details.
    


            • Middle East trip: Trump will visit three wealthy Gulf Arab nations this week, seeking to deepen economic ties with leaders who have pledged trillions of dollars in US investments and cast themselves as key intermediaries for global conflicts.
    


            • Luxe new Air Force One: During the trip, the Trump administration is expected to accept a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family to be retrofitted and used as Air Force One, sources told CNN, in an unprecedented move that raises major ethical and legal questions. 



            President Donald Trump is urging Ukraine to accept an invitation from Russia to meet for direct peace talks in Turkey on Thursday, without the condition of first agreeing to a 30-day ceasefire.
    


                    “President Putin of Russia doesn't want to have a Cease Fire Agreement with Ukraine, but rather wants to meet on Thursday, in Turkey, to negotiate a possible end to the BLOODBATH,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Ukraine should agree to this, IMMEDIATELY. At least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible, and if it is not, European leaders, and the U.S., will know where everything stands, and can proceed accordingly!”
                





            Trump added that he's “starting to doubt” Ukraine will make a deal with Putin.
    


Key context: While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he stands “ready to meet” with Putin, he and Kyiv's allies want Moscow to first agree to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by the US.
    


            The leaders of France, Britain, Germany, Poland and Ukraine met in Kyiv on Saturday to send that ultimatum to Putin. Trump, meanwhile, has increasingly engaged in the Ukraine peace efforts on a separate track from his traditional European allies.
    


            In a late-night address Saturday, Putin did not acknowledge the ceasefire offer. Instead, he proposed holding the direct talks with Kyiv in Turkey — something not seen since the early weeks of Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022.
    


            European leaders were quick to publicly reject Putin's counter-offer, and Keith Kellogg — Trump's special envoy to Ukraine — had indicated he was aligned with the Europeans before Trump spoke out today on social media.
    


            The Trump administration is set to accept a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family, which will be retrofitted and used as Air Force One during his second term, two people familiar with the agreement told CNN.
    


            The announcement is expected to happen within a matter of days. Trump embarks this week on the first major foreign trip of his second term, which will includes a stop in Doha.
    


            Given the massive value of a Boeing 747-8, the move is unprecedented and raises substantive ethical and legal questions.
    


            A Qatari official said the plane is technically being gifted from the Qatari Ministry of Defense to the Pentagon, describing it more as a government-to-government transaction instead of a personal one. The Defense Department will then retrofit the plane to the president's use with security features and modifications.
    


            Trump and aides toured the plane earlier this year in Palm Beach, and it is expected to be in use within two years, one person told CNN. Since his tour, Trump has boasted to people around him about how luxurious the plane was.
    


            This comes after the president was deeply frustrated by delays in new aircraft to be used as Air Force One. He at one point tasked Elon Musk with helping accelerate the process.
    


            Top US officials involved in high-level trade negotiations with China emerged from two days of talks touting “substantial progress” and appearing to confirm that a deal between the two countries had been reached, which could have massive implications for the global economy.
    


            “I'm happy to report that we've made substantial progress between the United States and China in the very important trade talks,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a brief statement today in Geneva, where the talks were held, calling the talks “productive.”
    


            US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer indicated an agreement had been reached after President Donald Trump imposed sweeping 145% tariffs on most Chinese goods last month.
    


                    “The president declared a national emergency and imposed tariffs, and we're confident that the deal we struck with our Chinese partners will help us to resolve work toward resolving that national emergency,” Greer said.
                





            “It's important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as maybe thought,” he added.
    


            CNN has asked the Treasury Department for clarification on the deal, though Bessent said details will be shared tomorrow morning. Ahead of the talks, Trump administration officials had downplayed expectations that a deal would be reached this weekend.
    


            “These are very tough negotiators,” Greer said of his Chinese counterparts, saying the group “worked very diligently” and the last two days were “very constructive.”
    


            Bessent said he and Jamieson have briefed Trump, who he described as “fully informed.”
    


            They did not take questions from reporters.
    


            Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has denied cuts made by the Department of Government Efficiency have impacted air safety.
    


            Air traffic controllers were not included in the DOGE cuts earlier this year, but some staff who maintain infrastructure for the Federal Aviation Administration were.
    


            Duffy said on NBC's “Meet the Press” today that while there was a “broader conversation about which positions are going to be preserved,” he was never asked to cut air traffic controllers, who have long been in short supply.
    


            He also emphasized that the FAA cuts were made to probationary workers. “It was the new employees that we were gonna let go. Many of them have come back,” Duffy said.
    


Air safety in the US: The transportation secretary was asked to address safety concerns at Newark Airport, where air traffic controllers face critical staffing shortages and repeat equipment outages — including the loss of radar for about 90 seconds on Friday, and more equipment issues that ground flights to a halt this morning.
    


            Pressed on whether it's safe to fly in the US, Duffy told NBC the country still has the “safest air space for sure,” emphasizing that flying remains safer than other methods of transportation.
    


            The transportation secretary did, however, acknowledge that he's concerned about the state of the nation's air travel infrastructure. He touted his three-year reconstruction plan to vastly upgrade the country's networks and equipment, and added that he plans to offer 20% up front bonuses to air traffic controllers to help refill the ranks.
    


CNN's Pete Muntean contributed to this report.



            Today's high-stakes nuclear talks between US and Iranian officials in Oman have concluded, a senior Trump administration official said, casting the latest discussions as encouraging.
    


            Led by President Donald Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, the fourth round of talks lasted more than three hours and took place both directly and through Omani moderators, the official said.
    


            In a positive sign ahead of Trump's first major trip of his second term to the Middle East, the two sides plan to “move forward” on more technical topics soon, according to the official, though a date has not yet been set.
    


            “We are encouraged by today's outcome and look forward to our next meeting, which will happen in the near future,” the official said.
    


                    For its part, Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei described the talks as “difficult but useful to better understand each other's positions and to find reasonable & realistic ways to address the differences.” 
                





The big picture: It remains unclear what kind of deal the two sides could reach, whether and how much uranium the US will allow Iran to enrich, and how a potential deal could be different from the deal reached by the Obama administration.
    


            Trump told reporters Wednesday that a decision on whether Iran can have a nuclear enrichment program has not yet been made.
    


This post has been updated with comments from Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson.



            Secretary of State Marco Rubio will travel to the Middle East this week, joining President Donald Trump in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, according to the State Department.
    


            Rubio will then travel to Turkey to attend the NATO Informal Foreign Ministers Meeting on Wednesday through Friday.
    


About the trip: Trump's travel to the Middle East this week marks the first major foreign trip of his second term.
    


            The president's top priority is to reach “economic agreements” with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates that would enhance their investments in the US, according to Trump administration sources.
    


            Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, his former chief Middle East negotiator, have also been privately plotting the more ambitious goal of expanding the Abraham Accords, the treaties negotiated during Trump's first term between several Arab Nations and Israel, the sources said.
    


CNN's Alayna Treene and Kristen Holmes contributed to this report.



            President Donald Trump said there was “great progress made” in the trade talks that began yesterday between the United States and China, signaling a possible thaw in the trade war sparked by his massive tariffs.
    


            “A very good meeting today with China, in Switzerland. Many things discussed, much agreed to. A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner. We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
    


            It was the first public comment from Trump after the day of talks in Geneva, which will continue today, according to a source briefed on the meetings.
    


Setting expectations: Trump's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is leading the US delegation, urged the public earlier this week not to expect a major trade deal out of the meetings, instead characterizing them as an opportunity to establish a constructive tone and agree on some basic principles.
    


            Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua called the Switzerland talks “an important step toward resolving the issue.”
    


            “However, an ultimate solution requires sufficient strategic patience and determination, as well as the just support of the international community,” Xinhua said.
    


How we got here: The US has placed a minimum 145% tariff on most Chinese imports, and China has responded with a 125% tariff on most US imports. As a result, trade between the two sides is falling sharply, according to logistics experts.
    


            Even reducing that tariff rate by half might not be enough to change trade levels significantly. Economists have said 50% is the make-or-break threshold for the return of somewhat normal business between the two countries. And the combination of fewer goods arriving in the US and increased costs on imports that do arrive has already started pushing up prices for Americans.
    


            Hours after Bessent set off for Switzerland on Friday, Trump floated the possibility of slashing tariffs on Chinese goods to 80% while demanding China “open up its market to USA.”
    


            A fourth round of talks between the US and Iran on Tehran's nuclear program has begun in Oman today, according to Iranian state media, with the two sides aiming to overcome divisions that could dash the tentative negotiations.
    


            The talks, held indirectly and mediated by the Omani foreign minister, are aimed at addressing Tehran's nuclear program and lifting sanctions.
    


            That they are happening at all is something of a breakthrough — the talks are the highest-level in years — but signs of firm progress are slim.
    


Each side is drawing a line: Both countries have expressed a willingness to resolve their disputes through diplomacy, but a central issue remains Iran's demand to continue enriching uranium for its nuclear program, which it insists is peaceful.
    


            The US has called uranium enrichment a “red line.”
    


            President Donald Trump, who is headed to the Middle East next week, has threatened that the US would resort to military strikes against Iranian nuclear sites, with Israel's help, should Tehran fail to reach a deal with its interlocutors.
    


            Iranian officials told CNN yesterday that recent talks with the US were “not genuine” from the American side. The Iranian source also reiterated that allowing uranium enrichment on Iranian soil is Iran's “definite red line” in the negotiations.
    


            US special envoy Steve Witkoff, who has been heading the American side, warned that if this session of talks were not productive, “then they won't continue and we'll have to take a different route.”

            Mónica got pregnant last year around the same time President Donald Trump was elected to a second term. And that is when her race against the calendar began.
    


            The Venezuelan national, who is in the United States legally but with temporary status, is terrified that Trump's long-promised effort to curb birthright citizenship will be allowed to take effect before her baby boy is due in August – an outcome that could effectively leave him stateless.
    


            “There's been a lot of fear,” the South Carolinian told CNN. “Every day it's a new restriction, and we don't know what will happen.”
    


            Mónica asked to be identified in this story by her first name because she is concerned about possible repercussions for speaking publicly about her situation.
    


            When the Supreme Court gathers Thursday to hear oral argument in a high-profile emergency appeal involving Trump's birthright citizenship order, the justices will technically be considering a procedural question about whether lower courts overstepped their authority by blocking the president's efforts nationwide. But the court's answer to that question will have enormous on-the-ground consequences, even for people – like Mónica – who are in the United States legally.
    


            Allowing the administration to temporarily enforce the order Trump signed on his first day of his second term could set up a dynamic in which a baby born in New Jersey would be able to access a passport or obtain a Social Security number, but a child born into the same circumstances across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania could not.

Four questions in the Supreme Court arguments in birthright citizenship cases



            Or the court could rule in a way that allows Trump to enforce the order against all but a handful of individuals.
    


            For nearly 150 years, courts have understood the 14th Amendment's text to guarantee citizenship to anyone “born or naturalized in the United States,” regardless of the immigration status of their parents. In a landmark 1898 decision, US v. Wong Kim Ark, the Supreme Court affirmed the idea that people born in the United States – in that case, the son of Chinese immigrants – were entitled to US citizenship, with a few narrow exceptions.
    


            But a small group of legal conservatives have for years focused on a second phrase in the amendment's text, requiring people to be “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States before they become entitled to citizenship. People who owe their allegiance to another country, the argument goes, are not covered. Trump often chafed against birthright citizenship during his first term and campaigned heavily on the idea of ending it if he returned to power.
    


            Those arguments will not be before the Supreme Court this week, but the absence of a question on the merits raises a thorny practical question for the justices: How much should they take the broader constitutional issues into account if they decide to allow Trump to enforce a policy – even temporarily – that flies in the face of a long-standing recognition that a person born in the United States, regardless of their parents' immigration status, is entitled to citizenship?
    


            “As a practical matter, I think the merits will to some degree have to be in the back of their minds,” said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University and close observer of the Supreme Court. “It's hard for anyone – probably even including a Supreme Court justice – to totally put those arguments aside in a situation like this.”
    


            Mónica, who is in her 30s, and her husband fled Venezuela because her family worked for the opposition to the country's authoritarian government of Nicolás Maduro. She came to the United States in 2019 and benefits from a form of humanitarian relief known as temporary protected status.
    


            The Trump administration has moved to end TPS for Venezuelan nationals, and the Supreme Court is considering a separate emergency appeal on the process it used to do so.
    


            Trump's executive order, signed on January 20, blocks federal agencies from issuing documents recognizing citizenship for people born to noncitizen parents but also people in the country on a temporary basis. Multiple federal courts blocked its implementation nationwide, including one judge in Seattle nominated by President Ronald Reagan who described Trump's effort as “blatantly unconstitutional.”



            A challenge for Mónica is that there would be no realistic way for her to secure Venezuelan citizenship for her son if he was unable to obtain a US passport. Maduro cut diplomatic ties with the United States in 2019. Even if she could reach an embassy in another country, Mónica said she wouldn't apply for a citizenship from a government her family is attempting to escape.
    


            “We left fleeing persecution,” Mónica said through an interpreter. “It would be a risk to make him a Venezuelan citizen because we're actively seeking asylum from the Venezuelan government.”
    


            In an unusual quirk of the case, Mónica will likely ultimately be able to obtain US citizenship for her son because she belongs to the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, a membership organization for people seeking asylum. The Trump administration has said in court papers it wants to enforce the order on a temporary basis against everyone except for certain members of ASAP, which is also representing Mónica, and another group.
    


            By the time the underlying case over birthright citizenship is resolved, Mónica's child will likely be walking.
    


            Meny, a native of Honduras who came to the United States with her husband and son in 2021, is in the same position. Her second son is due in July.
    


            “I was already pregnant when I started to hear rumors that the president would likely be taking away birthright citizenship,” said Meny, a California resident who also asked to be identified by her first name only. “I remember thinking it was so scary that my son had not yet been born and that his rights would be violated.”
    


            Meny, who is seeking asylum in the United States, said she is concerned about the conversation she might need to have with her son someday about his status.
    


            “As a mom – as a parent – it would be very difficult for me to explain to him why he doesn't have those rights,” she said.
    


            The difference between what's technically at issue in the case and the practical implications of the ruling have allowed groups on both sides to frame the emergency appeal in their own terms. The administration has focused almost exclusively on the separation of powers and what it sees as the courts' encroachment into the executive branch. Immigration groups, meanwhile, have warned the Supreme Court of “chaos” and say a ruling for Trump could “fundamentally fracture the country.”
    


            Trump has asked the Supreme Court not to lift the lower court orders blocking enforcement entirely, but rather to limit those orders to the states and individuals who originally sued. That could mean blocking its enforcement in 22 blue states or, possibly, against a handful of individuals. As a backup argument, the administration has urged the Supreme Court to at least allow it to plan for implementing the order at some point in the future. Anyone outside of those states or group of individuals then could be subject to enforcement.
    


            The administration has described that as a “modest” request.
    


            “Years of experience have shown that the executive branch cannot properly perform its functions if any judge anywhere can enjoin every presidential action everywhere,” the Department of Justice told the Supreme Court in March.
    


            Such a decision, if it offered further guidance or limitations on when district court judges could universally block a policy or law could have ramifications far beyond birthright citizenship.
    


            GianCarlo Canaparo, a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, noted that presidents of both parties – and both liberal and conservative justices – have raised concerns in recent years about the number of orders from federal judges that enjoin enforcement of a policy against not only the people who sued but everyone else in the nation. Those orders, known as nationwide or universal injunctions, have become common during the second Trump administration.
    


            Canaparo said he was unpersuaded by arguments that a uniform approach to citizenship in all states might supply a good reason for a nationwide injunction in this case.
    


            “The argument that we need uniform laws is a policy judgment,” he said, “which is just historically not a permissible basis for courts to be granting remedies of different sizes and scope.”
    


            But while emergency orders don't decide the merits of a case, they often have significant practical implications in the short term. In 2021, the Supreme Court declined to block a Texas law that banned most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy – even though the law conflicted with the court's landmark 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade. The court's decision effectively allowed Texas to enforce that six-week ban. Months later, the court's conservative majority overturned Roe.
    


            The Supreme Court is expected to hear more than an hour of argument on Thursday and hand down a decision sometime before the end of June.
    


            Between doctor visits and trips to supply their nurseries, Mónica and Meny will be following the outcome anxiously.
    


            “Because we're immigrants doesn't mean that we're enemies of this country,” Meny said. “We come because we have a necessity.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","As Trump calls for reopening Alcatraz, its most famous escape is still a mystery","https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/11/us/alcatraz-trump-reopening-san-francisco","Sun, 11 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT","


            Despite its reputation as ironclad, it was possible to escape Alcatraz. All it took was brains, guts and 50 raincoats.
    


            On June 11, 1962, three prisoners – Frank Morris and brothers Clarence and John Anglin, all in their 30s – shimmied with a homemade raft through hidden holes in their cell walls, climbed through a ventilation duct onto the roof and bolted from the island fortress into the freezing, choppy waters of the San Francisco Bay.
    


            The notion that the island prison is truly escape-proof is a key part of President Donald Trump's proposal to reopen it more than 60 years after the Bureau of Prisons closed it for being too expensive to operate.
    


            “Nobody's ever escaped from Alcatraz,” Trump asserted Monday in the Oval Office.
    


            But while Morris and the Anglin brothers were never found, fans of outlaw drama – and some of the prisoners' own family members – are convinced they actually made it to shore and lived out their lives hidden from justice and the public eye.
    


            “That case,” said Art Roderick, a retired US marshal involved in the investigation for nearly 40 years, “just never goes away.”
    


            Morris and the Anglins ended up in America's most foreboding prison for the most obvious reason: They were constantly trying to escape every other place they had been held, rap sheets in their FBI files show. Still, the federal complex in California known as The Rock broke neither their spirits nor their record.
    


            “Well, they didn't like being locked up,” said David Widner, 58, who has cowritten a book about his uncles' breakout.
    


            They also didn't like being poor. The FBI documents show more than two dozen charges combined for the two brothers – who grew up in rural Georgia with a dozen other brothers and sisters – mostly for burglary and breaking and entering.
    


            “A lot of it was just so they would have nice things,” Widner said. “They wanted better things that they didn't know how to go about getting other than stealing.”
    


Trump wants to reopen one of America's most notorious prisons. Here's how Alcatraz earned its reputation



            Clarence and John's last theft was of a tiny bank in Columbia, Alabama, the records show. They were arrested five days later – along with their older brother Alfred – on the run in Ohio, netting them 15-year federal prison sentences.
    


            The Anglins were transferred to Alcatraz following an escape attempt at the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas, which at the time was the largest maximum-security prison in the United States. Prison officials said Clarence tried to get out – with John's help – by hiding inside two large metal breadboxes.
    


            Clarence only got as far as the prison bakery before being caught, FBI records show, but it was the kind of creative solution that didn't surprise the Anglin family. As children, the boys once figured out how to reuse a punctured tire by packing the hole full of moss, Widner told CNN.
    


            When the Anglins were paired in adjoining cells at Alcatraz next to Morris – another prisoner sent to the Rock due to repeated escapes – another attempt seemed almost inevitable.
    


            Based on the evidence they could gather, along with testimony from inmate Allen West – who was part of the conspiracy but said the three escapees left without him that night in 1962 – the Federal Bureau of Investigation pieced together an extraordinary plot accomplished slowly over six months:
    


            The most ingenious part of the men's plan may have been using cement fragments, cotton, hair fragments from the prison barber shop, glue and paint to create three dummy heads. The improvised sculptures were crude and grotesque but just realistic enough at a distance to fool the night guards into thinking the men were sound asleep in their beds.
    


            “My mom and the brothers and sisters always said they were the modern-day MacGyvers,” Widner remembered, recalling the TV show about a technical genius who uses found objects to construct whatever he needs to get out of tricky situations. “They could take nothing and make something out of it.”
    


            Investigators agreed, according to an FBI case memo filed three days after the escape. The “work which the subjects performed in preparation for the escape is fantastic,” Special Agent in Charge Frank L. Price said.
    


            Another factor working in the men's favor was the prison's deterioration. Plans were already underway to decommission the extraordinarily costly prison, according to Roderick, with Warden Olin Blackwell telling reporters it would take $5 million to get Alcatraz in proper condition, the equivalent today of $53 million.
    


            “They weren't doing any repairs at the time,” the retired marshal said, and the Bureau of Prisons was struggling to keep the facility properly staffed. “You put all that together, and that's how the escape occurred.”
    


            Investigators found the men punched out holes in their cell walls by drilling them over weeks and covering their work with painted cardboard, FBI records show. Climbing up the pipes of a utility shaft, the inmates disassembled the ventilation covers, descended the roof on a chimney pipe and scaled a fence.
    


            Launching the raft they had designed with the help of a Sports Illustrated magazine, the three escaped into the frigid darkness, government files say.
    


            Intriguing clues soon turned up. But, somehow, they all seemed to go nowhere.
    


            “I have never in my life come across a case that has more of those types of leads,” Roderick said.
    


            Within hours of the escape, investigators scoured the waters around Alcatraz. State police were put on alert. The Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers contributed boats and a helicopter, FBI records show. Blackwell, the warden, even ordered a full search of Alcatraz on the off chance the men never actually left.
    


            A hundred soldiers and 35 military police combed Angel Island, the spot just north of Alcatraz where West told investigators the men planned to go. “No evidence was found to indicate the Escapees ever reached this island,” an FBI report says.
    


            “Of course, it became the hottest thing in the media at the time,” retired FBI agent John Arend said years later. “We didn't have cable news, but you had all the media very fascinated with this case.”
    


            Then, the first bit of evidence the guys might have survived appeared. But it did not wash up on shore. It arrived by mail.
    


                    “HA HA WE MADE IT.”
                





            The postcard addressed to “Warden, Alcatraz Prison” turned up June 18, signed “Frank, Jim, Clarence,” each in a different hand.
    


            The FBI commissioned a handwriting expert, who determined the signature of “Clarence” was likely a forgery. There were not enough handwriting samples of John and Frank to make a comparison, and the FBI concluded the card was probably a hoax inspired by the intense and worldwide news coverage.
    


            Within days, searchers skimming the waters near Alcatraz Island, with its crystal-clear view of the Golden Gate Bridge, found sparse evidence related to the escape, including a portion of one of their improvised oars and part of a homemade life jacket, FBI records show.
    


            Sealed packets made out of the same material as the raft contained personal photos of the Anglins and family addresses, as well as contact information for a San Francisco attorney who had defended Alcatraz inmates in the past, the files say. The attorney told the FBI he never heard from Morris or the Anglins.
    


            The government files contain dozens of contacts from people who said they may have seen the prisoners, but none ever panned out. They also include then-Director J. Edgar Hoover's reluctance to reveal the information the bureau had to the public.
    


            “I trust our (San Francisco) Office isn't giving (a) ‘blow by blow' account to the press nor anyone else,” Hoover said in a June 13 memo. “Our job is to find these thugs, not keep them advised of our progress.”
    


            The Anglin family is convinced that, despite the FBI's release of hundreds of pages of documents in the case, the agency is still reluctant to discuss the full story.
    


            “They know things they won't tell because they couldn't find them,” Widmer said.
    


            Widner's first encounter with his uncles' story came in 1977, when four men from the FBI visited his home and asked his mother Marie if she had any information about where her brothers, Clarence and John Anglin, ended up, he said.
    


            “She told them no, and if she did (know), she wouldn't tell them,” he said.
    


            Two years later, the FBI closed its investigation, saying it had never found any evidence Morris and the Anglin brothers survived the escape attempt. “They are presumed to be dead,” a 1979 memo stated.
    


            But the Marshals Service, which is responsible for capturing fugitives, has never closed its file. Wanted posters of the three remain on the service's website, and the government even created computer-aged portraits showing how they believe the men would have appeared in their mid-80s.
    


            “There have been actionable leads that have come in,” said Roderick, the retired marshal who continues to consult on the case.
    


            The assumption that Morris and the Anglin brothers could not have possibly survived the tricky tides and freezing cold spray of the San Francisco Bay took a hit in 2003 from an unlikely source: reality TV. The Discovery Channel science program “MythBusters” launched its own raincoat raft from Alcatraz, matching the tools and circumstances of the 1962 escape as closely as possible. (Discovery and CNN share the same parent company.)
    


            Following the bay's currents west toward the Golden Gate Bridge instead of the long-assumed path north toward Angel Island, hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman successfully landed at the Marin Headlands in their homemade watercraft, saying the three men's survival was “entirely possible.”
    


            A decade later, Dutch scientists using computer models of currents in the Bay found the brothers and Morris could have made it safely to the Golden Gate Bridge area if they had left between 11 p.m. and midnight. Prison officials believed the men escaped between 10:30 and 11 p.m., they told the FBI.
    


            The changing tides would then have sent any debris related to their trek back toward Angel Island, the researchers found. “We don't know how good they were at paddling, but I suppose if you ever have energy to spare, it would be in that situation,” said study co-author Rolf Hut at the Delft University of Technology.
    


            More than 40 years after the FBI turned over the investigation to the Marshals Service, leads continue to surface. The Anglin family says it got a photo from a family friend purportedly showing the brothers in Brazil in 1975, something the Marshals Service has said is impossible to verify.
    


            In 2013, the FBI got a letter that claimed to be from John Anglin, CNN affiliate KPIX reported. The writer said he would be willing to turn himself in if he was publicly promised cancer treatment and a one-year prison sentence.
    


            Even relatives who believe the inmates survived their escape acknowledge the men – who would now all be in their 90s – are almost certainly no longer around to be found.
    


            “They either died in the Bay or are dead by now,” Roderick said.
    


            The dramatic 1962 disappearance – which inspired the 1979 Clint Eastwood movie, “Escape from Alcatraz” – seemed to harden the resolve of then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy that Alcatraz had outlived its usefulness, telling reporters he was committing to closing it.
    


            “Kennedy does not agree with the view that Alcatraz should be retained as a deterent (sic) to hardened criminals in that other institutions could fill the same role at less expense,” stated an FBI memo, citing a story in the San Francisco Chronicle.
    


            Alcatraz was shuttered for good the following year, remaining dormant until the National Park Service began converting it into a museum in 1972. Since then, the former lockup has attracted more than a million visitors a year, one of the most popular National Park sites, according to the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy.
    


            But Trump sees the site much differently.
    


            “It represents something strong, very powerful in terms of law and order. Our country needs law and order; Alcatraz is, I would say, the ultimate,” the president said Monday. “We'll see if we can bring it back in large form, add a lot.”
    


            Widner, the Anglins' nephew, has visited Alcatraz many times. He says he stays out of political debates but doesn't like the idea of scrapping the museum to make Alcatraz great again.
    


            “I think it's a bad idea,” Widner said. “You would be losing a lot of history there.”

            • Ceasefire holds: A ceasefire between India and Pakistan appears to be holding on Sunday despite accusations of violations by both sides. Explosions rocked several parts of Kashmir hours after the truce was announced on Saturday, but both countries have reiterated their commitment to the agreement.
    


            • Overnight diplomacy: US President Donald Trump said a night of talks mediated by Washington helped secure the deal, after the White House received alarming intelligence on the conflict, according to US sources. Trump says he's “proud” of the US role bringing the fighting to an end — although India has downplayed US involvement in the talks.
    


            • Kashmir massacre: Tensions ratcheted up between the neighboring states after a massacre of tourists last month in Indian-controlled Kashmir. India blamed Pakistan for the attack and launched “Operation Sindoor” Wednesday in both Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Islamabad has denied involvement in the killings.
    


            • Long-running conflict: Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan each control parts of Kashmir but claim it in full and have fought three wars over the territory.
    


Our live coverage of the conflict between India and Pakistan has wrapped up for the day.

            India's military says it downed “a few” Pakistani aircraft during its conflict with Islamabad, although it says it couldn't give exact numbers as the wreckage of the planes had fallen outside India's border.
    


            “Their planes were prevented from coming inside our border so we do not have the wreckage with us but definitely we have downed a few planes,” India's Director General of Military Operations (DMGO) Rajiv Ghai said in a briefing Sunday.
    


            He said that the country's military are still exploring the “technical details.”
    


            Ghai added that the Pakistan army is reported to have lost approximately 35 to 40 personnel in artillery and small arms firing on the Line of Control (LoC) – the de facto border separating Indian- and Pakistan-administered Kashmir – between the 7th and 10th of May.
    


            India lost five military personnel, he said.
    


            According to Ghai, “over 100 terrorists were killed by Indian operations.”
    


            CNN cannot verify the claims. Pakistan has previously claimed to have shot down five Indian jets.
    


            In Pakistan-administered Kashmir, locals who have endured restless nights along the Line of Control (LoC) – a flashpoint area in the recent hostilities between Islamabad and New Delhi – remain skeptical about the ceasefire which on Saturday brought an abrupt end to the conflict.
    


            Mian Mehboob ul Hassan, a resident of Leepa Valley on the Line of Control (LoC), told CNN that India had a “bad track record” of sticking to ceasefires in the past.
    


            However, he welcomed the cessation in hostilities and said it offered both sides a “privilege.”
    


            Farooq Haider Khan, the former prime minister of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, similarly said he believed the truce would only be temporary. He told CNN that India had not respected ceasefires in previous conflicts.
    


            Despite accusations of violations from both sides, the truce announced Saturday appears to be holding.
    


            After initial accusations of violations, a ceasefire between India and Pakistan appears to be holding on Sunday.
    


            Pakistan's foreign ministry late on Saturday local time said the country “remains committed” to upholding the truce, while an Indian defense source told CNN Sunday that the air force's operational readiness remains high.
    


Here are the latest developments: 



Pope Leo XIV welcomed the ceasefire between India and Pakistan in his first Sunday address, which also saw him appeal for peace in Ukraine and Gaza.
    


                    “I welcomed the announcement of the ceasefire between India and Pakistan and I hope that through negotiations we can reach a lasting agreement,” he said.
                





            Also during his “message of peace” to the huge crowds gathered St. Peter's Square, the new pope called for peace in Ukraine, as well as a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages. He called for humanitarian aid to be provided “to the exhausted population” in Gaza.
    


            India's military action against Pakistan has sent a bold message to terrorists, India's defense minister said Sunday.
    


            Addressing an event on Sunday, Defense Minister Rajnath Singh said that the terrorists who had killed 26 people in Indian-administered Kashmir last month and “erased the sindoor of many families had now been brought to justice.”
    


            The word ‘sindoor' is a reference to the red vermilion, or powder, that many Hindu women wear on their foreheads after marriage and is a symbolic nod to the killings in April, which left several women widowed.
    


            Singh said that India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, had sent a clear message that India will carry out “impactful action” against terrorism, “whether it is on this side of the border or across the border.”
    


            The 26 killed at a scenic mountain spot in Indian-administered Kashmir were mostly Indian tourists. India blamed the attack on Pakistan-based terrorists. Islamabad denied the accusation. The attack served as the trigger for India to launch its military action – dubbed “Operation Sindoor” – against Pakistan.
    


            After launching its first strikes against Islamabad on Wednesday, New Delhi said it was targeting “terrorist infrastructure” in the country. It later also acknowledged targeting Pakistani military infrastructure.
    


            The Indian Air Force said Sunday that its military operation against Pakistan had been “successfully executed” but was “still ongoing.”
    


            An Indian defense source told CNN Sunday that the air force's operational readiness is still high despite the ceasefire announced on Saturday.
    


                    “The Indian Air Force (IAF) has successfully executed its assigned tasks in Operation Sindoor, with precision and professionalism,” the statement said, referring to the name given to the operation.
                





            “Since the Operations are still ongoing, a detailed briefing will be conducted in due course.”
    


            Since the truce came into effect on Saturday at 5pm Indian time (730a ET) both sides have accused each other of ceasefire violations.
    


            India's foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, told a news conference on Saturday that there had been “repeated violations” of the agreement.
    


            There have been no fresh strikes or drone flights reported in Pakistan Sunday.
    


            Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said Sunday that it appreciated the constructive role played by the US and other friendly states “in supporting the recent ceasefire understanding between Pakistan and India, a step towards de-escalation and regional stability.”
    


            Residents of Indian-administered Kashmir say they are relieved and happy that India and Pakistan have reached a ceasefire agreement, and are assessing the damage caused by days of tit-for-tat strikes.
    


                    “When we heard of the ceasefire through the news, we were so happy!” said a 21-year-old student from the town of Uri, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) east of the de-facto border known as the Line of Control.
                





            “People are coming back to the village… there is hope finally that things will be better,” the student, who asked not to be named, told CNN.
    


            A 30-year-old resident, who lives near the town of Kupwara in India-administered Kashmir and also asked not to be named, said “people are out and about, smoking, discussing the politics between India and Pakistan.”
    


            “One day ago, people thought they would leave their homes and the next day we have this news. We are very happy and hopeful,” the resident said.
    


            Video showed markets reopening and people walking through the streets of several towns in India-administered Kashmir.
    


            Mohammed Tahir, a resident of Srinagar in India-administered Kashmir, told CNN the ceasefire “offers a window for stability” and that he hopes it holds.
    


            “Otherwise the current calm risks being a temporary respite,” he said.
    


            Deepika Pushkar Nath, a lawyer from Jammu, told CNN that on Saturday “everything was shut down and no-one was moving out, markets were closed.”
    


            Then people saw President Trump's post that there was a ceasefire and there was relief, Nath said. Some people felt that the war was ending too soon and India should have continued to fight, he said, but others were happy to return to their normal lives.
    


            Even so, Nath added: “There is also a lingering anger, people are asking why Pakistan is celebrating. Did we lose?”
    


            A key water-sharing pact between India and Pakistan remains suspended, a source within India's foreign ministry told CNN, despite the two countries reaching a ceasefire agreement on Saturday.
    


            India suspended its involvement in the Indus Water Treaty days after last month's deadly massacre of tourists in India-administered Kashmir. It has been in force since 1960 and is regarded as a rare diplomatic success story between the two fractious neighbors.
    


            “There is no pre- or post-condition of the ceasefire. The call was initiated from Pakistan. The Indus Water Treaty will remain in abeyance,” the source told CNN.
    


            The treaty governs the sharing of water from the enormous Indus River system, a vital resource supporting hundreds of millions of livelihoods across Pakistan and northern India. The Indus originates in Tibet and flows through China and India-controlled Kashmir before reaching Pakistan.
    


            Islamabad has called any attempt to stop or divert water belonging to Pakistan an “act of war.”
    


            On Sunday, Pakistan's defense minister told Geo News that the water treaty was among its top priorities in discussions with India, as well as disputed Kashmir and “terrorism.”
    


            CNN has reached out to Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for further comment.
    


This post has been updated with additional information. 



            US President Donald Trump said he is “proud” that Washington was able to help India and Pakistan reach an immediate ceasefire, and said he would increase trade “substantially” with both countries.
    


            “I am very proud of the strong and unwavering powerful leadership of India and Pakistan for having the strength, wisdom and fortitude to fully know and understand that it was time to stop the current aggression,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social late Saturday.
    


                    “I am proud that the USA was able to help you arrive at this historic and heroic decision,” he wrote.
                





            India has downplayed US involvement, with its Ministry of Information saying the agreement was worked out “directly between the two countries,” but Pakistani officials have heaped praise on Washington.
    


            “We thank President Trump for his leadership and proactive role for peace in the region,” said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday.
    


            In his post, Trump went on to say: “While not even discussed, I am going to increase trade, substantially, with both of these great Nations.”
    


            And he pledged to see if a solution could be reached on the Kashmir dispute, writing: “I will work with you both to see if, after a ‘thousand years,' a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir.”
    


            China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke with top officials from India and Pakistan on Saturday, shortly before a ceasefire was reached between Islamabad and New Delhi to bring an end to the dangerous spiral of tit-for-tat strikes, Beijing's foreign ministry said.
    


            Speaking separately with Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, Wang emphasized China's support for an immediate ceasefire and stressed the need to adhere to it to prevent further conflict, according to readouts from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
    


            China, a neighbor to both India and Pakistan, has urged the countries to avoid further escalating a conflict that would threaten regional stability, and to resolve their differences through dialogue.
    


            “The current international situation is complex and turbulent, and the peace and stability of Asia are hard-won and should be treasured,” Wang told Doval, China's readout said.
    


            In a separate call, Dar thanked China for its mediation efforts aimed at achieving a ceasefire and expressed a desire to maintain close communication with China, according to a readout from Pakistan's foreign ministry.
    


            Pakistan and India agreed to an immediate ceasefire later Saturday, unexpectedly halting the spiral of retaliatory military operations triggered by last month's massacre of tourists in Pahalgam in India-administered Kashmir.
    


            Pakistan is observing an Islamic day of thanksgiving on Sunday, after the government agreed to an immediate ceasefire with India in the wake of tit-for-tat strikes that appeared to be spiraling out of control.
    


            The day, known as “Youm-e-Tashakur” in Urdu, is being observed to offer gratitude to Allah, pay tribute to the armed forces, and celebrate national unity, according to a statement released by the prime minister's office.
    


            “'Operation Bunyan Marsus' gave an effective and comprehensive reply to the enemy's aggression,” the statement said, referring to the military operation which Pakistan launched Sunday, after it said India targeted multiple military bases.
    


            In remarks delivered Saturday, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the nation's forces “made military history” in their fight against India, and expressed gratitude to the country's allies in helping to establish a truce.
    


            Pakistan's foreign ministry late on Saturday local time said the country “remains committed to a faithful implementation of the ceasefire” announced with India earlier in the day, amid accusations of ceasefire violations from both sides.
    


            The foreign ministry statement accused India of committing violations of the truce “in some areas,” without giving specific details, but said Pakistan's armed forces handled the situation with “responsibility and restraint.”
    


            Pakistan said it believed that any issues in implementing the ceasefire should be addressed through communication at the “appropriate levels” and urged troops on the ground to exercise discretion.
    


            Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said his forces “made military history” in their fight against India after the two sides reached a ceasefire agreement on Saturday.
    


            In a televised address late Saturday night local time, the leader did not address reports of explosions in Kashmir or respond to allegations from India's foreign secretary, who accused Pakistan of violating the countries' nascent truce.
    


            Instead, he focused on applauding Pakistan's military response and expressing gratitude for his country's allies.
    


                    “In recent days what the enemy has done was shameful and cowardly. Our brave army in a spectacular fashion made military history,” Sharif said, adding, “In a few hours our jets silenced India's guns in a way that history will not soon forget.”
                





            Sharif thanked US President Donald Trump for mediating the ceasefire talks, after a day in which Islamabad and New Delhi diverged in describing the significance of Washington's role in securing the truce.
    


            Sharif also thanked the leaders of China, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Qatar and the United Kingdom for their efforts in helping establish the ceasefire.
    


            “Our forces have been rewarded with the most magnificent honor and pride,” Sharif said as he thanked Pakistan's military leadership.
    


            A top Pakistani government official rejected Indian claims that Pakistan had violated a ceasefire with India.
    


            “Violation of ceasefire agreement from our side is out of question,” Pakistan's Information Minister Attaullah Tarar told Pakistani news channel Geo News.
    


            “The people of Pakistan were celebrating their victory against India,” Tarar said.
    


            India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri accused Pakistan of repeatedly violating the ceasefire agreement on Saturday, after explosions were heard in both the India- and Pakistan-administered parts of Kashmir.
    


            “For the last few hours there have been repeated violations of the understanding arrived at earlier this evening between the directors general of military operations of India and Pakistan,” Misri said in a televised address Saturday night.
    


                    “This is a breach of the understanding arrived at earlier today. The armed forces are giving an adequate and appropriate response and take very serious notice of these violations,” he said.
                





            Misri said India is calling on Pakistan to take “appropriate steps to address these violations and deal with the situation with seriousness and responsibility.” He added that India's military has been instructed to “deal strongly” with violations of the ceasefire along the border and the Line of Control in Kashmir.
    


            Pakistan has not yet publicly responded to Misri's allegations. Pakistan's prime minister is scheduled to speak late this evening local time.
    


            The sounds of multiple explosions were heard over Pakistan-administered Kashmir early Saturday evening local time.
    


            In videos shared with CNN from the Bhimber district, dozens of explosions can be heard reverberating through the sky in rapid bursts. The videos also appear to show specks of light, possibly projectiles flying through the air.
    


            A local government source told CNN that the explosions were attacks from the Indian side of the Line of Control, the mutually agreed upon ceasefire line in Kashmir.
    


            CNN is unable to verify these claims and has reached out to the Pakistan and Indian militaries for comment.
    


Here's the view on the ground, from a video obtained by CNN:



Explosions on the Indian side: This comes after blasts rocked Srinagar in India-administered Kashmir earlier Saturday.  Witnesses and at least one Indian government official in Kashmir and the border states of Punjab and Gujarat also reported drone sightings and the sound of nearby explosions.
    


CNN's Esha Mitra contributed reporting to this post.



            Pakistan is prepared to engage in “constructive diplomacy” with India, the country's foreign ministry said today, adding that it wants to resolve all issues “including the Jammu and Kashmir Dispute, through peaceful means.”
    


            The lengthy written statement — issued in the hours after a ceasefire had been agreed between India and Pakistan — sought to explain and clarify Islamabad's actions and motivations in recent days.
    


                    “Despite facing blatant Indian aggression and persistent provocations, Pakistan exercised great restraint. However, it was constrained to respond to ensure the safety and security of its people,” according to the statement.
                





            The ministry also said Pakistan is calling on the international community to play its part in preventing any further escalations between the two nuclear-armed states.
    


            A core group of top US officials — including Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State and interim national security adviser Marco Rubio and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles — had been closely monitoring the escalating conflict between India and Pakistan when on Friday morning, the US received alarming intelligence, Trump administration officials told CNN.
    


            While they declined to describe the nature of the information, citing its sensitivity, they said it was critical in persuading the three officials that the US should escalate its involvement.
    


            Vance himself would call Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
    


Behind the scenes: Vance briefed President Donald Trump on the plan, then spoke with Modi at noon eastern time on Friday, making clear to the Indian prime minister that the White House believed there was a high probability for dramatic escalation as the conflict went into the weekend, the administration officials said. Vance encouraged Modi to have his country communicate with Pakistan directly and to consider options available for de-escalation, the officials said.
    


            At that point, the officials said, the US believed the two sides were not talking, and they needed to get them back to the bargaining table. Vance also outlined to Modi a potential off-ramp that the US understood the Pakistanis would be amenable to, the officials said, though they did not offer details.
    


            Following the call, State Department officials, including Rubio, began working the phones with their counterparts in India and Pakistan through the night, the sources said.
    


            The Trump administration was not involved in helping draft the agreement, the administration officials said, and viewed their role mostly as getting the two sides together to talk. But from the US perspective, Vance's call to Modi was a critical moment.
    


            Strong blasts were heard across the city of Srinagar in India-administered Kashmir just hours after a ceasefire was announced between India and Pakistan.
    


            “What the hell just happened to the ceasefire? Explosions heard across Srinagar,” Omar Abdullah, chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, said in a post on X.
    


            A CNN stringer reported a host of explosions on Saturday evening local time followed by a blackout. The cause of the blasts was not immediately clear.
    


The explosions can be heard in this video posted by Abdullah:



            The India-Pakistan conflict was taking a dramatic turn for the worse, pitching the nuclear-armed neighbors into a dangerous spiral of tit-for-tat strikes.
    


            Then, out of the blue, President Donald Trump on Saturday said the US had brokered an end to the fighting. On his Truth Social platform, he made the surprise announcement that India and Pakistan had agreed to a “full and immediate” ceasefire — all the more unexpected as, just days before, Vice President JD Vance insisted the conflict was “fundamentally, none of our business.”
    


            But escalating attacks deep inside Indian and Pakistani territory seem to have focused minds. Just hours before, India had struck Pakistani military bases, provoking a furious retaliation from Pakistan, which launched rockets, artillery and drone strikes on dozens of locations in India.
    


            There are conflicting accounts of how the ceasefire was negotiated. While Islamabad praised US involvement, New Delhi downplayed it, saying the neighbors had worked together “directly” on the truce.
    


            Whatever the US role was exactly, the White House was probably pushing on an open door. It is in neither India's nor Pakistan's interest for the conflict, sparked by a terror attack in disputed Kashmir last month, to continue.
    


            The truce is also exactly the kind of quick deal Trump hoped he could secure elsewhere, such as in Ukraine, where conflict has been dragging on for nearly three and a half years. In comparison, the most recently intensified fighting between India and Pakistan seems to be over after just three and a half days.
    


            US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that the ceasefire reached between India and Pakistan was a result of several conversations between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance over the past 48 hours between top officials in each country.
    


            “It was a beautiful partnership,” Bruce said on News Nation. “This was the result of the Vice President JD Vance, of course, this entire government moving through the vision and implementing the insight and vision of President Trump along with of course, my guy, Secretary of State Marco Rubio.”
    


What India and Pakistan say: India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, however, did not mention US involvement when announcing the agreement, and an Indian statement said the deal was worked out “directly” between the two countries. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump claimed this morning that the ceasefire was brokered by the US.
    


            But a Pakistani government source familiar with the negotiations told CNN that the US — and Rubio in particular — played a crucial role in getting both sides to agree.
    


                    “It's been a long 48 hours, but this is the point of what we do,” Bruce continued. “Multiple phone calls at multiple levels with each government were had, certainly with the prime ministers over this period of time. Back-and-forth conversations and both, again JD Vance, our vice president, and the secretary of state clearly making a difference.”
                





            “We look forward to hopefully managing more conversations and having this endure,” she added.
    


            Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked US President Donald Trump for his role in brokering a ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan, as the two countries offer differing accounts on Washington's involvement in the talks.
    


            “We thank President Trump for his leadership and proactive role for peace in the region,” Sharif wrote on X, about three hours after Trump first announced the ceasefire.
    


                    “Pakistan appreciates the United States for facilitating this outcome, which we have accepted in the interest of regional peace and stability,” Sharif said, adding that Saturday's agreement could beckon “a new beginning” for peace in the region.
                





            Sharif also thanked Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio for their “valuable contributions.”
    


            Since the ceasefire was announced, the Indian government has downplayed the US' reported efforts, while Pakistani officials have amplified them.
    


            After an intense day of fighting that threatened to spiral out of control, India and Pakistan unexpectedly agreed to an immediate ceasefire, halting the worst fighting in decades between the nuclear-armed neighbors.
    


            Although the United States has claimed credit for the agreement, questions remain about how it was reached — and whether it will last.
    


Here are the latest developments:



            As a ceasefire was announced between India and Pakistan on Saturday, President Donald Trump hailed the role of the United States in mediating, and Pakistan praised it — but India downplayed it.
    


            In their long history of tensions, India and Pakistan have both viewed foreign intervention differently:
    


            “India has never accepted mediation in any dispute, be it India-Pakistan or India-China, or any other,” according to Aparna Pande, research fellow for India and South Asia at the Hudson Institute.
    


                    “So yes, India welcomes international pressure on Pakistan, but it will never state that there was a role by any other country or international organization,” she said.
                





            “Pakistan, on the other hand, has always sought international mediation, so they will praise it,” she added, saying it is “the only way it can put pressure on India to discuss and resolve the Kashmir dispute.”
    


Some context on Kashmir: The territory has been a flashpoint in India-Pakistan relations since both gained their independence from Britain in 1947.
    


            The ruler of Kashmir initially decided to remain independent, choosing not to become a part of either Pakistan or India. After militants from Pakistan invaded, he signed a letter acceding to India. Pakistan did not recognize the letter as a legal document, sparking war. In 1949, the two countries agree to withdraw all troops behind a mutually agreed ceasefire line, later known as the Line of Control.
    


            To this day, both India and Pakistan claim Kashmir in full and have fought multiple wars over it.
    


            A Pakistani government source familiar with the negotiations that led to a truce with India said that the United States played a crucial role in them.
    


            The agreement came after an intense day of fighting that left both sides fearing the tit-for-tat strikes could spiral out of control, the source told CNN, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
    


Shock over strikes: The source said both sides were progressing toward an agreement on Friday, but said that Islamabad was blindsided by New Delhi's targeting three Pakistani air bases with air-to-surface missiles early Saturday morning local time.
    


            Pakistan's government believed that a diplomatic off-ramp had been close and was shocked by the strikes, the source said.
    


            In response, Pakistan fired back a much bigger salvo that targeted air bases in India, as well as military targets near the line of control in the disputed Kashmir region. “An eye for an eye,” the Pakistani military said in a statement Saturday morning.
    


            The source said that New Delhi had been shocked by the scale of Pakistan's response, and that both sides then “got serious” about engaging in peace talks later Saturday.
    


            Even as the talks kicked into high gear, the source said India fired more rockets, with Pakistan responding. But US assurances meant that the talks continued, the source added.
    


US steps in: US Secretary of State Marco Rubio played a “monumental role” in mediating the discussions, according to the source, who said that officials from Saudi Arabia and Turkey were also involved.
    


            By mid-afternoon, neither side had launched fresh strikes. Two hours later, the ceasefire was announced, the source said.
    


            The source was not sure how Rubio convinced India to agree to the deal. Indian officials have, however, downplayed the influence of US officials in brokering the agreement, with a source saying the truce was worked out “directly” with Pakistan.
    


            UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy hailed the ceasefire announced by India and Pakistan as “hugely welcome.”
    


            “I urge both parties to sustain this. De-escalation is in everybody's interest,” he added in a post on X.
    


            Meanwhile, the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Issues Kaja Kallas said the announced ceasefire “is a vital step toward de-escalation.”
    


            She added: “All efforts must be made to ensure it is respected.”
    


            Pakistan has fully reopened its airspace for all fights across the country, following a ceasefire announcement between Pakistan and India.
    


            A spokesperson for Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) earlier said the country had closed its airspace to all air traffic — including civilian flights — starting at 3:15 a.m. local time on Saturday (6:15 p.m. Friday ET) until noon local time.
    


            The ceasefire between India and Pakistan was agreed to “directly” between the two countries, India's Ministry of External Affairs said Saturday, echoing what a source on the Indian side told CNN earlier.
    


            The statement, which was shared on social media by the Indian government, comes despite US President Donald Trump's announcement that the ceasefire was the result of a night of US mediation.
    


            According to the Indian statement, an agreement was reached after Pakistan's director general of military operations initiated a phone call Saturday afternoon local time.
    


                    “The stoppage of firing and military action between India and Pakistan was worked out directly between the two countries,” reads the statement, which was shared by India's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.
                





            An Indian source had previously provided the same statement to CNN.
    


On potential future talks: The Indian government also said there had been no decision reached to hold talks “on any other issue at any other place.”
    


            A readout from the US State Department had said Secretary of State Marco Rubio offered help to mediate “in order to avoid future conflicts,” and Rubio wrote on X that the two sides had agreed to “start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.”
    


            India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri has also said that the directors general of military operations of the two countries are scheduled to speak again on Monday.
    


What Islamabad is saying: Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said in an X post shortly after Trump's announcement that “Pakistan and India have agreed to a ceasefire with immediate effect.” Rubio held a call with Dar as well.
    


This post has been updated to reflect a statement from the Indian government and additional comments from Rubio.



            India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri confirmed India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire, which came into effect starting at 5 p.m. local time (7:30 a.m. ET).
    


            During a news conference, Misri said that Pakistan's Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) held a phone call with his Indian counterpart earlier on Saturday afternoon local time. During the call, it was agreed that both sides “would stop all firing and military action” from 5 p.m. Indian Standard Time.
    


            Misri added that the directors general of the two countries are scheduled to speak again on Monday.
    


            India said an “understanding” was reached between New Delhi and Islamabad to stop the military action that had erupted between the two neighbors, according to sources on the Indian side.
    


            “The stoppage of firing and military action between India and Pakistan was worked out directly between the two countries,” a source said.
    


            They continued that Pakistan's director general of military operations (DGMO) initiated a call on Saturday afternoon local time, “after which discussions took place and understanding reached.”
    


            “There is no decision to hold talks on any other issue at any other place,” the source added.
    


            US President Donald Trump announced earlier on his Truth Social platform that the two sides had agreed to a “full and immediate ceasefire,” which was confirmed by Pakistan's foreign minister on X minutes later.
    


            Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said that Pakistan and India have agreed to a ceasefire “with immediate effect,” confirming US President Donald Trump's announcement on his Truth Social platform.
    


            “Pakistan has always strived for peace and security in the region, without compromising on its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Dar added, in a post on X.
    


            The surprise ceasefire announcement came after India and Pakistan continued to accuse the other of strikes overnight into Saturday.
    


            US Vice President JD Vance, who just days ago claimed the conflict between India and Pakistan was “none of our business,” has also shared President Donald Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed countries.
    


            In an interview with Fox News on Thursday, Vance had downplayed the potential for US influence as the India-Pakistan conflict spiraled.
    


            “What we can do is try to encourage these folks to deescalate a little bit, but we're not going to get involved in the middle of war that's fundamentally none of our business and has nothing to do with America's ability to control it,” Vance told Fox News on Thursday.
    


            “You know, America can't tell the Indians to lay down their arms. We can't tell the Pakistanis to lay down their arms. And so, we're going to continue to pursue this thing through diplomatic channels,” Vance said.
    


            Vance shared a screenshot of Trump's Truth Social post announcing the ceasefire on Saturday, but did not immediately provide further comment.
    


            Pakistan's foreign minister and Indian sources confirmed the halt in fighting shortly after Trump's surprise announcement.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio says India and Pakistan showed “prudence” in agreeing to a ceasefire after a spate of deadly attacks against each other that brought them close to a broader conflict.
    


            “I am pleased to announce the Governments of India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire and to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site,” Rubio wrote Saturday on X, minutes after President Donald Trump first announced the ceasefire with a post on Truth Social.
    


            Rubio praised Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Shehbaz Sharif for “their wisdom, prudence, and statesmanship in choosing the path of peace.”
    


            Earlier Saturday, Rubio spoke with the foreign ministers of both countries, the State Department said.
    


            Pakistan has confirmed the truce but there has been no comment yet from India.
    


            India and Pakistan have agreed to a “full and immediate ceasefire” following a night of talks mediated by the US, President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Saturday.
    


            “After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE,” the US president said.
    


            “Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence.”
    


            Neither side has commented yet on Trump's statement - we'll bring you the latest as we get it.
    


            Pakistan's Prime Minister said that retaliatory strikes against India on Saturday had specifically targeted military infrastructure New Delhi had used to launch its earlier attacks in “a powerful and well-coordinated response.”
    


            Earlier Saturday, Pakistan's military said it launched an operation against India, in retaliation to India launching missiles at key military bases, including one close to the capital Islamabad.Hours later, explosions were reported in India-administered Kashmir, including Srinagar, the region's largest city, and the city of Jammu.
    


            The cause of the blasts was not immediately clear.
    


            Pakistan launched the strikes on Saturday as part of ‘Operation Banyan al-Marsous,' Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif said in a statement issued by his office.
    


            Sharif said Pakistan had on Saturday given “a powerful and well-coordinated response to India's unprovoked aggression,” and accused India of launching “missile and drone attacks on Pakistan, targeting Noor Khan Airbase and other locations early this morning, killing innocent civilians.”
    


                    “Today, we have delivered a resounding reply and avenged the blood of the innocent,” Sharif said. “We are proud of our armed forces.”
                





            The information minister for Pakistan-administered Kashmir said that 11 people were killed, including a child, and 56 others were injured in “intense” overnight Indian shelling along the Line of Control (LoC).
    


            “Last night, intense shelling from the Indian side took place at more than five different locations along the Line of Control,” Pir Mazhar Saeed Shah said Saturday.
    


                    “As a result, 11 people, including a child and four women, lost their lives, and 56 others were injured.”
                





            He continued that, so far, 1,014 people have been relocated from the LoC – the de-facto border separating the India- and Pakistan-administered parts of the disputed territory that has been a flashpoint in the recent hostilities – to safer areas.
    


            In Pakistan-administered Kashmir, Indian shelling has damaged 235 homes, 29 of which have been completely destroyed, Shah said. He added that two small hospitals along the LoC were also targeted by Indian shelling, causing partial structural damage to the buildings.
    


            The latest confrontation between India and Pakistan continued Saturday, with Islamabad launching a military operation in retaliation to what it said were Indian strikes on its military bases overnight. India's military said it “effectively countered and responded” to Pakistan's operation.
    


            Witnesses have recounted the moment blasts were heard in Srinagar, India-controlled Kashmir's largest city, on Saturday morning.
    


            Explosions were reported in India-administered Kashmir, including Srinagar, the region's largest city, and the city of Jammu, on Saturday morning. The cause of the blasts was not immediately clear.
    


            Local residents living near the city's airport told CNN they heard multiple blasts in their vicinity. A Reuters witness reported that the explosions were heard near the city's airport and the local army headquarters.
    


                    “I heard sounds of three blasts one after the other from the airport. This happened around noon. I was at my home with family when we heard all this and were caught off guard,” 28-year-old Rafique Ahmed, who lives close to the airport, told CNN. 
                





            Ahmed continued, “Earlier in the morning, I had heard around 5:45 a.m. there were sounds of blasts as well. There were sirens that followed these explosions.”
    


            “We are staying inside our house to be safe. Let's see what happens.”
    


            Another witness, Madeeha, who lives just over a mile from the airport, said, “I heard these blasting sounds early morning around 5:45 a.m. first and then around noon as well around.”
    


                    Madeeha continued, “We all got frightened this morning. We rushed down to the ground floor to stay there. Based on our own experience we know that we need to rush to the lower floors for security reasons, as the higher floors are more likely to get hit.”
                





            India's military said Pakistan's retaliatory military operation against India targeted “places of worship” including a Hindu temple.
    


            “Multiple armed drones have been sent through the night, endangering civilians and religious sites,” India's defense ministry wrote in a statement on X.
    


            One of the places targeted was the Shambhu Temple, a popular religious site in Jammu city in India-administered Kashmir. Residential areas in Jammu were also targeted, the statement said.
    


            Early Saturday, Pakistan said it launched an operation against India, in retaliation to India launching missiles at key military bases, including one close to the capital Islamabad.
    


            Explosions were reported in India-administered Kashmir, including Srinagar, the region's largest city, and the city of Jammu.
    


            Indian officials confirmed the death of at least one person on Saturday as a result of Pakistan's military operations.
    


            The Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir confirmed a government official, district development commissioner Raj Kumar Thappa, was killed in shelling on the city of Rajouri in India-administered Kashmir.
    


            “I've no words to express my shock & sadness at this terrible loss of life. May his soul rest in peace,” Minister Omar Abdullah wrote in a post on X.
    


            India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri also confirmed Thappa's death, telling reporters in a news conference that his death added “to the civilian casualties and the damage in that state.”
    


            Pakistan and India launched retaliatory military operations on each other on Saturday, escalating the conflict further, after days of accusing each other of taking escalatory steps.
    


            Islamabad said early Saturday it had launched an operation against India, in retaliation to India launching missiles at key military bases. Pakistan said its air defenses had intercepted most of India's missiles.
    


            Later, India's Wing Commander Vyomika Singh said Pakistan “targeted civilian areas and military infrastructure,” including medical and educational buildings in India-administered Kashmir, while speaking during the news briefing alongside other senior officials.
    


            Pakistan has not responded to comments made during the news briefing.
    


            The weeks-long confrontation between India and Pakistan escalated further on Saturday, with Islamabad launching a military operation in retaliation to what it said were Indian strikes on its military bases overnight.
    


            The nuclear-armed neighbors are now locked in their most expansive military conflict in decades, even as the international community calls for calm and restraint.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has offered Washington's help in mediating amid the escalations.
    


            Here's what to know about the latest exchanges:
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio offered US mediation in the escalating conflict between Pakistan and India while speaking separately with his counterparts in both countries, according to State Department readouts.
    


            Rubio spoke with India's External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar in separate calls, during which he “emphasized that both sides need to identify methods to de-escalate and re-establish direct communication to avoid miscalculation,” according to the readouts.
    


            He also spoke earlier with Pakistani army chief Asim Munir, during which he “continued to urge both parties to find ways” to de-escalate.
    


            The secretary of state offered US help to mediate “in order to avoid future conflicts,” the readout said.
    


            This is the first such offer of US assistance mentioned in readouts of his calls with Pakistani or Indian officials.
    


            Pakistan's foreign minister said Saturday that if India stops its escalatory actions, so will Islamabad.
    


            “If there is an iota of sanity, India will stop and if they stop, so will we,” Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on camera while speaking with a local TV station.
    


                    “We genuinely want peace without the hegemony of any one country,” Dar said.
                





            His comments come after India and Pakistan launched a fresh round of military operations on each other on Saturday and accused each other of taking escalatory steps.
    


            India says it “effectively countered and responded” to Pakistan's military operation early Saturday.
    


            Pakistan “targeted civilian areas and military infrastructure,” including medical and educational buildings in India-administered Kashmir, Wing Commander Vyomika Singh alleged, during a media briefing in New Delhi alongside other senior officials.
    


            “Air intrusions and several harassment attacks were attempted” at more than 26 locations along India's international border and the de facto border dividing Kasmhir between Indian and Pakistani control, Singh said.
    


            Pakistan's military “also resorted to air intrusions using drones and firing of heavy caliber weapons” along the disputed border in Kashmir, Singh said. She added Pakistan used a high-speed missile to target an air base in Punjab state, inside India's undisputed borders.
    


            The Indian army “responded effectively,” causing “extensive damage” to Pakistan army infrastructure. Singh said the Indian side sustained “limited damage.”
    


            Pakistan's military “has been observed to be moving its troops towards forward areas, indicating an offensive intent to further escalation,” the Indian commander said. “Indian armed forces remain in a high state of operational readiness, and all hostile actions have been effectively countered and responded proportionately.”
    


            Pakistan has not responded to comments made during the news briefing.
    


            Earlier, Pakistan said it launched a retaliatory operation against India after India launched strikes on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, against what it called “terrorist infrastructure.”
    


            No questions were taken during the news briefing.
    


This post has been updated with additional information.



            China said it is “deeply concerned” about escalating tensions between India and Pakistan, and vowed to play a “constructive role” in de-escalation.
    


            “China is closely following the current situation between India and Pakistan and is deeply concerned about the escalation,” a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday.
    


            “We strongly urge both sides to prioritize the broader interest of peace and stability, remain calm and restrained, and return to the path of political resolution through peaceful means,” the spokesperson added.
    


                    “Avoiding further escalation is in the fundamental interests of both India and Pakistan, conducive to regional peace and stability, and aligns with the expectations of the international community. China stands ready to continue playing a constructive role in this regard.”
                





Some context: China, which borders both India and Pakistan, has repeatedly called for calm and restraint amid the looming risk of war on its doorstep. Its Foreign Ministry expressed regret and concern on Wednesday after India launched strikes on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, against what it called “terrorist infrastructure.”
    


            Late last month, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi expressed support for Pakistan in a phone call with his counterpart, calling China an “ironclad friend” of Pakistan's.
    


            Pakistan is Beijing's “all-weather strategic partner” and a key participant in Chinese leader Xi Jinping's signature global infrastructure project, the Belt and Road Initiative. China is Pakistan's primary arms supplier, accounting for 81% of the country's weapons imports over the past five years.
    


            The International Monetary Fund's executive board on Friday approved an approximately $1 billion loan disbursement to Pakistan, a relief for the country facing a lingering economic crisis and now an escalating conflict with India.
    


            The immediate disbursement comes as part of a $7 billion bailout Pakistan secured from the IMF after years of negotiations, according to a statement.
    


            The IMF also approved a new $1.4 billion under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility, its climate resilience fund — but those funds will not be released yet.
    


            While Pakistan had long been working to secure this deal, India asked the IMF for a broader review of its loans to Islamabad earlier this month, as the conflict heightened.
    


Delhi's objection: India said it raised concerns at the IMF meeting Friday about “the possibility of misuse of debt financing funds for state sponsored cross border terrorism,” according to a press release from the Indian Ministry of Finance.
    


Some context: The loan disbursement comes as Pakistan's economy has been suffering major challenges in recent years, including a debt crisis and economic turmoil as a result of political instability and climate catastrophes. A military stand-off with India would threaten any progress.
    


            “Sustained escalation in tensions with India would likely weigh on Pakistan's growth and hamper the government's ongoing fiscal consolidation, setting back Pakistan's progress in achieving macroeconomic stability,” credit agency Moody's said in a report earlier this week, according to the Reuters news agency.
    


            “A persistent increase in tensions could also impair Pakistan's access to external financing and pressure its foreign-exchange reserves,” it added.
    


            The escalating conflict between India and Pakistan has reached “alarming proportions,” one analyst has said, after Islamabad said it launched an operation against its neighbor in retaliation to recent “Indian aggression.”
    


            “This crisis has reached alarming proportions,” said Washington-based South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman, adding there seem to be “no immediate off-ramps in site.”
    


            Pakistan's military said early Saturday it had launched an operation against India in retaliation to India launching missiles at key military bases, including one close to the capital Islamabad.
    


            The rapid escalation of conflict between the neighboring states was sparked by a massacre of tourists last month in India-controlled Kashmir.
    


            India and Pakistan have already fought three wars over Kashmir, a contested region they both claim in its entirety, with each controlling a part. Another conflict could have catastrophic consequences.
    


                    “Each round of tit-for-tat strikes takes India and Pakistan further up the escalation ladder, but neither side appears willing to claim victory and call it a day,” said Kugelman.
                





            “The escalation dynamics are extremely concerning here.”
    


            Explosions have been reported in India-administered Kashmir, hours after Pakistan said it launched a retaliatory military operation against its neighbor.
    


            At least two blasts were heard early Saturday in Srinagar, the largest city in India-administered Kashmir, a journalist on the ground told CNN.
    


            The sound of explosions was also heard in the city of Jammu, a resident and former top police official for India-controlled Kashmir, Shesh Paul Vaid, told the Associated Press.
    


            The cause of the blasts was not immediately clear.
    


            The Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir on Friday night appealed to people in and around the city of Jammu to stay at home.
    


                    “It's my earnest appeal to everyone in & around Jammu please stay off the streets, stay at home or at the nearest place you can comfortably stay at for the next few hours,” Omar Abdullah wrote on X.
                





            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Pakistani army chief Asim Munir on Friday and offered US mediation, according to a State Department readout.
    


            Rubio “continued to urge both parties to find ways to deescalate,” the readout said, adding that he offered US assistance “in starting constructive talks in order to avoid future conflicts.”
    


            This is the first such offer of US assistance mentioned in readouts of his calls with Pakistani or Indian officials.
    


            India is currently responding to Pakistani attacks, an Indian official with knowledge of the matter told CNN's Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Matthew Chance.
    


            “All Pakistani attacks are being responded to appropriately by the Indian Armed Forces,” the official said.
    


            The Pakistani military said early Saturday it had begun an operation against India in retaliation against recent “Indian aggression,” saying
    


            India had launched missiles at key military bases
    


            .
    


            Pakistan's military claims it has hit multiple targets in India and India-administered Kashmir.
    


            Here are some Indian military targets they say they have struck:
    


            Most of these locations are near or along the de facto border that divides the disputed Kashmir region between New Delhi and Islamabad. Pathankot, in Punjab state, and Suratgarh, in Rajasthan state, are airfields inside India's undisputed borders.
    


            The Pakistan military said that, in an “eye for eye” retaliation, they targeted the Indian air bases that were used to launch missiles against Pakistan.
    


            CNN cannot independently verify Pakistan's claim regarding India's strikes. CNN has reached out to India's Ministry of Defense and the Indian Air Force for a response.
    


            The Pakistani military said it launched an operation against India on Saturday morning in retaliation to recent “Indian aggression.”
    


            The announcement came shortly after Pakistan said India had attacked several of its military air bases. Right after Pakistan made this claim, its government posted on X to say that “India must now prepare for Pakistan's response.”
    


            CNN cannot independently verify this claim. CNN has reached out to India's Ministry of Defense and the Indian Air Force for a response.
    


What Islamabad says about Indian strikes in Pakistani territory:



            CNN cannot independently verify the Pakistani military claim. CNN is seeking comment from the Indian military.
    


Airspace closure: Pakistan closed its airspace to all air traffic on Saturday, according to a Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) spokesperson. The closure, which started at 3:15 a.m. local time (6.15 p.m. Friday EST), will apply to all civilian flights in the country until noon local time Saturday.
    


Kashmir has been a flashpoint in India-Pakistan relations since both gained their independence from Britain in 1947. The two nations to emerge from the bloody partition of British India — Muslim-majority Pakistan and Hindu-majority India — both claim Kashmir in full, and months after becoming independent, fought their first of three wars over the territory.
    


Here's a quick recap:



1947: India and Pakistan gain independence from Britain. The ruler of Kashmir initially decides to remain independent, choosing not to become a part of either Pakistan or India. After militants from Pakistan invade, he signs a letter acceding to India. Pakistan does not recognize the letter as a legal document, sparking war. In 1949, the two countries agree to withdraw all troops behind a mutually agreed ceasefire line, later known as the Line of Control.
    


1965: India and Pakistan go to war again over Kashmir. The clash did not resolve the dispute over the territory.
    


1971: This was the biggest war fought between the two countries, which led to a humiliating loss for Pakistan and the creation of the state of Bangladesh from the region formerly known as East Pakistan.
    


1999: India and Pakistan fight a limited border conflict in Kashmir, after armed invaders from Pakistan cross the Line of Control in the town of Kargil.
    


            India on Wednesday said it launched a military operation against Pakistan, hitting “terrorist infrastructure” in both Pakistan and Pakistan administered-Kashmir, in a major escalation of tensions between the two neighbors and in response to an attack on tourists in India-administered Kashmir on April 22.
    


Here's what you need to know about the attack in Kashmir:



What happened: Gunmen opened fire on tourists in a popular travel destination in the mountainous destination of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. At least 25 Indian citizens and one Nepali national were killed in the massacre, which unfolded in a valley only accessible by foot or on horseback. Eyewitnesses described scenes of horror as the gunmen approached, opening fire on people from close range. Some recalled how the men among the group were singled out and shot at. Other survivors told local media the gunmen accused some of the victims of supporting India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
    


Who claimed responsibility: Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front (TRF), claimed responsibility for the attack on social media but it has reportedly since walked back that claim, according to multiple local media reports. Pakistan has denied involvement. India has not publicly blamed any group for the attack but has justified its retaliatory moves as a response to Pakistan's alleged “support for cross-border terrorism.”
    


Some background: India has long accused Pakistan of harboring Islamist militant groups that target Kashmir, something Islamabad denies. Attacks by militants have in the past led to a sharp escalation of tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, both of whom have rival claims to the Himalayan region. India conducted air strikes inside Pakistan in 2019 following an insurgent attack on Indian soldiers.
    


            Kashmir has been a flashpoint in India-Pakistan relations since both gained their independence from Britain in 1947.
    


            The two nations to emerge from the bloody partition of British India both claim Kashmir in full, and months after becoming independent, fought their first of three wars over the territory.
    


            The divided region is now one of the most militarized places in the world.
    


            For decades, several domestic militant groups, demanding either independence for Kashmir or for the area to become part of Pakistan, have fought Indian security forces, leaving tens of thousands killed in the violence.
    


            But attacks on tourists in the picturesque Himalayan region are rare.
    


            Tensions between India and Pakistan over Kashmir have surged in recent years, after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government revoked its constitutional autonomy in 2019, bringing it under the direct control of New Delhi.
    


            By the numbers, India's military would be seen as superior to Pakistan's in any conventional conflict.
    


            The Indian defense budget is more than nine times Pakistan's, according to this year's edition of “The Military Balance,” an assessment of armed forces by the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
    


            That budget supports an active-duty Indian force of almost 1.5 million personnel, compared to 660,000 for Pakistan.
    


On the ground, India's 1.2 million-strong army has 3,750 main battle tanks and more than 10,000 artillery pieces, while Pakistan's tank force is only two-thirds of India's and Islamabad has fewer than half of the artillery pieces in New Delhi's arsenal.
    


At sea, the Indian navy's advantage is overwhelming. It has two aircraft carriers, 12 guided-missile destroyers, 11 guided-missile frigates and 16 attack submarines.
    


            Pakistan has no carriers and no guided-missile destroyers, with 11 smaller guided-missile frigates being the backbone of its naval fleet. It also has only half the number of subs that India fields.
    


            Both air forces rely heavily on older Soviet-era aircraft, including MiG-21s in India and the Chinese equivalent – the J-7 – in Pakistan.
    


            India has been investing in multirole French-made Rafale jets, with 36 now in service, according to “The Military Balance.”
    


            Pakistan has added Chinese J-10 multirole jets, with more than 20 now in its fleet.
    


            Though Pakistan still has dozens of US-made F-16 fighters, the backbone of its fleet has become the JF-17, a joint project with China that came online in the early 2000s. About 150 are in service.
    


            Russian-made aircraft play a significant role in India's air fleet, with more than 100 MiG-29 fighters in service with the air force and navy combined, plus over 260 Su-30 ground attack jets.
    


            The rivals are closer in capabilities when it comes to nuclear forces, with around five dozen surface-to-surface launchers each, though Indian has longer-range ballistic missiles than Pakistan.

The remains of three people were discovered at a site in northern Syria on Sunday, according to the Jerusalem Post. 

The identities have yet to be confirmed, and it was not known if any were Americans.

The State Department did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for confirmation.

Syria has previously denied claims it abducted or held Americans, though the U.S. reportedly engaged in back-channel talks with Syria with the help of Lebanese intermediaries for years, including under the Biden administration, to no avail.

Rebels seized the capital city of Damascus in December, ousting Assad and renewing hope in the effort to free any potential captives.

Comedian Alli Breen and Fox Nation host Abby Hornacek discuss the disparity in money spent on parents.

EXCLUSIVE: Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., will put forward the MOMS (More Opportunities for Mothers to Succeed) Act on Tuesday, aiming to provide critical support to America's mothers, both prenatal and post-partum, as Mother's Day arrives Sunday.

Britt said the number of births in the U.S. in 2023 was the lowest since the Carter administration, citing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

""The Republican Party is the party of life, the party of parents, and the party of families,"" she added to Fox News Digital.

""At the heart of the MOMS Act is building a comprehensive culture of life to give moms, children and families the support system they need to thrive and live their American Dream.""

5 HIGH TECH MOTHERS DAY GIFTS THAT SHOW YOU REALLY CARE

""As a mom myself, I don't have to wonder what other moms are facing – I'm living it. I know firsthand that there is no greater blessing in life than our children and I also understand the types of challenges that women face during their pregnancy journeys and while raising their kids. I'm proud to support women throughout these seasons of motherhood, and the MOMS Act is part of my continued commitment to fight on their behalf.

Britt is joined on the bill by Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and several dads as well, including Sens. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., Steve Daines, R-Mont., Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., David McCormick, R-Pa., Charles Grassley, R-Iowa and others.

McCormick told Fox News Digital he was proud to join such a ""pro-family effort,"" while warning that the U.S. birth and fertility rates have been ""alarmingly low"" for some time.

""I'm proud to join [my] colleagues in this pro-family effort to help ensure new and expecting mothers can access the resources they need for the long-term health and well-being of themselves and their children,"" he said.

The MOMS Act would establish a new ""pregnancy-dot-gov"" for expectant and post-partum mothers as well as those with young children, in order to increase access to adoption agencies, pregnancy resource centers and other assistance by ZIP code.

For states like Alabama, where rural communities are especially in need of such support, it would establish a grant program that would help assuage the more than 20 counties in the Yellowhammer State alone that are considered ""maternity care deserts.""

Britt's last attempt at putting forward MOMS Act legislation was blocked by Democrats whom she said had erroneously characterized the bill as creating a federal pregnancy database, among other ""outlandish"" claims.

The 2025 version also includes Cramer's Unborn Child Support Act to allow state governments to apply child support obligations during gestation.

While no Democrats have yet come out in public support, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine recently co-sponsored the Child Care Availability and Affordability Act with Britt to strengthen tax credits aimed at lowering the cost of day care and the like.

Fox News contributor and Army veteran Brett Velicovich shares insight into the United States' drone capabilities and how it compares to adversaries like Russia and China.

The U.S. Marine Corps established an attack drone team earlier this year to respond to the rapid development of armed first-person view (FPV) drone technology and tactics, offering a glimpse into the evolving landscape of modern warfare and how future battles could be fought.

The Marine Corps Attack Drone Team (MCADT) will be based at the Weapons Training Battalion, Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia.

The FPV drones used will offer squad-level lethality at a range of up to 20 kilometers, nearly 12.5 miles, for under $5,000, compared to more expensive weapons systems with less capability, according to a press release from the service.

""MCADT is committed to rapidly integrating armed first-person view drones into the FMF [Fleet Marine Force], enhancing small-unit lethality and providing organic capabilities that warfighters currently lack,"" said Maj. Alejandro Tavizon, the headquarters company commander at Weapons Training Battalion and officer in charge of MCADT.

""By leveraging emerging technologies and refining drone employment tactics, we are ensuring that Marines remain agile, adaptive, and lethal in the modern battlespace.""

Brett Velicovich, an Army veteran with extensive drone experience, told Fox News Digital that the creation of MCADT has been long overdue as the United States enters a drone arms race with adversaries like China, Russia and Iran.

""For a while now, we haven't had the needed technology, the needed expertise in low-cost, highly scalable, lethal drone technology that, frankly, is going to be the next part of every piece of the next war that we fight,"" he said.

Velicovich argued that the United States is far behind other countries, especially China, when it comes to the production of drone technology, and needs to start looking at drones not just as surveillance assets, but as a form of ammunition.

He pointed to Russia's war in Ukraine and the large-scale advancements in domestic drone production that have allowed Ukrainian forces to strike multi-million-dollar enemy tanks and vehicles with drones that cost a few hundred dollars.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced in December that Ukraine manufactured over 1.5 million FPV drones in 2024, including reconnaissance, kamikaze and long-range deep-strike drones. Domestically produced drones accounted for 96.2% of all unmanned aerial vehicles used by Ukrainian forces during the year.

""You have companies and manufacturing plants in Ukraine building 100,000 drones per month. One manufacturing plant is building 100,000 of these things per month. That's real scale. That's where we need to be,"" Velicovich told Fox News Digital.

The WSJ, citing one Department of Defense estimate, reported that the U.S. has the capacity to build up to 100,000 drones a year.

US, EUROPEAN ALLIES DEMAND ACTION TO END RUSSIA'S USE OF IRANIAN DRONES IN UKRAINE

The number is far below what the United States' adversaries, such as Russia and China, produce in a year, raising national security concerns.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, speaking at a meeting of the Military-Industrial Commission in late April, said that almost all of the country's defense enterprises had met their orders in full last year, highlighting Moscow's efforts to ramp up its war machine.

""Over 1.5 million drones of various types were delivered, with about 4,000 so-called FPV drones equipped with virtual reality control systems supplied to the frontlines daily,"" Putin said, according to a transcript released by the Kremlin. ""I know well, just as many of you here do, that these weapons are still in short supply. We need more of them.""

Chinese technology company DJI is also making significant inroads in drone production, in both U.S. and Asian markets. It touts itself as the world's leading manufacturer of consumer and commercial drones.

Craig Singleton, a senior China fellow at the non-partisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital that the Shenzhen-based company dominates the global drone market, controlling more than 70% of the worldwide market share.

""That's alarming, because DJI drones are essentially data collectors for Beijing — giving China potential access to sensitive infrastructure imagery, flight patterns, and more. It's not just a market-share problem — it's a national security threat,"" he said.

AI-POWERED ATTACK DRONES TAKE FLIGHT

Singleton added that the U.S. doesn't need to match China drone for drone, but it needs a production floor that's sustainable, somewhere around a minimum of 250,000 drones per year.

""We are absolutely in a drone arms race with China — and losing isn't an option. Success will depend on scaling production, protecting sensitive supply chains, and turbocharging innovation,"" he said. ""It's not just about building drones — it's about fielding smarter, cheaper and more resilient swarms faster than Beijing.""

Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD) on Saturday called for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to resign from his Cabinet post, blasting him as an “asinine” and “dangerous” Health and Human Services secretary.

The freshman senator made the announcement at a “SICK OF IT” event outside the National Institutes of Health headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland.

“As of this Monday, I will be filing a Senate resolution and I am calling on Secretary Kennedy to resign. He must go. He ought to be fired,” Alsobrooks said.

Alsobrooks claimed Kennedy has “utterly failed” in his leadership at the top health agency in the United States, pointing to his lack of a medical background as well as his promotion of “quack” science and treatments and his stance on vaccines.

“I asked him at his hearing, do you have any medical training? The answer is no. Do you have any scientific background? The answer is no. He is unqualified to do the work that he is doing, but he spread lies and conspiracy theories about safe and effective vaccines, vaccines that literally prevent measles,” she said, referencing the measles outbreak in the U.S. that has reached 1,000 reported cases across the country.

The Maryland senator also slammed the workforce reductions at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which Kennedy has pursued as he aims to cut about a quarter of HHS's workforce. Alsobrooks claimed these cuts are not about eliminating wasteful spending and prioritizing efficiency, but are to give tax cuts for billionaires.

“Are you sick of seeing them cut funding for research? And guess why they're doing all of this? None of us are confused about it, and so they can have tax cuts for their billionaire friends. That's what this is all about. It's not about efficiency. The idea that any of this about efficiency is a bald faced lie,” she said.

Alsobrooks concluded by painting Kennedy as “in over his head” and reiterated her call for his resignation, with the crowd chanting, “He must go!”

“So we want him together to either resign or to be fired. We don't care which one, but he must resign or he must be fired. We want him to be removed. He never had the qualifications, and he's lost the confidence of the American people, and we want him to get out of there now. And I am going to keep up the pressure on this administration to uphold the oath that they swore to keep,” she added.

Alsobrooks, who formerly served as county executive of Prince George's County, became Maryland's first U.S. black senator last November after defeating former Republican Gov. Larry Logan by over 10%.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

ATLANTA (AP) — A 4.1-magnitude earthquake in Tennessee woke up families and rattled homes as far away as Atlanta as it spread tremors across portions of the southern U.S. on Saturday morning. No injuries or major damage were immediately reported.

The website for USGS said the earthquake originated shortly after 9 a.m. EDT about 12 miles from Greenback, Tennessee, which is about 30 miles south of Knoxville.

More than 23,000 reports from the public were received by USGS in the first hour after the earthquake, USGS spokeswoman Ayesha Davis told the Associated Press in an email. Meteorologists at television news stations serving Georgia and North Carolina reported feeling the tremors as well.

There is a 5% chance of a magnitude 4 or larger aftershock in the next week, according to USGS.

Gabriela Reilly was making waffles with her husband when they felt their entire home shake in Braselton, Georgia, which is northeast of Atlanta.

“Our ceiling fan started shaking for about 10 seconds,” she said. “I thought a giant aircraft had flown low right over the neighborhood, but my husband said, ‘No, that was definitely an earthquake!'”

Jason Pack was still in bed at his home outside Knoxville when he felt the walls shaking and heard a rumbling that was loud enough to wake up his family and for the dog to start barking.

“In east Tennessee, you're used to tornadoes and floods, that kind of thing,” Pack said. “It's unusual to have an earthquake.”

Pack has experienced tremors before, although this one is probably the strongest he's felt in Tennessee.

“Even though this one was small, it's a good reminder — if it had been a big quake, would you know what to do? Drop, cover, and hold on if you're inside,” said Pack, a retired FBI agent who now works in crisis communications. “Stay clear of buildings if you're outside.”

Damage does not usually occur from earthquakes until they reach a magnitude of somewhere above 4 or 5, according to USGS, although it depends on variables such as building construction, soil, and distance from the epicenter.

The southeastern U.S. carries a significant earthquake risk, particularly around the New Madrid Seismic Zone to the west and in the East Tennessee Seismic Zone, which is where Saturday's earthquake occurred, said Davis.

Since 1950, 15 other earthquakes of magnitude 4 or larger have occurred within 155 miles of Saturday's earthquake, Davis said. The largest of those was a magnitude 4.7 earthquake near Knoxville in November 1973.

More recently, two tremors struck the seismic zone in December 2018. One was a 4.4 magnitude earthquake that was centered in Decatur, Tennessee, which is south of Knoxville. It shook homes as far away as Atlanta.

Another earthquake struck a few days later with a magnitude of 3.0. Its epicenter was about two miles southeast of Mascot, near Knoxville. It also was felt in parts of Georgia, Kentucky, and North Carolina.

Seismic waves from earthquakes spread more efficiently in the Eastern U.S. compared to the West because of the region's geology, Davis said.

“Earthquakes in the East are felt over a much larger distance and by more people,” she said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

How to live longer — and healthier.

by  Bryan Walsh

After more than a century of steady, upward climb, US life expectancy hit 78.9 years in 2015. Since then, it's been mostly downhill. US life expectancy slid to 76.1 years in 2021 at the pandemic's nadir before inching back up to 78.4 years in 2023 — still well below the 2014 peak and lagging most peer nations.

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

So where's the good news? Science is figuring out ways to pump those numbers up again and pointing the way toward living more years — and more healthy years. And this doesn't require sci-fi, Silicon Valley anti-aging technology like blood swapping, or cellular reprogramming. According to Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and the author of the new book Super Agers, there are evidence-based steps you can take right now to help ensure you live a longer, healthier life.

“We're at a turning point,” Topol told me in an interview this week. “Thanks to advances in the science of aging, we can actually show everything is going in the right direction. We're making headway.”

It used to be that if you wanted to know how old you are, all you needed was a calendar. But your body's aging isn't as simple as turning the pages on a calendar: Depending on who you are and how you live, different parts of your body can age more quickly or slowly than. And it turns out this other kind of aging, biological aging, matters more for your health than the number of candles on your birthday cake.

In Super Agers, Topol points to a “metric revolution” in which blood-based proteomic clocks and DNA-methylation scores can pinpoint which organ system is aging the fastest, and by how many years. A 2024 Nature Medicine study used machine learning to examine more than 200 plasma proteins in thousands of people and showed that the resulting biological age forecasted 18 major diseases and all-cause mortality better than any single risk factor, like blood pressure or body mass.

“When you particularize risk to a person, the chance of them taking actions to mitigate it is much, much higher,” Topol said. 

It's one thing to know generally that as you get older, you need to be aware of the risks of heart disease or neurodegenerative diseases. It's another thing to be told that your brain age is, say, five years ahead of your calendar age — which means you need to intervene now to protect yourself.

What you can do: Companies are already offering biological age tests that you can order for your own use. Down the line, scientists at the University of Washington are developing a multi-organ biological clock that will be developed into a digital app.

There's no field where the prevailing advice seems more conflicting and confusing than in the science of nutrition. Atkins, South Beach, Paleo, Zone — you'd be forgiven for throwing up your hands and just ordering takeout from DoorDash.

But we do know what you eat is key to how well and how long you'll live, and the current American diet, heavy on ultra-processed foods and red meat, isn't cutting it. “Our diet is basically inviting disease instead of preventing it., Topol said.

A 30-year study looked at 105,000 adults and found that of the one in 10 study subjects who reached age 70 without cancer, cardiac disease, or serious cognitive decline, virtually all scored high on an eating index that closely tracks Mediterranean-style diets. That means plenty of whole grains, vegetables, olive oil, and omega-rich seafood. You should also try to cut out sugars and ultraprocessed foods as much as possible, and go very easy on red meat, which Topol notes can trigger aging-accelerating inflammation. 

What you can do: Start by something as simple as swapping out butter for olive oil and soda for sparkling water.

At this point, I think everyone knows just how important it is to get a good night's sleep. Poor sleep is associated with everything from heart disease to diabetes to dementia to obesity to cancer, not to mention a significantly increased risk of watching way too many Netflix shows.

But as Topol told me, it's not just how much sleep you're getting, but how you're sleeping. “The key thing is deep sleep,” he said. “If you don't get it, you're much more subject to brain aging and the three major diseases of aging.”

Research has shown that people who get fewer hours of deep sleep per night have a greater risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases like dementia, while a larger amount of deep sleep can act as a protection against Alzheimer's-related memory loss. 

What you can do: During the writing of Super Agers, Topol increased his own deep sleep from around 15 minutes per night to over an hour by adhering to a consistent sleep schedule and tracking his progress with wearables. And steer clear of drugs and supplements, which are unlikely to help you get the deep, restorative slumber you need.

As a cardiologist, Topol was long focused on aerobic exercise, which helps build up the cardiovascular system. But he now realizes that's not enough. “Aerobic was the thing,” he told me. “Now we know that strength and core training are equally important.”

One meta-analysis from 2022 found that just an hour of resistance training per week lowered all-cause mortality by as much as 25 percent. And beyond trying to reduce the chance of death, strength training when you're younger helps build up muscle mass, slowing down the inevitable decline of muscle that occurs as you age. 

What you can do: You don't have to start pumping iron like 1970s Arnold Schwarzenegger to get the anti-aging benefits of strength training. Bodyweight exercises will go a long way, as will resistance training that involves exercise bands. And as much as you may hate them, don't neglect those squats!

It may seem inevitable that as you age, your social circle and connections shrink. But it doesn't have to be that way — and there are enormous longevity benefits to keeping connected to the world and the people around you. “The strong data for social isolation shows it will compromise healthy aging,” Topol said.

A 2023 meta-analysis linked social isolation to a 32 percent higher risk of all-cause mortality, while self-reported loneliness specifically tacked on another 14 percent. Neuro-imaging studies have even shown a biological effect from being alone, demonstrating spikes in inflammatory cytokines and the shrinkage of hippocampal volume in the brain. 

What you can do: Get off your couch and out of your house, for one thing! Schedule regular face time with a friend, and ideally do it outside: Frequent time in nature has been associated with reduced epigenetic aging. 

There's plenty more in Super Agers, including Topol's optimism around GLP-1 inhibitors like Ozempic, which have been showing the ability to reduce the risk of diseases of aging like dementia. But you don't need cutting-edge medicines to live a longer, healthier life. You just need to change how you live your life.

The “American institution” of prepping, explained.

by  Hady Mawajdeh and  Noel King

If you're anything like me, following the news makes it feel like the world is on the verge of collapse. There are wars on multiple continents, millions are dying because of famine, extremism is on the rise, natural disasters caused by climate change have become the new norm, and the economy seems headed for a recession.And beyond all of those real-life concerns, there are apocalypses happening on just about every streaming service right now: HBO's The Last of Us deals with a deadly pandemic, a killer alien invasion is happening on Netflix's The Eternaut, and a volcanic eruption has caused a world-killing tsunami on Hulu's Paradise.So it's no wonder that a doomsday meal bucket is flying off the shelves at Costco or that some affluent Americans are paying out the wazoo for luxury doomsday bunkers. Even the ultra-wealthy are preparing for end times: Tesla founder Elon Musk hopes to colonize Mars to preserve our species, venture capitalist Peter Thiel secretly purchased loads of land in New Zealand to run away to in case of a disaster, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg built a top-secret compound in Hawaii — equipped with a bunker he calls an “underground storage” or “basement” — where he grows his own food and gathers his own water.Robert Kirsch, an assistant professor at Arizona State University and the co-author of Be Prepared: Doomsday Prepping in the United States, says prepping is as American as apple pie. “As Emily [Ray, my co-author] and I were digging into this, we eventually concluded that prepping is an American institution. And that from the founding [of the country], Americans have seen themselves as a prepared citizenry,” he said. “We've seen this throughout the past couple of hundreds of years, where Americans are invited to see themselves as the self-sufficient frontier people who are able to tame the elements and dominate the wilderness and bring America into new spaces.” 

Kirsch shared his insights into prepping and Americans' desire to look out for themselves in emergency situations with the Today, Explained co-host Noel King. You can read an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity, below, and listen to the full episode of Today, Explained on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts.

How does one get into, at the university level, researching the end of the world? 

It started off as this investigation into these doomsday-prepping kits that were coming out of Silicon Valley from this startup called Preppi.What was the story that Preppi was trying to tell?The way that they sold it, at least at the time that we were looking at their materials, was that this was a “bug-out bag” that you would be proud to display in your living room. It was a really nice weekend bag, and it had a piece of chocolate in there they say you're gonna really like. And had these very high-end cosmetics and face lotions. 

So this bag, its contents and style, don't mark you as some sort of weirdo who was sort of secretly stashing away goods, but rather it is sort of an outward display of good taste. And so, these class markers become super important in telling this story. Trying to sort of pull this behavior out of the shadows and sort of trying to locate it at the beating heart of mainstream American culture. 

Do you have a bug-out bag? 

I don't. Where I live in the desert, FEMA issues recommendations for geographic regions for what people should have. So my co-author, Emily Ray, does have a bug-out bag because she lives in the Bay Area. I have 15 gallons of potable water ready because I live in the desert. 

Good. I have a little kit, a just-in-case kit. And I have always wondered how many other people are engaged in prepping or prepping-adjacent behavior. How many of us are there out there? 

It can be hard to track. Because on the one hand, there's no bright line where a certain behavior turns into prepping, right? But FEMA does give a national household survey, and their 2023 results indicate that about half of Americans indicate that they are engaging in some kind of preparedness for some sort of adverse event. 

If you told me to envision a prepper, I have a picture in my head. Is my picture fair? Is there a type of person who preps? 

You're right that there's a sort of media spectacle version of a prepper, and that gets informed by a lot of things like cable and reality television. 

I'm not even just talking about the extreme preppers. There's an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, where they go into an Atlas bunker and try to imagine what it would be like to ride out the end of the world. And so I think that's an interesting starting point. But again, as Emily and I were digging into this, what we eventually concluded was that this behavior can be marginalized and seem to be extreme, but it actually is a kind of behavior that is constitutive of being American. 

In other words, we argue that prepping is an American institution, and that from the founding, Americans have seen themselves as a prepared citizenry. We've seen this throughout the past couple of hundreds of years, where Americans are invited to see themselves as the self-sufficient frontier people who are able to tame the elements and dominate the wilderness and bring America into new spaces. 

And that 40 percent of us are preparing in some way — this feels like a very high number to me — would seem to suggest you're right, this is part of the identity of many of us. When do we see this put to the test? 

There are a couple of ways to tackle that. The first is at the apocalyptic register, things like nuclear war, right? Or total societal collapse. Americans really haven't had to deal with that. And that's an important part for our analysis, too. Because we argue that one of the reasons what we call a “bunkerization fantasy” is potent is because Americans have never actually had to go to ground. They've never actually had to take cover in the way that many Europeans had to during the Second World War. 

That's one part of the story: It's easy to think about readiness and what to do in the face of total collapse because it's been deferred. It becomes a site of fantasy. On the other hand, you're also right that the US has ongoing extreme weather events, hurricanes, wildfires, dust bowls, droughts — the list goes on and on. And the way that we tell that story is the way we diagnosed the neoliberal condition of American political life: These disasters happen. There is an oftentimes inadequate or incomplete state response. And so the reaction to that becomes, I can't rely on the government to do things, so it's up to me to take responsibility for my own preparation. And the way that I do that is through consumption choices. 

Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.

One beautiful part of the American economy is that there is always somebody who will sell you something if you have enough money. And when we think about preppers, when I think about preppers, I do tend to think about ultra-rich people, like Mark Zuckerberg buying a private island, raising their own food, these guys in Silicon Valley buying land in New Zealand. 

What is the deal with the ultra-wealthy and their preparation for the end of the world? Do they know something that we don't or do they just have a lot of money and need to spend it? 

I think it's the latter. I really think this is a sort of conspicuous consumption. 

These ultra-rich people, we hear a lot about their preparation plans. You mentioned Zuckerberg and Peter Thiel, and those are the two most high-profile examples. And what I think is notable about those is that they get profiled in Forbes or Fortune or these monocle-like publications for upwardly mobile people. And they lavish the reader with all sorts of details about the extravagant things that these folks are doing. And then there's always this coy, But we'll never tell you where it is, right?

And so it's a way to signal conspicuous consumption that more middle-class or upwardly mobile Americans can at least try to emulate. But I do want to suggest, too, though, that this takes on strange dimensions. I'm sure, for instance, you've read a lot about Elon Musk's desire to go to Mars. 

So much. Yes.

Right, and it's a fantasy. It's in many ways based on this mentality, There's nothing we can do here anymore and so we're gonna have to try again on another orb. 

There's a risk here of upping the ante. So what starts with the rich often trickles down to the less rich, which is why I have a LifeStraw and an L.L. Bean knife. If we talk about people who are not the Elon Musks or the Peter Thiels of the world, is prepping big business among the middle class as well? 

Yes, and like many other industries in the US, it ebbs and flows. And we trace that back to the Cold War where there were home fallout shelter kits that you could buy. Those went under in the '60s and now they're coming back.

You can look at different kinds of preparedness markets that pop up. Shelf-stable food is becoming an increasingly common thing to see. I know at my local Costcos, there are often aisle endcaps that have pyramids of these food buckets that you can store in your house. We might just be in a period of upswing right now. There are still companies that will come bury a fallout shelter in your backyard and promise not to tell anybody where they put it.

You're in Arizona. What's the scenario that most worries you?

Grid failure. And that's just because, as you can imagine, in the Sonoran Desert, it's hard to imagine making it through 115-degree days without some kind of chemically induced air conditioning.

My biggest ones are electromagnetic pulse, hurricane, tornado, and civil war. Electromagnetic pulse is akin to grid failure, right? It means the electricity goes out, and you're trying to figure out what to do. We just saw this happen in Spain and Portugal. It was really a nightmare. It makes me wonder: Should we really want to survive a doomsday scenario? 

It sounds like a bleak question, but I think in some ways, that is the politically animating question. 

What can we confront alone and what can we confront together, right? And if we limit ourselves to confronting things alone, I think that threshold is pretty low. 

Yeah. 

And so you can think about, again, the ultimate example of this, thermonuclear conflagration. I would say, No, you don't wanna go through that. You'd want to just vaporize. But once you start thinking about smaller-scale or more regionally located catastrophes that might emerge, the tolerance for persisting through those things is amplified when they're done in concert and collectively with other people. When considering risk tolerance, that should be part of that narrative. 

For me, what makes me a cheerful apocalyptician is that the response to that is not, There's more I need to do. But rather, We need to form these sort of solidarity networks of concerted collective action to collectively face the problems that we face together.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy during a ""Coalition of the Willing"" news conference in Kyiv.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine was ready to meet for talks with Russia — but only after Vladimir Putin agrees to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, which the Russian president so far hasn't done.

Putin overnight proposed direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, but didn't address the ultimatum made on Saturday by Kyiv and its Western allies to either move forward with a temporary truce or face crippling new sanctions. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told Putin in a phone call on Sunday that Turkey was ready to host negotiations that would lead to “a permanent solution” to the war, according to a statement from his office.

Theoretically, the most effective hedge would be to short futures, but the challenge lies in knowing precisely when to lift it.

As April's volatility storm fades into memory, traders are left balancing calmer markets and the ever-present risk of a fresh round of headline shocks. 

A consensus had developed among derivatives strategists heading into 2025: While regular option selling by income ETFs and other funds would keep volatility broadly in check, there would be more short-term shocks like Aug. 5. Following the April 2 tariff selloff that sent the Cboe Volatility Index spiking before a reversal, that view looks prescient so far.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that trade talks with China officials in Geneva over the weekend were ""productive.""

He said the talks yielded ""a great deal"" of productivity and that he would give more details in a complete briefing on Monday morning.

Bessent also said that he and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer both spoke to President Donald Trump on Saturday evening and ""he is fully informed"" about the discussions.

Greer said during remarks on Sunday that the officials reached some form of a ""deal,"" but did not provide any specifics. He hailed the discussions as ""very constructive.""

""It's important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as maybe thought,"" Greer said.

""We're confident that the deal we struck with our Chinese partners will help us work toward resolving that national emergency,"" he added.

The high-stakes negotiations in Switzerland this weekend come amid widespread economic uncertainty stemming from the U.S.-China trade war.

The two nations have been engaged in a tariff tit-for-tat in the weeks since Trump announced 145% tariffs on Beijing. In response, China raised its levies on U.S. goods to 125%.

The standoff has roiled the financial markets and sparked concerns of fewer goods and rising prices for consumers.

Trump praised the first day of discussions, writing that the U.S. officials had a ""very good meeting today with China"" in a Saturday Truth Social post.

""Many things discussed, much agreed to. A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner,"" Trump wrote.

Bessent said that he and Greer met with the vice premier of China, in addition to two vice ministers, who the treasury secretary called ""integrally involved"" in discussions.

As struggling drugstore chains work to regain their footing, Walgreens is doubling down on automation. 

The company is expanding the number of retail stores served by its micro-fulfillment centers, which use robots to fill thousands of prescriptions for patients who take medications to manage or treat diabetes, high blood pressure and other conditions. 

Walgreens aims to free up time for pharmacy staff, reducing their routine tasks and eliminating inventory waste. Fewer prescription fills would allow employees to interact directly with patients and perform more clinical services such as vaccinations and testing.

Walgreens first rolled out the robot-powered centers in 2021, but paused expansion in 2023 to focus on gathering feedback and improving performance at existing sites. After more than a year of making upgrades, including new internal tools, the company said it is ready to expand the reach of that technology again.

Walgreens told CNBC it hopes to have its 11 micro-fulfillment centers serve more than 5,000 stores by the end of the year, up from 4,800 in February and 4,300 in October 2023. As of February, the centers handled 40% of the prescription volume on average at supported pharmacies, according to Walgreens. 

That translates to around 16 million prescriptions filled each month across the different sites, the company said. 

The renewed automation push comes as Walgreens prepares to go private in a roughly $10 billion deal with Sycamore Partners, expected to close by the end of the year. 

The deal would cap a turbulent chapter for Walgreens as a public company, marked by a rocky transition out of the pandemic, declining pharmacy reimbursement rates, weaker consumer spending and fierce competition from CVS Health, Amazon and other retail giants.

Like CVS, Walgreens has shifted from opening new stores to closing hundreds of underperforming locations to shore up profits. Both companies are racing to stay relevant as online retailers lure away customers and patients increasingly opt for fast home delivery over traditional pharmacy visits.

The changes also follow mounting discontent among pharmacy staff: In 2023, nationwide walkouts spotlighted burnout and chronic understaffing, forcing chains to reexamine their operational models.

Walgreens said the investment in robotic pharmacy fills is already paying off.

To date, micro-fulfillment centers have generated approximately $500 million in savings by cutting excess inventory and boosting efficiency, said Kayla Heffington, Walgreens' pharmacy operating model vice president. Heffington added that stores using the facilities are administering 40% more vaccines than those that aren't. 

""Right now, they're the backbone to really help us offset some of the workload in our stores, to obviously allow more time for our pharmacists and technicians to spend time with patients,"" said Rick Gates, Walgreens' chief pharmacy officer.

""It gives us a lot more flexibility to bring down costs, to increase the care and increase speed to therapy – all those things,"" he said. 

Gates added that the centers give Walgreens a competitive advantage because independent pharmacies and some rivals don't have centralized support for their stores. Still, Walmart, Albertsons and Kroger have similarly tested or are currently using their own micro-fulfillment facilities to dispense grocery items and other prescriptions. 

Micro-fulfillment centers come with their own risks, such as a heavy reliance on sophisticated robotics that can cause disruptions if errors occur. But the facilities are becoming a permanent fixture in retail due to the cost savings they offer and their ability to streamline workflows, reduce the burden on employees and deliver goods to customers faster.

When a Walgreens retail pharmacy receives a prescription, the system determines whether it should be filled at that location or routed to a nearby micro-fulfillment center. Maintenance medications, or prescription drugs taken regularly to manage chronic health conditions, and refills that don't require immediate pickup are often sent to micro-fulfillment.

At the core of each facility is a highly automated system that uses robotics, conveyor belts and barcode scanners, among other tools, to fill prescriptions. The operations are supported by a team of pharmacists pharmacy technicians and other professionals.

Instead of staff members filling prescriptions by hand at stores, pill bottles move through an automated and carefully choreographed assembly line. 

Pharmacy technicians fill canisters with medications for robot pods to dispense, and pharmacists verify those canisters to make sure they are accurate. Yellow robotic arms grab a labeled prescription vial and hold it up to a canister, which precisely dispenses the specific medication for that bottle.

Certain prescriptions are filled at separate manual stations, including inhalers and birth control pill packs. Each prescription is then sorted and packaged for delivery back to retail pharmacy locations for final pickup.

There are other security and safety measures throughout the process, said Ahlam Antar, registered group supervisor of a micro-fulfillment center in Mansfield, Massachusetts. 

For example, the robot pods automatically lock and signal an error with a red-orange light if a worker attaches a canister to the wrong dispenser, preventing the incorrect pills from going in a prescription, she said. 

Properly training workers at the centers to ensure accuracy and patient safety is also crucial, according to Sarah Gonsalves, a senior certified pharmacy technician at the Mansfield site. 

She said a core part of her role is to make sure that technicians can correctly perform the different tasks in the process. 

Antar, who has worked at the Mansfield site since its 2022 opening, said Walgreens has made improvements to the micro-fulfillment process after considering feedback from stores and patients during the paused expansion. That includes establishing new roles needed to support the process at the sites, such as a training manager for all 11 locations. 

The facilities also plan to transition to using smaller prescription vials after hearing concerns that the current bottles are too large, according to a Walgreens spokesperson. They said that will allow the centers to ship more prescriptions per order and reduce costs.

Heffington said the automated locations have helped reduce Walgreens' overall prescription fulfillment costs by nearly 13% compared to a year ago. 

She said Walgreens has also increased prescription volume by 126% year-over-year, now filling more than 170 million prescriptions annually. The company hopes to raise that number to 180 million or even more. 

Heffington added that Walgreens implemented new internal tools to track the work across all 11 centers and provide real-time data on where a patient's prescription is in the micro-fulfillment process. 

""If a patient called the store and said, 'Hey, can you tell me where my prescription is today?' [Workers] can do that with great specificity,"" thanks to the new tools, Heffington said. 

Despite the company's progress, Gates said there is more work to be done with micro-fulfillment centers. 

For example, he pointed to the possibility of shipping prescriptions directly to patients' doorsteps instead of putting that burden on retail stores. 

""It's only step one right now,"" he said. 

Other improvements may still be needed at facilities, according to some reports. For example, WRAL News reported in April that some customers at a Walgreens store in Garner, North Carolina, say they are only getting partial prescription fills, with several pills missing, or their medicine is being delayed.

Before Brian Gange's Arizona store started relying on an automated facility, he walked into the pharmacy every morning knowing that a massive list of prescriptions was in his work queue waiting to be filled for the day. 

Now, with help from micro-fulfillment, that list is significantly smaller each day, according to Gange. 

""We don't have to spend as much time on just those repetitive fulfillment tasks,"" he told CNBC. ""It really takes a huge weight off our shoulders."" 

Gange said that gives him and his team time to step behind the pharmacy counter and interact with customers face-to-face, answering questions, providing advice, performing health tests or administering vaccines. 

That kind of attention can make all the difference for a patient.  

For example, Gange recalls stepping away for five minutes to take a patient's blood pressure despite being overwhelmed with tasks while working at a different Walgreens location several years ago. He ended up sending that person to the emergency room because their blood pressure was ""off the charts."" 

That patient's wife visited the pharmacy the next day to thank Gange, saying her husband ""probably wouldn't be here with us today"" without that blood pressure test. 

""I shouldn't have to question whether I have that five or 10 minutes to check a blood pressure for a patient,"" Gange said. ""Micro-fulfillment and centralized services are really what are going to allow us to be able to do that, to have that time."" 

""That really allows us to provide better care for them,"" he added.

Media companies are staring down widespread economic uncertainty as their annual pitch to advertisers and marketers kicks off.

This week legacy entertainment giants including Comcast's NBCUniversal, Fox Corp. and Warner Bros. Discovery will stage presentations to ad buyers about why they should commit money to their upcoming slates of sports, entertainment and news programming. Netflix and Amazon's Prime Video are crowding the field holding their second annual Upfronts. Paramount Global held its presentations with advertisers and agencies last week.

This year the stakes are high as chief marketing officers across brands formulate contingency plans for a variety of outcomes regarding tariffs, inflation, consumer sentiment and other macroeconomic shifts that could affect their spending.

The evolving cost landscape adds to the existing headwinds facing the media industry: Pay-TV subscribers are fleeing for streaming options. And while streaming has begun to reach profitability for some companies, the services have yet to prove as lucrative as the traditional bundle. Meanwhile competition is stiff as digital and social media players capture the lion's share of ad dollars.

It'll prove another year of Upfronts clouded by concerns following the Covid pandemic and Hollywood strikes. Last year showed stabilization in an ad market, and executives had earlier told CNBC 2025 was expected to be another year of normalization.

Instead, the industry is bracing itself — and executives are fine-tuning their pitch for the moment.

""Media becomes more complicated in the landscape that's defined by inflation, regulatory uncertainty, shifting go-to-market timelines, and that serves as this backdrop for the season,"" said John Halley, ad sales chief at Paramount. ""In moments of uncertainty like this there are very few places that offer the reach, the brand safety and the impact of the Paramount portfolio. That's an important point to make in a market like this.""

In interviews with the top ad chiefs among the legacy media companies, executives touted sure-fire content and reliable viewership metrics in an effort to demonstrate the importance of advertising during uncertain times. Many executives said they have yet to see a ""material"" pullback on ad spending, as had been feared.

Chief among the top categories during Upfronts is live sports, they said. Live events, like awards shows, and so-called ""must-see TV"" will also be a big factor in conversations.

""Sports is having a halo on live [TV] in general,"" said Gina Reduto, executive vice president of ad strategy at NBCUniversal.

Although general entertainment has fallen behind sports in ratings, shows like Warner Bros. Discovery's ""The White Lotus,"" which generated steady viewership and controlled the cultural conversation on a weekly basis, stand out.

""I think everyone knows that regardless of what happens, they still have to sell, they still have to move [product],"" said Rita Ferro, Disney's president of global advertising. ""They say, 'We still have to deliver products and services to our customers, and we have to do that in the best ways possible.' That's understanding the parameters we're dealing with and what those implications are in terms of pricing.""

Concerns that President Donald Trump's trade war could jack up prices have yet to translate into a pullback in advertising spending, media executives told CNBC. Quarterly reports for media companies have yet to reflect any decrease in spend due to tariffs, although the decline of the linear TV bundle has weighed down financials.

WBD has yet to see ""any material cuts"" to its advertising volume, said Ryan Gould and Bobby Voltaggio, the company's presidents of U.S. advertising sales.

""The sentiment in the market isn't really indicative of what we're seeing currently. But you know, obviously, the future state of impact is yet to be known,"" said Voltaggio.

Jeff Collins, Fox's president of ad sales, echoed his peers: ""Every client that we're talking with obviously has their scenario planning down for different things that could happen. But I think one of the important lessons that they learned during Covid was not to overreact to uncertainty.

""Obviously you need to have a plan, and they all have plans,"" Collins said. ""But until there's some sort of tangible impact to their business, we haven't seen anyone really looking to pullback.""

Disney's Ferro said her team has spent additional time with advertising partners in recent months, discussing various scenarios in which tariffs could affect different categories and products. She added chief marketing officers she's spoken with are operating in what she called ""war rooms.""

Ferro recounted specific conversations with a mobile phone company (which she declined to identify) that highlight the trade policy volatility: The phone company on a Friday in mid-April decided to pull an order for roughly $1.5 million in advertising for the month in light of tariff exposure. That weekend, the Trump administration exempted smartphones and other devices from the tariff scheme.

""So on Monday, that deal that went away on Friday went to order,"" said Ferro.

""It's literally in real time what's happening. I think there's a lot of scenarios they're going through and it's very in real time,"" Ferro said.

Data firm eMarketer estimated traditional TV advertising spending during Upfronts will decline by between $2.78 billion and $4.12 billion, depending on the severity of the tariff impact. Spending on streaming in these annual discussions will be more stable, however, with eMarketer expecting $1 billion in growth in that category. Media companies sell advertising for both platforms together.

This gives advertisers the upper hand when negotiating pricing, with the exception of sports content. It's likely the companies that are more affected by the loss of pay-TV subscribers will be willing to lower their pricing, said Jonathan Gudai, CEO of Adomni, a digital advertising platform.

Ad data firm EDO said there has already been a pullback on estimated ad spending in the automotive and various retail and consumer sectors since Trump's announcement on tariffs.

At the same time, concerns from consumers on soon-to-be higher prices has translated to higher ad effectiveness. For example, home appliances brands cut estimated spending by 30%, but consumers' responsiveness to ads rose 77%.

Media executives — who largely declined to discuss pricing — all said data from firms like EDO is key in discussions with advertisers, which are increasingly looked for tailored, targeted buys rather than sheer audience size.

""Advertisers are saying, 'I want to buy very specific audiences.' That's why outcomes are so important,"" said Kevin Krim, CEO of EDO. ""You've got to have a very granular view of what you're willing to pay for.""

All of these factors play into a recurring question for the advertising market: Do the annual Upfronts still matter?

""I've been in the business for about 30 years and the question of do we still need the Upfront [presentations] comes up every single year,"" said Fox's Collins.

The answer this year for the traditional media giants may be: more than ever.

""That's the last moment that you want to quit advertising because, you know, you got to try harder, not sort of capitulate,"" said EDO's Krim.

Krim added the need for flexibility makes real-time data more important: ""You cannot be using last year's model.""

He also said it may further shift ad dollars to programmatic buying, putting media companies on a more ""level playing field"" with digital companies like Meta, Amazon and Google. Despite being behemoths in the ad space, these tech companies have started to reveal the beginnings of cracks in their ad businesses.

The annual presentations could also lock in buying for some of the consistent favorite categories.

NBCUniversal's Reduto told CNBC that locking in ads during the Upfronts gives ""an opportunity for advertisers to guarantee they have access to the things they know truly drives sales.""

Earlier this year, Mark Marshall, NBCUniversal's chairman of global advertising and partnerships said in a letter that mapped out the company's upcoming slate of big sports events, including the Super Bowl, Olympics and World Cup, as proof of Upfronts' utility.

""I think from an advertiser perspective they still value the ability to lock in the franchise positions that they want to own, lock them in at desirable pricing, and be afforded flexibility,"" said Collins.

Disney's announcement last week that its newest theme park will be in Abu Dhabi offers further confirmation of the status of the United Arab Emirates as a global consumer crossroads located in the Middle East. At the center of the UAE's economic engine is man-made Yas Island, located 20 minutes from the center of Abu Dhabi and which first began development in 2006 for the Formula 1 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Since that 2009 debut for F1 in the region, Ferrari World, Yas Waterworld, Warner Bros. World, and SeaWorld Yas Island have followed. By 2024, Yas Island's traffic hit 38 million visitors.   

""The UAE in many respects is the crossroads of the world,"" Iger said of Disney's decision. ""About 500 million people that are income qualified, meaning they can afford to visit one of our parks, live within a four-hour plane trip here."" 

The UAE is the second-largest economy in the Arab world, after Saudi Arabia, and the more diversified market-based economy. Since the mid-2000s, Abu Dhabi has been actively pursuing new economic opportunities, with major efforts accelerating in the 2006–2008 period under its strategic Economic Vision 2030 plan, when Yas Island development began. A 6-8 hour flight from 80% of the world's population — and boasting the largest global airline hub in the world, clocking 120 million passengers each year — the strategic geography, massive investment, and major consumer attractions situate Yas Island to continue to expand its status as a global consumer epicenter. 

""Abu Dhabi continues to be a destination of choice for the world,"" said Mohamed Khalifa Al Mubarak, chairman of the Department of Culture and Tourism Abu Dhabi, and Chairman of Miral — the developer of Yas Island, which will fully develop and build the park working with Disney Imagineers.

Historically, Dubai has led the way in diversifying away from reliance on oil, but Dubai has always been more dependent on non-oil revenue to drive its economy. Its crude reserves pale in comparison to Abu Dhabi, with just 1% of its GDP coming from oil. By comparison, Abu Dhabi holds 90% of the UAE oil reserves, and draws 60% of its GDP from petroleum. Included in the UAE economic plan is a target of reducing oil revenue to less than 40% of its GDP.  

The consumer economy is a key part of the plan, but the UAE's future is far from centered only on creating more tourist attractions. Karen Young, senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, said the center of Abu Dhabi's economic significance remains finance. 

""Abu Dhabi is a finance capital, led by its multiple sovereign investment vehicles,"" she said. The Disney park is another display of that economic power. ""Its power comes from its ability to deploy capital, not attract tourism,"" Young said. 

Disney will not be investing capital in the project, although it does have current plans to invest $60 billion in other theme parks around the world.

The UAE's investment strength isn't just on display at home, but expanding to many U.S. projects as well, including recent deals to power AI infrastructure within the country.

""The theme park is a nice addition to other attractions in Yas island, and is an effort to bring quality of life amenities to residents and tourists,"" Young said. But she added, ""Dubai's economy is much more dependent on tourism.""

As a result of its greater need, Dubai's success with consumer attractions has been more uneven than Abu Dhabi's, according to experts, which deliberately chose a slower growth model given its significant oil reserves — it gave a financial lifeline to Dubai following the 2008 financial crisis. But the move toward a more diversified economy is showing signs of major acceleration with the Disney deal. 

Overall, the UAE ""is absolutely in a growth mode,"" said Dennis Speigel, Founder & CEO of International Theme Park Services, an industry consultant. Abu Dhabi and Yas Island have built on demand at a proper pace, he says, developing a critical mass of leisure entertainment. While Dubai, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar have all been trying to attract Disney going back as far as a decade, Speigel said Yas Island is the right location for a Disney theme park in what he referred to as the final frontier for leisure development.

Disney isn't saying when the park will open, with executives only pointing to general theme park construction timelines, which can take up to five years from design to development and buildout. As construction of the Disney park proceeds, it may face questions about worker conditions, which have long been an issue of controversy in the region's development boom. But for now, Speigel says, ""bringing the Disney organization's commitment to Abu Dhabi and Yas Island demonstrates that this area within the UAE has reached the pinnacle of entertainment.""

In this article

The U.S. Federal Reserve recently announced its plan to keep interest rates steady, cautioning, ""uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further."" It noted that the risk of higher unemployment and elevated inflation have risen. Indeed, tariff wars have shaken global markets and knocked investor sentiment.

Nonetheless, investors looking for attractive picks amid the ongoing volatility can track the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts, who have the expertise to select stocks with the potential to thrive despite short-term challenges.

With that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

We start this week with Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms (META), which surpassed analysts' estimates for the first quarter of 2025, reflecting resilience in a tough macroeconomic backdrop. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Meta is well-positioned to navigate any ongoing challenges.

In reaction to the strong Q1 print, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth reiterated a buy rating on META stock and boosted the 12-month price target to $675 from $610, saying that Meta remains his firm's top pick. Noting the company's Q1 beat and Q2 outlook, Anmuth said he believed the company's artificial intelligence (AI) ad enhancements, such as Andromeda and GEM, are having a significant impact on its ability to make money from the technology. 

On the rise in Meta Platforms' full-year capital expenditure guidance, the analyst said that he is OK with the increase, given that the company is delivering good results and tracking well on its AI roadmap. He added that Meta has a track record of generating returns on increased spending.  

Anmuth said that AI is fueling huge early gains in Meta's advertising and engagement, with the analyst expecting notable progress soon in business messaging/agents and Meta AI.

""We continue to believe that Meta is well positioned for a tougher macro environment given its scaled advertiser base, highly performant platform and vertical agnostic inventory,"" Anmuth said.

Anmuth ranks No. 49 among more than 9,500 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 20.1%. See Meta Platforms Options Activity on TipRanks.

Anmuth is also bullish on e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (AMZN). Following the company's Q1 results, the analyst reaffirmed a buy rating on AMZN and raised the price target to $225 from $220. Amazon reported better-than-expected Q1 2025 results but issued soft guidance for the second quarter, citing tariff woes.

The analyst noted that the company's Q1 revenue and operating income exceeded the higher end of prior guidance, while the second-quarter outlook reflected lower-than-feared macro and tariff-related impacts.

Though Microsoft's Azure outperformed Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the March quarter and AWS is currently capacity-constrained, the analyst continues to believe that growth can move higher in the second half of the year as more supply comes online. He added that Amazon is not witnessing any visible change in demand.

Anmuth noted that the sequential deceleration in AWS revenue growth to 17% in Q1 2025 from 19% in the fourth quarter was offset by solid profitability. Notably, AWS' operating margin touched an all-time high of 39.5% in the first quarter.  

The analyst said that while Amazon did not discuss all its mitigation efforts related to suppliers and geographic sourcing of products, it has taken measures to pull forward inventory because of the tariff wars.

""Importantly, AMZN remains focused on broad selection, low pricing and fast delivery, and believes it typically emerges from uncertain macro periods with greater relative market share gains,"" said Anmuth. See Amazon Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.

Finally, let's look at Roku (ROKU), a maker of streaming devices and other products, and a distributor of streaming services. While Roku delivered a modest revenue beat and reported a narrower-than-anticipated loss per share for the first quarter, shares declined as the company trimmed its full-year revenue outlook and issued lower-than-expected Q2 revenue guidance.

Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese highlighted that while Roku lowered its 2025 revenue outlook, it maintained Platform revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance, crediting enhanced profit from its initiatives and anticipated revenue from acquiring Frndly TV. Roku last week agreed to buy Frndly TV, an affordable subscription streaming service that offers live TV, on-demand video, and cloud-based DVR (Digital Video Recorder), for $185 million in cash in a deal espected to close in the second quarter.

Despite the impact of macroeconomic challenges, Reese believes that Roku is well-positioned within the relatively safe connected TV industry owing to increasing diversification of platform revenue. The analyst also highlighted that a more diversified business model is helping Roku deliver consistent results.

Reese thinks that investors will appreciate Roku for its balanced approach as it grows internationally, improves its platform and enhances The Roku Channel's ad capabilities, while focusing on expense discipline to drive free cash flow.

""We expect Roku to benefit from its DSP (demand-side platform) partnerships, high-quality inventory, improved targeting sports-adjacent ads, and various price points across its platform to meet advertisers' needs,"" said Reese, reiterating a buy rating on ROKU stock with a price target of $100.  

Reese ranks No. 830 among more than 9,500 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Her ratings have been profitable 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.5%. See Roku Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

The Social Security Administration is under new leadership, after financial services executive Frank Bisignano was sworn in as commissioner this week.

Bisignano's confirmation follows a host of changes at the federal agency during the first 100 days of the Trump administration, many of them through the Department of Government Efficiency.

For the approximate 73 million beneficiaries who rely on monthly Social Security checks, those changes may affect how they receive services from the agency.

From benefit increases for certain pensioners to changing policies on benefit withholdings and customer service, here are some of the biggest shifts of which beneficiaries should take note.

A new law that went into effect in January will provide almost 3 million individuals with increased Social Security benefits.

The Social Security Fairness Act provides higher monthly Social Security checks for individuals who also receive pensions from work that did not include payment of Social Security payroll taxes. It will also provide lump sum retroactive payments starting from January 2024.

Monthly benefit increases may range from ""very little"" to ""over $1,000 more each month,"" according to the Social Security Administration, which began those adjustments in February.

The change affects certain workers such as teachers, firefighters and police officers; federal employees under the Civil Service Retirement System; and people who work under foreign social security programs, according to the agency. Those workers had previously seen their benefits reduced or eliminated due to the Windfall Elimination Provision and Government Pension Offset, which have been nixed with the new law.

More from Personal Finance:Social Security reduces benefit clawback rateTrump administration restarts student loan collectionsWhat experts say about claiming Social Security benefits early

In the first 100 days of the Trump administration, SSA has paid more than $14.8 billion in retroactive payments to more than 2.2 million individuals, according to the agency.

The agency has expedited the processing of the benefit changes under President Donald Trump. However, it may take a year or more to issue payments for some cases that cannot be processed through automation, according to the agency.

Social Security beneficiaries are sometimes overpaid benefits due to errors.

When that happens, the Social Security Administration requires the extra money to be repaid to the agency.

Because it can take months or years to catch on to those mistakes, beneficiaries can be on the hook to repay big sums. That money may be withheld from benefit checks until the overpayment has been repaid.

The Social Security Administration has made various adjustments to the default withholding rate from benefits.

In response to complaints that a 100% default withholding rate caused financial hardship for affected beneficiaries, the agency under President Joe Biden changed that default withholding rate to 10% of a beneficiary's monthly benefit or $10, whichever was greater.

Under Trump, SSA has had a tougher stance on overpayments. In March, the agency announced it planned to reinstate the default withholding rate to 100% of an individual's monthly benefit. The change was estimated to generate about $7 billion in overpayment recoveries in the next decade.

However, the agency recently issued an emergency message notifying its employees that new overpayment notices sent on or after April 25 will have a 50% default withholding rate. That applies to retirement, survivors and disability insurance benefits. The withholding rate for Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, benefits is still 10%.

Some experts worry a 50% default withholding rate is still too high.

""Losing 50% [of benefits] for a lot of people could put them into immediate economic hardship,"" Richard Fiesta, executive director of the Alliance for Retired Americans, recently told CNBC.com.

Overpayment of Social Security is not the only reason benefits may be withheld.

On May 5, the government resumed collections efforts on federal student loans in default. Now, the Education Department may use the Treasury Department Offset Program to withhold benefits for defaulted loans, as well as other payments like tax refunds and salaries. Some of those garnishments could start as soon as June, according to the Education Department.

The Social Security Administration may also withhold current and future Social Security checks for child support, alimony or restitution payments, according to the agency.

The IRS may take a portion of Social Security payments until it recoups the full balance of overdue federal tax debts.

Individuals who call SSA's 800 phone number face long hold times before they speak to someone at the agency.

To make an in-person appointment, they must either call that number or visit the website, which has experienced glitches.

Those difficulties are ""neither new nor unique to the current administration,"" Republican House Ways and Means Committee members recently wrote to Bisignano. Meanwhile, Democrats worry those difficulties could signal bigger problems ahead.

In a bid to reduce wait times, the agency has encouraged individuals to use its web site when possible.

The agency is in the process of modernizing its telecommunications platform, which is expected to allow it to better manage calls and provide more self-service options. The rollout, which is expected to be completed by the end of this summer, has helped improve answer rates and average speed of answer, based on early results, according to the Social Security Administration.

As Bisignano takes the helm, advocacy groups are urging for the agency to make the needs of its beneficiaries a priority.

""The vast majority of his current customer base cannot transact financial business through anything other than face to face contact in an office or on the telephone, and they have to be prepared to accommodate that,"" said Maria Freese, senior legislative representative at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.

The Trump administration tasked the Department of Government Efficiency with curbing ""waste, fraud and abuse"" at federal agencies.

Under DOGE, the Social Security Administration sought to make it so services that could previously be handled over the phone would need to be done in person at an agency office to prevent fraud.

However, the agency has since scaled back that policy to allow for claims for retirement, survivor and spousal and children's benefits to still be permitted over the phone. Individuals making other claims, including Social Security disability insurance, Medicare and Supplemental Security Income, can also still use the agency's 800 number.

Notably, changes to direct deposit information will mostly still need to be handled either online or in person.

Consequently, almost 2 million more elderly and disabled individuals may need to visit Social Security offices in person annually, the Social Security Administration has revealed.

The online process may be difficult for some individuals because it requires multi-factor, multi-step online verification and a one-time PIN code, CBPP notes. Previous estimates have found that about 42% of older adults may lack access to reliable broadband service, according to the AARP.

In some cases, people may be able to change their direct deposit information over the phone if they are also able to verify their identity online, according to Freese.

The agency has ""left this very convoluted system in place to use the telephone in order to change your banking information, but for the vast majority of seniors and members of the disability community, they're never going to be able to use it,"" Freese said.

Direct deposit fraud represents less than one-hundredth of one percent of benefits that are misdirected, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

The Social Security Administration plans to roll out a new secure digital form of identification as an alternative to traditional paper cards beginning early this summer.

The new digital feature will allow individuals who have either forgotten their Social Security number or who have lost their Social Security cards to access their personal number online through the agency's My Social Security website.

They will also be able to access their Social Security numbers through digital devices and display them as identification for ""reasons other than handling Social Security matters,"" according to the agency.

With the new effort, the agency aims to reduce the inconveniences caused by lost or stolen cards, which currently requires individuals to apply for replacements either online or in person.

They crypto bull move continued into the weekend thanks to a trio of positive macro developments.

Likely most responsible for the move was a President Trump Truth Social post regarding trade talks being held in Switzerland between the U.S. and China.

""A very good meeting today,"" said Trump. ""Many things discussed, much agreed to,"" he continued. ""A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner. We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!""

Earlier Saturday, Trump also announced a ""full and immediate"" ceasefire in the brewing war between India and Pakistan.

Completing the trio of good news, Russian President Putin said he was ""in the mood for serious talks with Ukraine,"" and suggested talks ""without preconditions"" in Turkey next week.

Bitcoin (BTC) rose to just a few dollars short of $105,000 before pulling back to the current $104,500, ahead 1.5% over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH) has continued its recent outperformance, up 7.7% over the same time frame.

Cryptocurrency has become an increasingly popular form of investing, in large part thanks to the prevalence of Bitcoin — which yet again traded above the $100,000 price point on May 8.

Ever since programmer Laszlo Hanyecz spent 10,000 BTC on two pizzas back in 2010, marking the first real-world transaction using Bitcoin, investors have pushed the limits of what they can — and cannot — do with the cryptocurrency.

One particular investor, Grant Cardone, recently shared in an episode of “Opening Bid” that he's using Bitcoin to buy real estate. Here's how he's doing it, and what industry experts have to say on the matter.

While some investors argue the merits of investing in real estate, Bitcoin or stocks, Grant Cardone had another idea: Why not put all three together?

“What if the real estate bought my Bitcoin, and then I could actually take the whole thing public?” he surmised.

What he did then was purchase an $88 million piece of real estate for $72 million as a correction (because of the current state of the debt market). He then added $15 million worth of Bitcoin to the transaction and put the two values — $72 million and $15 million — together in a separate fund.

Then, he gave his audience the chance to take part of that Bitcoin-real estate fund, which they did. Since neither the property itself nor the Bitcoin has debt on it, the monthly cash flow is around $350,000. Cardone then uses that money to purchase more Bitcoin.

The end result?

Cardone will still own the real estate in, say, four years. Assuming the value of that property stays valued at $88 million, his overall investment will increase thanks to the combination of purchasing Bitcoin at today's prices and real estate.

“So, what's better than real estate or Bitcoin?” he asked. “What's better is if I could get Bitcoin out of my real estate and then take the two things…and bring it to the public markets at the end of this year or the first of next year and we're gonna go ring the bell and turn it into a piece of paper.”

As of now, Cardone has done this process four times with the intent of doing ten in total.

So, should you use Bitcoin to invest in real estate? It depends on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

“Long-term holders sitting on significant gains may want to convert a portion of Bitcoin to real estate as a way to diversify,” said Ian Kane, CEO and Founder at Firepan. “They get peace of mind and don't run the risk of seeing 6- or 7-figure portfolio swings. Plus, real estate offers passive income opportunities and can be a hedge against crypto's volatility. However, if Bitcoin's price pumps shortly after the purchase, you may have buyer's remorse.”

An alternative that can still pad your investment portfolio is to get a BItcoin-backed mortgage.

“The loan is secured by the real-estate + BTC, and you can make your monthly mortgage payments as a percentage of your BTC, denominated in USD,” said Kane. “This is the best of both worlds!”

But know that Bitcoin has its challenges, particularly when it comes to stability and regulation. Its value has skyrocketed, but it's still a volatile asset. For some, investing with crypto could also make it harder to make effective real estate deals — though this could change with time.

“While it's an interesting concept, I don't believe buying real estate with Bitcoin is practical in most cases — at least not yet,” said Louis Adler, Co-Founder, Principal and Real Estate Broker at REAL New York. “Real estate is still a fundamentally traditional asset class, and the volatility of crypto creates too many unknowns for both buyers and sellers.”

Key Points

Bitcoin (BTC 0.50%) is up about 25% in the last 30 days alone. It's more likely than not to continue rising, and there's one huge and undeniable reason that makes that the case.

So, without further ado, here's why the rest of 2025 is probably going to be a great time for holders.

We all look at the performance of our investments. The brokerage websites and applications make it easy to see exactly how your favorite stock or cryptocurrency is performing relative to your cost basis. Total gains are denoted in green, and losses in red.

The temptation to sell one of your holdings is much higher when your total return is negative. Conversely, it's fairly easy to continue retaining an investment when it's obvious that your (genius) investment thesis is playing out, as shown by a healthy gain. If you're like most people, you probably take a look at the price chart of your investments from time to time, whether you're holding them at a loss or a gain. Upward-climbing charts are, at least psychologically, proof that your gains will continue to grow, whereas tumbling lines on the chart are sufficient to cement your dread that your losses will deepen, prompting you to sell.

Putting aside the invalidity of short-term price-based reasoning about whether to buy, hold, or sell an asset, it's undeniable that investors are an emotional bunch that tend not to be able to maintain a long-term mindset about their holdings when faced with the anxiety of experiencing losses. At the same time, when most of the investors who hold an asset are holding it at a gain rather than a loss, incredible things can happen -- and that's exactly what's happening with Bitcoin right now.

As of May 5, according to data from Glassnode, a cryptocurrency data provider, at the price of $95,000 per coin, about 88% of all Bitcoin wallets were holding Bitcoin at a gain rather than a loss. And that's the huge reason why it's likely to keep climbing.

The price of the coin is currently more than $103,000. The overwhelming majority of Bitcoin's holders are not under any emotional pressure to cut their losses whatsoever. That means they are far more likely to continue holding and adding to their positions than they are to sell.

That is going to continue driving the coin's price even higher in the short term, even before taking any of the other powerful drivers for its value into account.

It is very unlikely that the price of Bitcoin will trend upward forever solely on the basis of most holders having an unrealized profit this month. There will probably be some macroeconomic events that are able to crack the market's bullish sentiment, causing some investors to sell. In other words, Bitcoin is destined to experience a crash or a sharp fall at some point in the future, and it is very likely that the decline will be so sharp that many investors sell their holdings at a loss and swear off cryptocurrencies altogether.

That doesn't detract from the long-term thesis for buying and holding Bitcoin, but it's a fact of life that assets go through cycles of being heavily favored and disfavored.

The way to deal with this reality is to have a plan for investing during both the asset's good times and also its hard times. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) with small amounts of capital when the market is practically euphoric about Bitcoin, like now, is a way to make sure you won't get wiped out to the point of feeling bad if there's a decline. At the same time, keeping some of your capital in reserve to buy the dips in the coin's price is also a good idea because doing so will enable you to capture upside when other investors are panicking.

The core pillar of this two-handed strategy is to hold your coins for the long term, which in this case means at least four years or so, but preferably closer to 40 years or so. The longer you can diligently accumulate Bitcoin, the more gain you will get from its inherent and ever-escalating scarcity, as well as medium-term drivers like institutional and sovereign adoption. Detach your investing habits from your emotions, and it won't matter how many other investors are holding Bitcoin at a gain or a loss -- you will be taking advantage of its value-generating capabilities all the while, regardless.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Analyst Tips Ethereum To Rival Bitcoin In The Long Run","https://bitcoinist.com/analyst-tips-ethereum-rival-bitcoin-in-the-long-run/","Sun, 11 May 2025 14:00:26 GMT","

Crypto market pundit Nick Tomaino has shared an interesting take on Ethereum's potential to match up with Bitcoin as the most valuable cryptocurrency. The web3 commentator and founder of prominent investment firm 1confirmation has elucidated on Ethereum's features, providing a compelling case on why the altcoin could soon match up to Bitcoin's social and market status.


According to Tomaino in an X post on May 10, Bitcoin can be described as the first decentralized currency or store of value created for the people by the people. The analyst explains that the asset's ascent to a $2 trillion value was based on this premise emanating from “grassroots ethos and belief” among users. 

However, Tomaino believes there is an ongoing shift in Bitcoin's neutrality and decentralization due to the influx of institutional investors in recent years. The 1confirmation founder said: 

Store of value based on trust in math rather than trust in people is world-changing, but BTC is now the institutional asset of choice for large companies and governments. One entity owns over 2.5% of it.

Tomaino also criticized Bitcoin's limitations in smart contract programmability, thereby limiting the amount of useful applications it can offer the populace. 

On the other hand, the crypto analyst has described Ethereum as a credibly neutral cryptocurrency and store of value with no growing concentration in the hands of select investors. Tomaino also applauds Ethereum's extensive blockchain utility as a developer platform facilitating other applications, including stablecoins, decentralized finance, prediction markets, and NFTs, among others. 

According to the 1confirmation founder, all the new crypto use cases that have contributed massively to the space's growth in the past ten years are based on the Ethereum blockchain.

Tomaino backs the continuous growth of these use cases, which he believes will drive billions to the crypto space, increasing ETH's scarcity and strengthening its case as a store of value to rival Bitcoin's dominance and market attraction. 

Nick Tomaino added:

Maximalists say there will be only one credibly neutral, internet native store of value. They are dead wrong. 

There will be many but there are only 2 viable options today: BTC and ETH

At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,545 following an 8.68% gain in the past day. Over the last month, the altcoin has grown by 64.19%, indicating a decisive market capture by the ETH bulls.

Interestingly, OKX Partner and popular crypto pundit Ted Pillows has backed ETH to maintain this uptrend, which has come following an upswing from $1,400. Pillows is predicting ETH to maintain an upward trajectory with a price target of $4,000 by Q3 2025.

 Ethereum's bullish fractals, emerging altseason signals, and strength over SOL, XRP fuel $10,000 ETH price target speculation. 

Key takeaways:

Ether has rebounded from key parabolic and triangle support levels, reviving the case for a $10,000 breakout.

Historical fractals and RSI recovery mirror past pre-rally setups seen in 2016 and 2020.

Altseason signals and strength against rivals like SOL and XRP boost Ethereum's potential to outperform.

Ether (ETH), Ethereum's native token, has soared over 44% in just three days to surpass $2,600 on May 11, fueling fresh speculation of a run toward $10,000 in the coming months. 

A mix of fractal setups as well as Ether's potential to outperform its top-ranking rivals, Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP (XRP), are serving as some catalysts behind the five-figure price prediction.

Ether's long-term price action continues to follow a parabolic curve that has defined its major market cycles since 2015. 

As of May 2025, ETH has rebounded from the curve's lower boundary near $2,100 — a historically significant support zone that has previously triggered major rallies. 

If this parabolic trajectory holds, Ethereum's next move could be toward the upper boundary of the curve, which currently intersects near the $10,000 level. 

Supporting this view, analyst MilkyBull Crypto highlights a similar setup on Ethereum's monthly chart, noting that ETH's rally to $10,000 “can't be ruled out technically.”

Combined with RSI recovery from a multi-year support zone near 40, the setup adds further weight to the five-figure price target.

The bullish outlook for Ethereum is gaining traction as analysts anticipate an altcoin season in the coming months. 

Chartist Mister Crypto, for instance, argues that altcoins like ETH may rally 40% in a single day amid capital rotation from Bitcoin. 

The Altcoin Season Index, which has broken out of a downtrend just below the 29 level, signals a potential shift away from Bitcoin dominance. While still in “Bitcoin Season” territory (below 25), the breakout suggests altcoins like ETH may soon begin to outperform.

Additionally, Ethereum's top blockchain rival, Solana, is painting a rising wedge pattern against Ether, furthering its potential to decline in the coming weeks.

Related: Solana lacks ‘convincing signs' of besting Ethereum: Sygnum

The same picture can be seen against XRP, suggesting that more capital may flow toward Ethereum from rival altcoins in the coming days or weeks. 

As of May, Ether is reclaiming the lower trendline of its multi-year symmetrical triangle after a brief breakdown in March, while bouncing off its 200-2W exponential moving average (200-2W EMA; the blue wave) support. 

ETH's rebound confirms a bullish rejection, validating the ongoing consolidation structure.

This setup closely resembles ETH's past macro consolidations, namely the 2016 bull flag and the 2018–2020 falling wedge, both of which preceded major breakouts to new all-time highs.

A breakout above the current triangle consolidation could follow a similar trajectory, increasing the probability of ETH reaching the $10,000 mark — and even $20,000 if the breakout pans out per the rules of technical analysis.

After weeks of sideways consolidation and uncertainty, Ethereum appears to have flipped a major psychological and technical corner. Bullish momentum in the past five days has caused Ethereum's price action to surge past the $2,200 level with conviction, rising more than 32% in the past seven days alone. The breakout comes as Bitcoin crossed the six-figure mark again, lifting the broader crypto market along with it.

According to technical analysis of Ethereum's daily candlestick chart, this rally is more than just a reaction to Bitcoin; it is the start of a new long-term uptrend.

$2,200 Breakout Confirms Strength, Analyst Declares End Of Bear Market 

The recent surge has lifted Ethereum well beyond $2,000, a price level that acted as a ceiling in late March and early April. According to technical analysis posted on the TradingView platform by crypto analyst MasterAnanda, Ethereum's bear market is finally over. 

This comment was made in light of what the analyst called a real bullish action, coupled with really high volume in the past few days. This, in turn, confirms a very strong high in the coming weeks and days, where Ethereum will grow daily non-stop for months.

The recent rally has taken the price above the August 5, 2024, and February 3, 2025 lows, highlighted on a chart posted by the analyst on TradingView. The chart also shows that Ethereum broke free convincingly from a steep descending channel pattern that had trapped its price for months. 

The breakout is convincing because a large green candle accompanied by unusually high trading volume marked the breakout, lending credibility to the view that the bear phase is now over.

“This is only the start,” the analyst wrote, adding that Ethereum's path toward reclaiming its all-time highs is already underway.

$5,791 An ‘Easy' Target, $10,000 Before 2026 ‘Doable'

According to MasterAnanda's analysis, the current rally could easily carry Ethereum to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level near $5,791.78. He describes this target as “easy”, given the strength of the breakout and the capital inflow that appears to be building behind it. 

Reaching the $5,791 price target would translate to a breakout to uncharted price territories above Ethereum's current all-time high of $4,878. However, the prediction doesn't stop there. A $10,000 Ethereum is not only possible but likely before the end of 2025 due to institutional money and retail sentiment flooding into the market.

The chart illustrates Ethereum's recovery path with various Fibonacci levels mapped out, showing resistance and retracement points ranging from $2,421 at the 0.382 extension up to $5,791 at the 1.618 extension. 

The analyst noted that around $250 billion in capital could eventually flow into the crypto market during this wave, with $10 to $15 billion already in play. He argues that the euphoric phase will begin once the remaining capital enters.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,395.

Cryptocurrency markets are charging into the week with renewed bullish momentum, fueled by surging institutional interest, growing ETF-driven demand—particularly around Bitcoin—and a wave of favorable trading clarity is driving renewed investor confidence.

Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to a peak of $104,900 on Saturday evening—just about 4% below its all-time high—following President Donald Trump's announcement of progress in U.S.-China trade talks during a meeting in Switzerland.

“A very good meeting today with China, in Switzerland,” Trump posted on Truth Social, his social media platform. “Many things discussed, much agreed to. A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner.”

Bitcoin rallied on the heels of the news.

By early Sunday morning, the top cryptocurrency by volume hovered around $103,985. 

And yet, altcoins managed to grab the spotlight as well. At last check, Ethereum marked one of its strongest daily performances in recent weeks, while meme coins roared back to life. See below.

This altcoin rally coincides with a decrease in Bitcoin's market dominance to 63.89%, per TradingView. 

Analysts interpret this as a sign of capital rotation into altcoins, suggesting the onset of an “altcoin season.” The ETH/BTC ratio has rebounded from its lowest levels since 2020, further supporting this trend. 

Meanwhile, top U.S. and Chinese economic officials are expected to meet in Geneva for a second round of high-stakes trade talks to ease tensions from Trump's escalating trade war. 

The conflict has already led to steep tariffs—145% on Chinese goods and 125% on U.S. exports—disrupting global supply chains and prompting companies to seek alternatives. 

According to the New York Times, economists warn the ongoing dispute could slow global growth, raise inflation, and push the U.S. toward a recession.

2025 has seen the crypto market heat up significantly, with Ethereum (ETH) leading the charge and igniting an altcoin rally. The rising prices of altcoins have created a surge in interest across the market, with Ethereum's recent performance acting as a catalyst for further growth. However, while Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing a major bull run, Coldware (COLD) is also grabbing attention with its upcoming hardware release — the Larna 2400 mobile device — which could set Coldware apart from its competitors and fuel its growth in the RWA (Real-World Asset) tokenization sector.

Coldware's upcoming Larna 2400 mobile device is designed to bring Web3 functionality to mobile users in a seamless and accessible way. As Ethereum continues to push the crypto market to new heights, Coldware is taking the next big step in ensuring that decentralized finance and Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization reach a broader audience. The Larna 2400 will empower users to engage with RWA tokenization directly from their mobile devices, making blockchain technology more accessible and usable for everyday applications.

Coldware's hardware release is expected to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and the broader financial markets, allowing for easy and secure tokenization of real-world assets such as real estate, commodities, and more. By providing users with a secure way to manage and trade assets, Coldware (COLD) is making RWA tokenization more practical and relevant than ever before.

Ethereum's price surge has been nothing short of spectacular, crossing the $2,450 mark and drawing attention from institutional investors and retail traders alike. Ethereum's rise is propelled by its Pectra upgrade, which has made the Ethereum network more scalable and user-friendly. The recent price increase of 10% in just a few days highlights the immense potential of Ethereum, and as it continues to rise, the crypto market as a whole is benefiting from the momentum.

The Pectra upgrade has improved the network's efficiency, making it more attractive for decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. This, coupled with Ethereum's continued dominance, has led many analysts to predict that Ethereum may soon approach its all-time high of $4,864.06. Ethereum's performance and the growing market interest have set the stage for an altcoin season, with many altcoins like Solana (SOL) also gaining significant traction.

However, amidst this bullish rally, Coldware (COLD) has positioned itself to stand out with the Larna 2400 mobile device — a revolutionary Web3 hardware release that could significantly impact the landscape of decentralized finance and asset tokenization.

While Ethereum's continued success is setting the stage for an altcoin rally, Coldware's Larna 2400 device will play a pivotal role in distinguishing Coldware (COLD) from other players in the market. Coldware's hardware release could complement Ethereum's ongoing advancements, providing a new layer of functionality for blockchain-based finance and asset tokenization.

As Ethereum pushes past its previous price highs and other altcoins experience significant growth, Coldware is aligning itself for the future of decentralized finance. The integration of RWA tokenization with Coldware's mobile device is expected to be a game-changer, positioning Coldware (COLD) as a market leader in a rapidly evolving space.

The rise of Ethereum has undoubtedly set the tone for 2025, and Coldware (COLD) is poised to ride this wave of momentum. While Ethereum's rise shows no signs of slowing down, Coldware's Web3 hardware release will enable a seamless experience for users to engage in RWA tokenization, positioning it as a leader in this new frontier.

As the market continues to evolve, Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself to become a central player in the decentralized finance ecosystem. With its Larna 2400 release on the horizon, Coldware is set to separate itself from other altcoin rivals and become a leader in the space, alongside Ethereum (ETH).

NFT is one of those phenomena that has become both a symbol of innovation and an object of skepticism. Periods of hype, million-dollar auctions, and the ensuing downturn have created buzz, but not always an explanation. Why are some NFTs worth millions while others disappear into the blockchain without a trace? Why are NFTs valuable?

This question is less about fashion or speculation and more about the nature of digital ownership, demand, utility, and the context in which these assets exist.

NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, have raised many questions since their rapid emergence into the mass market, from fundamental to market questions. One of the key ones is: why do NFTs have any value at all? To understand this, it is important to move beyond the image of the “expensive JPEG” and look at NFTs as a data structure and legal-technological form designed to represent a unique digital asset.

At the most basic level, the NFT is a way to prove digital uniqueness and establish ownership in the digital space. It is not just a file but a token fixed in a blockchain that references a particular object (digital or physical) and confirms its origin, owner, and, potentially, terms of use.

NFTs' value does not come solely from the very content to which they can be attached – be it an image, music, in-game item, or digital certificate. Their value is a combination of several factors: technical uniqueness, legally programmable ownership, contextual relevance, and audience and market perception. NFTs may be meaningless outside of a particular cultural, economic, or social context – but in the right bundle, they become a carrier of value, status, access, or function.

So, to explain NFT value in simple terms, it is a mechanism embedded in blockchain that allows any digital object to become a private, transferable, trackable asset. And in a world where digital dominates, NFT becomes a tool for expressing and validating value, even if that value is subjective or symbolic.

Any market starts with scarcity. But in the digital space, where every object can be copied infinitely, classical economic laws are no longer valid. In this reality, NFT economics requires new tools – those that can programmatically specify the scarcity, provability, and logical origin of an asset.

In NFT economics, the key is not the cost of production but the architecture of output. ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards allow the developer to specify supply parameters at the contract level, including properties like maxSupply, totalMinted, and tokenId. These are not declarations – they are enforceable logic built into the blockchain itself. Therefore, one of the central factors that make NFTs valuable is that the scarcity, visual attributes, and behavioral logic for interacting with NFTs are written as open, executable code. Not a promise – but a rule.

In this system, scarcity and uniqueness in NFTs are the ways how to evaluate NFT worth:





Hence, what makes an NFT rare: it is either a statistically unique combination of attributes (e.g., 1 out of 3 tokens with a gold frame) or external factors – ownership history (provenance), participation in a certain phase of the drop, peculiarities of mining (e.g., via allowlist, auction, claim). Such data is stored in metadata and often aggregated by rarity calculation systems like rarity.tools or Trait Sniper.

The market reacts to these characteristics in a clear and pragmatic way. How digital scarcity impacts NFT prices is not just a question of demand for price but demand for structure. Collections with an open unlimited mint lose value because it is impossible to calculate the supply cap. On the contrary, projects with clear constraints (maxSupply + burn logic + locked mint) and transparent distribution show more stable pricing and liquidity. Prices rise not on “arts” but on guarantees that this token is rare, verifiable, and non-dilutable.

Therefore, today's evaluation is based not on emotions but on-chain analytics: rarity rank, uniqueness score, volume velocity, and time-to-resale. In addition, such parameters as availability of royalty logic (EIP-2981), market activity, and decentralization of ownership are important for institutional players. The higher the turnover of a token among unique wallets, the higher the perceived utility and real marketability.

Finally, all these principles are directly reflected in NFT market trends and pricing. Since the beginning of 2024, there has been a growing interest in collections where the issuance architecture is built as a modular system – where each token is not just unique but is part of a broader logic: gamification, multi-level rarity, dynamic attributes (on-chain mutable metadata). Such NFTs become not just objects of the collection but the basis for building complex secondary activity markets.

As you have already realized, in the digital environment, owning an object without owning the infrastructure in which that object lives becomes fiction. This is where NFT comes into play – as a mechanism that, for the first time, makes it possible to explicitly link ownership to the technical ability to validate, transfer, and monetize a digital asset. And this fundamentally changes the very nature of ownership on the Internet.

The central concept here is digital ownership and NFT value. While classic digital ownership (e.g. an account on a platform) depends on a centralized registry and administrator rights, NFT offers a model in which the right to an asset is decentralized, verifiable, and continuously available for verification. It is not just a file or link – it is a token containing a unique identifier, owner address, and metadata, including potential terms of use or license.

This is really what gives NFTs their value. The value of an NFT doesn't necessarily come from the linked content itself – it comes from transparency, alienability, and enforceability. An NFT owner doesn't just hold a token – they can transfer it, own and earn royalty, and use it in dApp ecosystems, DAO platforms, or GameFi engines.

One of the most important elements of this structure becomes the logic of NFTs and creator royalties. Standards like EIP-2981 allow royalty parameters to be set directly in the contract – for example, 5% of each secondary sale. These rules do not require platform involvement: if the marketplace respects the royalty logic, it is enforced automatically. This sets a precedent for a decentralized royalty economy, where the content creator gets a share of every transaction regardless of jurisdiction or platform.

But what are the real application benefits for the owner? At the user level, it could be access to a private community, a role in the governance of the DAO, a license for commercial use, gaming functionality, or even renting a token (via ERC-4907). This gives rise to what makes an NFT worth buying – not only the prospect of price appreciation but also the current functional utility. The market is increasingly valuing an NFT not as a “valuable JPEG” but as a token of access, license, reputation, or profitability.

Hence the logical question, which is often heard publicly – do NFTs actually have real value? The answer is yes, if we consider value not as aesthetics, but as an enforceable right embedded in the code. An NFT can be:





This is not a metaphor for ownership – it is its formalization in a protocol, and this is what gives NFT real, not declarative, value.

NFT is a tool, but the market often treats it as an artifact. While we've covered the technical reasons why tokens can have value, it's impossible to ignore the flip side: a huge amount of market activity in NFTs is based not on utility, but on speculation.

This is what is at the heart of the NFT utility vs speculation debate. Most of the high-profile headlines involving tens of millions of dollars in sales were not about what the token provided in terms of access, function, or economic mechanism, but what it symbolized. NFT has evolved into a form of social capital – digital status validated by blockchain. While this in itself is a form of value, a legitimate question arises: is NFT value based on hype or utility?

The answer is in the balance. Some projects do provide functionality: access to closed DAO, delegated voting, and cross-platform game assets. However, the majority of market volume is provided by the movement of funds between traders who rely on subsequent resale. This leads to the fact that tokens are purchased not for use, but for profit. Therefore, waves of hype, pump&dump scenarios, and short-term bursts of interest occur.

So, you can ask: why are NFTs worth money if the obvious utility is missing? More often than not, it's because of the narrative. A collection receives focus from opinion leaders, appears on top marketplaces, quickly disperses in the mint phase – and an attention spiral is triggered, within which the price becomes a self-sustaining effect. In this case, not only demand plays its role but also the expectation of demand. Price ceases to be a reflection of utility – and becomes a reflection of shared belief.

And why do people pay millions for NFTs? In a world where art auctions work as marketing campaigns, this behavior is not unique. Some people buy NFTs for status, some for entry into a social club, and some for the certainty of growth. Price becomes a form of demonstrative participation in future success. 

In this sense, NFTs resemble speculative early-stage technology assets: expensive not because they already generate revenue, but because they promise potential. Ultimately, answering why are some NFTs so expensive? – the answer may not always be technologically or functionally justified. Often it's an artifact of a good moment, meme culture, or nostalgia. Often it's the result of limited release, successful visual metaphor, and collective speculation.

When we discuss the value of NFTs, the question naturally arises: can an algorithm provide an objective answer to it in the same way as it performs with regular crypto?

This is where the AI explanation of NFT value immediately faces a limitation. Most models, including LLMs, don't have on-chain access, don't analyze contracts directly, and most importantly don't consider all the user behavioral patterns. They can aggregate information, and draw conclusions based on correlations, but aren't able to evaluate the asset as a market participant. Consequently, if we ask the question: how does AI understand NFT value? – the answer will be: mainly through the description of secondary attributes: number of mentions, trading volume, and visual context, and not through analyzing the actual structure of the token.

Moreover, predicting the success of a particular NFT is even more difficult than a token. Why? Because, unlike cryptocurrency, NFTs are almost always unique. This complicates model training, makes mass sampling impossible, and calls into question the very idea of a universal “valuation algorithm.” In this sense, can AI tell if an NFT is a good investment? – Rather no than yes. An algorithm can point to market metrics, but not context: meme effect, cultural shift, relevance of visual narrative, hidden community dynamics. And these are the metrics that often determine the outcome.

Can AI explain why NFTs have value? I would say that the right question is different: Is AI alone capable of uncovering it?

NFTs have long been seen as an overrated speculation – because their actual use case has not yet arrived. They were positioned as a solution for artists and collectors, but the early market turned them into a hype tool. However, with the advent of generative AI, it became clear: the problems of verification, authorship, and ethical use of data are systemic, large-scale, and technologically unsolved.

Modern models are trained on unlabeled and unverified datasets. Content is generated in unaccountable volumes. Copyrights are erased, licenses are lost, and provenance disappears. No one – neither the user, nor the regulator, nor the algorithm itself – can determine where the information came from, who has rights to it, and under what conditions it was used.

And this is where NFTs show their true essence. Not just as an investment asset, but as a trust structure:





So, I would say that NFTs are becoming not something that AI must evaluate, but something without which AI cannot be ethical, trustworthy, and reproducible. They may have come early. But that doesn't mean they were unnecessary. I would say the opposite: they were just waiting for their real challenge.

NFTs have survived a rapid takeoff, a market distortion, and a crisis of perception. But all that can be just the first cycle – because their architecture solves much more fundamental problems. The value of NFTs goes far beyond market price to create a capability that combines uniqueness and scarcity, ownership and royalty sharing, verification infrastructure, and automated trust.

With the advent of AI, it is clear: these properties are not superstructures, but something that should be sewn into the digital environment by default. NFTs don't just fit this future – they were designed for it. And only now are we beginning to realize this.

Walking into the crowded hotel conference room, Andrew Batey looked like any other tech guy attending ETHDenver, an annual cryptocurrency conference. A venture capital investor based in Florida, Mr. Batey wore a black sweatshirt emblazoned with the logos of more than a dozen crypto companies, with names like LunarCrush and bitSmiley. He had arrived in town with some expensive footwear — a pair of Off-White Air Jordans, the type of sneaker, he said, that people usually don't take out of the box.

Mr. Batey, however, was at the conference not to network with fellow crypto enthusiasts but to fight one of them — live on YouTube. At the hotel, a short drive from the conference convention center, he was preparing for his official weigh-in, the final step before a fight the next evening in an arena packed with crypto colleagues. Under the watchful eye of a representative from the Colorado Combative Sports Commission, Mr. Batey, 40, stripped down to his boxers, which were adorned with a cartoon Santa Claus riding a golf cart.

He weighed in at just under 195 pounds, on target for the fight. The bare-chested venture capitalist raised his biceps and flexed for the cameras.

The nation's tech elite, not content with unfathomable wealth and rising political influence in Washington, have recently developed a new obsession — fighting. Across the United States, men like Mr. Batey are learning to punch, kick, knee, elbow and, in some cases, hammer an opponent over the head with their fists. The figurehead of the movement is Mark Zuckerberg, the billionaire chief executive of Meta, who has charted his impressive physical transformation from skinny computer nerd to martial arts fighter on Instagram, one of the apps he owns. A recent post showed Mr. Zuckerberg, dressed in gym shorts and an American flag T-shirt, grappling his opponent to the ground.

The tech industry's newfound devotion to martial arts is one facet of a broader cultural shift that has upended U.S. politics. Many of these tech founders turned fighters are chasing a testosterone-heavy ideal of masculinity that is ascendant on social media and embraced by President Trump. An enthusiastic practitioner of Brazilian jujitsu, Mr. Zuckerberg, 40, lamented this year that corporate culture was getting “neutered” and was devoid of “masculine energy.” In 2023, Mr. Zuckerberg's fellow billionaire Elon Musk, a longtime corporate rival, challenged him to a televised cage match. The fight never took place, though Mr. Musk suggested at one point that he was willing to do battle in the Roman Colosseum.

Howard Wu is the founder of Aleo and CEO of Provable, a company building tools for confidential, compliant payments and developer infrastructure on zero-knowledge blockchains. A UC Berkeley graduate with a background in cryptography and verifiable computing, Wu has co-authored Zexe and DIZK—zero-knowledge systems adopted by Ethereum, Zcash, and others.

The views expressed here are his own and do not necessarily represent those of Decrypt.

When you pay with a stablecoin like USDC, you may be giving up more than just money. 

As long as you're transacting on a public blockchain, a merchant—or anyone, for that matter—can view your wallet, analyze your past transactions, and use or sell your personal financial history.

This feature isn't a minor inconvenience. It's why serious institutions, from major banks to government entities, hesitate to adopt blockchain technology. 

Financial entities, corporations, and sovereign funds would be worse off if sensitive information, such as treasury operations, trading strategies, and quarterly financial movements, became public knowledge. 

What's needed is a way for these systems to transact confidentially and securely, while demonstrating compliance.

Fortunately, a solution has been emerging for some time. 

Zero-knowledge proofs, a breakthrough in cryptography, offer a way to preserve the open, decentralized nature of blockchains while introducing the confidentiality and control that serious institutions require. 

Public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum were designed to prioritize transparency and openness. This works well for censorship resistance and trustless systems that assume everyone involved is better off with everything out in the open. 

But for highly regulated organizations or strategically discrete financial entities, this radical transparency becomes a structural weakness.

For instance, most banks operate under confidentiality norms enforced by legal contractual obligations, and payment providers must protect user data under existing frameworks.

As a result, publicly revealing counterparty exposure or transaction timing can create market manipulation risks and breach fiduciary duties. 

Similarly, if a government agency used public rails to coordinate emergency aid or military procurement, adversaries could infer national priorities or operational timelines from transaction metadata alone. 

In both cases, the consequences of an information breach could be economically or strategically catastrophic.

Even attempts to “mask” activity using pseudonymous wallets or mixers have proven inadequate. Chain surveillance tools routinely de-anonymize addresses by mapping wallet interactions and analyzing on-chain behavior. 

In effect, using public blockchains for institutional finance today is like trying to run a business on a public spreadsheet that anyone worldwide can monitor and scrape.

Zero-knowledge proofs offer a cryptographic alternative to the binary choice between full transparency and complete opacity. 

ZKPs allow one party to mathematically prove a statement is true without revealing the underlying data that makes it true. 

For example, a company can prove that its on-chain assets exceed its liabilities without revealing wallet addresses or asset breakdowns. 

In practical terms, ZKPs enable selective disclosure, meaning institutions can comply with regulatory obligations, such as AML screening or sanctions checks, while still preserving the confidentiality of their operational data. 

Instead of posting raw data to the chain, they post a proof that certain conditions have been met, which is publicly verifiable without ever exposing a transaction or user's underlying details.

This is an absolute game-changer. For the first time in history, entities can prove who they are, what they have, or what they've done without revealing any of this information directly. 

Until recently, identity, compliance, solvency, and governance have required disclosure, but with zero-knowledge technology, they require only proof. As a result, institutions no longer have to choose between operational secrecy and on-chain accountability. 

Institutions that have tried to use public blockchains for serious applications have already discovered these limitations firsthand. As a result, we're now seeing a proliferation of zk-based solutions tailor-built for real-world, institutional needs.

One of the latest examples is JP Morgan's Kinexys, a private blockchain designed for tokenized cash settlements and interbank messaging. Kinexys allows participants to tokenize assets and execute transactions with confidentiality guarantees enforced at the protocol level. 

Compliance checks, identity attestations, and settlement proofs can be performed without disclosing underlying business data. 

The system aligns with the privacy requirements of large financial institutions, which is why it has been integrated into the Partior cross-border settlement network alongside DBS and Standard Chartered.

The fact that one of the world's most conservative banks felt the need to build its own private blockchain infrastructure speaks volumes—and they are far from alone. 

Beyond the explosion in zk-focused businesses and startups, major government entities from the U.S. Department of Defense to the European Commission are exploring ways to leverage ZKP for secure data sharing in high-stakes environments. 

Clearly, institutions want the benefits of programmable money and atomic settlement, but not at the expense of leaking proprietary information.

When every transaction is visible to the world, businesses and governments face an impossible trade-off between leveraging next-generation financial infrastructure and protecting sensitive information. 

For the technology to underpin payroll, sovereign reserves, cross-border commerce, and institutional settlement networks, it must evolve to meet the standards of privacy and risk control expected in high-stakes finance.

Privacy is not a side quest. It is the cornerstone of scalable, secure, and compliant finance. 

If we want the world's leading financial institutions and public entities to embrace digital assets fully, the blockchain industry must meet them where they are, with cryptographic tools that align with how they operate. 

Zero-knowledge technology is how we get there.

They crypto bull move continued into the weekend thanks to a trio of positive macro developments.

Likely most responsible for the move was a President Trump Truth Social post regarding trade talks being held in Switzerland between the U.S. and China.

""A very good meeting today,"" said Trump. ""Many things discussed, much agreed to,"" he continued. ""A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner. We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!""

Earlier Saturday, Trump also announced a ""full and immediate"" ceasefire in the brewing war between India and Pakistan.

Completing the trio of good news, Russian President Putin said he was ""in the mood for serious talks with Ukraine,"" and suggested talks ""without preconditions"" in Turkey next week.

Bitcoin (BTC) rose to just a few dollars short of $105,000 before pulling back to the current $104,500, ahead 1.5% over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH) has continued its recent outperformance, up 7.7% over the same time frame.

Stephen is CoinDesk's managing editor for Markets. He previously served as managing editor at Seeking Alpha. A native of suburban Washington, D.C., Stephen went to the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, majoring in finance. He holds BTC above CoinDesk's disclosure threshold of $1,000.

 Former UFC champ Conor McGregor, now a presidential candidate in Ireland, has proposed creating a national Bitcoin reserve as part of his campaign. 

UFC fighter turned Irish political candidate Conor McGregor has endorsed the idea of building a Bitcoin reserve in his country to give more “power back to the people.”

“Crypto in it's origin was founded to give power back to the people. An Irish Bitcoin strategic reserve will give power to the people's money,” McGregor wrote to X on May 9.

The former UFC champion said he would discuss his plans in more detail in an upcoming X spaces, prompting responses from some of the Bitcoin industry's most prominent leaders.

“We need the greatest minds for this BTC Reserve. Message me and lets chat on my space,” McGregor said in response to Bitcoiner and host of The Pomp Podcast, Anthony Pompliano.

One of US President Donald Trump's crypto advisors, David Bailey, also reached out, to which McGregor responded: “David message me, let's discuss your ideas!” 

McGregor announced his independent candidacy for the Irish presidency in late March 2025, centering his campaign on anti-immigration policies and combating crime.

Ireland's next presidential election must take place by Nov. 11, 2025, as the term of the current President, Michael D. Higgins, is set to end the day after.

Establishing a Bitcoin reserve — let alone one coming from a minor, independent party — would be no easy feat.

Despite recent regulatory progress, the US, El Salvador and Bhutan are among the few countries that have established a Bitcoin reserve to date.

McGregor's political visibility was recently boosted by a trip to the White House, where he met Trump and received his support.

However, McGregor is facing intense scrutiny in Ireland, having recently been found guilty of sexual assault in a civil case — a conviction which he has since appealed — while also previously being investigated for hate speech crimes.

McGregor's last crypto endeavor failed

McGregor's push for a Bitcoin reserve comes a little over a month after the McGregor-backed REAL project failed to attract sufficient funding in its token launch pre-sale, prompting a full refund to all token bidders.

The team behind the project, Real World Gaming, only raised $392,315 over a 28-hour presale on April 5 and 6, less than half of the $1 million minimum requirement that it initially set.

 Ethereum's Pectra upgrade introduces offchain wallet delegation via EIP-7702, allowing attackers to drain funds using just a signed message. 

Ethereum's latest network upgrade, Pectra, introduced powerful new features aimed at improving scalability and smart account functionality — but it also opened a dangerous new attack vector that could allow hackers to drain funds from user wallets using only an offchain signature.

Under the Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7 at epoch 364032, attackers can exploit a new transaction type to take control of externally owned accounts (EOAs) without requiring the user to sign an onchain transaction.

Arda Usman, a Solidity smart contract auditor, confirmed to Cointelegraph that “it becomes possible for an attacker to drain an EOA's funds using only an offchain signed message (no direct onchain transaction signed by the user).”

At the center of the risk is EIP-7702, a core component of the Pectra upgrade. The Ethereum Improvement Proposal introduces the SetCode transaction (type 0x04), which enables users to delegate control of their wallet to another contract simply by signing a message.

If an attacker obtains this signature — say, via a phishing site — they can overwrite the wallet's code with a small proxy that forwards calls to their malicious contract.

“Once the code is set,” Usman explained, “the attacker can invoke that code to transfer out the account's ETH or tokens—all without the user ever signing a normal transfer transaction.”

Yehor Rudytsia, onchain researcher at Hacken, noted that this new transaction type introduced by Pectra allows arbitrary code to be installed on the user's account, essentially turning their wallet into a programmable smart contract.

“This tx type allows the user to set arbitrary code (smart contract) to be able to execute operations on the user's behalf,” Rudytsia said.

Before Pectra, wallets could not be modified without a transaction signed directly by the user. Now, a simple offchain signature can install code that delegates complete control to an attacker's contract.

“Pre-Pectra, users needed to send transaction (not sign message) to allow their funds to be moved… Post-Pectra, any operation may be executed from the contract which user approved via SET_CODE,” Rudytsia explained.

The threat is real and immediate. “Pectra activated May 7, 2025. From that moment, any valid delegation signature is actionable,” Usman warned. He added that smart contracts relying on outdated assumptions, such as using tx.origin or basic EOA-only checks, are particularly vulnerable.

Wallets and interfaces that fail to detect or properly represent these new transaction types are most at risk. Rudytsia warned that “wallets are vulnerable if they do not analyze Ethereum's transaction types,” especially transaction type 0x04.

He emphasized that wallet engines must clearly display delegation requests and flag any suspicious addresses.

This new form of attack can be easily executed through common offchain interactions like phishing emails, fake DApps, or Discord scams.

“We believe it will be the most popular attack vector regarding these breaking changes introduced by Pectra,” Rudytsia said. “From now on, users have to carefully validate what they are going to sign.”

Hardware wallets are no longer inherently safer, Rudytsia said. He added that hardware wallets from now on are at the same risk as hot wallets from the perspective of signing malicious messages. “If done—all the funds are gone in a moment.”

There are ways to stay safe, but they require awareness. “Users should not sign the messages they do not understand,” Rudytsia advised. He also urged wallet developers to provide clear warnings when users are asked to sign a delegation message.

Special caution should be taken with new delegation signature formats introduced by EIP-7702, which are not compatible with existing EIP-191 or EIP-712 standards. These messages often appear as simple 32-byte hashes and may bypass normal wallet warnings.

“If a message includes your account nonce, it's probably affecting your account directly,” Usman warned. “Normal sign-in messages or offchain commitments don't usually involve your nonce.”

Adding to the risk, EIP-7702 allows for signatures with chain_id = 0, meaning the signed message can be replayed on any Ethereum-compatible chain. “Understand it can be used anywhere,” Usman said.

While multisignature wallets remain more secure under this upgrade, thanks to their requirement for multiple signers, single-key wallets — hardware or otherwise — must adopt new signature parsing and red-flagging tools to prevent potential exploitation.

Alongside EIP-7702, Pectra also included EIP-7251, which raised Ethereum's validator staking limit from 32 to 2,048 ETH, and EIP-7691, which increases the number of data blobs per block for better layer-2 scalability.

 Worldcoin's Orb Mini device was met with mockery across Crypto Twitter, as critics questioned its ethics and usefulness. 

Worldcoin's latest hardware, the Orb Mini, aimed at enabling portable human verification, has been met with ridicule across Crypto Twitter.

Launched with the slogan “It goes where you go,” the device has instead triggered dystopian comparisons and widespread mockery for its unsettling implications and unclear use case.

“The thing about humans is they can tell when a human is in front of them,” Alicia Katz from decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Euler Finance wrote on X.

“When something is slightly off, they can experience the uncanny valley, an uncomfortable feeling similar to when your date tries to scan your eyeball,” she added.

Another user quipped, “Is this so you can register your friends?” likening the device to a sci-fi prop rather than a serious identity solution.

The Orb Mini is a portable iris-scanning device that creates a unique World ID for users stored on the blockchain. Resembling a smartphone with visible eye sensors, it's a smaller, more accessible version of Worldcoin's original Orb.

Unveiled at the “At Last” event in San Francisco on April 30, the device is part of a broader push by Tools for Humanity, which also plans to roll out 7,500 Orb units across the US by year-end.

Several prominent voices raised concerns over security, ethics, and basic practicality.

“What real-life problem does this solve?” one user asked, while others mocked its vulnerability to spoofing, with one tweet suggesting the device “could be fooled by a half-decent AI render of a human.”

In the same thread, one user sarcastically recommended a “rectal probe” for more secure identity checks, claiming, “Every human's anal print is unique.”

Critics also slammed the device's social implications. Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten called the Orb Mini a “creepy dystopia-shilling” tool, suggesting the product reflects insecurity among its creators rather than solving any real trust issue.

Worldcoin's push to make biometric identity tools mainstream continues to face resistance, especially as privacy advocates raise questions about decentralization, surveillance, and bodily autonomy.

On May 5, the company, backed by Sam Altman's Tools for Humanity, faced challenges in Indonesia after local regulators temporarily suspended its registration certificates.

Several global regulators have pushed back on World's operations since its launch in July 2023, with governments like Germany, Kenya and Brazil expressing concerns over potential risks to the security of users' biometric data.

There have always been two major issues with 3D displays: No one wants to wear 3D glasses, and there has never been enough content to take advantage of the technology.

Samsung's new Odyssey 3D monitor (G90XF) wants to solve these problems in one fell swoop. It uses a lenticular lens and eye-tracking cameras to create a convincing 3D effect to bring PC games to life. It costs a hefty $2,000, a steep price considering how good (and affordable) gaming monitors are nowadays, but the Odyssey brings the 3D technology to the PC in a way that feels like the future we've always dreamed of.

You can't capture or see 3D with just a camera, and that's one of the biggest challenges in describing the experience of using the Samsung Odyssey 3D. You do have to see it with your own eyes to believe it. While that can be true of other important monitor technologies, whether it's resolution, refresh rate, or HDR, 3D is something everyone will want to try at least once.

If you've seen a movie in 3D, you get the idea. Your eyes are tricked into thinking the images are moving toward you in three dimensions. Elements in a game, such as a character or even a dialog window, spring off the screen. The system uses the 3D cameras to not only track your head movement, but predict it. That's the secret sauce in providing a wider “sweet spot” for the 3D to stay in effect. The recommended distance is between 27 and 40 inches, which gives you lots of wiggle room to get comfortable. It's possible to sit too close or far away, but I never felt like I had to stay still or compromise my comfort to stay in view.

That's a big step forward from where this technology was just a few years ago, though there are still limitations. You can't have multiple people in front of the monitor at once, and there are both resolution and PC hardware requirements to be aware of. You have to play the game at full-screen in native resolution, and you'll need at least an Nvidia RTX 3070 graphics card. That rules out many lesser-powered PCs, as well as AMD video cards. You also need to have HDR turned off to play games in 3D.

The biggest limitation, though, is game support. A mere 12 titles are supported officially, and they aren't well known. There are a couple of popular games like Palworld and Stray, but they also include several lesser-known kids' games like The Smurfs: Dreams and SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake. Only The First Berserker: Khazan is labeled as a “co-developed” title. Samsung has been light on details as to what this certification indicates, but unlike the other 11, the developer had to be involved in the 3D implementation in some sense. Samsung promises that there will be 11 more of these “co-developed” releases by the end of the year and as many as 50 generally compatible 3D games.

While that's a good on-ramp, Samsung is attempting to catch up with the vast library of compatible titles in Acer's SpatialLabs ecosystem in support of its Predator SpatialLabs View 27 and other 3D display products. Acer has been building that library for years, so there's a large, notable disparity. On the other hand, the quality of what Samsung has achieved, specifically with the experience in The First Berserker: Khazan, is a step ahead of anything I've seen. At the very least, Samsung should be selling this bundled with a free copy of that game, given the highly limited game selection.

The Samsung Odyssey 3D isn't the first of its kind, but it's the one that feels most like a legitimate product. It's a gorgeous monitor, using a silver chassis similar to the ones on other Odyssey monitors I've enjoyed. While it's an experimental concept monitor for gamers, Samsung has done a fantastic job of making it appear like a standard screen. Yes, it has a wide stand and a large top bezel for its eye-tracking cameras, but other than that, you wouldn't assume this is an early-adopter product. That's unlike the aforementioned Acer Predator SpatialLabs View 27, which doesn't look or feel nearly as high-end.

The setup is fairly simple, though it requires a few things to get started. First off, you need the Reality Hub app launcher to actually play games in 3D. It's too bad it requires a separate app, but the software at least will scan your game libraries and display any supported games. Beyond that, you'll need to plug in the attached USB-A cable, along with whatever you're using for the display itself. I hooked it up to a gaming laptop, and it worked fine.

You'll find the ports on the monitor around the back, which offer the bare minimum, including two HDMI ports, DisplayPort, and two USB-A downstream ports. No headphone jack and no USB-C. On the right of the port array, you'll find the power button, which also serves as the controls for the OSD (on-screen display). The menu is fine, though I was annoyed by how many clicks it took to get to brightness or volume controls.

It comes with a pair of 5-watt speakers, which are decent but not anything special. They have “directional sound,” giving sound effects some added immersion. However, in my test period, the audio was clearer and fuller with the 3D spatial speakers of the Acer monitor.

You'll buy this monitor for its 3D capabilities, but in reality, you'll use it in standard 2D far more often. That's why Samsung was smart to ensure it didn't compromise on the quality of the display. While I do hope an OLED is introduced in the future, the Odyssey 3D uses a high-quality 4K IPS panel with a 165-Hz refresh rate to make sure that gaming in 2D is still an enjoyable experience.

Color coverage is solid (100 percent sRGB, 83 percent AdobeRGB), and color accuracy is excellent. I measured it at 0.83 with my colorimeter, comparable to OLED panels. In SDR, this is also a brighter panel than most OLEDs, reaching 487 nits of max brightness. It won't be nearly as impressive in HDR, but as it turns out, 3D games aren't supported in HDR anyway. Suffice to say, it's a solid 4K gaming monitor on its own—if only it weren't for the exorbitant price.

But the point is 3D, and I tried out a number of the compatible games, including Palworld, GTA: San Andreas, Stray, and SpongeBob. Each game I tried utilizes the 3D effect well enough, though you'll run across some cutscenes or in-game situations that don't work well, such as the opening sequence of GTA: San Andreas. You can dial back or pump up the 3D effect with simple keyboard commands. These games run on the Unreal Engine 4 engine, allowing Samsung to approve them without requiring additional developer work. Samsung hasn't announced support for other game engines like Unreal 5 or Unity.

The real showcase of the technology is The First Berserker: Khazan. Samsung worked directly with the developer for the 3D integration, and the result is spectacular. The highly stylized action game shows just how much the 3D effect can add to the immersion of the game. In the opening sequence, the snow doesn't just fall around the character—you're right there in the flurry, soaking up the atmosphere in a way that isn't possible in 2D. It's less about the action of the game suddenly jumping toward you—like you might expect in a 3D movie—and more about being submerged into the world. That's important because in a game that requires your attention in battles, you don't want the 3D elements to distract. After playing for 30 minutes, you'll find yourself getting used to the extra dimension. If you're like me, you won't want to go back.

The 3D technology isn't explicitly exclusive to games. The monitor can also convert 2D images and videos into 3D, which is fun to experiment with. There are several restrictions, such as the requirement to be in full screen and DRM-protected content. That means you won't be watching full movies in 3D anytime soon.

But watching clips of films or trailers on YouTube shows just how promising it could be if Samsung can get around the DRM problem. So long as they are full screen and with only one other person, you can even use it on video calls, which I tried out. It's pretty incredible, emulating something akin to a toned-down version of Google's Project Starline.

The 3D conversion uses AI to create a depth map to predict where the layers of depth should be. As you may have guessed, it's far from a perfect effect. You can see the AI slop fraying on the edges, and the level of depth is nowhere near as lifelike as it is in games. It also soaks up some performance, causing the Razer Blade 16 I was using to kick its loud fans on.

No one should rush out and buy the Samsung Odyssey 3D. It's expensive, and the list of compatible titles is embarrassingly small. At $2,000, you'll pay a lot for the privilege of testing out the tech. With how good gaming monitors are nowadays, you're paying well over $1,000 for the 3D here. Most people should buy an incredible OLED gaming monitor, which costs roughly $800.

I can't help but be excited by it. For me, it was not unlike trying out virtual reality for the first time. 3D is not nearly as immersive, but not requiring a headset or glasses feels like magic. While I'm not sure I'd want to play every game in 3D, there's so much less fatigue, making this a more practical technology over anything wearable. This monitor has made me genuinely excited about the future of 3D displays. While I wait for a future where the entire Windows operating system can be navigated in 3D—both in games and not—the Samsung Odyssey 3D monitor feels like a glimpse into the future.

It won't be the last of this technology, as Samsung tells me. (Samsung hosted WIRED at a media event in Seattle and paid for a portion of our reporter's travel expenses. We received a review unit shortly after.) If you're only marginally interested, you shouldn't have to wait too long before we see some (hopefully) more affordable options on the market.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Intelligence on Earth Evolved Independently at Least Twice","https://www.wired.com/story/intelligence-evolved-at-least-twice-in-vertebrate-animals/","Sun, 11 May 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

Humans tend to put our own intelligence on a pedestal. Our brains can do math, employ logic, explore abstractions, and think critically. But we can't claim a monopoly on thought. Among a variety of nonhuman species known to display intelligent behavior, birds have been shown time and again to have advanced cognitive abilities. Ravens plan for the future, crows count and use tools, cockatoos open and pillage booby-trapped garbage cans, and chickadees keep track of tens of thousands of seeds cached across a landscape. Notably, birds achieve such feats with brains that look completely different from ours: They're smaller and lack the highly organized structures that scientists associate with mammalian intelligence.

“A bird with a 10-gram brain is doing pretty much the same as a chimp with a 400-gram brain,” said Onur Güntürkün, who studies brain structures at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. “How is it possible?”

Researchers have long debated about the relationship between avian and mammalian intelligences. One possibility is that intelligence in vertebrates—animals with backbones, including mammals and birds—evolved once. In that case, both groups would have inherited the complex neural pathways that support cognition from a common ancestor: a lizardlike creature that lived 320 million years ago, when Earth's continents were squished into one landmass. The other possibility is that the kinds of neural circuits that support vertebrate intelligence evolved independently in birds and mammals.

It's hard to track down which path evolution took, given that any trace of the ancient ancestor's actual brain vanished in a geological blink. So biologists have taken other approaches—such as comparing brain structures in adult and developing animals today—to piece together how this kind of neurobiological complexity might have emerged.

A series of studies published in Science in February 2025 provides the best evidence yet that birds and mammals did not inherit the neural pathways that generate intelligence from a common ancestor, but rather evolved them independently. This suggests that vertebrate intelligence arose not once, but multiple times. Still, their neural complexity didn't evolve in wildly different directions: Avian and mammalian brains display surprisingly similar circuits, the studies found.

“It's a milestone in the quest to understand and to integrate the different ideas about the evolution” of vertebrate intelligence, said Güntürkün, who was not involved in the new research.

When Fernando García-Moreno started his lab at the Achucarro Basque Center for Neuroscience, he knew he wanted to probe how the pallium region of the vertebrate brain evolved using a breadth of different methods.

The findings emerge in a world enraptured by artificial forms of intelligence, and they could teach us something about how complex circuits in our own brains evolved. Perhaps most importantly, they could help us step “away from the idea that we are the best creatures in the world,” said Niklas Kempynck, a graduate student at KU Leuven who led one of the studies. “We are not this optimal solution to intelligence.”

Birds got there too, on their own.

For the first half of the 20th century, neuroanatomists assumed that birds were simply not that smart. The creatures lack anything resembling a neocortex—the highly ordered outermost structure in the brains of humans and other mammals where language, communication, and reasoning reside. The neocortex is organized into six layers of neurons, which receive sensory information from other parts of the brain, process it, and send it out to regions that determine our behavior and reactions.

In the 1960s, the neuroanatomist Harvey Karten's research into avian neural circuits changed how the field viewed bird intelligence.

“For the longest time, it was thought that this is the center of cognition, and you need this kind of anatomy to develop advanced cognitive abilities,” said Bastienne Zaremba, a postdoctoral researcher studying the evolution of the brain at Heidelberg University.

Rather than neat layers, birds have “unspecified balls of neurons without landmarks or distinctions,” said Fernando García-Moreno, a neurobiologist at the Achucarro Basque Center for Neuroscience in Spain. These structures compelled neuroanatomists a century ago to suggest that much of bird behavior is reflexive, and not driven by learning and decision-making. This “implies that what a mammal can learn easily, a bird will never learn,” Güntürkün said.

The conventional thinking started to change in the 1960s when Harvey Karten, a young neuroanatomist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, mapped and compared brain circuits in mammals and pigeons, and later in owls, chickens, and other birds. What he found was a surprise: The brain regions thought to be involved only in reflexive movements were built from neural circuits—networks of interconnected neurons—that resembled those found in the mammalian neocortex. This region in the bird brain, the dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR), seemed to be comparable to a neocortex; it just didn't look like it.

In 1969, Karten wrote a “very influential paper that completely changed the discussion in the field,” said Maria Tosches, who studies vertebrate brain development at Columbia University. “His work was really revolutionary.” He concluded that because avian and mammalian circuits are similar, they were inherited from a common ancestor. That thinking dominated the field for decades, said Güntürkün, a former postdoc in Karten's lab. It “sparked quite a lot of interest in the bird brain.”

“We are not this optimal solution to intelligence.”

A few decades later, Luis Puelles, an anatomist at the University of Murcia in Spain, drew the opposite conclusion. By comparing embryos at various stages of development, he found that the mammalian neocortex and the avian DVR developed from distinct areas of the embryo's pallium—a brain region shared by all vertebrates. He concluded that the structures must have evolved independently.

Karten and Puelles were “giving completely different answers to this big question,” Tosches said. The debate continued for decades. During this time, biologists also began to appreciate bird intelligence, starting with their studies of Alex, an African gray parrot who could count and identify objects. They realized just how smart birds could be.

However, neither group seemed to want to resolve the discrepancy between their two theories of how vertebrate palliums evolved, according to García-Moreno. “No, they kept working on their own method,” he said. One camp continued to compare the circuitry in adult vertebrate brains; the other focused on embryonic development.

In the new studies, he said, “we tried to put everything together.”

Two new studies, which were conducted by independent teams of researchers, relied on the same powerful tool for identifying cell types, known as single-cell RNA sequencing. This technique lets researchers compare neuronal circuits, as Karten did, not only in adult brains but all the way through embryonic development, following Puelles. In this way, they could see where the cells started growing in the embryo and where they ended up in the mature animal—a developmental journey that can reveal evolutionary pathways.

For their study, García-Moreno and his team wanted to watch how brain circuitry develops. Using RNA sequencing and other techniques, they tracked cells in the palliums of chickens, mice, and geckos at various embryonic stages to time-stamp when different types of neurons were generated and where they matured.

They found that the mature circuits looked remarkably alike across animals, just as Karten and others had noted, but they were built differently, as Puelles had found. The circuits that composed the mammalian neocortex and the avian DVR developed at different times, in different orders, and in different regions of the brain.

At the same time, García-Moreno was collaborating with Zaremba and her colleagues at Heidelberg University. Using RNA sequencing, they created “the most comprehensive atlas of the bird pallium that we have,” said Tosches, who wrote a related perspective piece published in Science. By comparing the bird pallium to lizard and mouse palliums, they also found that the neocortex and DVR were built with similar circuitry—however, the neurons that composed those neural circuits were distinct.

“How we end up with similar circuitry was more flexible than I would have expected,” Zaremba said. “You can build the same circuits from different cell types.”

Zaremba and her team also found that in the bird pallium, neurons that start development in different regions can mature into the same type of neuron in the adult. This pushed against previous views, which held that distinct regions of the embryo must generate different types of neurons.

There's limited degrees of freedom into which you can generate an intelligent brain, at least within vertebrates.

In mammals, brain development follows an intuitive path: The cells in the embryo's amygdala region at the start of development end up in the adult amygdala. The cells in the embryo's cortex region end up in the adult cortex. But in birds, “there is a fantastic reorganization of the forebrain,” Güntürkün said, that is “nothing that we had expected.”

Taken together, the studies provide the clearest evidence yet that birds and mammals independently evolved brain regions for complex cognition. They also echo previous research from Tosches' lab, which found that the mammalian neocortex evolved independently from the reptile DVR.

Still, it seems likely there was some inheritance from a common ancestor. In a third study that used deep learning, Kempynck and his coauthor Nikolai Hecker found that mice, chickens, and humans share some stretches of DNA that influence the development of the neocortex or DVR, suggesting that similar genetic tools are at work in both types of animals. And as previous studies had suggested, the research groups found that inhibitory neurons, or those that silence and modulate neural signals, were conserved across birds and mammals.

The findings haven't completely resolved Karten and Puelles' debate, however. Whose ideas were closer to the truth? Tosches said that Puelles was right, while Güntürkün thought the findings better reflect Karten's ideas, though would partly please Puelles. García-Moreno split the difference: “Both of them were right; none of them was wrong,” he said.

Intelligence doesn't come with an instruction manual. It is hard to define, there are no ideal steps toward it, and it doesn't have an optimal design, Tosches said. Innovations can happen throughout an animal's biology, whether in new genes and their regulation, or in new neuron types, circuits, and brain regions. But similar innovations can evolve multiple times independently—a phenomenon known as convergent evolution—and this is seen across life.

“One of the reasons I kind of like these papers is that they really highlight a lot of differences,” said Bradley Colquitt, a molecular neuroscientist at UC Santa Cruz. “It allows you to say: What are the different neural solutions that these organisms have come up with to solve similar problems of living in a complex world and being able to adapt in a rapidly changing terrestrial environment?”

Octopuses and squids, independently of mammals, evolved camera-like eyes. Birds, bats and insects all took to the skies on their own. Ancient people in Egypt and South America independently built pyramids—the most structurally efficient shape that will stand the test of time, García-Moreno said: “If they make a tower, it will fall. If they make a wall, it won't work.”

Similarly, “there's limited degrees of freedom into which you can generate an intelligent brain, at least within vertebrates,” Tosches said. Drift outside the realm of vertebrates, however, and you can generate an intelligent brain in much weirder ways—from our perspective, anyway. “It's a Wild West,” she said. Octopuses, for example, “evolved intelligence in a way that's completely independent.” Their cognitive structures look nothing like ours, except that they're built from the same broad type of cell: the neuron. Yet octopuses have been caught performing incredible feats such as escaping aquarium tanks, solving puzzles, unscrewing jar lids and carrying shells as shields.

It would be exciting to figure out how octopuses evolved intelligence using really divergent neural structures, Colquitt said. That way, it might be possible to pinpoint any absolute constraints on evolving intelligence across all animal species, not just vertebrates.

Such findings could eventually reveal shared features of various intelligences, Zaremba said. What are the building blocks of a brain that can think critically, use tools, or form abstract ideas? That understanding could help in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence—and help improve our artificial intelligence. For example, the way we currently think about using insights from evolution to improve AI is very anthropocentric. “I would be really curious to see if we can build like artificial intelligence from a bird perspective,” Kempynck said. “How does a bird think? Can we mimic that?”

Making a recent dinner, my wife Elisabeth put together Sohla El-Waylly's “hot and tingly” smashed cucumber salad, a wisp of a recipe that combines favorite ingredients like cukes, chili crisp, salt, sugar, and rice vinegar, along with something less commonly used in our household, MSG. Tucking in, it wasn't a surprise that the salad was good, but the monosodium glutamate gave it an extra savory deliciousness that made me wonder if Elisabeth intentionally set the salad bowl out of my reach.

In my decades living in North America and Europe, MSG was an unfortunately infrequently used ingredient, yet here it was making our tongues happy. Being drawn to it now was inspired by a trend I picked up on while reading some of the best new and recent cookbooks.

Easiest to pick out is the just-released Salt Sugar MSG, by Calvin Eng and Phoebe Melnick, that's a Cantonese-American extravaganza of deliciousness. Tu David Phu and Soleil Ho made regular use of MSG in 2024's The Memory of Taste, and Meathead Goldwyn makes a plea for its use with a special section way up on page five of his brand-new cookbook, The Meathead Method.

Plugging MSG into Eat Your Books, a subscription service that allows you to search recipes from within your own cookbook collection, I could see that among my cookbooks, El-Waylly makes great use of it in her 2023 James Beard Award book, Start Here. Helen Graves has a recipe for an MSG martini in her BBQ Days, BBQ Nights, along with a warning that—I'll paraphrase—you'll likely get hammered if you have more than one of them.

Salt Sugar MSG, By Calvin Eng with Phoebe Melnick. Buy it at Amazon ($29), Bookshop.org ($35), or Powell's ($38)

If I searched Eat Your Books for MSG but took out the results from these books, the list dried up to almost nothing. That's a shame considering what great work the ingredient does in the kitchen. El-Waylly uses it in that cucumber salad, a cauliflower and coconut soup, and a cool pistachio ranch fun dip made fun because she loves ranch. Meathead likes it on chicken, mac and cheese, and meat in general. Tu David Fu uses it with stir-fried clams, sticky rice dumplings, and tomato-braised salmon belly. Calvin Eng uses it on just about everything.

""I keep salt, sugar, MSG on my counter all the time,"" says Eng who's such a fan that he has a little MSG heart tattoo on the back of his left arm.

A self-professed ""lover and user of MSG on a massive scale,"" he still has aha moments with it that help him appreciate its power. His favorite example is Cantonese chicken broth with scallions, garlic, ginger, and Shaoxing wine, finished with salt and MSG. Once for a private dinner, he featured a head-to-head tasting of the broth with salt next to broth with salt and MSG and was deeply impressed at the difference.

""It adds so much umami,"" he says, referring to the savory ""fifth taste"" that accompanies salt, sweet, sour, and bitter. ""It adds a layer. It makes you want more."" Indeed, I tried little head-to-heads with mugs of my own broth and enjoyed getting a hang of its effects and how to use it. Salt adds depth, but salt and MSG can make broth bigger, deeper, rounder, and more delicious.

Seasoning with MSG takes practice. Eng mentions that he didn't fully understand it until he worked in restaurant kitchens, but offers a simple suggestion on how to get used to using it.

""Have it on your counter next to your salt,"" he counsels. “Use both, but use less salt than you normally would, and taste as you go.”

MSG is derived from glutamic acid (one of the amino acids) and is naturally occurring in delicious, umami-packed foods like anchovies, parmesan, tomatoes, and kelp.

When I asked chef turned food scientist, author, and fermentation expert David Zilber about how MSG makes things so delicious, he responded with his own question: ""Shall I put this in Cheeto terms for you?""

My response was an emphatic yes.

""Glutamate is one of the most abundant amino acids in the living world. When you take it out of its natural context and add it to other foods in large quantities, it gets you to eat more,"" he explains. ""They are like the signals in nature that the human body looks for when searching for the most digestible and nutritious foods. It hacks ancient and primal physiology to make bland foods more palatable and moreish.""

Perhaps this makes my whole ritual of keeping a damp cloth next to my snack-touching hand on my annual (?) Cheeto binge make more sense.

Cravings are certainly affected by what we do and don't like, Zilber explains, ""but at the chemical level, smell and taste are the most ‘hands in the dirt' senses our body has.""

For as helpful as it is for making food better, the ingredient has had a tough go of it in North America. MSG ""is derived from glutamic acid, one of the 22 amino acids,"" says my 2007 copy of The Food Lover's Companion, which calls the ingredient a popular flavor enhancer in Japan and China.

It also says ""some people have reactions to MSG that caused them to suffer from a variety of maladies, including dizziness, headache, flushing, and burning sensations,"" information that is, like my copy, dated. This stems from a 1968 letter from Robert Ho Man Kwok printed in the New England Journal of Medicine, citing symptoms like dizziness, headache, and nausea that were dubbed “Chinese restaurant syndrome” and prompted many Chinatown restaurants around the world to hang glowing neon “NO MSG” signs on their front windows.

Problematically, it appears that either Kwok's story was more anecdotal than science-based or an orthopedic surgeon named Howard Steel penned the letter as part of a $10 bet with a colleague to see if he could get it published in a prestigious medical journal. Regardless, the Journal never made enough of an effort to correct things as they spiraled into a problem and a faux syndrome was born. (More on this in act one of this April 2025 episode of This American Life.)

Stuff like this makes for yarns that would be a lot more enjoyable if they didn't trail a 50-year xenophobic stink in their wake, and the ""MSG is bad for you"" stereotype persists. Too much of it can be harmful to you if you're ingesting ridiculous quantities. As El-Waylly writes, “If you have 1/2 cup of it on an empty stomach without food, you might feel ill, as you would from eating 1/2 cup of salt.” The dose makes the poison.

Eng's solution for promoting MSG, and one he encourages other chefs and food professionals to mimic, is right there on the cover of his book: Talk about it. Normalize it. Try it out.

Personally, I grabbed the aforementioned books and started cooking from them. Along with the hot and tingly cuke salad, El-Wally's dill pickle cucumber salad with pickle brine, onions, and toasted coriander seeds is another great place to start, and something that nearly set off a dinnertime squabble over who got the last bowl at a Ray-family meal. I tried Eng's popcorn recipe, which also features a dusting of toasted Szechuan peppercorns, fried garlic, MSG, and melted butter. I riffed on his sour cream and green onion dip, making mine with caramelized onions, then showering it with chives from my garden, quick-pickled onions, black pepper, and crumbled store-bought fried onions.

Not long afterward, I made a rather exquisite bagel with butter, cream cheese, smoked salmon, shallot, scallion, salt, pepper, and MSG. It's hard for something with ingredients this fantastic not to be delicious, but I started thinking that the MSG turned them all into the best versions of themselves.

There's a ways to go before MSG is anywhere near as mainstream as salt, but until then, I invite you to join me on the Normalization Team and, like Eng suggests, keep a container of it on the counter, right next to the salt.

OpenAI is currently in “a tough negotiation” with one of its biggest investors and partners, Microsoft, according to the Financial Times.

The AI startup recently announced a major change to its corporate restructuring plans — while it still aims to convert its business arm into a for-profit public benefit corporation, its nonprofit board will remain in control.

The FT says it spoke to multiple sources who describe Microsoft, which has invested $13 billion in OpenAI to date, as a key holdout needed to approve the restructuring.

While the crux of the negotiation is how much equity Microsoft will receive in the new for-profit entity, the companies are also reportedly renegotiating their broader contract, with Microsoft offering to give up some of its equity in exchange for access to OpenAI technology developed after the current 2030 cutoff.

Sources also told the FT that these negotiations are complicated by the increasingly competitive relationship between the two companies, as OpenAI's enterprise business has grown and as it pursues its wildly ambitious Stargate infrastructure project.

Whoop has backed down, somewhat, from the controversial upgrade plans around its Whoop 5.0 fitness tracker.

When the company first announced Whoop 5.0 this week, it said members who wanted the new device could either extend their subscriptions by 12 months or pay a one-time upgrade fee of $49 ($79 for the model with EKG sensors).

This seemed inconsistent with Whoop's overall value proposition, where it charges higher subscription prices (ranging $199 to $359 a year) while allowing customers to upgrade their hardware for free. More specifically, it seemed to contradict a statement on the company's website promising users free hardware upgrades if they've been members for at least six months.

After customers began complaining, the company responded with a Reddit post both announcing a more expansive upgrade policy and claiming to clarify its overall approach.

Now, anyone with more than 12 months remaining on their subscription is eligible for a free upgrade to Whoop 5.0 (or a refund if they've already paid the fee). And customers with less than 12 months can extend their subscription to get the upgrade at no additional cost.

While the company said it's making these changes because it “heard your feedback,” it also suggested that its apparent stinginess was tied to its transition from a model focused on monthly or six-month subscription plans to one where it only offers 12- and 24-month subscriptions.

“We also want to acknowledge that a previous blog article incorrectly stated that anyone who had been a member for just 6 months would receive a free upgrade,” the company said. “This was never our policy and should never have been posted.”

There's been a mixed response to these changes on the Whoop subreddit, with one moderator describing it as a “win for the community.” Other posters were more skeptical, with one writing, “You don't publish a policy by accident and keep it up for years. Removing it after backlash doesn't erase the fact [that] it is real.”

There were also a number of complaints from users who said they had 11 months left on their subscriptions, so they just missed the free upgrade cutoff.

The mobile controller company Backbone unveiled its Backbone Pro controller this week, which brings iOS and Android gaming experiences to the next level.

A successor to the Backbone One controller, the Pro features full-size joysticks, re-mappable buttons, and Bluetooth compatibility, making for a more premium gaming setup. Unlike its predecessor, the Backbone Pro doesn't need to be attached to a phone to work, meaning that you could use it as a wireless controller. That functionality gets extra useful when using cloud gaming services like Xbox Game Pass. You can play a game with the Backbone Pro controller on your TV, then plug your phone into the controller and instantly pick up where you left off on mobile.

“Our thought is, gaming should be a lot more straightforward,” founder Maneet Khaira told TechCrunch. ”It needs to be really simple and work more like AirPods when you connect to screens.”

Backbone is betting big on the growth of mobile gaming, which has only been accelerated by expanding cloud gaming options, but so far, Backbone seems to be cementing itself as the top hardware maker for mobile gamers. It also helps that Backbone is teeming with celebrity investors like Ashton Kutcher, The Weeknd, MrBeast, Post Malone, and Amy Schumer, as well as gaming insiders like Discord founder Jason Citron.

But as someone who doesn't use Xbox Game Pass or similar cloud subscriptions, I never quite understood the hype around using a smartphone as a gaming device. I already have a Nintendo Switch, a device specifically made for gaming, as opposed to my iPhone, which is designed for a bazillion other things. So to test the Backbone Pro, I downloaded some games on my phone that I already play on the Switch, solely for the purpose of comparing the gameplay experience.

The verdict? I have logged about 13 hours of gameplay on the iOS version of Stardew Valley over the last three days. I'm not fully sold on mobile gaming — answering texts while playing a game is kind of annoying — but I have to say, I'd much rather sit on the couch with the Backbone Pro than the Nintendo Switch, which prioritizes screen size over comfort.

The Backbone Pro shines in its ergonomics. Sometimes, when you pick up a new iPhone, it feels familiar, yet slightly off, and it takes some time to get used to the feel of the new device before the differences stop being noticeable. This was the experience I had playing the Nintendo Switch 2, as opposed to the original console.

But the Backbone Pro's design feels so naturally intuitive that I didn't even experience those few minutes of discomfort. Seconds after plugging my phone into the controller's USB-C port for the first time, I could play Hades — a game rife with chaotic button mashing — just as easily as I do on the Switch. I find the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller uncomfortable for games like Hades, so that's saying something.

“Meta, when they were designing the Quest, they would do multiple iterations of a headset [prototype] in a week, because they could print them and then rapidly test them, get feedback, and iterate,” Khaira said. He took inspiration from that technique when developing the Backbone Pro, investing heavily in the same kind of technology.

Backbone 3D-printed over 9,000 different parts before landing on the model that ultimately shipped, making microscopic tweaks to every facet of the controller before arriving at something that makes Joy-Cons feel like Fisher-Price toys.

This level of precision and versatility comes at a cost. The Backbone Pro retails for $169.99, which is a bit steep considering that you could buy a refurbished Nintendo Switch Lite for the same price. But for serious players who need that cross-device functionality, the Backbone Pro could be worth it. 

If you're not moving back and forth between Xbox Game Pass on your TV and your phone, you could probably be fine with the original Backbone One, which is $99.99.

Much of the world isn't paying close attention to Greece right now. That may be a mistake. Best known for its stunning islands, sun-soaked cities, and deep historical roots, Greece has been quietly laying the foundation for something less expected — a modern, resilient tech economy.

While the international spotlight often misses it, something real is happening on the ground, as this editor discovered this week across dozens of conversations in Athens. The country that once stood at the precipice of economic collapse hasn't merely rebranded itself as an “Innovation Nation.” It's turning clever marketing into reality, with policy shifts, investor interest, and a renewed sense of purpose around tech and entrepreneurship.

Indeed, in a sit-down Thursday night with Greece Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, he made the case to TechCrunch that Greece isn't just catching up but poised to surprise. “There is significant room to grow,” he conceded, but “the stars are aligned.”

It didn't happen without effort. Greece, Mitsotakis explained, made a “conscious decision” half a dozen years ago to expand beyond its traditional economic strengths like tourism and hospitality. “Tech could be 10% of our economy. This is perfectly doable,” he said, citing rising startup formation, increased capital flows, and an energized and growing base of founders and VCs in the ecosystem. Drawing from his own background in venture capital — he founded Greece's first incubator in 2001 — he spoke with a fluency not often heard from heads of state.

While Greece may be arriving late to Europe's tech party, that timing could actually prove to be an advantage. Because it didn't have the capital to make bad bets, Greece has sidestepped some of the inflated valuations and failed ventures that are weighing down more mature ecosystems. With a relatively clean slate, the country is moving quickly to seize on emerging technologies – particularly artificial intelligence.

Thanks to AI, in fact, the Prime Minister sees a chance to potentially skip ahead. “We want to use technology to leapfrog,” he said. “Not just to catch up, but to actually do better than many European countries.” He pointed to Greece's success in digitizing public services – saying it had far exceeded even Germany in some respects – and to pilot programs like a Microsoft-backed AI system that slashed government contract review times from hours to minutes.

That dual strategy of nurturing startups while modernizing government forms the backbone of Greece's AI ambitions. Mitsotakis envisions Greece as a laboratory for responsible innovation, particularly in areas like health, civil protection, and defense. “We're not just talking about what the startup community is doing. We are the clients of the technologies. And we want to have more of a startup mentality as a government.”

A critical ingredient of this transformation is talent. Greece is working to reverse the brain drain that saw thousands of skilled workers leave during the financial crisis. “The tax breaks are there — a 50% discount on income tax for seven years,” he said. But he also acknowledged that “people are not going to come back just for a tax break. They will come back if they have a good job opportunity, if they feel they can do something rewarding and they can actually grow their business in Greece.”

To that end, in our conversation, we touched on recent changes to Greece's “Golden Visa” program that now grants a residence permit to third-country nationals who invest a minimum of €250,000 in a Greek start-up registered on the Greek National Startup Registry; we also talked about two new programs introduced last year designed to bring skilled foreign workers and entrepreneurs into the country. (While the last initiatives are still in the pipeline, they seem to reflect a broader commitment to openness.) “This is a global war for talent,” Mitsotakis said. “We need to make it easy for either Greek talent to return or for people who can live anywhere to choose to work here.”

Mitsotakis also emphasized the importance of expanding tech beyond Athens, with hubs emerging in Thessaloniki, Heraklion, and other university cities. “This should also be a story about regional development.”

Still, the Prime Minister acknowledged ongoing challenges, including the dizzying pace of legal reform, the need for more late-stage capital, and the complexities of doing business across the European market. But what he believes Greece now offers, unlike during the depths of the crisis, is predictability, stability, and momentum. “Is this country moving in the right direction?” he asked rhetorically. “The answer is yes.”

For Mitsotakis, the ultimate goal is to make Greece's progress “irreversible.” While legacy building isn't his focus, he said, both Mitsotakis and the roughly 300 investors and founders who gathered for our sit-down — some of whom have happily moved back to Greece from the Bay Area, London and elsewhere — clearly want to ensure that the country's progress continues apace.

“We can't [perform] miracles,” said Mitsotakis. “We can't make up lost ground in a couple of years. But I think we've broken out of the vicious cycle of the past, and I do see technology as a great opportunity, both for the private sector and for the government.”

You can catch our full interview with Mitsotakis below.

The tech industry seems to have two thoughts when it comes to where human workers fit into the AI-powered world they are creating: Either they think that all the jobs, except perhaps their own, will be done by bots. (VC Marc Andreessen seems to think that his work as an investor could never be automated). 

Or they think that bots will do the icky, boring work, acting as human companions in jobs while humans do brand-new jobs that the bot revolution creates. The latter is the one most supported by historical evidence. The World Economic Forum predicts that 92 million roles will be displaced by current technological trends, but that 170 million new jobs will be created.

For those who don't have the economic power, or the intellectual interest, to get a master's degree in AI and machine learning — especially the people who now occupy unskilled labor roles like warehouse workers — what does the bot-filled future look like for them?

Amazon offered a hint of one sort of path on Wednesday when it announced major progress toward replacing warehouse workers with robots with its new Vulcan robot that can “feel.”

“Vulcan is helping make work safer by handling ergonomically challenging tasks, while creating opportunities for our teammates to grow their skills in robotics maintenance,” CEO Andy Jassy posted on X. 

In one breath, Amazon's blog post about Vulcan described how the robot will work alongside humans, gathering items from the warehouse's highest and lowest shelves, so humans won't have to climb ladders or bend down all day long. Humans will then gather items stored only in the middle and/or items that the new “feeling” robot still somehow can't manage to pick up.

In the next breath, Amazon talks about how it is training a small number of warehouse workers to become robot technicians, as it uses the bot for more of the warehouse picking role. 

“These robots — which play a role in completing 75% of customer orders — have created hundreds of new categories of jobs at Amazon, from robotic floor monitors to onsite reliability maintenance engineers,” the blog post said, adding that it offers a job retraining program for some workers to gain these robotic maintenance skills.

Although Amazon didn't say so, this would obviously not be a 1:1 conversion. It wouldn't require an army of humans to oversee the robots in the same way it needs them to fulfill warehouse orders directly. Nor would everyone have the aptitude or desire to become robot mechanics.

But the fact that Amazon included info on its retraining program alongside its Vulcan announcement is meaningful. 

That's because there's been very little evidence so far of what the post robots-doing-all-the-jobs looks like for working-class humans. (One AI startup founder even suggested to TechCrunch that in an AI-does-all-jobs world, the humans would somehow just live on government-issued welfare.)

But perhaps, instead of grocery clerks, there would be “automation monitors,” much like we have one clerk overseeing every row of self-check today. Instead of fast-food cooks, workers would oversee the cook bots, and so on. Running robots becomes like operating a PC: Pretty much everyone needs to know how to do it to be employable.

Then again, this fully bot future may never really materialize. Bots could remain the purview of only the biggest and most deep-pocketed companies — like with Amazon or how they're used in things like automotive manufacturing — while the vast majority of retail, restaurants, and driving jobs continue to be done by humans. At least for decades more.

Remember, Amazon is a company that was trying to sell its just-walk-out automation Amazon Go technology to a wider retail/grocery industry. The retail industry is none too fond of its biggest competitor, Amazon, and wasn't terribly interested. The tech was later found to be using humans in India to watch and label videos, and even Amazon later scaled back on its use. Such tech (by Amazon or others) is hardly visible in the wild today.

Apple is famous for its tight control over pricing, especially on new products. If a deal on a brand-new Apple product is what you're looking for, you usually have to look beyond the official Apple Store.

This is why we think it's really exceptional that the iPad 2025 is now discounted at Amazon: You can buy the newest 128GB Wi-Fi iPad for just $299, which is a full $50 off its $349 introduction price. Make sure you grab yours before it runs out of stock, as over 10,000 units have already been sold in the past few days.

See at Amazon

The 11th-generation iPad has been introduced in March 2025 and it is a major leap in Apple's affordable tablet line. Powering it is the A16 Bionic chip, it gives this iPad a huge performance and efficiency boost compared to the last generation. The A16 features a 5-core CPU, a 4-core GPU and 16-core Neural Engine, more than enough to handle intensive apps, multitasking and creative workflows. Paired with 6GB of RAM (and 128GB storage), the iPad 11 delivers a smooth user experience whether you're streaming or gaming.

The screen is a standout in itself, and this is why iPads are so popular: an 11-inch Liquid Retina display with a 2360 x 1640 pixel resolution at 264 ppi with sharp images, deep color and excellent viewing angles. True Tone technology adjusts the color temperature of the display to your environment and 500 nits of brightness make the screen readable and clear even in direct sunlight.

For video calling or photography users, the iPad 11 has a 12MP rear camera with autofocus, Smart HDR 4, and 4K video recording and a 12MP front camera with Center Stage to keep you constantly in frame in video calls. Both cameras come with advanced features like cinematic video stabilization and extended dynamic range. You can use this iPad as a productivity and business tool super easily. With up to all-day battery life, you can count on the iPad 11 to get you through work or a vacation.

Apple's reputation for rarely discounting its devices is true, and this Amazon deal is as one of the best opportunities to get the latest iPad at a reduced price.

If you've been waiting for the “perfect” moment to upgrade your home lighting, now is the time: Govee's Smart RGBIC Floor Lamp is currently at its lowest price ever on Amazon. It just dropped to $64 which is a massive 35% savings from its usual $99. This is a very rare opportunity, as Govee (which is the undisputed reference in smart lighting) seldom offers discounts outside of major events like Prime Day or Black Friday.

See at Amazon

The RGBIC Floor Lamp is a great example of why Govee is so popular: Despite its high-tech credentials, this lamp is very simple to use. The setup is quite straightforward: you just have to assemble the lamp, plug it in, and connect it to your Wi-Fi. From there, you can control everything using voice commands through Alexa or Google Assistant or with the intuitive Govee Home app. Switching colors, brightness, or switching between dynamic scenes takes seconds, making it simple even for smart home beginners.

What is unique about this lamp is the way it succeeds in changing the mood of any room without ever appearing kitsch or out of context: The low-profile, matte black, premium and minimalist design blends in with contemporary decor. It is not a gadget but a proper decorative item that adds to the beauty of your living room, bedroom or gaming room. The lamp's 1000-lumen output is bright enough for daily use, and its RGBIC technology (which you can customize) allows it to display multiple colors at once for effects that are absolutely unique.

With 16 million color support and 58 pre-set scene modes, you can tailor the ambiance to suit any mood or occasion. The DIY mode in the app enables you to create your own color combination and the music sync feature takes immersion to a whole new level-the lamp reacts in real time to your favorite music or movie, making every moment more vibrant and engaging. It's an easy way to add personality and energy to your home.

Govee's reputation for quality and the improbability of such a deep discount make this deal especially interesting. Amazon is the only retailer which offers such discounts on this premium brand, and you should make sure to get yours before it runs out of stock.

The Mighty Morhpin era of the Power Rangers casts a long shadow over the whole franchise, and its casting in particular. Controversial and infamous as it's been to have the Black and Yellow Rangers played respectively by Black actor Walter Jones III and the late Asian actor Thuy Trang, their roles as Zack and Trini proved foundational for a lot of viewers. Trini officially died prior to the 2023 special Once and Always, but the character is returning again as the lead in an upcoming novel.

Written by Diana Ma (Heiress Apparently), Power Rangers: Force of Chaos explores Trini's POV during the Mighty Morphin team's early days. As the team works through their initial feelings about one another, including Trini's own “complicated history” with Zack, the book will delve into her Chinese heritage and being a martial artist superhero. Ma, in a statement to Polygon (which also has an excerpt), teased the book would “bring Chinese mythology” and let her show her love for the character she grew up watching.

“Trini was important to me because she was one of the first Asian-American superheroes I saw on TV,” said Ma. “As a Chinese American superhero-loving fangirl, it was powerful for me to see this representation in a kids' TV show. Knowing that Power Ranger fans were watching and connecting to Trini as she kicked Putty butt as part of a superhero team committed to protecting the universe made me feel seen.”



Power Rangers: Force of Chaos releases this Tuesday, May 13.

It's easy to get caught up in the hype of the latest OLED TVs with their stunning visuals and price tags that soar well above $1,000 But for most consumers, you don't require all the frills to get excellent picture quality and smart functionality. There are affordable alternatives that deliver good performance without paying an arm and a leg, and the VIZIO 40″ 1080p Smart TV is one of these.

This model is a proof that it's possible to get a good, feature-rich TV for a fraction of what high-end models cost. Better still, this TV is currently available for just $138 at Amazon, a price that not only is below its normal $169 price but which is also below its Black Friday sale price of $149.

See at Amazon

Despite its low cost, the VIZIO Smart TV doesn't skimp on features or performance: It has a 40-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) display so you will get clear, high-definition images and it will be ideal for bedrooms, small living rooms, or even as a secondary gaming or streaming TV. The TV features a Full Array LED backlighting for a uniform illumination and vibrant colors across the entire screen. It is HDR10 and HLG high dynamic range enabled which releases more detail in light and dark imagery and makes your movies, TV programs, and games look more real.

Driven by Vizio's pretty good SmartCast platform, it gives instant access to all the major streaming apps, including Netflix, Disney+, YouTube, Prime Video and Apple TV+. Navigation is responsive and fluid thanks to the recent software updates that have optimized performance and simplicity. With built-in Chromecast and Apple AirPlay 2, you can project content directly from your phone, tablet, or laptop, making sharing photos, videos, or even screen mirroring a snap. The TV is also Alexa and Google Assistant voice remote control compatible.

Gamers will appreciate the V-Gaming Engine which enhances contrast and color for better gaming and keeps input lag under 10ms at 1080p/60Hz. Two HDMI 1.4 inputs are included to connect consoles or streaming devices, a USB input for media playback, and digital audio output to connect soundbars or home theater systems.

If you're looking for a solid, high-feature smart TV at a price that's hard to beat, this VIZIO model is one of the best deals you'll get on Amazon.

Pap smears are a vital tool for preventing cervical cancer because they can detect cell abnormalities before they become cancerous. Unfortunately, systematic barriers or a lack of comfort with the procedure means many people aren't receiving it. But on Friday, the FDA approved the first at-home test for cervical cancer screenings that is a less invasive and potentially more accessible alternative to pap smears.

The newly FDA-approved test was developed by San Francisco-based startup Teal Health. Like traditional pap smears, Teal Health tests for the human papillomavirus or HPV, which causes virtually all cervical cancers. However, it's test, the Teal Wand, only requires a vaginal swab with a spongelike tool instead of inserting a speculum to scrape cells from the cervix.

In a statement, Kara Egan, CEO and co-founder of Teal Health, said that the approval isn't “just about an innovative product — it's about finally giving women an option that makes sense for their lives — something that can be done quickly and comfortably at home.”

“Because when we make care easier to get, we help women stay healthy, for themselves and for the people who rely on them every day,” Egan continued.

In the United States, about 11,500 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year, and 4,000 people will die of it. However, cervical cancer could be “eradicate[d] in our lifetime,” Dr. Alexi Wright, the director of gynecologic oncology outcomes research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, told the New York Times. “We have the tools to do it. We just don't have comprehensive HPV vaccination or cervical cancer screening, and often can't reach the people who are at highest risk.”

According to the American Cancer Society, cervical cancer deaths in the U.S. have dropped by over half since the mid-1970s, although it has leveled off recently. One 2022 study found that 23% of people were behind on their screenings in 2019 compared to 14% in 2005. Although reasons vary, one study found that lack of insurance and cost were common factors. In addition, cervical cancer rates are 25% higher in rural areas, and the death rate is 42% higher, likely due to a lack of resources and health care providers. For some, discomfort is also a big barrier. In 2023, many participants in a Michigan Medicine study said that at-home kits “provide a comfortable, convenient, and flexible choice without trauma.”

At-home screenings are effective alternatives for closing the screening gap. One study found that mailing kits to people overdue for cervical cancer screenings saw a 50% increase compared to offering usual care alone. In addition, they are just as accurate as clinical tests. (Teal Health also has a SELF-CERV study.)

Teal Health plans to make kits available next month, starting in California. The company is also coordinating with major insurance providers in the hope of covering costs. In addition to requesting tests through Teal Health's platform, people can coordinate follow-up care through it if necessary.

If you've ever found yourself frustrated by the lack of ports on your laptop (whether you use a Mac or a PC), you're not alone.

And right now, it's available on Amazon at a record low price of just $21, down from $34 which is a massive 37% discount that makes it almost impossible to pass up.

If you could beat Fugaku at the Nico Nico Super Conference you could do what you want with it for a whole day.

The Fugaku supercomputer was again one of the unlikely stars of the recent Nico Nico Super Conference in Japan. In a re-run of last year, Fugaku was the brains behind the ‘Super Keisan Battle' competition, where humans ritually humiliate themselves in a calculation race with a petascale supercomputer. Up for grabs was a free full day to utilize Fugaku however you might want, a ‘Fugaku One-Day Unlimited Ticket.' However, the competition page contains an admission that this is a game “that no one can win” against Fugaku (machine translation).

🎉#ニコニコ超会議202510秒間でどれだけ足し算ができるか?!＼スーパーコンピュータ「#富岳」と対決！けいさんバトル🧮／「富岳」に勝ったら豪華賞品🎟️✨負けても残念賞としてミニチュア「富岳」を1つプレゼント🎁😉#超富岳🗻ブース (HALL4-B48)で挑戦してね🤗https://t.co/Yg3XaXKwEu pic.twitter.com/B7eDQuuu88April 26, 2025

The Fugaku Face Off is pretty simple, and kind of stacks things even more in the supercomputer's favor. According to the instructions we saw, a competition entrant must solve as many numerical additions as possible in 10 seconds. Most seemed to achieve 10 or 11, but Tomooo_108, for example, managed to solve 13 sums in the allotted time. This pales into insignificance vs the supercomputer, though. Fugaku managed to complete 442,010,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 sums during the 10 second battle. That's four sextillion four hundred twenty quintillion one hundred quadrillion calculations.

Competitors mostly found the scale of their defeat against Fugaku quite amusing, in social media comments we have seen. Some joked that if you could beat Fugaku, you wouldn't need to use it for the free day. Others pondered over the cosmic collapse that would occur if a human could move a pen fast enough to record four sextillion sums in 10 seconds. Good news - even if you lost against Fugaku, there were consolation prizes such as a miniature Fugaku to take home (expand the Tweet embedded above to see them).

At the Nico Nico Super Conference, which seems to be dominated by tech entertainment phenomena (e.g. VTubers and Cosplay), the Fugaku Face Off is another fun diversion, but with a serious twist. The supercomputer makers remind entrants that Fugaku, and its brethren, are used for tasks like research on disaster prevention – flood damage simulation, optimal evacuation plans, and so on.

Fugaku, currently ranked sixth place in the TOP500 supercomputer list, delivers 442 PFlop/s of compute. It wields 158,976 nodes (each powered by a Fujitsu A64FX (48+4 core) microprocessor), packs 4.85 PiB RAM, and runs a custom Linux kernel.

The last time we reported on Fugaku, was a story largely about its successor. The collaborative work between RIKEN and Fujitsu should start this year and the goal is to deliver a ZetaFLOPS-scale supercomputer by 2030.

In the annals of the RTX 40 generation, the RTX Titan Ada reigned as the elusive and mysterious Bigfoot of its time. Various sources unearthed prototypes of this GPU, though Nvidia never released this beast for the mainstream. Roman 'Der8auer' Hartung has now managed to secure a prototype of this card, and in a new video, the overclocking expert showcased its capabilities across various games and synthetics, revealing what could have been.

Nvidia's Titan-class GPUs occupied a unique space among enthusiasts, outfitted with the fastest dies and configurations of their respective generation. While being powerhouses for workstations, they also managed to beat their consumer equivalents in gaming as well. The Titan RTX, revealed in 2018, was the last of its kind and these GPUs have since been superseded by Nvidia's 90-class GPUs: RTX 3090, RTX 4090, and RTX 5090.

The prototype carries a massive quad-slot cooler design, shadowing even the RTX 4090 Founders Edition. The card's shroud is stamped with the ""Titan"" designation. Der8auer defines it as ""The biggest GPU I've ever held in my hand."" Internally, the PCB has been mounted vertically to the side, as reflected by the I/O ports at the rear. Specifications-wise, we're looking at a fully-enabled AD102 chip with all 144 Streaming Multiprocessors functional, equating to 18,432 CUDA cores, 12.5% more than the RTX 4090. This is complemented by 48GB of G6X memory, achieved by placing 24x 16Gb modules in clamshell mode. We've already seen images of this GPU's PCB previously.

Der8auer says this GPU has a 450W TGP, despite the dual 12V-2x6 design, and that's probably a limitation of the vBIOS used. The driver used dates back to 2023, but the YouTuber didn't provide further details, likely to protect their sources.

In 3DMark Time Spy Extreme, the RTX Titan Ada beats the RTX 4090 by 15% (139.3 vs 121.3), while consuming 14% (443W vs 388W) more power. Meanwhile, the RTX 5090 is 11% faster than the RTX Titan Ada, but consumes 21% more power. Near-linear scaling at this power draw is quite impressive for the Titan Ada. This suggests the GPU still has some performance headroom available and might be able to match the RTX 5090 in some tests if it benefitted from proper vBIOS and driver support.

3DMark Speedway was less impressive, scoring 7% faster than the RTX 4090, with the RTX 5090 ahead by 33%. Remnant 2 at 4K Max sees the Titan Ada pull ahead of the RTX 4090 by 10%, still 14% behind the RTX 5090, but that's still a commendable result. Much of the same story repeats in Cyberpunk 2077. Other games were accompanied by crashes and weird anomalies due to the drivers. In efficiency (FPS per Watt), the Titan Ada beats both the RTX 5090 and the RTX 4090, albeit by a small margin.

Overall, this was an impressive showcase for what could've been the fastest RTX 40 series GPU. Manufacturing costs were likely the primary reason this GPU didn't see the light of day, as there can only be so many perfect AD102 dies (609mm2) with no defects. The RTX Titan Ada was never a practical GPU, considering the workstation-oriented RTX 6000 Ada, which used a partially disabled AD102 chip (142/144 SMs), cost between $7,000 - $10,000. Either the RTX Titan would've been more expensive than this, which is unlikely since the RTX Titan (Turing) launched at $2,500, or it would've hurt Nvidia's workstation GPU sales.

This engineering marvel necessitated custom userspace GPU drivers and probably a patched adapter firmware as well.

External GPU (eGPU) support on Apple Silicon Macs and MacBooks has been a persistent pain point for AI/ML developers. Through what some may consider to be black magic, Tiny Corp has managed to get an AMD eGPU working in Tiny Grad over USB3, a standard that inherently lacks PCIe capabilities. As they're using libusb, this functionality extends to Windows, Linux, and even macOS, including devices with Apple Silicon.

Traditionally, GPUs are connected through PCIe slots or the Thunderbolt/USB4 interfaces, which offer PCI Express tunneling support. As such, external GPU solutions rely on the aforementioned interfaces, which limits their support for older systems and laptops. Unlike Intel-based Macs/MacBooks, Apple Silicon based devices do not support external GPUs, mainly due to the lack of driver support and architectural differences. So, despite their efficiency compared to traditional x86-based systems, users have reported challenges in AI workloads, especially when it comes to prompt processing.

Here's the worlds first AMD GPU driven over USB3. From a Mac! Linux and Windows should work too, it's just libusb.Available today in tinygrad master, use an ADT-UT3G to connect the GPU to your USB port. You have no idea of the level of engineering that went into this. pic.twitter.com/V6trNwcGXtMay 9, 2025

Requirements for running an eGPU through a USB3 interface at this time include the use of an ASM2464PD-based adapter and an AMD GPU. For its tests, Tiny Corp used the ADT-UT3G adapter, which uses the same ASM2464PD chip, but out of the box, it only works with Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB 4 interfaces. The team likely employed a custom firmware to enable USB3 mode that works without direct PCIe communication. Technical details are murky, however, the controller appears to be translating PCIe commands to USB packets and vice versa.

The solution is quite hacky, as it bypasses kernel-level GPU drivers, requires specific hardware, and uses USB3, which was not originally intended for GPU communication. It essentially offloads the computation part, referring to kernel executions, from your system to the eGPU. The constraint here is that data transfer speeds are capped at 10 Gbps due to the USB3 standard used, so loading models into the GPU will take much longer than if you were to use a standard PCIe connection.

Since it uses custom user-space drivers to avoid tinkering with the kernel, the feature is limited to AMD's RDNA 3/4 GPUs, although there's a hint of potential RDNA 2 support in the future. USB3 eGPU functionality has been upstreamed to Tiny Grad's master branch, so if you have an AMD GPU and a supported adapter, feel free to try it out. We can expect Tiny Corp to provide a more detailed and technical breakdown once its developers done tidying up the code.

Jiushark's JF800 Diamond is the strongest performing air cooler we've ever tested, but it's not easy to get in the U.S.

Strongest air cooler we've tested

Chart-topping noise-normalized performance

Nice aesthetics

You'll probably have to import this one via AliExpress

Runs louder than competing coolers


Why you can trust Tom's Hardware




Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.


While Jiushark isn't well known in U.S. enthusiast and PC building circles, we've covered the company in the past, highlighting some of its unique products like the Jiushark M.2 Three, an M.2 SSD cooler that uses a dual heatpipe radiator and fan, much like a mini CPU cooler. We've also tested the JF13K Diamond low-profile CPU cooler.

Today, we're looking at the new Jiushark JF800 Diamond dual-tower air cooler, available in white and black, with the company claiming cooling capabilities of up to 280W!



Will Jiushark's latest make our list of best CPU coolers on the market? There's no question that it deserves a shot because, spoiler, this is the strongest performing dual-tower cooler we've ever tested, on both Intel Raptor Lake and Arrow Lake CPUs. But it's also pretty hard to come by in the U.S., unless you're willing to order it directly from China.

Let's take a look at the specifications and features of the cooler. Then we'll go over thermal performance and noise levels.

Cooler

Opening the compact box reveals the accessories, neatly packaged above the cooler.



Included in the box are the following:



*️⃣ Six copper heatpipes

The Jiushark JF800 Diamond moves heat away from the CPU using six copper heatpipes – but as you'll see in our benchmarks, it offers performance superior to similar air coolers we've tested.



*️⃣ Heatsink Design

The towers of the JF800 feature what appears to be a fairly basic fin design.



The tops of the heatsinks have a grille reminiscent of cattle guards, adding some nice aesthetics with the ARGB lighting shining through them.



*️⃣ Two 120mm fans with ARGB lighting

There's more to a cooler than just the heatsink or radiator. The bundled fans significantly impact cooling and noise levels, as well as how the cooler looks in your case. The included fans here have nine blades, and there are models with or without ARGB lighting, according to your preference.



As you'll see in the benchmarks below, the fans help enable superior thermal performance, but can be a little noisy.

There are many factors other than the CPU cooler that can influence your cooling performance, including the case you use and the fans installed in it. A system's motherboard can also influence this, especially if it suffers from bending, which results in poor cooler contact with the CPU.

To prevent bending from impacting our cooling results, we've installed Thermalright's LGA 1700 contact frame into our testing rig. If your motherboard is affected by bending, your thermal results will be worse than those shown below.

Not all motherboards are affected equally by this issue. I tested Raptor Lake CPUs on two motherboards. And while one showed significant thermal improvements after installing Thermalright's LGA1700 contact frame, the other motherboard showed no temperature diffrence! Check out our review of the contact frame for more information.

I've also tested this cooler with Intel's latest platform, Arrow Lake and the LGA 1851 socket.

CPU

Intel Core Ultra 9 285K

GPU

MSI Ventus 3X RTX 4070Ti Super

Motherboard

MSI Z890 Carbon Wifi

Case

MSI MPG Gungnir 300R

System fans

Pre-installed case fans

The installation of this air cooler is easy with the included mounting hardware.

1. You'll first need to place the backplate against the rear of the motherboard after assembling it.



2. Next, you'll need to take the rubber standoffs and slide them against the poles of the backplate.



3. Then, you'll take the mounting bars and place them on top of the rubber standoffs, securing them with the included screws.



4. Apply the included thermal paste to your CPU. If you have any questions on how to do this properly, please refer to our handy how to apply thermal paste guide.

5. Remove the middle fan from the cooler, then place the cooler on top of your CPU. Use a screwdriver to secure it using the screws in between the two towers, shown below.



6. Once complete, connect the PWM and ARGB cables to the corresponding motherboard headers. Installation is now complete.

Philips announced a new initiative called ""Philips Fixables"" which aims to encourage self-repair on some of its products by offering officially drafted 3D printable replacement components. The files are made available for free over at Printables.com. This is where Philips plans to archive files for more official replacements that can be 3D printed at home.

This is a new idea, so only one component is available right now for download. The piece happens to be a 3mm comb for one of their shavers, but Philips assures there will be more components made available for more of their devices over time. This isn't the release of a grand library of parts by any means, but it does showcase a shift in supporting communities in search of businesses that support repairable hardware.

The program has been primarily released to the Czech Republic. Both Prusa Research and LePub are partnering up to help support the program which they hope will be easily adopted by the local maker community. One of the main goals of Philips Fixables is to encourage consumers with sustainable repair options instead of seeking a replacement device altogether.

The official Philips Fixables web page has a link for anyone in the general public to submit a request to add a specific component. Philips will notify customers with a download link if the component they suggested is able to be shared to Philips Fixables. It's not clear what sort of turnaround time to expect for these requests and whether there are limitations on what components will be made available.

According to Philips, consumers must adhere to the recommended print settings for their components to get the best results. This is the only way to ensure the replacement part is sturdy enough to stand in for a repair. Compromising on fill space for time could make or break your user experience, for example, but if done correctly, a replacement 3D print can be a useful long term solution.

Other companies have had similar programs that support right to repair initiatives. Logitech recently unveiled a repair store in partnership with iFixit, with kits available for a handful of their products that can be repaired at home rather than replaced. Only time will tell how far the open source aspect of right to repair will be taken, but for now it looks like it's at least on the table for Philips.

Clean sheet ASIC architecture may be ready for 'Ultra QLC' with 128TB drives this year, scaling to 512TB in 2027.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Sandisk's CEO, David Goeckeler, has been boasting about a formidable new SSD controller dubbed Stargate. Combining Stargate with the latest BiCS8 Quad Level Cell (QLC) NAND, the company has a ""dynamite project"" in its hands, teased Goeckeler. ComputerBase reports (machine translation) that this should mean some massive capacity SSDs are on the way, scaling up to 512TB drives in 2027.

We don't have much in the way of technical details about the Stargate controller at this time, but we can read between the lines of the CEO's statement, and ponder over previous announcements and roadmaps. ""We have a new architecture coming out in the next couple of quarters that we call Stargate, new ASIC, clean sheet design and then, with BiCS 8 QLC … we just think that's going to be a dynamite project,"" ComputerBase attributes this statement to Goeckeler, taken from a recent investor Q&A session.

Based on the above, it may well be that Sandisk is going to leverage the Stargate controller and BiCS8 NAND in 128TB SSDs in the new DC SN670 data center drives, starting from Q3 this year. Moreover, roadmaps indicate that Sandisk aims to market 256TB drives the next year, and double up again with 512TB drives in 2027. The DC SN670 enterprise series SSDs were previously flagged as PCIe 5.0, but there is also the possibility that Stargate will be a technology that renews the series with up to a PCIe 6.0 interface.

For these expansive data center drives with new BiCS8 QLC NAND, with capacities of 2Tb (256TB) per IC, it is expected that the new controller will be scalable to 64 dies per channel. As ComputerBase notes, that will likely mean 32 channels would be required on the 512TB drive (coming 2027). Meanwhile, current client SSDs typically only offer up to eight channels.

With Computex around the corner, we hope that Sandisk can bring us up to date with what look to be rapidly developing plans for its capacious new SSDs. It would also be great to see larger capacity consumer SSD drives gain momentum via new levels of performance and affordability.

New evidence shows even brief exposure to junk food marketing, across TV, social media, radio, or billboards, leads to overeating in children. With brand-only ads proving just as potent, researchers are calling for urgent global advertising restrictions to protect kids' health.

Image Credit: nazarovsergey / Shutterstock

Exposure to junk food advertisements (relative to non-food) results in children and adolescents consuming significantly more calories during the day, regardless of the type of media advertising, according to a randomised crossover trial being presented at this year's European Congress on Obesity (ECO) in Malaga, Spain (11-14 May).

The study found that 7–15-year-olds exposed to just 5 minutes of adverts for foods high in saturated fats, sugar, and/or salt (HFSS) consumed an average of 130 kcals per day extra, which is equivalent to the calories in two slices of bread.

The timely research is presented as many countries across Europe and globally are considering implementing curbs on unhealthy food advertising to tackle rising childhood obesity levels.

""Our findings offer crucial novel information on the extent, nature, and impact of unhealthy food marketing via different types of media on young people's eating behaviour,"" said lead author Professor Emma Boyland from the University of Liverpool in the UK. ""Even short exposure to marketing of foods high in fat, salt, and sugar can drive excess calorie consumption and potentially weight gain, particularly in young people who are more susceptible to advertising and whose eating patterns influence their lifelong health.""

The causes of obesity are complex and influenced by many factors. While research has highlighted connections between product-based advertising of foods HFSS in audiovisual media and children's immediate [1] and later consumption [2], little is known about the impact of other forms of media, including brand-only (i.e., ads only featuring branding elements such as logos, but no food or beverage products) or audio advertisements (e.g., podcasts, radio), on shaping eating patterns.

It is also unclear whether food advertising effects differ by individuals' sociodemographic characteristics and how it may contribute to health inequalities.

To explore this further, researchers conducted a randomised crossover trial to quantify the impact of HFSS food (vs non-food) ad exposure on children's immediate and later intake, and to assess whether this was moderated by either advertisement content (brand-only vs. product), media type (audiovisual [e.g., TV] vs. visual [some social media posts] vs. audio [podcasts] vs. static [paper billboards]), or sociodemographic characteristics.

In total, 240 volunteers between the ages of 7 and 15 from schools across Merseyside, UK, participated in the study. On two different occasions, participants were exposed to five minutes of HFSS food and then non-food advertisements that were either brand-only or product-based through one of the four different media.

Researchers then measured children's subsequent ad libitum intake of snack and lunch foods and their height and weight to calculate their body mass index (BMI). Home postcodes were used to calculate area-level socioeconomic status (SES) using the 2019 English Index of Multiple Deprivation.

The analysis found that following exposure to HFSS food ads, children consumed more snacks (+58.4 kcals), more lunch (+72.5 kcals), and more food overall (snack and lunch combined, +130.90 kcals) than after exposure to non-food ads.

Interestingly, advertisement content did not moderate this effect, such that brand-only ads were as effective as product ads in increasing intake.

While neither the type of media (i.e., audiovisual, visual, audio, static image) nor socioeconomic status moderated children's intake, the researchers found that for every standardised unit increase in BMI score (zBMI, adjusted for a child's age and sex), children consumed an additional 17 kcal overall. According to Professor Boyland, ""Our results show that unhealthy food marketing leads to sustained increases in caloric intake in young people at a level sufficient to drive weight gain over time. This study is the first to demonstrate that brand-only food ads, for which there is currently no restrictive advertising policy globally, increase children's food intake. This new knowledge will help in the design of urgent restrictive food marketing policies that can protect children's health.""

A new research paper was published in Oncotarget, Volume 16, on May 8, 2025, titled ""METTL3 promotes oral squamous cell carcinoma by regulating miR-146a-5p/SMAD4 axis.""

In this study, researchers Jayasree Peroth Jayaprakash, Pragati Karemore, and Piyush Khandelia from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, India, discovered that a molecule called METTL3 contributes to the development and spread of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The study shows that METTL3 increases the levels of a small RNA molecule called miR-146a-5p, which blocks SMAD4, a key tumor-suppressing gene. These findings help explain why oral cancers are difficult to treat and may offer a new target for more effective therapies.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma is a common and aggressive cancer affecting the mouth and throat. It has a high death rate, mainly due to late detection, treatment resistance, and the cancer's ability to invade nearby tissues. In this study, the researchers focused on METTL3, an enzyme that adds chemical tags known as m6A marks to RNA, which change how genetic information is used by cells. They found that METTL3 is unusually active in OSCC cells, causing an increase in miR-146a-5p. This molecule, in turn, blocks the function of SMAD4, which helps control how cells grow and die in our bodies.

""METTL3, the primary m6A RNA methyltransferase, is significantly upregulated in OSCC cells leading to increased global m6A levels.""

When METTL3 was reduced or chemically blocked, miR-146a-5p levels dropped and SMAD4 levels increased. This shift slowed the growth of cancer cells, increased their death, and made them less likely to spread. When researchers reintroduced miR-146a-5p or lowered SMAD4 levels again, the cancer-promoting behavior returned. These results show that the METTL3–miR-146a-5p–SMAD4 pathway plays a key role in OSCC.

The findings open up new possibilities for treatment. Drugs that block METTL3 or miR-146a-5p or that restore SMAD4 could slow or stop tumor growth. One such drug, STM2457, which targets METTL3, has already shown promise in lab studies. As research progresses, targeting this molecular pathway may offer a new strategy in treating OSCC.

This discovery improves our understanding of how OSCC develops and avoids the body's defenses. By interfering with this newly discovered pathway, future treatments may become more successful, improving survival rates and quality of life for people with this disease.

A major Australian study finds that a child's long-term weight is closely tied to their parents' BMI before birth, especially the mother's, underscoring the urgent need to tackle obesity before pregnancy to break the cycle across generations.

Image Credit: kwanchai.c / Shutterstock

New research being presented at this year's European Congress on Obesity (ECO 2025) highlights the need to support women and their families with overweight or obesity to optimise their health and weight before they become pregnant.

The Australian study found that the greater a woman's BMI in pregnancy, the greater her child's weight from birth to age ten. This was the case regardless of whether the woman took part in a dietary and lifestyle intervention (LI) while pregnant or received standard antenatal care (SC). They also reported that the BMI of the father significantly influences the child's weight at age 10.

The results are the latest from the LIMIT trial, which involved 2121 pregnant women with overweight or obesity (average age 29.4 years, median BMI 31.1 in early pregnancy).

Half of the women took part in the LI, which consisted of advice and support for eating a healthy diet (for example, eating more fruit and fibre and reducing intake of refined carbohydrates and saturated fat) and increasing physical activity. The other participants received standard antenatal care (standard care group, SC).

""Women with overweight or obesity are at increased risk of pregnancy complications, like gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, caesarean birth and high infant birth weight, and for their children to develop obesity,"" says researcher Professor Jodie Dodd, of the University of Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.

""With approximately 50% of women entering pregnancy with overweight or obesity, the trial was carried out to see if changes in diet and physical activity during pregnancy could reduce these risks.""

The initial results1, published in 2014, showed that infants whose mothers participated in the LI group were 18% less likely to have birth weights above 4kg (8lb 13oz), a known risk for childhood obesity. However, the two groups had no other differences in maternal or birth outcomes, including pregnancy complications. 

The children were also followed throughout childhood. There was no evidence of a difference in the health or growth of the children from women in either the LI or SC group.

For the latest study, Professor Dodd and colleagues examined the effect of maternal BMI in early pregnancy on childhood weight and other measures of growth taken at birth and aged 6 months, 18 months, 3-5 years old, and 8-10 years old.

They found that a child's growth was linked to its mother's BMI in early pregnancy – and that every 5kg/m2 increase in a woman's BMI was associated with an increase in their child's BMI by 0.11kg/m2 at birth, to 0.74kg/m2 at 8-10 years of age.

The effect of maternal BMI became more prominent at age 3-5 and was particularly noticeable at 8-10. This was the case across the different measures of child growth studied—BMI, weight, and their standardised measures. Additionally, paternal BMI impacted child weight and BMI, particularly at ages 8-10.

Professor Dodd says: ""We know that women living with overweight or obesity are at increased risk of complications like high blood pressure in pregnancy. We also know that lifestyle interventions during pregnancy are ineffective for improving health outcomes for women and their baby/child.(1, 2, 3)

""What we found here was that a woman's BMI in early pregnancy impacts how her child grows from birth to 8-10 years of age –so, if a woman's BMI is higher going into pregnancy, her child's risk of overweight and obesity increases too. Fathers also have a role to play, as paternal BMI also contributes to child obesity.

""It's vital that healthcare providers focus on supporting women and their families to optimise their health and weight before pregnancy, if we are to intervene and potentially reduce the intergenerational cycle of obesity.""

New modeling reveals that high-emitting gas stoves can silently spread benzene throughout the entire home, raising cancer risk well beyond the kitchen, especially in small or unventilated dwellings.

Study: Exposure and health risks of benzene from combustion by gas stoves: A modelling approach in U.S. homes. Image Credit: goodbishop / Shutterstock

Gas stoves in the US burn propane or natural gas, producing nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde, and benzene among the byproducts. Chronic benzene exposure causes leukemia. A recent Journal of Hazardous Materials study examined benzene exposure among Americans using gas stoves.

Homes built after 2000 had lower benzene retention due to stricter building codes reducing air leakage by ~18% compared to older homes, suggesting that modern construction slightly mitigates (but doesn't eliminate) risks.

Americans spend 90% of their time indoors and are affected by indoor air pollution. 47 million American households use natural gas stoves, while hundreds of millions of households worldwide cook on gas stoves.

In 2020, there were 474,519 new cases of leukemia worldwide, and 311,594 deaths. In the USA, 2023 saw 59,610 and 23,710 leukemia cases and deaths, respectively, making it one of the top ten causes of cancer deaths.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), benzene is unsafe at any level. It can cause tiredness, sleepiness, headaches, body pain, tremors, memory loss, eye irritation, and skin allergies.

The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA), part of the California Environmental Protection Agency, set a reference level at 1 part per billion (ppb). Countries like France, Israel, Japan, Peru, and the European Union have set outdoor thresholds between 1.3 and 5 µg/m³.

The current study included 6.3 million Americans using the top 5% of benzene-emitting stoves. They used CONTAM, a model from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, that simulates air quality over multiple indoor zones and has been used to estimate pollutant levels originating indoors.

For the first time, they validated CONTAM's performance for VOCs, particularly benzene, by comparing predicted vs. measured benzene from indoor sources in residential buildings. Then, they combined earlier benzene measurements from 87 homes with room-based benzene measurements over time in six homes.

CONTAM then simulated benzene concentrations in 24 building layouts between 690 to 2840 square feet. Using USEPA Health Risk Assessment, they estimated health risks at low, medium, and high stove use levels, modified by using open windows, hoods, or both.

Low use meant five minutes cooking at medium flame on a single burner in the morning and two burners in the evening. Medium use included thirty minutes per burner on a medium flame—one burner in the morning and two in the evening—no oven use.

High use indicates medium flame for 41 minutes per burner, two in the morning and four in the evening, with 134 minutes of oven use at 350°F in the evening.



Graphical Abstract

Bedrooms showed the highest cumulative benzene exposure despite being farthest from kitchens, as people spent 9+ hours daily there—proving pollutants don't stay confined to cooking areas.

With high gas stove use, CONTAM predicted benzene concentrations in the 95th percentile in many of the 24 floor plans, which mixed effectively throughout the house after one or two hours of cooking, leading to significant concentrations in rooms beyond the kitchen. Thus, benzene exposure was highest for small homes (<900 square feet) and high gas stove use without ventilation.

It decreased progressively from apartment homes through manufactured homes and attached homes to detached houses. Bedrooms had the highest risk since people spend a third of their time there.

While calculated long-term non-cancer risks (Hazard Quotients) were low (HQ<1) for all scenarios, benzene concentrations under high gas stove use without ventilation did exceed California's OEHHA 8-hour reference exposure limit (REL), a benchmark for non-cancer effects. Low or medium use did not lead to such exceedances, irrespective of ventilation.

Vented hoods with 25% efficiency reduced the average benzene concentration by about 25%, to three-quarters of the unventilated situation. At 75% efficiency, it was only one-fourth.

Leaving windows open all day caused 95% to 99% of the benzene to dissipate with high and medium use. More realistically, benzene levels dropped by up to 42% with moderate window use—one hour in the morning and afternoon, and two hours at night.

Daily average benzene exposure concentration (ppbv) for ventilated and non-ventilated scenarios. Hood 25 % CE, 50 % CE, and 75 % CE represent the benzene capture efficiency of the hoods installed in dwellings. In this image, DH Low, DH Medium, and DH High represent benzene concentration in a detached home with low, medium, and high stove usage, respectively. Similarly, APT, MH, and AH indicate apartments, mobile homes, and attached homes, respectively. The error bars in these graphs represent the range of possible benzene exposure concentrations. Note: All these scenarios compared the top 5 % of benzene-emitting gas stoves for U.S. homes.

The Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk (ILTCR) refers to the estimated cancer risk caused by a specific pollutant via one pathway—in this case, benzene via inhalation.

High to medium use without ventilation increased the cumulative ILTCR above the WHO safety threshold, IE-06, by 4–16 times. The highest ILTCR was in the apartments with high use. Here, it increased ninefold among adults and 16-fold among children.

Children breathe faster and are lighter than adults, increasing benzene concentrations in their tissues. The estimate is probably low, as it does not factor in the time children spend in the kitchen during stove use.

Moderate gas stove use increased the risk in bedrooms but not in kitchens or living rooms. Low use did not increase the risk, irrespective of ventilation.

At high use, moderate window use decreased the cancer risk by more than 25% in an efficiency-vented hood. Both 50% and 75% efficiency hoods reduced but could not eliminate the risk for adults and children.

At medium use, 50% and 75% efficiency hoods substantially reduced cancer risk, though for children, the risk still remained above the WHO threshold even with a 75% efficiency hood.

For the studied population of 6.3 million Americans using the top 5% of benzene-emitting gas stoves, the study estimates an excess of 16–69 more leukemia cases each year when considering scenarios of high gas stove use with no ventilation, the higher number being for apartments. Overall, under these unventilated conditions for this specific high-emitter group, high and medium use are linked to an average of 43 and ~10 cases per year, respectively, vs 1.5 cases with low use.

This study is the first to estimate benzene-driven cancer risk from gas stoves and attributable leukemia risk among those at greatest risk from such exposure.

“Our study found that gas stove exposure increases the risk of cancer, particularly in homes with high and medium stove usage.” This exposure must be curbed to improve public health, especially in small and poorly ventilated houses.

Switching to electric or induction stoves, opening all windows for longer periods, or using high-efficiency hoods while cooking could reduce these risks. However, with high outdoor benzene levels, broader policy measures are required.

The study also validated, for the first time, CONTAM's predictive performance for benzene concentrations and distribution throughout the home. It shows the need to measure all-room indoor exposure to such pollutants since this determines the cumulative risk of attributable cancer.

A major study finds teens with abdominal obesity have enlarged brain areas linked to learning and emotion, raising concerns that excess weight and inequality may disrupt cognitive development and raise long-term dementia risk.

New research being presented at the European Congress on Obesity (ECO 2025) has found that several areas of the brain, including regions that play a critical role in learning and memory and the control of emotions, are larger in adolescents who are living with obesity.

The finding, from a study of thousands of teenagers in the US, raises concerns that obesity affects not only physical health but also learning, memory, and emotional control, says lead researcher Dr Augusto César F. De Moraes of UTHealth Houston School of Public Health in Austin, Department of Epidemiology, Texas, USA. ""This is particularly alarming, given that the teenage years are such an important time for brain development,"" he adds.

The percentage of children and adolescents worldwide who are living with obesity more than quadrupled among girls (from 1.7% to 6.9%) and among boys (from 2.1% to 9.3%) between 1990 and 2022.

In the US, it is estimated that more than one in three children aged 5 to 14 (36.2% of boys and 37.2% of girls) are living with overweight or obesity, equating to more than 15 million children.

Obesity – particularly abdominal obesity – has been linked to changes in brain development in the past, with regions key to cognition and the regulation of emotions seemingly particularly vulnerable.

Health inequalities, such as poor access to quality education, safe neighbourhoods, and healthy food, are well-known contributors to physical health problems, but their role in brain development and cognition is often overlooked.

To learn more about how obesity and health inequalities affect brain structure and cognition, Dr De Moraes and colleagues in the US, Brazil, and Spain analysed data from 3,320 participants in the ABCD study, an ongoing research project into how childhood experiences affect brain development and health.

The participants were recruited from cities in 17 states and followed for four years, from 2016 to 2018 and 2020 to 2022.  The average age of participants at baseline was 9.9 years, and 47.4% were girls.

They were categorised based on their obesity status, further stratified by abdominal obesity (measured using waist circumference). At baseline, approximately 34.6% of participants were classified as having abdominal obesity.

Structural MRI scans assessed the volume of several brain regions of the brain's subcortex, including the amygdala, hippocampus, caudate, accumbens, pallidum, putamen, and thalamus.

Health disparities were assessed using the Child Opportunity Index, which measures a child's opportunities based on the quality of neighbourhood features such as education, walkability, and access to healthy food and green space.

Several brain regions were larger in adolescents with abdominal obesity than in their peers without abdominal obesity. The biggest changes were seen in the hippocampus, which is involved in memory and learning, and the amygdala, which regulates or controls emotions, including fear, happiness, anger, and anxiety.

The hippocampus was approximately 6.6% larger, and the amygdala was about 4.3% larger in teens with abdominal obesity compared to those without.

The amygdala was particularly large in teenagers with very high levels of abdominal fat (a waist-to-height ratio over 0.5). The researchers raise concerns that excess body fat affects how the brain handles emotions.

The thalamus (which relays information about movement, hearing, taste, sight, and touch) and caudate (which helps control movement) showed smaller increases in size.

The study also found that teens from lower-opportunity areas showed reduced development in key brain regions, such as the hippocampus, putamen, and amygdala, compared with their peers in higher-opportunity areas. ""This difference was even more pronounced among adolescents with persistent abdominal obesity,"" says Dr De Moraes. ""It highlights the urgent need to address both social inequality and health risks to support not only physical wellbeing but also healthy brain development in youth.""

The authors explain that in the context of the young developing brain, both decreased and increased growth can cause harm. Thus, having lower-than-normal brain development, as shown in the teens in lower-opportunity areas, or larger-than-normal parts of the brain due to inflammation caused by obesity, can both be harmful.

Dr De Moraes concludes: ""Our findings suggest that obesity, particularly abdominal obesity, can impair teenagers' learning, memory, and emotional control. I worry about how these changes, which are occurring at the age of 13 or 14, might affect them later in life.

""There's even a chance they could be at a higher risk of things like memory problems or dementia as they get older.

""That's why we believe supporting healthier habits early on is so important, not just for physical health, but for brain health too.

""Treating and preventing adolescent obesity won't only improve health – it may improve brain health, too.""

A large study of nearly a million adolescent boys reveals that late puberty isn't as harmless as once thought, linking it to a sharply higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes in early adulthood.

Boys who enter puberty later than average are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes as adults, irrespective of their weight or socio-economic factors, according to research presented at the first Joint Congress between the European Society of Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) and the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE). The findings may uncover a potential new risk factor for boys developing type 2 diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes that results from the body's inability to make enough insulin or properly use insulin. Over 90% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes, which is driven by socio-economic, demographic, environmental, and genetic factors. Type 2 diabetes - once called adult-onset diabetes - most often develops in people 45 or older, but more and more children, teens, and young adults are now being diagnosed too, and researchers are investigating the various risk factors.

In this study, researchers from Israel examined 964,108 Israeli adolescent boys aged 16–19 years old who were recruited for military service between 1992 and 2015, of whom 4,307 were diagnosed with delayed puberty. They followed the individuals until the end of 2019. They found that adolescent boys with delayed puberty were about 2.5 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes in early adulthood than boys without delayed puberty, even after adjusting for birth year and country, socio-economic status, cognitive function, and education level. After accounting for body weight, the risk for type 2 diabetes was 37% higher in these boys. In addition, the researchers found that, among teens with delayed puberty, about 140 per 100,000 developed type 2 diabetes each year, whereas only about 41 per 100,000 teens without delayed puberty developed the disease every year.

""To our knowledge, our large-scale study is the first to report an association between delayed puberty in adolescent boys and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes,"" said lead author Professor Orit Pinhas-Hamiel from Sheba Medical Center. 

She added: ""One study suggests a protective association between delayed puberty and type 2 diabetes risk, but it had a low response rate (5.5%) and relied on recall-based anthropometric and pubertal timing data, using voice breaking as a surrogate marker for puberty.""

""Our results are surprising as delayed puberty is generally considered a benign condition,"" said Professor Pinhas-Hamiel. ""We think the higher risk of early type 2 diabetes in boys with delayed puberty may be due to a window of opportunity during development when the body is especially sensitive to hormones and environmental factors - similar to how early childhood shapes language skills or how puberty affects bone strength.""

""Our findings contribute to a better understanding of how pubertal timing may influence long-term metabolic health and highlight the need for medical follow-up to enable early diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Recognising delayed puberty in males as an early-life marker for increased risk of type 2 diabetes may help identify vulnerable individuals, allowing for targeted prevention strategies,"" said Professor Pinhas-Hamiel.

Researchers from Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, the Maccabi Healthcare Services, the Israel Defense Forces Medical Corps, the Gertner Institute for Epidemiology and Health Policy Research, and the Israel Center for Disease Control carried out the study. The data on the delayed puberty diagnoses were collected from the Israel Defense Forces Medical Corps, while the diabetes data were retrieved from the Israeli National Diabetes Registry.

A new model of tiny human ovary organoids, or ovaroids, has been developed from stem cells, according to research presented at the first Joint Congress between the European Society of Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) and the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE). This achievement may help to understand and develop treatments for conditions in which these organs do not develop or function properly, including differences in sex development and infertility.

During human embryo development, sex determination occurs at a very early stage, making the process difficult to study and understand. Typically, gonads begin to form at about four weeks, and the decision to become testes or ovaries happens at about six weeks. Sometimes, however, there is a mismatch between an individual's sex chromosomes and gonadal or anatomical sex - a group of rare conditions known as differences in sex development (DSDs). 

While these conditions are rare - about 1 in 4,500 - milder forms occur in about 1 in 200 people. DSDs are often detected prenatally or in infancy, though some do not become evident until puberty or later. In the past 15 years, a growing number of genes have been implicated in atypical gonad development, but approximately 50% of children with DSDs due to atypical gonad formation still lack a definitive genetic diagnosis. 

To understand gonad development and disease, researchers from the Institut Pasteur in Paris differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into granulosa-like cells - an ovarian somatic cell type which helps eggs grow and mature - and primordial germ cell-like cells. Next, they combined the two cell populations to form the human ovaroids that replicate key structural and functional aspects of ovarian follicles. 

While other ovaroid models exist, this is the first time for granulosa-like cells and primordial germ cell-like cells to be generated together, without introducing exogenous transcription factors, to produce organoids.

Transcription factors are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences and turn nearby genes on or off, so using external ones can override the innate genetic programme of the cells, which makes the derived populations unsuitable for disease modelling.""

Dr. Anu Bashamboo, senior author 

Previously, researchers from the Institut Pasteur, along with collaborators from the Francis Crick Institute, developed somatic cells of the testes - specifically Sertoli cells which are commonly affected in DSDs - from hiPSCs. The team grew somatic gonadal cells with male chromosomes (XY), carrying a genetic variant of a specific gene associated with atypical testis development. As a result, these cells were unable to form three-dimensional tubular structures that resemble the testis cords, leading to a dysgenetic gonad that mimics DSDs.

""By creating human-specific, lab-grown models of both testicular and ovarian development using induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), the research overcomes key limitations in the field -particularly the lack of suitable animal models due to poor conservation of developmental genes and mechanisms across species - and provides a powerful platform for studying gene function in a controlled environment,' said Dr. Bashamboo.

""Our work more broadly contributes a scalable, human-relevant model system to developmental biology, reproductive medicine and genetic diagnostics. It bridges the gap between basic science and clinical application, offering tools that could improve diagnostic yields and support the development of targeted treatments for individuals with DSDs and related reproductive disorders, including infertility and certain types of ovarian tumours"" said Dr. Bashamboo.

Dr. Bashamboo added: ""Our model also opens up new possibilities for screening drugs and environmental toxins affecting human gonads, personalized medicine and future therapeutic interventions.""

New research reveals a key metabolic advantage in women: once fat breakdown starts, it happens more efficiently than in men. This insight could help tailor future diabetes prevention strategies, especially for men at higher metabolic risk.

Image Credit: Jose Luis Calvo / Shutterstock

The research focused on lipolysis, the process through which triglycerides – lipids stored in fat cells – are broken down to produce free fatty acids and glycerol, which can be used as energy, during exercise or between meals.

""The breakdown of lipids through lipolysis is essential for energy balance and it is believed that doing it effectively may prevent type 2 diabetes and other metabolic complications of overweight and obesity,"" says Professor Peter Arner, of the Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

""Indeed, lipolysis is more effective in women than in men, which could be one reason why women are less likely to develop metabolic complications than men, despite having more body fat.""

Hormones called catecholamines play a key role in activating lipolysis and regulating the various steps in the process. When levels of these hormones increase, due to psychological stress or during exercise, for example, lipolysis is activated more strongly in women than in men.

A better understanding of how this occurs could pave the way for drugs and other treatments that lower the risk of type 2 diabetes in men who are overweight and obese.

To find out more, Professor Arner and Dr Daniel P Andersson, of the Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge in Stockholm, measured lipolysis in abdominal subcutaneous fat cells from adult women (n=774) and men (n=298).

The cells were incubated alone or with increasing concentrations of several catecholamines known to act at different steps in lipolysis.

The amount of glycerol released was used to measure the amount of lipolysis.

This revealed that the fat cells from the women were less sensitive to the catecholamines than the fat cells from the men, meaning that higher concentrations were needed to activate and regulate lipolysis.

However, when lipolysis was activated, it took place at a faster rate in the cells from the women than in those from the men.

Professor Arner says: ""Exercise is known to make it easier for catecholamines to activate lipolysis, and so men might be able to increase their protection against type 2 diabetes and other metabolic conditions by increasing their physical activity.

""Longer-term, our findings could aid in developing drugs that lower the risk of type 2 diabetes in men.""

Girls given antibiotics as newborns are more likely to hit puberty early, especially with multiple types of antibiotics. This large-scale study raises red flags about overuse of antibiotics in infancy and its long-term effects on hormonal development.

Girls given antibiotics during their first year of life, especially in the first three months, are more likely to enter puberty at an earlier age, according to research presented at the first Joint Congress between the European Society of Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) and the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE). The likelihood of early puberty was also higher among those exposed to a greater variety of antibiotic classes. The findings highlight the importance of appropriately using these medicines in infants and how early-life drug exposure could shape future health outcomes.

Early puberty, also known as central precocious puberty (CPP), is a condition characterised by the early onset of secondary sexual development in children. In girls, this means before age eight and, in boys, before age 9. Early puberty mainly affects girls and often has no apparent cause, while it is less common in boys. Over the past few decades, early puberty has been on the rise, and researchers are continuously investigating the potential contributing factors.

In this study, researchers from Hanyang University Guri Hospital and Hanyang University Medical Center analysed data on the antibiotic intake of 322,731 children, aged 0–12 months, in South Korea. They followed these children until the girls turned 9 years old and the boys were 10, and found that girls who were prescribed antibiotics before 3 months of age were 33% more likely to start puberty early. The risk was 40% higher in girls who received antibiotics before 14 days of age, and overall, the earlier the antibiotic exposure, the greater the risk of early puberty. Additionally, girls who used five or more classes of antibiotics had a 22% increased risk of early puberty compared to those who used two or fewer classes. No association was found between antibiotic intake and early puberty in boys. 

""This population-based study is one of the first to explore this association between early-life antibiotic use, including the timing, frequency and number of classes, and in such a large national cohort of children,"" said Dr Yunsoo Choe at Hanyang University Guri Hospital in South Korea, who was involved in the study.

Dr Choe added, ""In our earlier research, we found that exclusive breastfeeding was associated with a lower risk of central precocious puberty (CPP), supporting the idea that early-life factors affecting the gut microbiome or endocrine-metabolic pathways may influence pubertal development. The current study builds on this by examining antibiotic exposure as a possible modifier of pubertal timing, using a much larger population and more detailed exposure data.""

""Our results may encourage doctors and parents to consider the long-term effects of antibiotics when making treatment decisions for young children,"" said Dr Choe.

Next, the researchers will explore how early antibiotic use may affect pubertal development and whether repeated or long-term intake during childhood is associated with other aspects of growth, metabolism, or endocrine health. ""Our study adds to growing concerns about how antibiotics given in infancy could affect children's long-term development - possibly by altering the gut microbiome or hormonal balance - but the reasons behind it are still unclear,"" said Dr Choe. 

""Understanding these biological mechanisms may help guide safer antibiotic use and inform early-life care strategies for children,"" she concluded.

Sumeet Chugh, MD, whose research into sudden cardiac arrest has led to novel methods of predicting the usually fatal condition, has been promoted to vice dean and chief artificial intelligence health research officer at Cedars-Sinai.

Chugh was also honored recently with the Heart Rhythm Society's 2025 Distinguished Scientist Award for clinical science. The award was presented April 26 during Heart Rhythm 2025 in San Diego. 

This award recognizes Dr. Chugh's dedication to understanding sudden cardiac arrest and preventing this deadly emergency.""

Eduardo Marbán, MD, PhD, executive director of the Smidt Heart Institute, Cedars-Sinai

The Distinguished Scientist Award is given to an investigator who has made a lasting impact on patient care and the field of heart rhythm research. Chugh has dedicated his career to improving prediction and prevention of sudden cardiac arrest, a heart rhythm disorder that causes the heart to stop and often leads to instant death. He has published more than 275 scientific papers.

""I'm grateful to the Heart Rhythm Society for this recognition of our work and accept it on behalf of my colleagues and mentees at Cedars-Sinai,"" said Chugh, the Pauline and Harold Price Chair in Cardiac Electrophysiology Research. ""Our team is motivated to make a real impact on this deadly condition.""

According to the American Heart Association, more than 356,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occur each year in the U.S. Nearly 90% of them are fatal.

Chugh's team discovered a new method for identifying the best candidates for the implantable defibrillator, a lifesaving intervention. They also combined data from emergency responders, medical records and biological samples to predict imminent sudden cardiac arrest within hours to days of warning symptoms. Their work has improved identification of people at risk and led to the term ""near-term prevention"" of sudden cardiac arrest.

Chugh is also a leader in artificial intelligence research, which he has harnessed to improve prediction of sudden cardiac arrest.

In his new role as vice dean and chief artificial intelligence health research officer, Chugh will oversee the translation of AI research into clinical trials and patient care. He will lead the new Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Research Center (AIMRC), which will help departments and institutes incorporate AI into their research.

""Dr. Chugh is a foremost investigator in both heart rhythm and AI research,"" said Jeffrey Golden, MD, executive vice dean for Research and Education at Cedars-Sinai. ""His use of AI to assess the risk for sudden cardiac arrest has the potential to advance the field and save lives. We are eager for him to broaden his AI research experience to all areas of clinical care at Cedars-Sinai.""

In 2024, Chugh received the Distinguished Scientist Award for clinical science from the American College of Cardiology. He is a member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation and the Association of American Physicians, and is past president of the Association of University Cardiologists and the Cardiac Electrophysiology Society.

The Food and Drug Administration just approved an at home test that could be an optional alternative to a yearly pap smear. The test looks for human papilloma virus, or HPV, which causes nearly all incidences of cervical cancer. 

Each year in the U.S., about 11,500 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed and about 4,000 women die of this, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Current recommendations from the American Cancer Society (ACS), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the US Preventive Services Task Force are for patients to have a pap smear every three to five years. Pap smears test for cancer and precancerous cells, but also look for HPV. 

The at home test allows a woman to swab her vagina with a sponge like tool on her own rather than the speculum used for an in office gynecologic pap smear. Patients order the test online, consult with a doctor via telehealth, collect their own sample, and mail it in for analysis. This test will look for the HPV virus. Patients who test positive for HPV will be referred for a traditional pap smear. Experts say those who do not test positive for HPV, have virtually no risk of cervical cancer at that time and no further screening will be needed for three to five years.

Some women are scared of a traditional pap smear or find the process uncomfortable, as a result they put off this vital test. This could be an important tool in getting more women regularly screened, especially those that don't have access to a medical provider. Any type of test that helps detect cervical cancer is a win.""

Ami Vaidya M.D., Co-Chief of gynecologic oncology at Hackensack University Medical Center's John Theurer Cancer Center

HPV is a common virus that can cause several types of cancer. While most HPV infections clear up on their own without causing any health problems, persistent infections with certain high-risk HPV types can lead to cancers including cervical, anal, throat, tongue and tonsils, vagina, vulvar and penile.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Early childhood growth predicts adult height but not puberty timing, study finds","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250510/Early-childhood-growth-predicts-adult-height-but-not-puberty-timing-study-finds.aspx","Sun, 11 May 2025 03:59:00 GMT","

How tall your child will be may be decided in the first two years, but it won't tell you when puberty starts. This study sheds light on the lifelong significance of early growth and the limits of its predictive power.

Study: Early life growth is related to pubertal growth and adult height – a QEPS-model analysis​​​​​​​. Image Credit: Monkey Business Images / Shutterstock

Growth patterns during the first two years of a child's life may shape pubertal growth and adult height, but have little effect on pubertal timing, according to research presented at the first Joint Congress between the European Society of Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) and the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE). The findings highlight the importance of early-life growth, which could be used as a marker to predict future growth, development, and health. The results of this study have also been published in the journal Pediatric Research.

It is well established that the early-life growth period - from conception to approximately two years - is crucial in determining long-term health outcomes later in life. However, previous research has mainly focused on weight due to its widespread data availability, and the differences in pubertal growth, pubertal timing, and adult height between individuals have not yet been explained by early growth. In this study, researchers from Sweden analysed data on the height measurements, birth characteristics, and parental heights of 4,700 individuals with Nordic ethnicity, born in 1974 and 1990, from the GrowUp Gothenburg cohorts.

Using the Quadratic-Exponential-Pubertal-Stop (QEPS) model to assess growth patterns, the researchers found that early-life growth accounted for about 38% of the variation in pubertal growth, but the height changes during puberty explained only about 9% of the variation in adult height. About 67% of the difference in adult height between individuals was determined by early life, about 67% was by childhood growth, whereas about 60% was attributed to birth size and 37% to the average height of both parents.

""Surprisingly, the timing of puberty was not significantly influenced by early-life growth which suggests that, while early-life growth plays a significant role in growth during puberty and in determining final adult height, other factors such as genetics and the environment may be stronger determinants of pubertal timing,"" said first author Dr Carin Skogastierna from the University of Gothenburg and Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Sweden.

Previous studies have also shown similar associations between early-life growth and adult height. However, these associations have never been studied using the QEPS growth model - a model that allowed the researchers to examine specific growth stages separately. ""With the QEPS growth model, we were able to study specific early growth and specific pubertal growth, separately from the ongoing 'basic' growth for the first time,"" said Dr Skogastierna.

Dr Skogastierna said, ""We are continuing to work to understand how early-life growth relates to well-being, health, and socio-economic status later in life and how this information may be used alongside efforts to support early-life monitoring and healthy lifestyle changes to prevent disease.""

""It is important to note that if poor early growth is associated with reduced wellbeing in adolescents and a higher risk of disease and death in adulthood, such findings could further emphasise that healthcare aimed at young children is a good socio-economic investment for society,"" she added.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Multimodal AI system improves lung cancer screening accuracy","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250511/Multimodal-AI-system-improves-lung-cancer-screening-accuracy.aspx","Sun, 11 May 2025 16:46:00 GMT","

Lung cancer is one of the most challenging diseases, making early diagnosis crucial for effective treatment. Fortunately, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming lung cancer screening, improving both accuracy and efficiency. While current screening methods like low-dose CT help confirm suspicions of lung cancers, they often suffer from high false-positive rates and variability in reporting incidental yet critical findings, such as those pertaining to cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, the screening rate for low-dose CT remains low (<10%), due to a global shortage of radiologists.

A new study published in Nature Communications introduces a multimodal multitask foundation model that significantly enhances the capabilities of low-dose CT. This AI model improves the prediction of lung cancer risk by 20% and cardiovascular risk by 10%. Developed and tested by an interdisciplinary team from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), Wake Forest University (WFU), and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), this model is the first of its kind to simultaneously address more than a dozen related tasks, incorporating data from multiple sources including CT scans, radiology reports, patient risk factors, and key clinical findings.

The first author of the study is Chuang Niu, Ph.D., research scientist at RPI. The corresponding authors include Ge Wang, Ph.D., Clark-Crossan Chaired Professor and director of the Biomedical Imaging Center at RPI, Christopher T. Whitlow, M.D./Ph.D., professor at WFU, Mannudeep K. Kalra, M.D., professor at MGH. Key collaborators at RPI include Pingkun Yan, Ph.D., and Christopher D. Carothers, Ph.D., as well as other important coauthors.

The potential clinical impact of this work is immense. By integrating CT images with text information, the model significantly improves the detection and prediction of lung cancer, a critical factor in improving patient outcomes. Also, one of the major benefits of using foundation models in medicine is that when trained with large-scale screening CT scans and other data types, these models can boost the model performance in related new tasks. For instance, this model can improve performance in fields such as oncology, where task-specific data is often limited.

""This work has been significantly accelerated using RPI's high-performance computing facility,"" said Wang. ""Now, our multi-institutional team is further enhancing our foundation model on an increasing size of multimodal data, using both our own GPUs and New York State's Empire AI high-performance computing facility. The collaboration across leading institutions underscores the growing synergy between artificial intelligence and medical research, with the potential to revolutionize how diseases are detected and treated.""

Dr. Wang and his team are making important strides toward improving human health by combining the power of medical imaging, AI, and high-performance computing. RPI has always been at the forefront of computational sciences and engineering, providing faculty and students access to the world's best computational infrastructure to accelerate development and translation of transformative ideas. We are excited about what this work means for the future of early detection of diseases and look forward to seeing further advances.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study reveals phthalate exposure harms early sexual development in children","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250510/Study-reveals-phthalate-exposure-harms-early-sexual-development-in-children.aspx","Sun, 11 May 2025 03:12:00 GMT","

Every day, chemicals in toys, soaps, and packaging may be silently reshaping children's reproductive development. Italian researchers link phthalate exposure to measurable changes in genital growth by age three.

Image Credit: Danijela Maksimovic / Shutterstock

Three-year-old boys are more likely to have a shorter anogenital distance when their mothers have high levels of phthalates in their urine, according to research presented at the first Joint Congress between the European Society of Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) and the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE). In girls, the direct exposure to phthalates was associated with a shorter anogenital distance. The findings highlight how exposure to environmental pollutants can cause alterations in genital measurements during the first three years of life, which may affect sexual development and fertility later in life.

Phthalates are a large group of man-made chemicals widely used in everyday consumer products, such as household cleaners, food packaging, toys, cosmetics, and personal care products. These endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can interfere with our body's natural hormones and could have harmful health effects, including sexual development in children. For example, boys who are exposed to phthalates prenatally have been shown to develop genital defects, which could lead to infertility. Anogenital distance - the distance between the anus and genitals - is used as a marker of reproductive health related to hormone levels, lower semen quality, fertility and reproductive disorders. 

In this study, researchers from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia in Italy collected urine samples and anogenital distances from 188 children at birth, 3 months, 6 months, and 3 years, and from their 188 mothers, after giving birth and when their children turned 3 years old. They analysed these samples for eight major phthalate metabolites and found that all of them were detectable in every sample in mothers and children, progressively increasing as time passed. In fact, most children and their mothers exceeded the newer and more conservative risk threshold for phthalate exposure.

In addition, the researchers found that maternal phthalate exposure impacted only boys, and 3-year-old boys had a shorter anogenital distance. In contrast, the anogenital distances of 3-year-old girls were affected by their own exposure to phthalates, and the higher the exposure, the shorter the measurements were.

""We were surprised to find such high exposure for those phthalates which are currently less restricted. Bearing in mind that the cut-off levels for the anti-androgenic effect are dropping considerably, being exposed to these substances daily may indeed represent a major health risk for the younger generation in the long term,"" said Dr Laura Lucaccioni, lead author of the study. ""Preventive public health measures to protect vulnerable groups are needed.""

Dr Lucaccioni added: ""The eight phthalate metabolites studied in our work can be found in a wide range of everyday products, including toys, make-up products and soaps, among others. The key priority is to check the origin of our daily-use products and implement straightforward protocols to minimise exposure.""

""Our findings in boys suggest that both prenatal and family environmental exposure may significantly impact their sexual development. For girls, exposure to phthalates may play a role in other hormonal mechanisms. However, our study's sample size is small so we cannot firmly state that there are indeed differences between boys and girls, but we do establish that both may be affected by these endocrine disruptors,"" said Dr Lucaccioni.

The researchers plan to continue monitoring the population in their study and assess phthalate exposure and anogenital distances at pre-school age and around puberty. ""By continuing to monitor the population over time, we expect to identify the endocrine effects of prolonged exposure to phthalates, such as puberty disorders,"" said Dr Lucaccioni.

Enrique Sanz

Real Madrid faces the final stretch of the current league campaign focused on the fight for first place against FC Barcelona. In addition to those four matches that will be decisive for one of the most important titles of the season, the offices at Valdebebas are also focused on the upcoming Club World Cup.

Indeed, the board of directors led by Florentino Pérez has made it clear on more than one occasion that it is a tournament of great importance for the first team. That's why all competitive efforts, especially regarding injured players, are focused on the competition to be held in the United States during the months of June and July.

The footballer who might miss out on that desired competition is Jude Bellingham. The English ""5"" has been responsible for many of Real Madrid's sporting successes since he joined the first team, but most of his time is marked by an ailment. His left shoulder, injured since November 2023, has caused certain problems for the Birmingham midfielder.

The option of undergoing surgery arose last summer, but Jude Bellingham decided to forgo that opportunity due to the imminence of the Euro Cup in Germany in the summer of 2024. The discomfort has continued throughout the current season, bringing the footballer to a breaking point where he would need to make that trip to the operating room as soon as possible.

The information revealed by ""Rodra"" states that Jude Bellingham would like to undergo his operation as soon as possible, given that the recovery from that intervention is approximately one month. Undergoing the intervention at the end of the current LaLiga season, following the wishes of the British player, would leave him out for the Club World Cup.

That's why Real Madrid would have a different perspective on this situation. The journalist from ""Relevo"" recalls: the club understands that the ideal time for Bellingham to undergo surgery is after the Club World Cup, a competition that the entity has marked as strategic. This creates the dilemma and the two different opinions on the timeline of the operation.

The reality is that Jude Bellingham has been avoiding the opportunity to undergo the necessary operation to correct his shoulder ailment for too long. The presence of the Euro Cup last summer, as well as the Club World Cup in a month, jeopardizes the ideal time for him to go to the operating room.

Everything will depend on future conversations of the player himself, as well as his entourage, with Real Madrid. The white sports management hopes to register the English footballer for the competition to be held in the United States... but Jude Bellingham might undergo surgery at the end of this season to return in perfect condition for the 25/26 season, already under the tactical command of the new merengue coach.

It's just over a month until Lionel Messi‘s Inter Miami kick off the FIFA's shiny new expanded Club World Cup, but on current form they look a million miles off challenging world football's best and brightest.

Pressure is growing on Messi's old pal Javier Mascherano, who has just overseen Inter Miami's worst defeat of the Messi era.

Messi scored to end a rare four-match goalless streak in Saturday's clash with Minnesota United, but it was a mere consolation in a humbling 4-1 loss.

Before kick-off, Minnesota United's fans unfurled a banner that read: ‘History Over Hype, Culture Over Cash'.

And the message was vindicated by the chasm between the two teams on the day.

But it's only recently that Inter Miami have begun to resemble the worst excesses of Galacticos-era Real Madrid, a dysfunctional vanity project that struggles to get their superstar cogs clicking.

Last season they were the best team in the regular MLS season, winning the Supporters' Shield after providing a solid foundation for their eight-time Ballon d'Or winner to make a match-winning difference.

A record of 44 goals and 21 assists from just 54 appearances is testament not only to Messi's quality, but his team's ability to get him firing.

Mascherano himself has admitted that Inter Miami have been dependent on their biggest star.

“Teams have been dependent on Messi,” the Miami boss told reporters earlier this month.

“[Pep] Guardiola's Barcelona was dependent for years, Luis Enrique's Barcelona, Valverde's Barcelona, and the Argentina national team for 15 or 20 years.

“In other words, when you have a player like Messi, you're clearly going to develop a dependency on him. It's impossible not to depend on him.

“It's clear that there are days when the team perhaps helps him more and other days when it helps him less.”

Messi's latest goal almost looked too easy as he once again combined with his old Barcelona team-mate Jordi Alba. But we've seen less and less of that in recent weeks.

“I was in the stadium for Inter Miami vs NYRB and Messi's frustration with his teammates was evident,” noted ESPN pundit Hercules Gomez.

“Things are quickly coming to a head.

“If (Messi) gives it to one of Messi's friends — (Jordi) Alba, (Sergio) Busquets, Luis Suarez — he knows there's the capacity to return that play to him.

“There's a little more purpose and effort to the run. A lot of times when he gives it to another player, he waits. Because he knows, that's probably not going to get there… You can see Messi frustrated.”

Inter Miami recently lost in the semi-finals of the CONCACAF Champions Cup home and away – 5-1 on aggregate – to a Vancouver Whitecaps side that finished a distant midtable in last season's MLS Western Conference standings.

It's North America's equivalent to the Champions League and one of the few pieces of silverware that eludes Messi. Elimination in such an emphatic manner must have stung.

Domestic matters aren't going a whole lot better. After a promising start to the season, they've fallen to fourth in the Eastern Conference table after winning just two of their last six MLS outings.

“Leo is a competitive beast – it's normal,” Mascherano told the media following the latest defeat.

“Those of us who've known him for a long time understand how demanding he is, not only with himself but also with those around him.”

It's still relatively early days in the 2025 campaign and there's every chance that Miami can turn things around and end up lifting the MLS Cup come December. It's clear, though, that work needs to be done – and reinforcements may be required.

“I think we need to focus on bringing in someone who truly strengthens us as a team. And yes, I'm exploring options,” Mascherano said.

“Well, to be more precise, the club is evaluating options – especially in the attacking front.”

Inter Miami begin the Club World Cup with a relatively forgiving fixture against Egyptian outfit Al Ahly FC. Brazilian giants Palmeiras and Portuguese side Porto make up the four-team group, from which they can harbour realistic ambitions of getting through to set up a glamour tie in the knockout stages.

But things aren't clicking for Miami right now and the nature of their latest MLS defeat raises serious questions over whether Mascherano can avoid humiliation on the biggest stage of all.

Filed under:

Good news after good news.

Of course, it had to happen. Despite the day being about Bayern Munich's victory over Borussia Mönchengladbach, successful Bundesliga title victory and the last days of Thomas Müller's career at the Die Rekordmeister, a reporter inevitably still prepared questions about transfers. Board member for sport Max Eberl was the victim in this case, being bombarded with questions about potential transfer targets Jonathan Tah and Florian Wirtz as well as the Club World Cup and summer transfer window business.

Eberl refused to talk about Wirtz or Tah, but he did address the Club World Cup, thoughts about registering new transfers for the competition and a surprising reveal: “Because we have this new registration window between June 1 and June 10, we will be able to register [confirmed transfer in January from TSG Hoffenheim] Tom Bischof,” Eberl confirmed in a post match interview. “He will be there. And if you are speaking to people about transfers- more incoming than departing transfers- and it is possible, then you have the chance to do it and it would be nice to have that player for the Club World Cup.”

This certainly raises a few more questions, though. Who are Bayern in talks with that could join before the Club World Cup? The June registration window ends in about a month, after all. Eberl also hinted that departing players may not necessarily be kept for the Club World Cup. Müller signed a short term extension but someone like Eric Dier, who is already confirmed to be leaving the club at the end of his contract on June 30, may not participate in the tournament at all, even though the group stages take place before the end of June.

Jamie Carragher has said what he believes Liverpool should set as the price for Real Madrid to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold ahead of the Club World Cup this summer.

Alexander-Arnold announced earlier this month that he will leave Liverpool at the end of his contract on the back of the Reds wrapping up their second Premier League title.

Real Madrid have reportedly agreed terms with the England international, but the Spanish giants want Liverpool to release Alexander-Arnold before his contract expires on June 30, so that he can play in the all-new Club World Cup, starting on June 14.

But Carragher has urged his former club to ask Madrid for a £10m fee if they want them to rip Alexander-Arnold's contract up early, given how much money Los Blancos could earn through the tournament.

Carragher said on Sky Sports: “You're announcing it now to give Real Madrid the opportunity to maybe sign you for the Club World Cup, so that's what I was talking about a couple of weeks ago.”

Neville then interjected: “Would you take like a million quid if you were Liverpool for the Club World Cup?”

Carragher then replied: “Er, I think I'd want more than a million quid.”

Neville then further asked: “But would you take, would you take whatever price it would be to let him go and play in that tournament?”

Carragher replied: “I think if it was about five or ten million quid, because I think I could get, no, hang on, hang on.”

Sky Sports host David Jones then asked: “What is it, a hundred million to win the thing?”

Carragher replied: “Exactly. Have you seen how much money it is to win it?”

Jones then asked: “So you could help a major European rival by helping them win the thing?”

Carragher said: “Right, well, but if they're going to win a hundred million and he's going to help them, because don't forget, they haven't got any right back. The right back to play in there is not a right back. So it's not just like bringing a player in. Give us ten million quid.”

Neville concluded: “Well, the price has just been set, mate.”

Former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan has encouraged Liverpool to stand firm because Real Madrid are “not a charity”.

“Good for them – why shouldn't they? Do Liverpool want to be a contributing factor to Real Madrid being crowned in inaugural Club World Cup champions?” Jordan said.

“He'd keep you to the contract if there wasn't an alternative. He wouldn't be saying: ‘I've finished my last game so I don't need to be paid up to June 30'. Because the circumstances have changed and he's already got himself an outcome and Madrid want this outcome.

“If you go to this tournament, what do you get if you win it? £100 million and if Liverpool give them a player to help them with that, they've just given Madrid £100 million to make sure Madrid can maintain their dominance in European football so why? They're not a charity.

“Of course, they are (a direct rival). Who are going to be playing in the Champions League next year? It would be commercial sense. So what. Trent Alexander-Arnold has achieved what he wanted to achieve and you can believe the benefits of Trent Alexander going on a free have landed where… in his pay packet.”

World Cup

This is the fourth in a series on The Athletic looking back at the winners of each men's World Cup. Previous articles have looked at Uruguay in 1930, Italy in 1934 and then again in 1938. In 1950, Uruguay were crowned champions again to make it 2-2 between the two countries.

Due to the Second World War, 12 years had passed since the previous World Cup in France — during which time the Jules Rimet Trophy had supposedly been stashed underneath the bed of Ottorino Barassi, president of the Italian football federation. As they retained their world title in 1938, his nation had held the game's most prestigious piece of silverware for 16 years. Uruguay had been the only other winners of the tournament in its inaugural staging. And they would come out on top again here.

Brazil were awarded the hosting rights for World Cup 1950 and were therefore considered favourites to win it on home soil, just as Uruguay and Italy had done in 1930 and 1934 respectively.

There was still something of an issue in terms of general participation.

Only 31 of the 73 FIFA member nations entered, with Argentina refusing to compete in a tournament they'd wanted to host, West Germany banned from FIFA so soon after the war, previous finalists Austria and Czechoslovakia simply not entering, and Italy present but badly affected by the Superga air disaster in May 1949, in which several of their best players had died. Then France withdrew after realising the considerable travelling that would be involved between games in a country as huge as Brazil.

Brazil's downstairs neighbours Uruguay, obviously, didn't have to come far, and while the European nations struggled with the South American climate, it wasn't really an issue for the competition's 1930 winners.

The structure of this tournament was somewhat bizarre, with Uruguay the major beneficiaries.

The previous World Cup in 1938 had been contested as a straight-knockout tournament, but FIFA — controversially at the time — voted to move to a system featuring four groups of four, with the winners of each one progressing to the next stage.

But withdrawals left the World Cup with only 13 competing teams, not 16. It was too late to conduct another draw, so Uruguay were fortunate to be placed in a two-team group alongside Bolivia (they had qualified without playing a game after Argentina withdrew), who they thrashed 8-0. Contemporary reports suggest the scoreline could have been much greater had the Uruguayans — three up after 23 minutes — not eased off.

Furthermore, no actual final was scheduled. The top four were to be decided on round-robin results in another (four-team) group, and therefore the organisers simply got lucky that Uruguay and Brazil, the two sides in contention for the trophy going into the final pair of games, met then at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro.

A draw would have been enough for Brazil to finish top of the final group and so lift the World Cup, which would have been a quite unsatisfactory climax. Uruguay needed a win. That final game was therefore not literally the final, but has come to generally be considered as such.

While doubt persists about whether Uruguay's victorious manager in 1930 was truly a manager by today's definition of the job, there is scepticism about whether their manager in 1950 had complete authority over his side.

While Juan Lopez Fontana had that role officially, the players grew unhappy with his defensive approach. Ahead of that final game against Brazil, the team held a meeting where they were encouraged by captain Obdulio Varela to be braver than Lopez Fontana had requested.

Indeed, at this stage in football's development, a team's captain was often considered more influential than the manager. Varela was commended for his pre-match team talks, for ordering his team-mates to behave in certain ways at key moments, and, after the tournament, for disobeying orders not to leave the team hotel, and going out drinking with Brazilians instead.

Lopez Fontana, in fairness, was a highly respected figure who was still in his job come the 1954 World Cup, then served as an assistant to several subsequent Uruguay managers.

While other national teams had shifted towards a system featuring a third defender — the centre-half dropping back — Uruguay's base formation was more closely related to the system used by previous World Cup-winning sides: two physical defenders, three half-backs, two creative inside-forwards, two quick wingers and a centre-forward.

That said, left-half Victor Andrade (nephew of fellow World Cup winner Jose Andrade from 1930) was written about in almost purely defensive terms, and right-half Schubert Gambetta is also sometimes listed as a defender, too. As other nations beefed up their defence by having the centre-half drop back, Uruguay were gradually moving their right-half and left-half in the same direction. This is why — as Jonathan Wilson notes in his book Inverting The Pyramid — Uruguay are unique in using the No 4 and No 6 as their full-backs in their traditional numbering system.

Like every successful side in these early years of the World Cup, Uruguay 1950 had an outstanding centre-half in Varela, who was physically dominant and also a key attacking weapon. His late, long-range equaliser to secure a 2-2 draw with Spain in their opening match of the final group stage was crucial in allowing them to challenge for the trophy.



Juan Alberto Schiaffino had all the hallmarks of a legendary South American attacker: slender, elegant, highly creative. He was regularly described as a ‘genius' and played as the inside-left in Uruguay's five-man attacking line. He was a clever passer, an elusive dribbler and a prolific goalscorer all in one, notching three goals in this World Cup — including their second-half equaliser in the final.

He was also highly influential four years later at the next World Cup in Switzerland — Uruguay held Hungary, the outstanding side of that tournament, to a 2-2 draw after 90 minutes in the semi-final, but once Schiaffino got injured, they ran out of ideas.

Schiaffino spent the majority of his career with Penarol, who he later managed, in his hometown of Montevideo. Upon his move to Milan following that 1954 tournament, he adopted a deeper role, roughly in the Andrea Pirlo mould, before eventually dropping back even further to become a renowned sweeper for Roma.

Like many South Americans of this period who moved to Serie A, he also switched international allegiance and began to represent Italy rather than his homeland.

He only played 21 times for Uruguay, but he is probably their greatest ever footballer.

Brazil versus Uruguay. Bookmakers offered odds of just 1/10 for Brazil to lift the trophy, and there was such confidence across the host country after demolishing Sweden and Spain 7-1 and 6-1 respectively in their first two matches of the second group stage that various newspapers printed front pages on matchday hailing the anticipated triumph.

The modern convention is for opponents to pin these pages up on the dressing-room wall as motivation. Uruguay took things a step further and used them to line the floor of their bathroom. This didn't help their inside-right Julio Perez, who was so intimidated by the crowd (174,000 officially, possibly around 200,000 unofficially, and probably the largest in football history) that he wet himself as the anthems were being played.

Foreshadowing Brazil's collapse, shortly before the game, their flag was raised… upside-down.

Once the match kicked off, it was all Brazil, with Uruguay defending their box manfully and hoofing the ball clear rather than putting together any notable counter-attacks. But both sides hit the post before half-time — Oscar Miguez for Uruguay, Jair for Brazil.

Brazil went ahead barely a minute into the second half, with Friaca firing a low shot into the far corner from the right flank. This prompted Uruguay captain Varela to pick an argument with George Reader, the English referee, over a non-existent offside, which included him requesting an interpreter at one stage. Varela knew there had been no offside, he simply wanted to halt Brazil's momentum.

Uruguay hit back, and their key player was now Alcides Ghiggia, who constantly motored past Brazil's hapless left-half Bigode. Midway through the half, he beat Bigode, looked up and found Schiaffino making a run to the near post for a cutback. The ball bobbled slightly before Schiaffino hit it, but this meant he produced a shot with both power and curl inside the near post, although he later admitted he hadn't intended to strike it quite in that manner. No matter, it was 1-1.

That result would still see Brazil crowned champions. But the momentum was now with Uruguay.

Ghiggia was the star player in the final, and having galloped down the Uruguay right to create the opener, he threatened to do the same thing 11 minutes from the end of the 90.

Schiaffino was waiting to score a carbon-copy goal, and that's what Brazil goalkeeper Moacir Barbosa expected. But Ghiggia could also fire home at the near post, as he'd done a week earlier in that draw with Spain. That's what he did here, rifling home the winner.

Barbosa was regarded as Brazil's best-ever goalkeeper, but was harshly blamed for what was, by the standards of the time, a relatively minor error. He and Brazil's other black players received disgraceful abuse after this loss, being labelled unpatriotic, while Barbosa was forced to flee his home due to death threats.

Following this World Cup, Barbosa worked in an administrative role at the Maracana, the scene of his disastrous moment. Several years after the event, he was presented with the goalposts he'd allowed the ball to squeeze between. He sawed them up, took them home and burned them as a form of exorcism.

But that wasn't the end of his pain.

Brazil's treatment of him was despicable, considering he was possibly the country's best goalkeeper of the 20th century. More than 40 years after this match, in a country big on superstition, he was both removed as a commentator from the broadcast of a Brazil game and shunned when visiting the national team's training camp, because of fears he would bring them bad luck. He died in 2000, aged 79, after years of loneliness.

Amid all the anger they directed at their own team, Brazilians reacted sportingly to Uruguay's victory. They applauded the winners at their trophy presentation. Ghiggia was always respected in Brazil, returning to the Maracana in 2009 to be inducted into the stadium's walk of fame. He died in 2015 — 65 years to the day after his famous World Cup-clinching goal.

All sorts of quotes have been attributed to Ghiggia, some of which seem a bit too Hollywood to be taken seriously. But his summary of the key moment is a nice analysis of the risk-and-reward of shooting for the near post, rather than crossing. “Barbosa did the logical thing,” he reportedly said. “And I did the illogical thing.”

Surely not. Uruguay only played four games — two fewer than Brazil. Not only did they have the fortune to compete in a two-team opening group against minnows Bolivia, they didn't perform particularly well in the second one, having to come from behind in that 2-2 with Spain and only squeezing past Sweden 3-2 thanks to an 85th-minute goal.

In contrast, Brazil had beaten the same opponents by a combined score of 13-2, having previously finished top of their (four-team) first-round group via clean-sheet wins over Mexico (4-0) and Yugoslavia (2-0) and a 2-2 of their own with Switzerland.

In his history of the World Cup, Ian Morrison says their 1950 side played “some of the finest football ever played at international level”, while Brian Glanville described the Brazilians as playing “football of the future — tactically unexceptional but technically superb”. Their three central attackers, in particular — Jair, Zizinho and Ademir — received rave reviews for their combination play.

But ultimately, Brazil, as a nation, exuded overconfidence going into the final game, and the players themselves suffered from nerves — not for the last time in a World Cup.

Often, knockout competition can produce the ‘wrong' winners, but this World Cup was decided by a league table, which tends to favour the better sides on paper, and Brazil still couldn't get over the line.

They would have to keep on waiting. By the time of the next World Cup, they had ditched their white kit, now associated with this 1950 failure, in favour of the yellow, green and blue strip known worldwide today.

Four editions in, the World Cup had still been won by only two nations, with Italy and Uruguay crowned champions of the two tournaments played on their home continents of Europe and South America respectively.

But things were about to change in 1954.

Controversy of 2010 Leinster final lives on in the Battle of the Boyne


‘For a period, Joe Sheridan opened his letterbox with caution after he had received  poison-pen letters.' Picture by David Maher

In 2021, some 11 years after Joe Sheridan and Meath had written themselves into GAA infamy, the Irish Independent compiled a list of the 50 biggest GAA controversies of the previous 50 years. Sheridan's last-gasp goal, that denied Louth a first Leinster title in 53 years, ranked at number four. 

It sat behind the emotive opening of Croke Park and scrapping of Rule 42, Cork's ‘dirtiest' war and the strike of the 2000s and the riotous hurling summer of 1998 that began with Colin Lynch's three-month ban and raged on with a sit-down protest on the pitch after an All-Ireland semi-final was blown up early.

Arnold's appointment was announced on social media on Friday by the Iraq Football Association, which published photographs of the 61-year-old being welcomed in Baghdad by officials from the national body.

""We are delighted to announce Graham Arnold as the new head coach of the Iraq national team,"" the federation said in a post on Instagram. ""Welcome to the Lions of Mesopotamia!""

Arnold replaces Jesus Casas at the helm after the Spaniard's departure in the wake of a 2-1 loss to Palestine in March during the third round of Asia's qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup.

That result left the Iraqis in third place in the standings in Group B, four points adrift of leaders South Korea and one behind the Jordanians.

The first two finishers in each of Asia's three qualifying groups advance automatically for the World Cup while the teams in third and fourth progress to another round of preliminaries.

Arnold's first game in charge will be in Basra on June 5 against the Koreans before he takes his new team to Amman to face Jordan five days later. Iraq are attempting to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1986.

The appointment sees Arnold return to international management more than seven months after standing down as Australia head coach.

Arnold, who led the Australians to the knockout rounds of the 2022 World Cup during a six-year spell in charge, quit after an uninspired start to the current phase of qualifying when his side lost to Bahrain and drew with Indonesia in September.

He was replaced by Tony Popovic, the former Western Sydney Wanderers coach who has taken the Socceroos to second place in Group C of Asia's qualifiers ahead of games against Japan and Saudi Arabia in June.","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","soccer"

						Senegal and Portugal will go head-to-head for the third place					

Belarus win 5-2 against Senegal.
The first semi-final of the tournament delivered a gripping encounter between two teams making their second appearances at this stage – Belarus and Senegal.

Belarus opened the scoring three minutes into the game through their goalkeeper Avgustov, whose long-range strike took a bounce in front of Senegal's goalkeeper and found the back of the net to give his side a 1-0 lead. Senegal responded in the last minutes of the opening period, as Sidy skilfully flicked in a shot from Diatta to make the score at 1-1.

Belarus came out firing in the second period. Bryshtsel restored their advantage with a well-placed penalty driven into the left side of the net to make it 2-1. Moments later, Hapon extended their lead with a flying header. Belarus continued to apply pressure, and Bryshtsel struck again, securing his brace with a composed finish inside the final two minutes of the period, to put Belarus 4-1 ahead heading into the final period.

Senegal showed resilience in the third period. Diagne pulled a goal back two minutes in with a smart finish to reduce the deficit. However, Belarus maintained their composure and Bokach capitalised on a counter-attack to score Belarus' fifth, to seal an emphatic 5-2 victory and create history for the nation.

Brazil win 4-2 against Portugal.
Brazil overpowered Portugal to reach a consecutive FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup final. In a heavyweight semi-final clash, defending champions and six-time winners Brazil faced off against two-time champions Portugal, who struck first midway through the opening period. Brilhante delivered a pinpoint cross to Bernardo, who rose to head the ball into the net, giving Portugal a 1-0 lead.

Brazil responded early in the second period. Just a minute in, Thanger produced a spectacular acrobatic finish from an assist by Mauricinho to level the score at 1-1. Moments later, Filipe Silva fired a long-range shot into the net to put Brazil in front. Portugal fought back, and midway through the period Lourenço's goal brought his team back on level terms.

The final period was decisive. Brazil captain Rodrigo calmly converted a spot kick early in the period to reclaim a 3-2 lead. With momentum shifting, Brazil capitalised via a quick transition, and Catarino found the net with four minutes left to play. Brazil aggressively managed the closing minutes, stifling any Portuguese comeback attempts, as the holders marched on to yet another final, with a 4-2 win over Portugal.

Post

Former Germany international Gerald Asamoah has revealed why African countries will struggle to win the FIFA World Cup.

The closest Africa has come to the World Cup trophy, was in the 2022 edition in Qatar, where Morocco played in the semifinals but lost to Croatia in the third/fourth place game. 

Asamoah, 46, helped Germany finish second to Brazil at the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and Korea after being neglected by his homeland Ghana.

The burley former Schalke forward believes countries from the African continent still face challenges in competing at the highest level of global football.

""I want to see this before I leave the earth, but it is not going to be easy,"" he said, as reported by Joy Sports.

""It is about teamwork, and this is a problem Africans have. We have always had some issues in the team,"" he added.

Ghana and Senegal have come close to making it to the quarterfinals, but have ultimately fallen short of clinching the trophy.

The next World Cup will be held in 2026 across the USA, Canada and Mexico, with qualifiers still ongoing.

Ghana's Black Stars, who sit top of Group I with 15 points, are on course to qualify for the tournament. They will face Chad and Mali in September's World Cup qualifiers.

Holger Rune collapsed completely on Sunday afternoon and is out of the ATP 1000 tournament in Rome after a marathon match in three sets against French Corentin Moutet.

In a match that lasted a grueling three hours and 46 minutes in the baking Italian sun, the Dane was in the end forced to surrender against the Frenchman losing 7-5, 5-7, 7-6.

The Danish tennis superstar, who is number ten in the world rankings, went into the match as big favorite against the Frenchman, who is ranked as world number 83.

Even so, the French had the necessary power to dominate most baseline duels in a first set in which he prevailed 7-5, before Rune gradually seemed to recover his gameplan in the second set which he won 7-5

Thus, the match had to be decided in the third set, which, like the previous two, had to be decided in a virtual nail-biter.

The match was characterized by far too many Danish mistakes, and a staggering eight double faults from Holger Rune proved decisive.

Holger Rune is usually a specialist in decisive tiebreakers but it didn't work out for the Dane this time as he lost 7-4 and is thus out of one of the big warmup tournaments for the French Open in June. ","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","tennis"

Novak Djokovic's quest for a 100th career title has gone on far longer than the legendary tennis player expected. Even worse, Djokovic's season has gone from bad to worse as he has struggled immensely on clay courts.

Currently, Djokovic is riding a three-match losing streak and is 0-2 on clay. Following his early exit at the Madrid Open, Djokovic unexpectedly pulled out of this week's Italian Open without providing a reason.

We may now have an explanation, as a new picture from Sport Klub show Djokovic wearing a knee brace. In fact, it is the same brace he wore on his right knee during the latter half of the 2024 ATP season.

Last year, Djokovic tore his meniscus in the French Open and made an incredible return to finish the year on a strong note. However, the 24-time Grand Slam champion kept the brace on his knee for the remainder of the year.

Unfortunately, Djokovic appears to be struggling with the same knee again. So far, Djokovic and his camp have not provided any information on the injury. 

Fans can expect Djokovic to be asked about the issue before the start of the Geneva Open. Djokovic accepted a wildcard spot for the ATP 250 tournament that runs from May 18-24.

Currently, Djokovic is the World No. 6 with a record of 12-7 with zero titles. He needs just one tournament title to become the third men's player to reach 100 career single titles (joining Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Fils maintains perfect Tsitsipas record; former Rome champs Medvedev, Zverev advance","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/fils-tsitsipas-rome-2025-sunday","Sun, 11 May 2025 16:02:39 GMT","

Arthur Fils continued his impressive recent ATP Masters 1000 record and his dominance against Stefanos Tsitsipas at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome on Sunday, when he advanced to the fourth round following a high-quality display.

The dynamic Frenchman recovered from a slow start on Grand Stand Arena, where he entertained the crowd with his flashy shotmaking to earn a comeback 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory against Tsitsipas in one hour and 55 minutes.

""I told him at the net he was playing unbelievable in the first set,"" Fils said. ""He was killing me with his forehand, his backhand, at the net. Serving very good. I could not do a lot of things but in the second set I started to find the rhythm and a way to fight and was happy to finish strong in the third.""



Fils played aggressively in the second and third sets, taking large cuts of the ball off both wings to pin Tsitsipas back, while he held his nerve down the closing stage to reach the fourth round at a Masters 1000 event for the fifth time in his past six events.

The 20-year-old, competing at a career-high No. 14 in the PIF ATP Rankings, has often found his best level at Masters 1000 level in 2025, advancing to quarter-finals in Indian Wells, Miami and Monte-Carlo.

At the ATP 500 event in Barcelona last month, Fils reached the semi-finals, moving past Tsitsipas on the way. He now holds a standout 4-0 Lexus ATP Head2Head series record against the former Nitto ATP Finals champion following his latest win.

""If you let him play, I think he is one of the best clay-court players,"" Fils said on Tsitsipas. ""His forehand is a huge weapon. I tried to put him under pressure because if I am not putting him under pressure I am dead.""

Fils is 7-2 against Top 20 players on clay since the start of 2024 and will look to improve that record when he meets the No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings Alexander Zverev in the fourth round. Zverev beat Lithuanian qualifier Vilius Gaubas 6-4, 6-0 in 86 minutes.

""I didn't play my best in the first set but he challenged me... He has won four matches here already, beating quality players like Denis [Shapovalov],"" Zverev said. ""I have huge respect for guys coming through qualifying and guys coming through on Tour. I have been there myself, a long time ago, but I have been there. He is playing great tennis and I am sure we will see more of him.""

The defending champion Zverev, who also triumphed in the Italian capital in 2017, was comfortable throughout his third-round win and has now won his his past nine matches in Rome. The German is seeking his second trophy of the season after winning on home soil in Munich last month.

""In the beginning I felt like it was a bit difficult for me and it was really windy,"" Zverev said. ""The wind really calmed down after the first set and then it was easier for me to get in a rhythm and have clean strokes. I am someone who wants to play with power and doesn't have variety as much, so for me when I am hitting the ball cleanly it is a benefit to me and my game.""






Daniil Medvedev was also an early winner on Day 5 in the Italian capital, where he dispatched Alexei Popyrin 6-4, 6-1.
Medvedev has fond memories in Rome, having lifted the trophy in 2023. Seeking his first title since then, the 10th seed will take confidence from his dominant win against Popyrin.
The 29-year-old saved six of seven break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and committed 16 unforced errors to 28 from Popyrin, who won his maiden Masters 1000 title in Montreal last year.
Medvedev faces Lorenzo Musetti in the fourth round. The Italian recorded his 150th tour-level win with a 6-4, 6-3 victory against Brandon Nakashima.
Musetti is 20-4 on clay since last July, highlighted by winning bronze at the Paris Olympics in 2024 and reaching his first Masters 1000 final in Monte-Carlo in April. Backed by a vocal home crowd on Sunday, Musetti pulled Nakashima from corner to corner with his variety and explosive play.

Nick Kyrgios looks set to make what may be a final appearance at Wimbledon this summer and he could also make a rare appearance at the French Open later this month.

Aussie maverick Kyrgios has struggled with injuries since his run to the 2022 Wimbledon final and he has given several hints that he will quit tennis.

Yet he also hinted at the start of 2025 that he would have a final shot of making a run at his favourite tournament at Wimbledon, where he lost in the 2022 final against Novak Djokovic.

“For me, obviously this year I've been out for a year and a half, two years, so I don't know what this year's going to bring,” he said after struggling with injuries as he was beaten in his opening match at the Australian Open in January.

“Obviously, I'm going to trust the process, I think I'm hitting the ball great. I've still got a long way to get back to that same level I was in 2022.

“For me personally, I couldn't see myself playing more than probably this year high-level singles anymore. “I think I'm weighing up my options.”

A fully fit Kyrgios could be a threat on grass courts, but former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash told Tennis365 that his fellow Aussie will struggle to come back to the top of the game after so long on the sidelines with injuries.

“He's been out for two years and that's a long time. He needs to be super-fit to get through matches back-to-back,” Cash told Tennis365. “Over three sets, he will probably be okay to do it, but can he do it over five sets in a Grand Slam?

“He's always had the ability, but it is issues with his mind and his body that have held him back. It's good that he's playing. There's nothing worse than being injured and I have known enough about that in my career.

“The talent is there, but you would question the physical side of it in longer matches when you have been out for so long.”

Kyrgios has given a big hint that he will also look to play the French Open later this month, after confirming he is practising on clay courts.

He has been damning about his views of clay court tennis in recent years, but it appears he is ready to try his luck for one last time at Roland Garros after posting a message on his social media platform confirming he is preparing to play in Paris later this month.

Kyrgios could enter the tournament using his protected ranking that is given to players who have been out of action for an extended period due to injury.

He has had limited success at Roland Garros, with his runs to the third round in 2015 and 2016 the best efforts he can look back on from his trips to the French capital.

Venus Williams and Andre Agassi headline a star-studded line-up for TNT Sports and their French Open coverage later this month.

The seven-time Grand Slam champion has not played a competitive match in over a year, though she is yet to announce her retirement from the sport.

But the American will now form part of TNT Sports' coverage in the first year of a 10-year deal to cover the French Open, following a bumper $650m (£490m) deal signed last year between Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), the owner of TNT Sports, and the French Tennis Federation (FFT).

Williams will be joined by Agassi, and fellow Hall of Famers John McEnroe, Lindsay Davenport, Jim Courier, Chris Evert, Mats Wilander and Boris Becker as hosts, commentators and contributors.

The broadcaster states that Williams will contribute “special features” to the coverage in its inaugural UK and U.S coverage for Roland-Garros.

More talent comes in the shape of CoCo Vandeweghe, who won the 2018 US Open women's doubles title, Sam Querrey, the 10-time ATP singles champion and co-host of popular podcast ‘Nothing Major'.

While Sloane Stephens, a Roland-Garros singles finalist in 2018, and Chris Eubanks, still active on the ATP Tour, will also feature throughout the fortnight.

British fans can look forward to familiar faces Tim Henman and Laura Robson, with commentators Nick Mullins, Naomi Cavaday, Anne Keothavong and Miles Maclagan and presenters Rachel Stringer, Lesly Boitrelle and Craig Doyle.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Novak Djokovic given pessimistic Grand Slam prediction by tennis icon","https://www.tennis365.com/tennis-news/novak-djokovic-chris-evert-grand-slam-verdict-french-open","Sun, 11 May 2025 11:16:44 GMT","

Tennis icon Chris Evert has cast doubt on Novak Djokovic's chances of winning another Grand Slam title while also asserting she “would never underestimate him.”

Djokovic‘s most recent Grand Slam triumph was the record-extending 24th men's major title he secured at the 2023 US Open.

The former world No 1, who will turn 38 on May 22, will have his next opportunity to add to his major tally at the 2025 French Open, which will run from May 25 to June 8.

The Serbian has lost the last three matches he has played in straight sets, with a defeat to Jakub Mensik in the Miami Open final followed by disappointing opening match exits in Monte Carlo and Madrid.

Djokovic chose to skip the Italian Open after his Madrid loss to Matteo Arnaldi, and he has added the event in Geneva to his schedule in the week before Roland Garros. He also played the ATP 250 in Switzerland last year.

The world No 6 reached the quarter-finals at last year's French Open before he was forced to withdraw ahead of his match with Casper Ruud with a meniscus tear. Djokovic won his third French Open title in 2023.

In an interview with Forbes, Evert shared her thoughts on Djokovic's Grand Slam quest ahead of the clay-court major.

“I would never underestimate him, but I would be surprised if he won another major, let's put it that way,” said the 18-time Grand Slam champion and former world No 1.

“I mean, you've got to give the guy credit. This guy's won everything, more than anybody. I would never say he's not going to win, but I would be surprised.

“I would be pleasantly surprised, just with his results in the past and he's human… I'm not feeling it.

“I've seen him play brilliantly on grass, and he's won Wimbledon so many times, that's why I can't say, ‘no, he's not gonna win another one.' I don't think it's gonna be the French Open… but you can never count him out.”

Djokovic recently proclaimed that he still has the desire to achieve more in his career.

“Obviously it's challenging for me nowadays to produce the results I had when I was at my best,” Djokovic told Business Traveler USA.

“It doesn't mean that I will never be able to do that again. But that greatness changes its shape, and that's because you're a different person on an annual basis, on a monthly basis, on a weekly basis.

“Tennis is a sport where it's necessary to nurture that mentality of, ‘It's never enough'. Because once it's enough, then it's really enough and you have to put the racket aside. And I still… I still don't feel it's enough for me.”

ROME - Canada's Bianca Andreescu is through to the fourth round of the Italian Open WTA 1000 tennis tournament after posting a 6-2, 6-4 victory over No. 11 seed Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan on Sunday.

Andreescu, a 24-year-old from Mississauga, Ont., converted three break points and saved five to win the third-round match in one hour 27 minutes.

The 2019 U.S. Open champion is back on the comeback trail after recently returning from nearly six months off the WTA Tour.

Currently ranked 121st, Andreescu earned her first win against a top-20 opponent since 2023 on Friday with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-2 victory against Donna Vekic of Croatia in the second round.

Rybakina hadn't dropped a set in three previous meetings with Andreescu, including a win in the second round of the Madrid Open last month. 

Andreescu will play the winner of a match between No. 8 Qinwen Zheng and No. 26 Magdalena Frech in the next round.

Elsewhere on Sunday, No. 24 seed Leylah Fernandez of Laval, Que., lost her third-round match 6-4, 6-2 to Marta Kostyuk of Ukraine.

Kostyuk hit five aces and converted four break points, compared to one for Fernandez, en route to victory.

Published May 11, 2025

ROME, Italy—It's only her second appearance at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, but Emma Raducanu is starting to feel at home at the Foro Italico as she adapts a “When in Rome” mindset to her post-match meals.“I've started having pasta!” the 2021 US Open champion revealed. “I don't usually eat pasta but in Rome, I have it because I don't feel bad after it. It's quite good quality, as well. I've been having pasta, but no gelato yet.“I love the pomodoro sauce. The tomatoes are so good here, and I love guanciale.”Raducanu certainly earned her amatriciana on Sunday, rallying from a set down to defeat Veronika Kudermetova, 5-7, 6-0, 6-1, and secure a career-best result at a WTA 1000 on clay.

“I always said I think I have the potential to play really well on clay,” she said after her second round. “I don't think I'm there yet but I'm slowly kind of finding my feet. As I kind of use my forehand, use the spin, the serve improves, I think I'll be able to be really good on this surface. One benefit I do have is that I can play with variation and the courts, depending on time of day or opponent, I guess I can use it.“I think now I'm exploring my creativity a bit more on the court,” she added this afternoon. “I think I got very boxed into a certain way of playing, which was aggressive, dominating, feeling like I'm an aggressive baseliner. But I think I have more tools at my disposal, so in practice these days, I've just been kind of messing around with the ball and seeing what I can do, how creative I can be.”Injuries have largely prevented the 22-year-old from ever having a proper clay-court swing, showing flashes of her capabilities on indoor clay—reaching two quarterfinals the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix—but her efforts to become a more all-around player are paying off in Rome, where she'll next face No. 3 seed Coco Gauff for a spot in the quarterfinals.“I love Rome,” she said. “It's a great city with amazing culture. I think if you look around, it's one of the most beautiful places. With my game, I think I'm doing really well here; I'm putting things together a bit more. I think I'm exploring my variety but also, in my first two matches and the third set here, I had good ball speed and my forehand is also doing a lot of damage.”

I think if you look around, it's one of the most beautiful places. With my game, I think I'm doing really well here; I'm putting things together a bit more. I think I'm exploring my variety but also, in my first two matches and the third set here, I had good ball speed and my forehand is also doing a lot of damage.”

World number one Jannik Sinner returned to victorious ways in the second round of the Italian Open after a three-month doping ban.

Sinner defeated Argentina's Mariano Navone 6-3, 6-4 in straight sets.

Earlier this year, Sinner agreed a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency in February and began an immediate three-month suspension after authorities accepted that the anabolic agent clostebol had entered his system via massages from his physiotherapist.

The three-times Grand Slam winner Sinner hasn't played since winning the Australian Open in January. “It's an amazing feeling,” said the 23-year-old. “I waited quite long for this moment. I'm very happy to be back.It's very difficult to have the right feedback when you don't have any matches, and that's exactly what I need. Now I think the best practice is the match itself, so I'm very happy about that.”

Sinner said that there was natural rust but competing again brought him the joy that overrode any doubts about sharpness and rhythm.

“I'm very happy about the win today. It was very difficult. (Navone) is such a great player, especially on this surface. I tried to move around the ball.

“At times it went very well, at times it could have been better, yes, but in any case, it doesn't matter about the result today. It has been a remarkable day for me, so I'm very happy,” Sinner said.

Sinner was also surprised about how good his game felt after the layoff. Talking about his game, Sinner said,”I was surprised how things can (feel good) so quickly. I tried to give everything I have. I think that's the only thing I can do and that's the only thing I can control right now,” Sinner said.

“The sensation felt quite good, to be honest. Of course, there were some ups and downs, that is normal, but (Navone) played some great tennis, especially when he broke me in the second set,” he added further.

After extending his tour-level winning streak to 22 matches, Sinner will next face lucky loser Jesper de Jong.","{'href': 'https://indianexpress.com', 'title': 'The Indian Express'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Fils maintains perfect Tsitsipas record; former Rome champs Medvedev, Zverev advance","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/fils-tsitsipas-rome-2025-sunday","Sun, 11 May 2025 16:02:39 GMT","

Arthur Fils continued his impressive recent ATP Masters 1000 record and his dominance against Stefanos Tsitsipas at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome on Sunday, when he advanced to the fourth round following a high-quality display.

The dynamic Frenchman recovered from a slow start on Grand Stand Arena, where he entertained the crowd with his flashy shotmaking to earn a comeback 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory against Tsitsipas in one hour and 55 minutes.

""I told him at the net he was playing unbelievable in the first set,"" Fils said. ""He was killing me with his forehand, his backhand, at the net. Serving very good. I could not do a lot of things but in the second set I started to find the rhythm and a way to fight and was happy to finish strong in the third.""



Fils played aggressively in the second and third sets, taking large cuts of the ball off both wings to pin Tsitsipas back, while he held his nerve down the closing stage to reach the fourth round at a Masters 1000 event for the fifth time in his past six events.

The 20-year-old, competing at a career-high No. 14 in the PIF ATP Rankings, has often found his best level at Masters 1000 level in 2025, advancing to quarter-finals in Indian Wells, Miami and Monte-Carlo.

At the ATP 500 event in Barcelona last month, Fils reached the semi-finals, moving past Tsitsipas on the way. He now holds a standout 4-0 Lexus ATP Head2Head series record against the former Nitto ATP Finals champion following his latest win.

""If you let him play, I think he is one of the best clay-court players,"" Fils said on Tsitsipas. ""His forehand is a huge weapon. I tried to put him under pressure because if I am not putting him under pressure I am dead.""

Fils is 7-2 against Top 20 players on clay since the start of 2024 and will look to improve that record when he meets the No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings Alexander Zverev in the fourth round. Zverev beat Lithuanian qualifier Vilius Gaubas 6-4, 6-0 in 86 minutes.

""I didn't play my best in the first set but he challenged me... He has won four matches here already, beating quality players like Denis [Shapovalov],"" Zverev said. ""I have huge respect for guys coming through qualifying and guys coming through on Tour. I have been there myself, a long time ago, but I have been there. He is playing great tennis and I am sure we will see more of him.""

The defending champion Zverev, who also triumphed in the Italian capital in 2017, was comfortable throughout his third-round win and has now won his his past nine matches in Rome. The German is seeking his second trophy of the season after winning on home soil in Munich last month.

""In the beginning I felt like it was a bit difficult for me and it was really windy,"" Zverev said. ""The wind really calmed down after the first set and then it was easier for me to get in a rhythm and have clean strokes. I am someone who wants to play with power and doesn't have variety as much, so for me when I am hitting the ball cleanly it is a benefit to me and my game.""






Daniil Medvedev was also an early winner on Day 5 in the Italian capital, where he dispatched Alexei Popyrin 6-4, 6-1.
Medvedev has fond memories in Rome, having lifted the trophy in 2023. Seeking his first title since then, the 10th seed will take confidence from his dominant win against Popyrin.
The 29-year-old saved six of seven break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and committed 16 unforced errors to 28 from Popyrin, who won his maiden Masters 1000 title in Montreal last year.
Medvedev faces Lorenzo Musetti in the fourth round. The Italian recorded his 150th tour-level win with a 6-4, 6-3 victory against Brandon Nakashima.
Musetti is 20-4 on clay since last July, highlighted by winning bronze at the Paris Olympics in 2024 and reaching his first Masters 1000 final in Monte-Carlo in April. Backed by a vocal home crowd on Sunday, Musetti pulled Nakashima from corner to corner with his variety and explosive play.

Three of the four highest-ranked U.S. men fell in their opening matches at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia on Saturday, including world No. 4 Taylor Fritz.A quarterfinalist in Rome a year earlier, Fritz was ousted by countryman Marcos Giron. The 31-year-old prevailed, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (3), despite trailing 4-0 in the second set. For Giron, it marked his second Top 5 victory this season (d. No. 5 Ruud in Indian Wells second round) and first Top 10 win on clay.Fritz, whose European clay swing was delayed until Madrid due an abdominal issue that has plagued him intermittently this season, dropped to 16-8 on the year. An in-form Jack Draper can now overtake the 2024 US Open finalist for the No. 4 seed at Roland Garros by reaching the semifinals here, while Madrid champion Casper Ruud can do the same with another title run. Fritz is due to play the Geneva Open before making his way to the French capital.

Ben Shelton is also in jeopardy of having his seeding notably impacted following his loss to Jaume Munar. The Spainard got the better of the left-hander for the second time in 2025 (Dallas second round), much more convincingly on this occasion with his 6-2, 6-1 dismissal.Munar broke five times while holding in every service game to book a third-round encounter with Sebastian Korda. The No. 22 seed beat Aleksandar Vukic, 6-3, 6-4.Shelton currently sits at No. 12 in the ATP's live rankings, but the likes of Tommy Paul, Arthur Fils and Francisco Cerundolo can bump him down to the Paris major's 13-16 seed group.

“All good,” promised the Frenchman, who earned his sixth Top 20 win of the season.ByDavid KanePublished May 11, 2025 copy_link

Published May 11, 2025

ROME, Italy—The match was over but the battle looked like it was only beginning between Arthur Fils and Stefanos Tsitsipas, who were separated by umpire Gregory Allensworth after Fils clinched a 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 comeback at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia.The dispute ultimately stemmed from a misunderstanding when Fils was tagged at the net by a Tsitsipas passing shot; Fils didn't see the apology given by the former world No. 3.“All good,” insisted Fils, who scored his sixth Top 20 win of the 2025 season. “We're just talking about the match. No worries.”The field may have to start worrying about Fils as the No. 13 seed surged into a career-best result at the Foro Italico. With three Masters quarterfinals already under his belt this season, the 20-year-old has navigated tough opposition to continue his climb up the rankings.

The handshake between Fils and Tsitsipas devolved into a stirring debate, umpire Gregory Allensworth briefly stepping in between the two players.

“Everyone is playing great now on the tour. Of course, Stef is a huge champion; he made the finals of a Slam and everything. When you get to the third round here, you always play a seed, so you know it's going to be a tough match. I played Musetti in Indian Wells, Frances in Miami, Rublev in Monte Carlo. So, it's never an easy match but it's good for me to win them. It helps with my confidence, and it showed me that I'm working great.”Talking more broadly about Sunday's match, FIls described a strong win that helped him improve to 4-0 against Tsitsipas, a 2022 finalist in Rome.“It was tough,” said Fils. “He's a great, great, great player, especially on clay. During the first set, he killed me. I had to find a way. I managed to break at 4-4 with a great game, a bit lucky as well. But I'm very happy with how I finished the match. It was a tough battle, and I finished strong.”

Though Fils, who could face No. 2 seed Alexander Zverev in the fourth round, is poised to return to Paris among the dark horse contenders to win the Coupe des Mousquetaires, the Courcouronnes native is trying not to look too far ahead.“I'm still focused on here,” said Fils. “It's a tough tournament, Rome. It's a Masters 1000 with a lot of points, a lot of great players. Everyone is here. I have to stay focused on this tournament and then I will go to the French Open. Of course, it's always better to play good before the French Open than to play bad.”

Before each day's play at the Foro Italico, we'll preview three must-see matches.BySteve TignorPublished May 11, 2025 copy_link

Published May 11, 2025

This match comes with a strong sense of déja vu. In 2023, Sabalenka won Madrid and arrived in Rome as the WTA's player of the moment. Then she faced Kenin in the second round, and promptly went down to defeat in straight sets. That day, she looked less than fully ready to compete, and Kenin was steady enough to make her pay for it.Two years later, Sabalenka again comes to Rome with a Madrid title in her pocket, as well as the No. 1 ranking. This time, she looked fully prepared for her opening match, which she won 6-2, 6-2 over Anastasia Potapova. After Kenin's ambush of 2023, Sabalenka should be prepared for the American this time as well.Sabalenka leads their head-to-head 3-1, but none of her wins came on clay. Kenin is also a better player than she wa at this time two years ago; she's up to No. 31, and is coming off a runner-up run on green clay in Charleston. All of which will make this an interesting test of how far Sabalenka has come a a player and a professional since 2023. Winner: Sabalenka

The Frenchman and the Greek may be two ships passing in the rankings night. Fils is at a career-high No. 14; that's five spots ahead of Tsitsipas, who not long ago was a perennial Top Tenner and Grand Slam contender.Has the 20-year-old Fils passed the 26-year-old Tsitsipas for good? He already has a 2-0 record against him in completed matches, and his confidence has risen during this clay season. Tsitsipas, meanwhile, took a step back when he lost in the quarters in Monte Carlo, after winning the title there three of the past four years.Fils has the pace from both sides to take advantage of Tsitsipas's weaker one-handed backhand, and he's a match for him when it comes to all-court athleticism. But all may not be lost for Tsitsipas just yet. His 2025 record is the same as Fils's (17-9); he has been a finalist in Rome; and his two losses to Fils came on indoor hard courts, not clay. This is still his best surface. Fils is trying to make it his before Roland Garros. Winner: Tsitsipas

Andreeva wiped the court with Noskova in January, but this has been a competitive head-to-head matchup.ByZachary CohenPublished May 11, 2025 copy_link

Published May 11, 2025

On Sunday, May 11, two of the most talented young players in the sport will collide at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, when Mirra Andreeva takes on Linda Noskova in the Round of 32. Andreeva has been on another level early in her young career. The Russian is the seventh-ranked player in the world, and she has won two 1000-level titles this year. Andreeva also happened to beat Noskova to a pulp in Brisbane earlier in the season, 6-3, 6-0 back in January.Noskova played very poorly in that match, but she won at least one set against Andreeva in their previous two matches. So, has Andreeva leveled up and made this too lopsided of a matchup in terms of skill and talent? Or did Noskova just play a forgettable match in January? The answer is probably somewhere in between, but I think the latter was the more important factor Down Under. So, I'm taking a chance on the Czech to win a set here.

Noskova played very poorly in that match, but she won at least one set against Andreeva in their previous two matches. So, has Andreeva leveled up and made this too lopsided of a matchup in terms of skill and talent? Or did Noskova just play a forgettable match in January? The answer is probably somewhere in between, but I think the latter was the more important factor Down Under. So, I'm taking a chance on the Czech to win a set here.

Noskova is one of the most remarkable ball strikers on the WTA Tour. She has big power from both wings, hits a flat ball and can be deadly accurate when she's on her game. So, for as good of a mover as Andreeva is, Noskova will make life difficult for her if she isn't having an off day. Also, while the slower conditions in Rome will make it harder to get the ball by Andreeva, they'll also give Noskova more time to set her feet and be bold when aiming for targets.I'm also not fully convinced Andreeva is completely healthy right now. She didn't look right in her quarterfinal loss to Coco Gauff in Madrid, where she landed just 59.2% of her first serves and didn't look as confident from the baseline. If Noskova gets a ton of looks at the Andreeva second serve, her eyes will get big and she'll rip her returns. And if Andreeva isn't playing aggressive tennis, she'll have trouble controlling the baseline.This just isn't as straightforward of a match as it might look like when seeing the rankings next to these two players, or the odds attached to the match. Noskova might not be cemented yet, but she's one of the most dangerous players on tour, and has a Top 10 future. This year alone, the Czech has earned wins over Paula Badosa, Donna Vekic, Diana Shnaider and Jessica Pegula. She also pushed Iga Swiatek in a 6-7 (1), 6-4, 6-4 loss in Doha. Her best level allows her to play with anyone, and I think there's a decent shot we'll see some high-level stuff from here in Rome.That, combined with Andreeva being somewhat shaky lately, makes this a match that could go three sets. And I genuinely wouldn't be surprised if Noskova wins.Pick: Noskova +1.5 Sets (-115)

Kimi Antonelli is still just 18 years old, and could still be in school. Instead, he's mixing it with the big names of Grand Prix racing – and already impressing with his speed and composure on track. But just how good has he been since making the step up to Formula 1? Given his tender years, we asked IndyCar star and F1 TV pundit James Hinchcliffe to assess his progress with a quarterly report card on his first season in motor racing's top tier.

After six races and two Sprints, Antonelli finds himself sitting sixth in the Drivers' World Championship, a mere five points off Ferrari front man Charles Leclerc and seven points ahead of Lewis Hamilton, the man he replaced at Mercedes.

READ MORE: Wolff singles out praise for Antonelli as he explains where Mercedes are struggling compared to McLaren

Let's remember that Antonelli has two fewer Grand Prix starts then Leclerc has F1 wins, and one fewer than Hamilton has championship titles! On the face of it, it's been a very impressive start from the young Italian – but let's drill down into the nitty gritty…

Taking into account all the Grand Prix and Sprint Qualifying sessions to date, Antonelli has performed admirably for a rookie. To be fair, when you consider that his team mate George Russell is in the form of his life right now, he has performed admirably for anyone, rookie or not.

Russell dominated Hamilton 24-6 in combined Qualifying last year, and Antonelli already has two notches on the belt courtesy of his unbelievable Miami weekend when he took pole for the Sprint and then P3 for the Grand Prix.

What has impressed me about Antonelli the most is more often than not his lap times improve with each segment. That progression is key for any driver to be a success on Saturdays and he is already showing he can continue to push the limit of the car with each successive Qualifying segment.

For me, he was sitting at a B+ until the Miami weekend where he brought his average qualifying deficit to Russell down from around 0.4 to roughly 0.25, with a Sprint pole to boot!

GHOST CAR: See how Antonelli beat Piastri in the fight for Sprint Pole

This area of his game is more inline with what you'd expect from a rookie – especially considering Russell is performing at an exceptional level at present.

While he has shown a decent ability to manage his tyres – a skill set that is absolutely crucial in this generation of Formula 1 – his ability to maintain front running pace simultaneously is somewhat lacking.

Far from a cause for concern, this is simply an area where experience plays a big part. Look at the jump Oscar Piastri took in this department from year one to year two, and then again in year three.

Antonelli has finished some races only seconds behind Russell (with Japan being particularly impressive given his lack of experience at the track) but having yet to cross the line ahead of his team mate at the flag keeps the grade a bit lower. For now.

Antonelli has been getting closer to Russell

If I had been giving this grade after the Australian GP, it would have been an A+! Some of the moves we saw Antonelli make in mixed conditions were truly breathtaking and showed his maturity in wheel-to-wheel battles.

We haven't seen any messy moments where he has been at fault for needless contact, and his spacial awareness of his car and those around him is excellent. We have seen a few times the pressure of a rival in close pursuit has led to small errors, allowing a position to be lost, but even those are few and far between.

READ MORE: Antonelli taking plenty of positives from Miami weekend despite struggles on way to P6 in the Grand Prix

He is still learning about going wheel-to-wheel with each of his competitors and how to race them given their on-track personalities. This, too, will come with time. His offence seems very dialled-in, with only his defence needing a bit of development.

By far what has impressed me the most about Antonelli is how he has handled the pressure that has come with his new position in the sport.

Stepping into a championship-calibre team, with a team mate operating in peak form – and into the seat of one of the greatest to ever do it – comes with an unimaginable amount of pressure.

I remember the step up to IndyCar from Indy Lights being incredibly daunting. As a driver, you become acutely aware that now, unlike before, every lap of every session is under global scrutiny.

You're trying to learn and better yourself as a driver, but any misstep is now on display to the world. It is a massive adjustment and not an easy one. And that isn't even taking into account the exponential increase in off-track commitments.

Kimi Antonelli already has his first Sprint Pole under his belt

I had the benefit of coming into the series with a smaller team and lower expectations. For Antonelli, that is certainly not the case. He was being touted as the next Verstappen and was replacing Hamilton. Expectations couldn't have been higher. Lesser drivers would have crumbled.

But Antonelli has taken it all in stride, not letting either the good days or bad affect him and his approach in a meaningful way, while maintaining his youthful exuberance and eagerness to improve. He is clearly a hard worker too, and is not letting the thought of being Toto Wolff's cure to missing out on signing Max Verstappen all those years ago distract him from doing what he does best.

READ MORE > PALMER: Why isn't it clicking yet for Lewis Hamilton and Ferrari this year?

This is a short list for a driver with a half dozen races under his belt. The Qualifying deficit to Russell needs to continue to come down, and he is showing every sign that that trend will continue.

More than that, the race management is something that clearly needs improving, from both a pure pace and from a consistency standpoint. The reality is that this comes with experience. It is an impossible thing to practise away from the track, so he simply needs more races to continue his impressive development.

‘It's going to be impressive' – Wolff tips Antonelli to shine when F1 returns to European tracks

It is not lost on me that this might sound almost unfairly harsh for such an inexperienced driver, but such is the type of assessment that comes when the level at which he has performed so far has been so high.

Based on what we've seen out of him over such a short period of time in F1, it's not hard to imagine Antonelli graduating into a World Champion in the not-too-distant future.

“Dad was not only a legendary musician whose artistry touched millions around the world, but also a deeply loved husband, father, uncle and brother,” Rodriguez's daughter, Aubry, shared on social media.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



	Johnny Rodriguez, the chart-topping Hispanic country music star and “That's the Way Love Goes” singer, has died. He was 73. 


	Rodriguez's daughter, Aubry Rodriguez, announced his death on social media on Friday.




	“Dad was not only a legendary musician whose artistry touched millions around the world, but also a deeply loved husband, father, uncle and brother whose warmth, humor, and compassion shaped the lives of all who knew him,” she wrote in an Instagram post. “We are immensely grateful for the outpouring of love and support from fans, colleagues and friends during this time of grief.”

	“While the world has lost an extraordinary talent, we have lost someone irreplaceable — and we ask for privacy as we navigate this painful moment together,” Aubry concluded. 


	Rodriguez was one of the first Hispanic country music stars, finding success at the beginning of his career after moving to Nashville at 21 and signing a deal with Mercury Records. His first single with the label, 1972's “Pass Me By (If You're Only Passing Through),” reached No. 9 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart. 


	His first No. 1 hit on the country charts arrived in 1973 with his track “You Always Come Back to Hurting Me,” with his song “Ridin' My Thumb to Mexico” also reaching No. 1 later that year. 


	Rodriguez's debut album, Introducing Johnny Rodriguez, became a No. 1 album on Billboard's Top Country Albums chart in 1973. That same year, he received the most promising vocalist honor at the Academy of Country Music Awards and was nominated for single record of the year for “Pass Me By.” 


	In total, he had six No. 1 tracks on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, including “That's the Way Love Goes,” “I Just Can't Get Her Out Out of My Mind,” “Just Get Up and Close the Door” and “Love Put a Song in My Heart.”


	He later signed with Epic Records in 1979 and worked alongside producer Billy Sherrill. In 2007, he was inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame. 


	Survivors include his daughter, Aubry, whom Rodriguez shared with his ex-wife, Debbie McNeely.

""I rarely comment on rumors, but my mama and I are too tight for anything to ever come between us,"" the singer wrote.


													By
												

	Ashley Iasimone



Miley Cyrus is putting family first. On the heels of dropping her new single, the ballad “More to Lose,” the singer released a statement on Saturday (May 10) in response to rumors of a rift with parents Tish and Billy Ray.


	“I rarely comment on rumors,” Miley noted in an update shared via Instagram Story on her official account. “But my mama and I are too tight for anything to ever come between us. She's my best friend.”


	“Like a lot of moms, she doesn't know how to work her phone and somehow unfollowed me–simple, coincidental, and uninteresting,” she said, in reference to murmurs that Tish had reportedly unfollowed her on the social media app earlier this week. 

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Her statement continued: “My dad and I have had our challenges over the years. Now, in my thirties, family is my priority above all else. I'm at peace knowing bridges have been built and time has done a lot of healing.”


	“Grateful for the good health and love that flows through my family,” Miley concluded her message.


	Fans had expressed concern about the alleged unfollowing in various comments on Tish's recent Instagram posts, to which she responded that she didn't know she'd apparently unfollowed her daughter. “have no idea how that happened but it's fixed now!” read Tish's reply to one of those comments on Wednesday, May 7. (At press time on Saturday, she follows Miley on Instagram.)


	On Wednesday, Billy Ray had posted a video clip with Miley performing at the piano, along with the caption, “Can't wait to see this young lady. Crazy how time flies.”


	On Friday, he uploaded a snapshot of himself with his son Braison, plus Miley and her boyfriend Maxx Morando, all together in celebration of Braison's birthday. 


	Miley's new song “More to Lose” is off of the imminent album Something Beautiful, a 13-track collection due out on May 30. It'll be the follow-up to 2023's Endless Summer Vacation, which was led by the Grammy-winning, Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 single “Flowers”; Endless Summer Vacation reached No. 3 on the Billboard 200 albums chart.


	“I tried to keep it a singular take,” she shared with fans about recording the emotional track “More to Lose.” “It's really a song that's more of a story, and I never want that to be interrupted or overthought or chasing perfection. I never wanted ‘More to Lose' to be perfect, I wanted it to sound beautiful and emotional.”

	











	During a special evening with Spotify last week, Cyrus gave more insight into Something Beautiful, revealing the album's overarching theme as “beauty, but not what beauty represents by a standard of someone else's idea.” In another sound-bite from the event, she said — to cheers from the audience — “On a scale of, I think, one to gay, how gay is this album? It's not only my best album, but also my gayest.”

EXCLUSIVE: The Crown star Jonathan Pryce has joked that he worries about being barred from America for voicing his full views on Donald Trump‘s vision to slap tariffs on foreign films.


	Speaking to Deadline's Baz Bamigboye on the BAFTA TV Awards red carpet, Pryce said he was planning to visit New York in the coming weeks and did not wish to say “too much” about tariffs.


	“I want to get in easily, I don't want to be sent back,” he laughed. Pryce continued: “The frustrating thing about the tariffs is he [Trump] announces it, panics everybody by not telling them the details. So you've got people in Cannes now trying to do deals and it's going to be impossible until he says exactly what it is and how he is going to police it.”

‘Slow Horses' star and BAFTA TV Supporting Actor nominee Jonathan Pryce on Donald Trump's film tariffs and their effects on the Cannes market: “The frustrating thing about the tariffs is he announces it and panics everybody by not telling them the details” pic.twitter.com/QeBmL9Vk8j


	The Welsh actor was nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the BAFTA TV Awards for his role as David Cartwright in Slow Horses. He said Slow Horses‘ success has been a slow-burner because Apple TV+ did not overpublicize the series and allowed audiences to discover it for themselves.

	Trump has made clear that his shock plans to slap a 100% tariff on film imports would not be included in a trade deal with the UK, where Pryce films Slow Horses. 


	The UK would be particularly vulnerable to any movie tariff, given that the country has established itself as one of Hollywood's top destinations for offshoring shoots, thanks to tax incentives, a skilled workforce, and a shared language.


	Trump's bombshell announcement came in a Truth Social post last weekend, telling followers he planned to apply a tariff to “any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign lands.” The president later said he did not intend to “hurt” the entertainment industry, adding that he intended to meet with studio chiefs to “make sure they're happy.”


	Jon Voight, the Oscar-winner and special ambassador to Hollywood, presented his plan to “make Hollywood great again” to Trump. Deadline got hold of Voight's proposal document, which states that if a U.S.-based production “could have been produced in the U.S., but the producer elects to produce in a foreign country and receives a production tax incentive therefor, a tariff will be placed on that production equal to 120% of the value of the foreign incentive received.”

Rivals actor Danny Dyer says the death of his mentor and champion, Nobel prize-winning playwright Harold Pinter, caused him to suffer a “spiral of madness.”


	Dyer, a longtime familiar face on British TV and film and freshly appreciated for his role in Disney's Rivals, told the BBC's Desert Island Discs radio show that he hadn't spoken to Pinter in a while when he learnt of his death from a newspaper:


	“I did go off the rails for many years and I found out by looking on the front of a newspaper.


	“I'd been on a bender and I was coming home and I was going, I think I was going to buy cigarettes at the petrol garage, and I see it in the paper: ‘Pinter dead'.

	“This really sent me on a spiral of madness, really. The guilt of not being around him any more and just being lost, I was a bit of a lost soul, and again, angry at the world.”


	Dyer added that Pinter had been one of his greatest supporters when he was starting out on his acting career. Dyer even stayed at the older man's home when performing in one of his plays, Celebration, in 2000, and had proved a support when Dyer suffered stagefright and forgot his lines.


	Dyer said of Pinter: “He put his arm around me, and made me feel better about it.”


	In April, Deadline reported that Dyer was developing an idea for a play about his relationship with Pinter, whom he referred to as his “mentor.”

Jessica Gunning keeps coming up gold.


	The British actress has completed what is likely to be a historic TV awards sweep by adding a BAFTA to her collection of prizes for her portrayal of Martha Scott in hit Netflix series Baby Reindeer.


	Gunning won Best Supporting Actress at the BAFTA TV Awards on Sunday, beating competition from five other nominees, including Baby Reindeer co-star Nava Mau.


	Accepting the award, Gunning said she was “so proud” to be part of the series. She also channeled her character Fiona Harvey to wish Richard Gadd happy birthday, exclaiming: “Happy birthday, nipple.”

	“I sometimes do this kind of cheesy thing where I look back on the younger me and moments in my life, and I imagine the kind of then me, seeing me now, and think, ‘little did we know',” she said.




			Watch on Deadline		







	It marks a quadruplet of major wins, having previously clinched an Emmy, Golden Globe, and SAG award. This kind of sweep for one role in the same awards season is incredibly rare, if not unprecedented.


	Matthew Macfadyen won an Emmy, BAFTA, and Golden Globe for Season 4 of Succession, but missed out on an individual prize at SAG.


	Phoebe Waller-Bridge clinched all four for Fleabag, but across two seasons and in different awards seasons. Helen Mirren and Kate Winslet won Emmy, Golden Globe, and SAG awards for Elizabeth I and Mildred Pierce respectively, but both missed out on a BAFTA.


	Gunning has also picked up other prizes over the past year, including at the Critics' Choice Awards, Royal Television Society Awards, and the Broadcasting Press Guild Awards. The breakout year has led to her being picked up by UTA and being cast in Steven Soderbergh‘s comedy The Christophers.


Baby Reindeer was a huge success story for Netflix, with Gunning playing the unsettling former lawyer Martha, who stalks Donny Dunn, portrayed by creator Gadd. The series was billed as a “true story,” which landed Netflix with a lawsuit after Harvey, the real-life Martha, sued the streamer for defamation after she was identified as the character.

	Father-daughter creative duo George Lopez and Mayan Lopez, who co-created and starred in NBC‘s since-canceled Lopez Vs. Lopez, reacted to the semi-autobiographical sitcom's ending, mourning the loss and promising that it marks the “first show” of many more to come.


	Mayan Lopez initially commented on the news via a TikTok, in which she appeared in front of Deadline's article about the cancellation, mouthing to a ditty that sing-songed: “That was rude, that was pretty, f—ing rude.”


	She added in the caption, “So grateful to have created a show from a freaking tik tok that was network for three years… thank you NBC and my cast and crew but right now it's time for tequila and tears… one dream done and now it's the next one.” (The show sparked from a video Mayan Lopez posted while at a treatment center, discussing her reconnection with her father after years of estrangement.)

	George Lopez reposted the video to Instagram, adding in the caption, “We will definitely put something out officially… for now. I would really love to thank all of you who have showed us so much love and support for the past three seasons. This wasn't just a show, it was and is our lives. We created a family. We created jobs for RAZA, there is so much more that goes on behind the scenes and I am forever grateful and thankful for every single member of our #LopezVSLopez familia♥️,” and signing off as “Tio George.”


	Following the news, Mayan Lopez took to social media to share behind-the-scenes clips from set and rehearsal, as well as respond to fans reacting to the show's termination. “If part of the legacy of the show was helping you all be seen and helping you understand your families then I did my job,” she wrote on her Instagram Story in response to a viewer who saw herself in the onscreen father-daughter relationship.


	Mayan Lopez added in an Instagram Story video, “It was three years, I mean the guest stars that we had, the incredible moments for the community and our Latinidad, and it was a beautiful experience and we really were like family, and we always will be.”


	The actress additionally said she is “getting to work and also mourning” and “treating [the cancellation] like a death … I'm grieving.” She also noted that the show aims to “hopefully be picked up somewhere,” though she will provide watchers a sense of “closure” with the unfinished storyline regardless.

	











	In prompting her Instagram followers to ask her questions, she shared that co-star Matt Shively, who plays her onscreen love interest, wrote, “Can we just shoot season 4 on an iPhone in your apartment.”


	Sharing what's next for her, Mayan Lopez pointed to her upcoming guest judge appearance on RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars 10, her forthcoming turn in The Evilry, a podcast, stand-up shows and floated the idea of selling merchandise and penning books, including a memoir.


	“This show was my baby and it took so much out of me personally and professionally being, starring and producing and writing on it. I've done a lot, and I think the next thing I do won't be a version of myself, so it won't take so much out of me. But I'm going to do it all. I'm not worried, it's just going to be when, you know. The industry's in a weird place right now, but I'm going to do what I can,” she said on her Story.


	She continued, “This is just my first show, this is not my last show. I will write movies, I will write TV shows … My dad and I are already talking about working with each other again.”


	Concluding, she added that she will “continue to be a champion for Latino representation, especially with everything going on right now in our country. We are not going to be erased and I hold the pen to make sure we never do.”


	For three seasons, Lopez vs. Lopez followed a working class family through its trials and triumphs, amid dysfunction and reconnection. Co-created alongside Debby Wolfe, it centers on an old-school Latino (George Lopez) who moves in with his Gen Z daughter (Mayan Lopez) as they rebuild their relationship one argument at a time. The series was a return-to-form of sorts for George Lopez, after his hit namesake series ended in 2007, though with a greater degree of vulnerability, tackling real-life issues through the lens of Latinidad, including mental health, machismo and interracial relationships.

Mick Jagger's fiancee Melanie Hamrick has opened up to Us Weekly about their relationship and why she wants to keep it private.

“I think family is so personal, and it's a bubble,” Hamrick, 37, told the publication on May 8, at the NYC Ballet Spring Gala at the David H. Koch Theater in New York City

“It's nice to share things, but it's like the ballet: there needs to be a mystery or people are going to get sick of you,” she confided to Us Weekly.

To Page Six, she gushed, “He's amazing, he really is,” and she joked about the couple's 44-year age gap, saying, “He's younger than me.”

According to Us Weekly, Hamrick is a former ballet dancer. Asked what she wants to keep the most mysterious, she responded, “My private life.”

“I love the Kardashians, however I'm not as comfortable in public,” she continued to the magazine.

Paris Match reported in April that Hamrick “now devotes herself to her son, Deveraux, born in 2016” to her and Jagger.

Hamrick has provided details about her relationship with Jagger in some interviews, though.

According to Paris Match, Hamrick and Jagger have been together for almost 11 years.

She revealed that Jagger had proposed to her several years before the April 2025 interview.

“Maybe one day we'll marry, maybe not,” Hamrick told Paris Match. “We are so happy in our current life that I would be too afraid to change anything.”

According to Us Weekly, Jagger and Hamrick “met in 2014 after a Rolling Stones concert in Tokyo after” after she attended with members of the American Ballet Theatre with complimentary tickets.

Jagger is 44 years older than Hamrick, according to Us Weekly. 

She addressed the age gap to The Sunday Times, saying, “If you think about others' opinions, no matter where you are in life, you're going to have a problem and you're going to analyze it. I put the blinders on. Am I happy? Yes. Are the people in my life happy? Yes. Am I hurting anyone? No. OK, they can mind their own business.”

According to Page Six, Hamrick is no longer performing as a ballerina and is writing novels instead.

Walton Goggins is having a pretty phenomenal year. His much-talked about turn on “The White Lotus” has garnered him affection and disgust in equal measure, with many women around the world left wondering if they might've been the one to “fix him.” He also closed out a legendary four-season run as Baby Billy Freeman on “The Righteous Gemstones,” forever making “Teenjus” part of the common vernacular. Now, ahead of Emmy's voting commencing next month, Goggins took on the penultimate episode of “SNL 50,” a special moment for him considering it was the annual Mother's Day show as well.

 










To celebrate this, Goggins had his own mother join him on stage for a special dance. After explaining how she raised him as a single parent with the assistance of his aunts and other friends, Goggins honored his mother by offering his hand and bringing her up before the audience. Though their dance initially started out as traditional, Goggins and his mother proceeded to show off their Southern roots by kicking off a session of clogging. “Saturday Night Live” isn't typically given the chance to go too sentimental, but when it does, it always manages to remind us of how special the show can be for those able to be a part of it.

Goggins may have needed to rely on the cue cards for most of the night, but he certainly looked like he was having a lot of fun no matter what. Of the live sketches, the best one was the first, which takes the been-there-done-that set-up of the Continental Congress and turns it into a hilarious indictment against our Founding Fathers, who maybe should've been referred to as our Founding Bros. In the bit, Goggins plays an obstructor named Matt who feels the most important amendment next to our right to free speech should simply be “guns.” It's a little hard to laugh at considering how this choice by a small group of men hundreds of years ago continues to wreak havoc on our society, but Goggins and the “SNL” cast's willingness to go there and be as silly as possible in doing so did garner a chuckle or two. 

We love a weird bit and paired with featured player Jane Wickline's odd sensibility, this one might be the strangest we've seen in a while. It starts silly enough with Wickline finding a baby shoe in Central Park that leads her to launch into song. Her hope is to find the baby the shoe belongs to, but instead comes to find that its wearer is a fully-grown man with exceptionally tiny feet. Goggins nails the self-seriousness of this comic character and also gets a boost from best friend Sam Rockwell, who appears as a balloon-salesman with similarly tiny tootsies. 

 










Rumors are abound that this might be Mikey Day's last season at “SNL.” If so, he may be going out on top with one of the most laugh-out-loud moments on Weekend Update in recent memory. Brought on to discuss Trump's tariff chaos, Day is introduced as a “guy who just walked through a spider-web.” This soon comes to define his entire presence rather than the initial purpose of talking about current affairs. Day's physical comedy is on another level and even seemed to get away from the comedian as he was unable to fully remove the shirt he comes to try and rip off. 

Later in the night, we were treated to another Dan Bulla “Midnight Matinee,” which have been popping up frequently this season and always manage to make the mundane utterly unique. This time around, Bulla takes aim at the use of the squatty potty, with Andrew Dismukes playing a recently promoted employee who can't think about anything other than his boss and his wife shitting after seeing the appliance in their bathroom. As a squatty potty user, I feel attacked, but as a fan of “SNL,” I appreciate their ability to find humor in every detail of our existence.

In the waning weeks of 1970, Alice Coltrane put the finishing touches on her latest album, Journey in Satchidananda, recorded in the basement of her Long Island home, in a studio her late husband John Coltrane had conceived, but didn't live to see through to completion. She wrote the album's liner notes and commented on her imminent five-week trip through India and Ceylon (soon to be rechristened Sri Lanka) with her guru, Swami Satchidananda. But for the seekers and yoga students who idealize the spiritual airs of India, the street-level air of the country can be a rude awakening. There's a reason that both meditation and incense originate there, as the sensory overload is profound and pungent. Mindful breathing might include snootfuls of diesel exhaust and frangipani, curry and cow dung, rot and sandalwood. Coltrane's grand-nephew, Flying Lotus, would later describe that scent to me as “the funk of ages” recalling travelling with her there decades later.

And then there was Alice, a tall Black woman from America, amid the bustle of the country, lugging a magnificent harp everywhere. “It was stunning to people there that somebody came from the West to play. She made quite an impression—but she was always very modest,” one student said. A 16 mm film documenting the travels of Satchidananda at that time also offers up the sight of Alice Coltrane—who grew up in the Baptist church in Detroit's Paradise Valley neighborhood—being plunged in the frigid, clear sacred waters of the Ganges River way up in the Himalayas. She would welcome the new year in India. After five weeks there, Coltrane returned to the United States revitalized and reborn.

As she would explain in an interview with Columbia University student radio station WKCR later in 1971: “The past four years have really been involved in that aspect of really trying to see what's going on and finding my place in the spiritual world. So now I feel that I've gotten some answers; I've gotten quite a few answers. There isn't such an urgency as it was before to really go into meditation and spend so many hours in-drawn. Now I feel that I've been given an opportunity to come out, to be with you tonight, to play, and get into music. This is really what I felt from the meditation. Now is the time to really look at music.”

That urgency, those answered answers, that sense of her place in the spiritual world, that deep look at music, all are conveyed in Coltrane's fifth studio album, Universal Consciousness. Composed barely five months after the spiritual jazz masterpiece Journey in Satchidananda, Universal Consciousness is every bit the equal of its predecessor and at times soars even further into stratospheric realms.

It had been a tumultuous, harrowing five years of bereavement for her. She had met the love of her life, John Coltrane, with whom she had three sons (she also had a daughter from a previous marriage). Then, in quick succession, she lost her mother, her father, her husband, and her half-brother. If one wished to perceive the true temporality and impermanence of this life, to get at the true essence of earthly suffering, this would be a surefire way. In the wake of her husband's death in 1967, Alice undertook a severe form of tapasya, an austere spiritual discipline in the Hindu tradition, one that whetted the mind and withered the body. To an outside observer, it was horrifying to bear witness to.

As she would recount years later in her book Monument Eternal, her weight plunged to 95 pounds. She isolated herself in her purple-carpeted bedroom, where even her young children barely saw their mother, meditating upwards of 20 hours a day. Alice was wracked with visual and aural hallucinations. She described looking down to see herself on fire or else realize that she was bleeding, yet not knowing why or how. As she put it: “Marked from head to toe, the greater part of my body resembled the stigmata of a crucified person—blood issued from almost every part of it.”

Yet ever so slowly, Coltrane returned from the brink. An old friend from Detroit suggested she check out the lectures of Satchidananda, then at the height of his fame from delivering the opening benediction at an upstate music festival near Woodstock. She began visiting him at the original Integral Yoga Institute on the Upper West Side in Manhattan and then at his lectures at the nearby Universalist Church on Central Park West. Passage to India would bring this part of her life and spiritual practice full circle.

The seeds for Universal Consciousness were planted there. While traveling through the country, she encountered centuries-old hymns known as bhajans (which would become foundational to her later works). And while Journey had featured the buzzing tamboura of her IYI friend Tulsi Reynolds, she also experienced firsthand recitals that featured sitar, vina, tamboura, harmonium, and the shruti box. She began to envision a sound that wouldn't be reliant on breath or strummed strings. Piano keys attack, but they also decay, thrummed harp strings fade away, and reed instruments briefly go quiet on an inhale to sound the next note. She wanted something that could replicate the feel of the infinite, something that could also exemplify her newfound strength and self-determination. “When we talk, we break, we breathe, we go through all of our human tendencies,” she said. “Things heard from an astral or spiritual place –coming from a spiritual place– does not contain unbrokenness. No breathing, agitation. It's like a perfection, it's pure and unbroken.”

She loved the sustained vibrating “Auuuuuum” that the harmonium imparted, but couldn't quite find its equivalent back home. She tried out one portable organ but it wasn't quite right. Then, in a meditation, “the precise instrument I should get was revealed to me,” she told biographer Franya Berkman. “I could even read the insignia right there on the wood. So I went out to find the Wurlitzer I now have. I didn't need to do any research; it was just conveyed to me.” In the Wurlitzer 805 Centura—fitted with two full-size keyboards and an Orbit III analogue synth on top—she discovered a liquid electricity that could evoke the church organ of her youth in Detroit, the droning waves of Indian music, as well as the strafing fury of her late husband's saxophone runs. While she would utilize a reedman like Frank Lowe on future recording dates, she no longer required the likes of Pharoah Sanders, Archie Shepp, or Joe Henderson on the frontline. All of that fiery sound could be contained within herself now.

And while Journey in Satchidananda eased listeners into her supple soundworld, gently building up from bass, tamboura, and harp to reach sublime heights, with Universal Consciousness, she plunged her audience right into the deep end, no preamble. The opening seconds of the title track couldn't be more bracing. Violins slash and Alice matches that with frenzied harp figures as drummer Jack DeJohnette's skittering hi-hats and snares seek to corral it all. For Universal Consciousness, Coltrane assembled a violin quartet of Joan Kalisch, John Blair, Julius Brand, and Leroy Jenkins, with Ornette Coleman providing the transcriptions. It's a fascinating assemblage of players: Blair and Kalisch were classically trained, while Jenkins made his name as a free jazz player for firebrands like Anthony Braxton and Shepp. But just as you orient yourself amid the onrush, there's a tape splice a minute in and suddenly Alice's Wurlitzer manifests, growling and matching DeJohnette's driving rhythms, the two in a footrace up the side of the Himalayas. When the strings and harp punch back in, it sends the piece even higher. And just as quickly, it halts, leaving you breathless at the top.

If there is an organizing principle to the music, it might be a recreation of the aural hallucinations she experienced from her tapasya, or a glimpse of the spiritual world she now inhabited. The music moves like mercury throughout its brief 36 minutes, never settling for more than a moment. There are two duets with drummer Rashied Ali, her former bandmate in the final Coltrane band. Alice's Wurlitzer suggests the whorls of white-hot energy that her late husband could conjure on his horn. In hindsight, one can draw a straight line from this album to John's freeform saxophone-drum sparring on Interstellar Space, though it would be another three years before the general public heard those duets. The two master players engage in a thrilling give-and-take on “Battle at Armageddon,” a piece Alice described in the liner notes as “this great spiritual battle [that] takes place within the nethermost regions of the human soul, literally, every day.” With some added reverb on her organ at times, you can find yourself drifting in the pitch black of space. Much like the country that inspired this music, it matches the sense of tumult and peace that exist side-by-side.

“Oh Allah” accentuates the interplay between Alice's Wurlitzer and the violins, conveying a preternatural sense of drift. Rather than the four violinists entering en masse, there's a natural fraying to this otherwise elegant sound. The strings switch between a monolithic mass of sound and a tactile messiness that imparts a visceral, live-wire energy. You would never mistake these strings as an attempt at Western classical, a buttoned-up Third Stream experiment, or the kind of sophisticated swinging fare of Charlie Parker With Strings.

The influence of Coltrane's travels in India becomes most apparent on the second side of the album. “Sita Ram,” based on a bhajan chant she heard while there, featured Tulsi's tamboura, with Alice layering little plucked upper register harp filigrees and her incantatory organ atop it. The music seems to breathe, rising and falling in unmetered fashion, an approximation of the amoebic alap section in Indian classical music, with Clifford Jarvis' intermittent snares, bells, and shakers replicating the supple rhythms of the tabla. It would remain in Alice's repertoire, performed in concert and even appearing in a new rendition on her 2004 comeback album, Translinear Light.

By early 1971, “Hare Krishna” was still rarely heard outside of Tompkins Square Park or on the Haight. And while you could recite that chant atop the slow-moving melody when Alice's organ enters, the piece soon soars off into a rarefied air. The violins convey the disembodied sensation of your body cresting over a bank of clouds, with Tulsi's tamboura, Jimmy Garrison's bowed bass, and Alice's organ supporting such flight, making for a sublime eight minutes of untethered sound. Experienced in the right frame of mind, it's a downright transformative piece of music, as breathtaking as anything Alice ever set to tape.

Over 50 years later, Universal Consciousness remains an audacious statement, as white-knuckled on the hundredth listen or your first. There's nothing like it in jazz or classical music, an assured amalgam of the two that is indebted to neither. Alice never settles or falls back into a previous pattern or musical concept. She's restless as a seasoned mountain climber, revealing gorgeous new vistas yet looking ahead to the next peak. Universal Consciousness would be the last album recorded at the Coltrane home studio. Soon, Alice would receive a directive from the Supreme Lord to move to California and establish an ashram there. The music itself became a beacon to those attuned to its message.

A few years after its release, a young spiritual seeker named Purusha Hickson was volunteering at the One Mind Temple, a non-denominational church in San Francisco inspired by John Coltrane's music. One day, while cleaning tables after a free meal service, an album playing in the background at the temple rose to the forefront of his mind. In his book Journey to Turiya, he described the sensation of hearing Universal Consciousness for the first time: “It was otherworldly. Ethereal. Cosmic…Pulsating celestial music flowed from the speakers.” As he gazed upon the photo of Alice Coltrane inside the gatefold, he had a divine realization: He knew that she knew. She was an enlightened being. Within a few months, Hickson would become Coltrane's first student at her ashram. Her time as a jazz musician and famous widow was drawing down as Coltrane pivoted to her new role as a guru. In Universal Consciousness, there's space for all of these lives to co-exist.

Saturday Night Live‘s Weekend Update addressed the election of Robert Prevost as the first American pope, and the subsequent complaints from some conservatives that the Chicago native is somehow “woke.”


Colin Jost began by admitting that, as a Catholic, he “could not be more proud.” 


	“Which is a sin, and now I'm ashamed,” he joked.“The Vatican has selected Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost from the south side of Chicago to be the new pope,” Jost continued, as a photograph showed on screen of Pope Leo XIV waving at the crowd in St. Peter's Square after his ascension Thursday. “You can tell he's from the south side because he's got his hands up.”Jost later turned to MAGA sphere complaints about the new pope having criticized Donald Trump, JD Vance, and the administration's hardline immigration approach.


	“I also love that conservatives are already complaining that this pope is too woke. How woke can a 69-year-old man from Chicago be?” he said. “It's not like he came out and was like, ‘Hey, I'm Pope Leo XIV, he/him.'”


	“The reality is there are no woke catholics,” Jost added. “If you're a woke Catholic, you're just not Catholic anymore.”


	Later in the segment, co-anchor Michael Che riffed on Donald Trump wanting to reopen the federal penitentiary on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay in order to “house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders.”

	Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) traveled to Pennsylvania for a town hall on Saturday to offer Democrats advice on how to build a bigger tent — and perhaps to drum up support for a potential 2028 presidential bid. 


	When an attendee asked Gallego about a fundraiser he held with Marc Andreessen, a billionaire crypto investor and close ally of Donald Trump, the freshman senator stayed on message — framing it as an example of how Democrats should bring more people in the tent. (The fundraiser was first reported by Rolling Stone.)


	“My general view of how to win elections is you have to get a lot of votes, and that means we're going to have to have alliances with people that we may not agree with 100 percent of the time,” said Gallego, stating that “Marc Andreessen runs the largest venture capital firm in Arizona. We want to bring as many jobs as possible.”


	Gallego said he doesn't agree with Andreessen on every issue, pointing to the existence of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which the VC exec accused of “terrorizing financial institutions” after it fined a payday lending company backed by his firm. 

	











	But Gallego added, “My perspective [is] what happened last election is that we got so pure and we kept so pure that we started kicking you out of the tent. It ends up there aren't enough people in the tent to win elections.” 


	Gallego held a $5,000-per-ticket fundraising retreat for his leadership PAC in March, with Andreessen listed as a featured guest speaker. Political blogger Matt Yglesias was also slated to speak at the event, held at the luxury resort L'Auberge de Sedona. 


	The event took place months after Gallego was made the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee's new subcommittee on “digital assets,” created to oversee cryptocurrencies. 


	Andreessen, who advised Trump as he assembled his outwardly pro-crypto administration, and his firm — Andreessen Horowitz — have invested in crypto for years. The firm lobbies extensively on crypto issues.

	Andreessen, the firm, and co-founder Ben Horowitz donated more than $100 million last election cycle to a pro-crypto Super PAC, Fairshake, and its subsidiary Protect Progress. The latter Super PAC spent $10 million boosting Gallego's 2024 Senate campaign.

	











	Andreessen Horowitz has been lobbying on legislation called the GENIUS Act, which would create a new, weak regulatory framework for so-called stablecoins, or crypto assets pegged to actual currencies, like the U.S. dollar. Experts say the legislation would effectively allow Big Tech firms like Amazon, Meta, or X to create their own digital currencies. (Andreessen Horowitz has invested in X, formerly known as Twitter.)

	The GENIUS Act has become more controversial due to the last development in the Trump family's wildly corrupt crypto dealings. Reuters recently reported that a state-backed fund in the United Arab Emirates is making a $2 billion investment using a stablecoin from the Trump family's crypto exchange. 


	Gallego is one of several crypto-friendly Democrats who helped stop the GENIUS Act from advancing in the Senate last week. According to reporting from the American Prospect, it's widely expected these Democrats will ultimately support the legislation.

	Former Saturday Night Live cast member Cecily Strong revived her portrayal of Jeanine Pirro alongside Colin Jost as Pete Hegseth, and the pair of “old drinking buddies” celebrated their reunion.


	The duo, called the “AA team” by Donald Trump (James Austin Johnson), were glad to link up again after their stints at Fox News.


	“I'm so proud to be part of this group full of Russian assets, booze hounds, and people famous for the little baby animals they've killed,” said Pirro, whom Trump had named interim attorney for the District of Columbia.


	Trump said Pirro had the most important quality to him: “she's on TV!”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“I love hiring people from Fox News. They all do an incredible job. Just Look at Pete Hegseth–not one mistake,” he said.


	“No!” Pirro agreed. “He's my old drinking buddy.”


	Jost then entered, surprising Pirro, who sprayed the wine in her mouth all over his face.

	











	When Trump told Hegseth to give an update on the military's F-18 fighter planes, Pirro asked, “Is it bombing the Houthis?”


	“Close. It fell off the aircraft carrier into the ocean,” Hegseth revealed, prompting another wave of wine.


	Trump then wanted to know if Hegseth was maintaining his sobriety, which he had pledged to do if confirmed as Defense Secretary amid concerns about his drinking.


	“I promised I would never have a bottle touch my lips,” he said, giving himself a convenient loophole.


	The Trump administration official removed a bottle of liquor from his jacket pocket.


	“I do have some news to share. Before I do, Jeanine: You want to take a swig of this?” he offered.


	When she dutifully did, Hegseth, a main figure in several controversies over the use of unsecured Signal chats for battle plans, filled her in.

	Amid a widespread crackdown on immigration and refugee programs, the Trump administration is slated to bring white South Africans to the U.S. as refugees on Monday, multiple news outlets reported. They will now have a pathway to American citizenship. 


	The move is the first in a “much larger-scale relocation effort,” White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller told reporters on Friday. The Trump administration suspended the refugee resettlement program on his first day in office for his second term and froze funding for resettlement agencies. In Uganda, as one example, these cuts mean that food rations for a million people have been cut off.


	“What's happening in South Africa fits the textbook definition of why the refugee program was created,” Miller said. “This is race-based persecution. The refugee program is not intended as a solution for global poverty — and historically, it has been used that way.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The Lever first reported the news that white South Africans could be admitted to the U.S. as refugees. 

	











	The U.S. will give about 50 white South Africans help with housing, groceries, and other needs, according to a document reviewed by the Associated Press. The Trump administration could admit as many as 1,000 Afrikaners this year. They will be receiving emergency support from the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is a division of the Department of Health and Human Services.


	In February, the Trump administration issued an executive order that the U.S. would “promote the resettlement of Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination.” The White House also released an executive order saying the U.S. would only admit refugees who “can fully and appropriately assimilate.”


Elon Musk, the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, was born in South Africa. He has said in a post on X that a political group is promoting a “white genocide” in the country, a claim that has been widely denied.

	“Far-right-wing groups in South Africa actively go to America and promulgate this idea of a white genocide because, of course, when you have a high murder rate, white people do get murdered,” Gareth Newham, head of the justice and violence prevention program at the Institute of Security Studies in South Africa told NBC News in February. White people are likely targeted because they are relatively wealthy, he said.

	











	At the root of the Trump administration's claims is South Africa's recent expropriation law that allows the government to seize land under certain circumstances. Thirty years after the end of Apartheid, about seven percent of South Africans are white — mainly descendants of Dutch settlers — but they own almost three quarters of the land. So far, no land has been seized.


	The government of South Africa released a statement Friday saying that the idea that Afrikaners are discriminated against is “unfounded.” 


	“​​It is most regrettable that it appears that the resettlement of South Africans to the United States under the guise of being ‘refugees' is entirely politically motivated and designed to question South Africa's constitutional democracy; a country which has in fact suffered true persecution under Apartheid rule and has worked tirelessly to prevent such levels of discrimination from ever occurring again,” said Chrispin Phiri, spokesperson for the Ministry of International Relations and Cooperation.

	It can often take years to get approval to come to the U.S. as a refugee, but the Afrikaners only had to wait a few months. The status of other refugees is in limbo. Last Monday, a judge ordered the Trump administration to admit 12,000 refugees who had previously been blocked from entering the country. 


	“We are profoundly disturbed that the administration has slammed the door in the face of thousands of other refugees approved by [the Department of Homeland Security] months ago, notwithstanding courts ordering the White House to let many of them in,” Mark Hetfield, the president of HIAS, a Jewish humanitarian aid society, said in a statement. “That's just not right.”

	The Trump administration is getting ready to accept a super luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from the royal family of Qatar to replace Air Force One until Donald Trump‘s second term ends, when ownership of the plane will be shifted to his presidential library foundation, ABC News reported, citing sources familiar with the agreement.


	Trump is scheduled to visit Qatar next week where the gifted plane — which has been described as “a flying palace” worth $400 million — is anticipated to be announced. If the deal goes through, it would be the most expensive gift ever offered to the United States by a foreign government. Trump personally toured the plane in February when it was at West Palm Beach International Airport.


	Reacting to the news, Sen. Chris Murphy posted on social media: “This isn't a good idea even if the plane was being donated to the U.S. government. But Trump GETS TO KEEP THE PLANE??? It's simply a cash payment to Trump in exchange for favors. Just wildly illegal.”

	











	The emoluments clause of the Constitution bars federal officeholders from “accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State” without approval from Congress. But administration lawyers have given the gift the green light.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Per ABC News' sources, Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House Counsel David Warrington determined it is “legally permissible” because the plane will be given on the terms that its ownership will transfer to Trump's presidential library before he leaves office. The idea, however, that it's not Trump's per se seems to be lost on the president. According to a source familiar with the matter, Trump privately refers to the likely gift from the Qatari government as “one of my new big, beautiful planes.”


	The 13-year-old plane will first be given to the U.S. Air Force, which will cover the costs of updating the plane to meet U.S. military specifications necessary to transport the president, ABC News sources familiar with the anticipated arrangement.

	Government lawyers in the White House and Department of Justice decided that the present does not amount to bribery because it is not being gifted on the condition of an official act. Bondi additionally decided that the gift is not bribery because the plane is being given to the Air Force and then to Trump's presidential library rather than to Trump himself.

	











	One reason Trump would want a new aircraft from Qatar is that plans to build a new fleet of Air Force One planes have been delayed and over budget on a $3.9 billion contract. Although a contract was signed with Boeing in 2018 — during Trump's first administration — to build the new fleet, the planes were not expected to be ready to use until 2029, after Trump's second term expires. Trump has asked Elon Musk to help expedite the process.


	While Musk's efforts have moved the delivery date up by two years, Trump is antsy to enjoy a luxurious new Air Force One sometime this year. Enter the Qatari royal family and their “palace in the sky.”


	Concerns about accepting the plane from Qatar include the security ramifications of accepting such a present — one that will not only transport the president but also host sensitive and classified conversations — from a foreign government. The gifted plane also may not be able to perform at the same level as the current Air Force One jets, and the short timeline won't allow for performance modifications.

	“You could do some paint, you could do some communications upgrades, and I suspect it would be hard to do too much beyond that on that timeline,” Andrew Hunter, the Air Force's acquisition under Biden, told The Wall Street Journal earlier this month.


	The Trumps seem to be fostering a close relationship with the Qatari government and royal family. Late last month, the Trump Organization announced it has agreed to build a new Middle East golf course in Qatar in partnership with Qatari Diar, a real estate company created by the nation's sovereign wealth fund. The chair of Qatari Diar is a minister in the government of Qatar.

	In March 2019, a then-Fox News host was sitting quietly, scanning the news, when suddenly their phone rang. They were told to “hold for the president” of the United States, Donald Trump. This Fox host — in an account relayed to Rolling Stone by a person with direct knowledge of the matter — did not know why they were getting this call. They did not have an interview scheduled with Trump. They hadn't requested an off-the-record chat that week. 


	“What could this be about?” the host privately wondered. 


	Within seconds, Trump was on the line, launching into what this source describes as a minutes-long, profanity-laced tirade about how the network's executives were being too “politically correct” and that “liberal” network figures like Rupert Murdoch's children (to be clear, the media mogul's heir, Lachlan Murdoch, is a conservative) were doing a “fucking terrible thing” that needed to be reversed at once. 


	The sitting president — who presumably had other pressing matters to attend to at the time —  encouraged the host, and others, to agitate internally at the right-wing cable news giant to help ensure that this supposed problem be remedied quickly, and to send a message to the Murdoch family. The president, according to the source, was “really worked up” about it.

	











	In the middle of his first presidency, the leader of the free world had carved out time in his schedule so that he could personally call around to Fox News personnel and talent and lobby them to raise hell at the network about the perceived mistreatment of on-air personality “Judge Jeanine” Pirro, a former district attorney, longtime Trump pal, and leading MAGA evangelist. The president was upset about news that Pirro had been quietly suspended by Fox News brass after she had made anti-Muslim comments on-air about Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). 


	And he was doing his part to mount a pressure campaign to run interference for his close friend and political ally, no matter her words or deeds, no matter the level of bigotry.

	“I learned something, which was: Donald Trump will always protect Judge Jeanine,” the source says.


	It wouldn't take long for the suits bring Pirro back to the Fox News airwaves, where she has spent the last six years providing some of her network's most fervently pro-Trump propaganda — including when she helped push lies about the 2020 election in the weeks leading up to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot that Trump instigated. In the days before Trump left office, Pirro lobbied the president to grant a last-minute pardon to her ex-husband, who had been convicted of conspiracy and tax evasion. Trump obliged her as one of his final acts.

	











	Trump, now the president for a second time following the Joe Biden interregnum, never stopped listening to Pirro. He wasn't just an avid viewer of her shows. He regularly talked to her on the phone and invited her for closed-door meetings — both while in and out of office — often to solicit advice on policy and personnel matters, according to current and former Trump administration officials. She almost got a high-ranking job in his first Justice Department during his first administration, while lobbying to become the attorney general. As recently as last year, according to one 2024 Trump campaign official, Trump had privately lamented how some “bad people” who had worked for him as aides managed to talk him out of appointing Pirro during his initial four years in the White House. 


	But last week, Trump once again swooped in to help out his friend “Judge Jeanine” — not simply to get her back on the air at Fox News, but to give her the kind of job he has wanted to give her for nearly a decade now. “I am pleased to announce that Judge Jeanine Pirro will be appointed interim United States Attorney for the District of Columbia,” Trump wrote Thursday night on Truth Social, hours after he said he was removing loyalist Ed Martin from the role, amid a firestorm of Nazi-related controversy.

After one Republican senator publicly balked, he moved on to Pirro, while installing Martin as the director of the ominously titled “Weaponization Working Group,” as well as associate deputy attorney general and pardon attorney. 


	“In addition to her Legal career, Jeanine previously hosted her own Fox News Show, Justice with Judge Jeanine, for ten years, and is currently Co-Host of The Five, one of the Highest Rated Shows on Television,” Trump wrote in announcing Pirro as Martin's replacement, adding that she is “incredibly well-qualified for the position.”


	Martin used his short time as D.C.'s top prosecutor to carry out the president's vendettas, and even referred to himself as “President Trump's lawyer.” Pirro figures to pick up where Martin left off — and then some.


	“She's there to crack skulls,” says a person close to Trump who recently discussed Pirro and the Justice Department with the president, explaining why Trump wanted her as his new top federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C. 


	In his 2024 campaign and during the opening months of his second presidency, Trump has made clear that the key priority of his new administration is to carry out retribution campaigns against his political enemies, including by using the Department of Justice and other agencies as a cudgel against those who cross him. 

	











	For years, Pirro has been publicly calling for the eradication of anti-Trump subversives, real or imagined.

	“There is a cleansing needed in our FBI and Department of Justice,” Pirro said on Fox News all the way back in December 2017. “It needs to be cleansed of individuals who should not just be fired, but who need to be taken out in handcuffs.”


	Now that Trump has installed her at the top of the D.C. attorney's office, Pirro will have the power to see that handcuffs are applied around the wrists of the president's enemies, rather simply crowing about it on cable news.

Scores of internet sleuths are convinced a mysterious US mountain is home to a secret alien base...apparently. Alaska's giant Mount Hayes rises 8,000 feet and is one of the largest peaks in the country. It lies in the icy wilderness and ranks as one of the most prominent peaks in the world.

At a glance, nothing would appear remarkable about it. But the mountain has long been the subject of incredible alien conspiracies thanks to some apparent UFO sightings through the years. Those claims drew such interest, Apple TV is even airing a small series about it titled The Secrets of Mount Hayes.

There's also a a short film on YouTube being aired by the Travel Channel, titled: Searching for UFO's Beneath Mount Hayes.

A trailer for the series starts with an interview with Jonny Enoch, a self-described Paranormal Researcher, who says: ""In my opinion there are unpredictable, dangerous forces at work here.""

So what's really going on there?

According to LadBible, mystery stems from historic CIA documents that incredibly claimed aliens could be operating hidden bases on Earth, that includes deep under the sea and inside remote mountain ranges (and best taken with a pinch of salt, of course).

They were reportedly declassified through the US Freedom of Information Act.

And sensationally, the unassuming Mount Hayes was named among them, along with Monte Perdido in Spain and underwater sites off the coast of Puerto Rico and near the Bahamas.

One report was titled Description of Personnel Associated ET Bases, points to the peak as the ""main base"" used by aliens.

That's because it has been home to some bizarre UFO sightings, with witnesses reporting unexplained aircraft behaving in strange ways.

This was during the 1970s and 80s, a time when the CIA ran experiments with people who claimed they could perceive information about distant objects.

It was part of the CIA's STARGATE program, at a time the US was in a Cold War space race with the Soviet Union (which may explain a lot).

The report adds that one person interviewed said they could remotely see an ""entity"" with a ""very large, round-shaped head"" and a ""very unhuman appearance"" (yes, really).

The sighting was also described as ""very pale"" with a ""sharp nose"". Funnily enough, we can't seem to find any records of this person being drug tested, however.

As crazy as these claims sound, they continue to fascinate UFO hunters.

The verified History Channel, which has 14.5million subscribers, shared one video titled: CIA Analyst Discovers UFO Base in Alaska.

To date, it has 610,000 views.

Another video, titled Does Mount Hayes hold the dark secret to thousands of disappearances? That has 123,000 views.

So while you'd have thought a hidden alien base in a US mountain was something that would have been discovered by now, the mystery continues to live long in the imagination of internet sleuths.

In June, the Turlock Journal put a call-out for readers who were interested in joining a paranormal investigation team at the Groveland Hotel. The response was tremendous; and two local readers were picked to become paranormal investigators-in-training and join the team at the Sept. 23 ghost hunt. 

Readers had two ways to win a spot on the investigation team: writing a winning essay or collecting paranormal questions and answers printed in the Journal and then sending them in with their name and address attached for a random drawing. 

The winner of the random drawing was Karen Reeves of Turlock. She and her guest will be joining the essay contest winner —  Leisa Williams of Turlock and her guest — at the Groveland Hotel.

The Journal would like to thank all those who sent in their essays and paranormal questions and answers. Your enthusiasm was inspiring. All of the essay entries will be published in the Journal's Halloween special section on Oct. 30. The results of the Groveland Hotel investigation — as well as reports on three other local investigations — will also run in the Oct. 30 edition of the Journal.

Below is the winning essay submitted by Williams.



Why I would be a good paranormal investigator

BY LEISA WILLIAMS

Why would I be a good paranormal investigator? 

I could start off by telling you that I have watched most all of the paranormal shows on television  … “Ghost Hunters,” “Ghost Hunters International,” “Ghost Hunters Academy,” “Paranormal State,” “Fact or Faked” (Paranormal Files), “Psychic Kids - Children of the paranormal” … faithfully each week. 

Then I could try to amaze you with the fact that I know what EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena), EMF (Electro Magnetic Field) detector, thermal scan and disembodied voices are. Having this type of knowledge should be to my advantage, right?

The truth is while I have knowledge of what all the equipment is, I have never used any of it before, nor have I ever knowingly set foot in a seemingly haunted location since about the age of 17.  I believe everyone, skeptic or not, at one time or another has considered the paranormal side, but out of fear of being ridiculed, don't vocalize.

  

What makes a good paranormal Investigator?  

I don't think that it is necessarily something you can buy, teach or learn. I believe either you are born with a special gift or it is an experience you have had that leads you to want to find the answers to the many questions it has awakened in you. 

Mine is the latter reason. 

There is a determination to find the truth and to prove to yourself as well as others that yes, this does exist, but while in this course, keeping an open enough mind to be able to process any personal experiences you might encounter or data you might be collecting and try to find alternative reasons for their occurrences. The following is my experience with the paranormal which awakened my curiosity and is the kindling used to help fuel my interest in the paranormal.

At the time that I was 5-years old we lived in what was known as the Marine View Apartments in Ketchikan, Alaska where I shared a room with my two older siblings and my twin sister. My father's younger brother, my Uncle Jerry had just moved out of the apartment leaving free for the taking a bedroom that adjoined with us kids' room. The only way in or out was through our room. 

Not one of us kids would take the room; we all stayed clear of the room. My parents tried to reason with us and tell us “it was just noises from the apartment next door we were hearing” but we all knew better. One night I awoke in the middle of the night and, although my twin sister had climbed down to share my bunk with me, she and the others were all fast asleep. I heard a creek as the door from the empty room opened up into our room. I looked up in time to see that peeking around the end of the door at me was a ghost. It didn't have a form; I couldn't tell if it was a man or a woman, all I know was that it was curious about me. I froze; not knowing what to do. So I did what most 5-year olds would have done … I pulled the covers over my head and squeezed my eyes shut, hoping it would go away, and waited for morning and my family to wake up. That next morning over breakfast I told my parents about my experience but they wrote it off as a dream. I have never forgotten it!   

This past summer while attending a family reunion in Fresno was the first time since I was that scared 5-year old that I have had another encounter with the paranormal. This time it was in a hotel room in the middle of the night with a disembodied voice whispering a message in my ear. 

Was I scared? You bet I was. But as I lay there going through the possibilities of what had just happened, how it could have happened, and working up the courage to check it out, I realized I wasn't afraid of the voice and I knew it meant me no harm. 

The next morning I told my family about my experience. Did they laugh at me and tell me it had to be a dream? You bet they did. Did I listen to their reasoning and contemplate each explanation? Yes I did. Did I let them sway my beliefs? Not one bit. 

So the question remains “Why would I be a good paranormal investigator?”

I believe I would be a good paranormal investigator because my experiences have not only opened  my mind to the possibilities of what is out there, they have also peeked my interest so much that I want to have the opportunity to find out what exactly is out there.

I also have enough sense to realize a lot of people have things happen to them that they believe to be paranormal that actually have rational explanations and would love a chance to help prove or disprove either way.

I work well with others and I am a team player. However, I don't let other peoples' beliefs or opinions become my own. I like to check things out and form my own opinion.

Finally, I feel I am a good people person and when people are going through this type of thing, whether it proves to be real or not — it's real to them and they need to feel that there is someone they can trust who is there for them. I am that person. ","{'href': 'https://www.turlockjournal.com', 'title': 'Turlock Journal'}","other"

A top psychic has revealed exactly why most Australians come to her for advice – and what works 99 per cent of the time.

A psychic has revealed exactly why Australians come to her for advice and what they seek guidance on.

Alla Kuzmis is a Melbourne-based psychic, with her biggest gift being energy reading. She said she didn't need much to be able to connect with spirit guides to receive messages for her clients.

“My opening to any reading is allow me to tell you about you, what you need to work on what you need to let go of and what you mean to acknowledge,” she said.

“I start off without them literally saying a word except hello and I've already had all these messages because of that one interaction on text.”

She said it often surprised her clients, and 99 per cent of the time the message she initially gives them is why they have come to see her. The other one per cent is what the customer needed to hear.

Ms Kuzmis said a lot of the time people come to her to find out when they will get pregnant, or when they will fall in love — essentially addressing any “fear factors” when they deviate outside the “norm”.

She said she offers guidance that other professionals — such as psychologists — can't as she can give advice on topics such as love. She added that these other professionals are much better suited to advise on issues such as anxiety.

“They're not going to say what's going to happen or what kind of person you're dealing with,” she said.

“When you do a reading, you can read into a person's energy and whether they're going to come back into your life. These are the questions people have and you're not going to get that out of a psychologist.”

She said people want an alternative approach to things, and that the majority of her clients were repeat customers. Ms Kuzmis said it was something she really enjoyed because she loved seeing how people's journeys unfolded.

“It's very important that not only are they getting the validation, but that I understand that they're getting exactly what spirit needed them to hear,” she said.

“And I want to see the outcome of it as well. So I never drop anybody. I want to see where it's all heading. I love being part of journey with them.”

One of Ms Kuzmis' clients is Amanda Goff, formerly known as Samantha X. Ms Goff said she has seen psychics for 15 years due to her interest in what happens to people before they die.

“For me personally, it's a fascination with the afterlife and I've always been so compelled to that world,” she said, adding that as she got older that fascination grew.

She also likes the comfort that psychics and mediums give her, being able to go in with a list of questions that she wants answered.

“I remember once a psychic told me years and years ago I'd write books, and I thought, what am I gonna write books about? And then I wrote three books, years later,” she joked.

She recently published Misfit. The unravelling of Samantha X. 

Ms Goff said like with anything she is careful not to be too reliant on psychics, but is understanding that more people are seeking comfort than ever.

“I think more than ever, I think we live in a society that's almost forgetting how to connect with each other,” she said. 

“And we outsource intimacy, we outsourced connection, and we outsource support. And lots of us live on our own, myself included. I know that when I see Alla, I feel all connected.”

Ms Kuzmis said she understands that a lot of people would be sceptical about the work she does, but it is never her job to make a nonbeliever believe as they “may not be ready”.

“I'll be honest with you, a majority of the people who do come, they've already been through quite a journey,” she said.

“There's something that really broke them down. There is something that really hurt them, upset them. It could be a relationship breakdown, some sort of loss. Whatever it is, their soul would have been through something and that's what guided them to get that reading.”

But, for sceptics, she doesn't try to push them to believe as she has no power over them. She said she gets her validation from the people who do see her.

A hallmark of improv is the fact that no one knows what's going to take place onstage until it happens. But what if someone did? “Psyched Out: Improv From the Beyond” may be the closest possible scenario to that truth, as a show finds its laughs by staging scenes based on audience members' psychic readings. Cape Cod psychic Karen Kelly and local improv troupe I Don't Care for This have been collaborating for five years; in June the team-up heads to the fifth annual Boom Chicago Comedy Festival (taking place, surprisingly, in Amsterdam). You'll get scenes based on common topics such as work, travel and love, but there's also the possibility of exploring more ethereal moments with past lives or ghosts. At “Psyched Out,” the future doesn't have to be a mystery – you can see it play out before you. With questionable accuracy, perhaps, but unquestionably filled with laughs. 

“Psyched Out: Improv from the Beyond” at 7 p.m. May 30 at The Rockwell, 255 Elm St., Davis Square, Somerville. $17 to $22.

We're aiming to add 2,500 contributions in the next 30 days, to help keep HinduPost free.

he night of 8th May 2025 will be remembered as the moment Indian PsyOps reached unprecedented scale, culminating in complete & abject surrender of Pakistan's famed 0.5 Front.

On May 8th, while generals slept and bureaucrats refreshed their inboxes, something extraordinary unfolded on X. A psychological warfare storm with no central command. No orders. Just raw, viral momentum that would reshape digital battlefields forever.

Context: India and Pakistan had been trading blows for days. India had successfully damaged Pakistani air defenses in multiple operations, while Pakistan's attempts repeatedly failed. The tension was building to a breaking point.

hen came the night of May 8th. In the physical domain, Pakistan launched 300-400 drones from Leh to Sir Creek, attempting to strike Indian military installations. India responded decisively, destroying four Pakistani military sites & taking down a Pakistani air defence radar.

But as missiles and drones flew in the real world, another arena came alive: Indian X. What followed would become the most decisive digital psychological operation in the subcontinent's modern history.

It began quietly. Among the earliest videos: engineering students at NIT Jalandhar marveling as Indian air defense systems (likely L70 guns) intercepted incoming drones. Their genuine awe and pride set the perfect tone for what was about to unfold.

Then came the flood. Feeds were suddenly alive with footage from border cities – Indian intercepts, Pakistani drones, flashes illuminating the night sky, sirens wailing, fires in Pakistani cities, live updates of firefights near Jaisalmer.

The digital front exploded into a frenzy of fire, sound, and signal. 

The escalation was precise and overwhelming. A video allegedly showing Karachi Port engulfed in flames. Reports of a downed Pakistani AWACS. Claims and pics of captured pilots. Rumors of Navy special operations. Threads suggesting Asim Munir had been arrested with each scroll, the timeline transformed into a war theater.

Every segment of Indian X joined the storm: influencers, meme pages, army fan accounts, anonymous users, verified names. All acting on pure instinct. Claims became viral truths. Images transformed into evidence. Narrative velocity turned into narrative authority.

And then Indian media began picking up information from X, completing the circuit of belief. The loop was locked in. For the average Indian user, this no longer felt like a psychological operation. It felt like witnessing victory in real-time.

Across the border, Pakistan's digital defenses crumbled with startling speed. Their OSINT accounts froze. Troll farms stuttered into silence. Even verified commentators fell mute. Their silence only amplified the belief that something catastrophic had occurred.

The psychological pressure was immense. Pakistan's famed 0.5 Front – their informal information army spread across borders – stopped mocking and started pleading. They didn't just lose control of the narrative; they lost their nerve.

Through their screens, they genuinely believed Pakistan stood on the brink of annihilation. “De-escalate! De-escalate! De-escalate!” The cries echoed across timelines in pure panic. They begged.

They really felt that Pakistan was collapsing, and as a last-ditch effort, they must save it. But their calls were ruthlessly ratioed, mocked, and buried under an avalanche of Indian digital dominance. There was no escape.

The brilliance lay in the natural decentralization. No command center. No chain of authority. Just millions of screens moving with eerie synchronicity. The Indian X Herd wasn't following orders. It was moving as one organism, bound by mutual instinct and shared purpose.

For the first time, Pakistan's favorite tactic – emotional distortion – was turned against them with triple the scale and precision. The psychological shock and awe were total. And they simply couldn't withstand it.

By morning, as the fog of digital war lifted, it became clear that the actual military narrative differed from the overnight frenzy. But the psychological objective had already been achieved: Pakistan's digital defenders had folded in public view.

What collapsed yesterday night was the confidence of an entire propaganda ecosystem. The important question in the air: If they cannot survive a psychological operation, how will they respond to actual kinetic warfare?

The Indian X Herd demonstrated a new kind of power. It seized perception, blurred the line between information and strategic posture, and forced an adversary into visible surrender through sheer narrative dominance.

This was a new form of deterrence. A capability in its own right. A digital force multiplier that can bend reality across borders.

India must recognize and cultivate this asset with strategic vision. The Indian X Herd is not just a mass of users. It is a psychological battalion. A swarm that reshapes timelines. A force that just made an entire hostile ecosystem surrender in full public view.

Remember the night of May 8th, 2025. It wasn't just a digital storm, but the emergence of a new front in modern warfare, where millions of screens, moving as one, created a psychological siege more effective than any conventional weapon.

Post Script: The icing on the cake was the next morning tweets from an official account of Pakistan Economics Affairs and Karachi Port… All Supposedly Hacked.

Conspiracy theories are everywhere, and they can involve just about anything.

People believe false conspiracy theories for a wide range of reasons – including the fact that there are real conspiracies, like efforts by the Sackler family to profit by concealing the addictiveness of oxycontin at the cost of countless American lives.

The extreme consequences of unfounded conspiratorial beliefs could be seen on the staircases of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and in the self-immolation of a protestor outside the courthouse holding the latest Trump trial.

But if hidden forces really are at work in the world, how is someone to know what's really going on?

That's where my research comes in; I'm a social psychologist who studies misleading narratives. Here are some ways to vet a claim you've seen or heard.

Real conspiracies have been confirmed because there was evidence. For instance, in the allegations dating back to the 1990s that tobacco companies knew cigarettes were dangerous and kept that information secret to make money, scientific studies showed problematic links between tobacco and cancer. Court cases unearthed corporate documents with internal memos showing what executives knew and when. Investigative journalists revealed efforts to hide that information. Doctors explained the effects on their patients. Internal whistleblowers sounded the alarm.

But unfounded conspiracy theories reveal their lack of evidence and substitute instead several elements that should be red flags for skeptics:

Dismissing traditional sources of evidence, claiming they are in on the plot.

Claiming that missing information is because someone is hiding it, even though it's common that not all facts are known completely for some time after an event.

Attacking apparent inconsistencies as evidence of lies.

Overinterpreting ambiguity as evidence: A flying object may be unidentified – but that's different from identifying it as an alien spaceship.

Using anecdotes – especially vaguely attributed ones – in place of evidence, such as “people are saying” such-and-such or “my cousin's friend experienced” something.

Attributing knowledge to secret messages that only a select few can grasp – rather than evidence that's plain and clear to all.

Often, a conspiracy theorist presents only evidence that confirms their idea. Rarely do they put their idea to the tests of logic, reasoning and critical thinking.

While they may say they do research, they typically do not apply the scientific method. Specifically, they don't actually try to prove themselves wrong.

So a skeptic can follow the method scientists use when they do research: Think about what evidence would contradict the explanation – and then go looking for that evidence.

Sometimes that effort will yield confirmation that the explanation is correct. And sometimes not. Like a scientist, ask yourself: What would it take for you to believe your perception was wrong?

When theories claim large groups of people are perpetrating wide-ranging activities over a long period of time, that's another red flag.

Confirmed conspiracies typically involve small, isolated groups, like the top echelon of a company or a single terrorist cell. Even the alliance among tobacco companies to hide their products' danger was confined to those at the top, who made decisions and enlisted paid scientists and ad agencies to spread their messages.

False conspiracies tend to implicate wide swaths of people, such as world leaders, mainstream media outlets, the global scientific community, the Hollywood entertainment industry and interconnected government agencies.

The online manifesto of Max Azzarello – the man who self-immolated on the steps of a New York courthouse in April 2024– railed against a conspiracy allegedly including every president since Bill Clinton, sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, even the writers of “The Simpsons.”

Remember that the more people who supposedly know a secret, the harder it is to keep.

Confirmed conspiracies tell stories about why a group of people acted as they did and what they hoped to gain. Dubious conspiracies involve a lot of accusations or just questions without examining what real benefit the conspiracy nets the conspirators, especially when factoring in the costs.

For instance, what purpose would NASA have to lie about the existence of Finland?

Be particularly suspicious when conspiracies allege an “agenda” being perpetrated by an entire sociodemographic, which is often a marginalized group, such as a “gay agenda” or “Muslim agenda.”

Also look to see whether those spreading the conspiracy theories have something to gain. For example, scholarly research has identified the 12 people who are the primary sources of false claims about vaccinations. The researchers also found that those people profit from making those claims.

If you can't figure out who is at the root of a conspiracy allegation and thus how they came to know what they claim, that is another red flag. Some people say they have to remain anonymous because the conspiracists will take revenge for revealing information. But even so, a conspiracy can usually be tracked back to its source – maybe a social media account, even an anonymous one.

Over time, anonymous sources either come forward or are revealed. For instance, years after the Watergate scandal took down Richard Nixon's presidency, a key inside source known as “Deep Throat” was revealed to be Mark Felt, who had been a high-level FBI official in the early 1970s.

Even the notorious “Q” at the heart of the QAnon conspiracy cult has been identified, and not by government investigators chasing leaks of national secrets. Surprise! Q is not the high-level official some people believed.

Reliable sources are transparent.

Some conspiracy theories – though none that have been proven – involve paranormal, alien, demonic or other supernatural forces. People alive in the 1980s and 1990s might remember the public fear that satanic cults were abusing and sacrificing children. That idea never disappeared entirely.

And around the same time, perhaps inspired by the TV series “V,” some Americans began to believe in lizard people. It may seem harmless to keep hoping for evidence of Bigfoot, but the person who detonated a bomb in downtown Nashville on Dec. 25, 2020, apparently believed lizard people ran the Earth.

The closer the conspiracy is to science fiction, the closer it is to just being fiction.

There are other red flags too, like the use of prejudicial tropes about the group allegedly behind the conspiracy, particularly antisemitic allegations.

But rather than doing the work to really examine their conspiratorial beliefs, believers often choose to write off the skeptics as fools or as also being in on it – whatever “it” may be.

Ultimately, that's part of the allure of conspiracy theories. It is easier to dismiss criticism than to admit you might be wrong.

Two studies show major progress in the field of photonic microchips.

Electronic microchips are at the heart of the modern world. They're found in our laptops, our smartphones, our cars and our household appliances. For years, manufacturers have been making them more powerful and efficient, which increases the performance of our electronic devices.

But that trend is now faltering because of the increased cost and complexity of manufacturing chips, as well as performance limits set by the laws of physics. This is happening just as there's a need for increased computing power because of the boom in artificial intelligence (AI).

An alternative to the electronic microchips we currently use are photonic chips. These use light instead of electricity to achieve higher performance. However, photonic chips have not yet taken off due to a number of hurdles. Now, two papers published in Nature address some of these roadblocks, offering essential stepping stones to achieving the computing power required by complex artificial intelligence systems.

By using light (photons) instead of electricity (electrons) for the transport and processing of information, photonic computing promises higher speeds and greater bandwidths with greater efficiency. This is because it does not suffer from the loss of electrical current due to a phenomenon known as resistance, as well as unwanted heat loss from electrical components.

Photonic computing is also particularly suited for performing what are known as matrix multiplications — mathematical operations that are fundamental to AI.

Those are some of the benefits. The challenges, however, are not trivial. In the past, the performance of photonic chips has generally been studied in isolation. But because of the dominance of electronics in modern technology, photonic hardware will need to be integrated with those electronic systems.

Related: AI-designed chips are so weird that 'humans cannot really understand them' — but they perform better than anything we've created

However, converting photons into electrical signals can slow down processing times since light operates at higher speeds. Photonic computing is also based around analogue operations rather than digital ones. This can reduce precision and limit the type of computing tasks that can be carried out.

It's also difficult to scale them up from small prototypes because large-scale photonic circuits cannot currently be fabricated with sufficient accuracy. Photonic computing will require its own software and algorithms, compounding the challenges of integration and compatibility with other technology.

The two new papers in Nature address many of these hurdles. Bo Peng, from Singapore-based company Lightelligence, and colleagues demonstrate a new type of processor for photonic computing called a Photonic Arithmetic Computing Engine (Pace). This processor has a low latency, which means that there is a minimal delay between an input or command and the corresponding response or action by the computer.

The large-scale Pace processor, which has more than 16,000 photonic components, can solve difficult computing tasks, demonstrating the feasibility of the system for real world applications. The processor shows how integration of photonic and electronic hardware, accuracy, and the need for different software and algorithms can be resolved. It also demonstrates that the technology can be scaled up.

This marks a significant development, despite some speed limitations of the current hardware.

—New 'microcomb' chip brings us closer to super accurate, fingertip-sized atomic clocks

—China achieves quantum supremacy claim with new chip 1 quadrillion times faster than the most powerful supercomputers

—Light-powered computer chip can train AI much faster than components powered by electricity

In a separate paper, Nicholas Harris, from California-based company Lightmatter, and colleagues describe a photonic processor that was able to run two AI systems with accuracy similar to those of conventional electronic processors. The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of their photonic processor through generating Shakespeare-like text, accurately classifying movie reviews and playing classic Atari computer games such as Pac-Man.

The platform is also potentially scalable, though in this case limitations of the materials and engineering used curtailed one measure of the processor's speed and its overall computational capabilities.

Both teams suggest that their photonic systems can be part of scalable next generation hardware that can support the use of AI. This would finally make photonics viable, though further refinements will be needed. These will involve the use of more effective materials or designs.

Follow:


            Three energy-rich Gulf Arab nations are racing to turn their influence over Donald Trump into tangible gains with the president set to visit next week.
    


            They have built personal ties with the president and collectively pledged trillions in US investments while casting themselves as key intermediaries in conflicts Trump wants to resolve, from Gaza to Ukraine and Iran.
    


            Now, they're being rewarded with the privilege of hosting Trump's first state visit of his second term. The US president is set to land in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, followed by visits to Qatar and then the United Arab Emirates that stretch till May 16.
    


            Given Trump's transactional approach to foreign policy, the three states have much to offer
    

Ahead of Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East, analyst Firas Maksad looks at the what the U.S. president may accomplish on his trip, and tells Becky Anderson why he thinks the prospect of Saudi-Israeli normalization is dead.

            “In Trump's book, the Gulf states tick all the right boxes,” Hasan Alhasan, senior fellow for Middle East policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Bahrain, told CNN. They “pledge to invest trillions in the US economy and spend colossal amounts on US weapons systems,” he said.
    


            Behind this carefully crafted strategy of wooing Trump is a desire from Gulf states to solidify and formalize their positions as the US' indispensable security and economic partners, and extract as much benefit for themselves as they can.
    


            US-Gulf relations have improved significantly since Trump returned to office. Frustrated at the perceived lack of US interest in their needs under the Biden administration, Saudi Arabia and the UAE had sought to diversify their military, technological and economic ties. With Trump in office, they see what one Gulf official called “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” for to achieve his country's objectives.
    


            From their perspective, now is the time to cement ties with Washington, and even “secure greater privileges in their relationship with the world's most powerful nation,” Ebtesam AlKetbi, founder and president of the Emirates Policy Center think tank in Abu Dhabi, said.
    


            Each of the three nations Trump is visiting has its own list of priorities. Here's what they want from the US and how they're going about achieving it.
    


            “Security, security and security” is what Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states seek most from Trump's visit, said Ali Shihabi, an author and commentator on politics and economics of Saudi Arabia.
    


            “Gulf States are looking for reassurance of the US security commitment to the Gulf's stability,” Shihabi told CNN. “Trump has many priorities and has been known to lose interest quickly… and they want to keep him engaged.”
    


            Last year, the US and Saudi Arabia came close to finalizing a landmark defense and trade pact – but the deal stalled over Saudi insistence that Israel commit to a path toward Palestinian statehood.
    


            Firas Maksad, managing director for the Middle East and North Africa at Eurasia Group, told CNN's Becky Anderson that Trump is likely to move ahead with major deals regardless of normalization, which he said is “dead.”
    


            Riyadh is also seeking US cooperation to develop a civil nuclear program, but that has been held over its insistence on enriching uranium domestically – raising concerns in the US and Israel over nuclear weapons proliferation. Uranium, when enriched to high levels, can be used to produce nuclear weapons.

            White House backing for a Saudi nuclear program could see American firms win lucrative contracts.
    


            Riyadh appears to be framing its relationship with the US as a win-win. In March, Trump said he'd go to Saudi Arabia if it invests $1 trillion in the US. “They've agreed to do that, so I'm going to be going there,” he said.
    


            While Saudi Arabia didn't confirm that figure, it announced plans in January to expand trade and investment with the US by $600 billion over four years, with potential for more.



            But for Riyadh to diversify away from oil, it still needs to sell oil – at a healthy profit – to fund that transition. Recent price drops, driven in part by Trump's tariffs, threaten to undermine those ambitions. Trump has made clear he wants oil prices lower, putting him at odds with Saudi Arabia's need for high revenues to finance its economic transformation.
    


            Perhaps more than any other Gulf state, the UAE sees investment as central to its strategy for deepening ties with the US and securing returns – and it has money to back it up. Among the world's richest countries per capita, it has pledged trillions in US investments. Abu Dhabi has even branded itself “the capital of capital.”
    


            “Expanding trade and investment is a way to reinforce this strategic partnership,” AlKetbi said. “The US remains a critical security guarantor for the Gulf region, while also offering a dynamic economy full of opportunities and capabilities that align with the long-term Gulf development plans.”
    


            In March, the UAE announced a $1.4 trillion investment plan over 10 years focused on AI, semiconductors, manufacturing, and energy. Its existing US investments already total $1 trillion, according to its embassy in Washington.

            “The UAE sees a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to become a significant contributor in AI and advanced technology,” Anwar Gargash, diplomatic adviser to the UAE president, told CNN. “The commitment to invest $1.4 trillion… aligns with the UAE's goal to diversify its economy away from its over reliance on hydrocarbons to ensure prosperity for the country in the future.”
    


            But it won't be easy for Abu Dhabi to achieve its stated goal of becoming a global leader in AI by 2031 without US microchips.
    


            During the final days of former President Joe Biden's administration, the US tightened curbs on AI exports to keep advanced technology out of the hands of foreign adversaries like China, which were meant to take effect on May 15. The UAE has been one of the countries facing restrictions and may expect them to be lifted during Trump's trip.
    


            On Thursday, the US announced that Trump will rescind a set of the Biden-era curbs.
    


            Qatar is the Gulf Arab nation with the most formalized security ties with the US. It hosts the biggest US military installation in the Middle East, which the State Department describes as “indispensable” for US military operations in the region.
    


            Last year, the US quietly reached an agreement that extends its military presence at the sprawling base in Qatar for another 10 years. It also amended a 1992 defense cooperation agreement with the US, which is meant to further strengthen their security partnership.
    


            In 2022, the Biden administration also designated Qatar as a Major Non-NATO Ally, a title granted to close friends that have strategic working relationships with the US military.
    


            Qatar has been a key mediator in a number of conflicts – from the war in Gaza to Afghanistan. Experts say it is part of an effort to remain relevant in the eyes of Washington.
    


            “The Gulf states view conflict mediation as a source of influence and prestige,” Alhasan told CNN. “They have managed to use their role as mediators to position themselves as indispensable partners for Trump's political agenda.”
    


            Doha also maintains close ties with Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, who has been on a quest to relieve his country of years-long sanctions by the West.

            Syria is expected to be a key issue that Qatar will raise with Trump when he visits, an official with knowledge of the matter told CNN Thursday. Doha is pushing the Trump administration to lift sanctions on Syria under the Caesar Act, the official said, adding that Qatar is wary about providing any financial support to Syria without Washington's blessing.
    


            Trump's visit is ultimately about what he can get out of the three Gulf states, experts said, adding that each of the three nations is anticipating a set of new deals that will benefit both parties.
    


            “He's coming here because he believes it is in the interest of the US economy, perhaps his interest and those around him, to have those deals here with Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar,” Maksad said. “So expect big announcements.”

Taiwan ranked 24th globally, first in East Asia and second in the Asia-Pacific region in this year's World Press Freedom Index, released by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) on the eve of World Press Freedom Day, which is observed annually on May 3.

The nation's global ranking moved up three places from the year before, but the improvement was largely due to declines elsewhere. The RSF warned that global press freedom is in a “difficult situation” for the first time since the index began, with 112 countries seeing their overall scores decline.

Taiwan “generally respects the principles of media freedom,” but it has one of the lowest levels of trust in media among democracies, with only a 33 percent trust rate, the RSF said, adding that “structural weaknesses of the Taiwanese media make them particularly vulnerable to disinformation attacks, especially by the Chinese government.”

Taiwan also maintained its status as a “free” county, with a score of 94, ranking sixth globally and second in Asia in the annual Freedom in the World report released by Freedom House in February. However, the organization warned of “the Chinese government's efforts to influence policymaking, media and the democratic infrastructure.”

In sharp contrast, China ranked 178th out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index and was rated “not free” in the Freedom in the World report, with a low score of nine.

Over the past few years, opposition parties in Taiwan have repeatedly disparaged the media in an attempt to undermine their credibility and last year even motioned to cut the entire budget for the state-owned Public Television Service. Many of their supporters also often criticized the media for “scrutinizing the opposition” when they should only “check” the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.

Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) Chairman Eric Chu (朱立倫) last year called the DPP, prosecutors and the media a “trinity” working together against the opposition. Taiwan People's Party (TPP) Chairman Huang Kuo-chang (黃國昌) last year also criticized The Economist over an article about the KMT's and the TPP's efforts to expand legislative power and suggested that people get information from an online forum instead.

The opposition parties accuse the DPP of “politically persecuting” them and suppressing freedom of speech, with Huang earlier this year calling the government “green communists.” Chu this month even called President William Lai (賴清德) a dictator and drew a parallel between Lai's government and the Nazis.

However, the RSF's and the Freedom House's reports show that Taiwan's freedom and press freedom have been improving throughout the years. Structural weaknesses in local media, including political polarization, sensationalism and pursuit of profit might exist, and some outlets might be skewed by foreign interference — particularly from China, as some media groups rely on it for business and investment — but media outlets are being held accountable through several mechanisms and balancing each other by presenting diverse viewpoints and information, so people can still receive well-rounded perspectives on issues.

However, purposely undermining people's trust in the media could be risky and would likely make them more vulnerable to disinformation, as people might turn to social media or content farm Web sites and get biased information. 

The Chinese-language news site The Reporter a few years ago reported that several Facebook groups opposing the government were filled with reposts from content farms, with sources linked to China.

With China's disinformation war attempting to sow discord in the nation, politicians who promote ignorance by weakening people's trust in the news media for partisan gain are risking Taiwan's hard-earned freedom and democracy. Media literacy education is critically needed to counter that threat.



                                                                                US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) were born under the sign of Gemini. Geminis are known for their intelligence, creativity, adaptability and flexibility. It is unlikely, then, that the trade conflict between the US and China would escalate into a catastrophic collision. It is more probable that both sides would seek a way to de-escalate, paving the way for a Trump-Xi summit that allows the global economy some breathing room.
Practically speaking, China and the US have vulnerabilities, and a prolonged trade war would be damaging for both.
In the US, the electoral system means that public opinion                                    



                                                                                In their recent op-ed “Trump Should Rein In Taiwan” in Foreign Policy magazine, Christopher Chivvis and Stephen Wertheim argued that the US should pressure President William Lai (賴清德) to “tone it down” to de-escalate tensions in the Taiwan Strait — as if Taiwan's words are more of a threat to peace than Beijing's actions.
It is an old argument dressed up in new concern: that Washington must rein in Taipei to avoid war. However, this narrative gets it backward. Taiwan is not the problem; China is.
Calls for a so-called “grand bargain” with Beijing — where the US pressures Taiwan into concessions                                    



                                                                                They did it again. For the whole world to see: an image of a Taiwan flag crushed by an industrial press, and the horrifying warning that “it's closer than you think.” All with the seal of authenticity that only a reputable international media outlet can give. The Economist turned what looks like a pastiche of a poster for a grim horror movie into a truth everyone can digest, accept, and use to support exactly the opinion China wants you to have: It is over and done, Taiwan is doomed.

In more general military parlance, the concept refers to an asymmetric capability that targets a critical vulnerability of an adversary. China has found its modern equivalent of the assassin's mace with its high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) weapons, which are nuclear warheads detonated at a high altitude, emitting intense electromagnetic radiation capable of disabling and destroying electronics. 
An assassin's mace weapon possesses two essential characteristics: strategic surprise and the ability to neutralize a core dependency.                                    ","{'href': 'https://www.taipeitimes.com', 'title': 'Taipei Times'}","world"

Pope Leo XIV called for a genuine and just peace in Ukraine and an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, in his first Sunday noon blessing as pontiff that featured some symbolic gestures suggesting a message of unity in a polarized Catholic Church.

“I, too, address the world's great powers by repeating the ever-present call `never again war,'” Leo said from the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica to an estimated 100,000 people below.

It was the first time that Leo had returned to the loggia since he first appeared to the world on Thursday evening following his remarkable election as pope, the first from the United States. Then, too, he delivered a message of peace.

Leo was picking up the papal tradition of offering a Sunday blessing at noon, but with some twists. Whereas his predecessors delivered the greeting from the studio window of the Apostolic Palace, off to the side of the piazza, Leo went to the very centre of the square and the heart of the church.

Part of that was logistics: He didn't have access to the papal apartments in the palace until later Sunday, when they were unsealed for the first time since Pope Francis' death.

Leo also offered a novelty by singing the Regina Caeli prayer, a Latin prayer said during the Easter season which recent popes would usually just recite and harked back to the old Latin Mass of the past.

Traditionalists and conservatives, many of whom felt alienated by Pope Francis' reforms and loose liturgical style, have been looking for gestures and substance from Leo in hopes he will work to heal the divisions that grew in the church. Some have expressed cautious optimism at the very least with a return to a traditional style that Leo exhibited on Thursday night, when he emerged for the first time wearing the formal red cape of the papacy that Francis had eschewed.

He followed up on Saturday by wearing the brocaded papal stole during a visit to a Marian sanctuary south of Rome. There, he knelt in reverence at the altar and greeted the crowd surrounded by priests in long cassocks usually favoured by conservatives.

Aldo Maria Valli, a conservative Italian journalist who writes a popular blog, said he appreciated these gestures and urged traditionalists to give Leo a chance, saying he liked a lot of what he has seen so far. “Don't shoot Leo,” he wrote.

On Sunday Leo wore the simple white cassock of the papacy and had reverted back to wearing his silver pectoral cross. He had worn a more ornate one that contains the relics of St. Augustine and his mother, St. Monica, on Thursday night that had been given to him by his Augustinian religious order.

Leo quoted Pope Francis in denouncing the number of conflicts ravaging the globe today, saying it was a “third world war in pieces.”

“I carry in my heart the sufferings of the beloved Ukrainian people,” he said. “Let everything possible be done to achieve genuine, just and lasting peace as soon as possible.”

As a bishop in Chiclayo, Peru, at the start of Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, then-Bishop Robert Prevost had not minced words in assigning blame to Moscow. According to a clip of a TV interview on the Peruvian show “Weekly Expression,” circulating in Italian media Sunday, Prevost said it was an “imperialist invasion in which Russia wants to conquer territory for reasons of power given Ukraine's strategic location.”

In his remarks Sunday, Leo also called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, and for humanitarian relief to be provided to the “exhausted civilian population and all hostages be freed.”

Leo also noted that Sunday was Mother's Day in many countries and wished all mothers, “including those in heaven” a Happy Mother's Day.

The crowd, filled with marching bands in town for a special Jubilee weekend, erupted in cheers and music as the bells of St. Peter's Basilica tolled.

Angela Gentile of Bari arrived in the square three hours early to be in place. Nonplussed that cardinals had elected yet another non-Italian pope, she said she was happy Leo came to the central balcony of the basilica, so the crowd could see him face-to-face. “What's good for the Holy Spirit works for me,” she said. “I have trust.”

More than 50 pilgrims from Houston, Texas, were in the square, too, waving three large American flags. They were in Rome on a preplanned Holy Year pilgrimage and said they were proud to be part of this historic occasion.

“Words cannot express my admiration and gratitude to God,” said the Rev. Dominic Nguyen, who led the Vietnamese American group. He said he hoped the pope would be happy to see the Stars and Stripes but also Peruvian flags and all other countries, showing the universality of the church.

Also Sunday, Leo celebrated a private Mass near the tomb of St. Peter and prayed at the tombs of several past popes in the grottoes underneath the basilica. Vatican Media filmed him praying before a mix of progressive and tradition-minded popes: Pope Paul VI, who closed out the modernizing reforms of the 1960s Second Vatican Council, and Popes Pius XII and Benedict XVI, on the more conservative end of the spectrum.

He celebrated the intimate Mass with the head of his Augustinian order and his brother, John, in the pews. In his homily, he recalled that Sunday was also the day that the Catholic Church celebrates religious vocations, and noted that the issue of declining vocations had been raised by cardinals in their pre-conclave discussions before his election.

Leo said priests can encourage more vocations by offering a good example, “living the joy of the Gospel, not discouraging others, but rather looking for ways to encourage young people to hear the voice of the Lord and to follow it and to serve in the church.”

Leo also attended the official unsealing of the papal apartments in the Apostolic Palace, which were sealed after Francis' April 21 death. It is unclear if Leo will move into the apartments or just use them for formal audiences as Francis did.

Leo has slept in his old apartment in a Vatican palazzo since his election. Francis decided to live and work at the Domus Santa Marta hotel in the Vatican rather than move into the palace, eventually taking over much of the second floor.

The 69-year-old Chicago-born missionary was elected 267th pope on Thursday. He has a busy week of audiences before his formal installation Mass next Sunday.

Los Angeles-born and Ivy League-educated, Peachy Keenan isn't the typical picture of a pro-natalist.

Yet the married, mother of five is part of a growing movement of mostly Catholic, well-educated women in deep blue California inspired by Donald Trump's calls to have more children.

“To save the country, we need to get out and push the babies out, and to do it in mass scale,” she said.

Ms Keenan, who gave up her job to raise her children, aged eight to 19, added: “When did raising your own baby become this political taboo?”

On the campaign trail, Mr Trump pledged to bring about a “baby boom” to tackle America's ailing birth rate and has since proposed a slew of policies to encourage women to have more children, including paying them.

National fertility rates sat at 1.63 per cent last year, slightly higher than a record low set in 2023, but far below the rate needed for a generation to replace itself.

The fertility drive has been taken up with abandon by members of Mr Trump's cabinet, with Sean Duffy, the transport secretary and a father of nine, suggesting grants be funnelled into communities with higher marriage and birth rates.

His comments echo an agenda pushed by senior Trump allies Elon Musk, a father of 14, and vice-president JD Vance.

Whether it's Mr Musk's six-year-old son, X, sitting on his father's shoulder, or Mr Vance's child patting his parents on the head during the inauguration, the second Trump administration has set a new standard for making children a visible part of day-to-day operations.

When she's not blasting reporters in the briefing room, the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also occasionally brings her nine-month-old son to the office.

“I am deeply proud to support a president and administration so keenly aware of the attack waged against the family in the West today and doing what they can to combat it,” said Isabel Brown, 27, who captioned a picture of herself on social media, cradling her bump with “Project 2025”.

The married content creator and author gave birth to her first child in recent weeks – the first of several, she hopes.

“The Trump administration has started some powerful conversations here in the United States about our fertility crisis,” she said.

“I can tell you that almost all of my friends are currently getting married, are pregnant, or just had their first babies.

“It's an incredibly exciting time to be at the forefront of this fight for the family.”

The goal to supercharge birth rates has created an “unholy alliance” between two wings of the movement, according to Catherine Pakulak, an economist at the Catholic University of America, who is a mother of eight herself.

On one hand, there are pro-family voices such as Mr Vance, who has said he wants “more babies in America”, “not just because they are economically useful. We want more babies because children are good”.

Then there is the pro-natalist wing, led by Mr Musk, who has warned “civilisation is going to crumble” if fertility rates do not climb.

“You talk about it because it excites part of your base. It's clearly the pro-family and pro-life part of the Republican party,” explained Ms Pakulak.

Despite their shared objectives, the two factions' means of achieving their aims could not be more different.

Flag-bearers of the pro-natalist movement Simone and Malcolm Collins, a Pennsylvania former tech-industry couple who have four children through IVF, have grabbed headlines by using genetic screening to select desirable characteristics in their offspring.

Mr Musk has sparked fascination and outrage in equal measure through his efforts to breed a “legion” of offspring, in part by recruiting potential mothers on X, according to The Wall Street Journal.

For many on the pro-natalist wing, the desire to boost the fertility rate is driven by economic concerns.

America's birth rate has been in decline since the early 1970s, and that has accelerated since the 2008 recession and the pandemic.

According to Ms Pakulak, the author of Hannah's Children: The Women Quietly Defying the Birth Dearth, the long-term decline is fuelled by a range of factors, including economic growth and mechanisation, whereby children are no longer needed in the workforce; and improved social security, meaning parents no longer need to rely on their children to take care of them in old age.

The other driving forces are effective contraception, giving women the ability to select when and how many children they want to have; and economic uncertainty.

“When there is uncertainty and distress, people postpone having children, and some fraction of people who postpone will never have that baby,” she explained.

If left unchecked, there are fears the country could end up in a similar position to South Korea or Japan, where a perfect storm of increased life expectancy and a precipitous decline in birth rates to as low as 0.78 has led to economic stagnation, with the shrinking workforce propping up a growing population of retirees.

However, discourse around the issue is often coloured by a more contentious vision: one tainted by ethno-nationalism and fears over immigration.

A $10,000-a-ticket pro-natalist conference in Austin, Texas, last month featured speakers promoting conspiracy theories and, allegedly, eugenics, according to The Daily Wire.

Ms Keenan, who attended this same conference, dismissed these views as belonging to a “tiny fringe” who are not representative of her community.“The women I know who are deciding to have kids have literally no idea about population decline,” she said.

“They're not thinking about it in racial terms. They would find that lens super gross and super offensive.”

Ms Pakulak said: “What seems very difficult is to get people to have kids who don't want them.”

Birth rates aside, many pro-family Trump supporters are chiefly concerned with the decline in family values and view the single-parenting birth factory goals of Mr Musk as anathema to their own.

“I am incredibly sceptical of any proposal that makes children a means to an end,” said Emma Waters, a policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.

And many of those who support the Trump fertility drive remain completely unaware of being part of a political movement.

Elissa Fernandez, 43, a mother of eight from Seattle, said she had never heard of pro-natalism, and never set out to have lots of children, as did Kamiyo Culbertson, 60, a married mother of nine from Washington State.

However, Ms Culbertson welcomed Mr Trump's push for women to have more children.

“It's encouraging to hear,” she said. “I think there's been a leaning the other way – don't get married, don't have kids, that's definitely the story we got from our culture.”

A federal judge in California temporarily blocked the Department of Government Efficiency's bureaucratic overhaul.

A federal judge in California on Friday temporarily blocked what at coalition of labor unions, local governments, and nonprofits argued was “the unconstitutional dismantling of the federal government by the president of the United States on a scale unprecedented in this country's history and in clear excess of his authority.”

Since returning to office in January, U.S. President Donald Trump — aided by his so-callled Department of Government Efficiency and its de facto leader, billionaire Elon Musk — has worked to quickly overhaul the bureaucracy, even though “the president does not possess authority to reorganize, downsize, or otherwise transform the agencies of the federal government, unless and until Congress authorizes such action,” as the coalition's complaint notes.

District Judge Susan Illston agreed with the groups and governments, which include the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Alliance for Retired Americans, Main Street Alliance, Natural Resources Defense Council, the city and county of San Francisco, Chicago, Baltimore, and more.

“The president has the authority to seek changes to executive branch agencies, but he must do so in lawful ways and, in the case of large-scale reorganizations, with the cooperation of the legislative branch,” wrote Illston in a 42-page decision. “Many presidents have sought this cooperation before; many iterations of Congress have provided it. Nothing prevents the president from requesting this cooperation — as he did in his prior term of office.”

“Indeed, the court holds the president likely must request congressional cooperation to order the changes he seeks, and thus issues a temporary restraining order to pause large-scale reductions in force in the meantime,” said the judge, appointed to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California by former President Bill Clinton.

Illston added that “a temporary restraining order is, by definition, temporary. The court will not consider defendants' request for a stay of execution of the temporary restraining order, as doing so would render the exercise pointless. The court must promptly proceed to consideration of a preliminary injunction.”

Welcoming the development in a late Friday statement, the plaintiff coalition said that “the Trump administration's unlawful attempt to reorganize the federal government has thrown agencies into chaos, disrupting critical services provided across our nation.”

“Each of us represents communities deeply invested in the efficiency of the federal government — laying off federal employees and reorganizing government functions haphazardly does not achieve that,” the coalition added. “We are gratified by the court's decision today to pause these harmful actions while our case proceeds.”

The “largest and most significant challenge to Trump's authority to remake the government without congressional approval,” as the coalition called it, was filed April 28 by the organizations' legal team: Democracy Forward, Altshuler Berzon LLP, Protect Democracy, Public Rights Project, and State Democracy Defenders Fund.

Illston's decision came just hours after an emergency hearing, during which coalition attorney Danielle Leonard “said the Trump administration's vision was to fundamentally degrade the services that Congress funds agencies to carry out, raising a profound separation of powers conflict,” according to The New York Times.

As the newspaper detailed:

“There's a presumption of regularity that used to exist with respect to the government's actions that I think they need to re-earn,” she said.

Ms. Leonard said the Trump administration has never been able to point to any specific authority through which the president could seize that power from Congress. And she said that the government has consistently offered competing and contradictory explanations of why Mr. Trump can authorize the massive restructuring without Congress.

“It's an ouroboros: the snake eating its tail,” she said.

Signaling a desire to keep moving through the process swiftly, Illston gave the plaintiff coalition until next Wednesday to file a motion for a preliminary injunction, and the federal defendants — Trump along with various federal agencies and their leaders — until the following Monday to respond, with a limit of 25 pages for both.

Even if the coalition's lawsuit ultimately succeeds, Republicans have a narrow majority in both chambers of Congress, meaning Trump could potentially work with lawmakers to pursue a similar gutting of the federal government before the midterm elections.

At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.
