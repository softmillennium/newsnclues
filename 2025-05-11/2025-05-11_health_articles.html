                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new model of tiny human ovary organoids, or ovaroids, has been developed from stem cells, according to research presented at the first Joint Congress between the European Society of Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) and the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE). This achievement may help to understand and develop treatments for conditions in which these organs do not develop or function properly, including differences in sex development and infertility. During human embryo development, sex determination occurs at a very early stage, making the process difficult to study and understand. Typically, gonads begin to form at about four weeks, and the decision to become testes or ovaries happens at about six weeks. In the past 15 years, a growing number of genes have been implicated in atypical gonad development, but approximately 50% of children with DSDs due to atypical gonad formation still lack a definitive genetic diagnosis. To understand gonad development and disease, researchers from the Institut Pasteur in Paris differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into granulosa-like cells - an ovarian somatic cell type which helps eggs grow and mature - and primordial germ cell-like cells. Next, they combined the two cell populations to form the human ovaroids that replicate key structural and functional aspects of ovarian follicles. While other ovaroid models exist, this is the first time for granulosa-like cells and primordial germ cell-like cells to be generated together, without introducing exogenous transcription factors, to produce organoids. Transcription factors are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences and turn nearby genes on or off, so using external ones can override the innate genetic programme of the cells, which makes the derived populations unsuitable for disease modelling." The team grew somatic gonadal cells with male chromosomes (XY), carrying a genetic variant of a specific gene associated with atypical testis development. As a result, these cells were unable to form three-dimensional tubular structures that resemble the testis cords, leading to a dysgenetic gonad that mimics DSDs. "By creating human-specific, lab-grown models of both testicular and ovarian development using induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), the research overcomes key limitations in the field -particularly the lack of suitable animal models due to poor conservation of developmental genes and mechanisms across species - and provides a powerful platform for studying gene function in a controlled environment,' said Dr. Bashamboo. "Our work more broadly contributes a scalable, human-relevant model system to developmental biology, reproductive medicine and genetic diagnostics. Dr. Bashamboo added: "Our model also opens up new possibilities for screening drugs and environmental toxins affecting human gonads, personalized medicine and future therapeutic interventions."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sumeet Chugh, MD, whose research into sudden cardiac arrest has led to novel methods of predicting the usually fatal condition, has been promoted to vice dean and chief artificial intelligence health research officer at Cedars-Sinai. Chugh was also honored recently with the Heart Rhythm Society's 2025 Distinguished Scientist Award for clinical science. The award was presented April 26 during Heart Rhythm 2025 in San Diego. Eduardo Marb√°n, MD, PhD, executive director of the Smidt Heart Institute, Cedars-Sinai The Distinguished Scientist Award is given to an investigator who has made a lasting impact on patient care and the field of heart rhythm research. "I'm grateful to the Heart Rhythm Society for this recognition of our work and accept it on behalf of my colleagues and mentees at Cedars-Sinai," said Chugh, the Pauline and Harold Price Chair in Cardiac Electrophysiology Research. "Our team is motivated to make a real impact on this deadly condition." According to the American Heart Association, more than 356,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occur each year in the U.S. Nearly 90% of them are fatal. Chugh's team discovered a new method for identifying the best candidates for the implantable defibrillator, a lifesaving intervention. They also combined data from emergency responders, medical records and biological samples to predict imminent sudden cardiac arrest within hours to days of warning symptoms. Their work has improved identification of people at risk and led to the term "near-term prevention" of sudden cardiac arrest. Chugh is also a leader in artificial intelligence research, which he has harnessed to improve prediction of sudden cardiac arrest. In his new role as vice dean and chief artificial intelligence health research officer, Chugh will oversee the translation of AI research into clinical trials and patient care. He will lead the new Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Research Center (AIMRC), which will help departments and institutes incorporate AI into their research. "Dr. Chugh is a foremost investigator in both heart rhythm and AI research," said Jeffrey Golden, MD, executive vice dean for Research and Education at Cedars-Sinai.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How tall your child will be may be decided in the first two years, but it won't tell you when puberty starts. This study sheds light on the lifelong significance of early growth and the limits of its predictive power. Growth patterns during the first two years of a child's life may shape pubertal growth and adult height, but have little effect on pubertal timing, according to research presented at the first Joint Congress between the European Society of Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) and the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE). The findings highlight the importance of early-life growth, which could be used as a marker to predict future growth, development, and health. It is well established that the early-life growth period - from conception to approximately two years - is crucial in determining long-term health outcomes later in life. However, previous research has mainly focused on weight due to its widespread data availability, and the differences in pubertal growth, pubertal timing, and adult height between individuals have not yet been explained by early growth. In this study, researchers from Sweden analysed data on the height measurements, birth characteristics, and parental heights of 4,700 individuals with Nordic ethnicity, born in 1974 and 1990, from the GrowUp Gothenburg cohorts. About 67% of the difference in adult height between individuals was determined by early life, about 67% was by childhood growth, whereas about 60% was attributed to birth size and 37% to the average height of both parents. "Surprisingly, the timing of puberty was not significantly influenced by early-life growth which suggests that, while early-life growth plays a significant role in growth during puberty and in determining final adult height, other factors such as genetics and the environment may be stronger determinants of pubertal timing," said first author Dr Carin Skogastierna from the University of Gothenburg and Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Sweden. Previous studies have also shown similar associations between early-life growth and adult height. However, these associations have never been studied using the QEPS growth model - a model that allowed the researchers to examine specific growth stages separately. "It is important to note that if poor early growth is associated with reduced wellbeing in adolescents and a higher risk of disease and death in adulthood, such findings could further emphasise that healthcare aimed at young children is a good socio-economic investment for society," she added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A large study of nearly a million adolescent boys reveals that late puberty isn't as harmless as once thought, linking it to a sharply higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes in early adulthood. Boys who enter puberty later than average are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes as adults, irrespective of their weight or socio-economic factors, according to research presented at the first Joint Congress between the European Society of Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) and the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE). The findings may uncover a potential new risk factor for boys developing type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes that results from the body's inability to make enough insulin or properly use insulin. Type 2 diabetes - once called adult-onset diabetes - most often develops in people 45 or older, but more and more children, teens, and young adults are now being diagnosed too, and researchers are investigating the various risk factors. In this study, researchers from Israel examined 964,108 Israeli adolescent boys aged 16‚Äì19 years old who were recruited for military service between 1992 and 2015, of whom 4,307 were diagnosed with delayed puberty. They found that adolescent boys with delayed puberty were about 2.5 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes in early adulthood than boys without delayed puberty, even after adjusting for birth year and country, socio-economic status, cognitive function, and education level. In addition, the researchers found that, among teens with delayed puberty, about 140 per 100,000 developed type 2 diabetes each year, whereas only about 41 per 100,000 teens without delayed puberty developed the disease every year. "To our knowledge, our large-scale study is the first to report an association between delayed puberty in adolescent boys and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes," said lead author Professor Orit Pinhas-Hamiel from Sheba Medical Center. She added: "One study suggests a protective association between delayed puberty and type 2 diabetes risk, but it had a low response rate (5.5%) and relied on recall-based anthropometric and pubertal timing data, using voice breaking as a surrogate marker for puberty." "Our results are surprising as delayed puberty is generally considered a benign condition," said Professor Pinhas-Hamiel. "We think the higher risk of early type 2 diabetes in boys with delayed puberty may be due to a window of opportunity during development when the body is especially sensitive to hormones and environmental factors - similar to how early childhood shapes language skills or how puberty affects bone strength." "Our findings contribute to a better understanding of how pubertal timing may influence long-term metabolic health and highlight the need for medical follow-up to enable early diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Recognising delayed puberty in males as an early-life marker for increased risk of type 2 diabetes may help identify vulnerable individuals, allowing for targeted prevention strategies," said Professor Pinhas-Hamiel.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every day, chemicals in toys, soaps, and packaging may be silently reshaping children's reproductive development. Italian researchers link phthalate exposure to measurable changes in genital growth by age three. Three-year-old boys are more likely to have a shorter anogenital distance when their mothers have high levels of phthalates in their urine, according to research presented at the first Joint Congress between the European Society of Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) and the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE). In girls, the direct exposure to phthalates was associated with a shorter anogenital distance. The findings highlight how exposure to environmental pollutants can cause alterations in genital measurements during the first three years of life, which may affect sexual development and fertility later in life. Phthalates are a large group of man-made chemicals widely used in everyday consumer products, such as household cleaners, food packaging, toys, cosmetics, and personal care products. These endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can interfere with our body's natural hormones and could have harmful health effects, including sexual development in children. Anogenital distance - the distance between the anus and genitals - is used as a marker of reproductive health related to hormone levels, lower semen quality, fertility and reproductive disorders. They analysed these samples for eight major phthalate metabolites and found that all of them were detectable in every sample in mothers and children, progressively increasing as time passed. In addition, the researchers found that maternal phthalate exposure impacted only boys, and 3-year-old boys had a shorter anogenital distance. "We were surprised to find such high exposure for those phthalates which are currently less restricted. "Preventive public health measures to protect vulnerable groups are needed." Dr Lucaccioni added: "The eight phthalate metabolites studied in our work can be found in a wide range of everyday products, including toys, make-up products and soaps, among others. The key priority is to check the origin of our daily-use products and implement straightforward protocols to minimise exposure." "Our findings in boys suggest that both prenatal and family environmental exposure may significantly impact their sexual development. For girls, exposure to phthalates may play a role in other hormonal mechanisms. However, our study's sample size is small so we cannot firmly state that there are indeed differences between boys and girls, but we do establish that both may be affected by these endocrine disruptors," said Dr Lucaccioni.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This large-scale study raises red flags about overuse of antibiotics in infancy and its long-term effects on hormonal development. Girls given antibiotics during their first year of life, especially in the first three months, are more likely to enter puberty at an earlier age, according to research presented at the first Joint Congress between the European Society of Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) and the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE). The findings highlight the importance of appropriately using these medicines in infants and how early-life drug exposure could shape future health outcomes. Early puberty, also known as central precocious puberty (CPP), is a condition characterised by the early onset of secondary sexual development in children. Early puberty mainly affects girls and often has no apparent cause, while it is less common in boys. In this study, researchers from Hanyang University Guri Hospital and Hanyang University Medical Center analysed data on the antibiotic intake of 322,731 children, aged 0‚Äì12 months, in South Korea. Additionally, girls who used five or more classes of antibiotics had a 22% increased risk of early puberty compared to those who used two or fewer classes. No association was found between antibiotic intake and early puberty in boys. "This population-based study is one of the first to explore this association between early-life antibiotic use, including the timing, frequency and number of classes, and in such a large national cohort of children," said Dr Yunsoo Choe at Hanyang University Guri Hospital in South Korea, who was involved in the study. Dr Choe added, "In our earlier research, we found that exclusive breastfeeding was associated with a lower risk of central precocious puberty (CPP), supporting the idea that early-life factors affecting the gut microbiome or endocrine-metabolic pathways may influence pubertal development. The current study builds on this by examining antibiotic exposure as a possible modifier of pubertal timing, using a much larger population and more detailed exposure data." "Our results may encourage doctors and parents to consider the long-term effects of antibiotics when making treatment decisions for young children," said Dr Choe. Next, the researchers will explore how early antibiotic use may affect pubertal development and whether repeated or long-term intake during childhood is associated with other aspects of growth, metabolism, or endocrine health. "Our study adds to growing concerns about how antibiotics given in infancy could affect children's long-term development - possibly by altering the gut microbiome or hormonal balance - but the reasons behind it are still unclear," said Dr Choe. "Understanding these biological mechanisms may help guide safer antibiotic use and inform early-life care strategies for children," she concluded.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A major Australian study finds that a child's long-term weight is closely tied to their parents' BMI before birth, especially the mother's, underscoring the urgent need to tackle obesity before pregnancy to break the cycle across generations. New research being presented at this year's European Congress on Obesity (ECO 2025) highlights the need to support women and their families with overweight or obesity to optimise their health and weight before they become pregnant. This was the case regardless of whether the woman took part in a dietary and lifestyle intervention (LI) while pregnant or received standard antenatal care (SC). "Women with overweight or obesity are at increased risk of pregnancy complications, like gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, caesarean birth and high infant birth weight, and for their children to develop obesity," says researcher Professor Jodie Dodd, of the University of Adelaide, South Australia, Australia. "With approximately 50% of women entering pregnancy with overweight or obesity, the trial was carried out to see if changes in diet and physical activity during pregnancy could reduce these risks." The initial results1, published in 2014, showed that infants whose mothers participated in the LI group were 18% less likely to have birth weights above 4kg (8lb 13oz), a known risk for childhood obesity. However, the two groups had no other differences in maternal or birth outcomes, including pregnancy complications. The children were also followed throughout childhood. For the latest study, Professor Dodd and colleagues examined the effect of maternal BMI in early pregnancy on childhood weight and other measures of growth taken at birth and aged 6 months, 18 months, 3-5 years old, and 8-10 years old. They found that a child's growth was linked to its mother's BMI in early pregnancy ‚Äì and that every 5kg/m2 increase in a woman's BMI was associated with an increase in their child's BMI by 0.11kg/m2 at birth, to 0.74kg/m2 at 8-10 years of age. This was the case across the different measures of child growth studied‚ÄîBMI, weight, and their standardised measures. Professor Dodd says: "We know that women living with overweight or obesity are at increased risk of complications like high blood pressure in pregnancy. We also know that lifestyle interventions during pregnancy are ineffective for improving health outcomes for women and their baby/child. "What we found here was that a woman's BMI in early pregnancy impacts how her child grows from birth to 8-10 years of age ‚Äìso, if a woman's BMI is higher going into pregnancy, her child's risk of overweight and obesity increases too. "It's vital that healthcare providers focus on supporting women and their families to optimise their health and weight before pregnancy, if we are to intervene and potentially reduce the intergenerational cycle of obesity."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Could a simple mineral hold the key to solving unexplained male infertility? New findings suggest that phosphate, vital for energy and testicular function, may play a surprising role in sperm health, offering a new angle for treatment. Over the past 50 years, sperm counts worldwide have halved, sperm quality has declined alarmingly, and 15% of all heterosexual couples are facing infertility. However, many factors - genetics, lifestyle, nutritional choices, and hormonal imbalances - can affect men's fertility. For example, in recent years, vitamin D deficiency has been linked with poor semen quality. In this study, researchers from the Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev and the Copenhagen University Rigshospitalet analysed blood and semen samples from 1,242 men with infertility in Denmark. They found that 36% of these men had clinically low levels of phosphate in their blood, as opposed to the approximate 2‚Äì4% incidence seen in the general population in Denmark. Men with moderately low phosphate levels had fewer motile and progressively motile sperm compared to those with normal phosphate levels. Low levels of phosphate were not associated with sperm count. Dr Kafai Yahyavi added, "This could mean that phosphate‚Äîa mineral with known effects on energy production and bone strength‚Äîhas the potential to be targeted directly to improve fertility, possibly by treating some of the infertile men with phosphate supplements." "While our study does not prove that low phosphate concentrations cause infertility, it highlights a potential connection that could be important for understanding and treating male infertility," said Dr Kafai Yahyavi. The team has also previously found that phosphate is essential for testicular function in healthy men, as phosphate concentrations in the seminal fluid are more than 20-fold higher than in the blood, implying phosphate is regulated within the male reproductive system. With this in mind, in another study, also presented at the Joint Congress of ESPE and ESE, Dr Kafai Yahyavi and colleagues investigated this phosphate transport mechanism in rodents and humans and found that high phosphate levels in human semen were associated with higher-quality sperm and increased testosterone levels. "Our study suggests that phosphate levels in the reproductive organs may be important for organ function and sperm function, and we are now searching for regulators of this transport and through them, the influence on male fertility," said first author Ms Zhihui Cui, a PhD student at the Copenhagen University Herlev Hospital. Dr Kafai Yahyavi said, "This is exciting because this transport mechanism now raises the question of whether manipulating phosphate concentrations in the blood will affect fertility.
