                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A short-term pullback may occur as the taker buy-sell ratio drops below one, signaling caution from futures traders. Ethereum's native token Ether (ETH) opened its weekly candle at $1,807 on May 7, and now it is close to recording its highest 7-day returns of 38% since December 2020. Elevated activity at Binance and an uptick in outflows reflect strong trader confidence, liquidity, and sustained bullish momentum in the current market. In a recent X post, veteran trader Peter Brandt highlighted a developing market structure that could pave the way for an Ethereum rally, provided the altcoin breaks through a key "congestion" pattern. Brandt identified a rising wedge formation on the chart—a pattern often considered bearish. However, he suggested that a breakout above this pattern could propel Ethereum's price toward the descending resistance line, targeting a range between $3,800 and $4,800. Nearing its all-time high of $32 billion, this spike reflects heightened market activity and growing trader engagement. The rapid increase in OI signals strong interest in Ether futures, potentially paving the way for increased price volatility. Related: Altseason is coming, 40% daily gains to become ‘new normal' — Analyst Using Fibonacci retracement levels, ETH has retested the 0.5 to 0.618 range (orange box), which aligns with a price level of $2,500. This retest represents the first leg of the recovery, but a short-term pullback may occur before further bullish action unfolds. With ETH prices moving at a parabolic rate over the past few days, liquidation heatmaps noted higher buy-side liquidity between $2,200 and $2,400, after a short-squeeze took prices up to $2,608. Similarly, the taker buy-sell ratio is beginning to slow down and dropped below 1 on May 10. The ratio of buy volume divided by sell volume of takers in perpetual swap trades indicates futures sentiment, and a ratio below 1 implies short-term bearishness.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin rallied within 5% of its previous all-time high, and bulls expect the level to be conquered this week. Bitcoin holds on to its recent gains, increasing the possibility of a retest of the all-time high at $109,588. BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF records 19 days of successive inflows, showing solid demand. Select altcoins are showing strength, having broken out of their large basing patterns. Buyers are trying to hold on to the 10% weekly gains over the weekend. Bitcoin's rally has been backed by solid inflows into the BlackRock spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (IBIT). According to Farside Investors' data, the fund stretched its inflows streak to 19 days, with the latest trading week attracting $1.03 billion in inflows. The rally was not limited to Bitcoin alone, as several altcoins also moved higher. That has prompted analysts to announce the start of an altseason, with some predicting sharp rallies in altcoins over the next few months. However, not everyone believes that an altseason has started because the altcoins have only made modest moves compared to the massive price erosion from their respective all-time highs. Could Bitcoin break out to a new all-time high and maintain it? Bitcoin has been gradually inching toward the all-time high of $109,588, indicating that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits. Any pullback is expected to find support between $100,000 and the 20-day exponential moving average ($96,626). If that happens, the BTC/USDT pair could surge toward $130,000. Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair could plunge to the 50-day simple moving average ($88,962). That enhances the prospects of a breakout above $109,588. Sellers will have to tug the price below $100,000 to weaken the positive momentum. Ether (ETH) skyrocketed from $1,808 on May 8 to $2,600 on May 10, indicating aggressive buying by the bulls. That could result in a range formation between $1,754 and $2,600. A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. That suggests the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate the up move to continue. A deeper correction could begin if the price continues lower and plummets below the 20-EMA. Dogecoin (DOGE) soared above the $0.21 overhead resistance on May 10, indicating a change in the short-term trend. The rally is facing selling at $0.26, which could result in a retest of the breakout level of $0.21. If the price rebounds off $0.21 with strength, it suggests a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. That increases the likelihood of a rally to $0.31. If they do that, the DOGE/USDT pair could swing inside a large range between $0.26 and $0.14 for a while. The pair has turned down from $0.26, with immediate support at $0.22 and then at $0.21. If the price rebounds off the support zone, it suggests a positive sentiment where dips are being purchased. Conversely, a drop below $0.21 signals that the bulls are rushing to the exit. Related: Ethereum to $10K 'can't be ruled out' as ETH price makes sharp gains vs. SOL, XRP Pepe (PEPE) rallied sharply from the 50-day SMA ($0.000008) and broke above the $0.000011 overhead resistance on May 8. This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($0.000009). That could pull the price down to the 20-EMA, which is a vital level to keep an eye on. If they can pull it off, the pair could ascend to $0.000017. Buyers are expected to defend the $0.000011 level with all their might because a slide below it may extend the pullback to the 50-SMA. Cosmos (ATOM) broke out of the large base when it closed above $5.15 on May 10. That signals a potential trend change. However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. Alternatively, if buyers sustain the price above $5.15, the ATOM/USDT pair could pick up momentum and rally to $6.50. Contrarily, a break and close below $5.15 could pull the price down to the 20-EMA. This is an important level to watch out for because a break below it may sink the pair to $4.70.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shiba Inu rose to fame as a meme-powered crypto movement, drawing massive retail attention through community hype and speculative growth. But as market maturity sets in and investor expectations evolve, many Shiba holders are now rethinking their approach. For some, that means looking beyond meme tokens toward infrastructure projects with long-term technical potential. That pivot is increasingly leading them to Bitcoin Solaris, a blockchain platform that pairs high performance with serious architecture — most notably, its dual-layer system capable of processing over 10,000 transactions per second. With energy-efficient consensus, mobile-first mining, and real utility built into the protocol, Bitcoin Solaris is drawing the attention of not just speculators — but analysts, developers, and infrastructure-focused investors alike. The appeal of tokens like Shiba Inu was always based on community and culture, not underlying tech. But after several market cycles, more investors are prioritizing sustainability, accessibility, and real-world application. Bitcoin Solaris provides an answer by delivering a blockchain that solves some of the core limitations meme tokens and even major Layer-1s have yet to overcome: speed, decentralization, and accessible participation. At the heart of Bitcoin Solaris is a dual-layer blockchain that separates security from throughput: Smart contracts can access base data directly, and mining rewards flow across both layers depending on contribution. Technical analysts have taken particular interest in the Helios Consensus Mechanism (HCM), a hybrid protocol that integrates: The combination creates a network that performs under load, avoids centralization, and doesn't rely on high-powered machines. Bitcoin Solaris doesn't just cater to developers or large holders. Through its upcoming Nova App, everyday users can mine directly from their phones. This makes Bitcoin Solaris one of the few Layer-1 blockchains to integrate native mobile mining — offering utility and inclusion far beyond what tokens like SHIB currently support. To see why Bitcoin Solaris is gaining traction among technically focused investors, watch this breakdown by Crypto Volt, which explains architecture, speed, and why this is more than just another L1. The presale is now in Phase 2, with tokens priced at 2 USDT. This structure ensures clean, early access for retail participants — without insider pricing or hidden lockups. For those who demand transparency, Bitcoin Solaris delivers it through independent verification: The codebase, consensus rules, and token allocations are all public. Shiba Inu brought millions into crypto — but the next wave of growth will be led by infrastructure. Bitcoin Solaris offers something meme coins never could: fast, scalable, transparent blockchain technology with real earning mechanisms and on-chain utility. As former meme investors pivot to deeper projects, Bitcoin Solaris stands out as a platform not just built for fun — but built to last.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum's bullish fractals, emerging altseason signals, and strength over SOL, XRP fuel $10,000 ETH price target speculation. Ether has rebounded from key parabolic and triangle support levels, reviving the case for a $10,000 breakout. Ether (ETH), Ethereum's native token, has soared over 44% in just three days to surpass $2,600 on May 11, fueling fresh speculation of a run toward $10,000 in the coming months. Ether's long-term price action continues to follow a parabolic curve that has defined its major market cycles since 2015. Supporting this view, analyst MilkyBull Crypto highlights a similar setup on Ethereum's monthly chart, noting that ETH's rally to $10,000 “can't be ruled out technically.” Chartist Mister Crypto, for instance, argues that altcoins like ETH may rally 40% in a single day amid capital rotation from Bitcoin. The Altcoin Season Index, which has broken out of a downtrend just below the 29 level, signals a potential shift away from Bitcoin dominance. While still in “Bitcoin Season” territory (below 25), the breakout suggests altcoins like ETH may soon begin to outperform. Additionally, Ethereum's top blockchain rival, Solana, is painting a rising wedge pattern against Ether, furthering its potential to decline in the coming weeks. The same picture can be seen against XRP, suggesting that more capital may flow toward Ethereum from rival altcoins in the coming days or weeks. As of May, Ether is reclaiming the lower trendline of its multi-year symmetrical triangle after a brief breakdown in March, while bouncing off its 200-2W exponential moving average (200-2W EMA; the blue wave) support. ETH's rebound confirms a bullish rejection, validating the ongoing consolidation structure. This setup closely resembles ETH's past macro consolidations, namely the 2016 bull flag and the 2018–2020 falling wedge, both of which preceded major breakouts to new all-time highs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why Wall Street Won't Embrace Crypto Without Zero-Knowledge Privacy Howard Wu is the founder of Aleo and CEO of Provable, a company building tools for confidential, compliant payments and developer infrastructure on zero-knowledge blockchains. The views expressed here are his own and do not necessarily represent those of Decrypt. Financial entities, corporations, and sovereign funds would be worse off if sensitive information, such as treasury operations, trading strategies, and quarterly financial movements, became public knowledge. What's needed is a way for these systems to transact confidentially and securely, while demonstrating compliance. Fortunately, a solution has been emerging for some time. Zero-knowledge proofs, a breakthrough in cryptography, offer a way to preserve the open, decentralized nature of blockchains while introducing the confidentiality and control that serious institutions require. This works well for censorship resistance and trustless systems that assume everyone involved is better off with everything out in the open. But for highly regulated organizations or strategically discrete financial entities, this radical transparency becomes a structural weakness. For instance, most banks operate under confidentiality norms enforced by legal contractual obligations, and payment providers must protect user data under existing frameworks. As a result, publicly revealing counterparty exposure or transaction timing can create market manipulation risks and breach fiduciary duties. Similarly, if a government agency used public rails to coordinate emergency aid or military procurement, adversaries could infer national priorities or operational timelines from transaction metadata alone. In both cases, the consequences of an information breach could be economically or strategically catastrophic. Even attempts to “mask” activity using pseudonymous wallets or mixers have proven inadequate. Chain surveillance tools routinely de-anonymize addresses by mapping wallet interactions and analyzing on-chain behavior. In effect, using public blockchains for institutional finance today is like trying to run a business on a public spreadsheet that anyone worldwide can monitor and scrape. Zero-knowledge proofs offer a cryptographic alternative to the binary choice between full transparency and complete opacity. In practical terms, ZKPs enable selective disclosure, meaning institutions can comply with regulatory obligations, such as AML screening or sanctions checks, while still preserving the confidentiality of their operational data. Instead of posting raw data to the chain, they post a proof that certain conditions have been met, which is publicly verifiable without ever exposing a transaction or user's underlying details. Until recently, identity, compliance, solvency, and governance have required disclosure, but with zero-knowledge technology, they require only proof. As a result, institutions no longer have to choose between operational secrecy and on-chain accountability. One of the latest examples is JP Morgan's Kinexys, a private blockchain designed for tokenized cash settlements and interbank messaging. Kinexys allows participants to tokenize assets and execute transactions with confidentiality guarantees enforced at the protocol level. Compliance checks, identity attestations, and settlement proofs can be performed without disclosing underlying business data. When every transaction is visible to the world, businesses and governments face an impossible trade-off between leveraging next-generation financial infrastructure and protecting sensitive information. For the technology to underpin payroll, sovereign reserves, cross-border commerce, and institutional settlement networks, it must evolve to meet the standards of privacy and risk control expected in high-stakes finance. It is the cornerstone of scalable, secure, and compliant finance. If we want the world's leading financial institutions and public entities to embrace digital assets fully, the blockchain industry must meet them where they are, with cryptographic tools that align with how they operate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The rising prices of altcoins have created a surge in interest across the market, with Ethereum's recent performance acting as a catalyst for further growth. However, while Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing a major bull run, Coldware (COLD) is also grabbing attention with its upcoming hardware release — the Larna 2400 mobile device — which could set Coldware apart from its competitors and fuel its growth in the RWA (Real-World Asset) tokenization sector. As Ethereum continues to push the crypto market to new heights, Coldware is taking the next big step in ensuring that decentralized finance and Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization reach a broader audience. The Larna 2400 will empower users to engage with RWA tokenization directly from their mobile devices, making blockchain technology more accessible and usable for everyday applications. By providing users with a secure way to manage and trade assets, Coldware (COLD) is making RWA tokenization more practical and relevant than ever before. Ethereum's price surge has been nothing short of spectacular, crossing the $2,450 mark and drawing attention from institutional investors and retail traders alike. This, coupled with Ethereum's continued dominance, has led many analysts to predict that Ethereum may soon approach its all-time high of $4,864.06. Ethereum's performance and the growing market interest have set the stage for an altcoin season, with many altcoins like Solana (SOL) also gaining significant traction. However, amidst this bullish rally, Coldware (COLD) has positioned itself to stand out with the Larna 2400 mobile device — a revolutionary Web3 hardware release that could significantly impact the landscape of decentralized finance and asset tokenization. While Ethereum's continued success is setting the stage for an altcoin rally, Coldware's Larna 2400 device will play a pivotal role in distinguishing Coldware (COLD) from other players in the market. Coldware's hardware release could complement Ethereum's ongoing advancements, providing a new layer of functionality for blockchain-based finance and asset tokenization. As Ethereum pushes past its previous price highs and other altcoins experience significant growth, Coldware is aligning itself for the future of decentralized finance. The rise of Ethereum has undoubtedly set the tone for 2025, and Coldware (COLD) is poised to ride this wave of momentum. While Ethereum's rise shows no signs of slowing down, Coldware's Web3 hardware release will enable a seamless experience for users to engage in RWA tokenization, positioning it as a leader in this new frontier. As the market continues to evolve, Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself to become a central player in the decentralized finance ecosystem. With its Larna 2400 release on the horizon, Coldware is set to separate itself from other altcoin rivals and become a leader in the space, alongside Ethereum (ETH).

Bitcoin (BTC 0.50%) is up about 25% in the last 30 days alone. It's more likely than not to continue rising, and there's one huge and undeniable reason that makes that the case. So, without further ado, here's why the rest of 2025 is probably going to be a great time for holders. We all look at the performance of our investments. The brokerage websites and applications make it easy to see exactly how your favorite stock or cryptocurrency is performing relative to your cost basis. Conversely, it's fairly easy to continue retaining an investment when it's obvious that your (genius) investment thesis is playing out, as shown by a healthy gain. Upward-climbing charts are, at least psychologically, proof that your gains will continue to grow, whereas tumbling lines on the chart are sufficient to cement your dread that your losses will deepen, prompting you to sell. Putting aside the invalidity of short-term price-based reasoning about whether to buy, hold, or sell an asset, it's undeniable that investors are an emotional bunch that tend not to be able to maintain a long-term mindset about their holdings when faced with the anxiety of experiencing losses. At the same time, when most of the investors who hold an asset are holding it at a gain rather than a loss, incredible things can happen -- and that's exactly what's happening with Bitcoin right now. As of May 5, according to data from Glassnode, a cryptocurrency data provider, at the price of $95,000 per coin, about 88% of all Bitcoin wallets were holding Bitcoin at a gain rather than a loss. And that's the huge reason why it's likely to keep climbing. The overwhelming majority of Bitcoin's holders are not under any emotional pressure to cut their losses whatsoever. It is very unlikely that the price of Bitcoin will trend upward forever solely on the basis of most holders having an unrealized profit this month. There will probably be some macroeconomic events that are able to crack the market's bullish sentiment, causing some investors to sell. In other words, Bitcoin is destined to experience a crash or a sharp fall at some point in the future, and it is very likely that the decline will be so sharp that many investors sell their holdings at a loss and swear off cryptocurrencies altogether. That doesn't detract from the long-term thesis for buying and holding Bitcoin, but it's a fact of life that assets go through cycles of being heavily favored and disfavored. The way to deal with this reality is to have a plan for investing during both the asset's good times and also its hard times. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) with small amounts of capital when the market is practically euphoric about Bitcoin, like now, is a way to make sure you won't get wiped out to the point of feeling bad if there's a decline. At the same time, keeping some of your capital in reserve to buy the dips in the coin's price is also a good idea because doing so will enable you to capture upside when other investors are panicking. The core pillar of this two-handed strategy is to hold your coins for the long term, which in this case means at least four years or so, but preferably closer to 40 years or so. The longer you can diligently accumulate Bitcoin, the more gain you will get from its inherent and ever-escalating scarcity, as well as medium-term drivers like institutional and sovereign adoption. Detach your investing habits from your emotions, and it won't matter how many other investors are holding Bitcoin at a gain or a loss -- you will be taking advantage of its value-generating capabilities all the while, regardless.
