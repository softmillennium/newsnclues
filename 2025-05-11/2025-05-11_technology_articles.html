                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has fired Shira Perlmutter, who leads the U.S. She was appointed by Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, who Trump also fired this week. Trump alluded to the news on his social network Truth Social, when he “ReTruthed” a post from attorney Mike Davis linking to the CBS News article. (In fact, it's actually part three of a longer report.) In it, the Copyright Office says that while it's “not possible to prejudge” the outcome of individual cases, there are limitations on how much AI companies can count on “fair use” as a defense when they train their models on copyrighted content. For example, the report says research and analysis would probably be allowed. “But making commercial use of vast troves of copyrighted works to produce expressive content that competes with them in existing markets, especially where this is accomplished through illegal access, goes beyond established fair use boundaries,” it continues. The Copyright Office goes on to suggest that government intervention “would be premature at this time,” but it expresses hope that “licensing markets” where AI companies pay copyright holders for access to their content “should continue to develop,” adding that “alternative approaches such as extended collective licensing should be considered to address any market failure.” AI companies including OpenAI currently face a number of lawsuits accusing them of copyright infringement, and OpenAI has also called for the U.S. government to codify a copyright strategy that gives AI companies leeway through fair use.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Edit: maybe my information was old - some sources say it costs nothing USB-C is so powerful, it can do everything Bluetooth does while charging, but for some reason that's just not an option in a lot of cars? Part of me thinks the reason they are doing an integrated system is a combination of economics and convenience for 3 letter agencies to remotely assassinate ppl. Basically a Windows that can kill you.They all lost their minds putting stakes on software makers. I intentionally avoid the word engineering, engineering is far far away what is built up by the software making industry that is now tasked with being the babckbone of vechicles you put your and your families life into.

I'm not looking forward to worsening  of all the current bugs with USB audio file playback that cause the UI to hang or not show a fully rendered display. But yea, a single class probably isn't sufficient and also I image a lot of embedded companies have a preference to hire someone already familiar with the chip they are targeting and the toolchain for the stack. I also see a lot of asking for experience with RTOS, which in my class, we didn't use an RTOS. I did some initial requirements work on a system to monitor continuous-web papermaking machinery; the line had to be stopped, physically and completely, within 100ms if anything went wrong, because an uncontained web of paper can literally cut people in half. And they knew their hardware, because they had built it themselves.The absolute last resort is a watchdog timer that hits the reset button if N milliseconds go by without the software telling it it's okay. Sometimes you can get some doco for $ and an NDA, but then in order to get the real doco it is much more $$$ and a much tighter NDA, and the existence of that option is not even divulged until after things have already gone very far south.If it were only a matter of reading the top-level doco for this or that chip, there would be no issue.

This is the level of programmer you're dealing with who's writing embedded software in an overseas sweatshop.

To be fair, im still not sold that this is an advancement except maybe in simplifying the number of components. I'd prefer the car to work without "updates" and DLC. For what it's worth, I work in this industry and the general rule of thumb is that every increase in validation from QM (standard quality) up to the various levels of safety critical code has up to 10x the cost per line of code of the previous level. If the rest of the car can function within design specifications for years, why can't the firmware?I'm fine with updates to add compatibility with new protocols and such, but to me a bug implies there's a standing problem with the current system that's not due to some sort of wear/changing standard/component damage etc. While one can point to examples of cars with defective mechanical designs, I don't think anyone considers it impossible to create designs without such defects (where defects are defined wrt. specifications), why is this the view in software engineering?

Now that all vehicles have entertainment systems connected to the internet, I guess it is tempting to use that to reprogram ECUs, I haven't been working in this area recently though.The first use case of connecting entertainment systems to a vehicle bus that I can remember was to read some engine settings and turn up the volume on the radio at higher speeds.

This feels like a luxury car problem that could be solved over I2C or something.I'm reading this whole SDV thing, and outside of using less ECUs, it seems like an overengineered solution to what was hardly a problem. If we can update ECUs already with OBD-II, step 1 is just making a virtualized OBD-II port that the infotainment system can talk to.

UDS is a dumpster fire of a protocol that should be expunged from existence, but my personal feelings aside can be run anywhere you want. And I don't want to control the rear window defroster, wipers, climate control, fog lights or whatever, on a touch screen menu buried 7 levels deep while going 130 km/h. It's bad enough that coffee makers, light bulbs and tooth brushes now have updatable firmware. Now you can concievably hack all EVs of this model at once and that is now realistic and even attractive to do. The car could be airgapped with the dealer network used to flash software updates like they do with most other cars before EV era.

Sure someone in that situation could also "just cut brakes or put in a pipe bomb" but car theft is a lot more common than assassination, at least where I live. Some unexpected Kierkegaard in there (I only recently learned Dune was referencing it). Because part of me sure does want to learn how to identify cars built like this and learn ways to disable them when I see them parked somewhere around town, before one of them fails to recognize me on my bicycle as something that should be avoided. https://www.slate.auto/enGive me a car that is perfectly 100% autonomous, or give me a car with three gauges and basic controls only.

Until then I like my Nissan Leaf: physical controls, phone just docks with infotainment screen, and reliable. Part of the problem might be poaching high title people from embedded tech companies while not doing anything for developer compensation. I'd probably add that the pay scale for software and electrical/mechanical people probably wasn't notably different in the 90s or so. And California rates didn't compensate for CoL in general.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This seemed inconsistent with Whoop's overall value proposition, where it charges higher subscription prices (ranging $199 to $359 a year) while allowing customers to upgrade their hardware for free. More specifically, it seemed to contradict a statement on the company's website promising users free hardware upgrades if they've been members for at least six months. After customers began complaining, the company responded with a Reddit post both announcing a more expansive upgrade policy and claiming to clarify its overall approach. Now, anyone with more than 12 months remaining on their subscription is eligible for a free upgrade to Whoop 5.0 (or a refund if they've already paid the fee). And customers with less than 12 months can extend their subscription to get the upgrade at no additional cost. There's been a mixed response to these changes on the Whoop subreddit, with one moderator describing it as a “win for the community.” Other posters were more skeptical, with one writing, “You don't publish a policy by accident and keep it up for years. There were also a number of complaints from users who said they had 11 months left on their subscriptions, so they just missed the free upgrade cutoff.

Up for grabs was a free full day to utilize Fugaku however you might want, a ‘Fugaku One-Day Unlimited Ticket.' However, the competition page contains an admission that this is a game “that no one can win” against Fugaku (machine translation). This pales into insignificance vs the supercomputer, though. Fugaku managed to complete 442,010,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 sums during the 10 second battle.

Good news - even if you lost against Fugaku, there were consolation prizes such as a miniature Fugaku to take home (expand the Tweet embedded above to see them). At the Nico Nico Super Conference, which seems to be dominated by tech entertainment phenomena (e.g. VTubers and Cosplay), the Fugaku Face Off is another fun diversion, but with a serious twist. The supercomputer makers remind entrants that Fugaku, and its brethren, are used for tasks like research on disaster prevention – flood damage simulation, optimal evacuation plans, and so on. Fugaku, currently ranked sixth place in the TOP500 supercomputer list, delivers 442 PFlop/s of compute. The last time we reported on Fugaku, was a story largely about its successor. The collaborative work between RIKEN and Fujitsu should start this year and the goal is to deliver a ZetaFLOPS-scale supercomputer by 2030.

There have always been two major issues with 3D displays: No one wants to wear 3D glasses, and there has never been enough content to take advantage of the technology. Samsung's new Odyssey 3D monitor (G90XF) wants to solve these problems in one fell swoop. While that can be true of other important monitor technologies, whether it's resolution, refresh rate, or HDR, 3D is something everyone will want to try at least once. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The recommended distance is between 27 and 40 inches, which gives you lots of wiggle room to get comfortable. That's a big step forward from where this technology was just a few years ago, though there are still limitations. You can't have multiple people in front of the monitor at once, and there are both resolution and PC hardware requirements to be aware of. You have to play the game at full-screen in native resolution, and you'll need at least an Nvidia RTX 3070 graphics card. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. There are a couple of popular games like Palworld and Stray, but they also include several lesser-known kids' games like The Smurfs: Dreams and SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake. Only The First Berserker: Khazan is labeled as a “co-developed” title. Samsung promises that there will be 11 more of these “co-developed” releases by the end of the year and as many as 50 generally compatible 3D games. While that's a good on-ramp, Samsung is attempting to catch up with the vast library of compatible titles in Acer's SpatialLabs ecosystem in support of its Predator SpatialLabs View 27 and other 3D display products. Acer has been building that library for years, so there's a large, notable disparity. At the very least, Samsung should be selling this bundled with a free copy of that game, given the highly limited game selection. It's a gorgeous monitor, using a silver chassis similar to the ones on other Odyssey monitors I've enjoyed. While it's an experimental concept monitor for gamers, Samsung has done a fantastic job of making it appear like a standard screen. Yes, it has a wide stand and a large top bezel for its eye-tracking cameras, but other than that, you wouldn't assume this is an early-adopter product. That's unlike the aforementioned Acer Predator SpatialLabs View 27, which doesn't look or feel nearly as high-end. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The setup is fairly simple, though it requires a few things to get started. First off, you need the Reality Hub app launcher to actually play games in 3D. It's too bad it requires a separate app, but the software at least will scan your game libraries and display any supported games. Beyond that, you'll need to plug in the attached USB-A cable, along with whatever you're using for the display itself. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The menu is fine, though I was annoyed by how many clicks it took to get to brightness or volume controls. It comes with a pair of 5-watt speakers, which are decent but not anything special. You'll buy this monitor for its 3D capabilities, but in reality, you'll use it in standard 2D far more often. While I do hope an OLED is introduced in the future, the Odyssey 3D uses a high-quality 4K IPS panel with a 165-Hz refresh rate to make sure that gaming in 2D is still an enjoyable experience. I measured it at 0.83 with my colorimeter, comparable to OLED panels. In SDR, this is also a brighter panel than most OLEDs, reaching 487 nits of max brightness. It won't be nearly as impressive in HDR, but as it turns out, 3D games aren't supported in HDR anyway. Suffice to say, it's a solid 4K gaming monitor on its own—if only it weren't for the exorbitant price. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. But the point is 3D, and I tried out a number of the compatible games, including Palworld, GTA: San Andreas, Stray, and SpongeBob. Each game I tried utilizes the 3D effect well enough, though you'll run across some cutscenes or in-game situations that don't work well, such as the opening sequence of GTA: San Andreas. You can dial back or pump up the 3D effect with simple keyboard commands. These games run on the Unreal Engine 4 engine, allowing Samsung to approve them without requiring additional developer work. Samsung hasn't announced support for other game engines like Unreal 5 or Unity. That's important because in a game that requires your attention in battles, you don't want the 3D elements to distract. After playing for 30 minutes, you'll find yourself getting used to the extra dimension. The 3D technology isn't explicitly exclusive to games. The monitor can also convert 2D images and videos into 3D, which is fun to experiment with. There are several restrictions, such as the requirement to be in full screen and DRM-protected content. That means you won't be watching full movies in 3D anytime soon. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. But watching clips of films or trailers on YouTube shows just how promising it could be if Samsung can get around the DRM problem. So long as they are full screen and with only one other person, you can even use it on video calls, which I tried out. It's pretty incredible, emulating something akin to a toned-down version of Google's Project Starline. The 3D conversion uses AI to create a depth map to predict where the layers of depth should be. As you may have guessed, it's far from a perfect effect. It also soaks up some performance, causing the Razer Blade 16 I was using to kick its loud fans on. No one should rush out and buy the Samsung Odyssey 3D. It's expensive, and the list of compatible titles is embarrassingly small. With how good gaming monitors are nowadays, you're paying well over $1,000 for the 3D here. Most people should buy an incredible OLED gaming monitor, which costs roughly $800. I can't help but be excited by it. While I'm not sure I'd want to play every game in 3D, there's so much less fatigue, making this a more practical technology over anything wearable. This monitor has made me genuinely excited about the future of 3D displays. While I wait for a future where the entire Windows operating system can be navigated in 3D—both in games and not—the Samsung Odyssey 3D monitor feels like a glimpse into the future. It won't be the last of this technology, as Samsung tells me. (Samsung hosted WIRED at a media event in Seattle and paid for a portion of our reporter's travel expenses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Moderna's mRNA-based flu and covid-19 vaccine could provide the best of both worlds—if it's actually ever approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This week, scientists at Moderna published data from a Phase III trial testing the company's combination vaccine, codenamed mRNA-1083. Individuals given mRNA-1083 appeared to generate the same or even greater immune response compared to those given separate vaccines, the researchers found. But the FDA's recent policy change on vaccine approvals, orchestrated by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, could imperil the development of this and other future vaccines. RFK Jr. Spews Even More Nonsense on Autism, Covid in Latest Interview People were randomly given mRNA-1083 (plus a placebo) or two already approved flu and covid-19 vaccines. The vaccine seemed effective across both age groups, with mRNA-1083 participants showing at least the same level of humoral immune response (antibody-based) to circulating flu and covid-19 strains as participants who were given the separate vaccines. On average, this response was actually higher to the flu strains in particular among those given mRNA-1083. The experimental vaccine also appeared to be safe and well-tolerated, as the authors explained in their paper, published Wednesday in JAMA. The Department of Health and Human Services recently mandated an overhaul of the vaccine approval process, one that will require all new vaccines to undergo placebo-controlled trials to receive approval. Some vaccine experts have said that these changes are unnecessary and potentially unethical, since it could leave some people vulnerable to an infection that already has a vaccine. Goes Full Tinfoil, Pledges to Stop Chemtrails in Latest Dr. Phil Interview RFK Jr. and other recent Trump appointees have also been highly skeptical of mRNA-based vaccines in general, despite no strong evidence that these vaccines are significantly less safe than other types. Moderna stated last week it doesn't expect its mRNA-1083 vaccine to be approved before 2026, following the FDA's request for late-stage data showing the vaccine's effectiveness against flu specifically. But it's worth wondering if even that timeline is now in jeopardy under the current public health regime. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.
