                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world of astronomy is abuzz with excitement. Have we discovered the first-ever evidence of off-world life? ‚ÄúAstronomers have detected the most promising signs yet of a possible biosignature outside the solar system, although they remain cautious,‚Äù states a Cambridge University press release. Across the gulf of space, the James Webb Space Telescope has managed to capture its light spectrum and atmospheric gases like methane, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and dimethyl sulphide also cast shadows when light strikes them. The Cambridge University astronomers have attempted to do just that. Scientists the world over have since been sciencing their results. ‚ÄúWhile this discovery is intriguing, most astronomers ‚Äì including the paper's authors ‚Äì aren't ready to claim that it means extraterrestrial life exists,‚Äù says University of Arizona distinguished professor of astronomy Chris Impey. But any claim of life out there will require a thorough study by the scientific community as a whole before we have confidence in the results,‚Äù adds The Planetary Society's chief scientist, Dr Bruce Betts. In a post-truth world, that confidence is more important than ever. ‚ÄúJust like the boy that cried wolf, no one wants a series of false claims to further diminish society's trust in scientists,‚Äù Johns Hopkins University astrophysicist Kevin Stevenson argues. ‚ÄúContext is important when it comes to science communication, particularly for a hot-button topic like the search for life beyond Earth, and we need to be responsible stewards in that respect.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is in no one's interest to claim prematurely that we have detected life,‚Äù Professor Nikku Madhusudhan, a University of Cambridge astronomer and lead author of the study, told media. But he still called his study a ‚Äúrevolutionary moment‚Äù. It was found in 2015 by the Kepler Space Telescope. It has a radius about 2.4 times larger than that of Earth. Its year is just 32.9 days and it orbits within the habitable ‚ÄúGoldilocks‚Äù Zone (warm enough for liquid water) of a cool red dwarf star about 120 light-years away in the direction of the constellation of Leo. University of Cambridge astronomers believe it may have a thin hydrogen atmosphere over an oceanic surface. But the opposite could also fit the limited known facts: K2-18b could have a thick atmosphere over a magma sea. This molecule is only found on Earth as the by-product of plankton and bacterial life in our oceans. And that makes it a contender for the position of ‚Äúbiomarker‚Äù ‚Äì a chemical ‚Äúsmoking gun‚Äù to the presence of life on other worlds. But has dimethyl sulphide really been found on K2-18b? ‚ÄúEvery detector has some noise from the random motion of electrons,‚Äù Professor Impey explained. ‚ÄúThe signal should be strong enough to have a low probability of arising by chance from this noise.‚Äù Astrobiologists thought they saw indications of water vapor. Upon revision, this later turned out to be methane. But the raw data they drew their conclusions from has since been re-examined by different scientists using different methods. They have not confirmed the presence of CO2 or dimethyl sulphide. ‚ÄúWe didn't know for sure whether the signal we saw last time was due to DMS (dimethyl sulphide), but just the hint of it was exciting enough for us to have another look with JWST using a different instrument,‚Äù Professor Madhusudhan explained. ‚ÄúThis is an independent line of evidence, using a different instrument than we did before and a different wavelength range of light, where there is no overlap with the previous observations. Evidence has begun to emerge that dimethyl sulphide can be produced by non-biological means. Its signature spectrum has been spotted in the clouds of dust and gas that drift between stars. It may have been seen on an uninhabitable comet. Laboratory studies hint that it could be broken out of other molecules under UV light. Professor Madhusudhan concedes there could be previously unknown chemical processes at play. He and his team remain confident in the strength of their findings. ‚ÄúDecades from now, we may look back at this point in time and recognise it was when the living universe came within reach,‚Äù Professor Madhusudhan said. Especially as they indicate K2-18 b's atmosphere is awash with it in concentrations thousands of times greater than Earth's.

But, like all research, this study is just one step in a winding journey, filled with obstacles and dead-ends. ‚ÄúThis study is not a confirmation of life; not even a hypothesis that life is present on K2-18b, but a demonstration of where our methodological strengths and limitations lie, and what must come next to an unambiguous claim of life beyond Earth,‚Äù the SETI statement concludes. In science's famous last words: More research is needed. ‚ÄúIt'll take time to figure all this out,‚Äù adds The Planetary Society. Different teams will do their own investigations, collect more data, learn more about how DMS might be produced, and better understand how it might show up in a planet's atmosphere. Only then will we have a chance at the full story.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At a glance, nothing would appear remarkable about it. Those claims drew such interest, Apple TV is even airing a small series about it titled The Secrets of Mount Hayes. There's also a a short film on YouTube being aired by the Travel Channel, titled: Searching for UFO's Beneath Mount Hayes. A trailer for the series starts with an interview with Jonny Enoch, a self-described Paranormal Researcher, who says: "In my opinion there are unpredictable, dangerous forces at work here." According to LadBible, mystery stems from historic CIA documents that incredibly claimed aliens could be operating hidden bases on Earth, that includes deep under the sea and inside remote mountain ranges (and best taken with a pinch of salt, of course). They were reportedly declassified through the US Freedom of Information Act. And sensationally, the unassuming Mount Hayes was named among them, along with Monte Perdido in Spain and underwater sites off the coast of Puerto Rico and near the Bahamas. One report was titled Description of Personnel Associated ET Bases, points to the peak as the "main base" used by aliens. That's because it has been home to some bizarre UFO sightings, with witnesses reporting unexplained aircraft behaving in strange ways. This was during the 1970s and 80s, a time when the CIA ran experiments with people who claimed they could perceive information about distant objects. It was part of the CIA's STARGATE program, at a time the US was in a Cold War space race with the Soviet Union (which may explain a lot). The report adds that one person interviewed said they could remotely see an "entity" with a "very large, round-shaped head" and a "very unhuman appearance" (yes, really). The sighting was also described as "very pale" with a "sharp nose". Funnily enough, we can't seem to find any records of this person being drug tested, however. The verified History Channel, which has 14.5million subscribers, shared one video titled: CIA Analyst Discovers UFO Base in Alaska. Another video, titled Does Mount Hayes hold the dark secret to thousands of disappearances? So while you'd have thought a hidden alien base in a US mountain was something that would have been discovered by now, the mystery continues to live long in the imagination of internet sleuths.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two studies show major progress in the field of photonic microchips. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. For years, manufacturers have been making them more powerful and efficient, which increases the performance of our electronic devices. This is happening just as there's a need for increased computing power because of the boom in artificial intelligence (AI). An alternative to the electronic microchips we currently use are photonic chips. These use light instead of electricity to achieve higher performance. However, photonic chips have not yet taken off due to a number of hurdles. Now, two papers published in Nature address some of these roadblocks, offering essential stepping stones to achieving the computing power required by complex artificial intelligence systems. By using light (photons) instead of electricity (electrons) for the transport and processing of information, photonic computing promises higher speeds and greater bandwidths with greater efficiency. Related: AI-designed chips are so weird that 'humans cannot really understand them' ‚Äî but they perform better than anything we've created However, converting photons into electrical signals can slow down processing times since light operates at higher speeds. Photonic computing is also based around analogue operations rather than digital ones. It's also difficult to scale them up from small prototypes because large-scale photonic circuits cannot currently be fabricated with sufficient accuracy. The two new papers in Nature address many of these hurdles. Bo Peng, from Singapore-based company Lightelligence, and colleagues demonstrate a new type of processor for photonic computing called a Photonic Arithmetic Computing Engine (Pace). This processor has a low latency, which means that there is a minimal delay between an input or command and the corresponding response or action by the computer. This marks a significant development, despite some speed limitations of the current hardware. ‚ÄîChina achieves quantum supremacy claim with new chip 1 quadrillion times faster than the most powerful supercomputers ‚ÄîLight-powered computer chip can train AI much faster than components powered by electricity In a separate paper, Nicholas Harris, from California-based company Lightmatter, and colleagues describe a photonic processor that was able to run two AI systems with accuracy similar to those of conventional electronic processors. The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of their photonic processor through generating Shakespeare-like text, accurately classifying movie reviews and playing classic Atari computer games such as Pac-Man. This would finally make photonics viable, though further refinements will be needed. These will involve the use of more effective materials or designs.
