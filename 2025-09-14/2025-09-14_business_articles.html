                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saquon Barkley has earned nearly $80 million in NFL salary and bonuses since 2018. Instead of spending that money lavishly, the Philadelphia Eagles running back has invested millions of it in a variety of venture funds and tech startups, according to a report published by The Profile on September 3. Those funds and startups reportedly include artificial intelligence firm Anthropic, Elon Musk-owned neurotech company Neuralink, prediction market Polymarket and venture capital fund Founders Fund, which is run by billionaire investor and political activist Peter Thiel. DON'T MISS: How to build a standout personal brand—online, in person and at work 2 pick in the 2018 NFL draft, he signed a $31.2 million contract — and, wary of overspending and watching his sudden fortune quickly vanish, vowed to invest while living off his endorsement deals instead. Kind of want to follow the Marshawn Lynch method. And just live off the endorsement deals,'" Barkley told ESPN in June 2018. Barkley has endorsement deals with brands including Nike, Pepsi and Toyota. The NFL star initially parked much of his rookie contract in traditional long-term investments like S&P 500 index funds, The Profile reported. More recently, he's embraced some risk — investing in mobile payments app Strike in 2021, and announcing plans to convert all his marketing and endorsement earnings to bitcoin using the app, for example. Since then, the price of bitcoin has more than tripled, "turning a $10 million income stream into a $35 million asset," The Profile noted. More broadly, startup investing can be a risky approach to money management: Young companies, even trendy ones with lofty valuations, are never guaranteed to succeed. Barkley has funded more than 10 startups, usually at between $250,000 and $500,000 per startup, The Profile reported — likely only constituting a fraction of his career earnings, so far. Barkley interrogates a company's founder or founders directly before choosing to invest, he told the publication. "They have to be confident, but arrogance is a turn-off." He received some extra motivation to grow his wealth as much as possible during his playing career from a severe injury in 2020, when a torn ACL cause him to miss most of his third NFL season, he told the "The Best Business Show" podcast in an episode that aired in July 2021. The injury forced Barkley to reflect, he said: Running backs endure a lot of physical contact, and tend to have shorter careers than many other professional athletes. If he wasn't going to play for as long as some other superstar athletes — people like LeBron James or Tom Brady — he needed to embrace financial strategies outside of football "to create generational wealth" with his paychecks, he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anyone who has ever gone in search of a product review on Amazon knows how valuable the experience of other shoppers can be, and how easy it is to fall down the rabbit hole of customer comments, from five-star raves to one-star takedowns — sometimes hundreds of words to get to the point. As Amazon continues to roll out AI features it says will make shopping easier, AI-generated audio descriptions of products are in the mix and scraping that customer commentary — maybe ultimately settling into a position to replace it as a go-to source of buying information. The summaries began rolling out during the summer on select products to a subset of U.S. customers and have now reached all U.S. customers as a button in the mobile shopping app, scaling up to cover over one million products. A unique appeal of Amazon, and other e-commerce options, has always been the ability to get information from actual users, not just product descriptions. You still have to sort through various efforts to game the system, and in recent years, signs that the newest review writers are chatbots like ChatGPT. But actual people sharing their actual, idiosyncratic experience with a product — customers as a source of information, and informed decision making — have been a key part of the learning process from clothing and shoe sizes to safety and more narrow questions: When purchasing a new toaster, does it do bagels, is the timer setting accurate, how easy is it to clean the crumb tray? Reviews are by nature unwieldy in the mass individuality, but human readers have proven pretty adept at distilling what they need from the human chaos. In some sense, the brain of the average Amazon review reader is a pretty good large language model, skimming and picking out key words and key information, so an AI will have to do it at least as well as a human would if it's to add to the customer experience as promised. For one, it won't experience cognitive overload when facing an electric tea kettle on Amazon with over 32,000 reviews. That can still be tricky for AI to get right, and it may be inherently problematic to mix product catalogs, customer reviews, and web information into a single distillation – with the sources of this information each coming with its own set of intentions. "It's important to recognize where AI is currently strong, such as in automation and pattern recognition, and where it still falls short, like in judgment-heavy tasks," said Ankur Edkie, CEO & co-founder, Murf AI, which creates AI voiceovers. If that isn't achieved, the sense of gimmickry is likely to sneak in through a door left open for AI fatigue, which he says consumers are likely experiencing by now. For example, even a few negative reviews on safety can outweigh many positives on other features," Edkie said, adding that if a customer is focused solely on product performance, then summaries that emphasize price might not be relevant. The ability to factor in context, and to make the review process more of a dialogue between consumer and machine is likely where the technology is headed – in other words, toward the agentic side of AI, where Amazon is also actively adding to its AI commerce tools, such as Rufus, and a shopping tool called Interests AI, which prompts users to describe an interest "using your own words," and then it generates a curated selection of products. Chat and audio summaries will remain among the ways to engage, but having real-time conversations with an AI voice agent — asking specific questions, clarifying concerns, and getting deeper insights from reviews — is what will shift the experience from one-way delivery to two-way discovery, making it far more personalized, according to Edkie. "Currently, you can interact with Rufus through text or by using voice input, but Rufus cannot talk back, its responses are text-only," he said. Brian Numainville, principal at consumer research firm Feedback Group, says by providing an audio-based alternative to visually presented information, these types of features have the potential to make shopping more accessible, converting detailed text into easily consumed audio summaries. However, for it to truly benefit people with visual impairments, the feature must be thoughtfully designed. "The shift from diverse human reviews to AI-generated summaries might mean losing important nuances, context, and personal touches," Numainville said. The tendency of AI to focus on common themes can dilute responses even as it distills them. Human reviews tend to include digressive stories and details around highly specific use cases — think of what motivates someone to write a review in the first place, and how this pairs well with the shopper's anxieties and decision-making process — all of which can help to make the shopping experience more personal and insightful. "AI might overlook unique insights or niche needs that don't align with the majority of responses," Numainville said. "Additionally, the ability to critically interpret reviews — like spotting biases or trusting certain reviewers — is diminished with AI summaries." Scraping a great deal of content to generate the summaries also sacrifices the annotation that can distinguish among product descriptions, customer reviews, and web information. "It's not 100% clear how much of the product description versus reviews is used in the current implementation — Amazon hasn't fully detailed this mix," said Numainville. Mixed without attribution — which by definition flattens information sources — it could be difficult for customers to discern ad-speak from genuine reviews, with the results be something like native advertising. "This blending, if it occurred, could unintentionally mislead consumers by lending factual authority to subjective opinions or disguising promotional material as unbiased reviews," Numainville said. Research does show that customers are inclined to trust voice as a format of information delivery, regardless of how balanced the information being delivered is. "It seems likely to me Amazon's desire to sell products would weigh more highly than incorporating all critical perspectives on a product," said Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University in Australia. Another concern is that "AI might weigh average and overall scores, while buyers often look at the few negative reviews – the one stars – even if there isn't a lot of them," Leaver said. Dr. Nauman Dawalatabad, a research scientist at Zoom Communications, said in his personal view the technology is moving in the direction of better customer experience. "I take it as technology helping us to make informed decisions," he said, citing the cognitive fatigue and wasted time that can come from reading through customer reviews. If a streamlined description ends up leading to impulse purchases and regrets, that is on the buyer, he says, and no different than the way things have always operated — the same charges of subtle coercion could be made against all marketing efforts. He thinks that as voice-based agentic AI continues to evolve and consumers start talking (instead of typing and searching) with an AI agent and describe what they want, "it will get you exactly what you need."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investors seeking exposure to companies that are well-positioned to capture AI-led growth can track the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts, who can help pick the stocks that can deliver attractive returns over the long term. Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on past performance. Semiconductor company Broadcom (AVGO) reported impressive fiscal third-quarter results and issued solid guidance, thanks to AI tailwinds. AVGO stock rallied following the results, as the company stated that it has secured a new $10 billion customer. Citing strong fundamentals, JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur reaffirmed a buy rating on Broadcom stock and boosted the price target to $400 from $325, saying that AVGO remains a top pick in semiconductors. Likewise, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an "outperform" rating on AVGO stock with a price target of $396. Sur attributed Broadcom's strong results and solid revenue outlook for the October quarter to accelerating AI demand, stabilizing non-AI semiconductors, and impressive momentum in the VMware business. Sur believes that the new customer from whom Broadcom secured orders worth $10 billion is OpenAI, considering the AI inference use case and his prior research. The analyst now expects AI revenue to increase by 125% to $45 billion in fiscal 2026, followed by a 60% increase in fiscal 2027. Sur said the strength in AVGO's AI revenue supports his view that the company's internally developed custom AI chips offer meaningful differentiation, efficiency and improved economics. "Despite macro volatility, Broadcom's diversified portfolio and product cycles support a solid revenue growth profile," concluded Sur. 39 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Next on this week's list is Zscaler (ZS), a cybersecurity company that recently delivered strong results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by demand for its Zero Trust and AI security solutions. Impressed by the Q4 FY25 print, Stifel analyst Adam Borg reiterated a buy rating on Zscaler stock and raised the price forecast to $330 from $295. Borg stated that Zscaler delivered solid results, consistent with Stifel's positive checks. He added that the company's Q4 FY25 performance was strong across key metrics, driven by strong execution and demand for the company's broadening Zero-Trust portfolio. Borg was particularly pleased with robust growth in billings and remaining performance obligations. Notably, RPO growth (31%) accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter. Borg is also upbeat about the company's newer solutions like Z-Flex. He continues to believe that "Zscaler's leading-portfolio helps improve an organization's security posture, drives vendor consolidation, and reduces costs." Bord expects Zscaler to sustain at least high-teens top-line growth and margin expansion in the coming years, driven by multiple drivers. Database software maker and cloud infrastructure company Oracle (ORCL) saw its stock spike this week, as the company's robust cloud growth projections overshadowed its Q1 earnings miss. The company surprised the market by reporting a 359% year-over-year growth in its remaining performance obligations, a measure of contracted revenue, to $455 billion. Oracle's robust outlook made Jefferies analyst Brent Thill increase his price target to $360 from $270 while reiterating a buy rating on the stock. TipRanks' AI Analyst also has an "outperform" rating on ORCL stock with a price target of $264. "RPO stole the show in F1Q," stated Thill. The 5-star analyst added that Oracle's Q1 RPO crushed estimates and reinforced his confidence in the company's narrative about acceleration in its growth. Thill highlighted that Oracle added $317 billion sequentially in RPO, nearly five times the fiscal 2026 total revenue estimate of $67 billion, which supports growing AI optimism. He noted that this massive growth can be mainly attributed to four multi-billion-dollar contracts across three customers, with more such deals expected to close soon and drive RPO beyond $500 billion. The analyst also pointed out that the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) business is expected to grow by 77% to $18 billion in fiscal 2026 and then jump to $144 billion by fiscal 2030. Thill added that this impressive growth forecast indicates the rising demand for AI inference and training workloads, which management sees as a massive total addressable market that the company can capture. Additionally, Thill mentioned the impressive surge in Oracle's multicloud database revenue, though off smaller numbers, suggesting rapid adoption of the company's multicloud strategy. In fact, Oracle now expects notable growth in multicloud revenue every quarter for the next several years while expanding to 71 (net addition of 37) data centers across hyperscaler peers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Romania scrambled fighter jets on Saturday when a drone breached the country's airspace during a Russian attack on Ukrainian infrastructure near the border, the defense ministry said. Defense Minister Ionut Mosteanu said the F-16 pilots came close to taking down the drone as it was flying very low before it left national airspace toward Ukraine. A threat of drone strikes also prompted Poland to deploy aircraft and close an airport in the eastern city of Lublin on Saturday, three days after it shot down Russian drones in its airspace with the backing of aircraft from its NATO allies. Romania, a European Union and NATO state which shares a 650-km (400-mile) border with Ukraine, has had Russian drone fragments fall onto its territory repeatedly since Russia began waging war on its neighbor. On Saturday, it scrambled two F-16 fighter jets and later two Eurofighters - part of German air policing missions in Romania - and warned citizens in the southeastern county of Tulcea near the Danube and its Ukrainian border to take cover, the defense ministry said in a statement. It added the jets detected a drone in national airspace, which they followed until it dropped off the radar 20 km southwest of the village of Chilia Veche. Mosteanu told private television station Antena 3 that helicopters will survey the area near the border to look for potential drone parts, "but all information at this moment indicates the drone exited airspace to Ukraine." Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on social media platform X that data showed the drone breached about 10 kilometers into Romanian territory and operated in NATO airspace for around 50 minutes. "It is an obvious expansion of the war by Russia – and this is exactly how they act," he said. NATO announced plans to beef up the defense of Europe's eastern flank on Friday, after Poland shot down drones that had violated its airspace, the first known shots fired by a member of the Western alliance during Russia's war in Ukraine. Romanian lawmakers approved a law earlier this year enabling the army to shoot down drones illegally breaching Romanian airspace during peacetime, based on threat levels and risks to human life and property, but the bill does not yet have all enforcement rules approved. Swedish Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard wrote on platform X that the airspace breach was "another unacceptable violation of NATO airspace." "Sweden stands in full solidarity with Romania as a NATO Ally and EU Member State. We are always ready to contribute further to the deterrence and defence of the Alliance."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That dream might be creeping out of reach for younger people trying to break into the industry, which looks to be on the cusp of a big shift as firms trim their ranks, double down on AI, and tighten performance standards across the career ladder, industry analysts told Business Insider. No one is exactly sure how it will play out, as much of the future will depend on where the economy goes and how quickly AI is adopted. That restructuring is already faintly visible in the numbers. According to Revelio Labs, a workforce intelligence firm, job postings in the consulting sector — which encompasses both consultants and adjacent job titles in the industry — have declined each year since peaking in 2022. Among consultants in particular, the monthly inflow of senior-level workers, which Revelio classifies as the "manager" level, dropped 22% year-over-year in June. The inflow of entry-level consultants in June was down 54% year-over-year. The decline, while stark, isn't necessarily apocalyptic. Management Consulted, a firm that conducts industry research and offers career guidance for consultants, says the drop is largely confined to specific areas of the market, like strategy consulting. But it's what most people think of when they envision a consultant, as it involves advising businesses on key decisions like hiring and firing, spending, and expansion plans, Namaan Mian, the chief operating officer at the firm, told BI. McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group — known as "The Big Three" in the management and strategy consulting space — have seen their head count numbers slow or decline in recent years. Bain reported it lost around 1,000 employees globally from 2022 through 2024. McKinsey, which didn't release head count figures in its 2024 report, was reported to have around 40,000 employees this year, down 11% from levels in 2022. Some of the firms have said they're all-in again on entry-level hiring. BCG also directed BI to a statement about its growth in 2024. Ron Kermisch, a senior partner and the global head of talent acquisition at Bain, told Business Insider the firm grew its summer MBA program in North America by 20% this year. "I think that's PR positioning," Mian said of companies talking about ramping up hiring. "Because you still want to be seen as an aspirational brand for top talent. And if you start to talk about how entry-level hiring is going to decrease in the future, then some of this top up-and-coming talent isn't going to consider you as a potential employer." "I think we're going to continue to see a very gradual culling of the herd in certain practice areas at certain levels," he added, speculating that the shift could stretch on for as long as a decade before stabilizing. Tom Rodenhauser, a consulting analyst and the managing partner at Kennedy Intelligence, also believes the decline in strategy consulting is more secular than cyclical. Mian thinks the industry is shifting away from the pyramid model — one with a fat base and a skinny top-tier — to one with a larger middle that is lean on the entry- and senior-level workers. That reflects the fact that consulting firms are now looking for more experience, or those who have knowledge in a specific field, Mian said. "These firms are emphasizing experience and expertise more than they ever have before," he added. "And so, you still might be hiring nine or 10 people in a given office in a given year, but now instead of all 10 of them being undergrad analysts, maybe only half of them are." Like many employers, consultancies have been cutting costs and leaning toward artificial intelligence. Mian says that could play a big role in entry-level hiring going forward. A Revelio analysis found that consulting was one of the industries most exposed to AI, with 45% of activities that could be performed using artificial intelligence. "So could that cut down on analyst hiring in the future? Absolutely," Mian said, adding that he believed junior talent was most at risk. Some firms are promoting fewer partners than they were in the past. Kermisch said Bain had "refined" its recruiting process and was now searching for specific traits among its pool of potential hires. The company is seeking those who have EQ—which will allow consultants to work effectively with clients—and what he calls "technical curiosity." "We want people to constantly be thinking, 'How can I apply AI here?'" "We want people whose natural disposition is to think that way first, so they can get that work done more quickly, more creatively than they would before." Kermisch said he wasn't sure if it was now more difficult for consultants across the industry to become partners. He believes that large employers in the space will stick to the pyramid model, but he said it was possible that niche consultancies could have smaller entry and senior-level ranks in the future. "They're making it harder for you to be ranked as a top performer, and so that affects the opportunities you get," Mian said of the partner track. Rodenhauser thinks a similar change will unfold over the coming years. "The old world — of even five years ago — and what particularly students were joining when they joined one of these firms is not going to be what it was," he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. and Chinese officials began talks in Madrid on Sunday on their strained trade ties, a looming divestiture deadline for Chinese short video app TikTok and Washington's demands that its allies place tariffs on China over its purchases of Russian oil. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer arrived shortly before Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and China's top trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, at the Baroque Palacio de Santa Cruz which houses Spain's foreign ministry in the Spanish capital. The delegations last met in Stockholm in July where they agreed in principle to extend for 90 days a trade truce that sharply reduced triple-digit retaliatory tariffs on both sides and restarted the flow of rare-earth minerals from China to the United States. Trump has approved the extension of current U.S. tariff rates on Chinese goods, totaling about 55%, until Nov. 10. Trade experts said there was little likelihood of a substantial breakthrough in the talks hosted by Spain, which has sought to improve ties with Beijing in recent years. The most likely result of the Madrid talks is seen as another extension of a deadline for the popular TikTok app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations by Sept. 17 or face a U.S. shutdown. A source familiar with the Trump administration's discussions on TikTok's future said that a deal was not expected, but that the deadline would be extended for a fourth time since Trump took office in January. Wendy Cutler, a former USTR trade negotiator and head of the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington, said she expected more substantial "deliverables" to be saved for a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later this year, perhaps at an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Seoul at the end of October. These may include a final deal to resolve U.S. national security concerns over TikTok, and a lifting of restrictions on Chinese purchases of American soybeans and reduction of fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese goods, and the Madrid discussions may help lay groundwork for such a meeting, Cutler said. But she said resolving core U.S. economic complaints about China, including its demands that China shift its economic model toward more domestic consumption and rely less on state-subsidized exports, could take years. "Frankly, I don't think China is in any rush to do an agreement where they don't get substantial concessions on export controls and lower tariffs, which are their key priorities," Cutler said. "And I don't see the United States in a position to make major concessions on either, unless there's some breakthrough on its demands to China." The Treasury has said the Madrid talks also would cover joint U.S.-Chinese efforts to combat money laundering, a reference to its longstanding demands that China clamp down on illicit shipments of technology goods to Russia that aid its war in Ukraine. Bessent urged Group of Seven allies on Friday to impose "meaningful tariffs" on imports from China and India to pressure them to stop buying Russian oil, a move aimed at bringing Moscow into Ukraine peace negotiations by curbing its oil revenues. Bessent and Greer said in a separate statement that G7 allies should join the United States in imposing tariffs on buyers of Russian oil. "Only with a unified effort that cuts off the revenues funding Putin's war machine at the source will we be able to apply sufficient economic pressure to end the senseless killing," Bessent and Greer said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The U.S. has imposed an extra 25% tariff on Indian goods over the country's purchases of Russian oil, but has so far refrained from imposing such punitive duties on Chinese goods. China's Ministry of Commerce has said the Madrid talks will cover economic and trade issues such as U.S. tariffs, the "abuse" of export controls and TikTok. A Spanish government source said the choice of Spain for the latest round of the "delicate" talks was evidence that Madrid was consolidating itself as a seat of high-level and strategic negotiations. Spain has criticised Israel's offensive in Gaza and refused to commit to spending 5% of its budget on defense along with other NATO members. Bessent himself has also criticized Spain for declaring Beijing a "strategic partner" at the height of Trump's tariff offensive in April, saying that a closer relationship with the Asian giant was akin to "cutting your own throat."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A state visit always sends a buzz through the newsroom — and U.S. President Donald Trump's trip to the U.K. next week looks set to deliver royal, political and business headlines, despite being his second such visit. Wednesday will bring the royal pomp and ceremony. Trump and First Lady Melania will be greeted at Windsor Castle by King Charles and Queen Camilla with a royal salute, followed by a carriage procession. Later, the president will lay a wreath on the tomb of Queen Elizabeth II, which will be followed by a flypast of American F-35 military jets alongside the British Red Arrows. The day will end with a state banquet, during which both the king and president will make speeches. Trump will head to Chequers, the country house of sitting U.K. prime ministers, where he'll meet Keir Starmer for a series of bilateral meetings, followed by a joint press conference later that day. From a foreign policy perspective, the timing is awkward. Starmer has just fired the U.K.'s U.S. ambassador Peter Mandelson, citing fresh details over his connections with disgraced pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Interestingly, just two weeks ago, the Telegraph reported that Trump had invited Mandelson's predecessor, Karen Pierce, to this week's state banquet, in a sign that trouble may already have been brewing. Both Trump and Starmer may be depending on the tech bros to bring some positive headlines. CNBC's Ryan Browne reported Friday that Nvidia and OpenAI — which are both part of the U.S. business delegation traveling with Trump — are set to make major U.K. investment commitments. The two tech firms are discussing a sizable deal to support data center development in the country, which could ultimately be worth billions of dollars, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will also attend the state banquet at Windsor Castle, as well as the meetings with Starmer. Bessent will be fresh off the plane from Madrid, Spain, where he is meeting with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng for the fourth round of trade talks between the U.S. and China. They are also expected to address the future of TikTok, which faces another deadline on Sept. 17, to decide on either an American ban on the social media app, or a partial sale by its Chinese parent ByteDance. And while state visits are known for their meticulous planning, the newsroom will be keeping its eyes and ears open for any unexpected moments — whether it's a hot-mic slip-up, controversial outfit choice, exotic banquet menu selection, or any other surprises that could come our way.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the days since Charlie Kirk's death, some companies have been forced to navigate a delicate situation: employees sharing their personal views about the conservative activist in public. For employers, those remarks highlight the growing challenge of balancing free expression with corporate values and workplace harmony. Major corporations like Microsoft and Delta Air Lines are taking action against employees who have made social media posts critical of Kirk's own views, or even ones celebrating his death, which could be considered a violation of company values. Kirk, an ally of President Donald Trump, advocated conservative beliefs on college campuses and was influential among young people on the right. Microsoft shared an X post on Friday addressing negative remarks about Kirk made online by some of its employees. Microsoft said, "Comments celebrating violence against anyone are unacceptable and do not align with our values." Microsoft's statement came after Tesla CEO Elon Musk called out Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on X in response to an unverified claim that some employees at Blizzard, a video game company owned by Microsoft, had posted comments "trashing" Kirk. The ODP Corporation, parent company of Office Depot, apologized to consumers on Friday after footage taken at a Michigan Office Depot gained attention on social media. "The behavior displayed by our associate is completely unacceptable and insensitive, violates our company policies, and does not reflect the values we uphold at Office Depot. "We continue to aggressively investigate the matter and will take action where appropriate." On Friday, Nasdaq said it fired an employee for their remarks about Kirk because they violated company policy. Nasdaq has a zero-tolerance policy toward violence and any commentary that condones or celebrates violence," the company said on X. "The employee in question has been terminated, effective immediately." Political analyst Matthew Dowd was widely attacked online after making remarks about Kirk during an appearance on MSNBC's "Katy Tur Reports" on Wednesday. MSNBC president Rebecca Kutler called Dowd's comments "insensitive" in an X post later that day. "During our breaking news coverage of the shooting of Charlie Kirk, Matthew Dowd made comments that were inappropriate, insensitive, and unacceptable," the statement said. "We apologize for his statements, as has he. There is no place for violence in America, political or otherwise." Dowd responded in a subsequent Substack article on Friday, confirming that MSNBC had fired him. "The Right Wing media mob ginned up, went after me on a plethora of platforms, and MSNBC reacted to that mob," he wrote. "Even though most at MSNBC knew my words were being misconstrued, the timing of my words forgotten (remember I said this before anyone knew Kirk was a target), and that I apologized for any miscommunication on my part, I was terminated by the end of the day." Comcast and Versant executives urged employees to "treat people with kindness" in a memo on Friday. Versant is an independent media company being spun off from Comcast and NBCUniversal that will eventually own MSNBC. "Regardless of whether you agreed with his political views, his words and actions underscore the urgency to maintain a respectful exchange of ideas — a principle we must champion," the memo said. The memo added: "As employees, we ask you to embody our values in your work and communities. The firm fired a lawyer whose social media posts about Kirk gained attention online, where commentators noted his place of work, according to The Wall Street Journal. On Thursday, the Carolina Panthers addressed comments from one of its employees, writing on X, "The views expressed by our employees are their own and do not represent those of the Carolina Panthers." "We do not condone violence of any kind. Delta Air Lines suspended an unknown number of employees over their social media posts about Kirk, a companywide memo viewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution showed. He added: "Violations of our social media policy can carry meaningful consequences, including termination." Business Insider contacted all the companies mentioned in this story for comment.</p>
