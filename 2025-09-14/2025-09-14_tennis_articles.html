That set the stage for former World No. Earlier in the day, Martinez and Jaume Munar had reenergised Spanish hopes with a vital 1-6, 6-3, 6-2 doubles win against August Holmgren and Johannes Ingildsen. With his singles victory against Rune, Martinez improved to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Rune. "The feeling [at Davis Cup] is totally different,‚Äù said Martinez after his win. ‚ÄúMaybe I get more nervous but, this adrenaline, it doesn't work on some players. "Hopefully I can continue playing like this in Davis Cup. For me it's one of the most important things in my career." Collingnon The Hero Again For Belgium Raphael Collignon capped a dream weekend at the Davis Cup qualifiers for both himself and Belgium with a decisive comeback victory against Aleksandar Vukic on Sunday in Sydney. Having battled cramps on Saturday during a three-set upset of World No. 8 Alex de Minaur, Collignon outlasted Vukic 6-7(5), 6-2, 6-3 to earn Belgium a stunning 3-2 win at Ken Rosewall Arena. 91 in the PIF ATP Rankings broke Vukic's serve twice in each of the second and third sets to complete a memorable triumph for the European nation. Collignon completes the comeback against Vukic 6-7(5) 6-2 6-3, sealing Belgium's place in Bologna's final 8! Despite heading into Sunday's action trailing 0-2, Australia threatened to pull off a memorable comeback after drawing level at 2-2. Rinky Hijikata and Jordan Thompson prevailed 6-7(7), 6-3, 6-4 in the doubles rubber against Sander Gille and Joran Vliegen, before De Minaur downed Zizou Bergs 6-2, 7-5.
