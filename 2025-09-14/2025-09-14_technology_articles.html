I think both are absolutely true at the same time, and there's a lot of historical precedent for both of those things being true at the same time.” Register now and save up to $668.Regular Bird rates end September 26 Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch's coverage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SpaceX's has been partnering with mobile carriers like T-Mobile to offer its satellite internet service Starlink to extend the reach of cell networks. Following a major purchase of wireless spectrum earlier this week, it appears everyone is expecting Elon Musk's company to get into the wireless network business for itself. On Monday, it was reported that SpaceX was finalizing a deal with satellite communications company EchoStar, the parent company of Dish Network, to buy up $17 billion worth of wireless spectrum. All signs suggest that SpaceX is after that spectrum to help build out Starlink's 5G network, with the rumored goal to move satellite connectivity for phones beyond just emergency services and access in remote locations to a full-blown mobile network. Musk hasn't exactly backed away from the rumors. In an appearance on the All-In Podcast, he claimed the newly acquired spectrum would allow the company to deliver “high-bandwidth connectivity” directly from satellites to connected devices, albeit with a two-year lead time to get everything set up. “The net effect is you should be able to watch videos anywhere on your phone,” he said. That's a big jump from Starlink's current network offerings, which is currently only used for sending and receiving texts. Take it with a grain of salt, given Musk's longstanding history of overpromising, but it does at least give some clarity as to his company's end goal. As for starting up a network to compete with AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon, Musk didn't rule it out when talking to the All-In guys, who are always more than happy to drink the Kool-Aid unprompted. So getting into those spaces may require an acquisition rather than building its own network. If Musk and SpaceX were to go that route, it's unlikely they would face regulatory hurdles under the current administration. As WaPo pointed out, Brendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission appointed by Donald Trump, called SpaceX's spectrum purchase a “potential game changer” for mobile networks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For European colonial powers, it was Christianity and the promise of saving souls while extracting resources. For today's AI empire, it's artificial general intelligence to “benefit all humanity.” And OpenAI is its chief evangelist, spreading zeal across the industry in a way that has reframed how AI is built. “The only way to really understand the scope and scale of OpenAI's behavior…is actually to recognize that they've already grown more powerful than pretty much any nation state in the world, and they've consolidated an extraordinary amount of not just economic power, but also political power,” Hao said. And so you can only describe it as an empire.” OpenAI has described AGI as “a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work,” one that will somehow “elevate humanity by increasing abundance, turbocharging the economy, and aiding in the discovery of new scientific knowledge that changes the limits of possibility.” These nebulous promises have fueled the industry's exponential growth — its massive resource demands, oceans of scraped data, strained energy grids, and willingness to release untested systems into the world. All in service of a future that many experts say may never arrive. “You can also develop new techniques in algorithms,” she said. Last week, OpenAI said it expects to burn through $115 billion in cash by 2029. Meta said in July that it would spend up to $72 billion on building AI infrastructure this year. Google expects to hit up to $85 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, most of which will be spent on expanding AI and cloud infrastructure. In her book, Hao also documents workers in developing countries like Kenya and Venezuela who were exposed to disturbing content, including child sexual abuse material, and were paid very low wages — around $1 to $2 an hour — in roles like content moderation and data labeling. She pointed to Google DeepMind's Nobel Prize-winning AlphaFold, which is trained on amino acid sequence data and complex protein folding structures, and can now accurately predict the 3D structure of proteins from their amino acids — profoundly useful for drug discovery and understanding disease. “Those are the types of AI systems that we need,” Hao said. “AlphaFold does not create mental health crises in people. AlphaFold does not lead to colossal environmental harms … because it's trained on substantially less infrastructure. Of course, many will argue that OpenAI and other AI companies have benefitted humanity by releasing ChatGPT and other large language models, which promise huge gains in productivity by automating tasks like coding, writing, research, customer support, and other knowledge-work tasks. Two former OpenAI safety researchers told TechCrunch that they fear the AI lab has begun to confuse its for-profit and non-profit missions — that because people enjoy using ChatGPT and other products built on LLMs, this ticks the box of benefiting humanity. “Even as the evidence accumulates that what they're building is actually harming significant amounts of people, the mission continues to paper all of that over,” Hao said. “There's something really dangerous and dark about that, of [being] so wrapped up in a belief system you constructed that you lose touch with reality.” Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple hosted its new hardware event today, releasing its iPhone 17 lineup, along with updates for the Apple Watch and AirPods. For the iPhone 17 models, updates included larger screens and an improved camera system, as well as the introduction of an ultra-thin iPhone Air that replaces the Plus model. And the company may be announcing more new hardware soon, with Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reporting that a new iPad Pro, an updated Vision Pro, updated AirTags, a new Apple TV, a new HomePod mini, and updated MacBooks are coming in either 2025 or the first half of 2026. It features a slightly larger 6.3-inch screen, which is an increase of 0.2 inches compared to the iPhone 16. The phone also has a 48-megapixel ultrawide camera. It comes in new colors: lavender, mist blue, black, white, and sage. The iPhone 17 starts at $799 and has a base storage of 256GB. In contrast, the iPhone 16 started at $699 for 128GB. Called “TechWoven” cases, these feature a higher quality woven material compared to the discontinued “FineWoven” line of fabric cases Apple released in 2023. Missing from the keynote was any mention of an AI-enhanced Siri, which puts Apple way behind Google and its competitors. This device has a profile thickness of 5.6 mm, making it about 0.08 inches thinner than current iPhones. This move appears to be Apple's response to the trend of slimmer smartphones, following in the footsteps of other companies like Samsung and Huawei. Additionally, it may pave the way for Apple's long-rumored foldable phone, predicted to launch in September 2026. After a two-year wait, Apple announced the Apple Watch Ultra 3, which includes faster charging speeds, 5G support, and satellite connectivity. The third-generation Apple Watch SE, meanwhile, didn't receive major updates, aside from an always-on display, thanks to a faster S10 chip. The AirPods Pro 3, priced at $249, features smaller earbuds, improved audio, and a new heart-rate-sensing feature. It also features live translation technology, powered by Apple Intelligence, to help users translate foreign languages in real time. Lauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's comeback week, and not just because I have returned from vacation. I'm talking about the biennial IAA Mobility conference in Munich and the purposeful effort among German automakers to show the world it can still offer compelling, technologically advanced, and affordable vehicles. VW Group, Mercedes, and BMW all showcased numerous new vehicles, including electric ones. And executives made their battle cries: VW Group Oliver Blume struck a bullish tone in a few interviews with reporters and laid out the company's plan to be competitive in China, particularly with EVs, a category where VW has lagged. The German automakers are hoping their latest products — including a new all-electric Mercedes GLC, the BMW iX3 with its four “superbrain” computers, and the Volkswagen ID Polo and ID Cross concept — will preserve and even grow market share. Chinese companies like BYD almost doubled their market share in Europe over the past year, JATO Dynamics reported in July. One other IAA news item of note: Rimac Technology, the tech and parts unit of Rimac Group, has developed solid-state battery packs it says will be available by late 2027. Hyundai and Aptiv had created a joint venture (called Motional) with an agreement to invest $4 billion in the effort. Aptiv backed out in early 2024, leaving Hyundai to either invest its own money, find other outside partners, or shutter the program altogether. Hyundai opted to invest $1 billion — $475 million directly into Motional as part of a broader deal that includes buying out joint venture partner Aptiv. Now it appears Hyundai is investing more into Motional in two tranches. The second comes next year, and I'm still trying to nail down that amount. That first figure is in line with reporting from a Korean outlet. That's pretty typical for large corporations to stay mum. However, one little bird who is deep within the AV industry also noted that Hyundai might not want to make a big deal about this, considering it's also working with Waymo. In other little bird chirpings, there are two new hires at General Motors that you might find interesting. Sony Mohapatra, the former senior manager of AI compute platforms at Cruise, has landed as director of AI and machine learning engineering at General Motors. And Paul Menson, who was the senior staff account manager of Megapack at Tesla, is now director of energy storage systems business development at General Motors. Via, the transit software startup that garnered attention for its consumer-facing on-demand shuttle service, has made its IPO debut. But this time, Via took the big IPO leap. The company, which is known for its Citymapper mobile navigation app, said it sold 10.7 million shares for $46 per share. In all, Via raised $492.9 million at a $3.7 billion valuation. That's just slightly above its $3.5 billion valuation that it garnered back in 2023 during its last venture raise. We had to wrap up this newsletter before it officially began trading, but I'll be back next week with an update. Arc Boats, the Los Angeles startup founded in 2021 by former SpaceX employees, signed a $160 million contract with Curtin Maritime for new hybrid-electric tugs, which are expected to hit the waters around the Los Angeles port in 2027. Standard Fleet, a fleet management software company, raised $13 million in a Series A round led by Nova Threshold with participation from WEX Venture Capital, SNR, Garry Tan (CEO of Y Combinator), Salil Deshpande (Uncorrelated Ventures), and Apoorv Bhargava (WeaveGrid). The Federal Aviation Administration announced a new pilot program that will let electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) startups test some operations before they receive full regulatory certification. Hyundai's once-buzzy electric air taxi startup Supernal is having trouble getting off the ground. The company paused work on its aircraft program after a rocky few months that saw staff cuts and the departure of its CEO and CTO, two people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. InDrive, the Mountain View-based startup that got its start in Siberia and is known for its bidding-based ride-hailing model across Asia and Latin America, wants to be a global super app. Lyft and May Mobility have launched a robotaxi service in Atlanta, the first commercial deployment in the two companies' partnership. Nevada's Occupational Safety and Health Administration opened an investigation after a Boring Company employee sustained a “crushing injury” working on one of its tunnels in Las Vegas. Tesla has the proper permit to begin testing autonomous vehicle technology on public roads in Nevada. And it will need separate approval to operate a commercial ride-hailing service. The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Uber, accusing the ride-hailing company of violating federal law by discriminating against people with physical disabilities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first thing that comes to mind is probably, “I'm saving some money.” For those not fluent in Samsung lingo, FE, which is actually short for “Fan Edition,” is the equivalent of SE in Apple-speak, meaning it's a more budget-friendly alternative to the flagship-level gadgets. I want a lot of the good stuff, too, and I don't want to pay for it, which is why when I got my hands on Samsung's recently released Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 FE, my expectations were elevated. And at $150, they might be even more elevated than usual. It's not that $150 is too much money in the world of wireless earbuds, it's that there are a ton of competitors in that range, and a lot of them punch above their weight class—the OnePlus Buds 4, Nothing's Ear, and Google's Pixel Buds 2a, for example. So, the next logical question is how do the Galaxy Buds 3 FE hold up against competition, and if we already know there are compromises built in, what exactly are they? On that front, I've got good news and bad. Samsung's newest Galaxy Buds 3 FE wireless earbuds sound good but lag in some key departments. For wireless earbuds in this price range, they sound (at the risk of hyperbole) shockingly good. They don't have as much bass as some competitors like OnePlus and its recent pair, the OnePlus Buds 4, but I personally don't mind that at all—I don't key in on bass when it comes to wireless earbuds. I'm more likely to appreciate buds that mitigate distortion, and I would describe the Galaxy Buds 3 FE as pleasantly unmuddled. I could hear vocals upfront, background vocals felt artfully tucked away, arpeggiated synths occupied their own rightful space in the mid and high range, and I didn't detect much distortion even with the volume turned almost all the way up. But what about the stuff you may not like? As much as I like listening with the Galaxy Buds 3 FE when I'm in a relatively quiet environment, I find that the appeal withers slightly in the cacophony of New York City living. One of the biggest tests you can put a pair of ANC wireless earbuds through is New York's subway system—a gauntlet that I send almost every pair of wireless earbuds and headphones through—and in this case, I would say the Galaxy Buds 3 FE barely pass the test. I don't think that it's a passive noise cancellation issue—the default eartips feel comfortable—but even if it were, the Galaxy Buds 3 FE also only come with two tip sizes, which is notably less than other similarly priced competitors, which offer between three and five sizes. I'll give Samsung a little slack here if just because the last pair of ANC wireless earbuds that I tested are Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen), which cost $300 and are designed specifically to cancel the heck out of all the noise around you. They're the best at noise cancelling of any wireless earbuds I've put in my ears. While the Galaxy Buds 3 FE are fine for mild instances of noise cancellation—they're mostly fine on the sidewalk in New York when I'm walking place to place—they're not the wireless earbuds I would spring for on an airplane or during a loud New York City subway commute. There are levels to this stuff, after all. I think the best encapsulation of things that are just fine in these wireless earbuds is the squeeze and touch controls. Interestingly, Samsung includes two types of controls on the Galaxy Buds 3 FE. To adjust volume, you swipe up or down on the buds, while skipping tracks, pause/play, and turning ANC on and off are done through squeezing. Like any squeeze controls, you'll have to adjust to the sensitivity at first, but once you do, they work fine for the most part. I say “the most part” because I do find—because the Galaxy Buds 3 FE are so light—that squeezing them does jostle them in my ear a bit. They're not flying out mid-commute or anything, but squeezing does feel marginally more tenuous than on other pairs of wireless earbuds. Adding to that tenuousness, I think, is Samsung's “blade” design, which is borrowed from its flagship Galaxy Buds 3 Pro for this version of the FE. My complaint doesn't have anything to do with how the blade design copies AirPods—I actually like the look of the Galaxy Buds 3 FE—but one thing I don't like is how it feels on my fingers. It's a small tactile detail in the scheme of things, but as long as we're getting nerdy about this stuff, it's worth mentioning. I also like how they appear when they're in my ears, though the blade is a decent length and can sometimes end up sticking out if I don't properly put them in my ears. The buds are rated for 6 hours of battery life while ANC is activated and 8.5 hours when it's turned off, and with my usage, those estimates seem accurate. That's about the same battery you'd get with most wireless earbuds in this price range, give or take a half hour or so. Sorry folks, if the longest battery life is a priority, you'll just have to spend more money on wireless earbuds. Feature-wise, the Galaxy Buds 3 FE are decently equipped but not brimming. You get adaptive ANC, 360 audio (Samsung's version of spatial audio), transparency mode, and you can choose EQ presets in the Galaxy Wearable app, but there's no personalized tuning test like there is on the OnePlus Buds 4 or Nothing Ear. That last one is a bit of a bummer since personalized EQ can dramatically change the sound quality in my experience. But if you like Samsung's Galaxy products and you're more focused on quality sound over anything else, these might be your pick without costing too much.

Apple's third-gen ANC wireless earbuds seem like a worthwhile upgrade even compared to AirPods Pro 2. We just got a major tease of new features on Nothing's Ear 3. No, you shouldn't use it for multiplayer, but I still find myself gravitating to GeForce Now more than ever. Who should get your money, Apple or Google? AirPods Pro finally have a new generation and there are some notable differences over 2023's refresh. We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Revised spec now being sampled by Micron, Samsung, and SK. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Nvidia has reportedly cancelled its first-gen SOCAMM (System-on-Chip Attached Memory Module) rollout and is shifting development focus to a new version known as SOCAMM2. This is according to Korean outlet ETNews  citing unnamed industry sources. Based on a machine translation, the outlet claims that SOCAMM1 was halted after technical setbacks and that SOCAMM2 sample testing is now underway with all three major memory vendors. The abandonment of SOCAMM1, if accurate, resets what was expected to be a fast-tracked rollout of modular LPDDR-based memory in Nvidia's data center stack. SOCAMM has been positioned as a new class of high-bandwidth, low-power memory for AI servers, delivering similar benefits to HBM but at a lower cost. Nvidia itself has already listed SOCAMM in product documentation. Micron announced that it was the “first and only memory company” shipping SOCAMM products for AI servers in the data center back in March. Whether those plans were paused or simply evolving remains unclear. Nvidia has not commented on the report — and never comments on rumors in any case — and none of the memory vendors have confirmed a change in direction. But with demand for AI memory exploding, and HBM supply becoming more and more constrained, SOCAMM is shaping up to become a major component in Nvidia's silicon roadmap, making a jump from SOCAMM1 to SOCAMM2 a feasible move.

Cougar just released the CFV235 and CFV235 Mesh, a mid-tower PC case design that features a unique “Central Floating Ventilation” structure that physically separates your motherboard, CPU, and GPU from the PSU and SATA storage drives. According to ComputerBase, the gap between these two sections allows for 270 degrees of airflow, allowing the main compartment access to fresh air from four sides. With a setup like this, PC builders can ensure that both the CPU and GPU get cooler outside air for optimal cooling performance. This can make cleaning so much easier, and you don't have to worry about using a powerful blower to get dust off its surfaces and billowing into your room. And if that is not bling enough for you, you can get the Vision upgrade, which adds a 9.16-inch LCD monitor with a 1920 x 462 resolution at the side of the lower compartment. Of course, you should avoid installing a radiator at the bottom, as air bubbles can form on your AIO cooler's motor, leading to premature failure. Aside from all these cooling options, this case is also compatible with reverse-connector (BTF) motherboards, it supports GPUs up to 400mm long, and up to four 2.5-inch drives (or two 3.5-inch and two 2.5-inch storage drives). Of course, you might think that a cantilever design like this might not be as strong as the usual rectangular box PC case layout. But its 1.5-mm-thick frame should ensure that the chassis won't bend.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. WIRED Editor Amit Katwala has traveled far and wide for a hands-on look at the future of robotic artificial limbs, and the technological progress he witnessed is beyond impressive. As a broader product category, exoskeletons have the potential to enhance mobility for those with disabilities, helping them regain independence and improve their quality of life. But the likes of Hypershell produces nonmedical, wearable exoskeletons that promise muscle-boosting power for us average Joes. The majority of these designs, however, seem to be permanently on preorder, or ambitiously chasing the big bucks on Kickstarter, so it's refreshing to be able to test something that's available on Amazon. Last year I reviewed a prelaunch version of the similar DNSYS X1 (WIRED 5/10) and found it to be glitchy, heavy, and generally disappointing, but it did show promise. It remains stuck in preorder however, as does the much-publicized pair of $5,000 Arc'teryx MO/GO powered pants. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. There are currently three versions of the Hypershell exoskeleton: the basic 400-watt, $900 Hypershell Go X, the $1,199 Pro X which has a 800-watt output, 10.8-mile range, and enhanced capabilities for running and even cycling assistance. And then there's the Hypershell Carbon X, which uses a titanium alloy instead of carbon fiber and costs $1,500. The Go X offers 7.5 miles per hour maximum speed assistance while the Pro X's 800-watt motor can help up to speeds of 12.4 miles per hour. Each model collapses down to 16.9 × 10.2 × 4.9 inches, and the Go and Pro X weigh 4.41 pounds, while the Carbon version is 7 ounces lighter. I've been wearing the exoskeleton for the past few months while testing various outdoor gear, including hiking boots and rain jackets, and within seconds of turning it on I knew it was significantly more useful than the DNSYS X1, giving my legs a nice power-up on trails. Did I feel like a fool wearing it in public? Did my wife ask me “Why are you walking like Woody from Toy Story?” Yes. The lower back and hip cushioning is particularly good. I'm 5′ 11′′ tall, and most adults—Hypershell estimates 80 percent—will have no fitting issues. The excellent app takes you through the whole process, with step-by-step video instructions on adjusting to fit, and then once you're corseted in, it demos the various power modes and controls. When you first power on, the inert machine springs to life and tightens up, and once you've chosen a power mode, it instantly starts to work as you walk. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Using its multiple sensors, the Hypershell detects your leg movement and then makes the most of the motor to help lift your legs as you stride, with up to 32 newton-meters of torque. In Eco mode the effect is noticeable but not aggressive, but in the higher-torque settings, your leg will be propelled upwards. It feels odd and unnatural, like you're a bionic marionette. Hypershell claims its device offsets 30 kilograms, or 66 pounds of weight. Remember though, it is also having to compensate for its own weight, and while 4.4 pounds isn't prohibitively heavy, it's not something you want to add to your pack if the battery dies mid-hike. It also makes you walk a little oddly—I guess, robotically. This feels pretty great when locked into a nice pace, but it's not casual. To test this, I went for two hilly but not mountainous walks with a heart rate tracker on. First I checked my heart rate (83 bpm) and then hiked without the exoskeleton, and then, once my heart rate had returned to its previous level, hiked up again with the Pro X on the Eco mode, which is the standard level recommended. Comparing readings from my Garmin Epix Pro, my unassisted walk—1.8 miles in 28.57 minutes—registered an average speed of 6 km/h and an average heart rate of 102 bpm, with a max heart rate of 127 bpm. In contrast, when I repeated the route wearing the exoskeleton it took 28.19 minutes, with an average speed of 6.1 km/h and an average heart rate of 104 bpm, and maximum of 145 bpm. I was expecting the assisted walk to use less energy and therefore not peak my heart rate. Maybe I was walking faster, pushing myself harder with the robot help? Maybe I was nervous, or excited by the new tech, which pushed up my heart rate. But in truth this wasn't the first time I'd experienced these results. I did a similar test some weeks earlier, up a short, very steep hill with the Hypershell on full power. I was so surprised by the results—which, again, suggested it was taking me more effort with the exoskeleton than without—that I contacted the brand and they sent me a second unit to try, assuming this was a fault. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. I've seen reviews online that also compare heart rate data, and they've had more positive results, but I can only go on my own data and repeated experience. The Hypershell feels like it's helping me, and I like the leg boost, but is it really? It's also the only design currently for sale, so by that reckoning, it is undeniably the best. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. It drains quicker in the higher modes, however, and as mentioned earlier, I'd hate to have to carry it if the battery dies, so a spare is essential for longer multiday hikes. It's easier to control the exoskeleton via the app, which involves repeatedly reaching for my phone as I change terrain. The onboard controls are simple—it's one button—but remembering which setting and how many single-press and double-press actions I've done isn't as intuitive as I'd like. Oh and once you're strapped in, accessing trouser pockets is difficult. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. I was impressed by the overall comfort of the design, and while I'd love to be able to wear it under trousers, it's not that ostentatious. The raised battery and lower back section can interfere with backpacks, though, if they hang quite low. It's more a niggle than issue, but worth consideration. I'm also not convinced by the cycling and running modes. Maybe the AI will learn the difference in my stride or power, but for now it feels unnecessary. And of course, there's the heart rate tests which remain baffling. I do like the Fitness mode, however, which adds resistance as you walk, making it harder, and increasing my effort. Ironically though, based on my data, it seems that all the modes do this as standard. I still think the Hypershell Pro X can help you walk farther, especially on easier terrain, but as my tests show, it's not as useful if you're tackling difficult ascents. Maybe it's not a device for already active people. Maybe it can find an audience of older, or less able individuals who are keen to get out and explore more but need a bit of help. From my experience, exoskeletons continue to overpromise and underdeliver. The Hypershell Pro X is the best of a frustrating bunch, but it still feels disconnected from real-world needs. Why would able-bodied people spend big on a gadget to help their perfectly good legs? These devices have the potential to be like ebikes for the less able, and they would be better pitched as such, rather than expensive toys for the already active.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investigation appears to target 40nm interface and gate-driver ICs as import volumes rise and prices fall ahead of new U.S.–China trade talks. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. China has launched an anti-dumping investigation into American-made analog chips, claiming U.S. manufacturers have undercut local vendors on price while flooding the market with mature-node parts. The move targets essential low-end ICs used in PC boards, routers, PSUs, and other gear assembled in China, and comes just as U.S. and Chinese officials prepare to meet for a fresh round of trade talks in Madrid. The investigation, initiated by the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) on September 13, covers interface and gate-driver ICs built on legacy processes at 40nm or larger. The petitioner, an industry group based in Jiangsu Province, is requesting that duties be applied. The review period encompasses transactions during 2024, with an injury window extending back three years. Any of these things could ripple into minor BOM changes and redesigns for 2026 product cycles. In parallel, China also announced an “anti-discrimination” investigation into alleged U.S. trade practices that limit Chinese chipmakers' ability to compete abroad. That inquiry will look into whether Washington's export controls and investment bans violate global trade norms. A typical timeline suggests that it'll take roughly three months for the inquiry to complete. But the broader market trend post-COVID was already one of heavy correction, with oversupply driving down margins across the mature-node segment. MOFCOM says the anti-dumping case will conclude by September 13, 2026, though it can be extended by another six months if needed. Provisional duties, if imposed, could land well before then.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nintendo doesn't normally let fans in on its hardware plans, but if you're the type of person to spot trends, it's clear the Switch 2 will become the Mario maker's everything console. Nintendo has started offering more hardware specifically tailored for playing its old, defunct consoles. Today, Nintendo decided it was time to bring back what is likely its least popular gaming hardware it ever released. The $100 Virtual Boy for Switch 2 revives Nintendo's first use of stereoscopic visuals and the odd bipod-mounted headset for playing them. While the Virtual Boy was Nintendo's worst-selling console ever—only managing to move 770,000 units in its lifetime—the company's top-selling device is still MIA from the Nintendo Classics list. Last month, Mike Odyssey on X spotted that Nintendo had updated the patent for 2025. Patents don't suggest a company will actually make the product, only that they're exploring ideas and want to protect them. Even if Nintendo is working on a dual-screen add-on for the Switch 2, that doesn't necessarily mean the finished product would look anything like this proposed design. Now that Nintendo has gone back 30 years to its strangest console, it opens the possibility of winding back the clock to every instance of its past hardware. The Switch 2 has more capacity for these peripherals thanks to its top and bottom USB-C ports. A move toward more Switch 2 retro peripherals makes more sense when you understand why Nintendo keeps publishing its classic library for Switch owners. Retro emulators, which recreate older consoles as software, are growing increasingly popular with the generation of gamers who grew up with Nintendo's older consoles. Nintendo is also one of the few companies that rails hardest against emulation in its crusade to combat piracy and protect its intellectual property. Nintendo has taken down multiple Switch emulators, including Ryujinx, Citra, and—especially—Yuzu. Nintendo has hindered GameCube emulator Dolphin from a full release on Steam. While players have too much choice for Game Boy-like devices, the DS and 3DS are still new territory. In the last few months, Ayaneo showed off its Pocket DS, a dual-screen Android handheld made for playing DS games. Fellow handheld maker AYN announced its Thor dual-screen device as well. Nintendo will take its time to launch even more hardware. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present. You can also buy a cardboard version of the Virtual Boy if you don't want the full setup. Retro Studios is bringing 'Metroid Prime 4' and Samus' cool new motorcycle Viola to the Nintendo Switch systems just in time for the holidays. Actor Chris Pratt will return to voice the beloved plumber. No, you shouldn't use it for multiplayer, but I still find myself gravitating to GeForce Now more than ever.

While it's all fine and dandy to take care of them when the summer sun is shining, keeping your plants alive in winter can feel like a whole 'nother story. Being a houseplant enthusiast is akin to having several silent children, all with finicky needs and limited ways of communicating them. If your green thumb is feeling a little yellow or brown these days, fear not! “Perhaps we forget the fact that what may look like a struggling plant today could be thriving in, let's say, three to four weeks, if we give it a chance.” He adds, “Nine times out of 10, your plants are OK and don't really need much from you. In fact, you might be doing them more bad than good by being a hummingbird plant parent (I just made that up, it's kind of like helicopter parenting, but for plants).” Tatiana Anderson, cofounder of Top Tropicals, says not to panic if growth slows or a few leaves drop. “What you want to see is steady color, firm leaves, and no major changes," she says. “One of the biggest issues with house plants is overwatering, which can lead to problems like root rot," says Wheat. "This is especially challenging during the winter months,” And it can be even trickier if your plants are outside during the warmer months. But that doesn't mean you need to water plants more in winter. Justin Hancock, Costa Farms horticulturist, says to be wary if you usually water your plants on a schedule. “If you're used to giving them a fixed amount of water every week, you could inadvertently overwater in winter if they don't drink that much. If you're in doubt, it's almost always better to let houseplants get a little too dry than to keep them consistently too wet.” And, according to Andrew Connolly, founder of Little Flower Cottage, you should “try to always use room temperature water, as really cold water can shock the plant.” He adds that “overwatering is the fastest way to lose a plant in the winter.” Anup Mutalik, chief editor at Houseplants Nook, says, “We always do the finger test and water only when the top 2 inches are dry. Overwatering is a bigger risk in winter, because evaporation slows down. For most plants, we cut back to watering once every 15 days!” Wheat advises to make sure your plants aren't bone-dry or soaking wet. “Get to know the weight of your pot when it is dry and watered,” he says. “A simple change you make can take days or weeks to show an impact.” Move your plants close to windows so they can get enough light. An east-, or southeast- to southwest-facing window can provide this. If you don't have any windows providing sunlight, artificial light will no doubt be a requirement,” says Wheat. Make sure the windowsill doesn't drop below about 55 [degrees Fahrenheit] or so; cooler temperatures than that can stress some species.” Connelly recommends rotating plants every week or so, too. “Basically all sides need to get roughly the same amount of light.” Every expert I spoke with recommended snagging a few inexpensive full-spectrum grow lights to supplement your plants during the winter. Mutalik says, “You can just buy a couple grow lamps and keep rotating plants in and out of them so you don't invest too much at once.” Experts also recommend ensuring that your plants' leaves are free of dust, which blocks the light. Hancock points out that dust can accumulate faster in the winter due to drier air and the use of furnaces or other heat sources like fireplaces. You can gently wipe them with a soft, damp cloth or use a specialty tool designed for the purpose, like Goha's microfiber Leaf Sweep, above. Hancock says that, similarly to how humans can experience dry skin and chapped lips in the winter, plants can feel the effects of low humidity and dry air, too—especially plants with thinner leaves. He recommends boosting humidity by “investing in a small humidifier or grouping plants together, [since] they release moisture in the air as they breathe.” He also says that most plants are comfortable with the same humidity you are—about 40 to 60 percent. It's not enough to actually help the plant, unfortunately,” says Hancock. “If leaf edges turn brown or curl, that's usually a humidity cry for help,” per Mutalik. “We keep humidity-loving plants like calatheas, ferns, and marantas grouped together on pebble trays and run a humidifier nearby.” (Our WIRED-tested favorite is above.) We already covered that you should monitor the warmth near your windows to ensure it doesn't drop below 55 degrees Fahrenheit. But ambient air temperatures can affect your houseplants as well. “If you're feeling chilly, your plants probably are, too,” says Hancock. “If you have a houseplant near a heating vent where it's getting exposed to air that's noticeably warmer or cooler than the ambient air temperature, it can stress your plant, causing leaves to yellow prematurely,” says Hancock. Connolly points out that heating vents and space heaters can be detrimental, too. Awareness is key when it comes to heat and airflow. “We keep anything leafy or tropical at least 2 feet away from heaters and ensure windows are well-insulated,” says Mutalik. If you're bringing your plants indoors from outside, experts recommend quarantining them for a period of time to ensure they aren't hosting any pests that could affect your other houseplants. “Catching them early saves a lot of heartache,” says Anderson. Check under every leaf for mites, mealybugs, or gnats. If you encounter pests, there are a few ways of addressing them that can vary based on preference and plant species. Wheat removes them manually if possible, and wipes them down with a cloth or a light vinegar solution before moving on to other, more aggressive measures like horticultural oils or soaps if needed. (Editor Kat Merck uses the insecticidal soap above on her houseplants and hydroponic gardens.) Connolly wipes plants down with a cloth and then rinses them in the sink. And Mutalik says that Neem oil or castile soap can work wonders if you catch the pests early; wipe the leaves, especially broader leaves, every two weeks to prevent infection. While many winter pests hitch a ride indoors, Hancock points out that dry, warm conditions (like those found in heated homes in winter) are the ideal environment for spider mites. Fertilizer is always a little confusing, and it can be even more puzzling in the wintertime. “I would say, don't even bother to fertilize your house plant if you're using an over-the-counter potting soil. Most of these soils have slow-release fertilizer in them that is sufficient for plant growth,” says Wheat. If you have an older plant with tired soil, or a particularly “heavy feeder,” you can opt for a slow or controlled-release fertilizer—or just repot it with fresh soil. (But be aware that winter isn't usually the best time to repot a plant, and you may want to wait until the growing season arrives.) “We pause all fertilizing during the winter dormancy period, unless a plant is actively growing (like some pothos or philodendrons that surprise us).” He says that feeding a dormant plant stresses it out, similarly to overwatering, and can cause leaf burn or browning edges. Over winter, what you want is a stable, calm plant. And if you do notice something going awry, it's best to make small adjustments rather than throwing the book of problem-solving at your houseplants. Gradual changes are the best way to help a plant bounce back, rather than risking stressing it further. There are even apps that claim to help you figure out what's wrong with your plants. (I'm testing a few out and will recommend one in an upcoming guide.) Winter gives way to spring and your plants go through cycles where they make look ‘happy' or 'sad' but it's all part of any plant's natural lifecycle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some of the most urgent films at this year's Toronto International Film Festival aren't here to soothe. These films, the first two of which are documentaries, don't just entertain—they confront fractured humanity, closeness and distance under Israel's siege of Gaza, and a creation we've set loose, growing beyond our control. That's the one muscle of film—to interrogate rather than facilitate. Director Raoul Peck, who gave us 2016's I Am Not Your Negro, didn't make Orwell: 2+2=5 to feel like a documentary in the usual sense—it's a dare, the sort of blunt truth authoritarian regimes treat like contraband. The film portrays a slow-creep march around authoritarianism, not from an academic distance, but as an unsettling, visceral lesson in the here and now. Picture British actor Damian Lewis reading George Orwell's final musings—his letters, essays, diaries—with an almost clinical cadence. These reflections are layered over raw, jarring images: Gaza in ruins, Donald Trump's distorted truths, and the online mechanics of misinformation that enable our tendencies to ignore the unimaginable. “That's unfortunately our capacity … to forget, our capacity to repress,” says Peck, who was born in Haiti, a country shaped by authoritarian rule. And yet the whole German society, the whole European society, did not believe him—they felt he was a joke.” They thought, well, our modern world cannot go that far down. Words such as “doublespeak” (language designed to obscure or mislead), “newspeak” (a controlled vocabulary to limit thought), “thoughtcrime” (the criminalization of dissenting ideas), and “freedom is slavery” (the manipulation of truth to enforce obedience) populate the screen, overlaid on contemporary images of conflict, political spectacle, and media manipulation. “Orwell grew up in the exterior of that world,” he says. It was human.” For Peck, Orwell's essays, particularly “Why I Write,” revealed a writer's consciousness of his role in confronting injustice—a sensibility that informs every frame of Orwell: 2+2=5. Peck frames Orwell in the digital age: “It's basically Orwell's world with the instruments to do it easier today. How can you gain power and control everything? Authoritarian terrorism means that you want to rewrite history. Just give a prompt and you've created a different path.” He stresses that Orwell's analysis was grounded in real regimes, not prophecy: “You just apply it to your current situation, and redo the analysis.” In other words, the film forces us—beautifully, uncomfortably—to face what we'd rather deny: that a writer, equal parts truth and fiction teller, could imagine a future that now feels like our present. Our self-portrait is stitched not just from Orwell's sly warnings about power, but from the nightmare we still insist is only fiction. Where Orwell: 2+2=5 warns us about the apathy toward authoritarianism, Farsi's Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk forces us to confront the daily realities of living under military control—specifically, in Gaza. Through her camera and voice, Farsi discovered the only window she could open. “I have never had such a deep relationship with someone whom I've never met … this feeling of being blocked in a country you cannot leave,” Farsi tells WIRED. But Hassouna's smile, threading its way entirely through video calls and fractured connections over the course of 112 minutes, renders that goal impossible. The opening shots of Hassouna and Farsi introducing themselves anchor the film in this perspective, which not only feels personal but very social. Through the film, Hassouna comes alive not just as a photographer but as a witness to life insisting itself into being. Their conversations flicker in and out—bad connections, cut-offs, pixelated resolutions. “By keeping these pauses and disconnections, I'm conveying something very strange about the way we connect to Gaza, because Gaza is not reachable, and yet it is. Making the film for Farsi was much like living in two worlds at once: recording Hassouna from afar, sure, but also being closely present as a friend, witness, and human being. “I had to remain natural, but also somehow controlled as a filmmaker. The film, in that sense, is a strong picture of Palestinian humanity—something mainstream media outlets have historically failed to portray—as shown through Hassouna. As months pass, Farsi and Hassouna's conversations confront the harsh realities of life under siege: constant bombings, sniper fire, days without food, as told by Hassouna. I had to concentrate on the human facing me in a different way,” says Farsi. “There is a virtue to show, and if we do not, how would people find out about it?” Farsi remembers Hassouna's smile—playful, melancholy, in poetry or sunlight. Even in hunger or fatigue, she would smile. Put Your Soul offers no tidy closure by the end of its run time—because there is none to give. On April 16, 2025, just a day after the film's Cannes selection, Hassouna was killed with 10 family members, including her pregnant sister, in an Israeli airstrike on their home in Gaza City's Al-Tuffah neighborhood. Her death renders the film both as a memorial and an indictment. As Farsi reflects, “When the film was finished, I thought that together we had achieved something. I really travel a lot with the film, and it's weird to be presenting it alone without Fatim to talk about her in such an intense way. Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein puts creation under the microscope. Like Mary Shelley before him, del Toro revives a tortured genius, where monstrosity and humanity are kin. Oscar Isaac's Victor Frankenstein sheds the simplicity of villainy, revealing the messy truths of a man who is both creator and creature. As Del Toro told Variety at Cannes in May: “Somebody asked me the other day, does it have really scary scenes? Del Toro reanimates the well-worn tale of science gone unchecked and ambition outpacing our capacity to reckon. Gothic-darkened labs and ornate wardrobes frame the creature (Jacob Elordi), whose scars are smoothed, jawline sculpted—calibrated for sympathy. Del Toro doesn't revive Shelley's horror; he asks viewers to feel for a creation that should repel them. To be clear, much of Frankenstein is theatrical as hell, balancing Shelley's lessons with the sentimental flourish of a Del Toro signature. It leans on familiar motifs of forgiveness and our capacity to self-correct, sometimes without fully earning these moments. Again, Frankenstein is not an explicit message movie like the two above, but it is in Hollywood form, sounding an alarm during the in-between flashiness of a big studio film. Like Frankenstein, who stitched life from what should not live, we now hover on the edge of our own experiment, with AI promising to remake the world in ways that terrify, seduce, and elude our moral imagination. Like Victor, who's warned about the dangers of his inner Prometheus by love interest Elizabeth Lavenza (Mia Goth), the architects of our artificial minds—the Sam Altmans, Demis Hassabis, Elon Musks—move in a space between awe and terror, crafting intelligences that mirror us back with uncanny precision, and with a threat that feels both abstract and immediate. It forces us to reckon with the weight of creation, to sit with the responsibility of what we bring into being. But in the shadow of ChatGPT, AlphaFold, and Neuralink, it's hard to miss an allegory that wouldn't apply to any other decade: the exhilaration of invention, the seduction of power, and the precariousness of a life—artificial or otherwise—that escapes our grasp, demanding we consider what it means to make, to care for, and to witness what we make and enable.
