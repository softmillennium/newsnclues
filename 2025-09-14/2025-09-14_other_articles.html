                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At the Journal on Thursday, professional writer Daniel Kagan Kans  took aim at theoretical physicist Sabine Hossenfelder and others as conspiracy theorists about physics: In recent years, a group of YouTubers and podcasters have attracted millions of viewers by proclaiming that physics is in crisis. The field, they argue, has discovered little of importance in the last 50 years, because it is dominated by groupthink and silences anyone who dares to dissent from mainstream ideas, like string theory. String theory has not in fact gone anywhere, a fact that Kans admits below the fold: “String theory has not fulfilled physicists' early dreams that it would become the ultimate explanation of all forces and matter in our universe.” Dissenting physicists are bound to notice how much time, energy, and money so grand a theory sucks up while it flounders. If physicists are starting to “worry about the consequences” of discussing long-term theory failure, it is reasonable to think that there are even more serious problems within the discipline. Late last month, as we reported, there was a nasty exchange between Johns Hopkins University cosmologist Sean Carroll and mathematical physicist Eric Weinstein. Piers framed his segment as “For centuries, scientists have grappled with the most fundamental question of them all – what is reality? And what was there before the Big Bang created the world we live in?” He pointed to Einstein and quantum physics, implying that a deep discussion would follow. But Carroll trashed Weinstein's theory as “a dog-ate-my-homework kind of thing.” It wasn't a display that would cause viewers (nearly a million of them) to have much confidence in the theoretical physics establishment. Einstein, Bohr, and Heisenberg seem like distant memories here… … [6:34] Eric is only one person who wrote up some notes. If he had wasted some millions of tax money on hiring postdocs and writing papers about it then he could have easily papered over these shortcomings, just like everyone else in that area. Sean totally knows that most of his colleagues work on similarly flaky stuff, it's just been covered up by more working hours. The literature is full of papers without proper predictions without Lagrangians, ill-defined operators or problems that will be solved in some “future work” that never comes. Because they're all tied up in the same scam. Unless the person who comes up with the idea is Eric Weinstein, in which case it's suddenly hugely offensive and everyone starts yelling. Sabine Hossenfelder, Physicists are afraid of Eric Weinstein — and they should be. But how did this back-and-forth raise concerns about “conspiracy physics”? Hossenfelder's accusations are consistent with a situation in physics where the star theory, string theory, has gone nowhere for decades. Career paths for physicists are vanishing or leading overseas. There's a dawning awareness, Carroll says, of how much the field depends on public legitimacy. Leonard Susskind, director of the Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics, says physicists need to be both more sober and more forceful when addressing the public. The limits of string theory should be acknowledged, he says, but the idea that progress has slowed isn't right. If the physics establishment is only just now becoming aware that public funding depends on public legitimacy, well, no time like the present. And carrying on about conspiracy theories will not stand in for actual achievements. We asked experimental physicist Rob Sheldon what he makes of all this. They are sincere physicists, searching for truth, albeit in places I have dismissed already. Now there are both good and bad conspiracies. The one point we can be agreed on, is that one lunatic does not make a conspiracy, it takes at least 2. So how can we tell truth from conspiracy? As every physicist will explain, we don't work with truth, we work with data, hypotheses, models, mathematical approximations. So, as scientists struggle to make sense of the physical world, governments struggle over how to apportion taxpayers' money — which no one enjoys as a personal right. It's too bad if Wall Street Journal chooses to platform an attack on dissenting physicists instead of discussing these matters in a more straightforward way.

Burlison said the video, provided by a whistleblower and as of yet unconfirmed, was taken October 30, 2024, when an M-9 Reaper drone was allegedly tracking an “orb” off the coast of Yemen. “Greenlight given to engage, missile appears to be ineffective against the target,” Burlison said in an post on X.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the weather gets colder and Halloween slowly approaches, a comfort show like Supernatural is a perfect binge for fall. Nothing gets one into the spooky mindset quite like the early years of Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester's (Jensen Ackles) extended hunting career, as they tackle ghosts, demons, and monsters on the daily. For an excellent episode that's simply perfect for audiences getting ready for the spooky season to officially commence, there's no better case than that of a cursed mirror with a spectral force that nearly finished the Winchesters: Season 1's "Bloody Mary." The Season 1 context is one of heightened tension, especially since Sam looks for an emotional anchor in each case, often tying back to his grief over his recently deceased girlfriend Jessica (Adrianne Palicki). In this tale, that grief manifests itself in a powerful and dangerous way as the brothers encounter the titular vengeful spirit "Bloody" Mary Worthington (Jovanna Huguet). Like many of Supernatural's earliest hours, "Bloody Mary" feels like it's been ripped straight out of a horror movie. Perhaps one of the scariest episodes of the entire series, this Season 1 thriller creatively uses reflective surfaces to make its vengeful spirit a threat that feels impossible to escape. Able to jump mirror-to-mirror, Bloody Mary haunts her victims before taking on their form, before liquifying their eyeballs to the point of death. Whether her initial faceless form (covered by her long hair, a la Samara Morgan) gives you the chills or you're haunted by the concept of an evil mirror self with bleeding eyes, there's no denying that "Bloody Mary" is still considered one of Supernatural's most terrifying episodes by fans. To this day, many still regard it as one of the show's best, helping set the initial tone and stretch the limits of how personal these weekly horror stories could actually be. Because the evil spirit only kills those with a dark secret, "Bloody Mary" leverages Sam's guilt and pain following Jessica's death to its advantage, introducing a story element that would establish the younger Winchester's psychic premonitions later in the season. After all, who hasn't been dared to recite "Bloody Mary" alone in a dark room in front of the mirror at least once as a kid? While there are many Supernatural episodes out there with decent premises that don't quite stick the landing ("Bugs" or "Bloodlines," anyone? ), "Bloody Mary" is certainly not one of them. After Sam is nearly consumed by the evil spirit, who has begun to punish him for his secret about Jessica, Dean shatters the mirror. If seeing Bloody Mary on reflective surfaces throughout the episode was enough of a fright, then this sequence will put you over the edge. It manages to make the threat appear terribly real. It proved any naysayers wrong that these types of urban legend thrills could be told in a weekly television format, and surpassed scares previously seen on shows like The X-Files or Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It's no wonder that "Bloody Mary" became one of Supernatural's most memorable episodes. In fact, when Chuck (Rob Benedict) brought back some of the brothers' most formidable opponents in Season 15, the spirit of Mary Worthington (with Jovanna Huguet reprising her role) was one of them. Of course, Supernatural had changed so much by then that her final season scares didn't land as effectively as they did back in Season 1. In fact, when speaking with the Chicago Tribune about the series back in 2008, creator Eric Kripke admitted as such. Frights like Season 1's "Scarecrow" or the body-horror freak-out "Skin" added layers to the brothers' relationship while still delivering memorable monsters that would leave a mark on fans for years to come. No doubt, Supernatural definitely found its own unique voice over the years. There are plenty of great episodes of the show that don't feel too horror-esque at all, and that's a good thing. But over time, Supernatural lost its ability to deliver consistently on the horror train, making episodes like "Bloody Mary" feel almost like relics. Still, they make for great binges this time of year, so don't miss out on the types of stories that originally launched Supernatural into the public eye. Two brothers follow their father's footsteps as hunters, fighting evil supernatural beings of many kinds, including monsters, demons, and gods that roam the earth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Buried in all the news this week was another congressional hearing on UFOs. For some reason, our government now prefers the acronym UAP, which stood for Unidentified Aerial Phenomena until they changed it again Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. So, in other words, an unidentified flying object or UFO, right? The highlight of this week's congressional hearing was a leaked military video purportedly taken by a U.S. military MQ-9 Reaper Drone showing a hellfire missile striking sphere-like object in the skies off the coast of Yemen and having little to no effect. I sought out some experts in the field. But he had questions similar to mine. I spoke to a family member who served several tours in Afghanistan and he told me there is a chain of command and permission needed before a Hellfire Missile is fired. "I believe those are the most pertinent questions, but upon seeing this footage we also have to ask ourselves, what sort of technology could cause this result? The Hellfire Missile was designed for anti-armor attacks and is able to destroy any known armored vehicle in the world, and it lost. The target, while it seemed to lose a few bits and veered from its course momentarily, rebounded almost immediately and kept going. That's not a known technology we have here on Earth ... unless something else is being hidden from us, militarily or otherwise." Was it finally time to build my bunker in the backyard? Were the monsters really due on Maple Street? Not so fast, says Adam Frank, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Rochester whose research delves into Theoretical Astrophysics, and in particular the hydrodynamic and magneto-hydrodynamic evolution of matter. Frank said there are way too many unknowns to make any sort of scientific declaration based on what he described as a "grainy video with blobs on it that comes with a predigested story." "If you really want to know what it is, you've got to do a proper investigation of it," he said. "That means knowing what time of day is it? The other thing to take into account, Frank said, was that the object was not moving very fast since Hellfire Missiles are used mainly to attack stationary or slower-moving objects like tanks and helicopters. But the biggest takeaway from my discussion with Frank was something I hadn't noticed on the video or even considered. "It's not like you see the missile hit whatever the thing was and explode in a giant explosion and then the thing propagates away from it like in one of those science fiction movies," Frank said. "It looks like it's a glancing blow right which means that the targeting wasn't that great. You see it move, so this is not some kind of super alien technology which is impervious to anything, it kind of behaves like you might expect something to behave if it got a glancing blow from a fast moving object." OK, so maybe it's not from outer space. Florida Congresswoman and chair of Declassification of Federal Secrets Anna Paulina Luna, R-Florida, wants to know as well. She has been calling on the government to be more transparent when it comes to these types of things. "From Roswell to the coast of Jacksonville, the sightings of UFO's have rarely been explained by the people who have first-hand accounts of these situations," she said last year. "This is largely due to the lack of transparency by our own government and the failure of our elected leaders to make good on their promises to release explanations and footage and mountains of classified documents that continue to be hidden from the American people." I've only recently come across the term “Peer State Adversary,” meaning a country with similar technology as ours that is adversarial. Anyway, more likely than an alien spacecraft, the object on the video could be a drone operated by one of those adversarial countries. And if that's the case, Frank explains, the military would have good reason to keep tight-lipped about it. For example, Frank said, what if a country like China or Iran was testing the camera-spoofing technology of an experimental drone? Our military leaders would not want to tip their hand and reveal to those nations what we know about them. “As somebody who studies the possibility of life in the universe professionally, I would love if we found aliens," Frank said. "That would answer the question I've been interested in my whole life. But there's just nothing there to be able to make that giant leap without the right kind of scientific evidence." I gotta admit being relieved after speaking with Frank. Support local journalism and become a subscriber.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Buried in all the news this week was another congressional hearing on UFOs. For some reason, our government now prefers the acronym UAP, which stood for Unidentified Aerial Phenomena until they changed it again Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. So, in other words, an unidentified flying object or UFO, right? The highlight of this week's congressional hearing was a leaked military video purportedly taken by a U.S. military MQ-9 Reaper Drone showing a hellfire missile striking sphere-like object in the skies off the coast of Yemen and having little to no effect. I sought out some experts in the field. But he had questions similar to mine. I spoke to a family member who served several tours in Afghanistan and he told me there is a chain of command and permission needed before a Hellfire Missile is fired. "I believe those are the most pertinent questions, but upon seeing this footage we also have to ask ourselves, what sort of technology could cause this result? The Hellfire Missile was designed for anti-armor attacks and is able to destroy any known armored vehicle in the world, and it lost. The target, while it seemed to lose a few bits and veered from its course momentarily, rebounded almost immediately and kept going. That's not a known technology we have here on Earth ... unless something else is being hidden from us, militarily or otherwise." Was it finally time to build my bunker in the backyard? Were the monsters really due on Maple Street? Not so fast, says Adam Frank, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Rochester whose research delves into Theoretical Astrophysics, and in particular the hydrodynamic and magneto-hydrodynamic evolution of matter. Frank said there are way too many unknowns to make any sort of scientific declaration based on what he described as a "grainy video with blobs on it that comes with a predigested story." "If you really want to know what it is, you've got to do a proper investigation of it," he said. "That means knowing what time of day is it? The other thing to take into account, Frank said, was that the object was not moving very fast since Hellfire Missiles are used mainly to attack stationary or slower-moving objects like tanks and helicopters. But the biggest takeaway from my discussion with Frank was something I hadn't noticed on the video or even considered. "It's not like you see the missile hit whatever the thing was and explode in a giant explosion and then the thing propagates away from it like in one of those science fiction movies," Frank said. "It looks like it's a glancing blow right which means that the targeting wasn't that great. You see it move, so this is not some kind of super alien technology which is impervious to anything, it kind of behaves like you might expect something to behave if it got a glancing blow from a fast moving object." OK, so maybe it's not from outer space. Florida Congresswoman and chair of Declassification of Federal Secrets Anna Paulina Luna, R-Florida, wants to know as well. She has been calling on the government to be more transparent when it comes to these types of things. "From Roswell to the coast of Jacksonville, the sightings of UFO's have rarely been explained by the people who have first-hand accounts of these situations," she said last year. "This is largely due to the lack of transparency by our own government and the failure of our elected leaders to make good on their promises to release explanations and footage and mountains of classified documents that continue to be hidden from the American people." I've only recently come across the term “Peer State Adversary,” meaning a country with similar technology as ours that is adversarial. Anyway, more likely than an alien spacecraft, the object on the video could be a drone operated by one of those adversarial countries. And if that's the case, Frank explains, the military would have good reason to keep tight-lipped about it. For example, Frank said, what if a country like China or Iran was testing the camera-spoofing technology of an experimental drone? Our military leaders would not want to tip their hand and reveal to those nations what we know about them. “As somebody who studies the possibility of life in the universe professionally, I would love if we found aliens," Frank said. "That would answer the question I've been interested in my whole life. But there's just nothing there to be able to make that giant leap without the right kind of scientific evidence." I gotta admit being relieved after speaking with Frank. Support local journalism and become a subscriber.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The search for extraterrestrial life represents one of humanity's most profound scientific quests—one that could fundamentally reshape our understanding of our place in the universe. Yet current telescopes face an almost impossible challenge: separating the faint glow of planets from stars that greatly outshine them. Unlike current circular telescopes like the Hubble or the James Webb, this design is a long rectangle, about 66 feet long by 3.3 feet tall. According to a new research study published in Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences, the new design will be able to detect a record number of habitable planets in a record time span, while being easier to implement and less expensive than current and future generation of space telescopes. Expanding to 46 target stars within 108 light-years, the mission could identify 27 potentially habitable worlds in 3.5 years—meeting NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory goal at a fraction of the cost and complexity. Newberg's design abandons the centuries-old assumption that telescopes must be circular. This is how it works: Imagine you're trying to spot a firefly sitting next to a giant searchlight from miles away—that's essentially what astronomers face when hunting for planets around other stars. Stars are so blindingly bright that any planets orbiting them get completely washed out. To image the planet alone, the telescope uses a device called an Achromatic Interfero Coronagraph—a well-known astronomical device that is basically a sophisticated light-blocking system that works like noise-canceling headphones, but for starlight instead of sound. The beauty is that this technique only needs to dim the star by about a million times (which sounds impossible but is actually pretty manageable with current technology), rather than the billion-times dimming required when looking at regular visible light. And here is where the magic comes in: Unlike circular telescopes that provide uniform resolution in all directions, the rectangular design concentrates its resolving power along a single axis. This is done with a sensor that only looks at a specific type of invisible light called infrared (think heat vision) at a wavelength of about 0.0004 inches, which is where planets that could support life naturally glow the brightest from their own heat. The problem of this approach is that you need to keep the telescope in a perfectly still point in space at all times while it rotates. The telescope needs to stay pointed in exactly the right direction with mind-boggling precision: if it drifts off course by even 1.25×10−9 radians—the width of a human hair viewed from 500 miles away—the whole observation gets ruined. This is actually four times more precise than the already incredibly steady James Webb Space Telescope, and the reason is simple physics—because this new telescope can see finer details along one direction, it's like having a more powerful zoom lens that amplifies every tiny wobble, so the whole system has to be that much more rock-solid to compensate. The design faces other technical uncertainties around structural stability, thermal control, and vibration management across its 66-foot span. However, these challenges are comparable to those NASA solved for Webb's segmented mirror system. The space agency has extensive capabilities for “high-fidelity modeling and environmental test (cryovac and vibration)” that would apply directly to the rectangular design. Other engineering challenges, while significant, appear solvable with existing technology too. “I have asked scientists to be more expert in space telescope vibration, flexion, and thermal stability and have gotten responses ranging from ‘might be a problem' to ‘not a problem.' No one has seen an obvious reason that this would not work,” Newberg tells me. The LUVOIR (Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor), for example, proposes two concepts resembling James Webb, with segmented hexagonal mirrors assembled in a circle, one 26 feet in diameter, the other 49 feet. They will be equipped with an ultra-high-contrast coronagraph capable of blocking starlight by ten billion to one. Moving this enormous shadow between target stars would require immense fuel expenditure. Another radical approach is the European LIFE mission, which calls for a swarm of small telescopes flying in perfect formation, always coordinated with each other. But if the position accuracy of Newberg's design is a challenge, LIFE's requirements are nuts. Newberg claims that her team's design avoids all the pitfalls of its rivals. “I would argue that my concept is the ‘conservative' one for identifying nearby, habitable exoplanets,” she tells me. “Neither the LUVOIR or HabEx proposals were selected in the National Academies Committee for a Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020 because they knew that the technology was not mature enough to develop a reasonable time and cost estimate for these missions” She also told me that the new design will be perfect to quickly detect the alien life candidates for more detailed observations in the future: “These more complex observatories require more time to develop the technology, and would benefit from a curated list of very interesting targets to observe,” she says. One limitation of its rectangular design is that it produces elongated “cigar-shaped” point sources rather than round images. “If the Hubble Space Telescope was rectangular, all of those beautiful images would look smeared out in one direction, so that each of the stars would be cigar-shaped,” Newberg acknowledges. For exoplanet hunting, this limitation proves irrelevant—separating two point sources matters more than image aesthetics. So yes, the planets can be seen as separated from their stars, just not the way you'd see them with your naked eye (although the images will likely be processed into photos that look normal for public use). Newberg says the cost advantages of this design are substantial compared to any other. While still requiring approximately $1 billion—making it a major space mission—the rectangular telescope would cost significantly less than alternatives demanding new technologies or multiple spacecraft. The simpler design reduces both development risks and operational complexity, potentially accelerating the timeline to first results by decades compared to more ambitious concepts. The rectangular concept could revolutionize high-resolution space astronomy beyond this single mission. The same principle could work at different wavelengths—a 66-foot rectangular mirror observing in visible light could theoretically detect Earth-like planets out to 650 light-years, though with far greater technical challenges. However, the reach of roughly 100 light-years is exactly what's needed for humanity's next dream. Within around 100 light-years of Earth lie the only stars we could realistically explore with robotic probes on human timescales. “The rectangular telescope could provide a straightforward path towards identifying our sister planet: Earth 2.0,” Newberg says.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What distinguishes music above all else is its power to shape how we feel From that point on I was hooked by the wonders of the universe and ended up doing a PhD in astronomy, before becoming a freelance science writer. She was a talented amateur soprano and used to sing these wonderful arias and other classical songs in full voice while doing jobs around the house. Later in life she developed Alzheimer's as a result of which she forgot who her family was, didn't recognise herself in the mirror, and would get lost in her own home. Yet if a song came on the radio that she'd known when young, she'd join in, somehow accurately remembering both lyrics and tune. There's something about music that's unique, artistically and neurologically. And to a scientist that makes it intriguing. Almost 20 years ago, I decided to delve more into music by taking singing lessons and beginning to write my own songs, some of which eventually found their way onto an album I recorded called Songs of the Cosmos. And so, through these various influences coming together, I was led to write my latest book – A Perfect Harmony: Music, Mathematics and Science. Musical scales, not unlike those used in popular songs today, were known at the time of the first cities in Mesopotamia, more than 5,000 years ago. Through music, patterns of numbers are infused with passion and life. Underpinned by maths, music gains structure and sense. Define music how you will – in terms of tones, rhythm, melody or harmony – what distinguishes it above all else is its power to shape how we feel and even send shivers down our spine. From ancient times to the late Middle Ages, music was a core subject in all forms of higher learning. It was on an equal footing with geometry, arithmetic and astronomy in the ‘quadrivium', which was the cornerstone of liberal arts education. Recent research on the benefits of music has shown that studying music and, especially, playing an instrument, helps with language processing, memory retention, maths and social-skills development. Seniors who take up the piano or another instrument, or simply sing along with others in a choir, appear to be more resistant to age-related cognitive and memory problems. One reason for this might be the creation of alternative connections in the brain that can compensate for mental decline as we get older. In a world where an increasing amount of social interaction takes place online community singing is remarkably effective at establishing broad, face-to-face social networks. Increasing evidence suggests that in-person social connections can play a vital role in maintaining health. In light of mounting concerns about loneliness and isolation it's interesting and encouraging that people seem to be rediscovering a deep-seated potential to connect with one another through song. The bond between science and music is nowhere more evident than in the number of scientists who've played or composed music, and musicians who've been inspired by science. Einstein famously said: “Life without playing music is inconceivable to me. A Perfect Harmony: Music, Mathematics and Science by David Darling is out now (Oneworld Publications, £10.99).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In honor of the show's 20th anniversary, Supernatural star Jared Padalecki shared a look at two of his treasures from the show's beginnings. Previously, we were treated to an anniversary trailer and compilation video, Ackles, Padalecki, and Collins getting the word out about a worthy cause, and Kripke shared his early plans for the episodes following the pilot. Now, Padalecki has taken to social media to offer some treasured items from the early days of the show's eventual 15-season run. "Here is my script from our Pilot Table Read (yes, it's dated March 1, 2005. And, here are my "sides" from Day 1 of filming [Supernatural]… Wednesday, March 2nd, 2005…," Padalecki shared in his caption, including images of what he was sharing. Here's a look at Padalecki's post, followed by the complete text: A post shared by Jared Padalecki (@jaredpadalecki) Here is my script from our Pilot Table Read (yes, it's dated March 1, 2005. AND, here are my "sides" from Day 1 of filming #supernatural… Wednesday, March 2nd, 2005… These sat in my pocket for our entire first day of filming, while I nervously tried to do a good-enough job on a show that I was thrilled to be a part of, and with a character I already loved… Little did I know that I'd gain a family, MORE THAN ONE family, in the years to come.</p>
