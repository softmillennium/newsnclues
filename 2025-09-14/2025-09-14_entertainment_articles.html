                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zach Bryan and Gavin Adcock were involved in a heated confrontation that nearly turned physical at the Born & Raised Festival in Pryor, Oklahoma. On Saturday (Sept. 13), the two country artists were caught on camera in a verbal altercation just moments before Adcock, 26, was scheduled to perform at the event. “Hey, do you want to fight like a man? “When you get death threats from Sack Cryin before you headline in his hometown,” Adcock wrote over the short clip, using a mocking nickname for Bryan. He captioned the post, “Eat a snickers bro.” In another video posted to Facebook, Bryan is seen climbing over the barbed-wire-topped fence and lunging toward Adcock before being restrained by security. Adcock is shown walking away while escorted by a guard. Adcock faced criticism in the comments section, with one user writing, “He scaled a barbed wire fence … and you didn't do s—t and hid behind security … this lil clip ain't fooling anybody.” Adcock responded, “Had a show to play for Oklahoma. In mid-July, Adcock seemed to throw shade at Bryan over an interaction involving a 14-year-old fan who was disappointed after not receiving an autograph from the “I Remember Everything” singer. Adcock later responded on X, criticizing Bryan's handling of the situation. “It wasn't about not wanting to sign autographs after a show, it's like letting a 14-year-old kid rant, without saying, ‘get off my d—k.' “I think Zach Bryan puts on a big mask in his day-to-day life and sometimes he can't help but rip it off and show his true colors,” he said, without elaborating on what those “true colors” might be. Despite the public feud, Adcock admitted he has never met Bryan. “I wouldn't say Zach Bryan is my buddy,” he told the podcast.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One month before Charlie Kirk‘s death, Tucker Carlson released an interview with the right-wing activist where the two spoke about how economic anxiety and debt has become a major issue for young and millennial adults in America, comparing Donald Trump‘s 2016 appeal with economically disenfranchised young voters to Zohran Mamdani‘s rising popularity among young New Yorkers. Mamdani is a self-described democratic socialist, not a communist, and he has proposed five city-run grocery stores, one in each borough, to help New Yorkers afford food. “This is yet another distress signal by young people to say, ‘Hey, if you're not gonna fix our life economically, we're gonna get very radical politically,” Kirk told Carlson. This is Charlie Kirk's final interview with Tucker Carlson.He makes a point about the similarities in appeal between Donald Trump and Zohran Mamdani. Now, Tucker, 12-13 years ago, when I started Turning Point, if you would have told me that a Republican running for the presidency would be winning the youth vote in Michigan and in Arizona, I'd say, ‘No way.' He then called Mamdani “just another iteration of this, only from the left.” Kirk then pointed out that it is harder than ever for young people to buy a home, and D.C. politicians he speaks to — likely those on the right — are disconnected from this issue. “The purchasing power of every generation is getting weaker,” Kirk said. But when it comes to the economic situation many young adults face, Kirk was correct that purchasing power is decreasing while prices and interest rates are rising, making housing increasingly unaffordable, and young voters are attracted to candidates who promise to address those issues. The age — and price — at which buyers purchase their first home continues to rise. Increasingly, millennials are receiving help from family to cover those down payments. Fox Host Says to ‘Just Kill ‘Em' While Discussing Homeless People Who Decline Help Then He Smuggled $500 Million Worth of Cocaine in One Night That's leaving a lot of would-be homeowners out in the cold to face rising rents. It's no wonder that Mamdani, who has pledged to pursue a rent freeze for all stabilized tenants and to build new housing for renters while bringing down rents.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cox stressed on several Sunday morning news shows that investigators are still trying to pin down a motive, but that there was "clearly a leftist ideology." “Clearly a leftist ideology,” Cox told NBC's Meet the Press. “Friends have confirmed that there was kind of that deep, dark internet, the Reddit culture, and these other dark places of the internet where this person was going deep.” NFL Star Joe Burrow's Charity Terminates Board Member Over Charlie Kirk Comments A Republican who's called on all partisans to tone down their rhetoric following the attack, the governor added: “I really don't have a dog in this fight. If this was a radicalized MAGA person, I'd be saying that as well.” Cox stressed on several Sunday morning news shows, however, that investigators are still trying to pin down a motive for the attack on the father of two and Trump confidant, who was killed Wednesday while on one of his signature college speaking tours at Utah Valley University. The governor said the suspect's partner was transgender, which some politicians have pointed to as a sign Robinson was targeting Kirk for his anti-trans views. But authorities have not said whether it is relevant as they investigate Robinson's motive. Spencer Cox confirms that the roommate of Charlie Kirk's alleged assassin was a romantic partner transitioning from male to female but declined to speculate whether that was a factor in the shooter's motive, telling Dana Bash, “This partner has been incredibly… pic.twitter.com/xrFabx7rsO Investigators have spoken to Robinson's relatives and carried out a search warrant at his family's home in Washington, about 240 miles (390 kilometers) southwest of Utah Valley University, where the shooting took place. State records show Robinson is registered to vote but not affiliated with a political party and is listed as inactive, meaning he did not vote in the two most recent general elections. Court records show that one bullet casing had the message, “Hey, fascist! Robinson has two younger brothers, and his parents have been married for about 25 years, according to social media posts. Online activity by Robinson's mother reflects an active family that took vacations to Disneyland, Hawaii, the Caribbean and Alaska. Like many in that part of Utah, they frequently spent time outdoors — boating, fishing, riding ATVs, zip-lining and target shooting. But he attended for only one semester, according to the university. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Utah Governor Spencer Cox said that the alleged shooter in the killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk is “not cooperating” with authorities while in custody. And I think that's very important,” Cox said Sunday on ABC's This Week. Authorities arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson last week in connection with the shooting after his father confronted him with images of the alleged shooter. This looks like you,” Robinson's father asked his son, CNN reported, citing a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. Robinson, with his father's encouragement, later turned himself in to police on Thursday night. Cox said that formal charges will be filed against Robinson on Tuesday. “All we can confirm is that those conversations definitely were happening, and they did not believe it was actually him. Appearing on CNN's State of the Nation, Cox addressed questions about Robinson's roommate. “Some outlets are reporting that the suspect lived with a transgender partner. And are investigators looking at this part of his life as a possible motivation?” Dana Bash asked Cox. “I can say that he has been very cooperative,” Cox continued, possibly misgendering the roommate. “This partner has been incredibly cooperative, had no idea that this was happening and is working with investigators right now.” On NBC, Cox added that the roommate “was shocked when they found out about it.” But when Bash again brought up whether the two were romantically involved, the governor seemed to say that is not confirmed yet: “We're trying to figure it out. Cox told The Wall Street Journal earlier the shooter was “deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology.” When Martha Raddatz asked Cox specifically about that comment on Sunday, the governor said that information “has come from his acquaintances and his family members.” Spencer Cox told @MarthaRaddatz that acquittances and family members of Tyler Robinson have indicated he was “deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology,” but said more information will be included in the charging documents against him. Back on CNN, Cox — who last week after Robinson's arrest that he had been “praying” that the shooter was “somebody [who] drove from another state, somebody [who] came from another country” — said, “I really don't have a dog in this fight.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Celine Song's Materialists has crossed the $100M mark globally, with $101.3M through today. Of that, $64.8M is from the international box office. Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions boarded offshore rights on the A24 original out of the 2024 European Film Market in Berlin, and staggered overseas release from June through September this summer, cranking out strong numbers and holds along the way. 2 romance film for 2025 behind Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy. Savvy marketing and promotional activations; fun input from the cast of Dakota Johnson, Chris Evans and Pedro Pascal; and hitting a sweet spot for an underserved audience all contributed to the success of the estimated $20M budgeted film which put a twist on the genre. The importance of getting a movie in this space this to $100M+ worldwide is clear: The industry needs fresh fare that entices audiences in terms of concept, but also discourse in its wake. 'Sacrifice' Review: Romain Gavras' Entertaining Eco-Satire Has A Surprisingly Emotional Impact - Toronto Film Festival A24 Looks To Hook 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre' Film & TV Rights; JT Mollner, Roy Lee & Glen Powell Series Up First; Netflix Movie Still In Mix 3 biggest domestic opener for A24 when it bowed on June 13, and is now the indie's 7th highest grosser domestically (in Puerto Rico, it became the studio's biggest release ever) and its 3rd biggest worldwide, with Sony powering offshore. Sony has for several years found a niche in female-centric films, including post-pandemic titles like 2024's It Ends With Us, the biggest romantic drama since 2018; Anyone But You (2023), the highest grossing R-rated romantic comedy globally since 2016; and summer 2022's Where the Crawdads Sing. Materialists, which sees Johnson as Lucy, an ambitious New York City matchmaker who finds herself torn between the perfect match John (Pascal) and her imperfect ex Harry (Evans), is the latest in Sony's international success stories. Sony later added France, Brazil and Mexico in July. Notable August releases included Korea, UK, Spain and Germany with Italy rounding out the overseas footprint earlier this month. The Top 5 offshore markets through today are: Germany ($5.4M), UK ($5.2M), Mexico ($5M), Australia ($4.7M) and Spain ($4.1M). Bringing a fresh perspective to the romantic comedy/drama, the movie resonated with a new generation while also attracting older females and sparking cultural conversation about modern dating and relationships. Social video of them “kissing” went viral. Internationally, Sony capitalized on talent (over 10 hours of interviews), and partnerships with high-fashion outlets like Elle Greece and Harper's Bazaar Korea. Johnson attended the Karlovy Vary Film Festival in July (both for Materialists and Splitsville). Earlier, in May, she made her first trip to the Cannes Film Festival, already speaking to Deadline about the movie. Around the world, Sony's marketing team implemented “Global Girls' Night” and influencer screening programs, in addition to stunted screenings like “Match-making Screenings” (Taiwan), speed dating events (Sweden, Colombia, Finland) and Team Chris/Team Pedro screening battles (Brazil). There were also collaborations with influencers, targeting young females across TikTok, META and YouTube. The studio worked with 46 bespoke international influencers to create content, and amplified those spots globally in bursts. Local highlights included in Mexico with Pinky Promise TV  where creators asked passersby relationship-centric questions. Custom TikTok spots were fashioned to capitalize on cultural moments and trending topics, constantly pushing relevance. For example: “Four Fantastic Reasons to see Materialists” spots when Pascal was deep into his promotional tour for The Fantastic Four: First Steps. Netherlands further collaborated with renowned fashion designer, Claes Iversen, who designed a dress for Loiza Lamers (winner of Holland's Next Top Model), inspired by Lucy's blue dress in Materialists. Materialists is written and directed by Song. David Hinojosa, Christine Vachon, Pamela Koffler and Song served as producers, with Taylor Shung, Len Blavatnik, Danny Cohen, Timo Argillander and Andrea Scarso exec producing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The People's Choice Award from the just-wrapped 50th Toronto Film Festival has gone to Chloé Zhao's Hamnet, first runner-up is Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein and second runner-up is Rian Johnson's Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery. Also in the awards revealed Sunday, the newly created International People's Choice Award went to Park Chan-wook's No Other Choice. Voted on by audience members since 1978 and often considered a harbinger for the Best Picture Oscar, the People's Choice Award has been won by such eventual Best Picture Academy Award winners as Nomadland, Green Book, 12 Years a Slave, The King's Speech, Slumdog Millionaire, American Beauty and Chariots of Fire. Among those that went on to Best Picture nominations include last year's winner American Fiction as well as The Fabelmans, Belfast, JoJo Rabbit, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri, Room, La La Land, The Imitation Game, Silver Linings Playbook, Precious, Life Is Beautiful, Places in the Heart and The Big Chill. Last year's surprise winner, The Life of Chuck, had no North American distributor in place and was later picked up by Neon and released this summer, making it Oscar eligible this year, just as the new People's Choice winner is. So we shall see how the tradition of TIFF and Oscar hold up in this regard. Last year both the first runner-up Emilia Pérez and second runner-up Anora went on to a collective 19 Oscar nominations between them, both nominated for Best Picture, with Anora winning. Hamnet is a historical drama co-written, co-edited and directed by Zhao, based on Maggie O'Farrell's 2020 novel. Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal star in the emotionally charged drama that premiered at the Telluride Film Festival and had its international premiere at TIFF. It is considered a major Oscar contender from Focus and Amblin' Entertainment and represents Zhao's second People's Choice Award at TIFF after 2020's Nomadland, which went on to win the Best Picture Oscar. The pic is set for a limited Thanksgiving release November 27 and a wide release starting December 12. Here is the list of this year's TIFF award winners: Second runner-up: Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery, dir. First runner-up: EPiC: Elvis Presley in Concert, dir. Second runner-up: You Had to Be There: How the Toronto Godspell Ignited the Comedy Revolution…, dir. In Search of The Sky (Vimukt), dir. Honourable Mention: There Are No Words, dir.

No surprise that Hamnet took first place seeing as how it appears to be the Best Picture frontrunner at the moment with its glowing reviews (90 on Metacritic). Rather surprising, though, that Frankenstein took second given the merely ok reviews. Frankenstein has not been well received overall. Sucks that No Other Choice was stuck in a different category.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brian Kilmeade apologized for comments he made about homeless individuals during a segment on Fox & Friends last week. Kilmeade, co-host of Fox & Friends, appeared on Fox & Friends Weekend on Sunday, telling viewers, “In the morning, we were discussing the murder of Iryna Zarutska in Charlotte, North Carolina and how to stop these kinds of attacks by homeless, mentally ill assailants, including institutionalizing or jailing such people so they cannot attack again. Now during that discussion, I wrongly said they should get lethal injections. I am obviously aware that not all mentally ill, homeless people act as the perpetrator did in North Carolina, and that so many homeless people deserve our empathy and compassion.” Charlie Kirk Shooter "Person Of Interest" Now Released, FBI Director Suddenly Says; Manhunt For Killer Of Conservative Advocate Continues - Update Judge Dismisses Newsmax's "Shotgun Complaint" Against Fox News But Will Allow New Filing On Wednesday, during the discussion of the murder of Zarutska, Kilmeade was speaking with Ainsley Earhardt and Lawrence Jones. Jones, talking about the mental health crisis, said, “we should have to live in fear while they figure out what is going on right there. And it is not a money issue. They have given billions of dollars to mental health and the homeless population. A lot of them don't want to take the programs. A lot of them don't want to get the help that is necessary. You can't give them a choice. That is the way it has to be now.” It wasn't until Saturday that the comments spread across social media, perhaps because the news cycle since then has been dominated by the killing of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. The attack on Zarutska, a refugee from Ukraine, has drawn national attention, as President Donald Trump has pointed to it as an example of the leniency of judges in Democratic-controlled metro areas, given that the suspect had a prior criminal record. Decarlos Dejuan Brown Jr., 34, was arrested and faces a state first degree murder charge and a federal charge of committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the killing of Charlie Kirk sparks mass partisan fallout, it seems Chris Martin is trying to keep the peace with a message of love. “Let's raise our hands like this and send love anywhere you wanna send it in the world, and there are so many places that might need it today,” he said onstage at Wembley Stadium. You can send this to your brother or sister, you can send it to the families of people who have been going through terrible stuff.” Martin continued, “You can send it to Charlie Kirk's family, you can send it to anybody's family. Kirk, a conservative influencer and the co-founder of Turning Point USA, died at age 31 after he was shot in the neck from a nearby building during an outdoor speech on Wednesday at Utah Valley University. On Thursday, 22-year old Utah local Tyler Robinson was arrested for the shooting. Chris Martin asked fans to send love to ‘people they disagree with but send them love anyway' #coldplaywembley #coldplay While politicians and public figures on both sides of the aisle have condemned the act of political violence, many have called attention to Kirk's divisive public stances, which he advocated through his student organization Turning Point USA. President Donald Trump has since shared a statement, blaming the shooting on the “radical left,” adding: “This type of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.” “My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity, and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support, as well as those who go after our judges, law enforcement officials and everyone else who brings order to our country,” added Trump.

Charliel Kirk's assassination has brought out the best in good people but the worst in bad people, and that's been a real eye opener for everyone. I'm going to make a YouTube video, of all the deranged and cruel comments, Republicans have made when any Demoract has died, or has been physically assualted, in the last 8 years I also have the right to my opinion and boycott him. Chris encouraged his audience to send love out into the world to anywhere they want, and gave a number of suggestions of where they could choose to send their love, one of which was to Charlie Kirk's family. What about that exactly is inspiring you to boycott him? There were memorials for Charlie Kirk all over the country this past weekend because normal people who live in mainstream society have a conscience. So I don't think your boycott will matter much. The average American didn't even know who Charlie Kirk was until they saw RIP messages on Facebook. And the ones that aren't ignorant are purposefully trying to rewrite history to turn him into a martyr. Yeah, it's a good thing Republicans didn't openly celebrate the murders of Melissa Hortman and her husband. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Molly Shannon and Kumail Nanjiani also appear in the film about a high school student who hijacks his driving instructor's car in a bid to win back his college girlfriend. In introducing his new comedy just ahead of its TIFF world premiere, director Bobby Farrelly noted that Dumb and Dumber, the 1994 release that introduced him and brother Peter to jaded audiences hankering for something edgier or grosser, or, yes, dumber, was also a road movie. In Driver's Ed, an earnest but naive high school senior (Sam Nivola), worried that his college freshman girlfriend may have broken up with him, commandeers his driving instructor's canary-yellow KIA and, joined by three classmates, embarks on a three-hour excursion to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to ensure his fears are unfounded. Those expecting more of a Farrelly-style joyride will have to settle for a casual Sunday drive that cruises along pleasantly but without inspiration, following safely within the established boundaries of Thomas Moffett's formulaic script. Granted there's nothing inherently wrong with that approach and, fueled by a charismatic young cast, the vehicle reaches its intended destination with few wrong turns on the way. 'Motor City' Review: Alan Ritchson and Shailene Woodley Wade Through Cliché in Overstretched Stylistic Exercise Venue: Toronto International Film Festival (Gala Presentations)Cast: Sam Nivola, Sophie Telegadis, Mohana Krishnan, Aidan Laprete, Molly Shannon, Kumail NanjianiDirector: Bobby FarrellyScreenwriter: Thomas Moffett Nivola, who recently made an impression as Jason Issacs' and Parker Posey's sensitive youngest kid in the third season of White Lotus, is well cast as lovelorn Jeremy, a Wes Anderson-obsessed budding filmmaker who fails to see what everyone around him knows all to well — that his girlfriend, Samantha (Lilah Pate), has moved on. Opting to accompany Jeremy on his fact-finding mission are cynical Evie (Sophie Telegadis), overachieving valedictorian Apurna (Mohana Krishnan) and, most notably, the high school's permanently stoned resident drug dealer Yoshi (Aidan Laprete, handily stealing every scene with his pitch-perfect deadpan line-readings). It all culminates at a prolonged frat party that allows the characters to pair off predictably, arriving at the sort of conclusion that feels like peak John Hughes. Allowing everything to unfold at an unhurried pace, underscored by a gentle acoustic John Frizzell score, Farrelly hasn't lost the knack he shared with his brother for mining promising young talent and giving them a platform to shine. Following in the career-boosting footsteps of the likes of Jim Carrey, Ben Stiller, Cameron Diaz and Anthony Anderson, Laprete makes a lasting, tragicomic impression here, which could be a jumping-off point for his film and television future, provided he's able to sidestep inevitable typecasting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zach Bryan was a surprise guest at this weekend's Born & Raised Festival in Pryor, Oklahoma, popping up on Saturday to sing with Gabriella Rose during her afternoon set. “If they open up this fucking gate, I'll fucking kill you,” Bryan appears to say in another video posted to Instagram. Bryan's beef with Adcock began back in July, when Adcock called out the “Something in the Orange” singer-songwriter for the way Bryan responded to a teenage fan on social media who lamented waiting in vain for Bryan to sign an autograph following a performance at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. In an appearance on Rolling Stone's Nashville Now podcast, Adcock accused Bryan of pretending to be something he's not. “I think that Zach Bryan puts on a big mask in his day-to-day life and sometimes he can't help but rip it off and show his true colors,” Adcock said. “I don't know if Zach Bryan's really that great of a person.” For the past few weeks, he's been embroiled in a back-and-forth feud with cowboy singer Charley Crockett. During a concert appearance this month with Morgan Wallen, Adcock joined Wallen onstage and held up a T-shirt that appeared to feature Crockett's photo. In June, Adcock also made headlines for declaring that Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter album didn't meet his definition of country music. “That shit ain't country music,” he said onstage, going on to elaborate during his Nashville Now interview. Fox Host Says to ‘Just Kill ‘Em' While Discussing Homeless People Who Decline Help Then He Smuggled $500 Million Worth of Cocaine in One Night Bryan has also been in his share of drama, sending volleys back and forth with his ex, Brianna LaPaglia, and also squaring off with fellow Oklahoma singer-songwriter John Moreland. Bryan removed the song he and Moreland recorded together, “Memphis; the Blues,” from all streaming services after Moreland raised an eyebrow at Bryan's reported $350 million publishing deal. Sharing a screenshot of Moreland's original post, Bryan responded: “Yooo just saw this from an artist I've always respected and supported. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Foster and Pablo Schreiber also star in Potsy Ponciroli's violent crime thriller set in 1977 Detroit, which played at both the Venice and Toronto Film Festivals. But director Potsy Ponciroli's vicious revenge saga, Motor City, while impressively sustained on many levels and even fun in a mindless exploitation way, can't get around a gimmicky script by Chad St. John populated with pulp-crime stereotypes in boilerplate situations. A glowering Alan Ritchson brings gravitas by virtue of his hulking physical presence alone, but Shailene Woodley, Ben Foster and Pablo Schreiber are stuck playing characters too familiar to pack much heat. 'Adulthood' Review: Alex Winter's Dark Family Satire Is Not Exactly an Excellent Adventure But you can only get so far with one-dimensional characters. They arrest him for the major cocaine haul found in his car trunk, which, unbeknownst to Sophia, was planted there. No prizes for guessing which of the detectives on the scene is corrupt — clean-cut Kent (Ben McKenzie) in his respectable gray suit, or Savick (Pablo Schreiber) in his black leather regulation pimp-daddy trench coat. Tossed into prison on false charges, Miller's memories return to the night he met Sophia. Reynolds goads Miller by sending a photo of himself getting cozy with Sophia, and in a moment both lurid and laughable, the prisoner visualizes the two of them getting naked and going at it right outside the cell. The mayhem that follows builds via creditable fight choreography and operatic violence to Miller's inevitable faceoff with Reynolds. But first, he and his crew must get past Savick, resulting in a visceral clash on a stairwell between the crooked cop and Singh, followed by an even bloodier mano-a-mano with blades while Miller and Savick share the tight confines of an elevator. Those pulse-pounding action set-pieces have so much bone-crunching power that the showdown with Reynolds feels anticlimactic — especially because for no good reason it involves a forward time jump and some unconvincing old-guy makeup. The energy also takes a dip when Ponciroli quits with the evocative ‘70s song selections — or runs out of music-rights cash — and leans more exclusively on composer Steve Jablonsky's moody but generic synth score. While so many brawny, testosterone-fueled action thrillers fall prey to risible dialogue — which only someone like a winking Jason Statham is able to get away with — Motor City is rendered a bit silly by its silence. (At least, verbal silence; there's plenty of other noise to keep the wheels turning.) Woodley's character remains ambiguous for too long, especially when she's flouncing around like a femme fatale in sunglasses, big hair and furs the size of Alan Ritchson. By the time we're clued into where Sophia's loyalty really lies, it becomes hard to care about her outcome. Given an even sketchier character outline, Foster — who takes the gold in a movie that's the Olympics of bad wigs — just sails over the top, taking his cue from a wardrobe of regrettable ‘70s fashions, with chunky gold chains nestled in a thick carpet of chest hair. Schreiber does marginally better because his role is mostly physical, but McKenzie gets too little screen time to register. Could somebody please find a way to use this terrific actor in movies? He's helped by John Matysiak's propulsive cinematography and production design by Mayne Berke that nails the desired vibe of a dying industrial city experiencing a spread of drug deals and other crime. Ponciroli managed to freshen up classic Western archetypes in 2021's Old Henry, but his latest attempt at genre reinvention gets hobbled by a weak script and a stylistic gimmick that runs its course just as the movie should be revving up. While it's not without entertainment value, Motor City feels like it wants to be Don Siegel meets Michael Mann meets Walter Hill with a dash of John Woo, but ends up an ersatz version of all their work.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At long last, Netflix's new Witcher springs into action, replacing Henry Cavill. The new season's official description: “After the Continent-altering events of Season Three, Geralt, Yennefer (Anya Chalotra), and Ciri (Freya Allan) find themselves separated by a raging war and countless enemies. 'The Hunting Wives' Renewed for Season 2 at Netflix With Brittany Snow and Malin Akerman Miranda Cosgrove Wants to Show a New Side of Herself in 'The Wrong Paris' Netflix has previously announced the show will end with season five. “This is the beginning of a two-season journey for our family to finally reunite and be together — hopefully forever,” Hissrich says. When Cavill announced he was quitting the series, later suggesting it was over creative differences, he posted the following statement: “My journey as Geralt of Rivia has been filled with both monsters and adventures, and alas, I will be laying down my medallion and my swords for Season 4. For his part, Hemsworth has said he is “over the moon” to be stepping in as Geralt of Rivia. “Henry Cavill has been an incredible Geralt, and I'm honoured that he's handing me the reins and allowing me to take up the White Wolf's blades for the next chapter of his adventure,” Hemsworth's statement read. “Henry, I've been a fan of yours for years and was inspired by what you brought to this beloved character. In The Hollywood Reporter's cover story with Cavill from November 2021, Cavill said he planned to follow through with The Witcher series through at least seven seasons. Cavill is currently working on another sword-swinging epic, a remake of Highlander, though a recent injury has caused the production to be pushed to 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been a weird week for free speech in America, as the responses to the fatal shooting of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk on Wednesday have come in with a healthy dose of shock and awe attached. Fox News has been at the forefront of this vocal outrage, rolling out guys like Sean Hannity to cluck his tongue at Illinois governor JB Pritzker suggesting that Donald Trump's rhetoric may have contributed to an American culture of political violence. Which does make it an extra kind of shocking to run into a clip like the one circulating online today from the September 10 episode of Fox And Friends—from the morning before Kirk was shot, while on a college campus in Utah—in which host Brian Kilmeade suggests that mentally ill homeless people who are unable, or unwilling, to accept help or treatment should be given “involuntary lethal injection, or something. Just kill 'em.” Kilmeade was talking with his co-hosts Lawrence Jones and Ainsley Earhardt about the death of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska, who was fatally stabbed on a train in North Carolina on August 22, with the main suspect in the case being a homeless man with a history of violent offenses. Jones was already going for a pretty hardline stance in his lead-up to Kilmeade's comment, suggesting that the “billions” spent on their care is wasted on those who won't accept it, and that they should either accept treatment or be thrown in jail. Which is when Kilmeade interjects with the “involuntary lethal injection” suggestion, provoking a quick “Yep” from Jones, and a quick change of topic from Earhardt. It shows a lack of human compassion and it is really the worst possible time for that kind of language to be expressed.” Numerous voices, both online and from political leaders, have called for Kilmeade to face consequences for his comment; no word on what, if anything, Fox News plans to do in response.
