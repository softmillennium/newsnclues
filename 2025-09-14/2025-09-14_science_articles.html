                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fifty years ago, a routine well-digging operation on the outskirts of Xi'an, China, led to the unexpected discovery of a single clay soldier. When government authorities continued to excavate the well, they found the soldier was just one in a massive terracotta army standing guard over a vast necropolis. Half a century later, the legendary mausoleum continues to reveal its secrets, with the latest excavation uncovering a mysterious treasure that may confirm an ancient Chinese legend: A 16-ton casket filled with treasures—including armor, weapons, 6,000 bronze coins, jade, and gold and silver camels—was just unearthed from a tomb within the vast funerary complex, according to The Daily Express. This type of untouched tomb is rare; neither the coffin, nor its treasures, appear to have been plundered by grave robbers across the past two millennia. “Most ancient tombs have been robbed so we didn't have much hope for the coffin chamber,” excavation leader Jiang Wenxiao told the Express. The tomb, however, was “considerably decayed,” Wenxiao said, and the fear of further degradation finally led archaeologists to excavate and examine it more than a decade after its initial discovery in 2011. Now, the archaeologists want to determine just who is buried inside. As noted by National Geographic, Qin himself called for the construction of this mausoleum shortly after he had ascended to the throne in 246 B.C., at only 13 years old. Qin's titanic actions as emperor would ultimately merit the lavish burial place he had ordered. The Shiji, a sprawling and hugely significant work by Prefect of the Grand Scribes Sima Qian (司馬遷) that contained everything from genaological tables and biographies to the history of rituals and waterways, is a “foundational text in Chinese civilization,” according to Grant Hardy, author of Worlds of Bronze and Bamboo: Sima Qian's Conquest of History. “Sima wrote a universal history,” Hardy writes, “...and in doing so, he defined what it meant to be Chinese.” After Qin Shi Huang's death, his eldest son, Fusu, was expected to take the throne. “But Prince Gao realised that his family would be hounded as a result,” the Express summarizes, “...and confronted Hu Hai, telling him that he had let their father down by not joining him in death.” And with this recent excavation, archaeologists are wondering if the tomb they've stumbled upon ultimately contains the remains of Prince Gao. “For the first time in 2,000 years,” said Hui Ming Tak Ted, a historian of the Qin dynasty and associate professor at Oxford University, “...we have a chance to figure out if what Sima Qian wrote is correct.” Michale Natale is a News Editor for the Hearst Enthusiast Group.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tiny red objects spotted by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are offering scientists new insights into the origins of galaxies in the universe -- and may represent an entirely new class of celestial object: a black hole swallowing massive amounts of matter and spitting out light. Using the first datasets released by the telescope in 2022, an international team of scientists including Penn State researchers discovered mysterious "little red dots." Now, in a paper published on Sept. 12 in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics, the international team of astronomers and physicists, including those at Penn State, suggest that the dots may not be galaxies but an entirely new type of object: a black hole star. They said their analysis indicates that the tiny pinpoints of light may be giant spheres of hot gas that are so dense they look like the atmospheres of typical nuclear fusion-powered stars; however, instead of fusion, they are powered by supermassive black holes in their center that rapidly pull in matter, converting it into energy and giving off light. "Basically, we looked at enough red dots until we saw one that had so much atmosphere that it couldn't be explained as typical stars we'd expect from a galaxy," said Joel Leja, the Dr. Keiko Miwa Ross Mid-Career Associate Professor of Astrophysics at Penn State and co-author on the paper. Astronomers identify cold stars by their glow, which is primarily in the red optical or near-infrared spectrum, wavelengths of light that are no longer visible. At first, Leja said, he and his colleagues thought the objects were mature galaxies, which tend to get redder as the stars within them age. "The night sky of such a galaxy would be dazzlingly bright," said Bingjie Wang, now a NASA Hubble Fellow at Princeton University who worked on the paper as a postdoctoral researcher at Penn State. In July 2024, the team spotted an object with a spectrum that indicated a huge amount of mass, making it the most extreme case of such an early and large object. The object was so distant that its light took roughly 11.9 billion years to reach Earth. The spectra analysis of that light indicated it was actually a supermassive black hole, pulling in its surroundings at such a rate that it cocooned itself in a fiery ball of hydrogen gas. Black holes are at the center of most galaxies, Leja explained. In some cases, those black holes are millions or even billions of times more massive than our solar system's sun, pulling in nearby matter with such strength that it converts to energy and shines. "No one's ever really known why or where these gigantic black holes at the center of galaxies come from," said Leja, who is also affiliated with Penn State's Institute for Computational and Data Sciences. He added that JWST has already found signs of high-mass black holes in the early universe. These new black hole star objects, which are essentially turbocharged mass-builders, could help explain the early evolution of the universe -- and may be a welcome addition to current models. The team is planning future work to test this hypothesis by examining the density of gas and strength of these early black hole stars, Leja said. Of course, the mysterious "little red dots" are great distance away in both time and space -- and their small size makes it especially challenging to get a clear picture.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People with chronic insomnia may experience faster declines in memory and thinking skills as they age -- along with brain changes that can be seen on imaging scans -- than people who do not have chronic insomnia, according to a study published in the September 10, 2025, issue of Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The study found that people with chronic insomnia -- trouble sleeping at least three days a week for three months or more -- had a 40% higher risk of developing mild cognitive impairment or dementia than those without insomnia, which is the equivalent of 3.5 additional years of aging. The study does not prove that insomnia causes brain aging, it only shows an association. "Insomnia doesn't just affect how you feel the next day -- it may also impact your brain health over time," said study author Diego Z. Carvalho, MD, of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and a member of the American Academy of Neurology. "We saw faster decline in thinking skills and changes in the brain that suggest chronic insomnia could be an early warning sign or even a contributor to future cognitive problems." During the study, 14% of the people with chronic insomnia developed mild cognitive impairment or dementia, compared to 10% of those who did not have insomnia. After accounting for factors like age, high blood pressure, use of sleep medications and a diagnosis of sleep apnea, they found that people with insomnia were 40% more likely to develop mild cognitive impairment or dementia than those without insomnia. They also had faster declines on tests measuring different thinking skills. People who reported getting less sleep than usual were more likely to have lower cognitive test scores at the beginning of the study, comparable to being four years older. They also had more white matter hyperintensities and amyloid plaques. Participants who carry the APOE ε4 gene -- linked to higher Alzheimer's risk -- showed steeper declines in memory and thinking skills. "Our results suggest that insomnia may affect the brain in different ways, involving not only amyloid plaques, but also small vessels supplying blood to the brain," Carvalho said. A limitation of the study was that insomnia diagnoses came from medical records, which do not capture undiagnosed cases or reflect how severe symptoms are.
