                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Research conducted on mice has identified that the rapid response of a specific type of defense cell is essential for controlling Oropouche virus infections and preventing serious neurological damage. Without treatment, "Oropouche fever" causes symptoms including headaches, muscle and joint pain, skin rashes, and vomiting. In severe cases, it can lead to meningitis and encephalitis. Pregnant women are at risk of complications, including miscarriage. These findings will contribute to future studies on developing therapies and vaccines against the disease. Between January and early June of this year, Brazil recorded a more than 60% increase in cases compared to the same period in 2024 – approximately 11,500 confirmed cases (compared to 7,200 last year) and four deaths. This total in just under six months is close to the number of cases recorded during the whole of last year – 13,800 according to the Brazilian Ministry of Health. This early production of antibodies depends on a protein, MyD88, which activates the response, helping to neutralize Oropouche. This study yielded a very important result, advancing our understanding of how this virus acts in two ways. First, from a mechanistic perspective, by analyzing the marginal zone B lymphocyte pathway, which has been little explored in relation to arthropod-borne viral infections. The second point is related to the possibility of therapy and vaccines, showing that antibodies act quickly. This suggests that the therapeutic window may not be so long, requiring rapid action in the early stages of infection." LEVE is supported by FAPESP, which also funded the research through three other projects (16/00194-8, 17/11931-6, and 14/50938-8). "We've managed to shed light on a virus that's still little known to the general public. By studying it, it's possible to predict processes that may be triggered in the body, and as a result, science can prepare to face epidemics." Earlier this year, another study published in the journal Infectious Diseases – also involving scientists from LEVE – showed that Oropouche fever, documented in South America since the 1950s, experienced an explosion of cases between November 2023 and June 2024 in four countries: Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru. Following the increase in cases, the Ministry of Health updated the rules for surveillance and control of the Oropouche virus in Brazil, which is now subject to mandatory reporting – that is, all suspected or confirmed cases must be reported within 24 hours. The work was carried out by a group of 30 researchers from various institutions. This shows the importance of investing in science and in training new scientists," Teixeira points out. The group conducted immunophenotyping experiments, passive serum transfers, and adoptive cell transfers to determine how early antibody and B cell responses control viral replication and spread to the central nervous system after infection. The mice produced specific antibodies against OROV within six days of infection. Discover how real-time Raman monitoring enhances API control and quality during hot melt extrusion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Physical sports have long been known to help with anxiety and mental health. Researchers at Michigan State University's Department of Kinesiology say yes. Assistant professors Sanghoon Kim and Sangchul Park, at MSU's College of Education, led a study to explore layered questions on the psychological benefits of using augmented/virtual reality, or AR/VR, technology. Published in the International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, the study shows that playing AR/VR sports games can promote psychological well-being by helping players feel connected to others and engage in real-time communication. More interestingly, the positive effects of feeling socially present were even stronger for those experiencing loneliness. Even in gaming, it's shaped not only by what people experience in virtual environments, but also by how those experiences connect with their real-life relationships and social ties." Sanghoon Kim and Sangchul Park, lead authors on the study The study analyzed results from a survey of 345 individuals who played various AR/VR sports games, such as table tennis, bowling or billiards. The recruited participants voluntarily completed a questionnaire to assess their game involvement, psychological well-being, loneliness and other factors. "The importance of these findings is to show that well-being is a complex and multidimensional construct that can be more fully understood when both individuals' sources of enjoyment - for example, games - and their social experiences - for example, loneliness - are considered simultaneously," Kim and Park said. Researchers found that those who were more engaged in gaming showed higher levels of psychological well-being. This finding provides valuable insights into the ongoing debate on the advantages and disadvantages of gaming involvement, adding new perspectives from AR/VR gaming.They also found that AR/VR sports games can create a strong sense of being with others by using avatars, real-time communication and nonverbal cues. "When people feel present with others through avatars or virtual interaction, the experience becomes more than just a game," said Kim. "The findings also expand traditional ideas about online interaction, showing that AR/VR gaming goes beyond text to include richer, more human-like ways of connecting.Users who gamed more often and who experienced loneliness in their daily lives were more likely to experience a positive psychological benefit. The authors speculated that AR/VR sports games might be offered into therapeutic interventions for those experiencing loneliness or mental health challenges. Still, the researchers say AR/VR sports games are not a catch-all solution for resolving loneliness. Some users, they found, may still feel uneasy about communicating and interacting in virtual settings, making it harder for them to develop a sense of belonging through gaming.It's one of the reasons the researchers encourage practitioners and policymakers to also consider regulating how AR/VR sports games are used to support mental health and engagement. "The study revealed not all individuals benefit from social AR/VR sport gaming," according to the study, which was co-authored with Jun-Phil Uhm at Inha University and Sungsook Ahn at Cheongju University.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When it comes to human biology, it also takes an abnormal individual to sense far beyond its surroundings, in this case, a cancer cell. Now, researchers also know that normal cells can pull a similar trick by working together. Research published in the journal PNAS from engineers at Washington University in St. Louis offers a clearer picture of how cells can sense beyond their direct environment. The research can help further the understanding of how cancer moves and point to potential targets to stop that migration. Amit Pathak, a professor of mechanical engineering and materials science at the McKelvey School of Engineering, explained that "depth mechano-sensing" is how cells sense beyond what they are attached to. In previous research, he and colleagues discovered that abnormal cells with a "high front-rear polarity" (indicative of migrating cells) can sense the farthest depth, up to 10 microns beyond their adhered environment. "Because it's a collective of cells, they are generating higher forces," said Pathak, who authored the research along with PhD student Hongsheng Yu. According to their models, this occurs in two distinct phases of cell clustering and migration. What those clustering cells "feel" will impact migration and dispersal. The extra sensing power of cancer cells means that they can get out of the tumor environment and evade detection, migrating freely thanks to their enhanced sense of what's ahead, even in a soft environment. Researchers' next step will be understanding how that works, and if certain regulators allow for the range. Those regulators could be potential targets for cancer therapy. Emergent depth-mechanosensing of epithelial collectives regulates cell clustering and dispersal on layered matrices.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Interventions to address firearm accessibility and related dangers should account not only for direct exposure to violence but also for complex psychosocial pathways through which firearms affect mental health across populations, according to a systematic scoping review published in the September/October issue of Harvard Review of Psychiatry, part of the Lippincott portfolio from Wolters Kluwer. They conclude, "A whole-government approach that prioritizes mental health screenings, firearm safety, evidence-based policies, and socioeconomic equity could significantly reduce the prevalence of firearm-related psychological harm." The researchers conducted a systematic literature search of multiple databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycInfo, from inception to March 1, 2023. Any study related to firearms that had mental health outcomes was eligible for consideration. In a scoping review, the researchers then explored relationships among firearm access, aggressive behavior, substance abuse, and societal violence, and their influences on mental health. The analysis demonstrated considerable research gaps on mental health consequences, such as posttraumatic stress disorder, sleep disturbances, intimate partner violence, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. The scoping review revealed three fundamental psychological mechanisms through which firearms affect mental health: "These interconnected mechanisms account for some of why firearms-which are deeply ingrained in society and perceived as symbols of power and freedom-have such significant consequences for mental health outcomes," the authors explain. Cultural reliance on firearms extends beyond physical danger, they emphasize. The complex psychosocial pathways that heighten risk of impulsive action simultaneously generate population-level psychological effects, which explain why multilevel interventions are necessary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PhD researchers now have the opportunity to develop their own theoretical perspective on these systems as part of an international Doctoral Network. It is coordinated by the University of Edinburgh. The new network – "Coherent Analysis Framework for Emergence in Biological Systems" or "CAFE-BIO" for short – will recruit and train fifteen PhD researchers, each gaining a distinct theoretical perspective on complex biological systems. A significant feature of the programme is that each PhD researcher will collaborate with scientists from two different academic institutions, combining previously separate techniques in innovative ways. Each institution will take a lead on different research questions inspired by biological systems. For example, one group, led by Barcelona, will develop new models to describe the full complexity of living matter, incorporating interactions that are absent in traditional condensed matter systems. A second group, led by Leiden, will develop reliable methods to determine how such interactions play out at a macroscopic level, meaning observable by the naked eye, and govern an organism's function. Thirdly, a group led by Warsaw will apply state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to aid the design of predictive models of complex biological systems. The combined effects of these endeavours will create a framework, firmly grounded in the principles of physics, that can be applied systematically to understand the many and varied forms of biological complexity. PhD researchers will benefit from training provided by several partners outside academia, including IndiScale, a spin-out company from MPI-DS in Göttingen that focuses on research data management. Göttingen and Edinburgh are the two major hubs in the new network, with five principal investigators across the Göttingen campus: Professors Stefan Klumpp and Peter Sollich (Göttingen University), together with Dr Philip Bittihn, Professor Ramin Golestanian and Dr David Zwicker (MPI-DS).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR), the largest professional organization of stem cell researchers from around the world, is concerned about a recent statement attributed to NIH that the agency will not renew research grants involving human fetal tissue (HFT), and that research with HFT is not conducted responsibly or transparently. "Research with HFT and HFT-derived cell lines has been a cornerstone of biomedical progress since the 1930s. For decades, this work has been conducted with bipartisan congressional support under both Republican and Democratic administrations in the U.S. HFT is an invaluable tool for advancing our understanding of human development, infertility, and diseases like diabetes, Zika virus, HIV, and neurodegenerative disorders. Cell lines originally derived from HFT have contributed to the development of vaccines for polio, rubella, measles, chickenpox, shingles, rabies, and COVID-19. Despite significant progress in the development of organoids and animal models, HFT continues to provide unique biological insights that cannot yet be fully replicated by alternative research methods. This framework requires thorough informed consent for tissue donation and prohibits individuals from profiting from acquiring, receiving, or transferring fetal tissue for research. These safeguards protect the rights of donors, uphold public trust, and ensure that research using HFT proceeds responsibly while continuing to deliver vital scientific advances. We urge NIH to reject political pressure to discontinue research with HFT and instead reaffirm its role as a champion of evidence-based biomedical science."
