            The Israeli military struck multiple high-rise buildings in Gaza City on Sunday, after warning people to leave several neighborhoods, in the latest round of destruction since Israel ordered a complete evacuation of the city earlier this week.
    


            Israel's assault on Gaza City appeared to be accelerating, with the military issuing evacuation orders for several towers in Gaza City within just a few hours Sunday morning.
    


            The strikes came ahead of a meeting called by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss efforts to avoid harming the hostages still held in Gaza when the Israeli military undertakes a ground operation planned to take control of Gaza City, according to a source familiar with the matter.
    


            The meeting will be attended by the Israeli foreign and defense ministers as well as the leadership of the Israeli military and security services, the source said. There are thought to be about 20 hostages still alive in the enclave, some of whom are believed to be in Gaza City.
    


            Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was in the region on Sunday, arriving in Tel Aviv in the morning, then visiting the Western Wall in the Old City of Jerusalem in the afternoon.
    


            Among the buildings struck Sunday was Al Kawthar Tower near Gaza's port. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was being used by Hamas to observe the movements of Israeli troops in the area. It said that before the strike, “steps were taken in order to mitigate harm to civilians, including advanced warnings to the population, the use of precise munitions (and) aerial surveillance.”
    


            Al Kawthar – an 11-story building – is one of several high-rises that have been destroyed or severely damaged by Israeli strikes since the IDF extended operations into Gaza City earlier this month and ordered nearly a million people in the area to head south.
    


            Hours later, after another warning was posted on X by the Israeli military, a multi-story building in Gaza City was struck but not demolished. The high-rise, known as al Mohna Tower, is in the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood.
    


            Another building at the Islamic University in Gaza was struck and destroyed by several missiles, according to images and video from the scene. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz posted a video of the strikes targeting the six-story building on X, saying: “The ‘Islamic' University in Gaza is going up in smoke. Eliminating the sources of incitement and terrorism.”
    


            At least 74 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza on Saturday, hospital officials said, with more than 50 of those killed in Gaza City.
    


            Al Shati camp in Gaza City was targeted late Saturday, as Israeli strikes intensified. Videos of the aftermath show a large fire had broken out in an area where people were sheltering.
    


Satellite images reveal wide destruction in Gaza City as Israel steps up assault



            More than 50,000 Palestinians have been left homeless after the Israeli military intensified its action in the city over the past week, the Gaza Civil Defense said in a statement on Thursday. Israeli forces have destroyed more than 130 residential buildings in the enclave's largest city over the same period, according to Civil Defense.
    


            CNN has recorded the destruction of at least a dozen high-rise buildings in central Gaza since September 5.
    


            The Palestinian health ministry said Sunday that 64,871 people had been killed in Gaza since Israeli military operations began after Hamas' attack on Israel in October 2023 – and 164,610 had been injured.
    


            Israel's escalating assault on Gaza City came as  Rubio arrived in the country for discussions about the war and the hostages. On Sunday, he visited the Western Wall in the Old City of Jerusalem with Netanyahu and US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee.
    


            Rubio is scheduled to officially meet Netanyahu on Monday. The Israeli leader is expected to raise his government's potential West Bank annexation plans with Rubio, according to three Israeli sources.
    


            Also on Monday, the leaders of several Arab and Islamic countries are expected to attend an emergency summit in Doha as a show of support to Qatar, after Israel conducted a strike on its capital city earlier this week.
    


            Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said Sunday that the Israeli strikes will “not deter” it from continuing “sincere efforts” to mediate an end to the war in Gaza.
    


            “The barbaric and demagogic practices of Israel will not deter us from continuing to make sincere efforts with Egypt and the United States to stop this unjust war,” Al Thani said.

            American sprinter Melissa Jefferson-Wooden became the world champion in the women's 100 meters on Saturday, setting a championship record time in the process.
    


            Jefferson-Wooden scorched down the track in 10.61 seconds, the fourth fastest time in history. She got out of the blocks fast and never relinquished her lead, opening up a sizeable gap over her competitors by the finish line at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo.
    


            She eventually finished 0.15 seconds ahead of Jamaica's Tina Clayton, the second-biggest winning margin in championship history, and 0.23 seconds ahead of Olympic champion Julien Alfred.
    


            “It was not easy, it looked that way, but it wasn't,” the 24-year-old told the BBC afterward. “A lot of preparation, a lot of hard work, a lot of staying grounded in who I am and trusting in my abilities, relying on my faith, my coaches, my village. At the end of the day, keeping the main thing the main thing and that is to focus on my execution.”
    


            “I felt myself get out (ahead),” she added. “Then I blacked out after that, I was just thinking ‘get to the line, get to the line, get to the line.'”
    


            “And then I crossed the line and I was trying to look at what time I ran,” she continued. “And then I finally saw my time and it hit me, ‘Oh my gosh I won, oh my gosh I ran 10.61!'”
    


            Although this was Jefferson-Wooden's first major title, she has confirmed her status as the current dominant women's sprinter at race after race, going undefeated so far this season.
    


            Now, she is turning her attention to the 200 meters as she seeks to become just the second woman in 30 years to win both events at a single world championship.
    


            “I came in as a hunter, I've never been a world champion or Olympic champion in the 100m,” she said. “There will definitely be a target on my back next year so I'll just have to learn how to maneuver through that stage as well.”
    


            Fellow American Sha'Carri Richardson, the reigning world champion, finished in fifth while two-time Olympic 100m champion and five-time world champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce finished in sixth in her last ever race before retiring.
    


            In the men's 100m final, meanwhile, Olympic champion Noah Lyles finished third, behind the Jamaican duo of Oblique Seville and Kishane Thompson, respectively.
    


            Elsewhere, Tara Davis-Woodhall won the women's long jump, adding a world title to her Olympic title. She jumped 7.13m, far further than anyone else in the field to maintain her two-year-long undefeated streak.

            Both Delta Air Lines and American Airlines say they have suspended workers for social media posts about last week's fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk.
    


            “We were made aware of Delta employees whose social media content, related to the recent murder of activist Charlie Kirk, went well beyond healthy, respectful debate,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in an internal memo shared with CNN.
    


            “These social posts stand in stark contrast to our values and our social media policy, and these employees have been suspended pending an investigation,” Bastian said in the memo.
    


            In a statement, American Airlines says some employees who posted to “promote such violence on social media were immediately removed from service.”
    


People are getting fired for allegedly celebrating Charlie Kirk's murder. It looks like a coordinated effort



            The moves are among the latest corporate blowback on workers following pressure from the Trump administration to fire those who “were caught celebrating the assassination.”
    


            “This behavior is disgusting and they should be fired,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy posted on X Saturday. “Any company responsible for the safety of the traveling public cannot tolerate that behavior.”
    


            United Airlines also sent a memo to pilots reminding them of the company's social media policy. It is not clear if United has terminated or suspended any workers. CNN has reached out to the airline for comment.
    


            “As a good rule of thumb, if something is not appropriate to be said at work, it would also not be appropriate to convey via social media when the comments can be connected to your employment at United Airlines,” the memo to pilots said.

The US is planning to press for curbs on global migration at the United Nations this month, insisting that asylum seekers should request protection in the first country they enter rather than choosing their preferred destination, according to several media reports.

The current global asylum system “has long been abused by bad actors and economic migrants to fuel the global migration crisis,” the State Department's statement cited by Bloomberg said, adding that the administration of US President Donald Trump believes that these “abuses have disrupted entire regions, enriched criminal cartels, and violated the sovereignty of nations.” 

According to Reuters, US officials have prepared an event to be held on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York later in September, which is expected to call for “commonsense and necessary reforms” to the asylum system.

Under the proposed framework, asylum seekers would be required to claim protection in the first country they reach, not a destination of their choosing, a State Department spokesperson told the Daily Caller. The official added that the administration's position is that every nation has a right to control its borders, asylum should be temporary, and host governments should decide when conditions in a person's home country are safe enough for return.

Reuters noted that the Trump administration's plan could mark a significant shift from global migration policies that have been in place since the middle of the 20th century, noting, however, that the US has no authority to unilaterally change the global framework.

Trump has made curbing migration in the US a centerpiece of his domestic and foreign policy. He has repeatedly warned against so-called migrant “caravans” from Latin America, portraying them as a threat and claiming they were full of criminals. Rights groups, however, argue that these groups consist mainly of poor people fleeing gang violence who travel together for protection.

The Trump administration has also tightened domestic asylum rules, declared a national emergency on the southern US border, increased deportations, and pressured Latin American governments to stop migrant flows.

The suspected assassin of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is refusing to cooperate with the investigation, Utah Governor Spencer Cox has told ABC. The authorities are currently gathering evidence from “people around him” and his online activities, according to the governor.

Tyler Robinson, 22, the alleged shooter, remains in custody. He is expected to face formal charges on Tuesday, Cox said. “He has not confessed… to authorities. He … is not cooperating,” the governor stated, adding that “all the people around him are cooperating.”

Cox noted that the suspect had a trans partner, confirming earlier media reports. “We can confirm that… his roommate was indeed a boyfriend who is transitioning from… male to female,” which was also verified by the FBI, he said. This person is cooperating with the authorities, according to the governor.

The investigators also established that the suspect talked to acquaintances about the shooting after the incident on Discord and claimed responsibility for it, Cox stated. “All we can confirm is that those conversations definitely were happening, and they did not believe it was actually him. It was … all joking until… he admitted that it actually was him.”

The motive of the murder remains unclear, according to ABC. Cox previously told the Wall Street Journal that Robinson was “deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology.” Asked by ABC to comment on the statement, he replied: “so far, that has come from his acquaintances and his family members.”

Kirk, 31, the founder of Turning Point USA, was fatally shot in the neck while addressing students in Orem, Utah. Robinson was arrested on Friday after his father reportedly recognized him in surveillance footage and persuaded him to surrender.

Police recovered a Mauser .30 caliber bolt-action rifle and ammunition engraved with slogans such as “Hey fascist! Catch!” near the shooting scene.

US President Donald Trump said in the wake of the incident that Kirk's murderer should face the death penalty. Cox also previously said the authorities would seek capital punishment for the assassin.

Killing the Hamas leaders in Qatar would clear the way to ending the Gaza conflict and the return of Israeli hostages, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday, just days after the Jewish state bombed the militant group's top members in Doha.

Hamas has said that its leadership was not taken out by the Israeli attack, which it described as an attempt to assassinate negotiators working on a potential settlement to the Gaza conflict.

“The Hamas terrorists chiefs” in Doha have “blocked all ceasefire attempts in order to endlessly drag out the war,” Netanyahu claimed.

“Getting rid of them would rid the main obstacle to releasing all our hostages and ending the war,” Netanyahu wrote on X on Saturday.

The Hamas terrorists chiefs living in Qatar don't care about the people in Gaza. They blocked all ceasefire attempts in order to endlessly drag out the war. Getting rid of them would rid the main obstacle to releasing all our hostages and ending the war.

Qatar has hosted several rounds of Israel-Hamas negotiations, mediating talks that led to two temporary ceasefires in the Gaza war, one in 2023 and another earlier this year. It has accused Israel of “state terrorism” after the attack on its territory.

US President Donald Trump has also condemned the strike and distanced himself from it. “I view Qatar as a strong Ally and friend of the US, and feel very badly about the location of the attack,” he said on Tuesday, adding that it was solely Netanyahu's decision.

The Trump administration's frustration with the Israeli prime minister has deepened since the attack on Qatar, Politico wrote on Thursday. “Every time they're making progress, it seems like he bombs someone,” the outlet cited a White House official as saying.

Moscow has denounced the Israeli attack as a flagrant violation of international law and an attempt to derail the settlement process. Qatar plays a “key mediating role in indirect talks between Hamas and Israel,” and striking it could only be viewed as an attempt to undermine peace efforts, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday.

VIENNA, September 14. /TASS/. The Polish Defense Ministry is not ready for consultations with their Russian colleagues over the September 10 drone incident, Russia's Permanent Representative to the Vienna-based international organization Mikhail Ulyanov wrote on Telegram.

""The Defense Ministry of Russia has proposed consultations; the Defense Ministry of Poland is not ready. This looks like a provocation or a misunderstanding, which the Polish side is not willing to clarify,"" he said.

The diplomat went on to say that ""lots of simple questions"" about why would Russia want to destabilize the situation in Poland are left unanswered.

In his opinion, claims about Russia's involvement in the incident are premature.

In the morning of September 10, the Polish army destroyed several UAVs that violated the country's airspace. According to Prime Minister Donald Tusk, 19 air violations were recorded on the night of September 9-10. NATO, at the request of Poland, invoked article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty to begin consultations among the alliance's members.

According to the Russian Defense Ministry, on the night of September 9-10, the Russian army attacked Ukrainian military enterprises in the Ivano-Frankovsk, Khmelnitsky, Zhitomir Regions, as well as in Vinnitsa and Lvov. Targets for destruction in Poland were not planned. The range of the UAVs that allegedly crossed the border with Poland does not exceed 700 km. The Russian Defense Ministry said it was ready to consult with the Polish side ""on this topic."".","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Calls rose for Brian Kilmeade to be fired after saying people facing homelessness and mental illness should be executed

Fox News host Brian Kilmeade apologized on Sunday for saying days earlier that people who are experiencing homelessness and mental illnesses should be executed – remarks that prompted calls for him to be fired.

The host said his comments on Wednesday were “extremely callous”.

Kilmeade's about-face came amid a climate in which people across the US are either being fired from or disciplined at their jobs amid a coordinated effort to clamp down on commentary that is critical about Turning Point USA's executive director, Charlie Kirk, who was shot to death at an event in Utah on Wednesday.

Mere hours before the conservative political activist was killed, while on the rightwing Fox News program Fox & Friends, Kilmeade and two other hosts were discussing the killing of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian woman who was fatally stabbed on a commuter train in North Carolina in August.

The man charged with killing Zarutska at random in Charlotte had reportedly been diagnosed with schizophrenia and had 14 prior criminal arrests. Surveillance video of the Zarutska's killing went viral online.

During the Fox and Friends appearance on Wednesday discussing Zarutska's death, co-host Lawrence Jones said unhoused people with mental illness should either accept the publicly funded programs to help in their situation or be jailed.

“Involuntary lethal injection or something,” Kilmeade responded to Jones. “Just kill 'em.”

Kilmeade faced widespread backlash for his comments. Among those to respond was California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, who on social media posted a biblical verse reading: “Whoever closes his ear to the cry of the poor will himself call out and not be answered.”

On Sunday morning, during an appearance with Jones on Fox & Friends Weekends, Kilmeade apologized for his idea of killing those who are unhoused and mentally ill.

“I wrongly said they should get lethal injections” on Wednesday, Kilmeade said. “I apologize for that extremely callous remark. I am obviously aware that not all mentally ill, homeless people act as the perpetrator did in North Carolina – and that so many homeless people deserve our empathy and compassion.”

Unlike others who were deemed to have made offensive comments about Kirk's death, Kilmeade remained employed by Fox News.

His professional fate struck a sharp contrast with Dowd, a veteran political analyst fired by MSNBC for suggesting on air that Kirk's far-right rhetoric may have contributed to the violence that killed him.

“Hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions,” Dowd said. “You can't stop with these sort of awful thats you have and then saying these awful words and then not expect awful actions to take place.”

The network and Dowd each separately issued apologies. But in a Substack article published on Friday, Dowd said he had been victimized by a “rightwing media mob” and that words he spoke before knowing Kirk had been the target of a shooting were misconstrued.

“Kilmeade is advocating for extrajudicial killings on FOX, yet Matthew Dowd was fired by MSNBC [for] pointing out Charlie Kirk's dangerous rhetoric,” author Shannon Watts said on X. “This moral asymmetry in the media and online is destroying democracy.”

Zarutska's killing has become an inflection point for Republicans, who are blaming Democratic policies in certain US cities for such crimes.

Studies show that people experiencing homelessness are more likely to be victims of violent crime than perpetrators. And other studies have shown that mental illness is not a predictor of future violence.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Spencer Cox says suspect had been ‘radicalized', and had a romantic partner transitioning from male to female

The Utah governor, Spencer Cox, on Sunday told national talkshows that the man suspected of killing Turning Point USA executive director Charlie Kirk was living with and in a relationship with a person “transitioning from male to female” as investigators continue exploring a possible motive in the attack.

The Republican politician's comments came four days after Kirk – a critic of gay and transgender rights – was shot to death from a distance with a rifle during an event at Utah Valley University while speaking with a student about mass shootings in the US and trans people. Nonetheless, Cox stopped short of saying that officials had determined the suspect's partner's alleged status was a factor in Kirk's killing.

In comments to NBC's Meet the Press, Cox said that Kirk's accused killer, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, was not cooperating with authorities. Yet authorities are gathering information from family members and people around him, Cox said.

Cox said that what investigators had gathered showed Robinson “does come from a conservative family – but his ideology was very different than his family”.

Citing the content of investigators' interviews with people close to Robinson, Cox said “we do know that the [suspect's] roommate … is a [partner] who is transitioning from male to female.

“I will say that that person has been very cooperative with authorities,” Cox remarked to Meet the Press host Kristen Welker, referring to the roommate. “And … the why behind this … we're all drawing lots of conclusions on how someone like this could be radicalized. And I think that those are important questions for us to ask and important questions for us to answer.”

The governor did not elaborate on the evidence that investigators were relying on to establish Robinson's relationship to his roommate with whom he shared an apartment in Washington county, Utah, about 260 miles from where Kirk was killed.

Robinson's arrest was announced on Friday after he surrendered to authorities to end a two-day manhunt in the wake of the 31-year-old Kirk's killing.

At the time of his arrest, Robinson was a third-year student in an electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College.

Utah records show both of his parents are registered Republicans who voted in the 2024 election that gave Donald Trump, their party's leader, a second presidency. But publicly available information offers little if any insight into Robinson's personal beliefs.

Cox made it a point to tell NBC that “friends that have confirmed that there was kind of that deep, dark internet … culture and these other dark places of the internet” where Robinson “was going deep”. The governor did not elaborate – though on Saturday, citing the work of law enforcement, he told the Wall Street Journal that “it's very clear to us and to investigators that this was a person who was deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology.”

Cox also warned Meet the Press's audience of the damage that the internet and social media sites, which he said are run by “conflict entrepreneurs is doing to all of us”.

“These companies … have figured out how to hack our brains, get us addicted to outrage … and get us to hate each other,” Cox said.

On Sunday, in a separate interview, CNN's Dana Bash asked Cox to elaborate on his comments to the Journal.

“That information comes from the people around him, from his family members and his friends – that's how we got that information,” Cox told CNN. “There's so much more that we're learning, and so much more that we will learn.”

Bash also asked Cox whether the roommate's status was relevant to the investigation and a potential motive. The governor replied, “That is what we are trying to figure out right now.”

“I know everybody wants to know exactly why, and point the finger,” Cox said. “And I totally get that. I do, too.”

Yet Cox said he had not read all interview transcripts compiled by investigators, “so I just want to be careful … and so we'll have to wait and see what comes out.”

Cox said he expected the public would learn more when formal charges were filed against Robinson. The governor said he expected that to happen on Tuesday.

After Robinson's arrest, Utah officials said that inscriptions were found on bullet casings within a rifle found near the scene where Kirk was killed.

One reportedly read: “Hey fascist! Catch!” Another purportedly read, “Oh, Bella ciao” – a reference to an Italian anti-fascist resistance song. A third reportedly said: “If you read this, you are gay, LMAO.”

During his CNN appearance, Cox also said that investigators were looking into a potential note left by Robinson.

Officials at the group chat app Discord recently said that they had identified an account on the platform associated with Robinson – but found no evidence that the suspect planned the incident on the platform.

The spokesperson for Discord did say that there were “communications between the suspect's roommate and a friend after the shooting, where the roommate was recounting the contents of a note the suspect had left elsewhere”.

When asked about the note, Cox said that “those are things that are still being processed for accuracy and verification”. He suggested additional details about the note could be “included in charging documents”.

The FBI director, Kash Patel, posted a link Sunday on social media to an article that the conservative Fox News network published a day earlier that first relayed details of Robinson's alleged partner, citing senior-level agency officials. The FBI on Saturday declined to comment to the Guardian on that report and other similar ones.

In an unrelated matter from three years earlier, Kirk had attacked Cox on social media over the topic of trans women in sports and called for him to be expelled from the Republican party.

Members of both of the US's major political parties on Sunday reiterated condemnations of Kirk's killing and political violence in general.

“Every American is harmed by this – it's an attack on an individual and an attack on a country whose entire purpose, entire way of being is that we can resolve what we need to resolve through a political process,” Pete Buttigieg, a Democrat who served as the US transportation secretary during Joe Biden's presidency, said to Welker.

Republican US senator Lindsey Graham, meanwhile, told Welker: “What I'm asking everybody to do is not to resort to violence to settle your political differences.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Fear and fatigue palpable as emboldened Trump officials set sights on LA – but volunteer groups are mobilizing

A sense of apprehension hung over Los Angeles this week in the wake of a supreme court ruling that paved the way for federal agents to conduct warrantless raids and target people based on their skin color, accent or job.

Immigrant communities have been on edge for months amid sweeping raids that have rounded up thousands of people. In July, a judge issued a temporary restraining order that barred agents from racially profiling people in southern and central California – slowing the raids but not stopping them.

Then on Monday, the supreme court ruling tossed that order aside, setting the stage for emboldened action as the Department of Homeland Security vowed to “flood the zone in Los Angeles”.

Fear and fatigue are palpable in immigrant neighborhoods where many must choose between going to work and risking deportation, or staying home and falling behind on rent. Organizers and volunteers, meanwhile, are doubling down on efforts to keep people safe.

On Wednesday morning, two days after the supreme court ruling, Carlos Mandonado, 49, gathered with a dozen other men in the shade of a flowering tree outside a Home Depot. It's a popular spot in the largely immigrant Westlake neighborhood for day laborers to find construction work. But it's also the target of raids.

Mandonado, who is from Guatemala and is undocumented, stood in an open area where he had options to escape. “I'm always alert. I have eyes in the front and back of my head,” he said in Spanish. Suddenly, a yellow Penske truck rolled into the parking lot, sending a chill through the group. Several men backed away, laughing nervously. But Mandonado recognized the driver. It wasn't la migra – this time.

In August, Mandonado narrowly escaped when Border Patrol agents used a similar Penske truck as a trojan horse to draw in day laborers looking for work. Agents burst out of the truck and chased them, arresting 16. Mandonado managed to walk away; running would only attract their attention.

Mandonado said immigration agents are supposed to follow the law, but instead they target people based on skin color. “They're being racist,” he said.

Immigrant workers like him are bracing for a new wave of raids. But the threat feels different this time. The green light from the highest court comes as immigrants face mounting economic pressure to return to workplaces targeted by Ice.

A report released this month by the Rent Brigade surveyed immigrants in Los Angeles and found that their earnings had dropped by 62% as they stayed home to avoid the raids. They fell behind on rent, placing them at risk of eviction. As a result, the report found 71% of immigrant renters have since returned to work out of fear of eviction – despite the risk of deportation.

Bills, rent, car payments and groceries mean Mandonado and other day laborers can't simply stay home. “They're scared that their landlords are going to kick them out if they don't pay their rent,” Mandonado said.

Mandonado has lived in the US for more than 30 years. If he is detained or deported, he would be separated from his mom and his three adult children who also live in the US.

Day laborers are aware of the risk. “We must have courage,” he said.

On the sidewalk near the Westlake Home Depot, two volunteers set up a sunshade and table. They are with the Los Angeles Community Self-Defense Coalition, which has deployed volunteers to vulnerable workplaces since mid-June. Jocelyn Hernandez, a regular volunteer, watched for Ice activity and handed out flyers explaining rental protections and how to identify Ice vehicles.

“I grew up in this area,” she said. “Seeing my community being ripped apart, that was my motivation for being one of the founding members of this space.”

She opposes the raids, especially in a community that is largely from Central America, where a history of US intervention fueled violence that forced people to flee their countries. Her parents are from Mexico and El Salvador. “The reason we immigrated here is because of a civil war that was founded by the United States,” Hernandez said.

“We do expect this to get significantly worse,” she said in response to the court ruling.

On Tuesday, 800 people including Hernandez joined an emergency virtual meeting hosted by the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON). Jose Madera, director of the Pasadena Community Job Center, which connects day laborers with work, opened the meeting with a breathing exercise to calm anyone who felt anxious.

After the meeting, Madera explained over the phone that day laborers had hoped the courts would uphold their constitutional rights so they could safely return to work, school and church. “The sad reality that we're living in is that the legal system is failing all of us,” he said.

Organizers are asking volunteers to “adopt” public spaces where immigrants work. Their presence can act as a deterrent against raids. They can also gather video evidence of unlawful acts that can be used in court, and help to shift public opinion. “Even though all these levels of government are failing us, we can't fail each other,” Madera said.

Madera believes Los Angeles is setting the tone for other cities, like Chicago, now under attack from the Trump administration. “That's something that Los Angeles is very proud of – that we're showing other cities how to protect themselves.”

Helping the city protect itself is also top of mind for Ron Gochez, founder of Union del Barrio's LA chapter that sends trained volunteers to patrol neighborhoods looking out for Ice.

On Tuesday, Gochez hosted a community training to teach volunteers to document Ice activity. After a lull in raids thanks to the July court order, he fears another wave will push immigrant communities into an even more precarious position.

“We feel that [the raids] are going to potentially put a lot of people out on the street,” Gochez said. “People are jeopardizing their freedom by going to work knowing that any single minute they can be abducted.”

Immigrants across the city have been calling Union del Barrio to ask for help with grocery deliveries or going to hospital, he said. The group received a call from a day laborer who needed work because he was months behind on his rent, but was too afraid to go to Home Depot. The group passed his name along to a job center. “But he's just one of literally thousands of people in the same position,” Gochez said.

Back at the Home Depot in Westlake, Mandonado said he plans to return to Guatemala after his 72-year-old mother recovers from eye surgery. He hopes that his adult children, who are citizens, can help him return to the US through legal immigration pathways. He said he owns a piece of land back home with a waterfall and fruit trees. He imagined sitting by the waterfall with a cup of coffee while talking to the plants.

He wants to return home freely, at a time that he chooses, not through the harsh system of detention and deportation. “I wouldn't want to leave like that,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

10:58 JST, September 14, 2025

TOKYO, Sept 14 (Reuters) – Kenya's Peres Jepchirchir edged Ethiopia's Tigst Assefa in a thrilling sprint finish at Tokyo's National Stadium to win the women's marathon at the world championships on Sunday, adding the world title to the Olympic crown she won in Sapporo in 2021.

The 31-year-old broke the tape at two hours, 24 minutes and 43 seconds, just two seconds ahead of Paris silver medallist Assefa.

In the wide-open battle for bronze, a surprised Julia Paternain triumphed to give Uruguay its first-ever medal at the worlds, clocking 2:27.23 in her first world championships.

For more than two-thirds of the race, Jepchirchir and Assefa were content to hang back as American Susanna Sullivan charged ahead solo looking dominant and in control.

The tables suddenly turned around 90 minutes in, when Assefa and Jepchirchir pulled ahead to take the lead and stay there side by side for the rest of the course.

It was Assefa, who won the London marathon in April, who looked the more comfortable as the Kenyan appeared to struggle in the stifling Tokyo heat.

Still, Jepchirchir managed to match her rival stride for stride for the remainder of the race, finding one last kick as the pair ran around the National Stadium track to surge ahead and claim her first world title.

“I am so happy with what I have done in Tokyo,” Jepchirchir said. “It was so hot, so difficult… When I entered the stadium, I got a lot of energy from the fans.

“I really did not expect to win. It was not my ultimate plan to sprint in the final metres, but when I saw I was 100m from the finish, I just started to kick.”

Ukrainian forces have regained control of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast village of Filia, briefly occupied by Russian troops during their incursion into the region, Dnipro Operational Strategic Group Spokesperson Oleksii Bielskyi said on Sept. 13. 

As part of its summer offensive, Russia has been attempting to break into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a previously unoccupied region of Ukraine. In late August, battlefield monitors reported that Russian forces had seized villages in the region for the first time, though Ukraine denied the reports. 

Units of Ukraine's 425th Skelya Regiment restored Ukrainian control over Filia, Bielskyi said during a television broadcast Sept. 13. 

""Good news today… Filiia in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast has been liberated from the enemy,"" he said.

""The occupiers had planted their rag of a flag. Two units from the 425th Skelya Regiment struck swiftly, throwing grenades, firing on the enemy, capturing prisoners and bringing in reinforcements to hold the ground. This is very good news. Filiia is ours once again.""

The 425th Regiment also released a video detailing the operation. 

Russia claimed to have captured Filia on Aug. 24, Ukraine's Independence Day. At the time, Kyiv did not comment on the claims. 

The battlefield monitoring site DeepState has also consistently marked Filia as under Ukrainian control. It is unclear when Russian troops occupied the village. 

Russian forces have previously attempted to enter the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast village of Dachne on several occasions, but the Ukrainian military maintains they were repelled.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian state media in June that Russian forces were conducting operations in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast as part of efforts to create a so-called ""buffer zone"" on Ukrainian territory.

Dnipropetrovsk Oblast suffers daily Russian aerial and artillery attacks and borders Donetsk Oblast, a focal point of Russia's invasion since 2014 and a major battleground since the full-scale invasion in 2022.

Since the start of Russia's all-out war in February 2022, Estonia has provided over 500 million euros ($527 million) in military aid to Ukraine, amounting to 1.4% of the country's GDP.

The General Staff confirmed to Suspilne that train traffic was suspended following the detonation of munitions on a train carrying military supplies. The cause of the explosion will be established through an investigation.

The Metafrax Chemicals plant in Gubakha, Perm Krai, is subject to international sanctions by the U.K. and Ukraine. 



 In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur breaks down Russia's largest drone and missile attack on Ukraine, as well as the shocking incursion of Russian drones into Poland, which marked the first direct NATO engagement with Moscow since the full-scale invasion began.

""These railway lines are critical supply routes for Russian forces operating in the Kharkiv and Sumy directions,"" a source in Ukraine's military intelligence told the Kyiv Independent. 



The drone crossed into Romania on Sept. 13 during a Russian attack on Ukraine, penetrating about 10 kilometers (six miles) and remaining in NATO airspace for around 50 minutes, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

The Kirishi refinery is one of the largest in Russia and has a processing capacity of over 17 million tons of oil per year. A fire broke out at the facility during a Ukrainian drone attack, Leningrad Oblast Governor Alexander Drozdenko claimed. 

Ukrainian forces downed 52 out of the 58 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Russia also launched an Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missile.

According to the statement, the communications center, responsible for coordinating operations of Russia's Black Sea Fleet units, was located at the site of the 184th Research and Testing Facility.

The number includes 880 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

Ukraine has become the world leader in drone technology, surpassing the United States, U.S. Envoy Keith Kellogg said at the Yalta European Strategy conference in Kyiv on Sept. 13. 

Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump's Special Envoy for Ukraine, arrived in Kyiv for an official visit on Sept. 11. 

""Ukraine seems now to be a world leader in defense technology. It's, in itself, a pretty good argument for making it a member of the European Union,"" he said.

Drone technology has changed the nature of warfare, Kellogg said. Comparing Ukraine's advancements in drone development to the U.S., he said the U.S. is ""well behind."" 

""I think we in the United States are behind ... I think a lot of nations are behind, and I think to the credit of the Ukrainians, they picked up on that, and they're the world leaders in it. We are fast running out of time.""

Kellogg also said it was important for the U.S. to partner with Ukraine on exchanging drone technology. 

Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, Kyiv has expanded drone production across all domains — air, land, and sea — with plans to manufacture 30,000 long-range drones in 2025.

In July, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that he'd reached a deal with Trump on the sale of Ukrainian drones to the U.S. Zelensky estimated the potential contract would be worth $10 billion and $30 billion.

Ukraine also signed a major deal with U.S. company Swift Beat to co-produce hundreds of thousands of drones this year.

Kellogg also remarked on the progress of Russia's full-scale invasion, saying Moscow's modest territorial gains in eastern Ukraine were a far cry from battlefield victory. 

""Russia is, in fact, losing this war,"" he said. 

""Now, they may make movements and say, well, they're advancing in the Donbas region and Donetsk. But if you consider advancing moving by meters, not miles, well then, okay, that's successful. But the cost they're having, it's enormous. And I don't think people truly appreciate it."" 

Russia is overly reliant on support from China, Kellogg said, describing Russia as the ""junior partner in their alliance.

""I think that if China cut off their support for Russia today, the war would be over tomorrow,"" he said. 

Kellogg previously visited Kyiv on Aug. 24 on the occasion of Ukraine's 34th Independence Day. The retired general is one of Trump's top aides in the effort to negotiate a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine and has been in close contact with top Ukrainian officials.

Speaking at the YES conference a day earlier, Zelensky credited Kellogg with helping to shield Kyiv from Russian aerial attacks. 

""Every time you are here, General, we can sleep a little more. We would like you to travel to all Ukrainian cities,"" Zelensky said.

Editor's Note: The story was update to include details from a military intelligence source. 

A Ukrainian drone struck the Metafrax Chemicals plant in Russia's Perm Krai the evening of Sept. 13, a source in Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent on Sept. 14.

Perm Krai lies over 1,800 kilometers (1,118 miles) from the Russian-Ukrainian border. 

At around 9:20 p.m. local time on Sept. 13, Perm Krai Governor Dmitry Makhonin reported that a Ukrainian drone had hit an industrial enterprise in the city of Gubakha. He did not disclose details about the enterprise. 

 ""According to preliminary information, equipment for urea production has been damaged,"" the source claimed.

Although urea is primarily used in agriculture, it can also serve as a component in the production of explosives.

Russian opposition news channel Astra identified the target as the Metafrax Chemicals plant, a major complex located in Gubakha. 

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims at the time of publication. 

In 2023, the Metafrax Chemicals plant in Gubakha launched a new Ammonia-Urea-Melamine (AUM) production facility that reportedly produced 300,000 tons of ammonia in its first eight months. The company has been sanctioned by the U.K. and Ukraine.

Ukraine regularly launches long-range drone attacks on industrial and military targets in Russian territory. Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) carried out a drone strike on Sept. 12 on a major oil refinery in Russia's Bashkortostan Republic, 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) from the border, according to intelligence sources.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theglobeandmail.com","In Portland, fears grow that Trump's crackdown is coming and will make life worse","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-portland-trump-crackdown-national-guard/","Sun, 14 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Influential figures are calling for a renewed federal presence in the city, whose long history of energetic protest once it earned the nickname 'Little Beirut.'Leah Nash/The Globe and Mail

Ben Edtl still can't quite shake a feeling of sadness when he stands at the corner of Burnside and Trinity in Portland's historic Alphabet District. 

On one side, plywood covers the windows of what was a Chipotle restaurant, now shuttered. On the other, a large window opens onto the tables and chairs of a café Mr. Edtl once ran, until “we left it and abandoned it,” he said. 

He ran several coffee shops and a roastery in Portland, a business that did not survive the turmoil of 2020 and 2021, when many months of protest – sometimes peaceful, sometimes destructively violent – raged through the Oregon city gripped by COVID lockdowns. 

What Donald Trump's crackdown looks like from the streets of Washington

Recovery has been slow. Nearly a half-decade later, a city survey found only one in five residents feels safe downtown at night. Transit ridership remains down by a third. Portland leads the United States in commercial vacancies.

Into the urban voids have come a swell of homelessness and the detritus of fentanyl addiction, a tableau of human suffering as the city sets records for numbers of people dying on the streets. 

Last year, voters replaced Portland's mayor with a new leader who entered office determined to end homelessness on streets in the city, while the state abandoned its decriminalization of narcotics.Leah Nash/The Globe and Mail

And protests have once again broken out, with clusters of people nearing 100 days of loud demonstration outside a local Immigration and Customs Enforcement building.

In Portland, says Mr. Edtl, a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump, “the energy is dark.”

To make change, “you can do it politically, or you can get kinetic,” he adds. “And when Trump brings the National Guard in, it's kinetic.”

Opinion: Trump is turning the National Guard into his personal police force

Mr. Trump has suggested he intends to move in that direction. “It's like living in hell,” he said of Portland earlier this month, promising: “We'll be able to stop that very easily.”

The U.S. President has already deployed federal troops to Los Angeles, Washington and Chicago.

But even Mr. Edtl is skeptical that doing the same will help Portland. Instead, he fears it may accomplish the opposite, at a time when, he says, “things are changing in Oregon.”

Mike Schmidt was the local county district attorney whom Mr. Trump attacked as a 'radical left' figure in 2020. He is now the general counsel of the Urban League of Portland, one of Oregon's largest and oldest civil rights organizations.Leah Nash/The Globe and Mail

Mr. Trump has for years found Portland an irresistible foil, a place that has exemplified leftist politics where he can stage his law-and-order approach.

In the violence of 2020, Portland was singled out “as some sort of archetype of a failed progressive city,” says Mike Schmidt, the local county district attorney in 2020 whom Mr. Trump attacked as a “radical left” figure. That June, Mr. Trump dispatched federal forces to the city.

“We were the pilot of this strategy,” Mr. Schmidt says. “We've been here before. We're doing it all over again.”

But it's a very different time. Last year, voters booted Mr. Schmidt from office, voting in a more centrist district attorney. They replaced Portland's mayor with a new leader who entered office determined to end homelessness on streets in the city. The state, meanwhile, abandoned its decriminalization of narcotics, a policy that had made it a progressive pioneer.

Opinion: Donald Trump is on the brink of becoming a dictator. Can he be stopped?

“Our policies in Portland have been somewhat misguided,” says David Dickson, a former community college leader who is now working to find solutions to homelessness. 

“What we were calling compassion has been really more permissiveness,” he says. A life-long Democrat, he would welcome greater federal help for the city – so long as it doesn't come in military uniform.

“Would there be any benefit to that? No,” he says.

Indeed, memories remain fresh of the tear gas-soaked months of protest in 2020 that left stretches of downtown boarded up. “We can't have that again,” says LaJune Thorson, president of the Downtown Neighborhood Association. “If it got as bad as it did before, it would be hard to survive.”

Todd Zarnitz leads the neighbourhood association in the city's northwest district, where two shelters housing more than 200 people are in the works. He says that neighbors are fed up and an overnight shelter is not the solution. 'What is the level of acceptable behaviour in a city?'Leah Nash/The Globe and Mail

But influential figures are calling for a renewed federal presence in the city, whose long history of energetic protest once it earned the nickname “Little Beirut.”

Late last month, U.S. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, who is from Oregon, told Mr. Trump: “I hope you will come to Portland, Oregon, and crack down.”

That idea is “very dangerous,” says Todd Zarnitz, who leads the neighbourhood association in the city's northwest district.

He has few compliments for the left-leaning policies and philosophies that have held sway in a city that, he argues, has learned too few lessons from recent upheaval. “The problem is so deep and wide,” he says. Parallel arcs of homelessness and violent protest have left Portland “a complete mess.”

But, he warns, any action by Mr. Trump will amount to “trying to prove a point that we're a bunch of crazy, loonie, violent, leftist liberals that are unhinged and will gladly smash up the whole town,” he said. 

“And that's right. That's what will happen.”

It's not even clear what could be accomplished by a hard-line response, argues Mr. Schmidt, who is now general counsel for the Urban League of Portland. Portland has neither enough public defenders nor enough jail space to accommodate a wave of arrests.

Besides, he said, violent crime is – like elsewhere in the country – already in decline.

Bringing in an outside force could also dim what has been, for some, a growing optimism that Portland has begun to turn the corner on a rough decade. 

Last week, Mayor Keith Wilson sent residents an e-mail warning about the possibility of “mass arrests by masked agents,” and soliciting civic volunteerism to “prove the administration's heavy-handed tactics are not needed in our city.”

Within days, the mayor's office had received more than 150 responses, including from Megan Boutwell, a local executive who figured her experience could be helpful to people in need of employment coaching.

Ms. Boutwell has felt a swell of optimism for Portland, motivated in part by Mr. Wilson's determination to end homelessness, but also by changes she has seen, like Monday night tango dancing at a local park this summer.

A federal troop deployment, she worries, “would be a huge step backwards.”

“It takes people loving the place they live to make it better,” she says. “And that's what I want to be a part of.”

Romania said NATO fighter jets were scrambled Saturday night after a Russian attack drone entered the country's airspace, hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia was testing the alliance. 

Romanian Defence Minister Ionut Mosteanu said a single Russian drone flew low over the country's territory, and that two Romanian F-16s and two German Eurofighters had been close to opening fire when the drone disappeared from radar, likely turning back into Ukraine. Residents of the southeastern county of Tulcea near the Ukrainian border were warned to take cover during the incident.

Mr. Zelensky – who has expressed exasperation over NATO's reluctance to aid Ukrainian air defences by shooting down Russian drones that cross into their territory – wrote on social media that the drone had gone 10 kilometres deep into Romanian airspace, and operated there for 50 minutes. 

Poland also closed the airport in its eastern city of Lublin on Saturday in response to Russian drones flying over the adjacent regions of Ukraine.

The drone that crossed into Romania was one of 58 that were launched at Ukrainian cities Saturday night, nearly all of which were shot down.

The intrusion into Romanian airspace came the same week that an unprecedented 19 Russian drones flew into Poland, forcing Polish and Dutch fighter jets to shoot several down in the first-ever instance of NATO armies firing directly at Russian military hardware. 

In the aftermath, Poland invoked Article 4 of the NATO treaty, which calls for consultations whenever the territory of member state is threatened.

What is Article 4, the treaty provision invoked by Poland after Russian drone incursions?

On Friday, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte announced the start of a new military operation, Eastern Sentry, that will see additional fighter jets and air-defense systems deployed alliance's eastern frontier in Poland and the Baltic States. 

But remarks by U.S. President Donald Trump – who suggested the Russian incursion “could have been a mistake” – have underscored divisions within the alliance.

In a separate social media posting on Saturday, Mr. Trump said he was willing to introduce “major” new sanctions on Russia, but only once NATO countries ended their purchases of Russian oil.

He also called for NATO to collectively slap 50 to 100-per-cent tariffs on China, which has increased its trade with Russia to record levels since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, until the war is over. 

But Mr. Trump seemed more impatient with his country's allies than with Moscow or Beijing. “If NATO does as I say, the WAR will end quickly, and all of those lives will be saved! If not, you are just wasting my time, and the time, energy, and money of the United States,” he wrote, referring to the war in Ukraine, which Mr. Trump has made sputtering efforts to try to resolve.

Tusk described Russia's action as 'a large-scale provocation,' carried out during a wave of Russian strikes on Ukraine. The drones were shot down over Poland's territory with help from NATO allies.

Mr. Zelensky, whose country is not a member of NATO, and was invaded by Russia in 2022, made it clear that he was underwhelmed by NATO's reaction to the incursions. He warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin would push even further if he didn't see a stiffer response.

“NATO countries are mobilizing military aircraft – but a couple of days go by, and this ceases to be a topic of conversation. And what are the consequences for Russia? Let's be honest, none,” Mr. Zelensky told the annual Yalta European Strategy conference in Kyiv. 

“Nobody wants to expand the war. Nobody wants to talk about that… we are simply warning that a strong response is needed.”

Mr. Zelensky said he hoped the alliance would respond to the drone incursions by giving Ukraine the military and financial assistance it needs not only to shoot down Russian drones and missiles, but to strike deep into Russia at the factories where the kamikaze drones are produced.

Russia reported on Sunday that it had shot down 361 Ukrainian drones over the previous 24 hours, with an explosion and fire reported at an oil refinery in the Bashkortostan region, 1,400 kilometres from the Ukrainian border.

Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski, who also attended the YES conference, agreed the alliance needed to show its resolve, and said he hoped to see a stronger line from the United States in particular.

“We hope the United States will join other allies in solidarity,” Mr. Sikorski said. “We need to collectively show Putin that there are limits to his hybrid war, where we will stop him. Because remember, this is not an isolated incident. It's part of a pattern.”

The annual YES conference is organized by the foundation of Viktor Pinchuk, one of Ukraine's most powerful businessmen. This year's event was held under high security and extreme secrecy, with all reporting prohibited until the end of the two-day conference, when high-profile foreign guests had already departed Kyiv on Saturday.

Among the attendees was Keith Kellogg, Mr. Trump's envoy to Ukraine, who alternated between suggesting that peace was almost within reach, and referencing the negotiations in Paris that led to the end of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War – a painstaking process that took five years. 

“We thought it was going to be easier to solve than it's turned out to be,” Mr. Kellogg said of the effort to make peace in Ukraine, which last month saw Mr. Trump invite Mr. Putin to a summit meeting in Alaska.

The conference included a salute to former Canadian prime minister Jean Chrétien, who – at the age of 91 – took an overnight train ride into a war zone to attend this year's event. Mr. Chrétien addressed the first ever YES conference in 1994.

Transport Minister Chrystia Freeland, a well-known figure in Kyiv due to her Ukrainian heritage, also made the trip and moderated several panels.

“I want to congratulate the government and the people of Ukraine for the big fight they have put up,” Mr. Chrétien said in brief remarks after being introduced by Ms. Freeland. “Keep up the fight.”

Such inspirational words were undercut by the remarks of British historian Niall Ferguson, who said that many attendees seemed not to grasp that the U.S. was no longer actively supporting Ukraine. 

Mr. Ferguson told the conference that unless the European Union greatly increased its support for the war effort, he could see history repeating itself, with Russia “grinding out a victory,” while losing large numbers of people, just as it has in previous wars.

Maintaining power as you age helps support muscle and metabolic health.francescoridolfi.com/iStockPhoto / Getty Images

A while back, I thought I'd show off for my son by performing a kip-up, springing neatly to my feet from my back in one powerful motion. I hadn't attempted this in 20 years but somehow expected to pull it off. He watched as I kicked off explosively and caught about an inch of air before falling back to earth with a thud. “What was that?” he asked. Other than a near concussion?

Our sense of aging doesn't progress smoothly over time; we piece it together through moments such as these. And there is a fairly predictable list of physical changes that take place as we get older. But what goes first? Is it your metabolism? Your bone density? Your can-do attitude? 

One of the steepest drop-offs is how fast you can move something, whether it's your own body or a weighted implement. The term is muscle power (work divided by time) and it can be conspicuous in its absence. 

Is it a myth that seniors need to slow down their fitness routines?

When you look for physically fit people over 40, you'll find plenty of endurance athletes and yoga practitioners. You'll see weightlifters and rock climbers too. Most of these athletes move slowly. Deliberately. Between 0.4 and 2.5 metres a second, if you're tracking. Speed and power athletes – the kind you'd see in a decathlon event – are far rarer in that age group. This is because the fast-twitch muscle fibres responsible for generating powerful, high-velocity contractions atrophy earlier than slow-twitch fibres. 

Your muscles don't exist in isolation. If they are the hardware, your nervous system is the operating system.

“When we talk about the factors going into muscle power, we have to consider the features of the muscle tissue itself and neural input. … With aging, both of these systems are going to be deteriorating,"" says Michael Paris, a researcher at York University who studies the relationship between muscle and aging.

“Within the nervous system, the brain and spinal cord of older adults may have a reduced and more inconsistent ability to activate the muscle in a co-ordinated manner, especially during fast or forceful contractions, which again will contribute to the loss of muscle power with aging.”

But do these physical changes come because we stop moving fast? Or do we stop moving fast because of these physical changes? It's a chicken-or-the-egg kind of situation, Paris says.

To get some insight on the athletic side of things, I reached out to coach Derek Evely, whose athletes, including Canadian Olympian Dylan Armstrong, have earned more than 70 national and international medals in throwing events. His experience syncs up with Paris's research – that power decreases with age – but he's also worked with people who challenge these norms.

“Throwers probably are able to sustain performance later in terms of their age relative to the other event groups. ... They can peak in the early 30s. And so you have people that, you know, are technically masters at 35, but could still be world-class athletes.”

What makes throwers different?

Throwing sports – such as shot put and hammer throw – have the highest technical demands of all track and field activities, Evely explained. Technique takes time, and skill can be the bottleneck in expressing power, not raw horsepower. “That's why throwers can compete at a higher level so much longer than everybody else. It's really interesting. And kind of compelling.”

For aging and fitness, community is the most important part

Do you need to hurl iron spheres at 12.5 to 14.5 metres a second to age gracefully? Probably not. Aging well has more to do with functional abilities, such as getting up from the floor (albeit not with a kip-up). However, maintaining power supports muscle and metabolic health.

“Muscle power – the ability to generate force or contract in a quick and forceful manner – is really important for older adults and their ability to move around the world,” Paris says.

And there's no point where hope is truly lost, he adds. Older adults who stay in motion lose power at a slower rate than their counterparts; even 100-year-olds can improve their muscle power with dedicated exercise.

Movements that work on muscle power, like jumping, are great to incorporate into your regular exercise routine.bernardbodo/Getty Images

Jumping: Paris recommends targeting the quads and front abdominal muscles in particular. Working up to five minutes of daily jumping is one evidence-based option.

“Start easier than you think. There's no rush,” says Greg Lehman, a pain and rehab expert. Five sets of 10 jumps can work when performed near daily. “With age, the stiffness and strength of our Achilles and calves decreases. You could argue this is a pretty good intervention.”

Resistance: Lehman recommends a simple protocol of two resistance workouts a week, the first done with moderately heavy weights at a slower tempo. The second should feature the same exercises, but done with less weight and at a faster speed. Try a controlled lowering motion followed by an explosive lifting (concentric) motion.

Start slow: You should build a base of strength for six to eight weeks before adding fast movements, Lehman says. 

Paris suggests going beyond your body weight for explosive movements and adding weight, in the ballpark of 60 to 70 per cent of your one-rep max (the most weight you can move once). Training for power also means terminating the set before movement slows down – something that happens before you even register feeling tired. Specificity is key, and training for power doesn't mix well with fatigue.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","The prison economy: Behind bars, everyone's making money","https://www.dw.com/en/the-prison-economy-behind-bars-everyones-making-money/a-73832810","Sun, 14 Sep 2025 08:10:06 GMT","

The world spends hundreds of billions yearly to punish offenders, with little return beyond more crime and less hope. DW examines how private contractors, organized crime gangs and inmates exploit prison for profit.

Crime may not pay, but prison does. Behind the locked doors and razor wire, a parallel economy thrives. But who's really cashing in?

Governments worldwide spend hundreds of billions annually to keep more than 11.5 million people behind bars — mostly men. The exact global cost is unclear, but in the United States alone — the world's biggest jailer — the prison budget is $80.7 billion (€69.1 billion) per year, versus Brazil at around $4 billion. India, with the world's fourth-largest prison population, spends nearly $1 billion.

Private corporations now profit from incarceration in many countries, from building cells to selling phone calls. Inside, organized crime syndicates run contraband empires and extortion rackets. Inmates, meanwhile, hustle for survival in an underground economy where ramen noodles are currency and labor pays just a few cents per hour.

As well as low rehabilitation rates, governments are also failing to curb another growing crisis — prison overcrowding. Penal Reform International reports that 155 countries struggle with prison overcapacity, with 11 at over double their limit. Facilities in Congo, Cambodia and the Philippines are operating at 300 to 600% occupancy.

The private sector has been muscling into prison management since the 1980s, with the US, United Kingdom, Mexico and Brazil increasingly outsourcing operations and services to for-profit firms. Most European, Asian and African countries have so far resisted privatization, with some emphasizing the importance of public accountability.

The US government spends over $3.9 billion per year on private prisons, whose operators earn billions more from others services, including prisoner food, health care and telecommunications. These US prison essentials, known as commissary, are marked up by as much as 600%, while phone calls can cost families up to $16 for just 15 minutes.

While Indian prisons are entirely state-run, Brazil's pay-per-prisoner scheme is criticized as perverse, as it incentivizes private operators like Umanizzare to maximize inmate numbers rather than rehabilitate, leading to prison overcrowding and violence. 

This was seen in multiple prison riots throughout Latin America, including the 2017 riot that killed nearly 60 people at a packed prison in Manaus, the capital of Brazil's Amazonas state. The facility was costing the government double the national average price per prisoner.

Private companies also build and manage entire prison facilities, supply surveillance tech, run prison labor programs and transport inmates between jail facilities and court. They tend to strip costs right back by understaffing facilities, which reduces inmate services. The results have been mixed.

One of the private sector's major successes is a prison run by British prison operator Serco in Auckland, New Zealand, which claims that just 13.6% of inmates reoffended within two years of release, local media reported in January. This is lower than the 34% rate for government-run prisons and even surpasses Norway's recidivism rate of 20%, considered the global standard for prison performance.

""[Private firms] tend to run prisons more efficiently than the state,"" Benjamin Lessing, a political science associate professor at the University of Chicago, told DW. ""But they're not a panacea and require thorough oversight.""

While private prisons get a bad rap for profiting from punishment, state-operated prisons struggle with mismanagement, security threats and inefficiency.

One example saw a New York judge  threaten to reduce a man's sentence for tax fraud to home detention if he were to be sent to a federally-run prison in Brooklyn. The judge described the conditions inside as ""barbaric"" after several killings, stabbings and severe beatings.

Beyond bureaucracy, a darker economy thrives behind bars. Organized crime gangs have embedded themselves deep within the prison system. These groups run drug trafficking, extortion and violence both inside and beyond the gates.

Smuggling contraband like drugs, phones and weapons into prisons is a major source of income. Brazil's PCC gang, whose name translates as First Capital Command, sells drugs at 10–20 times their street value and smartphones for up to $1,500 on the inside, making millions each year. 

The gangs sometimes run the prisons better than the state. Lessing said that when the Brazilian government tried to crack down on gangs, it led to higher incarceration rates and the building of more prisons. Ironically, those new prisons also came under gang control.

""In Brazil, the gangs didn't start as mafia families or drug cartels,"" Lessing, who is the author of the upcoming book ""Leviathans: How Gangs Govern from Behind Bars,"" explained. ""They began in response to brutal conditions in prisons. Their real innovation was to impose a baseline social order — outlawing prison rape, theft, and extortion while rationalizing violence.""

Not all gangs are so honorable. In El Salvador, MS-13 runs extortion operations from inside prison, demanding monthly payments from shops, street vendors and taxi drivers, with threats of violence or death for noncompliance.

In the US, many gangs operate on racial lines. The white supremacist Aryan Brotherhood profits from drug trafficking and scams involving prison grocery supplies. These schemes often involve inflating prices, controlling inmate purchases, or laundering money through prisoners' accounts.

India's prison underworld, meanwhile, is also shaped by powerful criminal networks. In New Delhi's Tihar Jail, extortion, contract killings, and drug trafficking are rampant. In western Gujarat, Sabarmati Central Jail has become a hub for transnational criminal activity, including narcotics smuggling and money laundering.

In overcrowded cells, inmates have built an informal marketplace driven by necessity. Everyday items — instant noodles, soap, cigarettes — become currency in a system where survival often hinges on trade.

Across many prison systems, a brutal borrowing rule applies among cons: take one, repay two or sometimes three. Sometimes known as ""double bubble,"" this system is a form of high-interest credit for the basics in life and contraband, which can quickly trap inmates in cycles of debt and violent retaliation.

Inmates without family money or external funds often turn to dealing drugs to other prisoners just to pay for the essentials. They act as couriers, minders or lookouts in exchange for protection, food, or a cut of the profits. Relatives are sometimes coerced into hiding phones or drugs in body cavities during prison visits or paying off inmate debts.

In Brazil, the modal prisoner is a young, poor, nonwhite male from a favela [slum], affiliated with one of the gangs, who is put in a prison dominated by that gang, Lessing said. While inside, he may not choose to join the gang but will follow their rules and when released, he has contacts who can help him start a drug business or other criminal activity. 

""This is a key way that prisoners bring the gang's power back to the street,"" Lessing told DW.

Prison labor also helps cut operational costs, with US inmates paid as little as $1–$4 per day for kitchen work, cleaning and laundry. In Indian jails, inmates can earn as little as $0.10 per day, while Brazilian law ensures inmates receive at least 75% of the minimum wage, which is $10 per day.

US prisoners' families, meanwhile, spend $2.9 billion a year on groceries, phone calls and other expenses related to their loved ones' sentences, according to the Prison Policy Initiative. They're often called to pay court fees, restitution, or fines, too.

Rescue workers found the body of a man after searching through the rubble of the severely damaged building. The cause of the blast was a gas leak, according to reports. 

An explosion in a bar in the Spanish capital, Madrid, on Saturday killed one person and injured at least 25, authorities said.

Rescue workers found the body of a man early Sunday morning during a search by local firefighters and police, Madrid's Emergency Services said on X.

The emergency services said on Saturday night that two of the victims were in a ""serious"" condition, while three were  ""potentially serious"". 

Firefighter chief Javier Romero said four people had been pulled from the rubble alive.

Local media reported that the blast, which occurred at the ""Mis Tesoros"" bar at 3 p.m. (1300 UTC/GMT) in the Puente de Vallecas district of Madrid, was due to a gas leak.

According to the newspaper El Pais, the head of the Madrid City Council Fire Department, Carlos Marin, explained that it was a gas explosion, but that they are still unable to specify the type of gas, the cause, or exactly where it occurred.

Inmaculada Sanz, deputy mayor and delegate for security and emergencies at Madrid town hall, said that it was still ""too early to predict what the cause of the explosion could have been.""

Sanz that the residents of the nine housing units that formed part of the building ""will have to be rehoused for at least a few days.""

The building where the bar is located is ""currently unstable,"" according to Marin of the City Council Fire Department.

While some of the upper apartments were not damaged, the affected area is the entrance, which means ""access to the building is completely impossible,"" Marin said.

Charlie Kirk's alleged assassin was in a relationship with his transgender roommate, potentially shedding light on his motivation for killing Kirk if found guilty. 

Spencer Cox, the governor of Utah, said that Tyler Robinson, 22, who was arrested on suspicion of killing the conservative political activist, was living with a biological man transitioning to become a woman.

Neighbours claimed to have seen Mr Robinson holding hands with his partner, who is also reported to be from a conservative Christian family.

On Sunday, Mr Cox said: “We can confirm that his roommate was indeed a boyfriend who is transitioning from male to female.”

He added that Mr Robinson was not co-operating with authorities while in custody.

Early in the investigation, there were initial reports that the ammunition used to shoot Kirk was engraved with “transgender and anti-fascist ideology”.

But it was later confirmed that the inscriptions did not explicitly reference transgenderism and instead alluded to ironic internet culture.

No clear motive has been established in the investigation into Kirk's killing. However, his anti-trans ideology was central to his brand of Right-wing conservatism.

Kirk opposed transgender rights and Turning Point USA, an organisation he co-founded, sponsored rallies against transgender medical care. In April 2024, he likened doctors who performed gender-affirming care to Nazis committing atrocities.

At the time of his death, Kirk was answering a question about the prevalence of transgender mass shooters.

Mr Cox said the suspect had “clearly” Left-leaning political beliefs, disliked the conservative influencer and was being uncooperative in custody.

However, photos and comments posted by his family suggest Mr Robinson may have in fact had Right-wing leanings. A photo of him squatting in a tracksuit appears to be an inside joke among alt-Right followers called the “Slav squat”.

Josh Kemp, Mr Robinson's neighbour, claimed to have seen the alleged assassin walking hand-in-hand with another individual two weeks before Kirk's killing.

Speaking to The Sun, he said the pair appeared to be a couple, adding: “They drove off in his car, the Dodge Challenger.”

The neighbour claimed he also saw them kissing and heard them discussing a doctor's appointment, which he believed was related to the roommate's transition to becoming a woman.

Mr Kemp added that Mr Robinson was wearing all black and that he thought the 22-year-old was “weird”.

A family member told the FBI that Mr Robinson had grown increasingly political in recent years, accusing Kirk of “spreading hate” during a recent family dinner.

Casings from the weapon used to kill the conservative activist were found to have several anti-fascist messages engraved on them.

One engraving read “Hey fascists, catch!” next to an up arrow symbol, right arrow symbol and three down arrow symbols. Another was scrawled with lyrics referencing Bella Ciao, a Second World War Italian anti-fascist song.

Other engravings that were initially believed to refer to transgender ideology instead appeared to allude to the furry subculture, a community of individuals interested in anthropomorphic animal characters and fur suits.

One bullet casing was engraved with the words “notices, bulges, OwO, what's this?”, a meme used to symbolise flirting within the furry community, with the OwO emoticon supposedly resembling a face.

Mr Cox said: “Friends have confirmed that there was kind of that deep, dark internet, the Reddit culture, and these other dark places of the internet where this person was going deep.”

During a press conference on Friday, investigators revealed that Mr Robinson had shared messages with his roommate in which he discussed the bullet engravings, as well as plans to retrieve and stash a rifle.

In the woods near campus, officers retrieved a high-powered, bolt-action rifle containing one spent cartridge and three more, unused rounds.

The roommate was said to have helped investigators by sharing Mr Robinson's messages with them.

Donald Trump and his allies have used the killing of Kirk to rally against the rise of radical-Left violence across the US, following the assassination attempts on the president last year.

Hours after Kirk's killing, Mr Trump gave an emotional speech, claiming the “radical Left” was “directly responsible for the terrorism that we are seeing in the country today”.

Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, on Friday pledged to “dismantle” Left-wing groups accused of “fomenting violence”.

He told Fox News: “The last message that Charlie Kirk gave to me before he joined his creator in heaven was he said that we have to dismantle and take on the radical Left organisations in this country that are fomenting violence.

“That was the last message that he sent me … we are going to do that.”

            Romania has condemned Moscow's “irresponsible actions” after alleging that a Russian drone breached Romanian airspace during an attack on neighboring Ukraine, prompting Bucharest to scramble fighter jets.
    


            The Russian drone used in attacks on Ukraine entered Romanian airspace at 6.05 p.m. local time on Saturday, according to Romania's defense ministry.
    


            The incident comes days after Poland shot down Russian drones that had violated its airspace earlier this week – prompting NATO allies to pledge to beef up defenses on the alliance's eastern flank.
    


            The drone was intercepted by two F-16 fighter jets, which were carrying out an air patrol mission in northern Dobruja and, according to the ministry, came close to downing it.
    


            The drone orbited for about 50 minutes, according to a statement from the defense ministry, before leaving national airspace near the town of Pardina in northern Dobruja, heading towards Ukraine.
    


            The Russian Ministry of Defense has not commented on the claims.
    


            The F-16 fighter jets had intermittent contact with the drone – visually and by radar – the statement said. Its pilots received authorization to shoot it down but decided not to open fire after assessing the collateral risks.
    


            “The Ministry of National Defense firmly condemns the irresponsible actions of the Russian Federation and emphasizes that they represent a new challenge to regional security and stability in the Black Sea area,” the statement said.
    


            The ministry added that the incident demonstrates a “lack of respect for the norms of international law” by Russia. It also endangers the safety of Romanian citizens and the collective security of NATO, the ministry said.
    


            The Romanian foreign minister summoned the Russian ambassador to the country on Sunday, according to Defense Minister Ionut Mosteanu.
    


            Kaja Kallas, the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, condemned the violation of Romanian airspace as “yet another unacceptable breach of an EU member state's sovereignty.”
    


            “This continued reckless escalation threatens regional security,” Kallas wrote in a post on X. “We stand in solidarity with Romania. I am in close contact with the Romanian government.”
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on X Saturday: “Today, Romania scrambled combat aircraft because of a Russian drone in its airspace. According to current data, the drone penetrated about 10 kilometers (around 6 miles) into Romanian territory and operated in NATO airspace for around 50 minutes.”
    


            In light of the incident, Zelensky reiterated calls for sanctions against Russia and collective defense. “Do not wait for dozens of ‘shaheds' and ballistic missiles before finally making decisions,” he said.

            • DC reels from Kirk killing: The impact of Charlie Kirk's assassination is being felt throughout Washington, from scrutiny over President Donald Trump's rhetoric and the FBI director to renewed efforts to better protect lawmakers.
    


• Investigation updates: The roommate of Tyler Robinson, Kirk's alleged shooter, was a romantic partner of Robinson and was transitioning from male to female, the Utah governor said Sunday. Investigators are looking into whether it was a factor in the assassination, and into a note left by Robinson.
    


            • Crime crackdown: Meanwhile, Trump has pushed ahead with his federal law enforcement crackdown in Democratic-led cities, though he shifted focus last week from Chicago to Memphis in part to avoid legal headaches, sources told CNN.
    


            • Foreign policy: The president enters a key week on the global stage, with his state visit to the United Kingdom coming at a critical time for US-European relations, and as efforts stall to end wars in the Middle East and Ukraine.
    


            Tyler Robinson, the suspect in custody for the assassination of Charlie Kirk, is being held in a special housing unit at the Utah County Jail so staff can “keep a close eye on him,” the Utah County Sheriff's Office confirmed to CNN in a statement.
    


            Robinson is under enhanced supervision and will remain on special watch pending a mental health evaluation, a process that may take several days, according to Sgt. Ray Ormond.
    


            “After cleared by mental health, he will proceed through our classification process to determine the appropriate housing area,” Ormond said. “He will continue to be monitored by mental, medical, and custody staff throughout the duration of his stay.”
    


            Ormond stated the precautionary measures are standard for cases involving serious charges or potential behavioral concerns. While Ormond said he hasn't been made aware of any specific suicidal comments from Robinson, the suspect will continue to be monitored by medical, mental health and custody staff throughout his stay.
    


            Speaker Mike Johnson said he's been working to reassure House members about their personal security in the days following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
    


            “I've been talking with a lot of them over the last few days about that and trying to calm the nerves to assure them that we will make certain that everyone has a level of security that's necessary,” he said on CBS' “Face the Nation.”
    


            Johnson said leadership is looking at “all the options” to bolster member security and urged lawmakers to “turn down the rhetoric,” saying allegations that Republicans are “fascists” is “not helpful.”
    


            “There are some deranged people in society, and when they see leaders using that kind of language so often now, increasingly, it spurs them on to action,” he said, adding that he's “heartened” to see “many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are stepping up and saying that.”
    


            Johnson said he will participate in a vigil for Kirk on Sunday evening at the Kennedy Center. He also said he would lead a moment of prayer for lawmakers when the House returns on Monday evening.
    


            Republican Utah Sen. John Curtis took aim at partisan labels for the word “radical” after the shooting of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk in his home state.
    


            “I think you need to take the word radical and remove ‘right' or ‘left.' Radical coming from any direction is not good, it's not healthy and it should be called out,” Curtis said on Sunday on ABC's “This Week.”
    


            The Utah Senator honed in on social media's impact, saying there is often “zero liability for what people are putting out there.”
    


            “It (social media) can be positive, but I fear in many cases, it's a huge weight and a very negative weight on this generation.”
    


            Curtis also noted the strength of Kirk's organization Turning Point USA but said Kirk himself is “not replaceable.”
    


            “I have no doubt those shoes will be filled, never quite the same way, but they will be filled,” Curtis said, acknowledging the group's leadership vacuum in the wake of the shooting.
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Sunday that President Donald Trump is “grateful” for the cooperation of local leaders in Memphis as the administration prepares to deploy the National Guard to address violent crime in the city when Mayor Paul Young seemed to suggest otherwise.
    


            “Well, the president will be working with the local mayor and the governor in Tennessee to make sure that operations are streamlined and that we're effective, and that we're going after the worst of the worst, those criminals that are there, getting them off the streets and making it safer,” Noem said in an interview with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo.
    


            “So it's good to have local leaders that understand the importance of the work that this president is doing,” she continued.
    


            “The president is very engaged on this issue. He's grateful for the partnership of those local leaders, and we're looking forward to making a big difference there for the people that are in Tennessee.”
    


            However, Young offered a starkly different account in an interview with CNN a day earlier, saying he was blindsided by the decision and does not support the deployment.
    


            “I'm certainly not happy,” Young told CNN, referring to the deployment of federal troops. He said he only received definitive confirmation of the decision when Trump publicly discussed it on national television.
    


            On Friday, during an appearance on “Fox & Friends,” Trump said he was sending National Guard troops to Memphis to combat the city's high crime rates, calling it a “deeply troubled” place.
    


            “The deployment may go beyond the National Guard and could include the Army if needed,” Trump said.
    


            After shootings rocked the country this week, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis pushed back on Utah Gov. Spencer Cox's characterization of social media as a “cancer,” and placed the blame on the perpetrators, saying “the responsibility lies firmly with them.”
    


            “What I would focus on is condemning the act of violence. It's not the free speech that led to this. It's not the fact that people can talk and communicate online. It's the actions of an unhinged, evil individual that caused this horrible, horrific assassination,” Polis said on ABC's “This Week,” referencing the killing of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk.
    


            The Colorado governor also prayed for the recovery of two students who were injured in a shooting at Evergreen High School in the Denver area. Polis acknowledged that the shooter was radicalized by online content, but the Democratic governor did not blame the shooting on the gunman's access to media.
    


            “Many people play video games, many people are online, many people watch movies, and many of them are perfectly peaceful Americans who contribute to making our country safer and a better place,” Polis said.
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk as a defining moment not only for the United States but for the world and discussed one of their final exchanges about violent crime and government accountability.
    


            “In fact, the last thing Charlie had texted me about a day or two before he passed away, was about those mayors and governors,” Noem told Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo” on Sunday. She was referring to ongoing discussions about President Donald Trump's crackdown on crime and his push to deploy the National Guard to Democratic-led states, as he did in Washington, DC.
    


            “He wanted them to be held accountable for how dangerous they were making the situation for their people to have to live in those cities,” Noem added.
    


            When asked why Kirk's assassination marked a national turning point, the DHS secretary emphasized its broader impact.
    


            “It feels like a grief has settled on not just the country, but the entire world, something has changed.”
    


            Noem also echoed the administration's criticism of left-wing political rhetoric in the wake of the killing.
    


            “Some of the rhetoric we're seeing out of the left and out of political animals is ugly and it's bitter and it's seeking to seize this opportunity to turn it into evil. And I would just encourage everybody to start focusing on relationships, start focusing on each other and talk about what Charlie believed in.”
    


            Utah Gov. Spencer Cox further elaborated on how investigators have determined that Tyler Robinson, the alleged shooter of Charlie Kirk, had been radicalized, pointing to gaming and “dark internet” culture as potential factors that contributed to a shift.
    


            Cox on CNN's “State of the Union” Sunday gave more details about his comment to the Wall Street Journal last week that Robinson had been “deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology,” suggesting that came from conversations Robinson had with friends.
    


            In an interview on NBC's “Meet the Press” with Kristen Welker, Cox added, “According to family and people that we're interviewing, he does come from a conservative family but his ideology was very different from his family and so that's part of it.”
    


            Robinson, Cox said, is not cooperating with authorities, but they have been able to glean significant information from family, friends, and acquaintances.
    


            Cox suggested things changed for Robinson after he dropped out of Utah State University.
    


            “It seemed to happen kind of after that — after he moved back to the southern part of Utah. Clearly, there was a lot of gaming going on, friends that have confirmed that there was kind of that deep, dark internet, Reddit culture and these other dark places of the internet where this person was going deep. You saw that on the casings. … the meme-ification that is happening in our society today,” he told NBC.
    


            In an interview with ABC's “This Week” with Martha Raddatz, Cox also confirmed reports that acquaintances were joking online with Robinson about photos released by the FBI during the manhunt.
    


            “Those conversations definitely were happening. And they did not believe it was actually him — it was all joking until he admitted that it actually was him,” he said.
    


            Cox, who appeared on a trio of Sunday shows to offer some new details about the investigation, said the White House asked him to.
    


            “I don't do a lot of national media anymore and it was the encouragement of the White House that I'm on this program this morning,” he told Raddatz.
    


            Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, the husband of former Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was shot at an event in 2011, called political violence “a pervasive issue in our country” and cautioned against placing blame with one side.
    


            “Whether you're a governor or senator, a member of the House, president of the United States, you have to be very careful about your words because people are listening,” Kelly said on NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday.
    


            Kelly also criticized social media companies for “exploiting kids” and called for congressional action.
    


            Kelly said his wife, who has been focused on curbing gun violence in the US since she was shot, was particularly affected by Charlie Kirk's assassination.
    


            “I would say this one in particular hit her pretty hard, and it's because she saw the video. You know, the video is all over social media. It's kind of hard to avoid, and you can just kind of stumble right into it,” Kelly said. “I hope some of these social media companies can scrub this off the internet, because it's not good for kids to see this.”
    


            Utah Gov. Spencer Cox has made it a personal campaign to turn down the nation's political temperature and “disagree better” in the wake of Charlie Kirk's murder.
    


            But Trump ally Steve Bannon, meanwhile, has attacked Cox as a “national embarrassment.”
    


            “Mr. Bannon is angry, and rightfully so. And I'm not saying we have to just sing Kumbaya and hold hands. What I'm saying is we actually should disagree. I think Charlie represented that better than anyone. Charlie said some very inflammatory things, and in some corners of the web, that's all people have heard. But he also said some other things about forgiveness,” Cox told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”
    


            He continued, “There are conflict entrepreneurs out there who benefit from radicalizing us. And I'm not one of those. I don't know that that's particularly helpful.”
    


            Cox called for the removal of cell phones in classroom and efforts to hold social media companies to account.
    


            He described the Kirk killing as a “direct assault on America” and called on Americans to “look in the mirror and decide, are we going to try to make it better, or are we going to make it worse?”
    


            Utah Gov. Spencer Cox had previously indicated that shooting suspect Tyler Robinson had discussed Charlie Kirk with his family. Asked on CNN's “State of the Union” on Sunday for more specifics, Cox said that Robinson was “just not a fan,” and declined to elaborate further.
    


            Cox spoke by phone with President Donald Trump after his remarks at a press conference on Friday, he said, describing the call as a “long conversation” and “very sobering.”
    


            According to Atlantic reporter McKay Coppins, Trump told Cox, “The type of person who would do something like that to Charlie Kirk would love to do it to us.”
    


            Asked for his response, Cox told CNN's Dana Bash, “He's not wrong. I mean, he knows better than anyone as someone who literally was injured by a bullet, I mean, a fraction of an inch away from being killed a year ago. He understands that better than anyone.”
    


            He said he was “grateful” that the president has talked about “nonviolence.”
    


            Trump, Cox added, is “also very angry.”
    


            “I get that. This is his close personal friend, and anger is a normal reaction,” he said.
    


            Investigators are looking into a note left by Tyler Robinson, the alleged shooter of Charlie Kirk, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Sunday.
    


            Social and gaming platform Discord vice president Jud Hoffman said in a statement Friday that there were “communications between the suspect's roommate and a friend after the shooting where the roommate was recounting the contents of a note the suspect had left elsewhere.”
    


            Cox appeared to confirm the existence of a note in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union,” but indicated it was still under review.
    


            “Those are things that are still being processed for accuracy and verification and will be included in charging documents,” Cox said.
    


            Pressed by Bash on whether a note was found and its contents were known by law enforcement, he declined to share specifics.
    


            The roommate of Tyler Robinson, Charlie Kirk's alleged shooter, was a romantic partner of Robinson and transitioning from male to female, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Sunday. Investigators are looking into whether that was a factor in last week's assassination.
    


            “Yes. I can confirm that. I know that has been reported, and that the FBI has confirmed that as well – that the roommate was a romantic partner, a male transitioning to female,” Cox said in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”
    


            The roommate, Cox added, “has been incredibly cooperative, had no idea that this was happening, and is working with investigators right now.”
    


            Asked by Bash whether the roommate's status was relevant to the investigation and a potential motive, Cox said it was “easy to draw conclusions” but declined to speculate.
    


            “I know everybody wants to know exactly why, and point the finger. And I totally get that. I do too, and so I just want to be careful, as I haven't read all of the interview transcripts, and so we'll have to wait and see what comes out,” he said.
    


            Cox was asked about previous comments that Robinson had been indoctrinated with “leftist ideology.” He said that information “comes from the people around him, from his family members and his friends.”
    


            Official charges, Cox said, will be filed on Tuesday.
    


            President Donald Trump issued an ultimatum yesterday to NATO allies in a letter, saying that the US will issue “major” sanctions on Russia only when NATO countries agree to do the same and stop buying oil from Russia.
    


            Trump's demands would mark a major shift in policies among the alliance, and there are major questions as to whether there could be collective interest in taking these steps.
    


            “I am ready to do major Sanctions on Russia when all NATO Nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all NATO Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA,” he said in a post to social media, quoting what he said was a letter sent to his NATO counterparts.
    


                    He continued, “As you know, NATO'S commitment to WIN has been far less than 100%, and the purchase of Russian Oil, by some, has been shocking! It greatly weakens your negotiating position, and bargaining power, over Russia. Anyway, I am ready to ‘go' when you are. Just say when?”
                





            The president also called on NATO countries to significantly ramp up tariffs on China in a show of force.
    


            “I believe that this, plus NATO, as a group, placing 50% to 100% TARIFFS ON CHINA, to be fully withdrawn after the WAR with Russia and Ukraine is ended, will also be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR,” he said.
    


            Trump added that Russia's war in Ukraine would end “quickly” if those steps are taken.
    


            CNN has previously reported that the European Union imposed a ban on maritime Russian oil imports and refined oil products like diesel, but many countries continue to import Russian fossil fuels and liquefied natural gas.
    


            President Donald Trump announced Friday that his administration would target Memphis as part of his efforts to crack down on crime in major US cities.
    


            Calling the city “deeply troubled,” Trump suggested the mayor and Tennessee governor were happy with the action, which could include the “National Guard and anybody else we need.”
    


City leaders push back: But Memphis Mayor Paul Young said at a Friday afternoon news conference that it was not done at his request, asserting that he learned in the morning “that the President and Governor are looking to bring Federal resources to our city which include the National Guard, which they have the authority to do.”
    


                    “I want to be clear I did not ask for the National Guard and I don't think it is the way to drive down crime,” he said. “However, that decision has already been made.”
                





            Yesterday, Young told CNN's Victor Blackwell that he didn't have official confirmation until Trump announced it Friday during an interview with Fox News, but he “learned earlier this week that it was under consideration.”
    


Pivot from Chicago: Trump had previously threatened — using incendiary rhetoric — to send troops to address crime in Chicago. But while the Department of Homeland Security has announced an immigration crackdown there, troops have not been mobilized.
    


            The president shelved his plan for Chicago after advisers warned him it could create legal headaches without buy-in from the state's governor, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            While Memphis is a Democratic city, Tennessee's Republican governor appears more willing to accept federal intervention than Illinois' Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker, who has been in a war of words with Trump.
    


CNN's Michelle Watson contributed reporting to this post. 



            For the approximately 40 hours between the assassination of Charlie Kirk and the announcement Friday that a suspect was apprehended, finger-pointing reigned on the right.
    


            Some Republicans and right-wing pundits and influencers spoke of “war” and their side becoming radicalized in response. President Donald Trump, who'd floated cracking down on leftists and liberal organizations he baselessly blamed for political violence, topped it off Friday morning by suggesting conservative extremists have been radicalized for legitimate reasons, while saying “radicals on the left are the problem.”
    


            At a time when politicians and presidents usually call for calm and unity, his rhetoric was throwing fuel on the fire. And it wasn't difficult to see how that could lead to even more ugly places.
    


            But the tragedy in Utah also happens to have cast a spotlight on Utah Gov. Spencer Cox — a Republican who has spent years calling for quite the opposite approach: a more civil and less angry version of politics.
    


            During two news conferences last week, Cox used his speaking time to project a far different message than that of Trump and leading MAGA figures.
    


            He at one point explicitly decried the tendency to “point the finger at the other side,” something Trump and others have repeatedly done.
    


                    “We can return violence with violence. We can return hate with hate. And that's the problem with political violence,” Cox said. “It metastasizes, because we can always point the finger at the other side. And at some point, we have to find an off-ramp, or it's going to get much, much worse.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","He wears a red beret everywhere and once had 17 cats. Now he's the wildcard of the NYC mayoral race","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/14/politics/curtis-sliwa-nyc-mayoral-race","Sun, 14 Sep 2025 12:00:06 GMT","


            Curtis Sliwa's preferred campaign mode is riding the subway. He boards trains in the back car, then chats and handshakes his way forward, one by one, through the riders that he leaves just with a business card about his candidacy. He asks everyone where they grew up.
    


            The responses are part minor celebrity sighting, part genuine affection. One man looked up from his book about the 1998 Yankees to say, “Oh, it's you!” A Staten Island Ferry attendant held the boat for him, saying “We got you, Curtis.”
    


            Every New Yorker he finds, Sliwa asks where they went to high school. To Danish tourists, he talked about the bathroom attendants at Copenhagen Central Station. To those with dogs, he reaches down to pet them. To one from Dorchester, Massachusetts: “I'm all about Boston, but I must tell you, I hate the Red Sox.” To a homeless woman sleeping on the train who started to sit up as he bent on a knee to gently offer a can of ginger ale: “You can lay back down.”
    


            Sliwa is the founder of the Guardian Angels, an anti-crime patrol group started in the depths of the city's worst years in the 1970s, and he has been known for his red beret long before launching what is now his second consecutive run as the Republican nominee for mayor. The never-ending weirdness of this mayor's race has put Sliwa in a position to shape it – and to prove to many in his own party that they should take him seriously.
    


            Sliwa has been a part of New Yorkers' lives for so long that the comparatives stack up easily: For longer than many of the now-redeveloped neighborhoods across the five boroughs have had their foundations poured. For longer than Big Apple crime rates have been tracked by computer. For a decade and a half longer than Zohran Mamdani has been alive.
    


            And for so long that he has a black-and-white photo of himself with Donald Trump from 1986, when they were both on the rise as tabloid favorites. Trump is in a tuxedo. Sliwa is in a Guardian Angels T-shirt and, naturally, his beret.
    


            Times have changed. These days, as interested as the president is in the mayor's race and stopping Mamdani from winning, Trump won't back Sliwa.
    


            “I'm a Republican, but Curtis is not exactly prime time. He wants cats in Gracie Mansion,” the president said on Friday when asked about the race in an appearance on Fox News. “We don't need to have thousands of cats.”
    


            In the most splintered, unpredictable general election race in the history of a city where politics is always a circus, Sliwa has New York political observers wondering: Is his candidacy a missed opportunity to take advantage of a split among Democrats? Or is having a person with the notoriety and connections beyond the city's long-withered Republican base the only longshot that could actually, maybe, somehow work?
    


            “When they come up to me, they don't say, ‘Oh, the Republican,'” Sliwa said in an interview in a tiled, not-too-dirty alcove of a subway station. “They don't see me as a politician. They see me as one of them, which is rare.”
    


            Even after a life that's included four marriages and being shot five times in a taxi that he says was a hired hit from mob boss John Gotti, this year's race has Sliwa falling back late at night and early in the morning on electronic dance music. The beats, he says, help him focus.
    


            Trump was referring to the story of Sliwa having, at one point, 17 cats in his small Upper West Side apartment. The candidate told CNN that was because he was taking cats in from people getting rid of their pets during the pandemic — and now he's down to just six.
    


            Sliwa did not respond to Trump on Friday. His sister, the media director of the campaign, instead sent a statement from his campaign manager that didn't mention the president but went in depth about his long history of caring for pets and having a vision about animal welfare along with increasing affordability, being tough on crime and enhancing quality of life. In addition to being the Republican nominee, Sliwa is running this fall on a second, independent ballot line called “Protect Animals.”
    


            The local and national conversation around the mayor's race has focused on incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who met with a key Trump White House aide to discuss potential job offers if he were to drop out. Some want opposition to Mamdani to coalesce around Andrew Cuomo, the former New York governor running as an independent after losing to Mamdani in the Democratic primary.
    


            For now, Adams is staying in the race. Polls show Mamdani in a strong position ahead of the November election, with more establishment Democrats warming to him although top party leaders are still withholding endorsements.
    


            Sliwa has been all but forgotten in the discussion – but he's outpolling Adams.  A poll from The New York Times and Siena College found Mamdani with 46% support and Cuomo at 24% support. Sliwa was at 15% and Adams at 9%.
    


            Some believe that only an ingrained figure like Sliwa could attract enough Democrats in the last weeks of the campaign to have a chance. Others see his candidacy as a missed opportunity, wishing a more conventional Republican had been around to take advantage of the splintered mess of the Democratic candidates and spend more time talking about governing.
    


            Sliwa pulled almost 28% as the Republican nominee for mayor four years ago, with 312,000 votes. Since then, Lee Zeldin, the Republican nominee for governor in 2022, got 542,000 votes out of New York City, while Trump got 838,000 votes out of the city last year.
    


            The other three candidates and many in their bases can't stand each other. And there's no ranked-choice voting in November like there was in the primary.
    


            In other words: Though Zeldin and Trump each got only about 30% in New York City, in a splintered field with multiple viable candidates, being elected the next mayor could take far less than a majority.
    


            But while billionaire John Catsimatidis has been trying to corral efforts to beat Mamdani, including his calls to the president, his longtime friend, he hasn't been pushing for Sliwa. That's despite Sliwa endorsing Catsimatidis in his own Republican run for mayor in 2013 and as the billionaire's daughter, as the Manhattan Republican chair, is supporting Sliwa after declining calls to run for mayor herself.
    


            “The world's not going to come to an end if Curtis is mayor,” was how Catsimatidis put it in an interview with CNN, calling his one-time fellow local radio host “an entertainer.”
    


            “He knows the city and wants to do the right thing,” he said. “He might have a shot.”
    


            Sliwa dismissed Catsimatidis and other wealthy figures like billionaire investor Bill Ackman who are intensely opposed to Mamdani and democratic socialism but have never given him a real look.
    


            “The billionaires have no influence in this campaign,” Sliwa said. “These billionaires know nothing about politics because they're not in the streets.”
    


            As for Trump, Sliwa previously told CNN he voted for the president for the first time last year and agrees with much of what he is doing, but they haven't talked for years. Even before the president's swipe at him on Friday, he insisted he wanted neither a job offer nor an endorsement.
    


            He does like to talk about the first time their politics converged, though: the night that photo was taken, when they were both honored in 1986 by the state Conservative Party.
    


            “He looks to me and he goes, ‘Curtis, what are we gonna do?' I said, ‘I don't know, Donald, you're not a conservative, I'm not a conservative.' He goes, ‘Let's make the best of it,'” Sliwa recalled.
    


            Sliwa has already been raising more money than Cuomo or Adams. He likes to point out he hasn't even started advertising beyond the 100,000 New Yorkers he estimates he's given one of his business cards to on the subway.
    


            “Curtis is more than just a red beret and always has been. He works hard, he's concerned about the policies. He knows New York City from the bottom up,” said New York State GOP chairman Ed Cox, who, in the tiny world of city GOP politics, is the son-in-law of Richard Nixon and whose son used to be married to Catsimatidis' daughter. “You've got three very flawed Democrats—if those three split up the Democratic vote, guess what, with the Republican vote and the Trump vote, that's a clear win for Curtis.”
    


            How much Republican institutional support will be there for Sliwa, given city campaign finance laws limiting coordination as well as Trump and other Republicans' machinations in favor of Cuomo, Cox would not say.
    


            “He has spent four decades working on behalf of the city—but from his heart, not as a public servant,” said US Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, who represents Staten Island and a part of Brooklyn and is the only Republican in the city's congressional delegation.
    


            A candidate who was “a little more polished,” Malliotakis said, “might be stronger, but when it comes down to actual experience and knowing the ins and outs of this city… that's what we're hoping happens here, that people recognize that like Sesame Street, one of these things is not like the other.”
    


            But Malliotakis is behind him. So is Elise Stefanik, the upstate congresswoman gearing up to run for governor next year, who has endorsed him and whose candidacy Sliwa says he could boost with a win of his own – just like when Rudy Giuliani was first elected in 1993 and a Republican beat Cuomo's father, then the incumbent governor, the following year.
    


            An aide to Stefanik, though, did not respond to multiple requests to interview the congresswoman about Sliwa.
    


            “You don't win with Republicans in New York City,” Sliwa said, arguing that of his 2021 vote share, “most of it was independents — double the number of Republicans — and moderate Democrats.”
    


            Affordability concerns moved voters to Mamdani in the spring as those crime worries faded, but Sliwa believes they are spiking again. Even on affordability, Sliwa says his years watching projects and promises flounder across the city has left him with a more demanding perspective.
    


            “All these candidates say, ‘Five years from now, 10 years from now, we'll have 500,000 apartments here,'” Sliwa said. “What are we going to do now to create affordable housing, not then?”
    


            As opposed to Mamdani, who is proposing tax hikes on the wealthy, Sliwa wants to cut income, property and corporate taxes, while shrinking city spending to attract new development.
    


            For the Guardian Angel, the conversation always comes back to crime. Sliwa wants police officers off the subway platforms and patrolling the train cars in pairs.
    


            “‘It's really not bad in the subway,'” Sliwa said, mocking the way he says he hears the other mayoral candidates talking as he spoke to reporters outside a subway station last weekend. “Easy for them to say, like Eric Adams, because he's never in the subways unless he has a total NYPD armed security team with him. You don't see Zohran in the subway. And by the way, if they built a subway extension to the Hamptons, you might see Andy Cuomo out in the suburbs.”
    


            Sliwa doesn't spend much time thinking about what would happen if somehow he wins. But one thing he realized, as he stood there: he'd have to change his own subway routine to accept a police detail if he did.
    


            “Well, that's different. Obviously, that is almost mandated that you have to have a detail with you,” Sliwa said. “So, I'll learn to live with it.”

            Hours after a gunman killed conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Rob Sand, the Democratic Iowa state auditor who is running for governor, said the way forward comes from the teachings of Jesus: “Love your enemies.”
    


            “Everybody out there, no matter what their ideas are, is a child of God. And I don't think we should be conceiving of ourselves as enemies, even as we may be working for different things,” he told CNN hours after Kirk's death.
    


            Sand, who grew up attending Lutheran church, is part of a growing group of Democratic candidates in next year's midterm elections that are seeking to use faith to find common ground with voters — including independents and Republicans — in states where their party has struggled to win in recent years.
    


            Those candidates are bucking broader, yearslong trends: the Democratic electorate is increasingly secular, while growing shares of those who attend church regularly identify themselves as Republicans.
    


            Their 2026 campaigns will test whether church-going, Bible-quoting Democrats can connect with voters — and provide an early gauge of whether messages rooted in spirituality will appeal to the party's base ahead of a 2028 presidential primary that could feature a number of religiously observant candidates who have long openly discussed their faith.
    


            In the wake of Kirk's killing at a Utah college Wednesday, the latest in a horrific rise in political violence across the United States in recent years, those Democrats who are placing faith at the forefront of their campaigns turned to religion for answers.
    


            In Texas, state Rep. James Talarico, a pastor who launched his Senate campaign last week, scrapped his plans for a rally in San Antonio hours after Kirk was killed. Instead, he told supporters that “there is something broken in this country.”
    


            “My faith — the faith I shared with Charlie Kirk — teaches me to love my neighbors as myself. Not just my neighbors who look like me or pray like me or vote like me; I am called to love all of my neighbors like I love myself,” Talarico said.
    


            He called for “a politics of love,” and said he was tired of being told to “hate my neighbor.”
    


            “We have to find a way back to each other,” Talarico said. “We have to recognize one another as full human beings. We have to love one another. That is easier said than done, but it is necessary if we're going to continue this American experiment.”
    


            Sand similarly drew on his faith as he lambasted what he described as warped incentives across the political spectrum.
    


            “A lot of this has to do with the political system that leads political leaders into temptation: the temptation to demonize their opponents; the temptation to lie about their opponents' records; the temptation to exaggerate and make sound more dangerous the things that elected officials want or that our neighbors want,” he said. “All that leads us down a very dark path, because we have a system where that can be an effective strategy.”
    


            Aside from their faith, Sand and Talarico have another thing in common: They're both seen by Democrats as promising candidates in what will likely be uphill red-state races.
    


            Talarico faces a competitive primary in the Texas Senate contest, where he will take on the party's 2024 Senate nominee, former US Rep. Colin Allred. Republican Sen. John Cornyn is seeking reelection, but has a stiff primary challenge of his own, as controversial conservative Attorney General Ken Paxton – who Democrats see as the weaker general election candidate – runs against him from the right.
    


            In Iowa, Sand is the favorite in a contested Democratic gubernatorial primary. But the winner of the crowded GOP primary will be the favorite in a state President Donald Trump won by 13 percentage points in 2024.
    


            Both Democrats aren't just talking about what their faith means in personal terms — they're connecting it to their own political positions and what the party should stand for.
    


            Talarico first drew the national spotlight in 2023 with viral videos opposing requiring public schools to display the Ten Commandments. Republicans, he pointed out, were violating the Fourth Commandment to “keep the Sabbath holy” by passing the bill on a Saturday – the Jewish Sabbath.
    


            “This bill to me is not only unconstitutional; it's not only un-American; I think it is also deeply un-Christian,” he told his Republican colleagues in a committee hearing. “And I say that because I believe this bill is idolatrous. I believe it is exclusionary. And I believe that it is arrogant — and those three things, in my reading of the Gospel, are diametrically opposed to the teachings of Jesus.”
    


            Those videos earned him an appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast this July, where Rogan — who said he'd been encouraged to watch the videos by a friend — told Talarico during their two-and-a-half hour conversation that he should run for president.
    


            Sand, on the campaign trail, has a frequent refrain: “Jesus is for the little guy,” and the Democratic Party at its best is, too, he tells event attendees.
    


            In Iowa — a state where Democrats won three House seats in 2018, but are seeking to reverse a rapid, rightward shift in recent years — several House candidates aren't just talking about faith; it's part of their resumes. Lindsay Jones, a Presbyterian pastor and four-term state representative, is running in the 2nd District. Sarah Trone Garriott, who is running in the 3rd District, is an ordained Lutheran minister.
    


            Those candidates are far from the first Democrats to make faith a prominent part of their messages, even in recent years.
    


            Former President Joe Biden often discussed his Catholic faith, as has former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro made his Jewish faith a prominent part of his 2022 campaign; he said in an ad that no matter where he starts his week, he makes it home on Friday nights for Sabbath dinner, “because family and faith ground me.” Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock is the senior pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. once preached. He describes himself as a “Matthew 25 Christian,” referring to the New Testament verse that calls for acts of service and social justice.
    


            However, the Democratic Party's electorate has become increasingly secular. A Pew Research Center survey published in February found that more than three-quarters of atheists and agnostics identify themselves as Democrats or lean toward the Democratic Party.
    


            Meanwhile, 61% of Americans classified by the survey as “highly religious” are Republicans or Republican-leaning. Among Hispanics — a group that shifted strongly in the GOP's favor in the 2024 election — 54% of Catholics align with the Democratic Party, while 58% of Hispanic evangelicals align with the GOP. And highly religious Hispanic Americans are more likely to align with the Republicans than the Democrats, 48% to 40%.
    


            Those trends, many Democrats said, come in part as a reaction to Republicans using religious messages to advance conservative positions on issues like gay rights and abortion — and after watching many religious leaders rally behind President Donald Trump and other GOP figures.
    


            At times, those tensions break through and reveal deep divides within the Democratic Party over the role of religion in government.
    


            Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee, faced sharp criticism from Republicans — including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz — after his comments at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing earlier this month. “The notion that rights don't come from laws and don't come from the government, but come from the creator — that's what the Iranian government believes,” Kaine said.
    


            Cruz said on X that “the casual condemnation of America's founding principle is exactly what is wrong with today's Democrat Party.”
    


            “Government protects our God-given rights, it does not create or destroy them,” Cruz said.
    


            Talarico told Semafor he agrees with Cruz. “I do believe that our freedoms and our rights come from God. They don't come from a president. They don't come from a Caesar or a pharaoh. They come from something deeper,” he said.
    


            Sand, the Iowa Democrat running for governor, said when he was in high school, he struggled with questions about whether he wanted to talk openly about his faith as he saw coverage of the Westboro Baptist Church, a Kansas church known for using hateful slogans in its protests against gay people.
    


            “I remember thinking, ‘I don't know if I can go around and tell people that I'm a Christian if this is what they're going to believe about me,'” he said. “But my belief overwhelmed that, and I realized that I almost had an obligation to be outspoken about my faith, because otherwise the actual message about my faith is lost to the people that would misconstrue it to advance their own ends.”
    


            Sand said when he is struggling to articulate what he believes, “the easiest way for me to think about it is to ask myself — I know this might sound corny, but — ‘What would Jesus do?'”
    


            “If I want to figure out why I care about something, I can ask myself, ‘Well, what did I read in the Bible when I was a kid about something like this?'” he said.
    


            Still, many Democrats have tried connecting with voters through faith — and failed.
    


            In 2018, Chris King, a progressive evangelical Christian, drew national headlines with a Florida gubernatorial run in which he described himself as a case study of whether faith would be a deal-killer in the modern Democratic Party. He ultimately won just 2% in the primary, and months later narrowly lost as the party's nominee for lieutenant governor.
    


            King told CNN that what's most important for Democrats seeking to make religion a core part of their message is that “it is truly an authentic expression of their faith.” That, he said, is because Democratic voters “are particularly skeptical of candidates who are trying to be preachy or overly religious.”
    


            “I think the challenge is to be precise and specific and not preachy about why you believe what you believe, and why it will help people,” he said.
    


            King added that many Democratic voters are now “looking for a fighter.”
    


            “When you're talking about faith, like I did, you're talking often about humility and kindness, inclusion, generosity,” he said. “Those are not necessarily the values of our time.”
    


            Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, who earned a graduate degree at Yale Divinity School, has long urged Democrats to talk more openly about faith. In a July appearance on Jesuitical, a podcast for young Catholics, he said that “there's many more elected Democrats in the Senate who are regular participants in a prayer breakfast or a reflection group or a spirituality group than you might imagine.”
    


            He said watching conservative Republicans use religion to argue for abortion restrictions led some Democrats to distance themselves from faith. Others, Coons said, began to see organized religion in a negative light after being rejected for their identities or sexuality.
    


            “Our parties have gotten more and more sharply defined by a few issues, and the American people, in my experience, don't live their lives that way,” Coons said.
    


            “The modern division here in Washington does reflect a deep division in our country. And there are families that have stopped having Thanksgiving together. And there are congregations and parishes that are more divided because of politics here,” he said. “But I think it's our challenge and our call to model more humility and more grace.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Family and friends of the 22-year-old accused of fatally shooting conservative activist Charlie Kirk described his politics as veering left in recent years as he spent large amounts of time scrolling the “dark corners of the internet,” Utah Gov. Spencer Spencer Cox said Sunday.

Investigators were still piecing together information about the suspect, Tyler Robinson, and not yet ready to discuss a potential motive. But Cox noted that Robinson, who is not cooperating with law enforcement, disliked Kirk and may have been “radicalized” online.

“There clearly was a leftist ideology,” Cox said on NBC's “Meet the Press,” citing interviews with Robinson's relatives and acquaintances. “Friends have confirmed that there was kind of that deep, dark internet, the Reddit culture, and these other dark places of the internet where this person was going deep.”

He pointed to references found engraved on the ammunition used to kill Kirk, which included anti-fascist and meme-culture language. Court records show that one bullet casing had the message, “Hey, fascist! Catch!” 

A Republican who has called on all partisans to tone down their rhetoric following the attack, the governor added: “I really don't have a dog in this fight. If this was a radicalized MAGA person, I'd be saying that as well.”

Cox stressed on several Sunday morning news shows, however, that investigators are still trying to pin down a motive for the attack on Kirk, a father of two and Trump confidant who was killed Wednesday while on one of his signature college speaking tours at Utah Valley University. The governor said more information may come out once Robinson appears in court Tuesday.

Cox said the suspect's partner was transgender, which some politicians have pointed to as a sign Robinson was targeting Kirk, the founder of Turning Points USA, for his anti-trans views. But authorities have not said whether it is relevant as they investigate Robinson's motive.




“The roommate was a romantic partner, a male transitioning to female,” Cox said. “I can say that he has been incredibly cooperative, this partner has been very cooperative, had no idea that this was happening.”

Investigators have spoken to Robinson's relatives and carried out a search warrant at his family's home in Washington, about 240 miles (390 kilometers) southwest of Utah Valley University, where the shooting took place. 

State records show Robinson is registered to vote but not affiliated with a political party and is listed as inactive, meaning he did not vote in the two most recent general elections. His parents are registered Republicans.

Robinson grew up around St. George, in the southwestern corner of Utah between Las Vegas and natural landmarks including Bryce Canyon and Zion National Parks. 

Robinson became a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, known widely as the Mormon church, at a young age, church spokesperson Doug Andersen said.

Robinson has two younger brothers, and his parents have been married for about 25 years, according to social media posts. Online activity by Robinson's mother reflects an active family that took vacations to Disneyland, Hawaii, the Caribbean and Alaska. 

Like many in that part of Utah, they frequently spent time outdoors — boating, fishing, riding ATVs, zip-lining and target shooting. A 2017 post shows the family visiting a military facility and posing with assault rifles. A young Robinson is seen smiling as he grips the handles of a .50-caliber heavy machine gun.

A high school honor roll student who scored in the 99th percentile nationally on standardized tests, he was admitted to Utah State University in 2021 on a prestigious academic scholarship, according to a video of him reading his acceptance letter that was posted to a family member's social media account.

But he attended for only one semester, according to the university. He is currently enrolled as a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College in St. George.

NEW YORK (AP) — In the days following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, numerous workers have been fired for their comments on his death, among them MSNBC political analyst Matthew Dowd.

Several conservative activists have sought to identify social media users whose posts about Kirk they viewed as offensive or celebratory, targeting everyone from journalists to teachers. Right-wing influencer Laura Loomer said she would try to ruin the professional aspirations of anyone who celebrated Kirk's death.

It's far from the first time workers have lost their jobs over things they say publicly — including in social media posts. But the speed at which the firings have been happening raises questions about worker rights versus employer rights.

In the U.S., laws can vary across states, but overall, there's very little legal protections for employees who are punished for speech made both in and out of private workplaces. 

“Most people think they have a right to free speech…but that doesn't necessarily apply in the workplace,” said Vanessa Matsis-McCready, associate general counsel and vice president of HR Services for Engage PEO. “Most employees in the private sector do not have any protections for that type of speech at work.”

Add to that the prevalence of social media, which has made it increasingly common to track employees' conduct outside of work and to dox people, or publish information about them online with the intent of harming or harassing them.

Protections for workers vary from one state to the next. For example, in New York, if an employee is participating in a weekend political protest, but not associating themselves with the organization that employs them, their employer cannot fire them for that activity when they return to work. But if that same employee is at a company event on a weekend and talks about their political viewpoints in a way that makes others feel unsafe or the target of discrimination or harassment, then they could face consequences at work, Matsis-McCready said.

Most of the U.S. defaults to “at-will” employment law — which essentially means employers can choose to hire and fire as they see fit, including over employees' speech.

“The First Amendment does not apply in private workplaces to protect employees' speech,” said Andrew Kragie, an attorney who specializes in employment and labor law at Maynard Nexsen. “It actually does protect employers' right to make decisions about employees, based on employees' speech.”

Kragie said there are “pockets of protection” around the U.S. under various state laws, such as statutes that forbid punishing workers for their political views. But the interpretation of how that gets enforced changes, he notes, making the waters murky.

Steven T. Collis, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin and faculty director of the school's Bech-Loughlin First Amendment Center, also points to some state laws that say employers can't fire their workers for “legal off duty conduct.” But there's often an exception for conduct seen as disruptive to an employer's business or reputation, which could be grounds to fire someone over public comments or social media posts.

“In this scenario, if somebody feels like one of their employees has done something that suggests they are glorifying or celebrating a murder, an employer might still be able to fire them even with one of those laws on the books,” Collis said.

For public employees, which can range from school teachers and postal workers to elected officials, the process is a bit different. That's because the First Amendment plays a unique role when the government is the employer, Collis explains. The Supreme Court has ruled that if an employee is acting in a private capacity but speaking on a matter of public concern, they could be protected. Still, he noted that government employers can discipline a worker if they determine such conduct will interfere with the government's ability to do its job.

Some in the public sector have already worked to restrict speech in the aftermath of Kirk's death. For instance, leaders at the Pentagon unveiled a “zero tolerance” policy for any posts or comments from troops that make light of or celebrate the killing of Kirk.

The policy, announced by the Pentagon's top spokesman Sean Parnell on social media Thursday, came hours after numerous conservative military influencers and activists began forwarding posts they considered problematic to Parnell and his boss, defense secretary Pete Hegseth.

“It is unacceptable for military personnel and Department of War civilians to celebrate or mock the assassination of a fellow American,” Parnell wrote Thursday.

The ubiquity of social media is making it easier than ever to share opinions about politics and major news events as they're unfolding. But posting on social media leaves a record, and in times of escalating political polarization, those declarations can be seen as damaging to the reputation of an individual or their employer. 

“People don't realize when they're on social media, it is the town square,” said Amy Dufrane, CEO of the Human Resource Certification Institute. “They're not having a private conversation with the neighbor over the fence. They're really broadcasting their views.”

Political debates are certainly not limited to social media and are increasingly making their way into the workplace as well.

“The gamification of the way we communicate in the workplace, Slack and Teams, chat and all these things, they're very similar to how you might interact on Instagram or other social media, so I do think that makes it feel a little less formal and somebody might be more inclined to take to take a step and say, ‘Oh, I can't believe this happened,'” Matsis-McCready said. 

In the tense, divided climate of the U.S., many human resource professionals have expressed that they're unprepared to address politically charged discussions in the workplace, according to the Human Resource Certification Institute. But those conversations are going to happen, so employers need to set policies about what is acceptable or unacceptable workplace conduct, Dufrane said.

“HR has got to really drill down and make sure that they're super clear on their policies and practices and communicating to their employees on what are their responsibilities as an employee of the organization,” Dufrane said. 

Many employers are reviewing their policies on political speech and providing training about what appropriate conduct looks like, both inside and outside the organization, she said. And the brutal nature of Kirk's killing may have led some of them to react more strongly in the days that followed his death. 

“Because of the violent nature of what some political discussion is now about, I think there is a real concern from employers that they want to keep the workplace safe and that they're being extra vigilant about anything that could be viewed as a threat, which is their duty,” Matsis-McCreedy said.

Employees can also be seen as ambassadors of a company's brand, and their political speech can dilute that brand and hurt its reputation, depending on what is being said and how it is being received. That is leading more companies to act on what employees are saying online, she said.

“Some of the individuals that had posted and their posts went viral, all of a sudden the phone lines of their employers were just nonstop calls complaining,” Matsis-McCready said. 

Still, experts like Collis don't anticipate a significant change in how employers monitor their workers speech — noting that online activity has come under the spotlight for at least the last 15 years.

“Employers are already and have been for a very long time, vetting employees based on what they're posting on social media,” he said.

NEW YORK (AP) — Bobby Hart, a key part of the Monkees' multimedia empire who teamed with Tommy Boyce on such hits as “Last Train to Clarksville” and “I'm Not Your Steppin' Stone,” has died. He was 86. 

Hart died at his home in Los Angeles, according to his friend and co-author, Glenn Ballantyne. He had been in poor health since breaking his hip last year. 

Boyce and Hart were a prolific and successful team in the mid-1960s, especially for the Monkees, the made-for-television group promoted by Don Kirshner. They wrote the Monkees' theme song, with its opening shot, “Here we come, walkin' down the street,” and enduring chant, “Hey, hey, we're the Monkees,” and their first No. 1 hit, “Last Train to Clarksville.” The Monkees' eponymous, million-selling debut album included six songs from Boyce and Hart, who also served as producers and used their own backing musicians, the Candy Store Prophets, as session players.

“I always credit them not only with writing many of our biggest hits, but, as producers, being instrumental in creating the unique Monkee sound we all know and love,” the Monkees' Micky Dolenz wrote in a foreword to Hart's memoir, “Psychedelic Bubblegum,” published in 2015.

As Boyce and Hart grew in fame and the Monkees took more control of their work, they pursued their own careers, releasing the albums “Test Patterns” and “I Wonder What She's Doing Tonite” and appearing on such sitcoms as “I Dream of Jeannie” and “Bewitched.” They also were politically active. They campaigned for Robert F. Kennedy when he ran for president in 1968 and wrote the brassy “L.U.V. (Let Us Vote)” in support of the 26th Amendment, which in 1971 lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. Their other songs included the Monkees' melancholy “I Wanna Be Free” and the theme to the daytime soap opera “Days of Our Lives.” 




They were covered by everyone from Dean Martin (“Little Lovely One”) to the Sex Pistols (“I'm Not Your Steppin' Stone”).

In the 1970s and ‘80s, Hart managed several hits with other collaborators and even contributed material to another TV act, the Partridge Family. He worked with Austin Roberts on “Over You,” an Oscar-nominated ballad performed by Betty Buckley in “Tender Mercies,” and with Dick Eastman on “My Secret (Didja Gitit Yet?)” for New Edition. He and Bryce toured with Dolenz and fellow Monkee Davy Jones in the ‘70s, put out the album “Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart” and received renewed attention when the Monkees enjoyed a comeback in the 1980s.

Boyce, who died in 1994, and Hart were the subjects of a 2014 documentary “The Guys Who Wrote ‘Em.” Hart was married twice, most recently to singer Mary Ann Hart, and had two children from his first marriage.

He was a minister's son, born Robert Luke Harshman in Phoenix, Arizona. In his memoir, he remembered himself as a shy kid with a “strong desire to distinguish” himself, as he wrote in “Psychedelic Bubblegum.” Music was the answer. By high school, he had learned piano, guitar and the Hammond B-3 organ. He also started his own amateur radio station, eventually adding a console, turntables and microphones. After graduating from high school and serving in the Army reserves, he settled in Los Angeles in the late 1950s, hoping first to become a disc jockey, but soon working as a songwriter and session musician. His name shortened to Bobby Hart, he toured as a member of Teddy Randazzo and the Dazzlers, and with Randazzo and Bobby Weinstein wrote “Hurt So Bad,” a hit for Little Anthony and the Imperials later covered by Linda Ronstadt.

He also befriended Boyce, a singer and songwriter from Charlottesville, Virginia, with a “very unusual personality, spontaneous and extroverted, yet very cool at the same time.” Boyce and Hart helped write the top 10 hit “Come a Little Bit Closer” for Jay and the Americans and were a strong enough combination that Kirshner recruited them for his Screen Gems songwriting factory: They were assigned to the Monkees. Asked to come up with songs for a quartet openly modeled on the Beatles, they devised a twangy guitar line similar to the one for “Paperback Writer” and wrote “Last Train to Clarksville,” a chart topper in 1966. When Kirshner suggested a song with a girl's name in the title, they turned out “Valleri” and reached the top 5.

For the show's theme song, a stroll outside was enough.

“Boyce began strumming his guitar and I joined in by snapping my fingers & making noises with my mouth that simulated an open & closed hi-hat cymbal,” Hart wrote in his memoir. “We had created the perfect recipe for inspiration and started singing about just what we were doing: ‘Walkin' down the street.'”

DENVER (AP) — From the moment conservative activist and icon Charlie Kirk was felled by an assassin's bullet, partisans began fighting over which side was to blame. President Donald Trump became the most prominent to do so, tying the attack to “the radical left” before a suspect was even identified.

It was part of a new, grim tradition in a polarized country — trying to pin immediate responsibility for an act of public violence on one of two political sides. As the nation reels from a wave of physical attacks against both Republicans and Democrats, experts warn that the rush to blame sometimes ambiguous and irrational acts on political movements could lead to more conflict.

“What you're seeing now is exactly how the spiral of violence occurs,” said Robert Pape, a political scientist and director of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats at the University of Chicago.

On Friday, authorities announced they had arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson of Washington, Utah, in the shooting. While a registered voter, he was not affiliated with any party and had not voted in the last two general elections. Even so, officials said Robinson had recently grown more political and expressed negative views about Kirk.

There was other initial evidence of Robinson's potential influences. According to court papers, he carved taunting phrases into his ammunition — including one bullet casing marked with “Hey, fascist! Catch!” — and others from the irony-laden world of memes and online video games.

Experts say political assassins don't always fall into neatly sorted partisan categories. In some cases, like that of Thomas Mathew Crooks, who shot Trump at a Pennsylvania campaign rally last year, there is little record of any political stances whatsoever. The FBI has said Crooks also had researched then-President Joe Biden as a possible attack target.

Bruce Hoffman, who studies terrorism at Georgetown University, noted that the FBI has created a new category, Nihilistic Violent Extremism, to track the increasing number of attacks that seem to have no clear political motivation.

“Extremism is becoming a salad bowl of ideologies where you can pick whatever you want,” Hoffman said, adding that the increasing number of lone wolf attacks means violence is increasingly unmoored from organizations with clear political goals.

What's more important than the attackers' state of mind, experts stressed, is the broader political environment. The more heated the atmosphere, the more likely it'll lead unstable people to commit violence.

“What they all share is a political ecosystem that's very permissive about violence towards political rivals,” Arie Perlinger, a professor of security studies at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell, said of recent perpetrators of political violence. “Because politicians are incentivized to use extreme rhetoric and extreme language, that leads to demonization of political rivals.”

Pete Buttigieg, a former Democratic presidential candidate who engages frequently with the right on Fox News and other forums, sees social media as a fever swamp driving the demonization and danger.

“Many people around America, normal people, not dangerous people, were at a moment when we all should have still been praying for the victim and his family,” he said Sunday on NBC's “Meet the Press.” Instead they were “busy online praying for some shred of evidence that the shooter would turn out to be from the other political team. That is not healthy.”

That certainly happened after the Kirk killing. The 31-year-old father of two young children was an icon on the new, populist right, especially among young conservatives, and a key ally of Trump. While some conservatives called for calm, others, such as conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and podcaster and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, called for “war.”

In a speech on the House floor on Thursday, Rep. Mary Miller, an Illinois Republican, said Kirk's “death was not an isolated tragedy. It is part of a disturbing trend in political violence in our country, encouraged by the radical left and amplified by a corrupt media that has gone from being fake to totally evil.”

Many prominent Democrats issued statements urging calm on both sides. Among them were California Gov. Gavin Newsom and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose husband was gravely injured by a hammer-wielding attacker who broke into their house in 2022 in an assault that Trump, among other Republicans, mocked.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, also called for lowering the temperature across the board.

Still, the most prominent practitioner of polarized attacks remains Trump. Friday morning, shortly after announcing the arrest on Fox News, he said “the radicals on the right oftentimes are radical because they don't want to see crime. ... The radicals on the left are the problem.”

The Anti-Defamation League found that from 2022 through 2024, all of the 61 political killings in the U.S. were committed by right-wing extremists. That changed on the first day of 2025, when a Texas man flying the flag of the Islamic State group killed 14 people by driving his truck through a crowded New Orleans street before being fatally shot by police.

Hoffman said that in modern history, the right has been responsible for more political attacks on people than the left. He said that's because left-wing radicals are more likely to target property rather than people, and because the extreme right boasts organizations such as militias.

He added that after Trump pardoned more than 1,500 people convicted of crimes during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol to overturn his election loss, “there's a belief in certain quarters that, if you engage in violence, the slate can be wiped clean.”

There's no question there's also been political violence from the left. In 2017, a 66-year-old man who had supported leftist causes opened fire at a congressional Republican baseball practice, critically wounding Rep. Steve Scalise, who eventually recovered.

In 2022, an armed man angry over a leaked ruling from an coming case that would limit abortion rights tried to enter the home of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The man backed off when he saw U.S. Marshals guarding the justice's house, called his sister, and was persuaded to call 911 and surrender to police.

Pape, of the University of Chicago, said those who engage in political violence are often not the same as the partisans who stoke debates online. He said about 40% of those who perpetrate political violence have a mental illness.

“When there is strong support in the public for political violence, that nudges people over the edge because they think they're acting in community interest,” he said.

He said he worried about Trump's one-sided condemnation of left-wing violence, saying it will only inflame the conflict. He compared it to when some liberals condemn all Trump voters as racists.

“The constituents of whoever is doing this, it emboldens them,” Pape said. As for the group being tarnished as uniquely violent, “it creates a bigger sense of defiance,” he added. “What we need to do is convince Trump to do more restraining of his side because we're really in a tinderbox moment.”

Independent journalist Evita Duffy-Alfonso joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss the backlash that those mourning Charlie Kirk on social media are receiving and where it is stemming from.

A New Jersey nurse who reported a doctor who allegedly ""cheered and celebrated"" Charlie Kirk's assassination is suing after she faced disciplanry action, her lawyer said in a lawsuit filed on Friday. 

Lexi Kuenzle, 33, a nurse at Englewood Health, filed suit Friday against the hospital, Dr. Matthew Jung and others for the incident that allegedly occurred ""in front of patients and staff."" 

""She had the audacity to question how Dr. Jung can comply with the Hippocratic Oath's and the American Medical Association's Code of Medical Ethics while celebrating the murder of a non-violent Christian speaker who was on a college campus,"" Kuenzle's attorney, John Coyle, said in the complaint.

Dr. Jung then allegedly ""offered to ‘buy lunch' for the nursing staff that he offended,"" the lawsuit states.

Kuenzle reported Wednesday's incident to management and posted about it on social media when she got home, she told the New York Post.

""You're a doctor. How could you say someone deserved to die?"" she recalled saying in response. ""It was mind-blowing to me. I was so angry and upset.""

Following her complaint, the nurse claimed she was suspended without pay while an investigation took place. The lawsuit alleges that she was later told she would be fired.

The hospital told Fox News Digital it is aware of the incident, and that ""both the doctor and nurse were placed on suspension to allow time for a thorough and fair investigation, following our standard protocol, and in the interest of everyone's safety including their own.""

""Contrary to certain media reports, the nurse was not fired. Any reported suggestions that the nurse should seek other employment was not an official or accurate statement from Englewood Health,"" the statement from Englewood Health said.

The lawsuit filed by Coyle on behalf of Kuenzle claims the hospital violated the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination due to their knowledge of Kuenzle's Christian faith, retaliated against her, violated the Conscientious Employee Protection Act and created a hostile work environment. Kuenzle is demanding a jury trial, and is seeking unspecified monetary damages.

Cleveland Browns legend Joe Thomas is giving the ""Shedeur Sanders cult"" a reality check in his appearance on OutKick's ""Don't @ Me with Dan Dakich.""

Shedeur Sanders reportedly made an effort to avoid being selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the 2025 NFL Draft.

The Ravens had plans to take the former Colorado Buffaloes standout quarterback with the 141st pick of the draft, ESPN reported Sunday. However, Sanders reportedly made it known that he didn't want to get stuck behind two-time NFL MVP Lamar Jackson on the depth chart.

Sanders was looking to be chosen by a team in which he would have a chance to play. The Ravens ended up taking offensive lineman Carson Vinson and Sanders went to the Cleveland Browns a few picks later.

He would have been in a battle with Cooper Rush and Devin Leary for the backup job. Rush joined the Ravens from the Dallas Cowboys in the offseason. Leary was signed to a futures contract in January but didn't make the final roster.

66-year-old LSU freshman Kent Broussard opens up on 'America Reports' on his journey to becoming a student marching band member, fulfilling a dream that began in 1968.

LSU Tigers head coach Brian Kelly got swept up in skirmish between one of his players and a defender on the Florida Gators on Saturday night in their 20-10 victory.

Kelly was running down the sideline to call a timeout after an LSU play in the second quarter. As he was moving toward the official, LSU offensive lineman Weston Davis and Florida linebacker George Gumbs Jr. were still locked together. Davis was pushing Gumbs to the sideline and they knocked into Kelly.

The veteran head coach appeared to be OK and would stick around to watch the Tigers pick up the win.

Tigers quarterback Garrett Nussmeier had 220 passing yards, a touchdown pass and an interception. Caden Durham had 93 rushing yards on 15 carries.

LSU's defense held Florida scoreless in the second half. Three of Gators quarterback DJ Lagway's interceptions came in the second half.

Fox News contributor Paul Mauro breaks down what is ahead for Tyler Robinson, the suspect in the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk.

Law enforcement officials arrested the man accused of shooting and killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah on Friday after a frantic 33-hour manhunt. The suspect's fate now hinges on whether the state pursues capital charges as political pressure mounts.

Prosecutors have not yet filed charges against Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of killing Kirk after driving nearly four hours to Utah Valley University, where the longtime Trump ally was speaking. It also remains unclear whether they will seek the death penalty, a step publicly urged by both President Donald Trump and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox. 

At a Friday news conference, Cox said investigators used surveillance footage from the stadium and tips from Robinson's family and friends to identify him before the arrest. He also said charges would be filed ""soon."" 

""We got him,"" Cox said. 

'THIS IS ON ALL OF US': LAWMAKERS TAKE HARD LOOK AT HOW POLITICAL RHETORIC PLAYED ROLE IN KIRK'S ASSASSINATION

The governor vowed that Robinson would be ""held accountable"" for Kirk's death, which he called a ""political assassination.""

""This is certainly about the tragic death, assassination, political assassination of Charlie Kirk, but it is also much bigger than an attack on an individual,"" Cox said. ""It is an attack on all of us. It is an attack on the American experiment."" 

Kirk's graphic death and the scant public information revealed in its wake have left the nation reeling and revived heated debate about political violence in the U.S. It's also sparked a litany of questions about how prosecutors will bring the case against Robinson, with Utah law and years of precedent making capital punishment difficult to pursue. 

ENGRAVINGS ON SHOOTER'S AMMO EXPOSES CHARLIE KIRK ASSASSINATION MOTIVE

Robinson is being held at Utah County Jail. A probable cause affidavit reviewed by Fox News Digital lists potential charges including aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious injury and obstruction of justice.

Utah law allows prosecutors to seek the death penalty only in cases where an individual is charged with ""aggravated murder"" — or a murder that knowingly ""created a great risk of death"" to another person besides the victim or defendant. The offense is listed in the affidavit, which could open the door for prosecutors to seek the death penalty. 

The clock is ticking: Utah law requires state prosecutors to file a specific notice of intent within 60 days after an individual is arraigned on aggravated murder charges to notify the court and defense attorneys that they plan to try the case as a capital felony. Doing so sets into motion a complex legal process — including a two-part, or bifurcated trial, to decide both guilt and whether the defendant should receive capital punishment. 

Otherwise, the case is tried under charges of a ""noncapitalist fist-degree penalty,"" eligible for a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole.

Cox and Trump both suggested in interviews earlier this week that the state should seek the death penalty against Kirk's killer, even before Robinson was named as a suspect. 

""I hope he gets the death penalty,"" Trump said Friday morning on ""Fox & Friends,"" calling Kirk ""the finest person."" 

The Beehive State is one of 27 states that still allows the death penalty, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. It's also one of just five states where execution by firing squad remains legal.

Even so, capital punishment cases are rarely pursued in Utah. The state has carried out only two executions in the past 20 years, and inmates spend an average of 34 years on death row.

Only four men are currently on death row in Utah, each for ""decades,"" according to KUTV.  

For Robinson, whose criminal trial will draw national attention, particularly from the president and his allies, it's still far too early to predict the outcome.

Already, Robinson's case has fueled intense speculation — even as some lawmakers urged calm.

""History will dictate if this is a turning point for our country,"" Cox said, ""but every single one of us gets to choose right now if this is a turning point for us.""

Fox News host Sean Hannity praises Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirks widow Erika Kirks powerful address to the nation on Hannity.

A debate is raging among Wikipedia editors over whether to delete the profile page of Erika Kirk, wife of slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Her Wikipedia entry is currently locked, with users unable to make changes as editor nominators argue she fails the site's notability standard and lacks significant independent coverage.

Erika did not have a standalone Wikipedia page before her husband's death. Editors noted the article was created on Thursday in the immediate aftermath of the killing.

CHARLIE KIRK HONORED AS 'GENERATION'S GREATEST' AT MASSIVE LONDON RALLY WHERE MUSK CONDEMNS LEFT

While Erika did not have a major public profile beforehand, she has been thrust into the national spotlight since Wednesday's tragedy. Her emotional and defiant speech Friday night drew millions of viewers worldwide, and several major outlets have since profiled her.

In the speech, she vowed that Turning Point USA would continue its campus tour this fall. Her husband co-founded the conservative advocacy group in 2012.

YOUTH LEADERS MOURN 'THE GODFATHER OF CAMPUS CONSERVATISM' CHARLIE KIRK FOLLOWING ASSASSINATION

One nominator, an editor using the handle ""Epluribusunumyall,"" wrote in the Articles for Deletion (AfD) thread that the profile should be pulled.

""Article was created in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's killing yesterday, but coverage otherwise is either limited in nature (i.e., her participation in beauty pageants) or inherited from her husband,"" the user wrote.

Another editor backed up that viewpoint, saying Erika isn't notable apart from being married to Charlie.

Many of the delete arguments rely on core Wikipedia policy, saying Erika does not meet general notability guidelines, lacks significant independent coverage, and should not inherit notoriety from her husband.

COMPLETE COVERAGE OF CHARLIE KIRK

Wikipedia, which allows anyone to edit its articles, often locks high-profile or disputed pages during heated debates. The entry is currently locked until Sept. 18.

However, the majority of those weighing in have argued that her profile should be kept, writing that there is significant public interest in her now due to current headlines.

""Wikipedia looks ridiculous with a banner on top noting that this topic is being targeted for deletion,"" one user wrote. ""And it can't be edited until Sept. 18? Again, ridiculous. She gave a speech Friday night, two nights after the murder (covered live only by FOX) in which she forcefully declared her intentions to take the TPUSA movement forward. The clamps need to be removed.""

Another echoed those sentiments.

""This is ridiculous nitpicking. She is NOW notable, so she should now be included in Wiki,"" the user wrote. ""There are plenty of people highlighted in Wiki that are far from ‘notable' as many would define it.""

Many keep votes are driven by current public interest and her Miss Arizona win in 2012 — arguments sometimes seen as weaker under policy.

Although the keep votes are in the majority, the decision will ultimately hinge on whether administrators believe there's enough independent, significant coverage to meet the bar. Policy-heavy delete rationales carry weight.

Fox News Digital reached out to Wikipedia for comment but did not receive a response in time for publication. 

Wikipedia has often been criticized for leaning left. In 2022, Elon Musk slammed the site for contemplating removing its entry on the ""Twitter Files"" investigation, while in 2020 the platform locked down a page on Hunter Biden's laptop.

Urban Meyer joins Colin Cowherd to discuss the panic over Arch Manning, Alabama's opening day loss, and Bill Belichick and UNC's ""shocking"" loss to TCU on opening night.

Texas Longhorns quarterback Arch Manning heard the frustrations from fans on Saturday during the team's 27-10 win over the UTEP Miners.

Manning's inefficiency was on full display, and the Longhorns faithful grew tired of it during the first half. They were heard booing the team despite the victory.

Manning was 11-of-25 with 114 passing yards, a touchdown pass and an interception. He had 51 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns.

He told reporters after the game he knew he had to play better.

""I've got to play better,"" he said, via ESPN. ""A lot of quarterbacks -- a lot of players -- want to be great. I know I'm better than this.""

While the offense had 23 first downs in the game, the Longhorns were only 5-of-16 on third down and 2-of-5 on fourth down.

Still, Texas wide receiver Ryan Wingo expressed his support in the highly touted quarterback.

""Arch is a great quarterback. The same great quarterback,"" Wingo said, via On3 Sports. ""Our chemistry isn't down. I think it's improving, especially later in the game, like everyone else in the country.""

Manning has not lived up to the wild expectations that were set for him before the season started. However, Texas has gotten into the win column in back-to-back weeks and the team only lost to Ohio State by a touchdown.

Mexico has made thousands of arrests and seized tens of thousands of pounds of illegal drugs, numbers that its embassy is emphasizing as President Donald Trump pressures the country to step up its border crackdown.

Since Trump levied 25% tariffs on Mexico in February, citing cross-border crime, Mexico has sought to highlight its cooperation with the United States, and on Friday shared statistics on how it has addressed the smuggling of narcotics and migrants into the country.

The Mexican government has arrested more than 7,100 suspects since early February, the embassy reported, as well as seized 5,541 guns and 980,000 rounds of ammunition; taken custody of 4,768 vehicles and 861 properties; and interdicted 208,000 pounds of drugs, including 850 pounds of fentanyl.

“Mexico's Security Cabinet continues to deliver consistent results in the fight against organized crime through Operation Northern Border. During the period reported, coordinated actions led to major arrests, seizures of firearms, ammunition, narcotics, vehicles, and dismantling of synthetic drug facilities,” the Mexican Embassy said in a statement.

White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said the seizures are the result of the country's ongoing nationwide crackdown on cartels, with the State Department announcing in September additional security cooperation to target organized crime.

“President Trump has followed through on his promises to secure the southern border and end the flow of illicit drugs into our homeland,” Kelly said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “His successful strategy includes coordinating with the Mexican government to root out corruption and resolve security issues that threaten American citizens.”

On Feb. 1, Trump issued an executive order that threatened to institute a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico. Hours before the tariffs were set to go into place, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she would work with the White House to address border security and crime. Trump ended up imposing the 25% tariffs, but he has held back from higher duties as the two countries negotiate a trade deal.

The crackdown is part of Sheinbaum's pledge to stop drugs and people from being smuggled to the U.S. Since Trump took office, the number of people illegally crossing the border has dropped from the spike under President Joe Biden to 60-year lows since February.

In Mexico's Sinaloa state, where the Sinaloa Cartel has a stronghold, police and the military have dismantled four synthetic drug storage facilities and $63 million worth of methamphetamine and its precursor ingredients.

In Chihuahua, authorities seized six improvised explosive devices, while officials in the Sonoran state seized more than 200 packages of marijuana and 124 packages of meth.

The Mexican Embassy did not provide details on how the seizures and arrests compare to previous periods in national records.

Simon Hankinson, senior research fellow in the border security and immigration center at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, said statistics without historical context make it difficult to know the significance of the seizures.

“What is the number of journalists who got killed this month compared to a year ago? Are there any reductions in the metrics that indicate that the Mexican government is gaining control over territory, or is this just an attempt to make it look like they're making an effort to the Trump administration, which is not to say that they're not making an effort, but is it actually making a difference in the amount of drugs coming into the U.S., the amount of Americans dying of drug overdoses, you know, things that really matter?” said Hankinson, who works for a conservative think tank.

UTAH GOV. SPENCER COX SAYS ASSASSINATION OF CHARLIE KIRK ‘AN ATTACK ON ALL' AMERICANS

In relative terms, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the federal agency that inspects people and goods at all U.S. border crossings and ports of entry, seized 573,000 pounds of drugs, including nearly 22,000 pounds of fentanyl, in fiscal 2024. The large majority of Mexico's drug seizures were not fentanyl.

A California bill that would allow the state to fine large social media companies millions of dollars if they amplify violent or extremist content has ignited a free speech fight, pitting Big Tech against those who argue more accountability is needed. 

The state legislature, in which Democrats hold a supermajority, passed California Senate Bill 771 Thursday night and is headed to Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D-CA) desk. He has until Oct. 13 to sign it. If he does, it could create a messy, drawn-out legal battle with multibillion-dollar tech companies over what people can post on their platforms.

The bill, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Henry Stern, was introduced after X and Meta loosened content moderation and scaled back fact-checking following criticism from President Donald Trump and other Republicans who argued such policies infringed on conservatives' rights.

Opponents warn that SB771 is a sweeping censorship bill disguised as protection against hate and bigotry and that it threatens the rights of anyone who advocates for beliefs that challenge dominant narratives. Supporters of the bill claim it is much-needed protection against groups that have been given space on social media to spew hateful rhetoric.

According to the bill, large social media companies will be subject to legal challenges and fines if their algorithms “relay content to users” that violates the state's civil rights protections, such as hate speech. Platforms knowingly violating the law could face fines up to $1 million. The bill would also implement a separate “civil penalty” fine of up to $500,000 for reckless violations. Fines double in cases involving minors. 

A fact sheet provided to the Washington Examiner by Stern's office claimed violence, threats, and intimidation targeting certain historically vulnerable populations, such as Jewish people, women, immigrants, people of color, and those in the LGBT community, are at “historic highs and rising at record-shattering rates.” His office cited a recent study from Harvard that found a causal relationship between widespread violence against historically targeted groups and the practices of social media platforms.

“Notwithstanding the escalating danger, social media platforms have announced dramatic retreats in screening and moderation practices to protect targeted populations,” Stern's office claimed. “This change could not have come at a more dangerous time for groups that are historically targeted.… This is a national trend that is accelerating.”

Vladislav Khaykin, executive vice president at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Los Angeles-based Jewish human rights activist organization, supports the bill. 

“In an era when much of our public life unfolds online, the digital world has become a battleground for the very soul of our society,” he said. “Yet the tech companies that control this space are failing us, and the cost of their failure is measured not just in misinformation and division, but also — increasingly — lost lives.”

INTERNET DETECTIVES START DISINFORMATION FRENZY AFTER NAMING WRONG PERSON IN CHARLIE KIRK KILLING

Khaykin, who testified before the California State Assembly in support of SB771, called it a “critical step toward finally holding tech companies accountable for amplifying hate, extremism and disinformation.”

The Simon Wiesenthal Center publishes an annual Digital Terror and Hate Report Card, which assesses how major tech and social media companies handle extremism, harassment, and questionable content on their sites.

“Our latest report paints a dire picture: Most major platforms, including Facebook, X, TikTok, YouTube, Amazon Music and Truth Social, received failing or near-failing grades — Ds and Fs dominate,” Khaykin said. “This failure underscores a hard truth: self-regulation is no regulation at all. Voluntary measures are no match for profit-driven algorithms that thrive on outrage, hate and division.”

Khaykin believes Stern's bill addressed the problem with “clarity and purpose” and said SB771 “ensures that California's civil rights protections against hate crimes, harassment and intimidation apply equally to the digital world, especially when algorithms purposefully amplify harmful content. It empowers victims to seek meaningful recourse and imposes penalties scaled to a platform's size and revenue, making enforcement real — not symbolic. This means that larger platforms, which have a greater impact, will face more severe penalties if they fail to uphold the standards set by Stern's legislation.”

Critics of the bill call it nothing short of government-sponsored censorship.

Computer & Communications Industry Association, which represents tech giants such as Google, Amazon, and Meta, testified against the bill, arguing that it weakens free speech online and violates First Amendment protections. 

“It's essential that we protect users online, but SB 771 is not the right approach,” said Aodhan Downey, state policy manager for CCIA. “By exposing platforms to vague and costly lawsuits, this bill would force services to become overly cautious and err on the side of censorship — removing far more speech than necessary and restricting legitimate conversations, all to avoid unfounded litigation. This risks undermining free expression, conflicts with federal law, and ultimately would make the online environment less open and less trustworthy. We urge the Assembly to reject this flawed measure and pursue balanced, effective solutions that will truly protect users while upholding constitutional rights and an open internet.”

The California chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation's largest Muslim civil rights organization, also took issue with the bill, warning it could be weaponized to suppress protected speech and disproportionately affect marginalized communities, including Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian Californians.

“This bill opens the door for bad actors to disproportionately pressure online corporations into silencing free speech to reduce their financial liability, with no protections for users against those mechanisms,” Oussama Mokeddem, CAIR-CA legislative and government affairs director, said. “It does nothing to address the actual drivers of anti-black racism, Islamophobia, and white supremacist violence. Instead, it risks chilling dissenting voices—particularly those advocating for Palestinian human rights—under the guise of combating hate.”

Shoshana Weissmann, director of digital media at the R Street Institute, told Reason Magazine that the bill would unfairly punish social media companies for speech protected under the First Amendment. 

“This bill includes algorithms where new posts are shown first or posts shown are only from the people one follows, without further customization,” she said. “Under this bill, any form of showing content to users would make the companies liable for user speech. This obviously makes no sense.” 

She said the bill also has not defined how social media companies can “knowingly promote hate.”

ANTIFASCIST SAYINGS WRITTEN ON KIRK SHOOTER'S BULLET CASINGS: ‘BELLA CIAO'

“Under the law, ‘knowingly' seems to include anytime the platform uses an algorithm,” she said.  

By only penalizing companies with $100 million or more in annual gross profits, the bill could have the opposite effect and send users to smaller social media platforms like 4chan, which has a reputation for allowing more extreme views and content, Weissmann said.

Rep. Dave Min (D-CA) was slammed on Saturday after he falsely claimed the suspect in Charlie Kirk‘s assassination was “MAGA” and part of what he dubbed the “RADICAL RIGHT.”

Min made the bizarre claim on Friday, the day officials arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson as the suspect in the killing of Kirk. Gov. Spencer Cox (R-UT) has said it is “very clear” Robinson was “deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology,” and one family member interviewed by officials said Robinson openly talked about his belief that Kirk was “full of hate and spreading hate.”

Still, Min has kept his post up on X as of Saturday night, which says, “Now that the Charlie Kirk assassin has been identified as MAGA, I'm sure Donald Trump, Elon Musk and all the insane GOP politicians who called for retribution against the ‘RADICAL LEFT' will now shift their focus to stopping the toxic violence of the RADICAL RIGHT.”

Min was quickly trashed by Republicans, including the National Republican Congressional Committee, which called the California Democrat “unhinged, drunk, and disgraceful.”

“Unhinged conspiracy theorist Dave Min is spewing lies and exploiting a tragedy to score cheap political points. Besides being a drunk, Min is reckless, disgraceful, and a pathetic excuse for a Congressman who will say anything to distract from his own failures. Californians deserve better,” NRCC spokesman Christian Martinez said in a statement on Saturday.

Harmeet Dhillon, who serves in the civil rights division at the Department of Justice, also blasted Min.

“You are a foul liar, and a reprehensible person,” Dhillon posted on X alongside Min's statement.

Despite Min's claim, recent reporting has indicated that investigators are looking into the other side of the political spectrum as they dig for a motive.

According to Axios, officials are investigating whether Robinson believed Kirk's views on gender identity were “hateful,” after it was revealed on Saturday that Robinson's roommate identifies as transgender.

They are also looking into left-wing groups in Utah, where Kirk was shot and killed while speaking at a college event, to see if they had any knowledge of Robinson's plans or if they gave him material support after.

Future generations will regard with shock and wonder decisions by Democratic states about questions raised by the interaction of transgender ideology, religious freedom, and the First Amendment.

Massachusetts authorities are threatening to remove children from even stable foster parents who refuse to sign agreements to “promote,” “support,” and “affirm” a child's gender identity or expression. The Massachusetts Department of Children and Families implemented this requirement in 2023, demanding that parents speak and act in ways that affirm a foster child's sexual orientation or gender identity at the threat of having the children taken back to state custody.

EDITORIAL: WHAT THE MURDER OF CHARLIE KIRK MEANS

Early this month, two families, the Joneses and the Schrocks, sued to challenge the policy on the grounds that it violates proper protection of their religious beliefs. The families are Christian and say they have either lost or are at risk of losing their licenses. According to the lawsuit, Massachusetts plans to remove a 17-month-old baby whom the Joneses have raised since the baby was 2 months old. The Schrocks had their license revoked this summer after telling the state they would not affirm the gender identity of their child.

At any moment in the United States, some 400,000 children are in the foster care system, including 8,000-9,000 in Massachusetts in roughly 5,500 available homes. The gender affirmation requirement would shrink that number considerably because religious households are more likely than members of the general population to become foster parents. A 2024 Bipartisan Policy Center and Harris Poll study found that 65% of foster parents attend church services weekly, compared to under 40% of the general U.S. population. A 2013 Barna Research study shows that practicing Christians are twice as likely to foster or adopt as the general population. They are also more likely to foster sibling groups, older youth, and children with special needs.

This is no mere coincidence. People motivated by faith, perhaps especially Christianity, view caring for vulnerable children as part of their religious commitment. They not only provide shelter and food for children but also moral grounding and emotional support.

Actively and deliberately reducing the number of stable and decent homes for foster children is a travesty, especially when it is being done to satisfy the demands of a radical and discredited ideology that masquerades as science and demands complicity.

In addition to being foolish and harmful to children, the gender affirmation requirement is a direct assault on religious freedom and the First Amendment. Massachusetts forces parents to renounce core Christian beliefs if they wish to retain their licenses, violating free exercise and free speech rights. The policy forces foster parents to adopt a leftist ideological view, which violates the First Amendment's protection against compelled speech. The Supreme Court has consistently struck down such mandates and did so as recently as 2023 in 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, which protected a Christian web designer from creating content against her faith.

DEMOCRATS MUM ON GUN CONTROL BUT CONDEMN POLITICAL VIOLENCE AFTER CHARLIE KIRK ASSASSINATION

The gender affirmation regulation also infringes on the Free Exercise Clause by making foster care conditional on abandoning religious convictions. In Fulton v. City of Philadelphia (2021), the court unanimously ruled that Philadelphia could not exclude a Catholic foster agency for refusing to certify same-sex couples, citing religious freedom protections.

By forcing Christian families, which comprise the backbone of the foster care system, to renounce their faith to participate, Massachusetts sacrifices vulnerable children and illegally discriminates against Christian families. What else should we expect in blue-state America?","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Hunter Biden filed a motion on Saturday calling for the arrest of former Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne amid a defamation lawsuit for which Byrne has not appeared in court.

Biden's attorneys filed the motion for a bench warrant Saturday, roughly two years after Biden filed suit against Byrne. This most recent filing alleges that Byrne has refused to provide a physical address or email address, so Biden's attorneys have been unable to contact Byrne in order to complete the discovery process in the case.

“Defendant is a billionaire who ignores court orders while concealing his assets overseas or in cryptocurrencies specifically created to evade governmental authority and who flouts this Court's authority,” the motion read.

“The appropriate sanction is to force Defendant to appear and defend (or confess) the case on the merits. The Court has repeatedly ordered Defendant to appear, and Defendant has repeatedly ignored the Court,” the motion continued.

A bench warrant would require Byrne to appear in court in order to avoid arrest.

This case centers on an interview Byrne gave to the Capitol Times Magazine, in which he alleges that he visited the Middle East in 2021. Byrne claimed he was made aware of Biden allegedly meddling in Iranian affairs, but did not cite a source.

“Hunter Biden was reaching out to the Iranian government in the fall of 2021 with the following offer: You Iranians have $8 billion frozen in a bank account in South Korea. My father will unfreeze it in return for $800 million being funneled into a numbered account for us,” Byrne is quoted in the article.

Biden referred to the allegations as “false and defamatory statements” in the lawsuit. Since then, Byrne has continued to post about the case on X.

“Hi Hunter. I understand [I] am going to be deposing you in about three weeks? Hoorah!” Byrne wrote in July. “Wait until you see what I have on you. Let us see how much more prison time I can get you.”

Hi Hunter. I understand  am going to be deposing you in about three weeks? Hoorah! Wait until you see what I have on you. Let us see how much more prison time I can get you. https://t.co/bxhFYeUNyu

However, the trial has yet to begin, as Byrne has fired counsel, and so has Biden. Byrne was deposed by Abbe Lowell, the attorney Biden hired during his special counsel investigation and gun charges in Wilmington, Delaware. Since then, Biden fired Lowell and replaced him with Richard Harpootlian, who previously represented convicted killer Alex Murdaugh.

Byrne is also in the middle of a lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems, which is accusing the former CEO of allegedly manufacturing and promoting false evidence claiming that Dominion machines were rigged to manipulate the results of the 2020 election. The litigation has been going on for four years.

In August 2019, Byrne resigned as CEO of Overstock after his comments about the “deep state” involved in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A poem

For Joe Minter, the African Village in America, and 1504

And when those white-sailed ships piled us together, cargo in the hull of hell, the word rode with us, our tongues anointed with the power of God. When the lash found our language, when they said don't read or write, our tongues were still gilded with a heavenly word. We still sang that holy song, even in this strange land. Even here, God spoke to us and through us. Our hands made language and earth became fruitful, and song became prayer, and a people made do with the bones and scraps of america.

And we became messengers with each sin pitched against us— in Birmingham, there was God in the feet of the marchers and in the starched collar of Fred Shuttlesworth, in the curls and dimples of those four girls, in the boyish joy of Virgil and Johnny before their song was cut short.

Messengers, all of us, speaking the word God left us in this weary land. Messengers with the word as their spear, messengers speaking life into each brick, each crop, each stitch, each book we made.

And there is a messenger on Nassau Avenue with the word clear and strong on his tongue, a warrior for the Lord, a servant of the word. And the ancestors find his brown hands and anoint them, and metal becomes message; wood and paint interpret scripture, the wind blows through, and there is God.

In the beginning there was the word, and the word remains. We are a living tongue— the word is a torch and we tote it proudly, what you hear is our collective soul, what you see is love walking, God's blueprint, ours is an unstoppable song.

This poem is from Ashley M. Jones's new book, Lullaby for the Grieving.

﻿The paradox of moral perfectionism — and how to escape it.

Your Mileage May Vary is an advice column offering you a unique framework for thinking through your moral dilemmas. It's based on value pluralism — the idea that each of us has multiple values that are equally valid but that often conflict with each other. To submit a question, fill out this anonymous form. Here's this week's question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity:

The Jewish High Holidays are coming up, and that includes Yom Kippur. It's a holiday that encourages people to reflect on their behavior and make amends. That's all well and good, but I'm someone who struggles with scrupulosity — constantly worrying about my morality and if I'm doing The Most Possible Good™.

In practice this is far more paralyzing than motivating. Fixating on the ethical implications of all possible decisions makes it harder to take any action, and I've lost hours scouring my memories of my past behavior for immorality like a football player watching footage of their games to analyze what they could do differently. Guilt simply isn't serving me, but I worry that saying to hell with all that means I'll stop striving to be a better person and become morally complacent.

I've observed Yom Kippur for decades, and don't want to simply avoid the day. But the holiday is a moral scrupulosity trigger. How do you think I should approach this? I want to stop feeling guilty for letting guilt get in my own way.

Dear Scrupulous,

Have you ever heard the story about what happened when God decided to give the Bible to flesh-and-blood human beings? According to the ancient rabbis, the angels hated the idea. They argued that humans were deeply flawed mortals who didn't deserve such a holy scripture; only angels could be worthy of it, so it should stay up in heaven.

It fell to Moses to rebut the angels' argument. He asked them: What do you angels need the Bible for? The Bible says not to murder, not to commit adultery, not to steal — do you have jealousy or other emotions that could lead you to do those things? The Bible says to honor your father and mother — but you don't have parents, so how could you ever do that? And the Bible says to sanctify the Sabbath — but you never do any work, so how could you even honor the Sabbath by resting?

The angels saw that Moses was right. Angels are really great at one thing: being perfect. But perfect creatures are static. They don't experience painful challenges, they don't grow, and they don't make choices that add beauty to the world. We humans do those things. God gives the Bible to humans not to make them into angels — but to make them better at being the unique thing they are: human animals, with feelings, flaws, and all, that can learn to use their capabilities in more beautiful ways.

I think there's a lot of wisdom in this story. And I want you to notice how far it is from demanding that humans do “The Most Possible Good™.” That language suggests a maximizing ethical theory like utilitarianism, which says that we have to do the action that produces the greatest good for the greatest number. In other words, we have to optimize.

Moral optimization may be possible for angels, but not for humans. We each hold multiple values, and sometimes those values are in tension with each other, forcing us to strike a balance as best we can. We're not omniscient beings who can know with certainty how best to strike the balance.

What's more, sometimes different kinds of moral good straight-up conflict with each other. Think of a woman who faces a trade-off: She wants to become a nun but also wants to become a mother. She can't balance between those options — she has to choose. And what's the better choice? We can't say because the options are incommensurable. There's no single yardstick by which to measure them so we can't compare them to find out which is greater.

Given that this complexity is baked into the human condition, it's impossible to be a perfect optimizing machine. And the more you try to force yourself to be that, the harder it'll be for you to actually help others, because you'll just be so burned out. As you've already discovered, the optimizing mindset is exhausting — you end up expending a lot of precious mental resources that you could be spending on something else. It can even lead to paralysis. And a lot of the time, there's no knowably best decision.

So instead of trying to optimize everything, you can adopt a goal that's humbler but more realistic: to live in line with your values as best you can.

I know that can feel scary. Optimizing makes being human feel less risky. It provides a sense of control, and therefore a sense of safety. The unspoken premise is that if you optimize, you'll never have to ask yourself: How could I screw up that badly?

But there's another way to feel safe. It's about leaning into the fact that we are imperfect and vulnerable creatures and that even when we're trying our hardest there will be some things that we do not do optimally.

Of course, we should still try to live in line with our values. But in those moments when we fall short, we shouldn't berate ourselves, thinking, “I sinned!” In Hebrew, the word we typically translate as “to sin” (lachto) actually means “to miss the mark.” It's the same word we'd use to describe someone with a bow and arrow who's targeting the bullseye but misses it slightly. This is a useful image, because it reminds us just how normal it is to miss the mark. Just as the archer's arrow is buffeted around by the wind, we're buffeted around by all the physical and psychological conditions acting upon us — naturally we won't always hit the bullseye! And when we do miss the mark, we deserve compassion.

I know what you're thinking: What if adopting this mindset means you'll become morally complacent and let yourself off the hook too easily? This is one of the most common objections to practicing self-compassion. But research shows it's not well-founded. In fact, psychologists have found that more self-compassionate people are better able to acknowledge when they've made a mistake. They're more likely to want to apologize and make amends to others when they mess up. And they try to do better the next time around. Why? Because, to them, mistakes don't feel so psychologically damning. That allows them to take more — not less — responsibility for their actions.

Yom Kippur can feel terrifying when any mistake you've made over the past year seems damning. But according to the ancient rabbis, Yom Kippur is not meant to be a somber day — it's one of the happiest days of the year! After all, it was on Yom Kippur that Moses descended from Mount Sinai carrying the second set of tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments, ready to gift them to the people.

You probably know what happened to the first set of tablets: Moses shattered them after seeing the Israelites engaged in idol worship. What's less known is that, according to one rabbinic story, God's response to the shattering of those tablets was to actually congratulate Moses. Why did God think breaking them was the right move? And what was different about the second set?

While the first tablets had been fashioned by God and God alone, the second tablets were a human-divine collaboration: Moses carved the stone and God inscribed the words. And while the first tablets contained only the words of the Ten Commandments — a black-and-white, rule-based morality — the rabbis tell us that the second tablets contained within them all the stories and interpretations that Jewish sages would later develop.

In other words, God recognized that you can't just give humans a list of moral rules and call it a day. Maybe that would work for angels, who live in a simplified, disembodied world, but our ethical life is just too messy and multifaceted to be captured by any single set of universally binding moral principles. Yet God chose people over angels anyway, inviting us into the collaboration and embracing our humanness rather than rejecting it.

So, to the rabbis, Yom Kippur was a happy day because they fully expected that God would accept and embrace messy humans.

Please, don't try to be more zealous than God.

When you're taking action, by all means, aim your arrows as true as you can — try to hit the bullseye, the place that captures as much of what you value as possible. But once you've released the arrow from your bow, let it be.

If it turns out that you missed the mark, that you acted suboptimally, I put it to you that that is okay. You are not an angel. You are not a perfect optimizing machine. You do not have access to a magical mathematical formula that can consider countless incommensurable variables and spit out the very best move with certainty. You are human and you do the best you can with what you've got.

The wisdom of these millennia-old stories is that that's good enough for God. Let it be good enough for you, too.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Companies from Delta to Office Depot are disciplining employees for their public comments on Charlie Kirk's death","https://www.businessinsider.com/charlie-kirk-microsoft-nasdaq-delta-office-depot-employees-public-comments-2025-9","Sun, 14 Sep 2025 01:15:00 GMT","

In the days since Charlie Kirk's death, some companies have been forced to navigate a delicate situation: employees sharing their personal views about the conservative activist in public.

For employers, those remarks highlight the growing challenge of balancing free expression with corporate values and workplace harmony.

Major corporations like Microsoft and Delta Air Lines are taking action against employees who have made social media posts critical of Kirk's own views, or even ones celebrating his death, which could be considered a violation of company values.

Kirk, an ally of President Donald Trump, advocated conservative beliefs on college campuses and was influential among young people on the right. However, many find his comments about immigrants, trans rights, and feminism intolerant and divisive.

Here is how some companies are responding.

Microsoft shared an X post on Friday addressing negative remarks about Kirk made online by some of its employees.

""We're aware of the views expressed by a small subset of our employees regarding recent events,"" the company said. ""We take matters like this very seriously and we are currently reviewing each individual situation.""

Microsoft said, ""Comments celebrating violence against anyone are unacceptable and do not align with our values.""

Microsoft's statement came after Tesla CEO Elon Musk called out Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on X in response to an unverified claim that some employees at Blizzard, a video game company owned by Microsoft, had posted comments ""trashing"" Kirk.

The ODP Corporation, parent company of Office Depot, apologized to consumers on Friday after footage taken at a Michigan Office Depot gained attention on social media. The footage appeared to show an employee refusing to print a poster for a vigil associated with Kirk.

""The behavior displayed by our associate is completely unacceptable and insensitive, violates our company policies, and does not reflect the values we uphold at Office Depot. On behalf of the Company, we sincerely apologize for this regrettable situation,"" the company said in a press release.

The company said it fired the employee involved in the interaction.

""We also launched an immediate internal review and, as a result, the associate involved is no longer with the organization,"" the press release said. ""We continue to aggressively investigate the matter and will take action where appropriate.""

A spokesperson told Business Insider that Office Depot continues to ""closely manage"" its response to the interaction.

On Friday, Nasdaq said it fired an employee for their remarks about Kirk because they violated company policy.

""We are aware of social media posts by an employee regarding the shooting of Charlie Kirk that were a clear violation of our policy. Nasdaq has a zero-tolerance policy toward violence and any commentary that condones or celebrates violence,"" the company said on X. ""The employee in question has been terminated, effective immediately.""

Political analyst Matthew Dowd was widely attacked online after making remarks about Kirk during an appearance on MSNBC's ""Katy Tur Reports"" on Wednesday.

MSNBC president Rebecca Kutler called Dowd's comments ""insensitive"" in an X post later that day.

""During our breaking news coverage of the shooting of Charlie Kirk, Matthew Dowd made comments that were inappropriate, insensitive, and unacceptable,"" the statement said. ""We apologize for his statements, as has he. There is no place for violence in America, political or otherwise.""

Dowd responded in a subsequent Substack article on Friday, confirming that MSNBC had fired him.

""The Right Wing media mob ginned up, went after me on a plethora of platforms, and MSNBC reacted to that mob,"" he wrote. ""Even though most at MSNBC knew my words were being misconstrued, the timing of my words forgotten (remember I said this before anyone knew Kirk was a target), and that I apologized for any miscommunication on my part, I was terminated by the end of the day.""

Comcast and Versant executives urged employees to ""treat people with kindness"" in a memo on Friday. Comcast is MSNBC's parent company. Versant is an independent media company being spun off from Comcast and NBCUniversal that will eventually own MSNBC.

""Regardless of whether you agreed with his political views, his words and actions underscore the urgency to maintain a respectful exchange of ideas — a principle we must champion,"" the memo said.

The memo added: ""As employees, we ask you to embody our values in your work and communities. We should engage with respect, listen, and treat people with kindness.""

Perkins Coie, a law firm already at odds with the Trump administration, didn't escape the fray either.

The firm fired a lawyer whose social media posts about Kirk gained attention online, where commentators noted his place of work, according to The Wall Street Journal.

""This is not who we are, and we have separated the individual from Perkins Coie,"" the law firm told the outlet.

On Thursday, the Carolina Panthers addressed comments from one of its employees, writing on X, ""The views expressed by our employees are their own and do not represent those of the Carolina Panthers.""

""We do not condone violence of any kind. We are taking this matter very seriously and have accordingly addressed it with the individual,"" the post said.

A source told The Athletic that the organization fired a public relations employee over his remarks about Kirk.

Delta Air Lines suspended an unknown number of employees over their social media posts about Kirk, a companywide memo viewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution showed.

The memo said those employees are under investigation because the content ""went well beyond healthy, respectful debate,"" Delta CEO Ed Bastian wrote in the memo, according to the AJC.

He added: ""Violations of our social media policy can carry meaningful consequences, including termination.""

Steve Witkoff, the real estate investor who serves as Donald Trump's special envoy for peace missions, sold an interest in his eponymous real estate management company for $120 million to resolve potential conflicts of interest, according to a financial disclosure released Saturday.

The document doesn't show whether it's been approved by ethics officials at the White House, and its release comes months after financial disclosures were made public for members of Trump's team whose tenure started on Jan. 20, the day he was inaugurated. The disclosure says Witkoff's official start date was June 30, even though he began working before Trump returned to office, helping to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

Iran's top security body warned that European threats to reinstate UN sanctions on the country could hinder efforts to restore international inspections at Iranian nuclear facilities.

In a statement on Sunday, the Supreme National Security Council — Iran's chief security and foreign policy body — said Tehran had agreed to submit reports on its nuclear sites to the International Atomic Energy Agency under an agreement that could pave the way for the Vienna-based agency to resume site visits.

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Sunday that the man arrested in connection with the killing of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk is ""not cooperating"" with authorities, days after he was booked into Utah County Jail.

While Cox said on ABC News' ""This Week"" that the suspect, identified as Tyler Robinson, is not cooperating, ""all the people around him are.""

The governor's comments come after the 22-year-old was arrested Friday after a manhunt that spanned more than 30 hours, and ultimately concluded when a family friend of the suspect contacted authorities.

The fatal shooting of Kirk, which occurred while he was speaking at a rally at Utah Valley University, has rattled the nation.

""If your view of America is not shaken right now, then there's something wrong with you,"" Cox said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

""This is a direct assault on America,"" he continued.

Investigators are still piecing together a motive for the killing. Cox said that the suspect participated frequently in gaming and internet culture.

""Friends have confirmed that there was that deep, dark internet, Reddit culture and these other dark places of the internet, where this person was going deep,"" Cox said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

""You saw that on the casings. I didn't have any idea what those inscriptions meant, but they are certainly the meme-ification that is happening in our society today.""

A number of casings found with the rifle allegedly used in the shooting were engraved with messages, including one that said, ""hey fascist! CATCH!""

The governor on Sunday also confirmed a New York Times report that said that Robinson had communicated on the messaging platform Discord after the shooting.

""All we can confirm is that those conversations definitely were happening, and they did not believe it was actually him,"" he said on ABC News.

""It was all joking until, until he, you know, until he admitted that it actually was him,"" he continued.

As many questions remain over the grisly killing, Cox said that official charges in the case are expected to be filed on Tuesday, ""and there will be much more evidence and information available then.""

""We're interviewing all kinds of people, everyone that knows him, and trying to learn more about what that motive actually was,"" he said.

Cox also confirmed reports that investigators have interviewed Robinson's roommate, who was described as a ""romantic partner"" and is transitioning from male to female.

""This partner has been incredibly cooperative, had no idea that this was happening, and is working with investigators right now,"" Cox said on CNN.

In this article

The latest earnings season has addressed investors' concerns about the artificial intelligence boom, thanks to the robust growth outlook and capital spending projections of many tech companies.

Investors seeking exposure to companies that are well-positioned to capture AI-led growth can track the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts, who can help pick the stocks that can deliver attractive returns over the long term.

Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on past performance.

Semiconductor company Broadcom (AVGO) reported impressive fiscal third-quarter results and issued solid guidance, thanks to AI tailwinds. AVGO stock rallied following the results, as the company stated that it has secured a new $10 billion customer. 

Citing strong fundamentals, JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur reaffirmed a buy rating on Broadcom stock and boosted the price target to $400 from $325, saying that AVGO remains a top pick in semiconductors. Likewise, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an ""outperform"" rating on AVGO stock with a price target of $396.

Sur attributed Broadcom's strong results and solid revenue outlook for the October quarter to accelerating AI demand, stabilizing non-AI semiconductors, and impressive momentum in the VMware business.

The 5-star analyst noted the 18% sequential growth in AVGO's Q3 FY25 AI revenue, with the company guiding a 19% quarter-over-quarter growth to $6.2 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter. He added that Broadcom is on track to deliver about $20 billion in AI revenue in fiscal 2025.

Sur believes that the new customer from whom Broadcom secured orders worth $10 billion is OpenAI, considering the AI inference use case and his prior research. The analyst now expects AI revenue to increase by 125% to $45 billion in fiscal 2026, followed by a 60% increase in fiscal 2027. Sur said the strength in AVGO's AI revenue supports his view that the company's internally developed custom AI chips offer meaningful differentiation, efficiency and improved economics.

""Despite macro volatility, Broadcom's diversified portfolio and product cycles support a solid revenue growth profile,"" concluded Sur.  

Sur ranks No. 39 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 67% of the time, delivering an average return of 26.1%. See Broadcom Statistics on TipRanks.

Next on this week's list is Zscaler (ZS), a cybersecurity company that recently delivered strong results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by demand for its Zero Trust and AI security solutions.

Impressed by the Q4 FY25 print, Stifel analyst Adam Borg reiterated a buy rating on Zscaler stock and raised the price forecast to $330 from $295. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a ""neutral"" stock on ZS stock with a price target of $298.

Borg stated that Zscaler delivered solid results, consistent with Stifel's positive checks. He added that the company's Q4 FY25 performance was strong across key metrics, driven by strong execution and demand for the company's broadening Zero-Trust portfolio. Borg was particularly pleased with robust growth in billings and remaining performance obligations. Notably, RPO growth (31%) accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter.

The 5-star analyst is optimistic about the adoption of Zscaler's offerings across emerging areas, like AI security. Borg is also upbeat about the company's newer solutions like Z-Flex. He continues to believe that ""Zscaler's leading-portfolio helps improve an organization's security posture, drives vendor consolidation, and reduces costs.""

Bord expects Zscaler to sustain at least high-teens top-line growth and margin expansion in the coming years, driven by multiple drivers.

Borg ranks No. 324 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 77% of the time, delivering an average return of 16.9%. See Zscaler Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

Database software maker and cloud infrastructure company Oracle (ORCL) saw its stock spike this week, as the company's robust cloud growth projections overshadowed its Q1 earnings miss. The company surprised the market by reporting a 359% year-over-year growth in its remaining performance obligations, a measure of contracted revenue, to $455 billion.

Oracle's robust outlook made Jefferies analyst Brent Thill increase his price target to $360 from $270 while reiterating a buy rating on the stock. TipRanks' AI Analyst also has an ""outperform"" rating on ORCL stock with a price target of $264.

""RPO stole the show in F1Q,"" stated Thill. The 5-star analyst added that Oracle's Q1 RPO crushed estimates and reinforced his confidence in the company's narrative about acceleration in its growth.

Thill highlighted that Oracle added $317 billion sequentially in RPO, nearly five times the fiscal 2026 total revenue estimate of $67 billion, which supports growing AI optimism. He noted that this massive growth can be mainly attributed to four multi-billion-dollar contracts across three customers, with more such deals expected to close soon and drive RPO beyond $500 billion.

The analyst also pointed out that the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) business is expected to grow by 77% to $18 billion in fiscal 2026 and then jump to $144 billion by fiscal 2030. Thill added that this impressive growth forecast indicates the rising demand for AI inference and training workloads, which management sees as a massive total addressable market that the company can capture.

Additionally, Thill mentioned the impressive surge in Oracle's multicloud database revenue, though off smaller numbers, suggesting rapid adoption of the company's multicloud strategy. In fact, Oracle now expects notable growth in multicloud revenue every quarter for the next several years while expanding to 71 (net addition of 37) data centers across hyperscaler peers.

Thill ranks No. 128 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 67% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.9%. See Oracle Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.

UnitedHealth has sought meetings with U.S. President Donald Trump, although it has not secured a meeting yet, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.

UnitedHealth CEO Stephen Hemsley recently met White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles to discuss Medicare and other issues, WSJ said, citing a White House official.

Hemsley also had dinner with Chris Klomp, the official overseeing Medicare in the summer, and discussed Medicare-plan billing policies and supplemental benefits offered under the private Medicare plans, the newspaper said.

In a statement to the WSJ, UnitedHealth said that ""public policy shapes healthcare across America, and it's our responsibility to engage with the administration and Congress at all levels to improve patient access and affordability,"" it said, adding that it is especially true now ""as critical decisions are being made.""

""The Administration routinely meets with insurers to deliver on the President's mandate of improving healthcare and lowering costs for everyday Americans,"" Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, told the WSJ.

U.S. and Chinese officials began talks in Madrid on Sunday on their strained trade ties, a looming divestiture deadline for Chinese short video app TikTok and Washington's demands that its allies place tariffs on China over its purchases of Russian oil.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer arrived shortly before Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and China's top trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, at the Baroque Palacio de Santa Cruz which houses Spain's foreign ministry in the Spanish capital.

The talks mark the fourth time in four months that the delegations have met in European cities to try to keep a fractured U.S.-China trade relationship from collapsing under President Donald Trump's tariffs.

The delegations last met in Stockholm in July where they agreed in principle to extend for 90 days a trade truce that sharply reduced triple-digit retaliatory tariffs on both sides and restarted the flow of rare-earth minerals from China to the United States.

Trump has approved the extension of current U.S. tariff rates on Chinese goods, totaling about 55%, until Nov. 10.

Trade experts said there was little likelihood of a substantial breakthrough in the talks hosted by Spain, which has sought to improve ties with Beijing in recent years.

The most likely result of the Madrid talks is seen as another extension of a deadline for the popular TikTok app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations by Sept. 17 or face a U.S. shutdown.

A source familiar with the Trump administration's discussions on TikTok's future said that a deal was not expected, but that the deadline would be extended for a fourth time since Trump took office in January.

Trump last month launched a TikTok account.

TikTok has not been discussed in previous rounds of U.S.-China trade talks in Geneva, London and Stockholm. But the source said the issue's public inclusion as an agenda item on the Treasury's announcement of the talks gives the Trump administration political cover for another extension, which may annoy both Republicans and Democrats in Congress who mandated TikTok's sale to a U.S. entity to reduce national security risks.

Wendy Cutler, a former USTR trade negotiator and head of the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington, said she expected more substantial ""deliverables"" to be saved for a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later this year, perhaps at an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Seoul at the end of October.

These may include a final deal to resolve U.S. national security concerns over TikTok, and a lifting of restrictions on Chinese purchases of American soybeans and reduction of fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese goods, and the Madrid discussions may help lay groundwork for such a meeting, Cutler said.

But she said resolving core U.S. economic complaints about China, including its demands that China shift its economic model toward more domestic consumption and rely less on state-subsidized exports, could take years.

""Frankly, I don't think China is in any rush to do an agreement where they don't get substantial concessions on export controls and lower tariffs, which are their key priorities,"" Cutler said. ""And I don't see the United States in a position to make major concessions on either, unless there's some breakthrough on its demands to China.""

The Treasury has said the Madrid talks also would cover joint U.S.-Chinese efforts to combat money laundering, a reference to its longstanding demands that China clamp down on illicit shipments of technology goods to Russia that aid its war in Ukraine. 

Bessent urged Group of Seven allies on Friday to impose ""meaningful tariffs"" on imports from China and India to pressure them to stop buying Russian oil, a move aimed at bringing Moscow into Ukraine peace negotiations by curbing its oil revenues. 

The G7 finance ministers said on Friday they discussed such measures and agreed to speed up discussions to use frozen Russian assets to aid Ukraine's defense.

Bessent and Greer said in a separate statement that G7 allies should join the United States in imposing tariffs on buyers of Russian oil. ""Only with a unified effort that cuts off the revenues funding Putin's war machine at the source will we be able to apply sufficient economic pressure to end the senseless killing,"" Bessent and Greer said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The U.S. has imposed an extra 25% tariff on Indian goods over the country's purchases of Russian oil, but has so far refrained from imposing such punitive duties on Chinese goods.

China's Ministry of Commerce has said the Madrid talks will cover economic and trade issues such as U.S. tariffs, the ""abuse"" of export controls and TikTok.

Spanish foreign minister José Manuel Albares publicly greeted the two delegations before the start of talks.

A Spanish government source said the choice of Spain for the latest round of the ""delicate"" talks was evidence that Madrid was consolidating itself as a seat of high-level and strategic negotiations. Madrid has sought to be a venue for an international peace conference to resolve the Israel-Palestinian conflict.

The source said Spain's government also takes advantage of the event to reinforce its own bilateral relations with the U.S. following a series of tense engagements with the Trump administration. Spain has criticised Israel's offensive in Gaza and refused to commit to spending 5% of its budget on defense along with other NATO members.

Bessent himself has also criticized Spain for declaring Beijing a ""strategic partner"" at the height of Trump's tariff offensive in April, saying that a closer relationship with the Asian giant was akin to ""cutting your own throat.""

In this article

Anyone who has ever gone in search of a product review on Amazon knows how valuable the experience of other shoppers can be, and how easy it is to fall down the rabbit hole of customer comments, from five-star raves to one-star takedowns — sometimes hundreds of words to get to the point. As Amazon continues to roll out AI features it says will make shopping easier, AI-generated audio descriptions of products are in the mix and scraping that customer commentary — maybe ultimately settling into a position to replace it as a go-to source of buying information. 

Called ""Hear the Highlights,"" the AI-voiced product descriptions rely on a large language model to script the summary based on a variety of sources, pulling from Amazon's product catalog, customer reviews, and information from across the web, and then translating the content into short-form audio clips. The summaries began rolling out during the summer on select products to a subset of U.S. customers and have now reached all U.S. customers as a button in the mobile shopping app, scaling up to cover over one million products.

A unique appeal of Amazon, and other e-commerce options, has always been the ability to get information from actual users, not just product descriptions. Of course, bogus reviews have long been a problem for Amazon, even though it bans use of paid promotion and other inauthentic forms of review writing. You still have to sort through various efforts to game the system, and in recent years, signs that the newest review writers are chatbots like ChatGPT. But actual people sharing their actual, idiosyncratic experience with a product — customers as a source of information, and informed decision making — have been a key part of the learning process from clothing and shoe sizes to safety and more narrow questions: When purchasing a new toaster, does it do bagels, is the timer setting accurate, how easy is it to clean the crumb tray?

Can AI improve on that? Reviews are by nature unwieldy in the mass individuality, but human readers have proven pretty adept at distilling what they need from the human chaos. In some sense, the brain of the average Amazon review reader is a pretty good large language model, skimming and picking out key words and key information, so an AI will have to do it at least as well as a human would if it's to add to the customer experience as promised. 

AI does have its advantages. For one, it won't experience cognitive overload when facing an electric tea kettle on Amazon with over 32,000 reviews. It can comb through the data, but can it gives us only what we need or want to know? That can still be tricky for AI to get right, and it may be inherently problematic to mix product catalogs, customer reviews, and web information into a single distillation – with the sources of this information each coming with its own set of intentions.

""It's important to recognize where AI is currently strong, such as in automation and pattern recognition, and where it still falls short, like in judgment-heavy tasks,"" said Ankur Edkie, CEO & co-founder, Murf AI, which creates AI voiceovers. ""A key question is whether there's a way to factor in customer context as an input while generating these summaries,"" he said.

The value of AI, according to Edkie, is finding the proper problem-capability fit. If that isn't achieved, the sense of gimmickry is likely to sneak in through a door left open for AI fatigue, which he says consumers are likely experiencing by now.

Amazon's Hear the Highlights AI-audio summaries are currently the same for every user.

""The AI summary needs to capture nuance and context. For example, even a few negative reviews on safety can outweigh many positives on other features,"" Edkie said, adding that if a customer is focused solely on product performance, then summaries that emphasize price might not be relevant. 

The ability to factor in context, and to make the review process more of a dialogue between consumer and machine is likely where the technology is headed – in other words, toward the agentic side of AI, where Amazon is also actively adding to its AI commerce tools, such as Rufus, and a shopping tool called Interests AI, which prompts users to describe an interest ""using your own words,"" and then it generates a curated selection of products. That feature, rolled out in the spring, is separate from the main search bar on Amazon's website. 

Chat and audio summaries will remain among the ways to engage, but having real-time conversations with an AI voice agent — asking specific questions, clarifying concerns, and getting deeper insights from reviews — is what will shift the experience from one-way delivery to two-way discovery, making it far more personalized, according to Edkie. ""Currently, you can interact with Rufus through text or by using voice input, but Rufus cannot talk back, its responses are text-only,"" he said. ""With voice agents, however, you can have a two-way conversation with a bot that speaks to you,"" he added. 

For now, one segment of customers likely to see immediate benefits is visually impaired shoppers, making accessibility an intriguing aspect of the feature, but the voice must be high-quality and deliver the content accurately.

Brian Numainville, principal at consumer research firm Feedback Group, says by providing an audio-based alternative to visually presented information, these types of features have the potential to make shopping more accessible, converting detailed text into easily consumed audio summaries. However, for it to truly benefit people with visual impairments, the feature must be thoughtfully designed. According to Numainville, this would include ensuring full compatibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation, providing clear, structured, and concise summaries, and avoiding overly long or confusing audio presentations. The quality and clarity of the AI-generated voice will also significantly impact usability. 

""The shift from diverse human reviews to AI-generated summaries might mean losing important nuances, context, and personal touches,"" Numainville said.

The tendency of AI to focus on common themes can dilute responses even as it distills them.

Human reviews tend to include digressive stories and details around highly specific use cases — think of what motivates someone to write a review in the first place, and how this pairs well with the shopper's anxieties and decision-making process — all of which can help to make the shopping experience more personal and insightful. 

""AI might overlook unique insights or niche needs that don't align with the majority of responses,"" Numainville said. ""Additionally, the ability to critically interpret reviews — like spotting biases or trusting certain reviewers — is diminished with AI summaries.""  

Scraping a great deal of content to generate the summaries also sacrifices the annotation that can distinguish among product descriptions, customer reviews, and web information.

""It's not 100% clear how much of the product description versus reviews is used in the current implementation — Amazon hasn't fully detailed this mix,"" said Numainville. 

Amazon declined to comment, referring CNBC to publicly available information on the feature.

""Product descriptions are typically marketing-driven and emphasize positives, whereas reviews reflect real user experiences and include both pros and cons,"" Numainville said. Mixed without attribution — which by definition flattens information sources — it could be difficult for customers to discern ad-speak from genuine reviews, with the results be something like native advertising.

""This blending, if it occurred, could unintentionally mislead consumers by lending factual authority to subjective opinions or disguising promotional material as unbiased reviews,"" Numainville said. 

Research does show that customers are inclined to trust voice as a format of information delivery, regardless of how balanced the information being delivered is.

""It seems likely to me Amazon's desire to sell products would weigh more highly than incorporating all critical perspectives on a product,"" said Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University in Australia.

Another concern is that ""AI might weigh average and overall scores, while buyers often look at the few negative reviews – the one stars – even if there isn't a lot of them,"" Leaver said.

Dr. Nauman Dawalatabad, a research scientist at Zoom Communications, said in his personal view the technology is moving in the direction of better customer experience. ""I take it as technology helping us to make informed decisions,"" he said, citing the cognitive fatigue and wasted time that can come from reading through customer reviews.

If a streamlined description ends up leading to impulse purchases and regrets, that is on the buyer, he says, and no different than the way things have always operated — the same charges of subtle coercion could be made against all marketing efforts. He thinks that as voice-based agentic AI continues to evolve and consumers start talking (instead of typing and searching) with an AI agent and describe what they want, ""it will get you exactly what you need.""

A state visit always sends a buzz through the newsroom — and U.S. President Donald Trump's trip to the U.K. next week looks set to deliver royal, political and business headlines, despite being his second such visit.

Wednesday will bring the royal pomp and ceremony.

Trump and First Lady Melania will be greeted at Windsor Castle by King Charles and Queen Camilla with a royal salute, followed by a carriage procession.

Later, the president will lay a wreath on the tomb of Queen Elizabeth II, which will be followed by a flypast of American F-35 military jets alongside the British Red Arrows. The day will end with a state banquet, during which both the king and president will make speeches.

On Thursday, it's down to business.

Trump will head to Chequers, the country house of sitting U.K. prime ministers, where he'll meet Keir Starmer for a series of bilateral meetings, followed by a joint press conference later that day.

From a foreign policy perspective, the timing is awkward.

Starmer has just fired the U.K.'s U.S. ambassador Peter Mandelson, citing fresh details over his connections with disgraced pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Downing Street had pinned much hope on Mandelson to reinvigorate the ""special relationship"" between the two nations.

Interestingly, just two weeks ago, the Telegraph reported that Trump had invited Mandelson's predecessor, Karen Pierce, to this week's state banquet, in a sign that trouble may already have been brewing.

But back to business. Both Trump and Starmer may be depending on the tech bros to bring some positive headlines.

CNBC's Ryan Browne reported Friday that Nvidia and OpenAI — which are both part of the U.S. business delegation traveling with Trump — are set to make major U.K. investment commitments. The two tech firms are discussing a sizable deal to support data center development in the country, which could ultimately be worth billions of dollars, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will also attend the state banquet at Windsor Castle, as well as the meetings with Starmer.

Bessent will be fresh off the plane from Madrid, Spain, where he is meeting with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng for the fourth round of trade talks between the U.S. and China. They are also expected to address the future of TikTok, which faces another deadline on Sept. 17, to decide on either an American ban on the social media app, or a partial sale by its Chinese parent ByteDance.

It's a lot for one week. And while state visits are known for their meticulous planning, the newsroom will be keeping its eyes and ears open for any unexpected moments — whether it's a hot-mic slip-up, controversial outfit choice, exotic banquet menu selection, or any other surprises that could come our way.

Monday: EU trade data

Tuesday: U.K. unemployment data

Wednesday: EU and U.K. inflation data

Thursday: Bank of England policy decision

Friday: U.K. retail sales

Romania scrambled fighter jets on Saturday when a drone breached the country's airspace during a Russian attack on Ukrainian infrastructure near the border, the defense ministry said.

Defense Minister Ionut Mosteanu said the F-16 pilots came close to taking down the drone as it was flying very low before it left national airspace toward Ukraine.

A threat of drone strikes also prompted Poland to deploy aircraft and close an airport in the eastern city of Lublin on Saturday, three days after it shot down Russian drones in its airspace with the backing of aircraft from its NATO allies.

Romania, a European Union and NATO state which shares a 650-km (400-mile) border with Ukraine, has had Russian drone fragments fall onto its territory repeatedly since Russia began waging war on its neighbor.

On Saturday, it scrambled two F-16 fighter jets and later two Eurofighters - part of German air policing missions in Romania - and warned citizens in the southeastern county of Tulcea near the Danube and its Ukrainian border to take cover, the defense ministry said in a statement.

It added the jets detected a drone in national airspace, which they followed until it dropped off the radar 20 km southwest of the village of Chilia Veche.

Mosteanu told private television station Antena 3 that helicopters will survey the area near the border to look for potential drone parts, ""but all information at this moment indicates the drone exited airspace to Ukraine.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on social media platform X that data showed the drone breached about 10 kilometers into Romanian territory and operated in NATO airspace for around 50 minutes.

""It is an obvious expansion of the war by Russia – and this is exactly how they act,"" he said. ""Sanctions against Russia are needed. Tariffs against Russian trade are needed. Collective defense is needed.""

NATO announced plans to beef up the defense of Europe's eastern flank on Friday, after Poland shot down drones that had violated its airspace, the first known shots fired by a member of the Western alliance during Russia's war in Ukraine.

Romanian lawmakers approved a law earlier this year enabling the army to shoot down drones illegally breaching Romanian airspace during peacetime, based on threat levels and risks to human life and property, but the bill does not yet have all enforcement rules approved.

Swedish Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard wrote on platform X that the airspace breach was ""another unacceptable violation of NATO airspace.""

""Sweden stands in full solidarity with Romania as a NATO Ally and EU Member State. We are always ready to contribute further to the deterrence and defence of the Alliance.""

Saquon Barkley has earned nearly $80 million in NFL salary and bonuses since 2018.

Instead of spending that money lavishly, the Philadelphia Eagles running back has invested millions of it in a variety of venture funds and tech startups, according to a report published by The Profile on September 3.

Those funds and startups reportedly include artificial intelligence firm Anthropic, Elon Musk-owned neurotech company Neuralink, prediction market Polymarket and venture capital fund Founders Fund, which is run by billionaire investor and political activist Peter Thiel.

""I was just thinking about how I can only play for so long, so I really gotta take advantage, keep investing, and create wealth for me and my family,"" Barkley told The Profile.

After Barkley became the No. 2 pick in the 2018 NFL draft, he signed a $31.2 million contract — and, wary of overspending and watching his sudden fortune quickly vanish, vowed to invest while living off his endorsement deals instead.

""When I declared for the NFL draft and kind of realized where I was going to be drafted, that was something I was like, 'You know what? Kind of want to follow the Marshawn Lynch method. I don't want to touch that. I want to invest it, put it in the right peoples' hands and learn as I continue to make investments. And just live off the endorsement deals,'"" Barkley told ESPN in June 2018.

Barkley has endorsement deals with brands including Nike, Pepsi and Toyota. He earns an estimated $10 million per year from endorsements, sports marketing analyst Bob Dorfman told Front Office Sports in January.

The NFL star initially parked much of his rookie contract in traditional long-term investments like S&P 500 index funds, The Profile reported. He's also put some of his earnings into real estate, including his recent purchase of a $3.9 million home in Malvern, Pennsylvania.

More recently, he's embraced some risk — investing in mobile payments app Strike in 2021, and announcing plans to convert all his marketing and endorsement earnings to bitcoin using the app, for example. Since then, the price of bitcoin has more than tripled, ""turning a $10 million income stream into a $35 million asset,"" The Profile noted.

More broadly, startup investing can be a risky approach to money management: Young companies, even trendy ones with lofty valuations, are never guaranteed to succeed. Barkley has funded more than 10 startups, usually at between $250,000 and $500,000 per startup, The Profile reported — likely only constituting a fraction of his career earnings, so far.

His shift into startup investing began after he read Thiel's book ""Zero to One,"" and he identifies his targets through word-of-mouth referrals from his business manager Ken Katz's investor network, according to The Profile. Barkley interrogates a company's founder or founders directly before choosing to invest, he told the publication.

""It's about asking them what they stand for, what their mission is, why they think they'll be successful,"" said Barkley. ""They have to be confident, but arrogance is a turn-off.""

Barkley, 28, kicked off his 8th NFL season — more than double the length of the average NFL player's career — on September 4. He received some extra motivation to grow his wealth as much as possible during his playing career from a severe injury in 2020, when a torn ACL cause him to miss most of his third NFL season, he told the ""The Best Business Show"" podcast in an episode that aired in July 2021.

The injury forced Barkley to reflect, he said: Running backs endure a lot of physical contact, and tend to have shorter careers than many other professional athletes. If he wasn't going to play for as long as some other superstar athletes — people like LeBron James or Tom Brady — he needed to embrace financial strategies outside of football ""to create generational wealth"" with his paychecks, he said.

""When you sit out of football for a whole year, you realize that this game could be taken away from you,"" said Barkley.

 Capital Group has turned a $1 billion bet on Bitcoin treasury stocks into $6 billion, with major holdings in Strategy and Metaplanet. 

Capital Group, a 94-year-old mutual fund powerhouse known for its conservative investment approach, has grown a $1 billion position in Bitcoin-related stocks into more than $6 billion.

Mark Casey, a portfolio manager with 25 years at Capital Group, led the firm's move into Bitcoin. Casey, who describes his investment style as shaped by Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett, has become an advocate for Bitcoin (BTC), according to a Sunday report by The Wall Street Journal. 

“I just love Bitcoin, I just think it is so interesting,” Casey said during a podcast interview with venture firm Andreessen Horowitz. He called Bitcoin “one of the coolest things that has ever been created by people,” per the WSJ report.

Over the past four years, Capital Group has built its exposure primarily through investments in so-called Bitcoin treasury companies, public firms that accumulate and hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets.

Capital Group's most notable holding is in Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), the software firm transformed into a Bitcoin vehicle by founder Michael Saylor.

In 2021, Capital Group acquired a 12.3% stake in Strategy for over $500 million. That stake, now diluted to 7.89% due to share issuance and some trimming, is worth about $6.2 billion following a more than 2,200% surge in Strategy's stock over five years.

Casey said he and his colleagues analyze these companies the same way they assess firms involved in commodities like gold or oil. “We view Bitcoin as a commodity,” he told the WSJ.

Capital Group's Bitcoin exposure also includes a 5% stake in Japan-based Metaplanet, a hotel operator-turned-Bitcoin holder, and shares of mining company Mara Holdings.

As Cointelegraph reported, corporate Bitcoin treasuries now hold over 1 million BTC worth more than $117 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. 

Michael Saylor's Strategy remains the top holder with 636,505 BTC, followed by MARA Holdings with over 52,000 BTC. Newcomers like XXI and Bitcoin Standard Treasury are quickly gaining ground, while firms like Metaplanet, Bullish and Coinbase round out the top 10.

Looking ahead, companies like Metaplanet and Semler Scientific have revealed aggressive accumulation targets, aiming to acquire 210,000 BTC and 105,000 BTC by 2027, respectively.

When Core Scientific signed a $3.5 billion deal to host artificial intelligence (AI) data centers earlier this year, it wasn't chasing the next crypto token — it was chasing a steadier paycheck. Once known for its vast fleets of bitcoin mining rigs, the company is now part of a growing trend: converting energy-intensive mining operations into high-performance AI facilities.

Bitcoin miners like Core, Hut 8 (HUT) and TeraWulf (WULF) are swapping ASIC machines — the dedicated bitcoin mining computer — for GPU clusters, driven by the lure of AI's explosive growth and the harsh economics of crypto mining. 

It's no secret that bitcoin mining requires an extensive amount of energy, which is the biggest cost of minting a new digital asset. 

Back in the 2021 bull run, when the Bitcoin network's hashrate and difficulty were low, miners were making out like bandits with margins as much as 90%. Then came the brutal crypto winter and the halving event, which slashed the mining reward in half. In 2025, with surging hashrate and energy prices, miners are now struggling to survive with razor-thin margins. 

However, the need for power—the biggest input cost—became a blessing in disguise for these miners, who needed a different strategy to diversify their revenue sources. 

Due to rising competition for mining, the miners continued to procure more machines to stay afloat, and with it came the need for more megawatts of electricity at a cheaper price. Miners invested heavily in securing these low-cost energy sources, such as hydroelectric or stranded natural gas sites, and developed expertise in managing high-density cooling and electrical systems—skills honed during the crypto boom of the early 2020s. 

This is what captured the attention of AI and cloud computing firms. While bitcoin relies on specialized ASICs, AI thrives on versatile GPUs like Nvidia's H100 series, which require similar high-power environments but for parallel processing tasks in machine learning. Instead of building out data centers from scratch, taking over mining infrastructure, which already has power ready, became a faster way to grow an increasing appetite for AI-related infrastructure. 

Essentially, these miners aren't just pivoting—they're retrofitting. 

The cooling systems, low-cost energy contracts, and power-dense infrastructure they built during the crypto boom now serve a new purpose: feeding the AI models of companies like OpenAI and Google.

Firms like Crusoe Energy sold off mining assets to focus solely on AI, deploying GPU clusters in remote, energy-rich locations that mirror the decentralized ethos of crypto but now fuel centralized AI hyperscalers.

Bitcoin mining has effectively ""terraformed"" the terrain for AI compute by building out scalable, power-efficient infrastructure that AI desperately needs. 

As Nicholas Gregory, Board Director at Fragrant Prosperity, noted, ""It can be argued bitcoin paved the way for digital dollar payments as can be seen with USDT/Tether. It also looks like bitcoin terraformed data centres for AI/GPU compute.""

This pre-existing ""terraforming"" allows miners to retrofit facilities quickly, often in under a year, compared to the multi-year timelines for traditional data center builds. Firms like Crusoe Energy sold off mining assets to focus solely on AI, deploying GPU clusters in remote, energy-rich locations that mirror the decentralized ethos of crypto but now fuel centralized AI hyperscalers.

In practice, it means miners can flip a facility in less than a year—far faster than the multi-year timeline of a new data center. 

But AI isn't a cheap upgrade. 

Bitcoin mining setups are relatively modest, with costs ranging from $300,000 to $800,000 per megawatt (MW) excluding ASICs, allowing for quick scalability in response to market cycles. Meanwhile, AI infrastructure demands significantly higher capex due to the need for advanced liquid cooling, redundant power systems, and the GPUs themselves, which can cost tens of thousands per unit and face global supply shortages. Despite the steeper upfront costs, AI offers miners up to 25 times more revenue per kilowatt-hour than bitcoin mining, making the pivot economically compelling amid rising energy prices and declining crypto profitability.

As AI continues to surge and crypto profits tighten, bitcoin mining could become a niche game—one reserved for energy-rich regions or highly efficient players, especially as the next in 2028 could render many operations unprofitable without breakthroughs in efficiency or energy costs.

While projections show the global crypto mining market growing to $3.3 billion by 2030, at a modest 6.9% CAGR, the billions would be overshadowed by AI's exponential expansion. According to KBV Research, the global AI in mining market is projected to reach $435.94 billion by 2032, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40.6%. 

With investors already seeing dollar signs in this shift, the broader trend suggests the future is either a hybrid or a full conversion to AI, where stable contracts with hyperscalers promise longevity over crypto's boom-bust cycles. 

This evolution not only repurposes idle assets but also underscores how yesterday's crypto frontiers are forging tomorrow's AI empires.

Companies such as Strategy and Metaplanet have risen to industry stardom and stock market success after becoming Bitcoin (BTC) treasuries.

Other institutions have been scrambling to rebrand publicly traded firms or launch entirely new ones to become Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies.

This new wave of publicly traded firms that are actively stacking gigantic sums of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptos are collectively referred to as Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies.

DATs are publicly traded entities that raise capital, typically via share sales or bonds, specifically to fuel and support the acquisition, holding, and management of one or more digital assets as a core part of their balance sheet strategy.

They can also generate revenues through various means, such as borrowing and lending services, operating validator nodes, DeFi protocols, etc.

Essentially, they've investment vehicles that provide indirect exposure to crypto via traditional markets.

Here's the current overview of DAT holdings across major cryptos as of Sept. 11, 2025.

As the world's favourite crypto, it's only natural that the trend began here.

According to CoinGecko data , 104 Bitcoin treasury companies hold a combined 1,013,608 BTC worth $115.5 billion

The largest is Michael Saylor's Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which pioneered the crypto treasury strategy model in 2020 and now holds 631,460 BTC  worth $72.64 billion.

Since initiating the plan, the firm's stock has risen 2319.94% – in that same time, Bitcoin rose 899%.

After Bitcoin's remarkable rise in value, an increasing number of firms have begun looking to the world's number two token, Ethereum, which is now a rising star amongst institutions.

According to CoinGecko data , just 11 companies are actively acquiring Ethereum. That said, they collectively hold 3,436,285 ETH worth $15.23 billion.

Bitmine Immersion currently leads the ETH treasury race with 2,069,443 ETH, currently worth $9.1 billion.

Not far behind it is SharpLink, which has been aggressively acquiring tokens and now commands 837,230 ETH worth $3.69 billion.

Though currently ranked sixth by market cap, the Solana token is the third most-traded crypto on the market by volume, excluding stablecoins.

According to CoinGecko data , there are 7 publicly traded Solana treasury companies. Together, they hold 6,489,161 SOL worth over $1.46 billion.

Leading the competition is DeFi Development Corp, which currently commands 2,027,817 SOL worth $458.4 million.

It's a close race. In second and third place are Upexi with 2,000,518 SOL, and Sharps Technology with 2,000,000 SOL; each is valued at around $452 million.

Several other altcoin treasuries have been established, mostly this year.

Just two companies are building treasuries using the token of the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange. They hold a combined  516,888 BNB worth $465.02 million.

Then there's Dogecoin (DOGE), the world's most valuable and beloved memecoin, which also has  two treasury firms behind it.

Together, they hold 355,963,754 DOGE worth $88.91 million.

Up next is the native token for decentralized exchange (DEX) and Layer-1 blockchain, HyperLiquid (HYPE).

It has just one publicly traded company backing it, Lion Group Holding, which currently has 128,929 HYPE tokens worth $7.03 million.

Notably, the firm recently  switched all its Sui (SUI) holdings out for HYPE and SOL tokens.

High-performance Layer-1 chain Sui (SUI) now has just one  treasury company behind it, SUI Group Holdings, which commands  101,795,656 SUI worth $361.14 million.

As per CoinGecko data , TRON (TRX) has one backer, Tron Inc., which holds 677,596,945 TRX worth $234.24 million.

By Sam Cooling

Analysts are highlighting ETH USD priming to retest $4,700 – and amid the upside pressure – is dark money rotating into Ethereum?

A wallet tied to a $300M Coinbase scam bought $18.9M worth of Ether as ETH ripped past $4,700 Yesterday.

According to Lookonchain, a crypto address linked to the “Coinbase hacker” campaign bought 3,976 ETH for $18.9 million on Sept. 13.

— Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 13, 2025



The purchases, made at an average price of $4,756, came as Ether pushed past the $4,700 mark.

Analysts tracking the wallet say the funds were funneled through 18.911 million DAI before being converted to ETH. Arkham Intelligence data shows the wallet aggregated DAI in amounts ranging from $80,000 to $6 million before swapping. 

The address has also been active recently, picking up 4,863 ETH and 649 ETH in July and around $8 million worth of Solana in August.

Blockchain investigator ZachXBT estimated that the broader scheme drained at least $330 million from victims earlier this year.

The operation, described as a wide-scale social engineering campaign, targeted Coinbase users and has kept the wallet under close surveillance from on-chain analysts.

The timing of the latest ETH accumulation has reinforced speculation of a market rotation into Ether. 

Traders noted the wallet's moves coincided with renewed momentum in ETH/USD, adding weight to the narrative that deep-pocketed actors are shifting into the asset.

Ethereum is showing renewed strength, with technical signals pointing to a possible breakout that could send prices toward $5,500.

As per Tradingview data, ETH trades near $4,660, holding above its short-term moving averages on the 4-hour chart.

The 50-EMA sits at $4,462 and the 100-EMA at $4,421, both trending upward. This setup suggests buyers remain in control despite minor pullbacks. 

Recent sessions have also seen higher volume, supporting the move that lifted ETH from the $4,300 range to above $4,650 in just a few days.

The broader structure shows a recovery trend after weeks of sideways action. Short-term candles reveal brief dips followed by fresh buying, a sign of steady demand. 

If ETH holds support above the 50-EMA, momentum may continue. If not, price risks sliding back to the $4,400-$4,300 zone, where both moving averages converge.

Analyst Titan of Crypto pointed to an Adam & Eve double-bottom pattern on the daily chart. 



(Source – X)

The formation combines a sharp “V”-shaped low with a rounded base, signaling a potential reversal. The neckline lies just below $4,700, close to current levels.

A confirmed breakout above that neckline would project a measured move target of $5,500, in line with historical resistance. This adds weight to the view that Ethereum could be setting up for a more substantial rally if buying pressure holds.

If Ethereum breaks above the neckline, traders could turn bullish, with $5,500 as the next target. But if it fails, the price may pull back to test how solid the recent rally really is.

Derivatives activity shows elevated positioning. CoinGlass data puts ETH futures open interest near $64Bn, while funding rates last session hovered around 0.01% across major exchanges, steady, but not excessive.

Spot ETF flows have also improved. On Sept. 12, after several days of outflows, Farside Investors reported net inflows into US ETH funds, pointing to fresh institutional demand.

Arslan Butt is an experienced webinar speaker, market analyst, and content writer specializing in crypto, forex, and commodities. He provides expert insights, trading strategies, and in-depth analysis...

Ethereum (ETH) is back in the spotlight as it consolidates around $4,640 after a strong move up from its base at $4,070 in early September. The second-largest cryptocurrency has gained over 13% in two weeks and is now within striking distance of the $5,000 psychological level. 

At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $4,639 with a market capitalization of $559.9 billion and a daily trading volume of $27.9 billion.

One of the most significant bullish factors for Ethereum is its supply squeeze. Exchange reserves have dropped to 18.8 million ETH, the lowest level since 2016, and staking activity has surged, with over 36 million ETH (approximately 30% of the supply) now staked.

This reduces circulating supply, tightens liquidity, and puts upward pressure on price. Analysts also note that whale wallets and institutions have been quietly accumulating ETH, adding to the confidence in Ethereum's long-term.

Key takeaways from the supply side:

From a technical perspective, the Ethereum price prediction is slightly bullish as ETH is in an ascending channel, with price action making higher lows and testing the channel's upper boundary. 

The breakout above $4,450 was confirmed by long green candles, a bullish engulfing pattern.

Momentum indicators are adding nuance. RSI has cooled from 69 to 60, so there's room for consolidation without weakness. A spinning top or Doji candle could form here, indicating market indecision before the next move.

Ethereum holds $4,640 after a 13% surge in 2 weeks. Price is pressing against the channel top, with support at $4,425 & resistance at $4,760. A break above could target $4,945. RSI cooling signals consolidation before the next leg. #ETH #Ethereum pic.twitter.com/VKDvJpvFoH

A daily close above $4,760 would likely lead to $4,945 and then $5,135, the level where previous rallies stalled. Sentiment remains positive, supported by both fundamentals and technicals.

Ethereum's On-Balance Volume (OBV) recently flashed an accumulation signal before the recent move. Volume is up 12.26% in 24 hours to $43.4 billion, confirming the momentum.

For traders, a long entry above $4,600 with stops under $4,425 is a good setup. Targets are initially $4,760, then $4,945, and then $5,135. 

For newcomers, the summary is straightforward: ETH is in a bullish channel, and as long as it holds above the moving averages, the odds are in favor of a move to $5,000 and beyond.

With institutional accumulation, shrinking exchange reserves and strong technicals all lining up, Ethereum may be about to make a big move.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation.

By combining BTC's unmatched security with Solana's high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development.

The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations.

Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $15.6 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today's stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012915—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses.

You can buy HYPER tokens on the official Bitcoin Hyper website using crypto or a bank card.

ETH is now increasingly being viewed as a long-term strategic asset. This has led to higher demand from market participants.

The Ethereum network has been on a positive roll for some time, with its momentum extending beyond on-chain activities to increased adoption.

Analysts at the crypto research firm CryptoQuant noted in their weekly report that Ethereum has come a long way since spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were approved. Like bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) is now increasingly being viewed as a long-term strategic asset. This has led to higher demand from market participants.

According to CryptoQuant, demand from institutional investors and large holders drove ether's recent rally from $1,400 in April 2025 to nearly $5,000 in late August. Ethereum holdings by U.S. spot ETFs have risen to an all-time high (ATH) of 6.7 million ETH. The assets have almost doubled since the price of ETH began to surge.

Likewise, addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH have scooped up roughly six million tokens within the same time period. The consistent accumulation has taken their holdings to new highs of 20.6 million ETH.

“This level of institutional endorsement provides a robust long-term tailwind for Ethereum's price and perceived legitimacy,” analysts explained.

Besides rising demand, selling pressure on ETH has eased up. The amount of ETH flowing into centralized exchanges has declined, particularly since the asset reached its peak near $5,000. Daily inflows have fallen from 1.8 million in mid-August to 750,000 ETH currently. This indicates that investors prefer to hold for further upside rather than cash in current gains – a trend that supports price stability.

Additionally, the amount of ETH staked has surged since May, hitting a record 36.2 million. This rise in validator deposits indicates growing long-term confidence in the network, reduces liquid supply, and adds bullish pressure.

With the Ethereum network booming, total transaction counts and active addresses have reached record highs of 1.7 million and 800,000, respectively, in August. Smart contract calls have also reached new levels, surpassing previous cycles with 12 million daily interactions.

CryptoQuant analysts say such activity growth highlights Ethereum's growing role as a programmable settlement layer supported by decentralized finance (DeFi) and asset tokenization.

Meanwhile, ETH currently faces resistance at $5,200, a realized price upper band that has remained a critical level in past cycles. A decisive breakout above this level would mark the onset of a strong bullish phase, while sustained consolidation below it could signal a cooling period.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","‘Failed altcoins' are confusing the treasury narrative: David Bailey","https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-treasury-narrative-confusion-nakamoto-david-bailey","Sun, 14 Sep 2025 07:57:46 GMT","

 Nakamoto CEO David Bailey says the digital asset treasury company “moniker itself is confusing,"" amid growing interest in balance sheet holdings beyond Bitcoin. 

Companies adding underperforming altcoins to their balance sheets are muddying the broader treasury narrative, says Bitcoin treasury company Nakamoto CEO, David Bailey.

“The treasury company moniker itself is confusing,” Bailey said in an X post on Sunday. 

“Toxic financing, failed altcoins rebranded as DATs, too many failed companies with no plan or vision. It's totally muddled the narrative,” Bailey said.

Bailey emphasized that “the core strategy is to build and monetize your balance sheet.”

“If you can do it well, you will grow your assets over time; if you do it poorly, you will trade at a discount and be consumed by someone who can do it better,” he said. 

Bailey said that the entire treasury sector is “being tested.” His comments come as publicly-listed companies are starting to look beyond Bitcoin (BTC) and down the risk curve for other crypto assets to add to their treasuries. On Aug. 2, it was reported that Nasdaq-listed Mill City Ventures III may raise another $500 million under an equity agreement to fund its recently announced Sui treasury strategy.

Narrative-driven theses are driving firms to expand their treasuries beyond Bitcoin, Galaxy Digital said in a July 31 report. Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP), BNB (BNB), and HyperLiquid (HYPE) are among the cryptocurrencies gaining traction outside of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin held in publicly-traded companies is approximately $117.91 billion at the time of publication, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET.

Ether is gaining traction as an alternative because it can also be staked for annual returns, making it a store of value and a source of income. Approximately 3.14% of Ether's total supply is held in publicly-listed treasury companies, according to StrategicETHReserve.

Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz said treasury companies showing interest in the broader crypto market may be the reason for Bitcoin's sideways price action in recent times. 

“Bitcoin's at a consolidation right now. Partly because you're seeing a lot of these treasury companies in other coins take their shot,” Novogratz said.

While altcoins in treasuries have faced some scrutiny, questions have also been raised about Bitcoin treasuries.

Venture capital firm Breed said only a few Bitcoin treasury companies will stand the test of time and avoid the vicious “death spiral” that will impact BTC holding companies that trade close to net asset value (NAV).

As September unfolds, the cryptocurrency market demonstrates a resurgence as Bitcoin and top altcoins turn green. For the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has seen a 1.1% rise and now trades at $112,260. Ethereum trades at $4,343.66, while XRP trades at $2.95, which is a 4.2% increase in the last 24 hours. This surge has renewed investors' interest and search for long-term mining opportunities, but the big question is: how, and which method can one use to attain a sustainable passive crypto income without speculative holding or buying tokens?



That's where a US-based cloud mining provider, FY Energy, is stepping in with green-powered and AI-optimized cloud mining power contracts as a better alternative to all investors. This opens a path to sustainable crypto mining, which eliminates the need for complex setups and removes the burden of owning or maintaining hardware, as well as freeing investors from market volatility.

In the past, mining was only possible for those willing to invest heavily in hardware, electricity, and maintenance. The traditional barriers are high, and profitability depends highly on the market's outlook, technical expertise, and stable energy access.

FY Energy has disrupted this traditional model of mining by offering investors cloud mining power contracts. Users can rent mining power right from their smartphones and start earning daily crypto income without managing any equipment, since FY Energy uses modern GPU machines, which ensure a seamless, profitable, and hands-off mining experience.

With blockchain innovation on the rise, FY Energy is among alternative investment platforms offering cloud mining power contracts. Users get to simply rent and start their cloud mining journey. FY Energy cloud mining contracts are flexible with payouts every 24 hours, and users can diversify their investment in different cryptocurrencies supported by the platform (BTC, DOGE, ETH, LTC), and also cash out rewards in XRP. And the best part is: profits are fixed, meaning your mining activities and rewards are not affected by the crypto market's price swings. Even better, new users are welcomed with a $20 trial plan, and contracts start from a minimum of $100. Using the live mining dashboard, track and manage your mining activities in real time.

To increase your earnings, take advantage of the platform's affiliate program, invite new users, and earn up to 8% in commissions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Top Altcoins to Buy Right Now as the Market Flips Bullish","https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-altcoins-to-buy-right-now-as-the-market-flips-bullish/","Sun, 14 Sep 2025 17:34:00 GMT","

As the crypto market shows new indications of bullish power, investors are once more eyeing the altcoin market for coins that possess true potential. While market leaders like XRP continue to hold firm in the spotlight, attention is next turning to fresh DeFi front-runners like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). 

Positioned at the intersection of decentralized lending, Mutuum Finance is taking center stage for its creative approach to liquidity and capital efficiency, areas that can set it alongside the altcoin adoption wave leaders of the future. As sentiment lifts across coins, interest around which altcoins to watch develops, and MUTM is a name that keeps popping up.

XRP is currently trading at $3.03, reflecting newfound energy after reclaiming the $3 level amid growing institutional inflows. Analysts note that if the token is able to remain supported above $2.90, it could attempt to make a push toward the $3.30–$3.50 region in the near term, though resistance at these points is constricted. While such momentum is a credit to XRP's position in recent market recovery, attention in the broader crypto market is also shifting toward newer DeFi projects such as Mutuum Finance. 

Mutuum Finance has already created significant traction in its current presale, with over 16,280 investors and more than $15.68 million raised as of now. Currently at Phase 6, tokens can be had for $0.035 each, with the price being raised to $0.06 upon launch. This tiered, structured price model embodies the project's incentive system, where early adopters are rewarded with maximum benefits for their early adoption.

Another prominent feature of the project is its dual lending model, which brings Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models together in a single environment. According to the Peer-to-Contract model, liquidity pools are controlled by smart contracts alone, and interest rates are adjusted automatically by supply and demand levels. The Peer-to-Peer alternative, however, allows borrowers and lenders to negotiate among themselves, either through the fixity or variability of interest rates. Both schemes are facilitated by way of smart contracts, allowing for an open and trustless process. For added assurance of reliability, the platform itself has already undergone thorough auditing, with its codebase being made available as open-source so that maximum transparency and security are assured.



Mutuum Finance's future strategy lies in long-term growth through staking reward potential, token buyback programs, and strategically made exchange listings, all designed to increase liquidity and strengthen real-world applications. In addition to this, the project is also rewarding early adoption through a $100,000 giveaway. The campaign provides several different entry options throughout presale, encouraging strong community participation.

As part of its broader ecosystem growth, Mutuum Finance is preparing to issue a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network. In contrast to algorithmic stablecoins, which have frequently failed during episodes of market volatility, Mutuum's stablecoin will be overcollateralized and non-algorithmic, and thus capable of maintaining its peg even during episodes of financial stress. The model relies on the deployment of unused collateral reserves, ensuring long-term stability alongside value preservation guarantees. This positions the stablecoin not just as a secure medium of exchange but also as a secure store of value in the Mutuum Finance platform.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly shaping up to be one of the top altcoins discussed as bullish sentiment creeps back into the market. More than $15.68M raised, 16,280+ investors registered, and Stage 6 tokens that cost $0.035 prior to the final launch price of $0.06, early bird investors are in for big upside. As XRP gains around $3.03, analysts see MUTM as the best DeFi play for investors seeking more growth potential. Become part of Stage 6 today and receive your tokens before the price goes up.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","These Are The Best Altcoins To Buy Now For The Highest Returns: Chainlink, Cardano, & Remittix","https://blockchainreporter.net/these-are-the-best-altcoins-to-buy-now-for-the-highest-returns-chainlink-cardano-remittix/","Sun, 14 Sep 2025 08:41:44 GMT","

Many investors are now looking for the best altcoins to buy now, and some of the top options are Chainlink (LINK), Cardano (ADA), and the rising star Remittix (RTX). With its strong fundamentals and groundbreaking developments, Remittix is the top choice as the best altcoin to buy now.

Currently priced at $25.27, LINK has seen a surge in investor confidence after surpassing a major milestone in total value secured (TVS), which has now crossed $100 billion across decentralized finance platforms. According to DeFiLlama, lending giant Aave contributes the largest share of this TVS, holding over $70.9 billion, accounting for 70.75% market dominance. 

From a technical standpoint, Chainlink has found strong support at $21, where key indicators like the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, Bollinger Bands midpoint, and value area high align perfectly. Analysts predict that maintaining this price could cause an increase to $26 and maybe $30. Clearing the $29 resistance could be the next major step in confirming extended upward momentum.

Currently trading around $0.947, ADA's recent price movement hints at the possibility of a larger wave five rally that could push it past the $1 mark. Analyst Quinten recently shared a chart showing that Cardano has been following a five-wave price pattern since its June low of $0.511. According to his analysis, ADA is nearing the end of its fourth wave. A confirmed breakout would kickstart the fifth wave, potentially sending the price soaring.

source: itsquintn on TradingView

Bullish predictions for Cardano are growing, with Lark Davies projecting a rally to $1.20 based on a bullish pennant breakout. Meanwhile, Bitcoinsensus analysts have set their target slightly higher, at $1.860. Adding to this, data revealed that Cardano whales have purchased over 20 million ADA tokens in the past 24 hours, signaling renewed confidence.

Remittix is quickly emerging as the best altcoin to buy now, thanks to its unique use case and impressive growth. It has already raised over $25.5 million, selling more than 661 million RTX tokens at $0.1080 each.

The project also has its first CEX listings on BitMart and LBANK. One of the most exciting features of Remittix is its Beta Wallet, set to launch on September 15th, 2025, which will give users a first-hand experience of how seamless and efficient RTX-powered transfers will be.

Remittix also has a 15% referral reward program. This unique incentive not only encourages community growth but also gives participants a way to increase their holdings at no extra cost.

Here's why Remittix stands out:

For investors seeking the best altcoins to buy now, Chainlink, Cardano, and Remittix present three very different but highly promising paths to profit. However, of the three, Remittix has a better chance of becoming the next 100x crypto.

 Football's transfer system is plagued by delays and barriers. Blockchain technology offers faster settlements and global market access. 

Opinion by: Przemysław Kral, CEO of zondacrypto

The football transfer market has long been seen as a world of discrete backroom deals and negotiations. The transfer window brings immense excitement to supporters wanting to see how clubs prepare for the season ahead. 

It's not always smooth sailing, given the huge capital requirements and tight deadlines the clubs face to complete the deals. There is an option that could overcome these issues.The answer has come to the fore in recent years, and the football industry is beginning to embrace it.

Football has become a great partner to the crypto industry, with a rapid increase in sponsorship deals with football clubs making up 43% of all crypto sports sponsorships in the last year, roughly valued at $213 million, according to SportQuake. 

There is an opportunity for clubs to take these partnerships even further by integrating blockchain technology into their financial systems to increase transparency and democratize access to the transfer market. 

This isn't an entirely foreign concept in football transfers. In 2018, cryptocurrency was first used for a transfer when Ömer Faruk Kiroğlu was bought by Harunustaspor for a fee partially paid in Bitcoin. Several transfers have since been completed by major clubs worldwide, including Inter de Madrid, São Paulo FC and Raków Częstochowa.

These transfers were all completed with reduced settlement times and bypassed numerous cross-border payments that could have stunted the transactions. The process is becoming simpler with the development of more efficient and regulated crypto-native payment rails. 

The advantages don't only apply to clubs — governing bodies, including UEFA, could also leverage regulated crypto payment rails to automate the release of performance-based rewards should clubs qualify for the Champions League.

Player transfers require vast amounts of capital; not only are the initial fees and add-ons in the multi-millions, but the settlement and transaction fees for cross-border payments often mean that lower league clubs struggle with access to the global market. 

An early example was when São Paulo FC wanted to buy Giuliano Galoppo from Argentine side Banfield Athletic Club. Still, the sale was in trouble due to the turbulent Argentine FX market. This necessitated stablecoins, which São Paulo FC used to complete the transfer for a fee valued between $6 and $8 million in USDC. 

While the transfer was later subject to Argentine export regulation, leading to the advantage gained by using crypto being negated, the example highlights the potential for blockchain technology to provide a fixed and reliable value amid turbulent financial markets. 

As the economic world of football continues to expand globally, systematic modernization through a regulated, blockchain-powered framework could be the key to ensuring all clubs, regardless of size, market and location, have an equal opportunity to participate in the transfer market.

“Deadline Day” is the term used for the final day of the football transfer window, where clubs frantically attempt to finalize deals, often at the mercy of technology and bureaucracy. In 2015, a faulty fax machine thwarted former Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea's move to Real Madrid.

Related: The playbook for bringing millions of football fans to Web3

Cross-border payments between teams in different countries can take days (or sometimes weeks) to settle, creating a bottleneck that can hinder a transfer or risk clubs missing crucial deadlines. Bringing regulated crypto rails into play can allow transactions to be completed in minutes, highlighting the potential to de-escalate the hectic nature of deadline day.

The implications of introducing blockchain technology to the football transfer market go beyond beating the deadline day clock. Smaller clubs in emerging markets could benefit by democratizing access to faster, cheaper and more efficient rails. The worries of elongated settled times that risk jeopardizing crucial deals are minimized significantly, empowering teams to participate effectively in the global market and attract key talent. 

Beyond democratizing access, crypto and blockchain could have a positive role in profit and sustainability rules or financial fair play. These rules aim to level the playing field in the transfer market but the penalties clubs face, such as point deductions, can be devastating to their seasons and supporters. 

Blockchain technology could help boost transparency and make football transfers more equitable and seamless. By creating a so-called “Financial Fair Play Ledger” with all transfers and relevant financials onchain, transparency would be increased exponentially, and clubs would avoid falling prey to these rules and unnecessary penalties. 

Those cases are incidental, though; there's a much wider field of opportunity here. Crypto payment rails can solve the most significant issues affecting the football transfer market by creating an overarching, regulated transfer market onchain. This could ensure clubs adhere to profit and sustainability rules more efficiently, enable smaller clubs to access the broader transfer market by slashing cross-border exchange fees, and overcome deadline day chaos by reducing transfer settlement times. 

With more clubs embracing crypto sponsorship, there's a significant opportunity for governing bodies to officially endorse blockchain technology and join them onchain. There is real potential for blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to be leveraged as tools for more efficient (and cheaper) cross-border football transfers, leading to a positive, industry-wide impact on club finances, income sources and spending activities. For now, crypto is making its mark in the world of football and sport, through sponsorship, but also, increasingly, one lightning-fast transaction at a time.

While market analysts debate whether Solana price prediction models support a genuine challenge to Ethereum's dominance, a revolutionary Layer 2 blockchain called Layer Brett is quietly building the infrastructure that could render this debate obsolete. The question isn't whether SOL can dethrone Ethereum, but whether both will face disruption from next-generation solutions that combine meme culture with superior Layer 2 technology. 

Layer Brett's presale has already raised over $3.5 million, offering early investors the chance to stake $LBRETT tokens at an extraordinary 700+% APY while positioning for potential 100x gains.

Recent Solana price prediction models paint an optimistic picture, with some analysts projecting SOL could reach $1,314 following current breakout patterns. Galaxy Digital's massive $700 million accumulation demonstrates institutional confidence, while SOL trades near $240 with consistent 5-6% gains. However, these bullish signals mask fundamental limitations that constrain long-term growth potential.

SOL's network congestion issues during high-demand periods expose scalability challenges that institutional adoption will only amplify. While Galaxy's CEO calls Solana “tailor-made” for financial markets, the reality is that even optimistic Solana price prediction scenarios struggle to account for the technical debt accumulating as transaction volume increases.

The Ethereum ecosystem's entrenchment presents SOL with a challenge that transcends mere technical specifications. Despite Solana's speed advantages, Ethereum's developer ecosystem, institutional partnerships, and protocol maturity create switching costs that even the most bullish Solana price prediction cannot overcome through price appreciation alone.

Forward Industries' $1.65 billion raise supporting Galaxy's SOL accumulation reflects confidence in Solana's current trajectory, but institutional money follows infrastructure stability over revolutionary potential. Layer Brett recognizes this dynamic by building on Ethereum's foundation while delivering the speed and cost advantages that make SOL attractive to traders seeking alternatives.

While SOL and Ethereum compete for market share in an increasingly saturated Layer 1 landscape, Layer Brett represents the next evolutionary step: a Layer 2 blockchain that inherits Ethereum's security while delivering transaction speeds that surpass Solana's capabilities. The project's unique positioning as both a memecoin and serious infrastructure play creates asymmetric upside that traditional Solana price prediction models cannot match.

Early $LBRETT investors can stake tokens immediately at 700+% APY, generating passive income while participating in Layer Brett's ecosystem development. Where SOL targets institutions and Ethereum brings complexity, Layer Brett merges grassroots meme culture with real Layer 2 functionality—producing viral momentum that legacy networks find impossible to recreate.

Through its $1 million giveaway campaign, Layer Brett further showcases dedication to fostering community bonds, and by maintaining a decentralized structure with zero KYC requirements, it delivers the accessibility that corporate-minded platforms like SOL simply can't match.

The Solana price prediction debate ultimately misses the larger narrative: the future belongs to Layer 2 solutions that solve scalability without sacrificing security or decentralization. While SOL may achieve short-term price targets, Layer Brett's combination of Ethereum security, superior speed, and community-driven growth creates the mathematical foundation for sustained exponential returns. 

Smart money is gravitating toward presale opportunities that offer both immediate staking rewards and long-term infrastructure positioning before mainstream adoption makes early entry impossible.

A key feature of the game is its player-driven economy. Crops, resources, and characters all possess value, with players able to trade and interact through marketplaces. Every decision, from farming to forging alliances, contributes to the evolving shared universe.

The game is known for its high-quality visuals and seamless blockchain integration, instilling a sense of pride among players for their game choice. With features like Auto Farm, BLOCKLORDS continues to refine the balance between resource management and large-scale empire building.

Has the world gone crazy?

Welcome to the crazy world of NFTs if you have not heard about it.

NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, represent a new class of digital assets that are fundamentally different from fungible tokens such as Bitcoin. We have previously explored the concept of Bitcoin and its role as a decentralized currency.

It is important to understand the economic principle that separates these cryptos like bitcoin and NFTs: fungibility.

Fungibility is a defining characteristic of sound money. It refers to the property by which each unit of an asset is perfectly interchangeable with any other unit of the same type, without any difference in value or function. For instance, if one were to hand over a $100 bill and receive another $100 bill in return, the transaction would leave both parties unchanged in terms of value. It is irrelevant to see which specific note is held; all $100 bills are identical in worth. This principle extends further: one $100 bill is equally interchangeable with two $50 bills or ten $10 bills. The same principle applies in financial markets.

Consider Apple stock (AAPL). If one investor owns a single share of AAPL and another investor holds a single share as well, those shares are identical in terms of ownership rights, dividends, and voting power. No share of a particular class of stock carries special privileges over another. Thus, shares of the same class within a company are also fungible.

Non-fungible means that each item is unique and not interchangeable on a one-to-one basis, even if they look similar. Key non fungible examples in the real world are real estate like houses. Even if two houses are both “3-bedroom, 2-bath,” they're not identical. Location, neighborhood, view, and condition all make one house different in value from another. You can't just swap two houses and say the exchange is perfectly fair without negotiation.

Collectibles like Baseball Cards, Stamps and art are another example. A Babe Ruth rookie card is not the same as a random rookie card from another player. Even if two cards show the same player, conditions like mint vs. worn make them different. Each piece of art by Picasso or Van Gogh is unique and valued individually.

Baseball cards have long held a cherished place in American culture, blending sports fandom with the thrill of collecting. The tradition dates back to the late 19th century, when tobacco companies began inserting cards featuring baseball players into their products as promotional items. Over time, these cards became highly sought after collectibles, sparking a robust secondary market where rarity, player popularity, and card condition determined value.

By the mid-20th century, companies such as Topps dominated the baseball card industry, producing annual sets that enthusiasts eagerly pursued. The culture of trading cards on playgrounds, at local hobby shops, and later at large conventions, created a vibrant community of collectors. However, with the growth of this market came persistent challenges. Counterfeiting became increasingly sophisticated, and disputes over authenticity and condition frequently arose. Collectors often relied on third party grading services to certify a card's legitimacy and quality, but even these systems were not immune to manipulation, human error, or bias. Stories of doctored cards, forged signatures, and tampered packaging highlighted the vulnerabilities in the physical trading space.

The global sports trading card market size was approximately $11.5 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach around $52 billion by 2034, according to market reports from March 2025 with a projected CAGR between of 8%. These figures encompass the entire sports trading card industry, not just baseball cards. Collectors Inc, is a global leader in the collectibles industry, providing authentication, grading, and management services and it was valued at four billion dollars in 2022.

With the innovation of bitcoin, it was possible to send value over the wire without a trusted middleman. It opened up the possibility of trading digital art over the wire via smart contracts. Digital art was not a scarce commodity. Prior to blockchains and bitcoins, every digital art or image you send over the network, the receiver could copy and forward it again. And there was no difference in the original and the each forwarded and copied image. Artists had a problem of establishing verifiable ownership of digital works. Also artists or creators generally had no more revenue share in their works after their first sale. NFTs and smart contracts just changed the whole industry of digital arts and memes.

The honor of being called the first NFT generally goes to “Quantum”, a digital artwork created in May 2014 by Kevin McCoy, a digital artist, and Anil Dash, a technologist. It was a pixelated, pulsing octagon animation that McCoy registered on the Namecoin blockchain. Although the technology at the time was rudimentary compared to modern blockchains like Ethereum, Quantum pioneered the concept of provenance and uniqueness in digital assets. It set the foundation for what would later explode into the NFT ecosystem.

Ethereum and its ERC-721 standards emerged in 2017 and changed the whole game of NFTs giving rise to projects such as CryptoPunks and CryptoKitties, which popularized NFTs to a broader audience.

CryptoPunks was launched in June 2017 by Larva Labs, a creative studio founded by Canadian software developers Matt Hall and John Watkinson. Inspired by the punk movement and cyberpunk aesthetics, they generated 10,000 unique 24×24 pixel art characters using an algorithm. Each “punk” was a small, digital portrait: humans, zombies, apes, and aliens with randomized attributes like hairstyles, hats, and accessories. These tokens were released for free: anyone with an Ethereum wallet could claim a Punk. At the time, Ethereum's ERC-721 standard for NFTs hadn't even been finalized, so CryptoPunks operated on a custom smart contract that essentially pioneered the NFT concept on Ethereum.

In the early years (2017–2019), CryptoPunks traded modestly, often for a few dollars or fractions of an ETH. As NFTs exploded in 2020–2021, CryptoPunks became the definitive “OG” NFT project, valued for being both historically important and culturally iconic. By 2021, during the NFT boom, prices skyrocketed: Common Punks routinely sold for six figures in USD, the Rare Alien, Ape, and Zombie Punks reached multimillion-dollar sales. One Alien Punk (#5822) sold for 8,000 ETH (~$23.7 million) in February 2022—among the highest NFT sales ever. CryptoPunks became a status symbol, with celebrities like Jay-Z, Serena Williams, etc.. purchasing and displaying them as profile pictures. Initially, Larva Labs managed the project, but in March 2022, they sold the intellectual property rights of CryptoPunks (and their later project, Meebits) to Yuga Labs, the creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club.

CryptoPunks remain one of the most valuable and recognizable NFT collections. Floor prices, the lowest price for a Punk fluctuate with broader crypto and NFT market cycles, but as of 2025, they still command tens of thousands of dollars minimum. They are increasingly seen as digital artifacts or “historical NFTs,” valued not just for rarity but for their pioneering role in NFT history.

CryptoKitties was launched in November 2017 by the Canadian startup Axiom Zen, a venture studio based in Vancouver. The game was later spun out into a separate company called Dapper Labs. CryptoKitties was one of the first blockchain games and a defining moment for NFTs. Players could purchase, collect, breed, and trade digital cats, each represented as a unique NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. Each cat had distinct traits (“cattributes”) such as fur color, eye shape, and patterns, determined algorithmically. Unlike fungible tokens like Bitcoin or Ether, each CryptoKitty was unique, embodying the concept of non-fungibility in a playful and accessible way. CryptoKitties became so popular that it congested the Ethereum network, slowing transactions and highlighting scalability issues.

Early adopters paid anywhere from a few dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars for rare cats. The most expensive sale at the time was “Dragon,” a CryptoKitty that sold for 600 ETH (≈ $170,000 in 2018). Breeding rare traits became a speculative frenzy, with some collectors treating cats as investments while others enjoyed the game-like aspect. CryptoKitties demonstrated the fun, gamified side of blockchain, introducing thousands of people to Ethereum who might never have engaged with it otherwise.

Dapper Labs went on to develop Flow Blockchain, a more scalable blockchain designed for NFTs and gaming and partnered with the NBA to launch NBA Top Shot, which became a mainstream NFT success in 2020–2021. Dapper Labs raised hundreds of millions in venture funding and became one of the most recognized names in the NFT space. After the initial hype, CryptoKitties' popularity declined as novelty wore off and newer NFT projects emerged. The game still exists, but its player base is much smaller.

Dapper Labs shifted focus to larger-scale projects like NBA Top Shot, NFL All Day, and the broader Flow ecosystem. Despite fading from mainstream attention, CryptoKitties retains historical significance as one of the first viral NFT projects, proving that blockchain could power consumer entertainment at scale. The legacy is that CryptoKitties Introduced NFTs to the world in a fun, gamified way, Exposed Ethereum's scalability limits, sparking innovation in blockchain infrastructure and laid the foundation for Dapper Labs' rise, leading to Flow and major sports partnerships.

NBA Top Shot was launched in October 2020 by Dapper Labs, the team behind CryptoKitties, in partnership with the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the NBA Players Association (NBPA). Built on Dapper's nft purpose built Flow blockchain. NBA Top Shot became the first NFT project to reach mainstream popularity. By March 2021, sales were surging, with daily transactions exceeding $10 million at peak. Total sales volume surpassed $200 million in February 2021 alone. Within its first year, NBA Top Shot generated over $700 million in marketplace transactions across hundreds of thousands of users. Some individual Moments sold for six figures, such as a LeBron James dunk that went for over $200,000. While NBA Top Shot was a cultural phenomenon in early 2021, momentum slowed by late 2022 as the wider NFT market cooled. Secondary market prices for many Moments dropped significantly as supply expanded and speculative demand receded.

NBA Top Shot introduced hundreds of thousands of first-time NFT users, many of whom had never interacted with blockchain before. Its success encouraged other leagues to explore NFTs, including the NFL (“NFL All Day”), UFC (“Strike”), and Major League Baseball. The NBA and NBPA benefited from licensing fees and royalties on every transaction, showing how sports organizations could monetize digital fandom at scale.

OpenSea, founded in 2017 by Alex Atallah and Devin Finzer, quickly became the dominant marketplace for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Inspired by the success of early blockchain projects like CryptoKitties, the platform set out to be the “eBay of NFTs,” offering a venue where creators and collectors could mint, buy, and sell unique digital assets ranging from art and music to in-game items and domain names. By lowering barriers to entry and supporting multiple NFT standards such as ERC-721 and ERC-1155, OpenSea became the default gateway to the NFT ecosystem. The platform's growth exploded during the NFT boom of 2020–2021. Monthly trading volumes surged from a few million dollars in early 2020 to billions by mid-2021.

In August 2021, OpenSea recorded more than $3.4 billion in transaction volume in a single month, making it one of the fastest-growing startups in the world. This surge was fueled by projects such as CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, and Art Blocks, which became cultural phenomena and cemented OpenSea's role at the center of digital culture. Investor enthusiasm mirrored this meteoric rise.

In January 2022, OpenSea closed a funding round led by Paradigm and Coatue that valued the company at $13.3 billion, making it one of the most valuable private crypto firms globally. The round reflected both investor confidence in NFTs as an emerging asset class and OpenSea's commanding market share and at one point exceeding 90 percent of all NFT marketplace transactions. Despite its dominance, OpenSea has faced challenges. Technical glitches, customer service complaints, and controversies around insider trading and stolen NFTs have raised questions about oversight and trust. Competition also intensified with the rise of marketplaces like LooksRare, Blur, and Magic Eden, which sought to attract traders through lower fees, reward systems, or specialized community features. Market downturns in 2022–2023 reduced trading volumes dramatically, testing the resilience of both OpenSea and the broader NFT ecosystem. Today, OpenSea remains a leading NFT exchange, though its position is less absolute than during its peak. Its legacy lies in having provided the infrastructure for an entirely new digital economy, one where ownership, creativity, and speculation intersect.

NFT.NYC founded by Jodee Rich is one of the world's largest and most influential conferences dedicated to NFTs and the broader Web3 ecosystem. First held in 2019 in New York City with less than 300 people attending, it quickly became a flagship event, attracting artists, developers, investors, and major brands exploring the future of digital ownership. Known for its high-energy atmosphere and diverse programming, NFT.NYC features panels, workshops, and exhibitions covering art, gaming, collectibles, and decentralized finance. At its peak in 2021 and 2022, the conference drew twenty thousands of attendees at an average ticket price of a thousand 1,000 dollars and served as a cultural hub where partnerships were forged and projects debuted. Today, it continues to symbolize the mainstreaming of NFTs, blending industry thought leadership with community-driven creativity.

The NFT ecosystem is far from dead. In fact, it continues to show growth and resilience. The global NFT market is valued around US $49 billion in 2025, up from approximately $36 billion in 2024.

In just the first quarter of 2025, global NFT sales exceeded US $8.2 billion. The average sale price for NFTs has leveled off at around US $940, signaling more mature, deliberate buying behavior. Daily active NFT wallets now average around 410,000, a 9% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the total number of NFT users is estimated at about 11.6 million worldwide, up from 10.2 million in 2023.

NFTs once offered a flashy playground for celebrities, but many projects have since faded. Donald Trump has released several branded NFT collections, like superhero-style trading cards but they've been controversial. One release even restricted resale until January 31, 2025, and raised concerns over licensing and campaign funding. Shakira debuted La Caldera, a four-piece digital art collection created with BossLogic. Prices ranged from 0.6 ETH (~$935) up to 20 ETH (~$61,000). Proceeds supported her foundation and sustainability efforts. Projects like “Stoner Cats”, backed by Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, have run afoul of regulators. The NFT-funded animated series was fined US $1 million by the SEC for conducting an unregistered securities offering.

From the start, brands saw NFTs not only as digital collectibles but also as a way to reinvent loyalty programs. Unlike traditional reward points, which are centralized, non-transferable, and often forgotten by customers, NFTs promised programmable, tradable, and status-driven loyalty assets. The pitch was simple: make points feel like property, not coupons. A loyalty NFT sits in a customer's wallet, not on a brand's server, creating a stronger sense of control. Unlike traditional points, NFTs can be sold, gifted, or traded—adding real value and liquidity. Certain NFTs grant access to exclusive clubs, events, or perks, turning loyalty into social currency. Smart contracts allow brands to design tiered rewards, limited-edition perks, or gamified experiences.

Starbucks launched “Odyssey,” an NFT-based extension of its Rewards program on the Polygon blockchain. The project initially drew buzz but was shut down in 2024 due to shifting corporate priorities and waning user engagement.

Nike acquired RTFKT Studios, creators of virtual sneakers and avatars, in 2021. Adidas partnered with Bored Ape Yacht Club, Punks Comics, and Gmoney for its NFT launch in 2021. Holders received access to exclusive merchandise and virtual experiences. The project showed strong early traction but has since slowed, mirroring the wider NFT market correction. Their “CryptoKicks” NFTs allowed users to own and even “breed” digital sneakers, blending fashion, gaming, and status.

Brands like Gucci and Louis Vuitton tested NFT drops linked to VIP access and fashion items. Hotels and airlines experimented with NFT passes for priority upgrades and event access, though few scaled. A ton of marketing research can be done on loyalty, tokenomics, speculation with regards to NFTs and crypto airdrops like Do tokenized loyalty programs increase engagement, trust, and customer value relative to traditional points-based programs?

The rules of how artists or creators of art are incentivized or paid have changed with NFTs. The project can be built in such a way that every sale can have a small percentage sent to the original artist. Even if initially the NFTs were sold at a very low price, as long as the community likes it and trades it, the original creator can be acknowledged and compensated with every sale. You cannot do that in traditional art. When Jeff Koons – Rabbit (1986, sculpture) was sold for the highest auction record for a living artist at approximately $91.1 million, sold in 2019, the original sculptor need not get anything off of it.

The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), created by Yuga Labs in April 2021, is one of the most recognizable and influential NFT collections. Comprising 10,000 algorithmically generated cartoon apes with unique traits, BAYC quickly transcended digital art to become a cultural phenomenon. Ownership granted not just profile-picture bragging rights, but also membership in an exclusive community, complete with private events, merchandise, and additional NFT airdrops like Mutant Apes and Kennel Club. Prices for Bored Apes soared during the NFT boom of 2021–2022, with rare apes selling for millions of dollars and celebrities such as Eminem, Steph Curry, and Paris Hilton joining the club. Today, BAYC remains a “blue-chip” NFT project, symbolizing both the hype and staying power of the Web3 movement.

Among them, one ape (Bored Ape #1798) had a brown fur coat, a striped shirt, a fisherman's cap, and a world-weary look. Two BAYC community members, Safa and Valet Jones, purchased this ape and decided to give it a personality. They named him Jenkins the Valet, imagining him as the Yacht Club's parking attendant and storyteller. The idea was that Jenkins had “seen it all” at the BAYC and could narrate tales about the community's characters.

Amid this community, Jenkins the Valet emerged as a storytelling experiment that highlighted how NFTs could extend beyond static art into media franchises. Jenkins was a fictional character, represented by a single Bored Ape, who served as a valet parking attendant for the Yacht Club. The creators built an entire narrative universe around him, securing representation with Creative Artists Agency (CAA) and planning books and other media projects. Holders of related NFTs, called the Writer's Room, were given a say in shaping Jenkins' stories, blending decentralized ownership with collaborative creative production. While the initial buzz cooled as the broader NFT market slowed, Jenkins the Valet remains a case study in how NFTs can evolve into participatory intellectual property turning a single cartoon ape into a character with narrative, commercial, and cultural potential.

Maybe one of you reading this might be able to create a character collection and build a universe with amazing story telling around it.

Home - Crypto Presales - From Forex Giant to Crypto ICO Leader: Vortex FX 1,500 Daily Trades Power VFX Token Value

Every 58 seconds, Vortex FX executes another trade. By the time you finish reading this article, the platform will have processed over $400,000 in trading volume. This isn't hypothetical – it's happening right now, 24/7, generating real profits that power VFX Token's (VFX) unprecedented 67.7% APY rewards.

Vortex FX didn't start as a crypto project seeking purpose. It began as a licensed forex and commodities trading firm that recognized blockchain's potential. With 1,500+ lots traded daily across forex, gold, and cryptocurrency markets, the platform processes more volume than most DeFi protocols dream of achieving.

The infrastructure is staggering:

This isn't a platform hoping for adoption—it's an established operation expanding into tokenization.

The genius of VFX Token lies in bridging two worlds. Traditional forex traders get blockchain benefits: transparent execution, reduced fees, and tokenized profit-sharing. Crypto natives access institutional-grade trading tools previously reserved for hedge funds and banks.

Every trade executed on Vortex FX generates rebates. With $7.50 per lot and 1,500 daily lots, that's $11,250 in daily rebates – $225,000 monthly, $2.7 million annually. These aren't projections or best-case scenarios; they're current operational metrics. Half of these rebates fund VFX Token staking rewards, creating sustainable 67.7% APY without token inflation.

While meme coins attract retail gamblers, VFX Token attracts professional traders who understand value. The platform's MetaTrader 5 integration, algorithmic trading support, and professional-grade analytics attract serious capital. These aren't investors buying lottery tickets – they're professionals recognizing arbitrage.

Recent testimonials from platform users reveal the advantage: “I've traded forex for 15 years. Vortex FX offers spreads starting at 0.0 pips with no requotes. The VFX Token is just a bonus value on an already superior platform.” When career traders endorse a platform, smart money follows.

Vortex FX's transformation from regional broker to global crypto pioneer follows a proven playbook. Binance started as a small exchange. Coinbase began serving one country. The difference? VFX Token launches with established operations, regulatory compliance, and profitable business model intact.

The Visa and Mastercard integration alone sets VFX apart. While competitors promise future payment solutions, Vortex FX users already convert trading profits to spendable currency instantly. The cards aren't “coming soon” – they're processing transactions today.

Each new VFX Token holder potentially becomes a platform trader. Each platform trader generates more volume. More volume creates higher rebates. Higher rebates fund bigger staking rewards. Bigger rewards attract more holders. The cycle accelerates.

At $0.06 current price, early investors position before this flywheel gains momentum. Once institutional traders discover they can earn 67.7% APY on top of their trading profits, the capital rotation will be massive. Forex markets dwarf crypto – even 1% of forex traders adopting VFX Token would create explosive growth.

The transition from forex giant to crypto leader isn't a pivot – it's an evolution. Vortex FX spent years building the infrastructure, establishing the licenses, and growing the user base. VFX Token simply tokenizes access to this profit machine.

Information Commissioner Jason Outerbridge issued Decision 15/2025 regarding the Bermuda Monetary Authority.

A spokesperson said, “On 5 September 2025, Information Commissioner Jason Outerbridge issued Decision 15/2025, Bermuda Monetary Authority, which reviewed the BMA's refusal to disclose records related to a regulated fund. The BMA's internal review decision stated that the BMA was prohibited from disclosing the records because of the secrecy provision contained in the BMA Act 1969. The provision mandates the BMA to preserve the secrecy of all matters relating to the affairs of the Government, the BMA or any person that comes to the BMA's knowledge in the course of its duties. During the Commissioner's review, the BMA confirmed that records responsive to the request existed but maintained that they were exempt from disclosure under the PATI Act.



“The Information Commissioner upheld the BMA's decision, finding that disclosure of the records was prohibited under the BMA's secrecy provision as the records related to a legal person and came to the knowledge of the BMA in the course of its duties to supervise, regulate and inspect the relevant fund. Although the Applicant argued that the BMA's secrecy provision permitted the BMA to disclose information to the Minister of Finance and the Registrar of Companies under certain limited circumstances [e.g. where it was in the public interest or required for the Minister's oversight responsibilities], the Information Commissioner found that these gateways to disclosure were discretionary to the BMA and the oversight of the exercise or non-exercise of that discretion was outside the limited jurisdiction of the Information Commissioner under the PATI Act.”

KARACHI: Pakistan cannot regulate cryptocurrencies within its current financial system, as the State Bank tightly manages foreign exchange, but virtual assets may still serve as an alternative to hawala, said former Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) chairman and economist Shabbar Zaidi.

Speaking at a session on Adopting Digital Currency and Cryptocurrency in Pakistan: Possibilities and Concerns, organised by the Pakistan Institute of International Affairs (PIIA) on Saturday, Mr Zaidi outlined the risks and opportunities surrounding digital currencies.

He said a law enabling cryptocurrency regulation has been passed and is under discussion in parliament. However, he stressed that digital or virtual currencies, by design, are difficult to regulate.

“Cryptocurrencies flourish because they leave no trail. A currency born unregulated cannot be regulated,” he argued. While the US market has seen widespread adoption, he noted, the difference lies in the freer foreign exchange regime. In Pakistan, commercial banks cannot buy and sell dollars without the State Bank's permission.

Says Pakistan cannot regulate virtual currencies under current system; nearly 9m Pakistanis hold digital assets

Trust and acceptance

Mr Zaidi estimated that around nine million Pakistanis hold or trade virtual currencies, primarily Bitcoin, a decentralised digital asset where transactions are recorded on a blockchain and issuance is independent of any central bank.

 
 


He added that digital currencies are already being used to settle transactions, including under-invoicing in trade with China, in ways similar to the hawala system. “This is not about being too fast or too slow in adoption. The reality is that our system cannot regulate it,” he said.

He emphasised that all currencies are built on trust, pointing to the US dollar today and the British pound in the past. Similarly, a trusted digital currency could emerge as a medium of payment worldwide.

He suggested that asset-backed cryptocurrencies could, in theory, be issued, but demand would remain weak since unregulated digital assets allow holders to convert black money into white.

Citing examples abroad, he noted that India had formally rejected cryptocurrencies, while in the US, they continue to grow in popularity.

He also linked cryptocurrencies to political debates in the US, claiming that former president Donald Trump's administration supported them after facing resistance from the Federal Reserve. Mr Zaidi quoted a banker as saying the Trump family earned $2.4bn through virtual currencies during their time in office.

Digitisation versus crypto

While acknowledging Pakistan's progress in digitising its financial system, Mr Zaidi underlined that crypto belongs to a different domain.

“Digitisation is about documentation and traceability. Crypto thrives on the opposite — anonymity and lack of control,” he said.

Experts at the session noted that the use of virtual currencies in Pakistan is likely to continue growing, particularly as tight foreign exchange controls limit other avenues for cross-border payments.

In a move that could significantly reshape the digital currency landscape, Tether has unveiled plans for USA₮, a new U.S.-regulated stablecoin. This initiative aims to reinforce the dollar's position as the dominant currency in digital assets. Tether, already a major player in the cryptocurrency market, has appointed Bo Hines, a former White House crypto adviser, to lead this new venture. The USA₮ stablecoin will comply with the GENIUS Act, aligning it with new U.S. regulatory standards. This development underscores Tether's commitment to transparency and innovation, potentially setting a new benchmark for compliance in the rapidly evolving world of digital finance.

The appointment of Bo Hines as CEO of Tether USA₮ marks a significant step in the integration of regulatory compliance and innovation in the stablecoin sector. Hines, who previously served as Executive Director of the White House Crypto Council, brings a wealth of experience in business, law, and government to his new role. His leadership is expected to align USA₮ with American regulatory priorities, ensuring that the stablecoin operates within the legal frameworks set by the U.S. government.

Hines expressed his enthusiasm for the project, stating, “By building USA₮ with compliance, transparency, and innovation at its core, we are ensuring that the dollar remains the foundation of trust in the digital asset space.” This sentiment highlights the strategic importance of the USA₮ initiative, not only for Tether but also for reinforcing the dollar's strength in the global economy.

With U.S.-based leadership, Tether aims to address regulatory concerns and foster trust among users and stakeholders. The company believes that Hines's appointment will enhance its ability to navigate the complex regulatory landscape and strengthen its position as a leader in the digital currency market.

“Elon Musk Faces Digital Wrath”: Anonymous Strikes Back with Vengeance in This Explosive Cyber Assault That Shakes the Tech World



Building on the success of USD₮, Tether's most widely used stablecoin, the launch of USA₮ represents a strategic expansion of Tether's influence in the digital currency market. USD₮ boasts a market capitalization exceeding $169 billion, with daily transactions surpassing those of some leading payment firms. This widespread adoption, particularly in emerging markets, underscores the trust and reliability that Tether has established among its users.

In addition to its market dominance, Tether has become one of the most profitable companies in the digital asset sector. The firm reported earnings exceeding $13 billion in 2024 and anticipates similar financial performance in 2025. Tether's position as the 18th largest holder of U.S. Treasuries further cements its role as a significant player in the global financial ecosystem.

Through the introduction of USA₮, Tether seeks to offer institutions and businesses a regulated alternative to cash and traditional financial systems. This initiative is framed as a “natural next step” in reinforcing the strength of the dollar in both domestic and international markets, providing a stable and reliable option for financial transactions.

USA₮ is set to comply with the GENIUS Act, the first major U.S. legislation governing stablecoin issuance. This compliance is crucial for establishing trust among users and regulatory bodies. Tether has partnered with Anchorage Digital, the country's only federally regulated crypto bank, to issue the token. Cantor Fitzgerald will serve as the reserve custodian and primary dealer, ensuring that USA₮ maintains transparent and secure reserves.

Tether's commitment to transparency is further emphasized by its platform, Hadron, which will tokenize real-world assets. This innovation aligns with U.S. financial rules, setting a benchmark for compliance in the stablecoin sector. Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, remarked on the project, stating, “USA₮ is our commitment to ensuring that the dollar not only remains dominant in the digital age, but thrives.”

This endeavor reflects Tether's confidence in the dollar and its ability to adapt to the evolving digital landscape. By emphasizing transparency, resilience, and accessibility, Tether aims to bolster the dollar's position in the digital economy, offering a stable and reliable currency for users worldwide.

The launch of USA₮ represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of digital currencies. As regulatory frameworks continue to develop, the role of stablecoins like USA₮ in the global financial system becomes increasingly significant. Tether's initiative highlights the importance of compliance and transparency in building trust among users and regulators.

With the digital currency landscape rapidly evolving, the introduction of USA₮ could pave the way for further innovations in the sector. As more companies and institutions explore the potential of digital assets, the need for regulated and reliable options becomes paramount. Tether's approach to integrating regulatory compliance with technological innovation sets a precedent for other players in the market.

As the digital economy continues to grow, the question remains: How will traditional financial systems adapt to the rise of regulated digital currencies like USA₮?

Bo Hines, from the White House to Tether? That's quite a move! What does this mean for the future of stablecoins?

Bo Hines seems like a great choice for CEO. But can he really balance innovation with compliance?

Are there any risks involved with launching such a massive stablecoin?

Why USA₮? The name sounds a bit confusing.

Pourquoi tout le monde parle de stablecoins maintenant? Je suis un peu perdu. 🤔

Compliance and transparency are key. I'm glad to see Tether focusing on these areas. 😊

Sounds promising! But how will this affect the value of USD₮?

Is this just another way for the US to maintain its dominance in the digital economy?

Who's this Bo Hines guy? Never heard of him before!

Isn't $169 billion a bit too ambitious? Sounds like a bubble waiting to pop!

As the world continues to embrace the digital revolution, people have been using advanced technologies to their advantage. From cloud computing to artificial intelligence, these tools are just among the many. With these technological advancements, businesses have shifted towards greater emphasis towards flexibility, efficiency, and collaboration. 

Aside from cloud computing and artificial intelligence, the digital age has also given us blockchain technology. Through this type of technology, people are able to enjoy cryptocurrency where transactions can be conducted securely and transparently without the need for intermediaries. Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrency allows users to bypass banking systems and conduct transactions directly with one another.

With how efficient this digital currency is, it is slowly being integrated into some of the daily activities of people. Currently, it is becoming big in the e-commerce and gaming industry as actors and stakeholders are growing more confident of its use in these industries. Most particularly, its growing use is mostly felt within the United States. 

As such, let us explore more of cryptocurrency and discover why more US consumers and gamers are using cryptocurrency. 

Who Uses Cryptocurrency? 

Cryptocurrency and other digital currencies are becoming part of the popular consciousness and are absolutely poised for further growth. Accordingly, cryptocurrency now has a diverse user base across various demographics and industries. Here are some of the key groups: 

The first one on the list is the gamers who are willing to use cryptocurrency at least in the payment methods for in-game purchases or even as a means to earn rewards. 

Accordingly, the use of cryptocurrency is even more pronounced in US casino gaming where real money is used in platforms that can be found in Michigan online casino to facilitate instant transactions and even enhance gamer anonymity. In the US alone, many gamers prefer to use cryptocurrency to further high-quality gaming experience along with fair and secure transactions. Why? Because gamers get to enjoy excellent gaming with lower fees and faster payouts providing an enjoyable experience for both casual and serious gamers. 

Considering that cryptocurrency runs on blockchain technology, it is impossible not to have the tech bros line up over cryptocurrency, just among the latest innovations in tech. 

In fact, cryptocurrency is said to be booming with Washington driving up the rally. Accordingly, it is climbing into high popularity as more and more investors continue to pour money into crypto-related companies and investments. 

As such, tech enthusiasts are eager to explore the potential of cryptocurrencies. Their enthusiasm drives them to participate in hackathons, forums, and even applications as to purchase and sale using cryptocurrency. With more industries adopting cryptocurrency, this furthers its hold over tech enthusiasts and generates a sense of community among those who share a passion for innovation. 

Cryptocurrency is also real popular among the privacy advocate sector. 

It is well known that one of the reasons why cryptocurrency became popular with the people is because of the heightened transactional privacy and security it offers. Considering that cryptocurrency runs on a digital ledger or a blockchain, it provides transparency in transactions while masking the identity of participants. 

This unique combination has attracted those who value both anonymity and integrity of their financial transactions. 

Lastly, we also have the investors who see cryptocurrency as a lucrative investment opportunity. 

While cryptocurrency has a volatile nature, it still continues to attract those looking to make significant returns, albeit with higher risks. Investors are drawn to potential gains, as well as the allure of diversifying their portfolios with assets that are not tied to traditional market fluctuations. 

As the industry matures, it will be interesting to observe how investors will take advantage of cryptocurrency as it continues to vie for attention in the global economy. 

Use of Cryptocurrency in Online Gaming 

While there are a lot of applications of cryptocurrency in various industries, the use of cryptocurrency is most well known within the online casino gaming industry. Here are some of the reasons why this digital currency has become intertwined with gaming: 

With cryptocurrencies, it will facilitate quick and easy transactions within casino gaming platforms. 

Considering that most casino gaming platforms host games that involve real money, the use of cryptocurrency enabled speed and convenient transactions for players, allowing them to deposit and withdraw funds almost instantaneously. 

Aside from seamless transactions, the use of cryptocurrency within the online casino gaming industry has also provided a level of security especially for gamers who often face the risk of fraud in online transactions. 

The blockchain technology underlying cryptocurrency ensures that transactions within the platform are secure and verifiable. 

Lastly, cryptocurrency allows the reach of casino games which are only available within the US to various parts of the world. 

Cryptocurrency eliminates the hassles associated with currency exchange. Accordingly, it allows casino gaming platforms broaden their reach without having their gamers worry about conversion fees and accessibility.

On Sept. 17, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) is widely expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, lowering the benchmark range to 4.00%-4.25%. This move will likely be followed by more easing in the coming months, taking the rates down to around 3% within the next 12 months. The fed funds futures market is discounting a drop in the fed funds rate to less than 3% by the end of 2026.

Bitcoin BTC$115,488.28 bulls are optimistic that the anticipated easing will push Treasury yields sharply lower, thereby encouraging increased risk-taking across both the economy and financial markets. However, the dynamics are more complex and could lead to outcomes that differ significantly from what is anticipated.

While the expected Fed rate cuts could weigh on the two-year Treasury yield, those at the long end of the curve may remain elevated due to fiscal concerns and sticky inflation.

The U.S. government is expected to increase the issuance of Treasury bills (short-term instruments) and eventually longer-duration Treasury notes to finance the Trump administration's recently approved package of extended tax cuts and increased defense spending. According to the Congressional Budget Office, these policies are likely to add over $2.4 trillion to primary deficits over ten years, while Increasing debt by nearly $3 trillion, or roughly $5 trillion if made permanent.

The increased supply of debt will likely weigh on bond prices and lift yields. (bond prices and yields move in the opposite direction).

""The U.S. Treasury's eventual move to issue more notes and bonds will pressure longer-term yields higher,"" analysts at T. Rowe Price, a global investment management firm, said in a recent report.

Fiscal concerns have already permeated the longer-duration Treasury notes, where investors are demanding higher yields to lend money to the government for 10 years or more, known as the term premium. 

The ongoing steepening of the yield curve – which is reflected in the widening spread between 10- and 2-year yields, as well as 30- and 5-year yields and driven primarily by the relative resilience of long-term rates – also signals increasing concerns about fiscal policy.

Kathy Jones, managing director and chief income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, voiced a similar opinion this month, noting that ""investors are demanding a higher yield for long-term Treasuries to compensate for the risk of inflation and/or depreciation of the dollar as a consequence of high debt levels.""

These concerns could keep long-term bond yields from falling much, Jones added.

Since the Fed began cutting rates last September, the U.S. labor market has shown signs of significant weakening, bolstering expectations for a quicker pace of Fed rate cuts and a decline in Treasury yields. However, inflation has recently edged higher, complicating that outlook.

When the Fed cut rates in September last year, the year-on-year inflation rate was 2.4%. Last month, it stood at 2.9%, the highest since January's 3% reading. In other words, inflation has regained momentum, weakening the case for faster Fed rate cuts and a drop in Treasury yields.

Yields have already come under pressure, likely reflecting the market's anticipation of Federal Reserve rate cuts.

The 10-year yield slipped to 4% last week, hitting the lowest since April 8, according to data source TradingView. The benchmark yield has dropped over 60 basis points from its May high of 4.62%.

According to Padhraic Garvey, CFA, regional head of research, Americas at ING, the drop to 4% is likely an overshoot to the downside.

""We can see the 10yr Treasury yield targeting still lower as an attack on 4% is successful. But that's likely an overshoot to the downside. Higher inflation prints in the coming months will likely cause long-end yields some issues, requiring a significant adjustment,"" Garvey said in a note to clients last week.

Perhaps rate cuts have been priced in, and yields could bounce back hard following the Sept. 17 move, in a repeat of the 2024 pattern. The dollar index suggests the same, as noted early this week.

The 10-year yield fell by over 100 basis points to 3.60% in roughly five months leading up to the September 2024 rate cut.

The central bank delivered additional rate cuts in November and December. Yet, the 10-year yield bottomed out with the September move and rose to 4.57% by year-end, eventually reaching a high of 4.80% in January of this year.

According to ING, the upswing in yields following the easing was driven by economic resilience, sticky inflation, and fiscal concerns.

As of today, while the economy has weakened, inflation and fiscal concerns have worsened as discussed earlier, which means the 2024 pattern could repeat itself.

While BTC rallied from $70,000 to over $100,000 between October and December 2024 despite rising long-term yields, this surge was primarily fueled by optimism around pro-crypto regulatory policies under President Trump and growing corporate adoption of BTC and other tokens.

However, these supporting narratives have significantly weakened looking back a year later. Consequently, the possibility of a potential hardening of yields in the coming months weighing over bitcoin cannot be dismissed.

BitMEX Co-Founder Arthur Hayes Sees Money Printing Extending Crypto Cycle Well Into 2026

Hayes told Kyle Chassé that governments will keep printing money, fueling crypto well into 2026, while urging bitcoin investors to take a longer view.

Arthur Hayes believes the current crypto bull market has further to run, supported by global monetary trends he sees as only in their early stages.

Speaking in a recent interview with Kyle Chassé, a longtime bitcoin and Web3 entrepreneur, the BitMEX co-founder and current Maelstrom CIO argued that governments around the world are far from finished with aggressive monetary expansion. 

He pointed to U.S. politics in particular, saying that President Donald Trump's second term has not yet fully unleashed the spending programs that could arrive from mid-2026 onward. Hayes suggested that if expectations for money printing become extreme, he may consider taking partial profits, but for now he sees investors underestimating the scale of liquidity that could flow into equities and crypto.

Hayes tied his outlook to broader geopolitical shifts, including what he described as the erosion of a unipolar world order. In his view, such periods of instability tend to push policymakers toward fiscal stimulus and central bank easing as tools to keep citizens and markets calm. 

He also raised the possibility of strains within Europe — even hinting that a French default could destabilize the euro — as another factor likely to accelerate global printing presses. While he acknowledged these policies eventually risk ending badly, he argued that the blow-off top of the cycle is still ahead.

Turning to bitcoin, Hayes pushed back on concerns that the asset has stalled after reaching a record $124,000 in mid-August. 

He contrasted its performance with other asset classes, noting that while U.S. stocks are higher in dollar terms, they have not fully recovered relative to gold since the 2008 financial crisis. Hayes pointed out that real estate also lags when measured against gold, and only a handful of U.S. technology giants have consistently outperformed. 

When measured against bitcoin, however, he believes all traditional benchmarks appear weak. 

Hayes' message was that bitcoin's dominance becomes even clearer once assets are viewed through the lens of currency debasement.

For those frustrated that bitcoin is not posting fresh highs every week, Hayes suggested that expectations are misplaced. 

In his telling, investors from the traditional world and those in crypto actually share the same premise: governments and central banks will print money whenever growth falters. Hayes says traditional finance tends to express this view by buying bonds on leverage, while crypto investors hold bitcoin as the “faster horse.”

His conclusion is that patience is essential. Hayes argued that the real edge of holding bitcoin comes from years of compounding outperformance rather than short-term speculation. 

Coupled with what he sees as an inevitable wave of money creation through the rest of the decade, he believes the present crypto cycle could stretch well into 2026, far from exhausted.

When Core Scientific signed a $3.5 billion deal to host artificial intelligence (AI) data centers earlier this year, it wasn't chasing the next crypto token — it was chasing a steadier paycheck. Once known for its vast fleets of bitcoin mining rigs, the company is now part of a growing trend: converting energy-intensive mining operations into high-performance AI facilities.

Bitcoin miners like Core, Hut 8 (HUT) and TeraWulf (WULF) are swapping ASIC machines — the dedicated bitcoin mining computer — for GPU clusters, driven by the lure of AI's explosive growth and the harsh economics of crypto mining. 

It's no secret that bitcoin mining requires an extensive amount of energy, which is the biggest cost of minting a new digital asset. 

Back in the 2021 bull run, when the Bitcoin network's hashrate and difficulty were low, miners were making out like bandits with margins as much as 90%. Then came the brutal crypto winter and the halving event, which slashed the mining reward in half. In 2025, with surging hashrate and energy prices, miners are now struggling to survive with razor-thin margins. 

However, the need for power—the biggest input cost—became a blessing in disguise for these miners, who needed a different strategy to diversify their revenue sources. 

Due to rising competition for mining, the miners continued to procure more machines to stay afloat, and with it came the need for more megawatts of electricity at a cheaper price. Miners invested heavily in securing these low-cost energy sources, such as hydroelectric or stranded natural gas sites, and developed expertise in managing high-density cooling and electrical systems—skills honed during the crypto boom of the early 2020s. 

This is what captured the attention of AI and cloud computing firms. While bitcoin relies on specialized ASICs, AI thrives on versatile GPUs like Nvidia's H100 series, which require similar high-power environments but for parallel processing tasks in machine learning. Instead of building out data centers from scratch, taking over mining infrastructure, which already has power ready, became a faster way to grow an increasing appetite for AI-related infrastructure. 

Essentially, these miners aren't just pivoting—they're retrofitting. 

The cooling systems, low-cost energy contracts, and power-dense infrastructure they built during the crypto boom now serve a new purpose: feeding the AI models of companies like OpenAI and Google.

Firms like Crusoe Energy sold off mining assets to focus solely on AI, deploying GPU clusters in remote, energy-rich locations that mirror the decentralized ethos of crypto but now fuel centralized AI hyperscalers.

Bitcoin mining has effectively ""terraformed"" the terrain for AI compute by building out scalable, power-efficient infrastructure that AI desperately needs. 

As Nicholas Gregory, Board Director at Fragrant Prosperity, noted, ""It can be argued bitcoin paved the way for digital dollar payments as can be seen with USDT/Tether. It also looks like bitcoin terraformed data centres for AI/GPU compute.""

This pre-existing ""terraforming"" allows miners to retrofit facilities quickly, often in under a year, compared to the multi-year timelines for traditional data center builds. Firms like Crusoe Energy sold off mining assets to focus solely on AI, deploying GPU clusters in remote, energy-rich locations that mirror the decentralized ethos of crypto but now fuel centralized AI hyperscalers.

In practice, it means miners can flip a facility in less than a year—far faster than the multi-year timeline of a new data center. 

But AI isn't a cheap upgrade. 

Bitcoin mining setups are relatively modest, with costs ranging from $300,000 to $800,000 per megawatt (MW) excluding ASICs, allowing for quick scalability in response to market cycles. Meanwhile, AI infrastructure demands significantly higher capex due to the need for advanced liquid cooling, redundant power systems, and the GPUs themselves, which can cost tens of thousands per unit and face global supply shortages. Despite the steeper upfront costs, AI offers miners up to 25 times more revenue per kilowatt-hour than bitcoin mining, making the pivot economically compelling amid rising energy prices and declining crypto profitability.

As AI continues to surge and crypto profits tighten, bitcoin mining could become a niche game—one reserved for energy-rich regions or highly efficient players, especially as the next in 2028 could render many operations unprofitable without breakthroughs in efficiency or energy costs.

While projections show the global crypto mining market growing to $3.3 billion by 2030, at a modest 6.9% CAGR, the billions would be overshadowed by AI's exponential expansion. According to KBV Research, the global AI in mining market is projected to reach $435.94 billion by 2032, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40.6%. 

With investors already seeing dollar signs in this shift, the broader trend suggests the future is either a hybrid or a full conversion to AI, where stable contracts with hyperscalers promise longevity over crypto's boom-bust cycles. 

This evolution not only repurposes idle assets but also underscores how yesterday's crypto frontiers are forging tomorrow's AI empires.

 Bitcoin lacks momentum into the weekly close as a trader says now is the ""time to pay attention"" to BTC price behavior ahead of the Fed rate-cut decision. 

Key points:

Bitcoin drifts toward $115,000 into the weekly close ahead of a key macro week.

BTC needs a weekly close above $114,000 to stay “bullish,” analysis says.

Markets are convinced that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next week.

Bitcoin (BTC) circled weekend lows into Sunday's weekly close ahead of a major week for crypto and risk assets.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD dropping toward $115,000.

The pair avoided major volatility after the week's last Wall Street trading session, during which it hit $116,800 — its highest since Aug. 23.

“Pretty clear price is being walked down here yet again going into a new week,” popular trader Skew summarized about the latest BTC price action in part of a post on X.

Skew flagged “some pretty decent bid depth & liquidity just below $115K” on exchange order books.

“Time to pay attention,” he concluded.

Continuing, market participants remained cool on the short-term outlook, with popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital taking a step-by-step approach.

“The goal isn't for Bitcoin to break $117k in the short-term,” he explained in his latest X post.

Rekt Capital was among those ultimately seeing new all-time highs during the current bull market, arguing that Bitcoin could not have topped out at $124,500.

A weekly close above $114,000 would be “bullish,” he added on the day.

The coming week's main focus was the US Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates.

As Cointelegraph reported, markets unanimously saw policymakers cutting rates by at least 0.25%. Broadly supportive US macro data prints cemented that conviction.

In its latest market update on Sept. 11, trading firm Mosaic Asset Company was optimistic about the outlook for risk assets in Q4 and beyond.

“The combination of improving leading indicators, ongoing loose financial conditions, and strong market breadth that includes participation by cyclical industries favors an ongoing economic expansion in my opinion,” its author wrote.

 Pakistan has invited international crypto firms to apply for licenses under its regulatory authority PVARA, with strict criteria and global compliance standards. 

Pakistan has opened the door to international crypto businesses, inviting leading exchanges and virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to apply for licenses under a new federal regime.

On Saturday, the Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (PVARA) called on major crypto firms to submit Expressions of Interest (EoIs) to enter the country's digital asset market, according to a report by local news outlet Dawn.

“This EoI is our invitation to the world's leading VASPs to partner in building a transparent and inclusive digital financial future for Pakistan,” said Bilal bin Saqib, PVARA chair and minister of state for crypto and blockchain.

Eligibility is limited to firms already licensed by recognized regulators, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the UK Financial Conduct Authority, the EU's VASP framework, the UAE's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority and the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

Submissions should include company profiles, existing licenses and jurisdictions, services proposed (such as trading, custody and payments), technology and security standards, assets under management, revenues, compliance track record and a Pakistan‑specific business model. 

PVARA said the framework aims to curb illicit finance while unlocking fintech, remittance, and tokenization opportunities, including Shariah‑compliant products via regulatory sandboxes. 

PVARA, set up under the Virtual Assets Ordinance 2025, is tasked with licensing, regulating and supervising VASPs in line with standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.

As Cointelegraph reported, Pakistan surged to third place in Chainalysis' 2025 Global Crypto Adoption Index, climbing six spots and emerging as one of the world's fastest-growing crypto markets. 

In May, Pakistan announced plans to establish a government-led Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Bilal Bin Saqib said the move reflects Pakistan's new pro-crypto regulatory approach.

The country also earmarked 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for Bitcoin (BTC) mining and AI centers as part of an initiative led by the Pakistan Crypto Council and supported by the Ministry of Finance.

However, in July, the IMF expressed concerns regarding Pakistan's plan to use surplus electricity for crypto mining, rejecting a proposal to offer subsidized power to energy-intensive industries, including Bitcoin miners.

 Capital Group has turned a $1 billion bet on Bitcoin treasury stocks into $6 billion, with major holdings in Strategy and Metaplanet. 

Capital Group, a 94-year-old mutual fund powerhouse known for its conservative investment approach, has grown a $1 billion position in Bitcoin-related stocks into more than $6 billion.

Mark Casey, a portfolio manager with 25 years at Capital Group, led the firm's move into Bitcoin. Casey, who describes his investment style as shaped by Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett, has become an advocate for Bitcoin (BTC), according to a Sunday report by The Wall Street Journal. 

“I just love Bitcoin, I just think it is so interesting,” Casey said during a podcast interview with venture firm Andreessen Horowitz. He called Bitcoin “one of the coolest things that has ever been created by people,” per the WSJ report.

Over the past four years, Capital Group has built its exposure primarily through investments in so-called Bitcoin treasury companies, public firms that accumulate and hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets.

Capital Group's most notable holding is in Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), the software firm transformed into a Bitcoin vehicle by founder Michael Saylor.

In 2021, Capital Group acquired a 12.3% stake in Strategy for over $500 million. That stake, now diluted to 7.89% due to share issuance and some trimming, is worth about $6.2 billion following a more than 2,200% surge in Strategy's stock over five years.

Casey said he and his colleagues analyze these companies the same way they assess firms involved in commodities like gold or oil. “We view Bitcoin as a commodity,” he told the WSJ.

Capital Group's Bitcoin exposure also includes a 5% stake in Japan-based Metaplanet, a hotel operator-turned-Bitcoin holder, and shares of mining company Mara Holdings.

As Cointelegraph reported, corporate Bitcoin treasuries now hold over 1 million BTC worth more than $117 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. 

Michael Saylor's Strategy remains the top holder with 636,505 BTC, followed by MARA Holdings with over 52,000 BTC. Newcomers like XXI and Bitcoin Standard Treasury are quickly gaining ground, while firms like Metaplanet, Bullish and Coinbase round out the top 10.

Looking ahead, companies like Metaplanet and Semler Scientific have revealed aggressive accumulation targets, aiming to acquire 210,000 BTC and 105,000 BTC by 2027, respectively.

The discovery could solve a tragic mystery from the Qin Dynasty.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

This story is a collaboration with Biography.com.

Fifty years ago, a routine well-digging operation on the outskirts of Xi'an, China, led to the unexpected discovery of a single clay soldier. When government authorities continued to excavate the well, they found the soldier was just one in a massive terracotta army standing guard over a vast necropolis. It turns out they had discovered the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor, a funerary site over 2,000 years old.

Half a century later, the legendary mausoleum continues to reveal its secrets, with the latest excavation uncovering a mysterious treasure that may confirm an ancient Chinese legend: A 16-ton casket filled with treasures—including armor, weapons, 6,000 bronze coins, jade, and gold and silver camels—was just unearthed from a tomb within the vast funerary complex, according to The Daily Express.

This type of untouched tomb is rare; neither the coffin, nor its treasures, appear to have been plundered by grave robbers across the past two millennia. “Most ancient tombs have been robbed so we didn't have much hope for the coffin chamber,” excavation leader Jiang Wenxiao told the Express. “But it turned out it hadn't been robbed. We were amazed.” 

The tomb, however, was “considerably decayed,” Wenxiao said, and the fear of further degradation finally led archaeologists to excavate and examine it more than a decade after its initial discovery in 2011.  

Now, the archaeologists want to determine just who is buried inside. “The grand manner of his burial suggests he was a notable warrior,” the experts observed, per the Express. That may be an understatement. 

The recently excavated tomb is just one of many within the necropolis, built to honor Qin Shi Huang (秦始皇), the First Emperor of Qin. As noted by National Geographic, Qin himself called for the construction of this mausoleum shortly after he had ascended to the throne in 246 B.C., at only 13 years old.

Qin's titanic actions as emperor would ultimately merit the lavish burial place he had ordered. In addition to unifying the warring states that formed China, Qin “standardized coins, weights, and measures; interlinked the states with canals and roads; and is credited for building the first version of the Great Wall,” NatGeo notes.

Much of what we know about Qin, the construction of his tomb, and the secrets of the yet-to-be-excavated areas stems from a 2,000-year-old document called the Shiji (史記), also known as the Records of the Grand Historian. 



The Shiji, a sprawling and hugely significant work by Prefect of the Grand Scribes Sima Qian (司馬遷) that contained everything from genaological tables and biographies to the history of rituals and waterways, is a “foundational text in Chinese civilization,” according to Grant Hardy, author of Worlds of Bronze and Bamboo: Sima Qian's Conquest of History.

“Sima wrote a universal history,” Hardy writes, “...and in doing so, he defined what it meant to be Chinese.”

The Shiji recounts the tale of Qin Shi Huang's son, Prince Gao, who suffered a tragic fate. After Qin Shi Huang's death, his eldest son, Fusu, was expected to take the throne. But due to acts of deception by certain members of the dynasty, Huhai, Qin's 18th son, ascended to power instead. 

As the story goes, another of the Qin descendants, Prince Gao, saw his brothers and sisters all either being killed or dying by suicide, and considered fleeing the country. “But Prince Gao realised that his family would be hounded as a result,” the Express summarizes, “...and confronted Hu Hai, telling him that he had let their father down by not joining him in death.”

According to the Shiji, Prince Gao requested that upon his own death at their hands, he should be laid to rest in the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor. And with this recent excavation, archaeologists are wondering if the tomb they've stumbled upon ultimately contains the remains of Prince Gao.

“For the first time in 2,000 years,” said Hui Ming Tak Ted, a historian of the Qin dynasty and associate professor at Oxford University, “...we have a chance to figure out if what Sima Qian wrote is correct.”

It'll help unlock the inner workings of superconductors.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

 Condensed matter physicists from the University of Illinois have successfully summoned a demon, but probably not the one you're picturing—think less fire and brimstone and more quantum mechanics trickery. The “demon,” in this case, actually stands for “distinct electron motion” with the physics favorite suffix “-on” added for good measure. 

Theorized by physicist David Pines in 1956, this demon (also known as Pine's Demon) is a plasmon—a discrete wave rippling through plasma electrons—that is massless and has a neutral charge. As you'd probably imagine, something that's both massless and neutral isn't exactly easy to detect. 

But a paper published by scientists at the University of Illinois showcases how they stumbled upon this demon plasmon by accident. At first, the team was only analyzing the metal strontium ruthenate to figure out why it contained similar properties to high-temperature superconductors (around -130 degrees Celsius) without actually being one. Then, they spotted a quasiparticle that was too slow to be a surface plasmon but too fast to be an acoustic phonon.

“At first, we had no idea what it was. Demons are not in the mainstream. The possibility came up early on, and we basically laughed it off,” co-author Ali Husain said in a press statement. “But, as we started ruling things out, we started to suspect that we had really found the demon.”

To find the demon, the team fired electrons off a crystal of the metal strontium ruthenate and measured energy gain with an incredibly high precision. Using this energy data, scientists could then track the demon's momentum within the material until finally discovering that the quasiparticle closely matched Pine's 67-year-old predictions of a massless electronic mode, or demon. The results were published in the journal Nature. 

“It speaks to the importance of just measuring stuff,” Peter Abbamonte, physics professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champlain and co-author, said in a press statement. “Most big discoveries are not planned. You go look somewhere new and see what's there.”

The discovery of a demon is particularly important for understanding superconductors. Because this quasiparticle is massless, it can form with any energy and potentially at any temperature. 

The standard theory of superconductors, known as the BCS theory, attributes superconductivity to an interaction between electrons and phonons, the natural vibrations given off by an atomic crystal lattice. However, the BCS Theory can't always explain the zero energy resistance of high-temperature superconductors, which suggests some materials achieve superconductivity through other means. One of these means could be this newly discovered demon quasiparticle, as they've been theorized to play a role in a semimetal's transition into superconductivity. 

The first step in any breakthrough is to first face your demons—hopefully, the same can be said for superconductors as well.

Highlights:

People with chronic insomnia may experience faster declines in memory and thinking skills as they age -- along with brain changes that can be seen on imaging scans -- than people who do not have chronic insomnia, according to a study published in the September 10, 2025, issue of Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.

The study found that people with chronic insomnia -- trouble sleeping at least three days a week for three months or more -- had a 40% higher risk of developing mild cognitive impairment or dementia than those without insomnia, which is the equivalent of 3.5 additional years of aging. The study does not prove that insomnia causes brain aging, it only shows an association.

""Insomnia doesn't just affect how you feel the next day -- it may also impact your brain health over time,"" said study author Diego Z. Carvalho, MD, of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and a member of the American Academy of Neurology. ""We saw faster decline in thinking skills and changes in the brain that suggest chronic insomnia could be an early warning sign or even a contributor to future cognitive problems.""

The study tracked a group of cognitively healthy older adults -- 2,750 people with an average age of 70 -- for an average of 5.6 years. Of participants, 16% had chronic insomnia.

At the start of the study, participants were asked whether they had been sleeping more or less than usual during the past two weeks. They also took yearly thinking and memory tests, and some had brain scans to look for white matter hyperintensities -- areas where small vessel disease may have damaged brain tissue -- and for amyloid plaques, a protein that can build up and is linked to Alzheimer's disease.

During the study, 14% of the people with chronic insomnia developed mild cognitive impairment or dementia, compared to 10% of those who did not have insomnia.

After accounting for factors like age, high blood pressure, use of sleep medications and a diagnosis of sleep apnea, they found that people with insomnia were 40% more likely to develop mild cognitive impairment or dementia than those without insomnia. They also had faster declines on tests measuring different thinking skills.

Among those with insomnia, researchers determined the type: those getting less sleep than usual in the past two weeks; or those getting more sleep than usual in the past two weeks.

People who reported getting less sleep than usual were more likely to have lower cognitive test scores at the beginning of the study, comparable to being four years older. They also had more white matter hyperintensities and amyloid plaques. For amyloid, the effect was similar to what is seen in people with the APOE ε4 gene, a known genetic risk factor.

People who reported getting more sleep than usual, on the other hand, were more likely to have fewer white matter hyperintensities at the start of the study.

Some groups were especially vulnerable. Participants who carry the APOE ε4 gene -- linked to higher Alzheimer's risk -- showed steeper declines in memory and thinking skills.

""Our results suggest that insomnia may affect the brain in different ways, involving not only amyloid plaques, but also small vessels supplying blood to the brain,"" Carvalho said. ""This reinforces the importance of treating chronic insomnia -- not just to improve sleep quality but potentially to protect brain health as we age. Our results also add to a growing body of evidence that sleep isn't just about rest -- it's also about brain resilience.""

A limitation of the study was that insomnia diagnoses came from medical records, which do not capture undiagnosed cases or reflect how severe symptoms are.

The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health, GHR Foundation, Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, and a grant from Sleep Number Corporation to the Mayo Clinic.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","NASA's Webb Space Telescope just found strange red dots that shouldn't exist","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250913232927.htm","Sun, 14 Sep 2025 09:10:31 GMT","

Tiny red objects spotted by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are offering scientists new insights into the origins of galaxies in the universe -- and may represent an entirely new class of celestial object: a black hole swallowing massive amounts of matter and spitting out light.

Using the first datasets released by the telescope in 2022, an international team of scientists including Penn State researchers discovered mysterious ""little red dots."" The researchers suggested the objects may be galaxies that were as mature as our current Milky Way, which is roughly 13.6 billion years old, just 500 to 700 million years after the Big Bang.

Informally dubbed ""universe breakers"" by the team, the objects were originally thought to be galaxies far older than anyone expected in the infant universe -- calling into question what scientists previously understood about galaxy formation.

Now, in a paper published on Sept. 12 in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics, the international team of astronomers and physicists, including those at Penn State, suggest that the dots may not be galaxies but an entirely new type of object: a black hole star.

They said their analysis indicates that the tiny pinpoints of light may be giant spheres of hot gas that are so dense they look like the atmospheres of typical nuclear fusion-powered stars; however, instead of fusion, they are powered by supermassive black holes in their center that rapidly pull in matter, converting it into energy and giving off light.

""Basically, we looked at enough red dots until we saw one that had so much atmosphere that it couldn't be explained as typical stars we'd expect from a galaxy,"" said Joel Leja, the Dr. Keiko Miwa Ross Mid-Career Associate Professor of Astrophysics at Penn State and co-author on the paper. ""It's an elegant answer really, because we thought it was a tiny galaxy full of many separate cold stars, but it's actually, effectively, one gigantic, very cold star.""

Cold stars emit little light due to their low temperatures compared to normal stars, Leja explained. Most stars in the universe are low-mass, colder stars, but they are typically harder to see as they are washed out by rarer, more luminous massive stars. Astronomers identify cold stars by their glow, which is primarily in the red optical or near-infrared spectrum, wavelengths of light that are no longer visible. While the gas around supermassive black holes is typically very hot, millions of degrees Celsius, the light from these ""red dot"" black holes was instead dominated by very cold gas, the researchers said, similar to the atmospheres of low-mass, cold stars, based on the wavelengths of light they were giving off.

The most powerful telescope in space, JWST was designed to see the genesis of the cosmos with infrared-sensing instruments capable of detecting light that was emitted by the most ancient stars and galaxies. Essentially, the telescope allows scientists to see back in time roughly 13.5 billion years, near the beginning of the universe as we know it, Leja explained.

From the moment the telescope turned on, researchers around the world began to spot ""little red dots,"" objects that appeared far more massive than galaxy models predicted. At first, Leja said, he and his colleagues thought the objects were mature galaxies, which tend to get redder as the stars within them age. But the objects were too bright to be explained -- the stars would need to be packed in the galaxies with impossible density.

""The night sky of such a galaxy would be dazzlingly bright,"" said Bingjie Wang, now a NASA Hubble Fellow at Princeton University who worked on the paper as a postdoctoral researcher at Penn State. ""If this interpretation holds, it implies that stars formed through extraordinary processes that have never been observed before.""

To better understand the mystery, the researchers needed spectra, a type of data that could provide information about how much light the objects emitted at different wavelengths. Between January and December 2024, the astronomers used nearly 60 hours of Webb time to obtain spectra from a total of 4,500 distant galaxies. It is one of the largest spectroscopic datasets yet obtained with the telescope.

In July 2024, the team spotted an object with a spectrum that indicated a huge amount of mass, making it the most extreme case of such an early and large object. The astronomers nicknamed the object in question ""The Cliff,"" flagging it as the most promising test case to investigate just what those ""little red dots"" were.

""The extreme properties of The Cliff forced us to go back to the drawing board, and come up with entirely new models,"" said Anna de Graaff, a researcher for the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy and corresponding author on the paper, in a Max Planck Institute press release.

The object was so distant that its light took roughly 11.9 billion years to reach Earth. The spectra analysis of that light indicated it was actually a supermassive black hole, pulling in its surroundings at such a rate that it cocooned itself in a fiery ball of hydrogen gas. The light that Leja and his colleagues spotted was coming not from thick clusters of stars, but from one giant object.

Black holes are at the center of most galaxies, Leja explained. In some cases, those black holes are millions or even billions of times more massive than our solar system's sun, pulling in nearby matter with such strength that it converts to energy and shines.

""No one's ever really known why or where these gigantic black holes at the center of galaxies come from,"" said Leja, who is also affiliated with Penn State's Institute for Computational and Data Sciences. ""These black hole stars might be the first phase of formation for the black holes that we see in galaxies today -- supermassive black holes in their little infancy stage.""

He added that JWST has already found signs of high-mass black holes in the early universe. These new black hole star objects, which are essentially turbocharged mass-builders, could help explain the early evolution of the universe -- and may be a welcome addition to current models. The team is planning future work to test this hypothesis by examining the density of gas and strength of these early black hole stars, Leja said.

Of course, the mysterious ""little red dots"" are great distance away in both time and space -- and their small size makes it especially challenging to get a clear picture.

""This is the best idea we have and really the first one that fits nearly all of the data, so now we need to flesh it out more,"" Leja said. ""It's okay to be wrong. The universe is much weirder than we can imagine and all we can do is follow its clues. There are still big surprises out there for us.""

A full list of authors is available in the paper. The Penn State aspects of this work were funded by NASA.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","The sweetpotato's DNA turned out stranger than anyone expected","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250913232938.htm","Sun, 14 Sep 2025 14:32:09 GMT","

The sweetpotato feeds millions worldwide, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where its natural resilience to climate extremes makes it crucial for food security. But this humble root vegetable has guarded its genetic secrets for decades. Now, scientists have finally decoded its complex genome, revealing an intricate origin story and providing powerful tools to help improve this vital crop.

Sweetpotato DNA is extraordinarily complex. While humans have two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent, sweetpotatoes have six. This condition, called hexaploidy, made deciphering their genetic code like trying to reconstruct six different, yet similar, sets of encyclopedias that have been shuffled together.

A team led by Professor Zhangjun Fei at the Boyce Thompson Institute achieved a significant breakthrough, as reported in Nature Plants. Using cutting-edge DNA sequencing, along with other advanced techniques, they created the first complete genetic makeup of 'Tanzania' -- a sweetpotato variety prized in Africa for its disease resistance and high dry matter content.

The central challenge was to untangle the plant's 90 chromosomes and organize them into their six original sets, called haplotypes. The team succeeded in fully separating, or 'phasing,' this complex genetic puzzle, something that had never been achieved before.

""Having this complete, phased genome gives us an unprecedented level of clarity,"" explains Fei. ""It allows us to read the sweetpotato's genetic story with incredible detail.""

The research revealed surprising complexity. The sweetpotato genome is a mosaic assembled from multiple wild ancestors, some of which have yet to be identified. About one-third comes from Ipomoea aequatoriensis, a wild species found in Ecuador that appears to be a direct descendant of a sweetpotato progenitor. Another significant portion resembles a wild Central American species called Ipomoea batatas 4x, though the actual donor may still remain undiscovered in the wild.

""Unlike what we see in wheat, where ancestral contributions can be found in distinct genome sections,"" says Shan Wu, the study's first author, ""in sweetpotato, the ancestral sequences are intertwined on the same chromosomes, creating a unique genomic architecture.""

This intertwined genetic heritage means that sweetpotato can be tentatively classified as a ""segmental allopolyploid"" -- essentially a hybrid that arose from different species but behaves genetically as if it came from a single one. This genomic merging and recombination gives sweetpotato its remarkable adaptability and disease resistance, traits crucial for subsistence farmers worldwide.

""The sweetpotato's six sets of chromosomes also contribute to its enhanced resilience,"" adds Fei. ""With multiple versions of important genes, the plant can maintain backup copies that help it survive drought, resist pests, and adapt to different environments -- a feature known as polyploid buffering.""

However, achieving a full understanding of sweetpotato's genetic potential will require decoding multiple varieties from different regions, as each may carry unique genetic features that have been lost in others.

The work by Fei and his team represents more than just an academic milestone. Equipped with a clearer understanding of sweetpotato's complex genetics, breeders can now more efficiently identify genes responsible for key traits like yield, nutritional content, and resistance to drought and disease. This precision could accelerate the development of improved varieties.

Beyond sweetpotato, this research demonstrates how modern genomic tools can help decode other complex genomes. Many important crops, including wheat, cotton, and banana, have multiple sets of chromosomes.

As climates shift and pest and disease pressures increase, understanding these genetic puzzles is critical for breeding resilient crops and addressing challenges in food security.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Physicists just found a way to make “something from nothing”","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250913232932.htm","Sun, 14 Sep 2025 13:47:50 GMT","

In 1951, physicist Julian Schwinger theorized that by applying a uniform electrical field to a vacuum, electron-positron pairs would be spontaneously created out of nothing, through a phenomenon called quantum tunneling.

The problem with turning the matter-out-of-nowhere theory into Star Trek replicators or transporters? Enormously high electric fields would be required -- far beyond the limits of any direct physical experiments.

As a result, the aptly named Schwinger effect has never been seen.

Now theoretical physicists at the University of British Columbia (UBC) have described a parallel effect in a more manageable system. In their model, they substitute a thin film of superfluid helium for the vacuum, and the background flow of the superfluid for the massive electrical field.

""Superfluid Helium-4 is a wonder. At a few atomic layers thick it can be cooled very easily to a temperature where it's basically in a frictionless vacuum state,"" explains Dr. Philip Stamp, a theorist at UBC working on condensed matter and quantum gravity, and author of the new findings published on Sept. 2 in PNAS.

""When we make that frictionless vacuum flow, instead of electron-positron pairs appearing, vortex/anti-vortex pairs will appear spontaneously, spinning in opposite directions to one another.""

In the paper, Dr. Stamp and UBC colleague Michael Desrochers outline the theory and the mathematics behind it -- mapping out a detailed approach to conducting a direct experiment.

Vacuum tunneling is a process of keen interest in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. In quantum theory, vacuums aren't empty, they're filled with fluctuating fields that can lead to the temporary appearance and disappearance of virtual particles.

""We believe the Helium-4 film provides a nice analog to several cosmic phenomena,"" adds Dr. Stamp. ""The vacuum in deep space, quantum black holes, even the very beginning of the Universe itself. And these are phenomena we can't ever approach in any direct experimental way.""

However, Dr. Stamp emphasizes that the real interest of the work may lie less in an analogs - which always have limitations - and more in the way it alters our understanding of superfluids, and of phase transitions in two-dimensional systems.

""These are real physical systems in their own right, not analogs. And we can do experiments on these.""

At the mathematical level, the researchers needed several breakthroughs to make the theory work. For example, previous researchers looking at vortices in superfluids have treated the vortex mass as an unchanging constant. Dr. Stamp and Desrochers showed that this mass will vary dramatically as the vortices move, fundamentally changing our understanding of vortices in both fluids and the early universe.

""It's exciting to understand how and why the mass varies, and how this affects our understanding of quantum tunneling processes, which are ubiquitous in physics, chemistry and biology,"" says Desrochers.

Stamp also argues that the same mass variability will occur with electron-positron pairs in the Schwinger effect, thence modifying Schwinger's theory, in a kind of 'revenge of the analog'.

The work was supported by the National Science and Engineering Research Council.

Indoor plant care is always tricky. While it's all fine and dandy to take care of them when the summer sun is shining, keeping your plants alive in winter can feel like a whole 'nother story. Being a houseplant enthusiast is akin to having several silent children, all with finicky needs and limited ways of communicating them. If your green thumb is feeling a little yellow or brown these days, fear not! I interviewed several experts to figure out exactly how to keep your plants happy during the colder months. Here's what they had to say.

The fact of the matter is, most plants don't look “happy” during winter. Because it's winter. Unless you have a fancy automated hydroponic garden at your disposal, your greatest tools will be patience and attentiveness. Most plants have new growth during the longer days of spring and summer and enter a period of slowness or dormancy during shorter days of autumn and winter.

Brian Wheat, professor of horticulture at Trident Technical College, says, “Stop trying so hard and worrying so much” and reminds us that time and patience are crucial (and that maybe we shouldn't anthropomorphize plants). “Perhaps we forget the fact that what may look like a struggling plant today could be thriving in, let's say, three to four weeks, if we give it a chance.” He adds, “Nine times out of 10, your plants are OK and don't really need much from you. In fact, you might be doing them more bad than good by being a hummingbird plant parent (I just made that up, it's kind of like helicopter parenting, but for plants).”

Tatiana Anderson, cofounder of Top Tropicals, says not to panic if growth slows or a few leaves drop. “What you want to see is steady color, firm leaves, and no major changes,"" she says. ""A ‘happy' winter plant often looks calm, not busy.”

Watering is the bane of my existence, as evinced by the monstera that I accidentally drown every other month.

“One of the biggest issues with house plants is overwatering, which can lead to problems like root rot,"" says Wheat. ""This is especially challenging during the winter months,” And it can be even trickier if your plants are outside during the warmer months. Moving them indoors means moving them to an environment that's drier and cooler.

“Relative humidity is usually between 30 and 50 percent inside, whereas plants generally prefer a higher humidity,” Wheat says. He points out that the soil or media will dry out faster, especially in heated homes. But that doesn't mean you need to water plants more in winter. Because they aren't growing as actively, they're doing less “plant stuff” such as transpiration and photosynthesis. That means they're using less water.

Justin Hancock, Costa Farms horticulturist, says to be wary if you usually water your plants on a schedule. “If you're used to giving them a fixed amount of water every week, you could inadvertently overwater in winter if they don't drink that much. If you're in doubt, it's almost always better to let houseplants get a little too dry than to keep them consistently too wet.”

And, according to Andrew Connolly, founder of Little Flower Cottage, you should “try to always use room temperature water, as really cold water can shock the plant.” He adds that “overwatering is the fastest way to lose a plant in the winter.”

Anup Mutalik, chief editor at Houseplants Nook, says, “We always do the finger test and water only when the top 2 inches are dry. Overwatering is a bigger risk in winter, because evaporation slows down. For most plants, we cut back to watering once every 15 days!”

Wheat advises to make sure your plants aren't bone-dry or soaking wet. “Get to know the weight of your pot when it is dry and watered,” he says. “Feel it out."" Anderson adds that if the soil on top is dry and the pot feels light, it's time for water. Per Wheat: “If your plant is wilting and the soil is dry, it needs water. If your plant is wilting and the soil is wet, it's overwatered.” He also reminds us to be patient. “A simple change you make can take days or weeks to show an impact.”

Move your plants close to windows so they can get enough light. “Most plants prefer direct to indirect sunlight. An east-, or southeast- to southwest-facing window can provide this. North-facing windows do not. If you don't have any windows providing sunlight, artificial light will no doubt be a requirement,” says Wheat.

Hancock adds, “Put a thermometer at the windowsill and check it periodically (particularly at night) first. Make sure the windowsill doesn't drop below about 55 [degrees Fahrenheit] or so; cooler temperatures than that can stress some species.” Connelly recommends rotating plants every week or so, too. “Basically all sides need to get roughly the same amount of light.”

Every expert I spoke with recommended snagging a few inexpensive full-spectrum grow lights to supplement your plants during the winter. (I'm working on a buying guide on the Best Grow Lights, so look for WIRED-tested recommendations soon! WIRED editor Kat Merck likes the full-spectrum bulbs above, which she puts in can lights for extra-tall plants in dark corners.) Mutalik says, “You can just buy a couple grow lamps and keep rotating plants in and out of them so you don't invest too much at once.”

Experts also recommend ensuring that your plants' leaves are free of dust, which blocks the light. Hancock points out that dust can accumulate faster in the winter due to drier air and the use of furnaces or other heat sources like fireplaces.

“Any dust film that builds up reduces the amount of light that actually reaches the leaf. So a really dusty plant in a sunny window might only be able to access half the light coming through if a dust layer is blocking the other half,” he says. You can gently wipe them with a soft, damp cloth or use a specialty tool designed for the purpose, like Goha's microfiber Leaf Sweep, above.

Hancock says that, similarly to how humans can experience dry skin and chapped lips in the winter, plants can feel the effects of low humidity and dry air, too—especially plants with thinner leaves. “As a general rule, the thicker the leaf texture, the more resilient a plant is to low humidity,” he says. He recommends boosting humidity by “investing in a small humidifier or grouping plants together, [since] they release moisture in the air as they breathe.”

He also says that most plants are comfortable with the same humidity you are—about 40 to 60 percent. And you can skip the misting. “Misting adds humidity for only a couple of minutes. It's not enough to actually help the plant, unfortunately,” says Hancock.

“If leaf edges turn brown or curl, that's usually a humidity cry for help,” per Mutalik. “We keep humidity-loving plants like calatheas, ferns, and marantas grouped together on pebble trays and run a humidifier nearby.” (Our WIRED-tested favorite is above.) He says that a windowed bathroom is also great for tropical plants that love high humidity. “It doesn't have to be fancy,” adds Anderson.

We already covered that you should monitor the warmth near your windows to ensure it doesn't drop below 55 degrees Fahrenheit. But ambient air temperatures can affect your houseplants as well. “If you're feeling chilly, your plants probably are, too,” says Hancock. “And they can't put on a sweater.”

You'll also want to watch out for drafts. “If you have a houseplant near a heating vent where it's getting exposed to air that's noticeably warmer or cooler than the ambient air temperature, it can stress your plant, causing leaves to yellow prematurely,” says Hancock.

Drafts can be caused by exterior doors and windows. Connolly points out that heating vents and space heaters can be detrimental, too. Plants “like the temperature to stay consistent and not be swinging back and forth between hot and cold.”

Awareness is key when it comes to heat and airflow. “We keep anything leafy or tropical at least 2 feet away from heaters and ensure windows are well-insulated,” says Mutalik.

If you're bringing your plants indoors from outside, experts recommend quarantining them for a period of time to ensure they aren't hosting any pests that could affect your other houseplants. (Because let's be real—nobody has just one houseplant.) “Catching them early saves a lot of heartache,” says Anderson.

Mutalik and the rest of the Houseplant Nook quarantine their plants for two weeks. Check under every leaf for mites, mealybugs, or gnats. If you encounter pests, there are a few ways of addressing them that can vary based on preference and plant species. Wheat removes them manually if possible, and wipes them down with a cloth or a light vinegar solution before moving on to other, more aggressive measures like horticultural oils or soaps if needed. (Editor Kat Merck uses the insecticidal soap above on her houseplants and hydroponic gardens.)

Connolly wipes plants down with a cloth and then rinses them in the sink. And Mutalik says that Neem oil or castile soap can work wonders if you catch the pests early; wipe the leaves, especially broader leaves, every two weeks to prevent infection.

While many winter pests hitch a ride indoors, Hancock points out that dry, warm conditions (like those found in heated homes in winter) are the ideal environment for spider mites.

“Regularly washing plant leaves can help dislodge spider mites and help keep the population low. If you're just seeing spider mites and don't want to spray, consider investing in beneficial mites. Beneficial mites will eat the spider mites and don't harm your plant,” he says.

Fertilizer is always a little confusing, and it can be even more puzzling in the wintertime. “I would say, don't even bother to fertilize your house plant if you're using an over-the-counter potting soil. Most of these soils have slow-release fertilizer in them that is sufficient for plant growth,” says Wheat.

If you have an older plant with tired soil, or a particularly “heavy feeder,” you can opt for a slow or controlled-release fertilizer—or just repot it with fresh soil. (But be aware that winter isn't usually the best time to repot a plant, and you may want to wait until the growing season arrives.)

“Keep it gentle,” advises Anderson. “If you do feed, make it a weak solution once a month, just enough to keep the leaves green.”

Mutalik says there are just a few exceptions. “We pause all fertilizing during the winter dormancy period, unless a plant is actively growing (like some pothos or philodendrons that surprise us).” He says that feeding a dormant plant stresses it out, similarly to overwatering, and can cause leaf burn or browning edges. “If you really want to fertilize, and the leaves are actively being pushed out, dilute the fertilizer to one-fourth and add it to the base right after watering and flushing the soil.” (Editor Kat Merck uses and recommends the fertilizer above.)

Over winter, what you want is a stable, calm plant. “If any of the leaves are turning yellow or the soil smells nasty, those are bad signs,” says Connolly. And if you do notice something going awry, it's best to make small adjustments rather than throwing the book of problem-solving at your houseplants. Gradual changes are the best way to help a plant bounce back, rather than risking stressing it further. There are even apps that claim to help you figure out what's wrong with your plants. (I'm testing a few out and will recommend one in an upcoming guide.)

I'll let Wheat take it from here. “Don't worry. Take it easy. Stop trying so hard. Winter gives way to spring and your plants go through cycles where they make look ‘happy' or 'sad' but it's all part of any plant's natural lifecycle. Be patient—but attentive—and you'll see your plants thrive.”

WIRED Editor Amit Katwala has traveled far and wide for a hands-on look at the future of robotic artificial limbs, and the technological progress he witnessed is beyond impressive. But in truth, his quest to become Superhuman is still stuck in the prototype phase. I, on the other hand, have been galavanting around the English countryside wearing the Hypershell Pro X, the first readily available leg-boosting, mile-eating, powered exoskeleton.

As a broader product category, exoskeletons have the potential to enhance mobility for those with disabilities, helping them regain independence and improve their quality of life. They can also reduce physical strain in the workplace, minimizing the chances of injury and boosting productivity. But the likes of Hypershell produces nonmedical, wearable exoskeletons that promise muscle-boosting power for us average Joes.

The majority of these designs, however, seem to be permanently on preorder, or ambitiously chasing the big bucks on Kickstarter, so it's refreshing to be able to test something that's available on Amazon.

Last year I reviewed a prelaunch version of the similar DNSYS X1 (WIRED 5/10) and found it to be glitchy, heavy, and generally disappointing, but it did show promise. It remains stuck in preorder however, as does the much-publicized pair of $5,000 Arc'teryx MO/GO powered pants.

So can Hypershell do it better? There are currently three versions of the Hypershell exoskeleton: the basic 400-watt, $900 Hypershell Go X, the $1,199 Pro X which has a 800-watt output, 10.8-mile range, and enhanced capabilities for running and even cycling assistance. And then there's the Hypershell Carbon X, which uses a titanium alloy instead of carbon fiber and costs $1,500.

The Go X offers 7.5 miles per hour maximum speed assistance while the Pro X's 800-watt motor can help up to speeds of 12.4 miles per hour. Each model collapses down to 16.9 × 10.2 × 4.9 inches, and the Go and Pro X weigh 4.41 pounds, while the Carbon version is 7 ounces lighter.

My Hypershell Pro X sample has a 5000-mAh 72-Wh battery, with quoted assisted range of 10.8 miles (17.5 kilometers) and 10 modes, including up and down stairs, down and uphill, cycling, running, race walking, and regular walking. I've been wearing the exoskeleton for the past few months while testing various outdoor gear, including hiking boots and rain jackets, and within seconds of turning it on I knew it was significantly more useful than the DNSYS X1, giving my legs a nice power-up on trails. Did I feel like a fool wearing it in public? Absolutely. Did my wife ask me “Why are you walking like Woody from Toy Story?” Yes. But for many people in need, the benefit of the assistance should outweigh the mild embarrassment.

Strapping myself in for the first time, I'm impressed by the build quality, the ergonomic fit, and adjustability. The lower back and hip cushioning is particularly good. I'm 5′ 11′′ tall, and most adults—Hypershell estimates 80 percent—will have no fitting issues. The excellent app takes you through the whole process, with step-by-step video instructions on adjusting to fit, and then once you're corseted in, it demos the various power modes and controls. When you first power on, the inert machine springs to life and tightens up, and once you've chosen a power mode, it instantly starts to work as you walk.

Using its multiple sensors, the Hypershell detects your leg movement and then makes the most of the motor to help lift your legs as you stride, with up to 32 newton-meters of torque. In Eco mode the effect is noticeable but not aggressive, but in the higher-torque settings, your leg will be propelled upwards. It feels odd and unnatural, like you're a bionic marionette.

Hypershell claims its device offsets 30 kilograms, or 66 pounds of weight. Remember though, it is also having to compensate for its own weight, and while 4.4 pounds isn't prohibitively heavy, it's not something you want to add to your pack if the battery dies mid-hike. In all the time testing, and walking, I didn't once forget I was wearing the Hypershell. The leg straps do get sweaty, and I certainly could feel the unit's weight. It also makes you walk a little oddly—I guess, robotically. This feels pretty great when locked into a nice pace, but it's not casual.

The Hypershell definitely helps your legs move. It positively jerks them up as you stride, but what impact does it have on physical effort? To test this, I went for two hilly but not mountainous walks with a heart rate tracker on. First I checked my heart rate (83 bpm) and then hiked without the exoskeleton, and then, once my heart rate had returned to its previous level, hiked up again with the Pro X on the Eco mode, which is the standard level recommended.

Comparing readings from my Garmin Epix Pro, my unassisted walk—1.8 miles in 28.57 minutes—registered an average speed of 6 km/h and an average heart rate of 102 bpm, with a max heart rate of 127 bpm. In contrast, when I repeated the route wearing the exoskeleton it took 28.19 minutes, with an average speed of 6.1 km/h and an average heart rate of 104 bpm, and maximum of 145 bpm. I was expecting the assisted walk to use less energy and therefore not peak my heart rate.

The thing is, I could feel the exoskeleton pulling my legs and propelling me forward. The impact felt considerable, and made the steepest sections feel easier, with less tiredness at the top. Maybe I was walking faster, pushing myself harder with the robot help? Maybe I was nervous, or excited by the new tech, which pushed up my heart rate. Hmmm …

But in truth this wasn't the first time I'd experienced these results. I did a similar test some weeks earlier, up a short, very steep hill with the Hypershell on full power. I was so surprised by the results—which, again, suggested it was taking me more effort with the exoskeleton than without—that I contacted the brand and they sent me a second unit to try, assuming this was a fault.

I've seen reviews online that also compare heart rate data, and they've had more positive results, but I can only go on my own data and repeated experience. The Hypershell feels like it's helping me, and I like the leg boost, but is it really?

Compared to the DNSYS X1, the Hypershell Pro X is an altogether more polished experience, with none of the glitchy issues I experienced before. It's also the only design currently for sale, so by that reckoning, it is undeniably the best.

Battery performance is pretty good too, only dropping around 35 percent on a three-hour walk on medium power. It drains quicker in the higher modes, however, and as mentioned earlier, I'd hate to have to carry it if the battery dies, so a spare is essential for longer multiday hikes.

But it's not perfect. It's easier to control the exoskeleton via the app, which involves repeatedly reaching for my phone as I change terrain. The onboard controls are simple—it's one button—but remembering which setting and how many single-press and double-press actions I've done isn't as intuitive as I'd like. Oh and once you're strapped in, accessing trouser pockets is difficult.

I was impressed by the overall comfort of the design, and while I'd love to be able to wear it under trousers, it's not that ostentatious. The raised battery and lower back section can interfere with backpacks, though, if they hang quite low. It's more a niggle than issue, but worth consideration.

Another niggle is the fact that you need to plug the whole system in to recharge, despite the battery being easily swappable. You can buy a charging dock for four batteries for $49, and spares for $99, but a simple battery-mounted USB-C port would be so much more convenient.

I'm also not convinced by the cycling and running modes. The biomechanics just don't feel natural. Maybe the AI will learn the difference in my stride or power, but for now it feels unnecessary. And of course, there's the heart rate tests which remain baffling.

I do like the Fitness mode, however, which adds resistance as you walk, making it harder, and increasing my effort. Ironically though, based on my data, it seems that all the modes do this as standard.

I still think the Hypershell Pro X can help you walk farther, especially on easier terrain, but as my tests show, it's not as useful if you're tackling difficult ascents. Maybe that's the point. Maybe it's not a device for already active people. Maybe it can find an audience of older, or less able individuals who are keen to get out and explore more but need a bit of help.

From my experience, exoskeletons continue to overpromise and underdeliver. The Hypershell Pro X is the best of a frustrating bunch, but it still feels disconnected from real-world needs. Why would able-bodied people spend big on a gadget to help their perfectly good legs? I have yet to see a single image of an elderly hiker wearing an exoskeleton. It's madness. These devices have the potential to be like ebikes for the less able, and they would be better pitched as such, rather than expensive toys for the already active.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","From Orwell 2+2=5 to Frankenstein : TIFF's Films on Power, Creation, and Survival Are a Warning","https://www.wired.com/story/from-orwell-225-to-frankenstein-tiffs-films-on-power-creation-and-survival-are-a-warning/","Sun, 14 Sep 2025 10:30:00 GMT","

Some of the most urgent films at this year's Toronto International Film Festival aren't here to soothe. Together, Orwell: 2+2=5, Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk, and Frankenstein play like sizzle reels of caution, and at their best, they're award-worthy symbols of alarm. These films, the first two of which are documentaries, don't just entertain—they confront fractured humanity, closeness and distance under Israel's siege of Gaza, and a creation we've set loose, growing beyond our control. That's the one muscle of film—to interrogate rather than facilitate.

Director Raoul Peck, who gave us 2016's I Am Not Your Negro, didn't make Orwell: 2+2=5 to feel like a documentary in the usual sense—it's a dare, the sort of blunt truth authoritarian regimes treat like contraband.

The film portrays a slow-creep march around authoritarianism, not from an academic distance, but as an unsettling, visceral lesson in the here and now. Picture British actor Damian Lewis reading George Orwell's final musings—his letters, essays, diaries—with an almost clinical cadence. These reflections are layered over raw, jarring images: Gaza in ruins, Donald Trump's distorted truths, and the online mechanics of misinformation that enable our tendencies to ignore the unimaginable.

“That's unfortunately our capacity … to forget, our capacity to repress,” says Peck, who was born in Haiti, a country shaped by authoritarian rule.

“Hitler wrote a book, Mein Kampf. He said exactly what he was going to do, and he did exactly what was written there. And yet the whole German society, the whole European society, did not believe him—they felt he was a joke.”

“They thought, well, we will control him. They thought, well, our modern world cannot go that far down. We cannot imagine genocide going on. But it was written,” he continues.

To that end, the film is less of an appeal to our sense of what we might already know than a critique of our numbness to it. Optically, it's haunting. Words such as “doublespeak” (language designed to obscure or mislead), “newspeak” (a controlled vocabulary to limit thought), “thoughtcrime” (the criminalization of dissenting ideas), and “freedom is slavery” (the manipulation of truth to enforce obedience) populate the screen, overlaid on contemporary images of conflict, political spectacle, and media manipulation.

Peck discovered Orwell through a kindred perspective. “Orwell grew up in the exterior of that world,” he says. “So his view and his analysis—I could find myself through that. I discovered Orwell as a brother, and that was an important connection because it was visceral. It was human.” For Peck, Orwell's essays, particularly “Why I Write,” revealed a writer's consciousness of his role in confronting injustice—a sensibility that informs every frame of Orwell: 2+2=5.

Infographics lay bare uncomfortable truths: the widening gap between the rich and the rest, and the contrast between government promises and Gaza's destruction. But it's not just about relaying facts—social media and AI shape what we believe and forget.

Peck frames Orwell in the digital age: “It's basically Orwell's world with the instruments to do it easier today. How can you manipulate? How can you gain power and control everything? Authoritarian terrorism means that you want to rewrite history. Now, with fake news, you rewrite history with a click. Just give a prompt and you've created a different path.” He stresses that Orwell's analysis was grounded in real regimes, not prophecy: “You just apply it to your current situation, and redo the analysis.”

In other words, the film forces us—beautifully, uncomfortably—to face what we'd rather deny: that a writer, equal parts truth and fiction teller, could imagine a future that now feels like our present. Our self-portrait is stitched not just from Orwell's sly warnings about power, but from the nightmare we still insist is only fiction.

“They flood you with information, with lies, action, arresting people in the streets, make you afraid,” adds Peck. “They terrorize, and you know, it's working. That's an incredible assault.”

Where Orwell: 2+2=5 warns us about the apathy toward authoritarianism, Farsi's Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk forces us to confront the daily realities of living under military control—specifically, in Gaza.

In early 2024, Iranian-born director Sepideh Farsi arrived in Cairo, notebooks of intention in hand, only to find Gaza's gates closed to her. A Palestinian refugee suggests she call Fatma Hassouna, a 24-year-old photographer in Gaza. Through her camera and voice, Farsi discovered the only window she could open.

“I have never had such a deep relationship with someone whom I've never met … this feeling of being blocked in a country you cannot leave,” Farsi tells WIRED. “Then it's just the magic of encounter, the human alchemy, and her smile was contagious.”

Put Your Soul plays out as more than a record of someone's life during the course of a brutal military siege; the war and the persistence of a single life are one and the same. It purports that genocide, and all that enables it, always seeks one thing: erasure. But Hassouna's smile, threading its way entirely through video calls and fractured connections over the course of 112 minutes, renders that goal impossible.

The opening shots of Hassouna and Farsi introducing themselves anchor the film in this perspective, which not only feels personal but very social. There are talks of dreams, of travelling to fashion shows, her hopes of the war ending, while Farsi occasionally interrupts and muses to Hassouna about the wanderings of her own household cat.

Through the film, Hassouna comes alive not just as a photographer but as a witness to life insisting itself into being. She sings, writes, and frames the world in small, stubborn flashes of beauty—sunsets, gestures, moments that flicker and hold. Israel's weight presses in, but in her eyes, and in her lens, you feel resilience not as heroism, but as a relentless survival.

Their conversations flicker in and out—bad connections, cut-offs, pixelated resolutions. Farsi embraced the glitches as part of the film's life, letting audiences feel her frustration and the strangeness of connecting with Gaza. “By keeping these pauses and disconnections, I'm conveying something very strange about the way we connect to Gaza, because Gaza is not reachable, and yet it is. It's like another planet.”

Making the film for Farsi was much like living in two worlds at once: recording Hassouna from afar, sure, but also being closely present as a friend, witness, and human being. “We were both in the process of filming and being filmed, kind of,” she reflects. “I had to remain natural, but also somehow controlled as a filmmaker. Because, of course, I needed to be able to react in the right way to her.”

The film, in that sense, is a strong picture of Palestinian humanity—something mainstream media outlets have historically failed to portray—as shown through Hassouna. But it's a reckoning film as well. As months pass, Farsi and Hassouna's conversations confront the harsh realities of life under siege: constant bombings, sniper fire, days without food, as told by Hassouna. Sometimes she forgets the questions, her attention slipping due to the toll of hunger, with Farsi always keeping her at the center.

“I did not want to include graphic images in Gaza or raw footage in this film. I had to concentrate on the human facing me in a different way,” says Farsi. “There is a virtue to show, and if we do not, how would people find out about it?”

Farsi remembers Hassouna's smile—playful, melancholy, in poetry or sunlight. Even in hunger or fatigue, she would smile. “Absolutely unforgettable, her smile,” adds Farsi.

Put Your Soul offers no tidy closure by the end of its run time—because there is none to give.

On April 16, 2025, just a day after the film's Cannes selection, Hassouna was killed with 10 family members, including her pregnant sister, in an Israeli airstrike on their home in Gaza City's Al-Tuffah neighborhood. Her death renders the film both as a memorial and an indictment.

As Farsi reflects, “When the film was finished, I thought that together we had achieved something. And then she was taken away and killed in a targeted and horrible way. I really travel a lot with the film, and it's weird to be presenting it alone without Fatim to talk about her in such an intense way. I'm there to kind of represent both of us.”

Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein puts creation under the microscope. Frankenstein isn't just about science and monsters; it's a haunting intersection of ambition and humanity. Like Mary Shelley before him, del Toro revives a tortured genius, where monstrosity and humanity are kin. Oscar Isaac's Victor Frankenstein sheds the simplicity of villainy, revealing the messy truths of a man who is both creator and creature.

As Del Toro told Variety at Cannes in May: “Somebody asked me the other day, does it have really scary scenes? For the first time, I considered that. It's an emotional story for me. It's as personal as anything. I'm asking a question about being a father, being a son … I'm not doing a horror movie—ever. I'm not trying to do that.”

Del Toro reanimates the well-worn tale of science gone unchecked and ambition outpacing our capacity to reckon. Gothic-darkened labs and ornate wardrobes frame the creature (Jacob Elordi), whose scars are smoothed, jawline sculpted—calibrated for sympathy. Del Toro doesn't revive Shelley's horror; he asks viewers to feel for a creation that should repel them.

To be clear, much of Frankenstein is theatrical as hell, balancing Shelley's lessons with the sentimental flourish of a Del Toro signature. It leans on familiar motifs of forgiveness and our capacity to self-correct, sometimes without fully earning these moments.

Again, Frankenstein is not an explicit message movie like the two above, but it is in Hollywood form, sounding an alarm during the in-between flashiness of a big studio film. Like Frankenstein, who stitched life from what should not live, we now hover on the edge of our own experiment, with AI promising to remake the world in ways that terrify, seduce, and elude our moral imagination.

Like Victor, who's warned about the dangers of his inner Prometheus by love interest Elizabeth Lavenza (Mia Goth), the architects of our artificial minds—the Sam Altmans, Demis Hassabis, Elon Musks—move in a space between awe and terror, crafting intelligences that mirror us back with uncanny precision, and with a threat that feels both abstract and immediate. They are our modern Frankensteins, not in horror but in the quiet, insistent way their creations compel reflection.

And yet it's the film's insistence on the creature's interiority that lingers. Elordi's Frankenstein is alive not only in body but in feeling, in gesture, in the way he occupies space as both product and probe of his maker's ambition. It forces us to reckon with the weight of creation, to sit with the responsibility of what we bring into being.

Frankenstein doesn't lecture on AI whatsoever. But in the shadow of ChatGPT, AlphaFold, and Neuralink, it's hard to miss an allegory that wouldn't apply to any other decade: the exhilaration of invention, the seduction of power, and the precariousness of a life—artificial or otherwise—that escapes our grasp, demanding we consider what it means to make, to care for, and to witness what we make and enable.

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

Imagine that someone gives you a list of five numbers: 1, 6, 21, 107 and—wait for it—47,176,870. Can you guess what comes next?

If you're stumped, you're not alone. These are the first five busy beaver numbers. They form a sequence that's intimately tied to one of the most notoriously difficult questions in theoretical computer science. Determining the values of busy beaver numbers is a daunting challenge that has attracted a cult following among both professional and amateur mathematicians for over 60 years.

Researchers identified the first four busy beaver numbers in the 1960s and 1970s. The conspicuously larger fifth number, called BB(5), was only definitively pinned down last year, by a team made up mostly of amateur mathematicians working together in an online community called the Busy Beaver Challenge.

No one knows how big BB(6) is. All we have are lower limits—truly staggering ones. In 2022 busy beaver hunters established that BB(6) must be, at a minimum, so large that it's literally impossible to write down in ordinary decimal notation. Even if you somehow carved a digit into every atom in the cosmos, you'd run out of atoms before making any measurable progress.

“It's way beyond anything that we could ever grasp or get our hands on,” said Scott Aaronson, a computer scientist at the University of Texas, Austin.

Busy beaver hunters have now discovered that this stupefyingly big number must be even bigger. The finding comes from one of the most mysterious and prolific contributors to the Busy Beaver Challenge, who proved a new lower limit on BB(6) in June and broke the record again a mere nine days later. The new results make the 2022 lower bound look positively puny.

“I keep on being surprised,” said William Gasarch, a computer scientist at the University of Maryland. “Six is getting us into the stratosphere of large numbers.”

The notoriously difficult question behind the busy beaver numbers is this: Given the code of a computer program, can you tell whether it will eventually stop or run forever?

In 1936, the pioneering logician Alan Turing proved that there's no universal procedure for answering this question, which became known as the halting problem. Any method that works for some programs will fail for others, and in some cases, no method will work.

Turing proved this seminal result by inventing a formal mathematical model of computation in which programs are represented by hypothetical devices now called Turing machines. Each Turing machine performs computations in discrete steps according to a unique list of simple rules. The more rules a Turing machine has, the more complex its behavior can get, and the harder it can be to determine whether it will halt.

But just how much harder? In 1962, the mathematician Tibor Radó invented a new way to explore this question through what he called the busy beaver game. To play, start by choosing a specific number of rules—call that number n. Your goal is to find the n-rule Turing machine that runs the longest before eventually halting. This machine is called the busy beaver, and the corresponding busy beaver number, BB(n), is the number of steps that it takes.

In principle, if you want to find the busy beaver for any given n, you just need to do a few things. First, list out all the possible n-rule Turing machines. Next, use a computer program to simulate running each machine. Look for telltale signs that machines will never halt—for example, many machines will fall into infinite repeating loops. Discard all these non-halting machines. Finally, record how many steps every other machine took before halting. The one with the longest runtime is your busy beaver.

In practice, this gets tricky. For starters, the number of possible machines grows rapidly with each new rule. Analyzing them all individually would be hopeless, so you'll need to write a custom computer program to classify and discard machines. Some machines are easy to classify: They either halt quickly or fall into easily identifiable infinite loops. But others run for a long time without displaying any obvious pattern. For these machines, the halting problem deserves its fearsome reputation.

The more rules you add, the more computing power you need. But brute force isn't enough. Some machines run for so long before halting that simulating them step by step is impossible. You need clever mathematical tricks to measure their runtimes.

“Technology improvements definitely help,” said Shawn Ligocki, a software engineer and longtime busy beaver hunter. “But they only help so far.”

Busy beaver hunters started chipping away at the BB(6) problem in earnest in the 1990s and 2000s, during an impasse in the BB(5) hunt. Among them were Shawn Ligocki and his father, Terry, an applied mathematician who ran their search program in the off hours on powerful computers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. In 2007, they found a six-rule Turing machine that broke the record for the longest runtime: The number of steps it took before halting had nearly 3,000 digits. That's a colossal number by any ordinary measure. But it's not too big to write down. In 12-point font, those 3,000 digits will just about cover a single sheet of paper.

In 2022, Shawn Ligocki discovered a six-rule Turing machine whose runtime has more digits than the number of atoms in the universe.

Three years later, a Slovakian undergraduate computer science student named Pavel Kropitz decided to tackle the BB(6) hunt as a senior thesis project. He wrote his own search program and set it up to run in the background on a network of 30 computers in a university lab. After a month he found a machine that ran far longer than the one discovered by the Ligockis—a new “champion,” in the lingo of busy beaver hunters.

“I was lucky, because people in the lab were already complaining about my CPU usage and I had to scale back a bit,” Kropitz wrote in a direct message exchange on the Busy Beaver Challenge Discord server. After another month of searching, he broke his own record with a machine whose runtime had over 30,000 digits—enough to fill about 10 pages.

Kropitz's machine held the BB(6) record for 12 years. Then, in May 2022, Shawn Ligocki started a new job where he had access to a powerful computer cluster, and he decided to try running his old code on newer hardware. Sure enough, he found a new champion that beat Kropitz's record. The discovery kicked off a flurry of activity. Twice in the span of two weeks, Ligocki announced a new champion on a busy beaver mailing list. Each time, Kropitz beat his record within three days. Ligocki remembers his father marveling at how Kropitz pulled it off.

“He was joking that he imagines Pavel has already solved BB(6),” Ligocki said. “Whenever we find a champion, he just goes and pulls out of his bag one that's a little bit bigger.”

But the last two machines that Ligocki and Kropitz discovered didn't run just a bit longer than the reigning champion—their runtimes were on an entirely new level.

To understand numbers this large, we need to go back to the familiar mathematics of addition and multiplication. Start by adding up n copies of a number—that's just the definition of multiplication by n. If you instead multiply n copies of a number, that's known as exponentiation. So what happens if you repeatedly exponentiate a number? That process defines a new operation called tetration, denoted by two arrows pointing up.

Tetration gets big fast. 10↑↑1 is just 10. But 10↑↑2 is 1010, or 10 billion, and 10↑↑3 is 10 raised to the 10-billionth power: a 1 followed by 10 billion zeros. To write out all the digits you'd need a stack of paper a thousand feet high. At 10↑↑4, you cross a symbolic threshold where it's no longer a matter of finding enough paper—there are far more digits than atoms in the universe.

When Ligocki beat Kropitz's record for the second time, it was with a six-rule Turing machine that ran for over 10↑↑5 steps before halting. Kropitz countered with a machine that ran for 10↑↑15 steps—that's a tower of tens 15 stories high. They'd left the familiar world of digits far behind.

“That was the end of an era,” Kropitz wrote over direct message.

It was also the end of an era in another respect. Until then, the busy beaver game had been a competition, and researchers mostly worked alone. Then the Busy Beaver Challenge was formed, ushering in a new age of collaboration.

The Busy Beaver Challenge was founded in 2022 by a computer science graduate student named Tristan Stérin with the express purpose of rigorously proving the true value of BB(5). In summer 2024 the group succeeded, with a key contribution from a mysterious newcomer known only by the pseudonym mxdys.

News of the result appeared in Quanta, where Katelyn Doucette, an undergraduate computer science student at Virginia Tech, happened to see it. She soon joined the Busy Beaver Challenge community, at first just dropping in to the Discord server from time to time. But in May she made an exciting discovery, and since then she's become one of the most active contributors to the BB(6) hunt. “I've just been kind of hooked,” she said. “It's such a beautiful set of problems.”

In the year since putting the finishing touches on the BB(5) proof, mxdys had steadily chipped away at the BB(6) problem, using sophisticated automated methods to classify all but a few thousand “holdout” machines. Doucette was rooting around in the list of holdouts when she found one that looked especially promising. Analyzing it further with some help from Shawn Ligocki, she discovered that its runtime was second only to that of Kropitz's reigning champion. What's more, Doucette's machine belonged to a class of machines known as shift overflow counters, which achieve long runtimes using a very different mechanism than Kropitz's champion.

“It's exciting to see that these busy beavers have found a new technology,” Ligocki said.

A few other busy beaver hunters had previously discovered shift overflow counters that halted after a long time, but Doucette's discovery made the team suspect that these machines were more plentiful than they'd realized. And if some of the first ones to be studied had come within striking distance of Kropitz's record, others would likely surpass it. Busy Beaver Challenge contributors rushed to analyze other shift overflow counters, but mxdys got there first. On June 16, they announced the discovery of a new champion that halted after 10↑↑107 steps—that is, its runtime is a tower of tens that's 10 million stories high. Writing this number down as a string of digits is out of the question. But even writing it as a tower of powers gets dicey: In 12-point font, that line of tens would stretch out for about 25 miles.

Kropitz, who saw the news while away on vacation, accepted the loss of his title graciously, writing in the Discord server, “unfortunately, i won't be performing my 3-day trick this time.” It helped that he had a consolation prize. A month earlier, he'd nabbed the record for the longest-running known seven-rule Turing machine. At least for now, Kropitz is still on the leaderboard.

The new record didn't last long. A week later, mxdys broke it again with a machine whose runtime is—yet again—on a qualitatively new level. To write it down in its most succinct form, we need to introduce an absurd mathematical operation called pentation, represented by three arrows pointing up. Pentation is repeated tetration—in other words, it bears the same relationship to tetration as tetration does to exponentiation.

The total number of steps that mxdys' new champion took before halting was greater than 2↑↑↑5, or 2↑↑(2↑↑(2↑↑(2↑↑2))). To unpack this expression, you work outward from the innermost parentheses: 2↑↑2 is 4, and 2↑↑4 is a bit over 65,000. That leaves you with 2↑↑(2↑↑65,000), making the height of the final stack of 2s an incomprehensibly large number. Forget about writing a tower of powers that stretches out for miles or megaparsecs. Even this more compact notation no longer fits in the universe.

This new result is still just a lower limit on BB(6)—the true value could be even higher. Busy beaver hunters don't expect to have a definitive answer anytime soon. The first sign of trouble was a monstrous six-rule Turing machine that the team has named Antihydra, discovered by mxdys last year.

Antihydra almost certainly never halts. But researchers haven't been able to prove it. And there's a good reason for that: A busy beaver hunter who goes by Racheline has shown that the question of whether Antihydra halts is closely related to a famous unsolved problem in mathematics called the Collatz conjecture. Since then, the team has discovered many other six-rule machines with similar characteristics. Slaying the Antihydra and its brethren will require conceptual breakthroughs in pure mathematics.

But to avid busy beaver hunters, that's no reason to be discouraged. There are still thousands of six-rule Turing machines to explore, each with its own rich behavior.

“For me, the most valid reason to do math is because it's fun. It is art,” Racheline wrote in a Discord direct message. “There will always be something new to do.”

Apple hosted its new hardware event today, releasing its iPhone 17 lineup, along with updates for the Apple Watch and AirPods. For the iPhone 17 models, updates included larger screens and an improved camera system, as well as the introduction of an ultra-thin iPhone Air that replaces the Plus model. 

And the company may be announcing more new hardware soon, with Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reporting that a new iPad Pro, an updated Vision Pro, updated AirTags, a new Apple TV, a new HomePod mini, and updated MacBooks are coming in either 2025 or the first half of 2026.

The iPhone 17 received a makeover to align more closely with the Pro models. It features a slightly larger 6.3-inch screen, which is an increase of 0.2 inches compared to the iPhone 16. It also has a 120 Hz display, a substantial upgrade from the current 60 Hz. The phone also has a 48-megapixel ultrawide camera.

It comes in new colors: lavender, mist blue, black, white, and sage.

The Pro's upgrades are mainly on the back of the phone. The three rear cameras are now arranged in a rectangular bar that extends from one edge of the device to the other. The flash, light sensor, and microphone are positioned far to the right side. Where the MagSafe charger is, the Apple logo is centered for aesthetic reasons.

Notably, the iPhone 17 Pro switched materials, replacing the titanium band around the screen with aluminum. 

The iPhone 17 starts at $799 and has a base storage of 256GB. In contrast, the iPhone 16 started at $699 for 128GB. The Pro model costs $1,099, and the Pro Max is $1,199.

While the event's primary focus was on the iPhones, Apple announced new phone cases as a bonus. Called “TechWoven” cases, these feature a higher quality woven material compared to the discontinued “FineWoven” line of fabric cases Apple released in 2023.

Missing from the keynote was any mention of an AI-enhanced Siri, which puts Apple way behind Google and its competitors.

The biggest announcement at the event was the debut of Apple's slimmest phone ever, the iPhone Air, which replaces the iPhone Plus. 

This device has a profile thickness of 5.6 mm, making it about 0.08 inches thinner than current iPhones. It also features a 6.6-inch screen and a 120 Hz ProMotion display. The device is eSIM only, which helps the product maintain its sleek design.

This move appears to be Apple's response to the trend of slimmer smartphones, following in the footsteps of other companies like Samsung and Huawei. The iPhone Air could potentially outshine the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which measures 5.8 mm thick. Additionally, it may pave the way for Apple's long-rumored foldable phone, predicted to launch in September 2026.

The device is priced at $999 and will be available in black, white, sky blue, and light gold. 

After a two-year wait, Apple announced the Apple Watch Ultra 3, which includes faster charging speeds, 5G support, and satellite connectivity. The watch also features a larger display. 

However, one of the most exciting upgrades for both the Ultra 3 and Series 11 is the incorporation of blood pressure-monitoring capabilities. This feature notifies users if their blood pressure levels are too high or too low. 

The third-generation Apple Watch SE, meanwhile, didn't receive major updates, aside from an always-on display, thanks to a faster S10 chip. 

Prices for the watches are $249 for the Apple Watch SE 3, $399 for the Series 11, and $799 for the Ultra 3.

After the release of the AirPods Pro 2 in 2022, it's about time for an upgrade. The AirPods Pro 3, priced at $249, features smaller earbuds, improved audio, and a new heart-rate-sensing feature. It also features live translation technology, powered by Apple Intelligence, to help users translate foreign languages in real time.

Google faces a new lawsuit accusing the company of illegally using news publishers' content to create AI summaries that damage their business.

The lawsuit comes from Penske Media Corporation (PMC), which owns industry publications such as Rolling Stone, Billboard, Variety, Hollywood Reporter, Deadline, Vibe, and Artforum. While Penske's suit is the first to target Google and its parent company Alphabet over showing AI-generated summaries in search, both publishers and authors have sued other AI companies over related copyright concerns.

“As a leading global publisher, we have a duty to protect PMC's best-in-class journalists and award-winning journalism as a source of truth,” said Penske Media CEO Jay Penske in a statement. “Furthermore, we have a responsibility to proactively fight for the future of digital media and preserve its integrity — all of which is threatened by Google's current actions.”

Since launching its AI Overviews last year, Google has been criticized for threatening the business models of the same publishers it relies on to provide the content needed to create accurate AI summaries and answers.

The new lawsuit goes farther by accusing Google of continuing to “wield its monopoly to coerce PMC into permitting Google to republish PMC's content in AI Overviews” and to use that content to train its AI models.

Google spokesperson José Castañeda said in a statement that AI Overviews make Google search “more helpful” and create “new opportunities for content to be discovered.”

“Every day, Google sends billions of clicks to sites across the web, and AI Overviews send traffic to a greater diversity of sites,” Castañeda said. “We will defend against these meritless claims.”

The lawsuit argues that while Penske Media allows Google to crawl its websites in an “exchange of access for traffic” that is “the fundamental bargain that supports the production of content for the open commercial Web,” Google has recently “begun to tie its participation in this bargain to another transaction to which PMC and other publishers do not willingly consent.”

“As a condition of indexing publisher content for search, Google now requires publishers to also supply that content for other uses that cannibalize or preempt search referrals,” the lawsuit claims, adding that the only way for Penske to opt out would be to remove itself from Google search entirely, which would be “devastating.”

The lawsuit also claims that Penske has seen “significant declines in clicks from Google searches since Google started rolling out AI Overviews.” That means less ad revenue for the publisher, and it also threatens subscription and affiliate revenue, the company says: “These revenue streams rely on people actually visiting PMC sites.”

And while Google has pushed back against complaints that AI Overviews reduce traffic to publishers, the lawsuit says, “Google has offered no credible competing information regarding search referral traffic.”

Penske's suit comes after Google seemingly dodged an antitrust bullet — while a federal judge had ruled the company acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search, the judge did not to order the company to break up its businesses (for example by selling Chrome), due in part to an increasing competition in AI.

This post has been updated with a statement from Jay Penske.

At the center of every empire is an ideology, a belief system that propels the system forward and justifies expansion – even if the cost of that expansion directly defies the ideology's stated mission.

For European colonial powers, it was Christianity and the promise of saving souls while extracting resources. For today's AI empire, it's artificial general intelligence to “benefit all humanity.” And OpenAI is its chief evangelist, spreading zeal across the industry in a way that has reframed how AI is built. 

“I was interviewing people whose voices were shaking from the fervor of their beliefs in AGI,” Karen Hao, journalist and bestselling author of “Empire of AI,” told TechCrunch on a recent episode of Equity. 

In her book, Hao likens the AI industry in general, and OpenAI in particular, to an empire. 

“The only way to really understand the scope and scale of OpenAI's behavior…is actually to recognize that they've already grown more powerful than pretty much any nation state in the world, and they've consolidated an extraordinary amount of not just economic power, but also political power,” Hao said. “They're terraforming the Earth. They're rewiring our geopolitics, all of our lives. And so you can only describe it as an empire.”

OpenAI has described AGI as “a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work,” one that will somehow “elevate humanity by increasing abundance, turbocharging the economy, and aiding in the discovery of new scientific knowledge that changes the limits of possibility.” 

These nebulous promises have fueled the industry's exponential growth — its massive resource demands, oceans of scraped data, strained energy grids, and willingness to release untested systems into the world. All in service of a future that many experts say may never arrive.

Hao says this path wasn't inevitable, and that scaling isn't the only way to get more advances in AI. 

“You can also develop new techniques in algorithms,” she said. “You can improve the existing algorithms to reduce the amount of data and compute that they need to use.”

But that tactic would have meant sacrificing speed. 

“When you define the quest to build beneficial AGI as one where the victor takes all — which is what OpenAI did — then the most important thing is speed over anything else,” Hao said. “Speed over efficiency, speed over safety, speed over exploratory research.”

For OpenAI, she said, the best way to guarantee speed was to take existing techniques and “just do the intellectually cheap thing, which is to pump more data, more supercomputers, into those existing techniques.”

OpenAI set the stage, and rather than fall behind, other tech companies decided to fall in line. 

“And because the AI industry has successfully captured most of the top AI researchers in the world, and those researchers no longer exist in academia, then you have an entire discipline now being shaped by the agenda of these companies, rather than by real scientific exploration,” Hao said.

The spend has been, and will be, astronomical. Last week, OpenAI said it expects to burn through $115 billion in cash by 2029. Meta said in July that it would spend up to $72 billion on building AI infrastructure this year. Google expects to hit up to $85 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, most of which will be spent on expanding AI and cloud infrastructure. 

Meanwhile, the goal posts keep moving, and the loftiest “benefits to humanity” haven't yet materialized, even as the harms mount. Harms like job loss, concentration of wealth, and AI chatbots that fuel delusions and psychosis. In her book, Hao also documents workers in developing countries like Kenya and Venezuela who were exposed to disturbing content, including child sexual abuse material, and were paid very low wages — around $1 to $2 an hour — in roles like content moderation and data labeling.

Hao said it's a false tradeoff to pit AI progress against present harms, especially when other forms of AI offer real benefits.

She pointed to Google DeepMind's Nobel Prize-winning AlphaFold, which is trained on amino acid sequence data and complex protein folding structures, and can now accurately predict the 3D structure of proteins from their amino acids — profoundly useful for drug discovery and understanding disease.

“Those are the types of AI systems that we need,” Hao said. “AlphaFold does not create mental health crises in people. AlphaFold does not lead to colossal environmental harms … because it's trained on substantially less infrastructure. It does not create content moderation harms because [the datasets don't have] all of the toxic crap that you hoovered up when you were scraping the internet.” 

Alongside the quasi-religious commitment to AGI has been a narrative about the importance of racing to beat China in the AI race, so that Silicon Valley can have a liberalizing effect on the world. 

“Literally, the opposite has happened,” Hao said. “The gap has continued to close between the U.S. and China, and Silicon Valley has had an illiberalizing effect on the world … and the only actor that has come out of it unscathed, you could argue, is Silicon Valley itself.”

Of course, many will argue that OpenAI and other AI companies have benefitted humanity by releasing ChatGPT and other large language models, which promise huge gains in productivity by automating tasks like coding, writing, research, customer support, and other knowledge-work tasks. 

But the way OpenAI is structured — part non-profit, part for-profit — complicates how it defines and measures its impact on humanity. And that's further complicated by the news this week that OpenAI reached an agreement with Microsoft that brings it closer to eventually going public.

Two former OpenAI safety researchers told TechCrunch that they fear the AI lab has begun to confuse its for-profit and non-profit missions — that because people enjoy using ChatGPT and other products built on LLMs, this ticks the box of benefiting humanity.

Hao echoed these concerns, describing the dangers of being so consumed by the mission that reality is ignored. 

“Even as the evidence accumulates that what they're building is actually harming significant amounts of people, the mission continues to paper all of that over,” Hao said. “There's something really dangerous and dark about that, of [being] so wrapped up in a belief system you constructed that you lose touch with reality.”

How much do foundation models matter?

It might seem like a silly question, but it's come up a lot in my conversations with AI startups, which are increasingly comfortable with businesses that used to be dismissed as “GPT wrappers,” or companies that build interfaces on top of existing AI models like ChatGPT. These days, startup teams are focused on customizing AI models for specific tasks and interface work, and see the foundation model as a commodity that can be swapped in and out as necessary. That approach was on display especially at last week's Boxworks conference, which seemed devoted entirely to the user-facing software built on top of AI models.

Part of what is driving this is that the scaling benefits of pre-training — that initial process of teaching AI models using massive datasets, which is the sole domain of foundation models — has slowed down. That doesn't mean AI has stopped making progress, but the early benefits of hyperscaled foundational models have hit diminishing returns, and attention has turned to post-training and reinforcement learning as sources of future progress. If you want to make a better AI coding tool, you're better off working on fine-tuning and interface design rather than spending another few billion dollars worth in server time on pre-training. As the success of Anthropic's Claude Code shows, foundation model companies are quite good at these other fields too — but it's not as durable an advantage as it used to be.

In short, the competitive landscape of AI is changing in ways that undermine the advantages of the biggest AI labs. Instead of a race for an all-powerful AGI that could match or exceed human abilities across all cognitive tasks, the immediate future looks like a flurry of discrete businesses: software development, enterprise data management, image generation and so on. Aside from a first-mover advantage, it's not clear that building a foundation model gives you any advantage in those businesses. Worse, the abundance of open-source alternatives means that foundation models may not have any price leverage if they lose the competition at the application layer. This would turn companies like OpenAI and Anthropic into back-end suppliers in a low-margin commodity business – as one founder put it to me, “like selling coffee beans to Starbucks.” 

It's hard to overstate what a dramatic shift this would be for the business of AI. Throughout the contemporary boom, the success of AI has been inextricable from the success of the companies building foundation models — specifically, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Being bullish on AI meant believing that AI's transformative impact would make these into generationally important companies. We could argue about which company would come out on top, but it was clear that some foundation model company was going to end up with the keys to the kingdom.

At the time, there were lots of reasons to think this was true. For years, foundation model development was the only AI business there was — and the fast pace of progress made their lead seem insurmountable. And Silicon Valley has always had a deep-rooted love of platform advantage. The assumption was that, however AI models ended up making money, the lion's share of the benefit would flow back to the foundation model companies, who had done the work that was hardest to replicate.

The past year has made that story more complicated. There are lots of successful third-party AI services, but they tend to use foundation models interchangeably. For startups, it no longer matters whether their product sits on top of GPT-5, Claude or Gemini, and they expect to be able to switch models in mid-release without end users noticing the difference. Foundation models continue to make real progress, but it no longer seems plausible for any one company to maintain a large enough advantage to dominate the industry.

We already have plenty of indication that there is not much of a first-mover advantage. As venture capitalist Martin Casado of a16z pointed out on a recent podcast, OpenAI was the first lab to put out a coding model, as well as generative models for image and video — only to lose all three categories to competitors. “As far as we can tell, there is no inherent moat in the technology stack for AI,” Casado concluded.

Of course, we shouldn't count foundation model companies out just yet. There are still lots of durable advantages on their side, including brand recognition, infrastructure, and unthinkably vast cash reserves. OpenAI's consumer business may prove harder to replicate than its coding business, and other advantages may emerge as the sector matures. Given the fast pace of AI development, the current interest in post-training could easily reverse course in the next six months. Most uncertain of all, the race toward general intelligence could pay off with new breakthroughs in pharmaceuticals or materials science, radically shifting our ideas about what makes AI models valuable.

But in the meantime, the strategy of building ever-bigger foundation models looks a lot less appealing than it did last year — and Meta's billion-dollar spending spree is starting to look awfully risky.

Welcome back! Did you miss me? Yes, of course you did. There is a lot of “future of transportation” news to keep track of. Let's jump in. 

It's comeback week, and not just because I have returned from vacation. I'm talking about the biennial IAA Mobility conference in Munich and the purposeful effort among German automakers to show the world it can still offer compelling, technologically advanced, and affordable vehicles. The subtext of the splashy event that started Tuesday: “Hey, China, we're not out of the race.”

VW Group, Mercedes, and BMW all showcased numerous new vehicles, including electric ones. And executives made their battle cries: VW Group Oliver Blume struck a bullish tone in a few interviews with reporters and laid out the company's plan to be competitive in China, particularly with EVs, a category where VW has lagged.

But what about on the home front? Chinese automakers have been pushing into Europe, and consumers have responded. The German automakers are hoping their latest products — including a new all-electric Mercedes GLC, the BMW iX3 with its four “superbrain” computers, and the Volkswagen ID Polo and ID Cross concept — will preserve and even grow market share. But they have some work to do. Chinese companies like BYD almost doubled their market share in Europe over the past year, JATO Dynamics reported in July.

One other IAA news item of note: Rimac Technology, the tech and parts unit of Rimac Group, has developed solid-state battery packs it says will be available by late 2027. These batteries apparently pack in the energy and can be charged from 10% to 80% in under 10 minutes.

Hyundai appears to still be committed to Motional, according to two little birds who have shared new investment information with me. 

Hyundai and Aptiv had created a joint venture (called Motional) with an agreement to invest $4 billion in the effort. Aptiv backed out in early 2024, leaving Hyundai to either invest its own money, find other outside partners, or shutter the program altogether. Hyundai opted to invest $1 billion — $475 million directly into Motional as part of a broader deal that includes buying out joint venture partner Aptiv. Hyundai agreed to spend another $448 million to buy 11% of Aptiv's common equity interest in Motional.

Now it appears Hyundai is investing more into Motional in two tranches. The first is being dispersed this year and is about $452 million. The second comes next year, and I'm still trying to nail down that amount. That first figure is in line with reporting from a Korean outlet. Hyundai declined (a couple of times!) to respond to my questions about the funding. That's pretty typical for large corporations to stay mum. However, one little bird who is deep within the AV industry also noted that Hyundai might not want to make a big deal about this, considering it's also working with Waymo. 

In other little bird chirpings, there are two new hires at General Motors that you might find interesting. Sony Mohapatra, the former senior manager of AI compute platforms at Cruise, has landed as director of AI and machine learning engineering at General Motors. And Paul Menson, who was the senior staff account manager of Megapack at Tesla, is now director of energy storage systems business development at General Motors.

Via, the transit software startup that garnered attention for its consumer-facing on-demand shuttle service, has made its IPO debut. The company, as I have mentioned before, has been batting around plans for an IPO for years. 

Earlier this year, it filed confidentially for an IPO — the second time it took this step. But this time, Via took the big IPO leap. The company, which is known for its Citymapper mobile navigation app, said it sold 10.7 million shares for $46 per share. In all, Via raised $492.9 million at a $3.7 billion valuation. That's just slightly above its $3.5 billion valuation that it garnered back in 2023 during its last venture raise. 

We had to wrap up this newsletter before it officially began trading, but I'll be back next week with an update. 

Other deals that got my attention …

Arc Boats, the Los Angeles startup founded in 2021 by former SpaceX employees, signed a $160 million contract with Curtin Maritime for new hybrid-electric tugs, which are expected to hit the waters around the Los Angeles port in 2027. 

LeydenJar, the Netherlands-based battery materials startup, raised €13 million ($15.2 million) in a round led by Extantia and Invest-NL.

Standard Fleet, a fleet management software company, raised $13 million in a Series A round led by Nova Threshold with participation from WEX Venture Capital, SNR, Garry Tan (CEO of Y Combinator), Salil Deshpande (Uncorrelated Ventures), and Apoorv Bhargava (WeaveGrid). Returning investors included Burst Capital, Canvas Ventures, Liquid 2, Night Capital, Olive Capital, UP2398, and Danny Wen.

The Federal Aviation Administration announced a new pilot program that will let electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) startups test some operations before they receive full regulatory certification.

Hyundai's once-buzzy electric air taxi startup Supernal is having trouble getting off the ground. The company paused work on its aircraft program after a rocky few months that saw staff cuts and the departure of its CEO and CTO, two people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.

InDrive, the Mountain View-based startup that got its start in Siberia and is known for its bidding-based ride-hailing model across Asia and Latin America, wants to be a global super app. Here's what and where it's targeting.

Jaguar Land Rover said a cyberattack brought vehicle assembly lines to a standstill.

Lyft and May Mobility have launched a robotaxi service in Atlanta, the first commercial deployment in the two companies' partnership.

Nevada's Occupational Safety and Health Administration opened an investigation after a Boring Company employee sustained a “crushing injury” working on one of its tunnels in Las Vegas. Work has stopped at the site.

Tesla has the proper permit to begin testing autonomous vehicle technology on public roads in Nevada. As I explain in this article, securing a testing permit in the state is straightforward and easy. (Just fill out the registry form, and make sure you have the proper $5 million insurance coverage.) Tesla will still need to complete the self-certification process to be able to roll out an entire program. And it will need separate approval to operate a commercial ride-hailing service. 

Uber and Chinese autonomous vehicle startup Momenta plan to start testing robotaxis in Munich starting in 2026.

The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Uber, accusing the ride-hailing company of violating federal law by discriminating against people with physical disabilities.

TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 is right around the corner — in around six weeks or so. And we have some high-profile folks from the transportation world coming onto our stage at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. The event, which will be held October 27 to 29, will include Wayve co-founder and CEO Alex Kendall, Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana, and Flexport founder and CEO Ryan Petersen. And more are coming. Stay tuned.

You can buy tickets here. And be sure to check out our Startup Battlefield 200, a pretty incredible list of startups that will be exhibiting — and some pitching on the main stage.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:ycombinator.com","Graphene just broke a fundamental law of physics","https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45237380","Sun, 14 Sep 2025 04:46:31 GMT","

> Abstract: [...] Here we have discerned the quantum critical universality in graphene transport by combining the electrical and thermal conductivities in very high-quality devices close to the Dirac point. We find that they are inversely related, as expected from relativistic hydrodynamics, and the characteristic conductivity converges to a quantized value. We also observe a giant violation of the Wiedemann–Franz law, where the Lorentz number exceeds the semiclassical value by more than 200 times close to the Dirac point at low temperatures. At high temperatures, the effective dynamic viscosity to entropy density ratio close to the Dirac point in the cleanest devices approaches that of a minimally viscous quantum fluid within a factor of four.

Reading the Wikipedia page I don't get the sense the law is quite as fundamental as the headline and summary make it sound like.Here's one of the previous violations:In 2011, N. Wakeham et al. found that the ratio of the thermal and electrical Hall conductivities in the metallic phase of quasi-one-dimensional lithium molybdenum purple bronze Li0.9Mo6O17 diverges with decreasing temperature, reaching a value five orders of magnitude larger than that found in conventional metals obeying the Wiedemann–Franz law. This due to spin-charge separation and it behaving as a Luttinger liquid.Still, graphene is cool and seems to be the gift that keeps on giving in terms of surprising results in solid state physics.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiedemann%E2%80%93Franz_law#Li...

Normal carbon stacks into a hexagonal ABAB pattern.For superconductivity, the layers need to be at least ABC (because twisted bilayer graphene does not demonstrate the effects (superconductivity, quantum hall effect) at room temperature FWIU).Current process: CVD chemical vapor decomposition and then sort and stack graphene flakes.Flash heating plastic yields graphene and hydrogen; but you must capture the flue.There are new plastic recycling methods that intentionally don't produce graphene that maybe could produce more plastic and graphene.But graphene is hazardous sort of like coal ash; so IIUC if you can make graphene onsite (e.g. from unsorted 'recycled' plastics) and lock it in to glass or another substrate that avoids transport risks.

A ton more programs, especially one-shot programs that operate on a single batch input (e.g. a directory of files) and then generate some output—like a ZIP copy of the files for your static site—should offer this but unfortunately don't.  At best they'll put out an Electron app for cross-platform compatibility, but it doesn't sidestep the problem of granting overbroad capabilities to NPM modules (or the massive memory footprint).  Then, in this case, there's Observable Desktop, which as a Mac-only app, falls short even of that mark.1. <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44229684>

SpaceX's has been partnering with mobile carriers like T-Mobile to offer its satellite internet service Starlink to extend the reach of cell networks. But, according to a report from the Washington Post, the company has ambitions to be more than just a partner. Following a major purchase of wireless spectrum earlier this week, it appears everyone is expecting Elon Musk's company to get into the wireless network business for itself.

On Monday, it was reported that SpaceX was finalizing a deal with satellite communications company EchoStar, the parent company of Dish Network, to buy up $17 billion worth of wireless spectrum. All signs suggest that SpaceX is after that spectrum to help build out Starlink's 5G network, with the rumored goal to move satellite connectivity for phones beyond just emergency services and access in remote locations to a full-blown mobile network.

Musk hasn't exactly backed away from the rumors. In an appearance on the All-In Podcast, he claimed the newly acquired spectrum would allow the company to deliver “high-bandwidth connectivity” directly from satellites to connected devices, albeit with a two-year lead time to get everything set up. “The net effect is you should be able to watch videos anywhere on your phone,” he said. That's a big jump from Starlink's current network offerings, which is currently only used for sending and receiving texts. The company claims it'll offer voice calls soon. And that two-year timeline? Take it with a grain of salt, given Musk's longstanding history of overpromising, but it does at least give some clarity as to his company's end goal.

As for starting up a network to compete with AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon, Musk didn't rule it out when talking to the All-In guys, who are always more than happy to drink the Kool-Aid unprompted. Musk said that purchasing a mobile network provider like Verizon in the future is “not out of the question.” According to The Washington Post's reporting, Starlink likely doesn't have the spectrum to compete in urban environments where volume is massive and competitors have the infrastructure advantage when it comes to handling that traffic. So getting into those spaces may require an acquisition rather than building its own network.

If Musk and SpaceX were to go that route, it's unlikely they would face regulatory hurdles under the current administration. As WaPo pointed out, Brendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission appointed by Donald Trump, called SpaceX's spectrum purchase a “potential game changer” for mobile networks. You're probably not going to see an in-depth review of potential antitrust concerns when the top cop on the beat has pom-poms in his hands.

Nintendo doesn't normally let fans in on its hardware plans, but if you're the type of person to spot trends, it's clear the Switch 2 will become the Mario maker's everything console. Nintendo has started offering more hardware specifically tailored for playing its old, defunct consoles. The inevitable next step is for the company to let us return to its most popular handheld ever, the Nintendo DS.

Today, Nintendo decided it was time to bring back what is likely its least popular gaming hardware it ever released. The $100 Virtual Boy for Switch 2 revives Nintendo's first use of stereoscopic visuals and the odd bipod-mounted headset for playing them. That modernized system is a relic—a blast from the past—that makes use of the Switch handheld hardware as the screen. While Nintendo has been releasing new controllers routinely for its Nintendo Classics list from the NES all the way up to the latest revitalized GameCube controller, this is the first instance of a specific device to feel authentic—as if you're thrown back to 1995 and playing the weird 3D console for the first time.

See Nintendo Switch 2 at Amazon

See Nintendo Switch 2 at Walmart

While the Virtual Boy was Nintendo's worst-selling console ever—only managing to move 770,000 units in its lifetime—the company's top-selling device is still MIA from the Nintendo Classics list. The Nintendo DS first launched in 2004 but hit its stride with the DS Lite in 2006. Over its lifespan, Nintendo sold 154 million units. The company's next-best-selling device, the original Switch, has sold 153.10 million.

Back in 2023, Nintendo filed a patent with the U.S. Patent Office that gave us a glimpse of how a supposed device with a large screen could attach to a handheld. Last month, Mike Odyssey on X spotted that Nintendo had updated the patent for 2025. The attached screen would be positioned at an “incline,” according to the patent, and doesn't describe a hinge system for the top screen to fold down onto the handheld, so this attachment would need to be removed and transported separately if you were to take the Switch 2 on the road.

Patents don't suggest a company will actually make the product, only that they're exploring ideas and want to protect them. Even if Nintendo is working on a dual-screen add-on for the Switch 2, that doesn't necessarily mean the finished product would look anything like this proposed design. Now that Nintendo has gone back 30 years to its strangest console, it opens the possibility of winding back the clock to every instance of its past hardware. The one missing piece, beyond the Wii and Wii U (at least Super Mario Galaxy is getting another remaster), is the Nintendo DS and the less-popular 3DS.

The Switch 2 has more capacity for these peripherals thanks to its top and bottom USB-C ports. A move toward more Switch 2 retro peripherals makes more sense when you understand why Nintendo keeps publishing its classic library for Switch owners. Retro emulators, which recreate older consoles as software, are growing increasingly popular with the generation of gamers who grew up with Nintendo's older consoles. Nintendo is also one of the few companies that rails hardest against emulation in its crusade to combat piracy and protect its intellectual property. Nintendo has taken down multiple Switch emulators, including Ryujinx, Citra, and—especially—Yuzu. Nintendo has hindered GameCube emulator Dolphin from a full release on Steam. The company offers its own emulation through its Nintendo Classics list as an alternative to the legion of players jumping at the burgeoning retro handheld scene.

And it couldn't come soon enough. While players have too much choice for Game Boy-like devices, the DS and 3DS are still new territory. In the last few months, Ayaneo showed off its Pocket DS, a dual-screen Android handheld made for playing DS games. Fellow handheld maker AYN announced its Thor dual-screen device as well. Meanwhile, Retroid crafted its own $69 dual-screen add-on for its horizontally oriented handhelds to play two-screen games. Nintendo will take its time to launch even more hardware. The company rolls out its games over time, so those wanting to return to the DS glory days will have to wait for something official.

A recent Congressional hearing revealed video of a Hellfire missile fired by a Reaper drone “bouncing off” an unidentified flying object, which has onlookers—Congress included—scratching their heads. The hearing took place in a House Oversight subcommittee meeting on UFO transparency that was partially hosted by MAGA congresswoman and state-sanctioned UFO investigator Rep. Anna Paulina Luna.

The video sure is, uh, something. As Fox News melodramatically puts it:

A House hearing on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) stunned lawmakers when video evidence showed a U.S. drone firing a Hellfire missile at an orb off Yemen—only for the object to remain intact and keep moving, raising urgent questions about technology beyond known military capabilities.

The video was first shared publicly by Rep. Eric Burlison (R-Missouri), who noted that it was “taken [on] October 30 of 2024″ and characterized it as an “MQ-9 drone tracking an orb or this object off the coast of Yemen.” Burlison said the footage is “presented as received from a whistleblower. Independent review is ongoing.”

Below is the video I revealed in our @GOPoversight UAP hearing today, made available to the public for the first time.

October 30th, 2024: MQ-9 Reaper allegedly tracking orb off coast of Yemen. 

Greenlight given to engage, missile appears to be ineffective against the target.… pic.twitter.com/jxJwl0e00S

— Rep. Eric Burlison (@RepEricBurlison) September 9, 2025



Calling this “orb” a UFO seems like a stretch, since it likely had something to do with the regional military conflicts around Yemen, where the footage was captured. But hey, it is a flying object that hasn't been identified.

A few years ago, UFOs were re-branded as UAP (unidentified aerial phenomenon). The rebrand was, like most rebrands, followed by a re-launch of the core product (in this case, UFO stories), and an attempted cultural re-glow-up. By that I mean, there's been a concerted effort to make UFOs “a thing” again, and Rep. Luna has been at the forefront of those efforts. Luna's recently launched “Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets” has been designed to resurrect many controversial “conspiracy theory”-tinged topics, UFOs included. Luna also hosted a hearing that featured claims made by supposed UFO whistleblower David Grusch.

What does the above video actually show? Your guess is as good as mine. I doubt it shows a time-traveling entity from another realm or an extraterrestrial spacecraft (both things that people who have spoken at Luna's various hearings have offered as potential explanations for recent UFO sightings). However, one thing of material substance revealed at this hearing is that the U.S.'s unmanned aerial cadres are now being deployed to shoot unidentified objects out of the sky. The War Zone writes, of the recently released footage:

The footage and the circumstances behind it are otherwise unconfirmed, but this appears to be the first known instance of a Reaper engaging an aerial target of any kind in an operational setting…The idea of employing MQ-9s in the air-to-air role, at least for self-defense, is not new. In a test in 2017, a Reaper successfully downed a target drone using an AIM-9X Sidewinder air-to-air missile. There was a precedent already at that time for arming drones in this way, with at least some Predators having been modified to allow them to fire heat-seeking Stingers in the lead-up to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. In at least one instance in 2002, a Predator fired a Stinger at an Iraqi MiG-25 Foxbat fighter that was trying to shoot it down…

A story about a hostile engagement between aliens and a drone would, of course, be more interesting, but the evolution of unmanned aerial defense systems is pretty interesting, too. On that front, our flying killer robots just seem to keep getting better and better. That's good news, I suppose, until the day one happens to come after you.

If you're a Samsung fan and you see “FE” branding, you probably think a few things. The first thing that comes to mind is probably, “I'm saving some money.” For those not fluent in Samsung lingo, FE, which is actually short for “Fan Edition,” is the equivalent of SE in Apple-speak, meaning it's a more budget-friendly alternative to the flagship-level gadgets. But it's not just savings you want when you're seeking something FE-branded—you want quality, too. Maybe you're not expecting every bell and whistle in the wheelhouse, but you want a lot of it.

I want a lot of the good stuff, too, and I don't want to pay for it, which is why when I got my hands on Samsung's recently released Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 FE, my expectations were elevated. And at $150, they might be even more elevated than usual. It's not that $150 is too much money in the world of wireless earbuds, it's that there are a ton of competitors in that range, and a lot of them punch above their weight class—the OnePlus Buds 4, Nothing's Ear, and Google's Pixel Buds 2a, for example.

So, the next logical question is how do the Galaxy Buds 3 FE hold up against competition, and if we already know there are compromises built in, what exactly are they? On that front, I've got good news and bad. Let's start with the good stuff.

Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 FE

Samsung's newest Galaxy Buds 3 FE wireless earbuds sound good but lag in some key departments.

Pros

Cons

I won't mince words; I really like how the Galaxy Buds 3 FE sound. For wireless earbuds in this price range, they sound (at the risk of hyperbole) shockingly good. They don't have as much bass as some competitors like OnePlus and its recent pair, the OnePlus Buds 4, but I personally don't mind that at all—I don't key in on bass when it comes to wireless earbuds. I'm more likely to appreciate buds that mitigate distortion, and I would describe the Galaxy Buds 3 FE as pleasantly unmuddled.

See Galaxy Buds3 FE at Amazon

See Galaxy Buds3 FE at Samsung

I find that, despite being less bassy, the Galaxy Buds 3 FE have a really natural soundstage, with clear mids and highs, which make vocals feel audible and present, and accompanying music distinct. I tested the Galaxy Buds 3 FE back-to-back against the OnePlus Buds 4, listening to the new Gorillaz single, “The Happy Dictator,” and the experience was kind of jarring, but I think I prefer Samsung's audio tuning. I could hear vocals upfront, background vocals felt artfully tucked away, arpeggiated synths occupied their own rightful space in the mid and high range, and I didn't detect much distortion even with the volume turned almost all the way up. If you emphasize bass, you'll most likely disagree with me, but the Galaxy Buds 3 FE are my preference.

So, there's the highlight—the sound. But what about the stuff you may not like? For me, it's the active noise cancellation (ANC). As much as I like listening with the Galaxy Buds 3 FE when I'm in a relatively quiet environment, I find that the appeal withers slightly in the cacophony of New York City living. One of the biggest tests you can put a pair of ANC wireless earbuds through is New York's subway system—a gauntlet that I send almost every pair of wireless earbuds and headphones through—and in this case, I would say the Galaxy Buds 3 FE barely pass the test. When a train arrives, I basically can't hear what I'm listening to, and even while I'm riding the subway, I'm still getting a decent amount of ambient noise from my environment.

I don't think that it's a passive noise cancellation issue—the default eartips feel comfortable—but even if it were, the Galaxy Buds 3 FE also only come with two tip sizes, which is notably less than other similarly priced competitors, which offer between three and five sizes. I'll give Samsung a little slack here if just because the last pair of ANC wireless earbuds that I tested are Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen), which cost $300 and are designed specifically to cancel the heck out of all the noise around you. They're the best at noise cancelling of any wireless earbuds I've put in my ears. But still, I was expecting more from Samsung, especially when I had no such complaints about the OnePlus Buds 4.

While the Galaxy Buds 3 FE are fine for mild instances of noise cancellation—they're mostly fine on the sidewalk in New York when I'm walking place to place—they're not the wireless earbuds I would spring for on an airplane or during a loud New York City subway commute.

You've got the good and the not-so-good, but what about the in-between? There are levels to this stuff, after all. I think the best encapsulation of things that are just fine in these wireless earbuds is the squeeze and touch controls. They're not the best I've ever used, but they're very okay. Interestingly, Samsung includes two types of controls on the Galaxy Buds 3 FE. To adjust volume, you swipe up or down on the buds, while skipping tracks, pause/play, and turning ANC on and off are done through squeezing. Like any squeeze controls, you'll have to adjust to the sensitivity at first, but once you do, they work fine for the most part.

I say “the most part” because I do find—because the Galaxy Buds 3 FE are so light—that squeezing them does jostle them in my ear a bit. They're not flying out mid-commute or anything, but squeezing does feel marginally more tenuous than on other pairs of wireless earbuds. Adding to that tenuousness, I think, is Samsung's “blade” design, which is borrowed from its flagship Galaxy Buds 3 Pro for this version of the FE. My complaint doesn't have anything to do with how the blade design copies AirPods—I actually like the look of the Galaxy Buds 3 FE—but one thing I don't like is how it feels on my fingers.

Because of the way the buds are situated when they're in your ears, the edge of the blade faces forward, which means when you go to squeeze, you may actually be squeezing a sharp angle, which (while not the biggest problem in the world) just doesn't feel altogether right. I'd much rather squeeze a flat surface (a flatter stem with a bigger surface area). It's a small tactile detail in the scheme of things, but as long as we're getting nerdy about this stuff, it's worth mentioning.

Though I don't love the feel of the blade design, I do actually like the look. They're plain in the scheme of things, but I find them kind of elegant. I also like how they appear when they're in my ears, though the blade is a decent length and can sometimes end up sticking out if I don't properly put them in my ears. Haters will say that the blade design is just an AirPods ripoff, and congrats, haters, you're right. That being said, AirPods look nice (if a little boring), in my opinion, and I think that Samsung does a good job of putting a little twist on the Apple minimalism.

In keeping with the theme of the section, the battery life of the Galaxy Buds 3 FE is also just okay. The buds are rated for 6 hours of battery life while ANC is activated and 8.5 hours when it's turned off, and with my usage, those estimates seem accurate. With the charging case, the total hours of battery is up to 24 hours with ANC on and up to 30 hours with it off. That's about the same battery you'd get with most wireless earbuds in this price range, give or take a half hour or so. Sorry folks, if the longest battery life is a priority, you'll just have to spend more money on wireless earbuds.

Feature-wise, the Galaxy Buds 3 FE are decently equipped but not brimming. You get adaptive ANC, 360 audio (Samsung's version of spatial audio), transparency mode, and you can choose EQ presets in the Galaxy Wearable app, but there's no personalized tuning test like there is on the OnePlus Buds 4 or Nothing Ear. That last one is a bit of a bummer since personalized EQ can dramatically change the sound quality in my experience.

Feature-rich or not, the Galaxy Buds 3 FE are still nice-sounding buds at a fairly affordable price. I think Samsung has room to improve in the ANC department, though, and if you're looking for the most of anything, going FE just isn't the way. But if you like Samsung's Galaxy products and you're more focused on quality sound over anything else, these might be your pick without costing too much.

Revised spec now being sampled by Micron, Samsung, and SK.

Nvidia has reportedly cancelled its first-gen SOCAMM (System-on-Chip Attached Memory Module) rollout and is shifting development focus to a new version known as SOCAMM2. This is according to Korean outlet ETNews  citing unnamed industry sources. Based on a machine translation, the outlet claims that SOCAMM1 was halted after technical setbacks and that SOCAMM2 sample testing is now underway with all three major memory vendors.

The abandonment of SOCAMM1, if accurate, resets what was expected to be a fast-tracked rollout of modular LPDDR-based memory in Nvidia's data center stack. SOCAMM has been positioned as a new class of high-bandwidth, low-power memory for AI servers, delivering similar benefits to HBM but at a lower cost.

Nvidia itself has already listed SOCAMM in product documentation. Its GB300 NVL72 spec sheet confirms support for up to 18TB of LPDDR5X-based SOCAMM and bandwidths of 14.3 TB/s.

Micron announced that it was the “first and only memory company” shipping SOCAMM products for AI servers in the data center back in March. In contrast, Samsung and SK hynix had stated in conference calls that they were getting ready for mass production in Q3 2025. If SOCAMM1 has truly been shelved as the unnamed sources claim, then the timing could give Samsung and SK a second shot to close the gap with Micron.

ETNews suggests that SOCAMM2 will boost data rates from 8,533 MT/s to 9,600 MT/s and may support LPDDR6, though no vendor has confirmed that yet. Industry reports from earlier this summer forecasted 600,000 to 800,000 SOCAMM units shipping this year, suggesting that Nvidia was serious about deploying SOCAMM1 at scale. Whether those plans were paused or simply evolving remains unclear.

Nvidia has not commented on the report — and never comments on rumors in any case — and none of the memory vendors have confirmed a change in direction. But with demand for AI memory exploding, and HBM supply becoming more and more constrained, SOCAMM is shaping up to become a major component in Nvidia's silicon roadmap, making a jump from SOCAMM1 to SOCAMM2 a feasible move.

Investigation appears to target 40nm interface and gate-driver ICs as import volumes rise and prices fall ahead of new U.S.–China trade talks.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


China has launched an anti-dumping investigation into American-made analog chips, claiming U.S. manufacturers have undercut local vendors on price while flooding the market with mature-node parts. The move targets essential low-end ICs used in PC boards, routers, PSUs, and other gear assembled in China, and comes just as U.S. and Chinese officials prepare to meet for a fresh round of trade talks in Madrid.

The investigation, initiated by the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) on September 13, covers interface and gate-driver ICs built on legacy processes at 40nm or larger. That includes the likes of RS-485 and CAN transceivers, digital isolators, I2C expanders, and the gate-driver chips used in voltage regulator modules to switch power to CPUs, GPUs, and other high-draw components. China's filing confirms the HS code and details the specific categories being probed.

Beijing claims imports of these parts from the U.S. rose 37% between 2022 and 2024, while the average price dropped 52%, a collapse it says hurt the domestic industry. The petitioner, an industry group based in Jiangsu Province, is requesting that duties be applied. The review period encompasses transactions during 2024, with an injury window extending back three years.

To date, most of the semiconductor battle between the two countries has centered on advanced AI chips and cutting-edge fabs, but this case drills into the commodity components sitting at the core of every motherboard. A duty regime could prompt Chinese factories to pay more for U.S.-origin analog chips, switch to domestic alternatives, or pivot to other non-U.S. vendors. Any of these things could ripple into minor BOM changes and redesigns for 2026 product cycles.

In parallel, China also announced an “anti-discrimination” investigation into alleged U.S. trade practices that limit Chinese chipmakers' ability to compete abroad. That inquiry will look into whether Washington's export controls and investment bans violate global trade norms. A typical timeline suggests that it'll take roughly three months for the inquiry to complete.

The analog pricing collapse may complicate Beijing's claims. Texas Instruments, one of the largest U.S. suppliers affected, slashed prices in 2023 in an attempt to defend its share in the Chinese market. But the broader market trend post-COVID was already one of heavy correction, with oversupply driving down margins across the mature-node segment.

MOFCOM says the anti-dumping case will conclude by September 13, 2026, though it can be extended by another six months if needed. Provisional duties, if imposed, could land well before then.

TSMC branded honey is available in several flavors, depending on the flora around a particular fab.

TSMC has worked with local beekeepers in Taiwan to produce ‘Ji Mi' – TSMC branded honey. The production of this golden, viscous, and culinary important liquid has become possible around the world's largest contract chipmaker fabs in Taiwan thanks to extensive environmental and sustainability efforts by the company. Sources: Liberty Times and Mirror Daily (machine translated).

On Friday, TSMC presented at the ‘2025 Asia Pacific Sustainability Expo - Co-Prosperity x Growth Forum.' At the event, its SVP of Corporate Sustainability, Ho Li-mei, claimed TSMC's commitment to ecological integration has reaped very worthwhile, and some surprising, dividends.

The prime example, as per our headline, is that bees have returned to the local ecosystem around TSMC's massive manufacturing facilities. Bees came naturally after the restoration of plant species chosen for their suitability, after environmental surveys. Now TSMC is collaborating with local beekeepers and Tunghai University to produce TSMC-exclusive honey – ‘Ji Mi.'

 




Other signs that nature's balance has been restored around TSMC fabs are the return of native Taiwanese species like the silver goby in waters around the plants. It is also claimed that TSMC is the first semiconductor producer in Taiwan to have fireflies living on the site. Fireflies are notoriously fussy about the environments they inhabit in Taiwan.

Tom's Hardware regulars will be aware of TSMC's previous concerns about water supplies. This resource pressure, and the need for TSMC to be particularly eco-friendly, given Taiwan's rather small size, may have been instrumental to the surprising eco-dividends we are now seeing around its fabs.

At the Expo, Ho Li-mei mentioned that TSMC has made major inroads in managing precious resources in the water-intensive semiconductor industry. Thanks to specialized resource management, water recycling at new facilities has been increased to over 90%, it is claimed.

As resources are carefully conserved, semiconductor manufacturing waste is being reduced to the minimum. The source reports note that TSMC's waste recycling rate is as high as 97%, and less than 1% of waste in Taiwan is landfilled. Moreover, a modern ‘Zero Waste Center' in Taichung has been successful at converting waste into electronic-grade raw materials – advancing the circular economy.

Brick by brick.

We all start somewhere in our PC building journey, but seldom does an opportunity present itself to make our first system as unique as u/OkDebate6649. That's exactly what happened with the aforementioned Reddit user who built his computer literally brick-by-brick using Lego. Known as ""Choi,"" our resident enthusiast took Lego-style bricks and made not only a full PC case, but also a monitor featuring an OLED panel, along with a mechanical keyboard — desktop terminal style.

One of the best parts is that this was Choi's first-ever custom PC, as he's only used pre-builts before this. You might think that he's some sort of Lego master builder, but he has no prior experience in that department either. In fact, the only reason he even got his hands on Lego in the first place was to hit the minimum requirement for a discount while shopping online. Once he got the bricks, though, he quickly figured this would make for a fun experiment and got to work.

Choi worked on the case, the monitor and the keyboard separately. Speaking to PC Gamer, he described how everything was constructed with modularity in mind. The monitor, which uses a 1080p OLED panel from AliExpress, is enclosed inside a custom body fully built from Lego. That frame can then attach to a similar keyboard housing and form a desktop terminal, akin to the Apple II. Not only that, but the case itself can be connected below the monitor.

Choi has posted his escapades across different subreddits; we embedded the most detailed post above where he showcases the build from the inside. As you can see, there's no dedicated GPU in there — the PC is powered by a Ryzen 5 5600G because Choi is sacrilegiously a PlayStation gamer and only needs this PC for office work. That 5600G is paired with equally-modest hardware like 16GB of memory, a basic ITX motherboard, and an AMD stock cooler. The build has two 120mm fans mounted externally for air intake.

Now, what if the transforming desktop terminal and the PC case were to get together and have a baby? Thankfully, our curious tinkerer has thought ahead and already made a ""retro Commodore-style monitor case."" Details on this project are scarce, but Choi has used a 4:3 monitor and put it inside a custom Lego housing that can also fit an entire PC in there. There's a USB hub up front, too, for quick access. Unlike the 5600G build, though, this one has space for a dedicated GPU, but Choi is only using it as a secondary monitor for now.

The DIY madness doesn't stop here, either. Clearly, Choi loved the Lego theme and ran with it even further, building projects like a desk clock powered by an iPhone 6, an audio deck made to look like an old radio, and also a Lego mouse that we spotted in the pictures, which Choi never mentioned in the text. Everything is neatly placed in the corner of a room, encapsulating the perfect Lego setup. Sure, there's no high-end hardware powering this stuff, but the ingenuity behind this is far beyond anything extra money alone could buy.

Choi had no prior experience with custom PCs or Lego, yet he somehow ended up combining the best of both worlds to create something truly unique. It's a testament to the creative child that lives within all of us, and how easily that spark can surface when we let go of preconceived notions about what's “too difficult."" What starts as a fun diversion can turn into something special very quickly. If you're interested in DIY creations like this, make sure to check out these Joycon-style Steam Deck controllers, or the time someone made their entire PC out of cardboard.

System Tray and Quick Settings access makes quick tests convenient.

Internet issues can quickly disrupt productivity and grind down your energy levels. Sometimes routing, packet loss, or DNS issues can get in the way even if your internet is technically still providing the right speeds. Of course, to test this out you can quickly head to websites like Ookla's Speedtest or Fast, but that might not be needed anymore. Microsoft is now working on implementing internet speed tests natively within Windows, according to prominent Windows insider phantomofearth.

The network icon in the system tray's context menu and the Wi-Fi quick settings page in Windows 11 are getting buttons to let you quickly run a network speed test. (Takes you to Bing to do the speed test.) pic.twitter.com/ZXcQvs5BP8September 13, 2025

With the upcoming change in place, at the corner of your Taskbar, in the system tray, right-clicking the network icon will show a new button for running a speed test. Similarly, when you click on said icon, the Wi-Fi quick settings page that pops up will have a speed test button in the corner. Clicking either will take you to Bing to perform the test, which excited users exactly as much as you think. The feature, therefore, isn't entirely native and might still rely on third-party services when it comes out.

Microsoft is also revamping the mobile devices page under Bluetooth settings. Any phones you've linked will now show up here, and you'll be able to control every aspect of those devices directly from this page, instead of a separate window like before. Not only that, but even the privacy and security settings pages are also being reworked to be easier to understand with more headings and descriptions, along with a new ""background AI tasks"" page that simply crashes at the moment.

The mobile devices settings page is being revamped! You will now be able to see connected devices and toggle all the options for them in this page, no separate manage mobile devices window needed. Related settings links are also being added. pic.twitter.com/WLfMmxOABOSeptember 13, 2025

These changes are part of the 26220.6682 and 26120.6682 (KB5065782) dev and beta builds, in the Insider channels. That means none of this stuff is guaranteed to go mainstream, and is subject to change, but we can still expect to see them soon since these are not controversial upgrades, rather small conveniences that add up to make the operating system feel more polished. Regardless of whenever we see this stuff, don't jump on the new version right away — it's best to stay cautious before you update.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:medicalnewstoday.com","What type of diet worsens IBD symptoms?","https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/what-type-of-diet-worsens-ibd-symptoms","Sun, 14 Sep 2025 05:51:18 GMT","

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects millions of people in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that between 2.4 and 3.1 million people live with a form of IBD. 

The exact cause of IBD is not yet known, but many scientists believe both genetics and the environment can factor into someone developing it. There is currently no cure, but treatments can help reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.

In addition to medical therapies, researchers are exploring how lifestyle factors, including diet, may impact the severity of IBD. 

A new study published in Nutrients examined the diets of 90 people with IBD to see whether their diets are linked to disease activity.

IBD is an autoimmune disorder that includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Both diseases are chronic and can cause flare-ups of symptoms.

Crohn's can affect any part of the digestive tract, especially the small intestine and colon. Inflammation can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, and weight loss.

Ulcerative colitis affects the large intestine (colon and rectum). It often causes ulcers, bleeding, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. 

To explore how diet influences IBD severity, the researchers studied 90 participants with IBD — 46 had Crohn's, and 44 had ulcerative colitis. 

Around 36% of the participants were in disease remission, 22% had mild disease, 31% had moderate disease, and 11% had severe disease.

Part of the study included determining the severity of the participants' IBD symptoms. For Crohn's, the researchers used the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), and for ulcerative colitis, they used the Partial Mayo Score. 

The participants underwent three dietary interviews where they provided information on what they had eaten over the past 24-hour period. They also completed food frequency questionnaires which cover broader eating habits.

This information was used to determine each person's Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), which gauges how strongly food intake promotes or reduces inflammation.

According to the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation, foods such as red meats and processed items can cause inflammation, whereas foods such as fruits and vegetables, or foods high in omega-3 fatty acids are more likely to reduce inflammation.

Additionally, the participants provided blood samples for the researchers to analyze for cytokine inflammation markers related to IBD. 

When the researchers compared DII scores across participants, they found no significant difference between people with Crohn's disease and those with ulcerative colitis overall. However, the scores did reveal a strong connection to disease severity.

Participants whose IBD was mild or in remission generally had lower (more anti-inflammatory) DII scores, suggesting their diets included more foods known to calm inflammation. 

By contrast, participants with moderate to severe symptoms had higher (more pro-inflammatory) scores.

This trend remained even after adjusting for factors such as age, smoking status, and treatment type. People with pro-inflammatory diets were about three times more likely to have worse IBD symptoms.

The scientists did not find any association between DII scores and blood cytokine levels. They say this may be due to the smaller size of the study.

Overall, the study emphasizes the importance an anti-inflammatory diet may have on IBD. While further studies are needed, the findings are encouraging for people trying to manage their IBD symptoms through diet choices. 

Raj Dasgupta, MD, Chief Medical Advisor for Sleepopolis, and associate professor of clinical medicine at the University of California, spoke with Medical News Today about the study.

“This study reinforces what we've been seeing for a while,” said Dasgupta, who was not involved in this research. “It's another piece of evidence that diet isn't just background [and] can play a real role in how the disease shows up.”

He noted that pro-inflammatory foods may contribute directly to IBD flare-ups. “These foods can disrupt the gut microbiome, weaken the intestinal barrier, and drive inflammation in the body,” mentioned Dasgupta. “For someone with IBD, that extra inflammation can make flare-ups more likely or more intense.”

Speaking about what people can do to reduce risk, Dasgupta recommended focusing on anti-inflammatory eating patterns. He advised that:

“I usually recommend a Mediterranean-style approach. More fruits, vegetables, lean proteins like fish, whole grains if tolerated, and fewer processed and sugary foods.”

Interventions to address firearm accessibility and related dangers should account not only for direct exposure to violence but also for complex psychosocial pathways through which firearms affect mental health across populations, according to a systematic scoping review published in the September/October issue of Harvard Review of Psychiatry, part of the Lippincott portfolio from Wolters Kluwer.

Rodolfo Furlan Damiano, MD, PhD, of the Institute of Psychiatry at the University of São Paulo in Brazil, and colleagues are the first to comprehensively examine data on the mental health effects of firearm ownership, violence, and policies. They conclude, ""A whole-government approach that prioritizes mental health screenings, firearm safety, evidence-based policies, and socioeconomic equity could significantly reduce the prevalence of firearm-related psychological harm.""

The researchers conducted a systematic literature search of multiple databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycInfo, from inception to March 1, 2023. Any study related to firearms that had mental health outcomes was eligible for consideration. There were no language or geographic limitations.

In a scoping review, the researchers then explored relationships among firearm access, aggressive behavior, substance abuse, and societal violence, and their influences on mental health. The hierarchical screening protocol prioritized studies with direct mental health outcomes and included those with established mental health implications from adjacent fields (criminology, public health, sociology). Ultimately, data were extracted from 467 studies.

The vast majority of studies (81%) were conducted in the US, 6% in Western Europe, 4% in Australia, and 3% in Canada, with a few other countries contributing one or two studies. Suicide was by far the most studied outcome (61% of studies), followed by firearm access, firearm violence (7.3%), and depression/fear (each 2.4%). The analysis demonstrated considerable research gaps on mental health consequences, such as posttraumatic stress disorder, sleep disturbances, intimate partner violence, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders.

The scoping review revealed three fundamental psychological mechanisms through which firearms affect mental health:

""These interconnected mechanisms account for some of why firearms-which are deeply ingrained in society and perceived as symbols of power and freedom-have such significant consequences for mental health outcomes,"" the authors explain.

Cultural reliance on firearms extends beyond physical danger, they emphasize. The complex psychosocial pathways that heighten risk of impulsive action simultaneously generate population-level psychological effects, which explain why multilevel interventions are necessary.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Early B cell response prevents Oropouche virus from reaching the brain","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250914/Early-B-cell-response-prevents-Oropouche-virus-from-reaching-the-brain.aspx","Sun, 14 Sep 2025 16:03:00 GMT","

Research conducted on mice has identified that the rapid response of a specific type of defense cell is essential for controlling Oropouche virus infections and preventing serious neurological damage. Without treatment, ""Oropouche fever"" causes symptoms including headaches, muscle and joint pain, skin rashes, and vomiting. In severe cases, it can lead to meningitis and encephalitis. Pregnant women are at risk of complications, including miscarriage.

These findings will contribute to future studies on developing therapies and vaccines against the disease. The Oropouche virus is considered a neglected arbovirus that is transmitted by the midge Culicoides paraensis when it is infected with Orthobunyavirus oropoucheense (OROV). Between January and early June of this year, Brazil recorded a more than 60% increase in cases compared to the same period in 2024 – approximately 11,500 confirmed cases (compared to 7,200 last year) and four deaths. This total in just under six months is close to the number of cases recorded during the whole of last year – 13,800 according to the Brazilian Ministry of Health. 

The scientists discovered that B cells in the marginal zone of the spleen are the first lymphocytes to act in the body after infection, rapidly producing antibodies that prevent the virus from spreading and reaching the central nervous system and brain. This early production of antibodies depends on a protein, MyD88, which activates the response, helping to neutralize Oropouche.

The results of the study are published in the journal eBioMedicine, from the Lancet group (United Kingdom).

This study yielded a very important result, advancing our understanding of how this virus acts in two ways. First, from a mechanistic perspective, by analyzing the marginal zone B lymphocyte pathway, which has been little explored in relation to arthropod-borne viral infections. This helps us understand the mechanisms associated with encephalitis and those that protect the body from viral access to the central nervous system. The second point is related to the possibility of therapy and vaccines, showing that antibodies act quickly. This suggests that the therapeutic window may not be so long, requiring rapid action in the early stages of infection.""

José Luiz Proença Modena, one of the study's advisors and professor at the Institute of Biology at the State University of Campinas (IB-UNICAMP), Brazil

Modena is the coordinator of the Laboratory of Emerging Viruses (LEVE) at UNICAMP. LEVE is supported by FAPESP, which also funded the research through three other projects (16/00194-8, 17/11931-6, and 14/50938-8).

The lead author of the article, researcher Daniel Teixeira, points out that the threat of outbreaks and epidemics makes understanding the mechanisms of Oropouche infection even more urgent. ""We've managed to shed light on a virus that's still little known to the general public. By studying it, it's possible to predict processes that may be triggered in the body, and as a result, science can prepare to face epidemics.""

Earlier this year, another study published in the journal Infectious Diseases – also involving scientists from LEVE – showed that Oropouche fever, documented in South America since the 1950s, experienced an explosion of cases between November 2023 and June 2024 in four countries: Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.

In Brazil, autochthonous infections were recorded in areas that were previously non-endemic in all five of the country's regions, with cases in 21 states. The incidence rate increased almost 200-fold compared to the last ten years. ""The symptoms of the disease are similar to dengue and Zika and can be confused. Therefore, tests for Oropouche are also necessary for epidemiological monitoring,"" Modena adds.

Following the increase in cases, the Ministry of Health updated the rules for surveillance and control of the Oropouche virus in Brazil, which is now subject to mandatory reporting – that is, all suspected or confirmed cases must be reported within 24 hours.

The work was carried out by a group of 30 researchers from various institutions. In addition to UNICAMP, the group included scientists from the University of São Paulo (USP), the Federal University of Roraima, and FIOCRUZ Amazônia (also in Brazil), Cardiff University (United Kingdom), the University of Kentucky, and Washington University in St. Louis (United States).

""We benefited from the efforts of foreign researchers, but most of the work – the actual hands-on work – was done in Brazil by graduate students. This shows the importance of investing in science and in training new scientists,"" Teixeira points out.

The group conducted immunophenotyping experiments, passive serum transfers, and adoptive cell transfers to determine how early antibody and B cell responses control viral replication and spread to the central nervous system after infection. The mice produced specific antibodies against OROV within six days of infection.

After significant investment and preparation, the Trauma Center at NYU Langone Hospital—Suffolk has been verified as a Level 2 Adult Trauma Center by the American College of Surgeons (ACS), meaning the hospital is equipped to care for all adult trauma patients, regardless of severity. This milestone represents a major expansion of acute care services, designed to meet the growing needs of both the hospital and the communities it serves throughout Suffolk County.

This milestone recognizes the dedication of our staff and affirms our enhanced capabilities to deliver the full spectrum of adult trauma care to our patients. Community members and our local EMS partners can feel confident knowing the highest-quality emergency care is available nearby when it's needed most.""

Marc S. Adler, MD, senior vice president and chief of hospital operations at NYU Langone Hospital—Suffolk

ACS-verified Level 2 Trauma Centers must meet the essential criteria that ensure trauma care capability and the highest level of institutional performance, including the following:

The journey to becoming a Level 2 Adult Trauma Center began in April 2024, when the hospital submitted its application to elevate its trauma center verification from Level 3 with the ACS and the New York State (NYS) Department of Health (DOH). In October 2024, the hospital was designated by the NYS DOH as a Provisional Level 2 Adult Trauma Center, while awaiting verification by the ACS. In July 2025, the ACS conducted a comprehensive review of the hospital's capabilities and performance. After the review, the ACS verified the hospital's Level 2 status and commended the hospital for its multidisciplinary approach, its robust injury prevention and outreach programs, and its ability to deliver comprehensive trauma care to patients.

Complex biological systems are more than the sum of their parts – their properties emerge from the dynamic interaction of their components, such as molecules or cells. PhD researchers now have the opportunity to develop their own theoretical perspective on these systems as part of an international Doctoral Network. A European consortium initiated by researchers from the University of Göttingen, the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization (MPI-DS), and the University of Edinburgh has been awarded €4.5M by Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions to coordinate the network. The network consists of twelve European universities and research centres along with a number of partners outside academia. It is coordinated by the University of Edinburgh.

The new network – ""Coherent Analysis Framework for Emergence in Biological Systems"" or ""CAFE-BIO"" for short – will recruit and train fifteen PhD researchers, each gaining a distinct theoretical perspective on complex biological systems. A significant feature of the programme is that each PhD researcher will collaborate with scientists from two different academic institutions, combining previously separate techniques in innovative ways. Each institution will take a lead on different research questions inspired by biological systems. For example, one group, led by Barcelona, will develop new models to describe the full complexity of living matter, incorporating interactions that are absent in traditional condensed matter systems. A second group, led by Leiden, will develop reliable methods to determine how such interactions play out at a macroscopic level, meaning observable by the naked eye, and govern an organism's function. Thirdly, a group led by Warsaw will apply state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to aid the design of predictive models of complex biological systems.

The combined effects of these endeavours will create a framework, firmly grounded in the principles of physics, that can be applied systematically to understand the many and varied forms of biological complexity. PhD researchers will benefit from training provided by several partners outside academia, including IndiScale, a spin-out company from MPI-DS in Göttingen that focuses on research data management. Recruitment for the fifteen positions will open in February 2026 with research commencing in autumn 2026.

Göttingen and Edinburgh are the two major hubs in the new network, with five principal investigators across the Göttingen campus: Professors Stefan Klumpp and Peter Sollich (Göttingen University), together with Dr Philip Bittihn, Professor Ramin Golestanian and Dr David Zwicker (MPI-DS). The Doctoral Network is supported by the EU's flagship funding programme Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions. The initial collaboration was made possible thanks to seed funding from the Ministry for Science and Culture of Lower Saxony and the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

Physical sports have long been known to help with anxiety and mental health. But can augmented and virtual reality sports games improve psychological well-being and reduce loneliness? Researchers at Michigan State University's Department of Kinesiology say yes.

Assistant professors Sanghoon Kim and Sangchul Park, at MSU's College of Education, led a study to explore layered questions on the psychological benefits of using augmented/virtual reality, or AR/VR, technology.

Published in the International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, the study shows that playing AR/VR sports games can promote psychological well-being by helping players feel connected to others and engage in real-time communication. More interestingly, the positive effects of feeling socially present were even stronger for those experiencing loneliness.

These findings remind us that psychological well-being is multifaceted. Even in gaming, it's shaped not only by what people experience in virtual environments, but also by how those experiences connect with their real-life relationships and social ties.""

Sanghoon Kim and Sangchul Park, lead authors on the study

The study analyzed results from a survey of 345 individuals who played various AR/VR sports games, such as table tennis, bowling or billiards. These games can be found on platforms like Wii Sports (Nintendo), Home Sports (Meta) and others.

The recruited participants voluntarily completed a questionnaire to assess their game involvement, psychological well-being, loneliness and other factors.""The importance of these findings is to show that well-being is a complex and multidimensional construct that can be more fully understood when both individuals' sources of enjoyment - for example, games - and their social experiences - for example, loneliness - are considered simultaneously,"" Kim and Park said.

Researchers found that those who were more engaged in gaming showed higher levels of psychological well-being. This finding provides valuable insights into the ongoing debate on the advantages and disadvantages of gaming involvement, adding new perspectives from AR/VR gaming.They also found that AR/VR sports games can create a strong sense of being with others by using avatars, real-time communication and nonverbal cues. Importantly, these social connections not only create a shared presence but also play a key role in improving players' psychological well-being.""When people feel present with others through avatars or virtual interaction, the experience becomes more than just a game,"" said Kim. ""That's the power of social presence.""The findings also expand traditional ideas about online interaction, showing that AR/VR gaming goes beyond text to include richer, more human-like ways of connecting.Users who gamed more often and who experienced loneliness in their daily lives were more likely to experience a positive psychological benefit. The authors speculated that AR/VR sports games might be offered into therapeutic interventions for those experiencing loneliness or mental health challenges.

Still, the researchers say AR/VR sports games are not a catch-all solution for resolving loneliness. Some users, they found, may still feel uneasy about communicating and interacting in virtual settings, making it harder for them to develop a sense of belonging through gaming.It's one of the reasons the researchers encourage practitioners and policymakers to also consider regulating how AR/VR sports games are used to support mental health and engagement.""The study revealed not all individuals benefit from social AR/VR sport gaming,"" according to the study, which was co-authored with Jun-Phil Uhm at Inha University and Sungsook Ahn at Cheongju University. ""This highlights the importance of educating users, practitioners and policymakers on how to harness its potential while being mindful of its possible drawbacks.""

This finding provides valuable insights into the ongoing debate on the advantages and disadvantages of gaming involvement, adding new perspectives from AR/VR gaming.

The International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR), the largest professional organization of stem cell researchers from around the world, is concerned about a recent statement attributed to NIH that the agency will not renew research grants involving human fetal tissue (HFT), and that research with HFT is not conducted responsibly or transparently. In fact, research with HFT has been indispensable in advancing biomedicine and saving millions of lives, and it continues to play an essential role in accelerating research that benefits patients.

ISSCR President Hideyuki Okano released the following statement:

""Research with HFT and HFT-derived cell lines has been a cornerstone of biomedical progress since the 1930s. For decades, this work has been conducted with bipartisan congressional support under both Republican and Democratic administrations in the U.S. HFT is an invaluable tool for advancing our understanding of human development, infertility, and diseases like diabetes, Zika virus, HIV, and neurodegenerative disorders. Cell lines originally derived from HFT have contributed to the development of vaccines for polio, rubella, measles, chickenpox, shingles, rabies, and COVID-19. Despite significant progress in the development of organoids and animal models, HFT continues to provide unique biological insights that cannot yet be fully replicated by alternative research methods.

This critical work is governed by a robust ethical and legal framework that ensures responsible research conduct and public accountability. There is a longstanding oversight process for research using HFT that ensures it is scientifically meritorious, legal, and ethically sound. This framework requires thorough informed consent for tissue donation and prohibits individuals from profiting from acquiring, receiving, or transferring fetal tissue for research. These safeguards protect the rights of donors, uphold public trust, and ensure that research using HFT proceeds responsibly while continuing to deliver vital scientific advances.

We urge NIH to reject political pressure to discontinue research with HFT and instead reaffirm its role as a champion of evidence-based biomedical science.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Smoking raises the risk of all subtypes of type 2 diabetes","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250913/Smoking-raises-the-risk-of-all-subtypes-of-type-2-diabetes.aspx","Sun, 14 Sep 2025 03:05:00 GMT","

The characteristics of type 2 diabetes vary from patient to patient and it has been proposed that the condition is made up of four subtypes. Now, new research being presented at the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in Vienna, Austria (15-19 September) shows that smoking increases the risk of the condition, regardless of subtype.

The researchers in Sweden, Norway and Finland also found that people with a genetic susceptibility to develop diabetes seem more vulnerable to the adverse effects of smoking.

It has previously been suggested that type 2 diabetes (T2D) can be divided into the following subtypes: SIRD (severe insulin-resistant diabetes), characterised by insulin resistance (where the body's cells don't respond to properly to insulin and can't easily take up glucose from the blood); SIDD (severe insulin-deficient diabetes), characterised by a lack of insulin; MOD (mild obesity-related diabetes), associated with obesity and younger age of onset; and MARD (mild age-related diabetes) which develops later in life.

Severity, prognosis and risk of complications differ across the subtypes but it is not clear if they have different risk factors.

To find out more, Emmy Keysendal, a PhD student at Karolinska Institutet, in Stockholm, Sweden, and colleagues examined the link between smoking, which is already known to be a potent risk factor for T2D in general, and other forms of tobacco use, and the various subtypes of T2D.

The researchers used data on 3,325 individuals with T2D (495 SIDD, 477 SIRD, 693 MOD and 1660 MARD) and 3,897 controls from a long-running diabetes study in Norway (average follow-up time of 17 years) and a case-control study in Sweden.

They found that ever smokers (current and past smokers) were at higher risk of all four sub-types of T2D than those who had never smoked. The link between smoking and SIRD was particularly strong. 

Ever smokers were more than twice as likely (2.15 times) as never smokers to develop SIRD. This compares with increases in risk of 20% for SIDD, 29% for MOD and 27% for MARD.

Smoking was estimated to be responsible for more than a third of SIRD cases, but less than 15% of the other diabetes subtypes (SIDD, MOD and MARD).

Smoking heavily (≥15 pack-years/20 cigarettes a day for 15 years or equivalent) further increased the risk of all four subtypes. Heavy smokers were 2.35 times more likely to develop SIRD than never smokers and 52%, 57% and 45% more likely develop SIDD, MOD and MARD, respectively.

Interestingly, the data on men in Sweden suggested that heavy use of snus, a smokeless tobacco product popular in Scandinavian countries, was linked to increased risk of the severe subtypes SIDD (19% higher risk) and SIRD (13% higher risk) compared to never users of snus.

The study also explored whether smoking further increased the risk in individuals with a genetic predisposition to T2D, insulin resistance or reduced insulin secretion.

This showed that heavy smokers with genetic predisposition to T2D or reduced insulin secretion were particularly vulnerable.

For example, those who smoked heavily and had a high genetic risk for impaired insulin secretion had more than three times the risk (3.52-fold) of developing SIRD compared to those without these risk factors.

The researchers concluded that smoking increases the risk of T2D, whatever the subtype.

It is clear that smoking increases the risk of type 2 diabetes whatever the subtype, that is, regardless, of whether the diabetes is characterised by insulin resistance, lack of insulin, obesity or old age.

The strongest association was seen for the subtype characterised by severe insulin resistance (SIRD), which suggests that smoking may contribute to diabetes by impairing the body's ability to respond to insulin.

Our findings emphasize the importance of smoking cessation in the prevention of type 2 diabetes. They also indicate that genetic information may help identify individuals most likely to benefit from extra support in stopping smoking.""

The story of the princess and the pea evokes an image of a highly sensitive royal young woman so refined, she can sense a pea under a stack of mattresses. When it comes to human biology, it also takes an abnormal individual to sense far beyond its surroundings, in this case, a cancer cell. Now, researchers also know that normal cells can pull a similar trick by working together.

Research published in the journal PNAS from engineers at Washington University in St. Louis offers a clearer picture of how cells can sense beyond their direct environment. The research can help further the understanding of how cancer moves and point to potential targets to stop that migration.

Amit Pathak, a professor of mechanical engineering and materials science at the McKelvey School of Engineering, explained that ""depth mechano-sensing"" is how cells sense beyond what they are attached to. In previous research, he and colleagues discovered that abnormal cells with a ""high front-rear polarity"" (indicative of migrating cells) can sense the farthest depth, up to 10 microns beyond their adhered environment.

Part of that sensory ability has to do with how the cell deforms the surrounding fibrous collagen to reach out into extracellular matrix (ECM) and ""feel"" the next layer, whether that's a hard tumor, soft tissue or bone just around the bend. The single abnormal cell can ""feel"" the stiffness of the ECM and set its course based on that input.

The new research shows that a collective of epithelial cells, found on the surface of tissue, can do the same and then some, working together to muster enough force to ""feel"" through the fibrous collagen the layer as far as 100 microns away.

""Because it's a collective of cells, they are generating higher forces,"" said Pathak, who authored the research along with PhD student Hongsheng Yu.

According to their models, this occurs in two distinct phases of cell clustering and migration. What those clustering cells ""feel"" will impact migration and dispersal.

The extra sensing power of cancer cells means that they can get out of the tumor environment and evade detection, migrating freely thanks to their enhanced sense of what's ahead, even in a soft environment. Researchers' next step will be understanding how that works, and if certain regulators allow for the range. Those regulators could be potential targets for cancer therapy. If a cancer cell can't ""feel"" its way forward, its toxic spread may be put in check.

Get unrivaled matchday access

“We want to compete for trophies,” said Nashville SC's head coach B.J. Callaghan on the eve of the 2025 Semifinal. “And that's what this U.S. Open Cup is giving us the opportunity to do.”

Every coach, in his position, would say something similar. A trophy is proof of concept, physical evidence of success for a player, every member of a team's staff and the fans in the stands. It sits proudly, a symbol behind glass, to tell a shiny story of good days for as long as anyone cares about such things.

But you get the sense, talking to the 44-year-old boss born and raised on the Jersey Shore, that it's about more than professional status to him. More than a bullet point on a resume. There's something very human behind Callaghan's desire to lift a trophy into the air in early October. It's about the group, about stewardship and those eternal things sport has a way of unlocking.

“These are the games you remember, Championship games and Semifinals, that you, coaches and players and fans, will be talking about years later,” he insisted. “You don't talk that way about Game 14 of the regular season. These are the moments that matter.”

Callaghan understands the magic of the moment on a cellular level. In his first year in his first head coaching job in MLS, he's best known – rightly and fondly – for his brief time in charge of the U.S. Men's National Team in May and June of 2023. With controversy swirling around previous coach Gregg Berhalter, and doubts about how to move the program forward, Callaghan stepped up from assistant to interim head coach for 61 days, with a Concacaf Nations League right smack in the middle.

The team, given the circumstances, had every excuse to fall flat. Instead, the Stars and Stripes rose to the occasion with an iconic win over Mexico in the semis and an epic trophy lift after a 2-0 win over Canada. Callaghan, who finished his tenure in charge of the USMNT without losing a single game, with four wins and three draws from seven, was right there at the heart of it all.

“When it's going good, it's easy,” said Callaghan, quick to deflect credit for the Nations League success, claiming “there were a lot of things in place” when he was dropped into the hot seat. “When it's a little difficult, when you get hit with a little bit of adversity, that's when you find out what you're about as a group. What makes me happiest when I think back on it is, when we were called on, in a really difficult time, we responded together and exceeded expectations.”Callaghan, who speaks often and earnestly about his desire to help bring people together, became a cult hero of American soccer in that summer of 2023. The Nashville coach, he of boyish smile and broad shoulders, laughs off such assertions – but it's still true. The original team-guy, you'll not find anyone with a bad word to say about him from his five years with the National Team staff or his six years before that with the Philadelphia Union, where he began his pro coaching career analyzing video.“B.J. is an amazing guy and I have a lot of respect for him – and he had a lot to say about the way we did things on the field,” said Alejandro Bedoya, who, in the late autumn of his playing career and still with Philly, will go head-to-head with Callaghan in the 2025 Open Cup Semifinal on September 16 at 8pm ET at Nashville's Geodis Park (LIVE on Paramount+ and on air at CBS Sports Network).

It hasn't been all glory-days and trophy hoists for Callaghan. After starting out in the college game with his alma mater Ursinus College, where he was a standout DIII goalkeeper, and Villanova's men's and women's programs, he spent six years with the Union as an assistant. There, he was part of a club that reached three Open Cup Finals.

“I was there for all three of those Finals and we lost them all,” he said, of those days working under long-time coach Jim Curtin, who won two Open Cups as a player with the Chicago Fire and “made sure everyone understood the history and meaning” of the tournament. “It was a first taste of how winning trophies is so rare, so difficult, and how, when you have an opportunity, you have to go all-in.”

He still has vivid memories of those three Finals, when it was “right there at your fingertips.” From 2014: Hitting a post late and losing to Seattle in front of a full house at home. From 2015: Again at home, devastated by Sporting Kansas City in a shootout, Curtin swapping out goalkeepers for the post-game penalties, “because you have to expect the unexpected in those games.” Most recently, from 2018: Traveling to Houston “with the whole club staff, all as one” and losing to the Dynamo.Callaghan draws the nectar of positivity from getting to those Finals. “I think the Open Cup, with all its tradition and energy, just brings something special,” he said. “It can galvanize the fan base, bring a whole squad and a whole club together from top to bottom.”

The coach is looking for more of that, and a bit more still, this year.In a twist, it's that very Philadelphia Union that stands between Callaghan and another U.S. Open Cup Final. “Semifinals are always the hardest games to get through,” said the Nashville SC boss, only the second head coach since the club's founding in 2018. “They take a lot of focus and preparation – the regular season disappears when you step into them.”

“The difficulty is only compounded by the fact that we're playing Philadelphia,” he said of the upcoming meeting with this old club, and, as it just so happens, the best team in Major League Soccer under new boss Bradley Carnell. “They're a really good team, a really deep team and one that shares our ambitions of wanting to lift the Open Cup.”With a squad that tries to “out-team” other teams, the 2025 Nashville SC squad is built in its coach's image. There's the talent of former MLS MVP Hany Mukhtar, the goals of league top-scorer Sam Surridge, the elegant wide play of Andy Najar, of course – but there's also the battle and the togetherness that runs like an artery through the entire squad. “We like to work for a purpose that's bigger than ourselves as individuals,” Callaghan insisted. “That's how you achieve things.”

“It's gonna' be a heavyweight battle,” Callaghan added. “I'm sure we can't even dream of some of the things that are going to happen in this one.”

He has a soft spot for the unpredictability peculiar to the Open Cup. The do-or-die energy, whether it's in the early rounds against an amateur team or on the verge of a Final, is something he welcomes. “It's win or go home – it's a unique juice and a special kind of energy. You want trophies, you want to compete, no one wants to lose – and everything is on the line no matter who you're playing.”

On the other side of the final whistle lurks the chance to play for a first title in club history – to lift a trophy up into the air and set the flashbulbs bursting. Don't think for a minute that the meaning of that is lost on a man like Callaghan.

“We're two games from a trophy,” he said, a stern look in his eye. “You have to be brave because this is something that can bring everyone together, the whole city. It's the story you tell your buddy at the bar 20 years from now, the one you share with those who helped.

“Maybe you're the ten year old kid who falls in love with Nashville Soccer Club that night,” added Callaghan, alive, always, to the joyful possibilities.Fontela is editor-in-chief ofusopencup.com.

                All about the over/under odds for the blockbuster Manchester Derby.            

Fans will be on the edge of their seats on Super Sunday, as Pep Guardiola's Manchester City take on Ruben Amorim's Manchester United in a massive Premier League encounter. The 197th Manchester derby has the potential to set a precedent for what is to come this season – as two struggling sides compete for regional supremacy. Can the Etihad Stadium push their men in blue over the line?

Manchester City are currently languishing in the bottom half of the table. Having won their first four games across the past two seasons, this is unfamiliar territory for Guardiola and Co. The fact that United have inflicted 4 out of 16 home defeats on the Catalan manager in the Premier League, won't boost their confidence whatsoever. For Amorim, the pressure continues to mount – especially considering his flailing record in terms of consistency in the league.

Who will pick up the important three points over the weekend? Let's look at the best odds – via BetMGM:

Pick: Over 2.5 Goals at -175

Considering the attacking threat of both setups, there is a likelihood of a goal fest on Sunday. With big names such as Erling Haaland, Bruno Fernandes and Bernardo Silva set to feature, one can expect some goals and thrills. Moreover, the defensive weaknesses of City and United are glaring in nature. While the 2023-24 champions are struggling with their defensive shape, the Reds will be desperate to put an end to their goalkeeper conundrum.

What did you expect @ErlingHaaland? 🤣☔️ pic.twitter.com/BgL0RKqZEF

Pick: Over 24.5 Shots at -143

Pick: Over 9.5 Shots on Target at -110 (via BetMGM)

City have a knack of cutting through defences in the final third, and Guardiola could insist on testing the shot-stopper of the Reds with more shots. With the likes of Fernandes and Mainoo providing options from midfield for the away side, there will be a threat on the counter-attack. Once the game starts to become end-to-end, the quick transitions and half chances make the odds of >24.5 and >9.5 seem very accurate.

Pick: Under 10.5 Corners at -137

While the past derby duels have yielded a plethora of corners, the count is not expected to go well into the double digits. The head-to-head statistics show that many of the shots taken are stopped, rather than parried away. City likes to engage in patient build-up play and carefully crafted transitions, making their corner count relatively low. On the contrary, United's intent and ability to cause chaos/disruption in their attacking third will determine how the match unfolds.

International break: over. Club football and a Manchester derby to look forward to this weekend ⏳ pic.twitter.com/XFAxAh9APP

Pick: Over 3.5 Cards at -150

In a high stakes, high reward match-up like this, tensions and tempers are bound to flare up. In their most recent 0-0 draw during the 2024-25 campaign, a total of 5 yellow cards were handed out. The fact that both teams have players who tend to be on the rash side when it comes to challenges, makes this >3.5 at -150 a spot-on prediction.

World Cup

This is the tenth in a series by The Athletic looking back at the winners of each men's World Cup. 

Previously, we've looked at Uruguay in 1930, Italy in 1934 and again in 1938, Uruguay in 1950, West Germany in 1954, before a Brazilian double in 1958 and 1962, an England success in 1966, and another Brazil win in 1970. This time, we're off to West Germany.

In a tournament compromised by wet weather and therefore boggy pitches, hosts West Germany were not overwhelmingly popular winners. Their 1972 European Championship-winning side had played open, expansive football, but that approach gave way to a more cautious, less spectacular approach here.

A key difference was the decline of star midfielder Gunter Netzer, who had controversially left Borussia Monchengladbach for Real Madrid a year earlier, but endured a disastrous first season in La Liga, failing to score a single goal. “They have the players and they will have the crowd support, but they also have the enigma of Netzer, their brilliant midfielder,” reed The New York Times' Alex Yannis in his tournament preview. “If Netzer plays as well as in 1972, the West German team, with players like Wolfgang Overath, Gerd Muller and Franz Beckenbauer will undoubtedly go far.”

That's the extent to which Netzer was considered the key man beforehand, but his poor form eventually cost him a place in the West German starting XI, and the side compensated for his absence through discipline and energy rather than flair.

The victorious West Germany squad nearly didn't play in the World Cup at all. On the eve of the tournament, a row broke out over bonuses. The same was true of the Dutch squad, and such situations have become something of a World Cup cliche, but in 1974 this was considered novel, and a sign that the sport had become overrun by financial interests, even at international level.

Negotiations between the squad and the federation became so tense that Helmut Schon threatened to quit, and to drop the entire squad and play the reserves instead. Captain Beckenbauer eventually saved the day, convincing the players to accept a slightly lower offer from the federation than the one they had been holding out for. Still, this contributed to a somewhat tepid level of support for the hosts, even on home soil, especially when combined with flat, uninspiring football in the group stage.

First, they unconvincingly beat outsiders Chile and Australia 1-0 and 3-0 respectively. Then, as with West Germany's previous World Cup triumph, there was a symbolic defeat.

Whereas in 1954 it had been against Hungary, who West Germany eventually defeated in the final, here it was in a politically charged game against East Germany — the only full international between the sides — played amongst a huge security presence.

As a striker, Schon scored 17 goals in 16 caps for Germany between 1937 and 1941, and as manager had taken West Germany to second and third place at the World Cup in 1966 and 1970 respectively, as well as to Euro 1972 success.

But that doesn't explain the real story, which is that Schon was from Dresden, in East Germany, and fled to West Germany in 1950 because of political interference in East German football. He coached the Saarland ‘national' side during its period of French occupation, when the players were prevented from representing West Germany. During that period, his Saarland side lost in the 1954 World Cup qualifiers to his future side, West Germany.

“I wanted to be everything apart from a football manager,” he once said. “I realised early how difficult and often unrewarding the job could be, and how it depends upon so many factors and circumstances over which even the best manager has little or no control.”

His lowest point came midway through this tournament, and that chastening defeat to East Germany — a game Schon desperately wanted to win, for understandable reasons. Afterwards he locked himself away, was unable to conduct a press conference the following day, and was described as being on the verge of a breakdown.

But the defeat forced Schon to adjust his side, and — perhaps like Spain's defeat by Switzerland in 2010 or Argentina's against Saudi Arabia in 2022 — was eventually considered a blessing in disguise, particularly as it put West Germany on the weaker half of the draw, in a tournament that featured a second group stage rather than quarter-finals and semi-finals. West Germany therefore had to finish above Sweden, Poland and Yugoslavia to reach the final, rather than Brazil, Argentina and the Netherlands.

Beckenbauer is considered the best and most influential defender in football history — with the only reasonable argument against that status being that he wasn't really a defender at all. Originally renowned as an intelligent midfielder capable of driving forward into attack, Beckenbauer pioneered the role of the attacking sweeper, and future German midfield stars often copied him and dropped into that role.

Previously, playing as the ‘spare man' in defence had been regarded as a purely defensive role, but Beckenbauer considered that, by being the extra player, he would have freedom in possession too — and license to bring the ball forward from the back. Four years beforehand, Brazil's Gerson was considered unconventional as a playmaker operating unusually far back, in front of the defence. But Beckenbauer was positioned even deeper than him. Spoken about as an exception to the system-first football dominating Europe during this period, Beckenbauer was considered a flair player who had freedom to do as he pleased, although he was sometimes criticised for his languid nature.

Away from the pitch, Beckenbauer was also an old-school captain — and by ‘old-school', this means a relic from the days when the captain was responsible for selection and tactics, before the football manager had become all-powerful.

After West Germany's poor group stage performance, he convinced Schon to bring in fresh blood in the form of winger Bernd Holzenbein, who won the penalty for the equaliser in the final, and energetic midfielder Rainer Bonhof, who assisted the winner. He also started appearing alongside Schon at press conferences, taking the lead when it came to tactical questions.

It was little surprise he later became the side's manager, and in 1990 he followed Mario Zagallo by becoming the second man to win the World Cup as both a player and a manager.

Beckenbauer's role, starting as West Germany's spare defender and then dribbling forward into attack to create chances for teammates, was the key feature of this side. But it was also one small part of the overall approach, and at the time this side was spoken about in a similar sense to the Netherlands, just as European Champions Bayern Munich were considered comparable to Ajax.

“It became clear just how close German football had become to Dutch football,” wrote Tobias Escher in his history of German football tactics, Vom Libero Zur Doppelsechs (From Libero To Double Pivot), of the 1972 side. “Schon's philosophy, the dominant game, the possession of the ball, was the same as Rinus Michels'.”

While the 1974 side was not as entertaining, and was considered ageing need of younger legs — particularly at the start of the tournament — this was still a very fluid side. As well as Beckenbauer pushing forward, right-footed left-back Paul Breitner was also a multifaceted footballer who attacked like a Brazilian but defended like, well, a German.

West Germany's precise XI changed throughout the tournament, particularly after the defeat by East Germany. In the final, Berti Vogts — who usually played to the right of defence — was given the task of watching Johan Cruyff, which meant a withdrawn role for winger Jurgen Grabowski, best known for influencing the game from the bench, particularly in Mexico four years beforehand in the first World Cup featuring substitutes. Vogts, incidentally, still had license to dribble forward, play a one-two and find himself through on goal in the first half. Total football.

West Germany's players embraced that billing — to a certain extent. “I know that the expression has been used almost incessantly since about 1972, often by people who don't really know what it means,” said Grabowski. “Basically, ‘total football' is no magic formula, it simply means that every player should be allowed to attack and defend. In my view this concept will dominate the football scene for years to come.”

Their passing network from the final shows Beckenbauer and Uli Hoeness — who played ahead of Overath and Bonhof in a midfield trio — as the key passers. Muller seems disconnected from everyone else here, but then that was what Muller was all about.



The first time a West Germany player touched the ball in Munich was when goalkeeper Sepp Maier picked it out of his own net. The Netherlands had kicked off, built a patient passing move which accelerated suddenly when Cruyff — as if to show what Total Football was all about — collected the ball as the Netherlands' deepest player, a la Beckenabauer — then dribbled forward into the box, was tripped, before Johan Neeskens blasted the resulting penalty straight down the middle.

But what was cast as a battle between Cruyff and Beckenbauer didn't play out that way. Neither had an outstanding game, with Cruyff largely kept quiet by Vogts. At the time, the Dutch were criticised for holding onto possession and slowing the game at 1-0, rather than going for more goals, although through a modern lens this seems a standard tactic.

Similarly, the penalty for West Germany's equaliser was considered soft — Holzenbein was renowned for going to ground easily — but Wim Jansen dived in, and got nowhere near the ball, and it would be considered a stonewall penalty in 2025.

Breitner unfussily converted the game's second penalty. 1-1, and and it was game on. “Perhaps the Dutch thought we would be easy after they scored that goal in the first minute,” Schon said afterwards. “But a match lasts 90 minutes and the better fighters won it.”

Considering it was the winning goal in a memorable final, Muller's crucial strike shortly before half-time — a good shot on the turn, one of his specialisms — doesn't feel particularly famous compared to mere ‘clinching' goals scored in the 1966 and 1970 finals, for example.

But Muller was a fitting matchwinner; he was the outstanding finisher of his generation. This goal took him clear of Just Fontaine and onto 14 World Cup goals, scored across 1970 and 1974, the most until he was overtaken by Ronaldo of Brazil (15) in 2006 and fellow German Miroslav Klose (16) in 2014. It must also be said that, for all the lamenting of the Netherlands' failure to win, West Germany — and Muller — were robbed of a clear goal in the second half due to an erroneous offside flag.

Muller's goal that did count, incidentally, was featured on the front page of the New York Times the day after the game.



Definitely? No. But West Germany were closer to the Netherlands than many contemporary accounts would suggest, both in style and and ability.

This really wasn't anything like 1954, when Hungary were clearly the strongest side and West Germany's win felt like a complete injustice. This was the Netherlands being defeated by a less flamboyant side, but one which offered technical skill, tactical quality and a sense of disciplined ruthlessness and defensive quality that all winning sides must possess. Interestingly, some accounts from the time suggest that Poland, rather than either of the finalists, were the most exciting side at the competition.

In World Soccer, Brain Glanville suggested that both the finalists of 1974 would have lost to the Brazil of 1970, and indeed the West German European Championship winners from two years beforehand.

His colleague Eric Batty, in a typically downbeat assessment, referred to “a mediocre West German team… very fortunate winners… like England eight years ago, I doubt if they would be successful anywhere else in the world expect on West German soil.”

If Batty was sick of the hosts winning the World Cup, he would be left further disappointed by the following tournament in Argentina.

The road to the 48-team 2026 FIFA World Cup is well underway, and the first 18 teams have now officially secured their places at the tournament. With these early qualifications, mainly from the AFC and CONMEBOL confederations, we can get a first glimpse at the 'kit maker battle' for the biggest tournament on earth.

So far, Nike has taken an early lead, with Adidas and Puma in pursuit. The lineup also features a diverse range of smaller brands who will get to showcase their designs on the world stage.

As expected, the Swoosh has a strong start with six nations. They have secured two of the three host nations and key teams from South America and Asia.

The Three Stripes are close behind with four key nations, including one of the hosts, Mexico, and the defending champions, Argentina.

Puma also has a solid showing so far, representing teams from three different confederations.

The early qualification stage also highlights a great variety of other brands. Five different suppliers complete the current list of 18 teams.

With 30 more spots still up for grabs, the kit maker battle for the 2026 World Cup is far from over. It will be interesting to see how the brand landscape shifts as teams from Europe and Africa complete their qualification campaigns.

In response to the scheduled FIFA World Cup 2026 events, Atlanta's Mayor Andre Dickens has taken an administrative step meant to reduce the impact on locals. The mayor signed an Executive Order that puts a limit on certain permits associated with the international soccer tournament, according to an official announcement from the City of Atlanta. The aim is to ease the potential strain on City operations and the daily lives of Atlanta residents during the massive sporting event.

As the world turns its eyes to Atlanta for this event, the Executive Order, in its design, intends to balance the excitement of hosting an international spectacle with reality—the continuance of everyday life, marked by personal celebrations and local happenings. Details from the official statement acknowledge that, for residents, ""life still goes on for our residents—birthdays, anniversaries, annual events and other special occasions.""

Mayor Dickens' approach reflects a broader strategy by the City Administration to foster an inclusive environment where residents can choose how to interact with the World Cup festivities. The Executive Order aims to give stakeholders ample time to develop plans that align with residents' preferences and needs around this landmark event.

The focus of the Administration is to not only to be good hosts but also to ensure residents can engage with the World Cup on their own terms. ""The Administration's goal is that all of Atlanta can experience and engage with FIFA World Cup 2026 in the way of their own choosing,"" City of Atlanta affirmed in the recent news release.

Messi was largely contained by Charlotte and Miami looked rudderless without suspended striker Suarez on the pitch

Lionel Messi missed a penalty and the wheels quickly came off for Inter Miami as they slumped to a second straight 3-0 defeat, falling Saturday night to surging Charlotte FC.

Miami started well, pushing higher up the pitch than usual and creating early chances. Jordi Alba forced Kristijan Kahlina into a point-blank save in the sixth minute, and the Herons continued to press until earning their first MLS penalty of the season in the 31st minute.

With regular taker Luis Suárez suspended for his role in a Leagues Cup brawl against Seattle, Messi stepped up. The 38-year-old tried a Panenka, but Kahlina read it all the way. Seconds later, Charlotte punished the miss when Idan Toklomati capped off a blistering counterattack to put the hosts ahead.

Toklomati wasn't finished. Early in the second half, Wilfried Zaha sliced through Miami's defense on the flank and set up the Israeli striker for his second. In the 84th minute, Zaha drew a penalty from Sergio Busquets and, in a show of generosity, handed the ball to Toklomati to complete his first MLS hat-trick.

The result put Charlotte into the record books with a ninth consecutive league win, matching the MLS mark. Miami, meanwhile, are now winless in three of their last four.

When Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram triumphed in a tightly contested doubles rubber Saturday in Delray Beach, it seemed the United States was in control of its Davis Cup Qualifiers Second Round tie against Czechia. But Jiri Lehecka and Jakub Mensik had a plan of their own.

Lehecka upset Taylor Fritz, the No. 5 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, to keep Czechia's hopes alive. Mensik then sealed the tie for his country, 3-2, with a late-night win against Frances Tiafoe.

During a long day in Florida that featured a lengthy lightning delay, Lehecka walked on court at the home of the Delray Beach Open knowing he needed to overcome an 0-4 Lexus ATP Head2Head record against Fritz. The recent US Open quarter-finalist did exactly that, upsetting the American 6-4, 3-6, 6-4.



Fritz fought hard against the Czech, whom he beat in a final-set tie-break in Toronto less than two months ago. But Lehecka put consistent pressure on the top-ranked player in the tie, earning 17 break points and converting three of them to level at 2-2.

That allowed Mensik the opportunity to play the hero in the same state where he claimed ATP Masters 1000 glory earlier this year at the Miami Open presented by Itau. The 23-year-old eased past Tiafoe 6-1, 6-4 around the stroke of midnight to send his country to Bologna.

Krajicek and Ram, the Paris Olympics silver medalists, had given the United States a 2-1 advantage with a battling 7-6(6), 5-7, 6-4 victory against Tomas Machac and Mensik.

The countries that have already qualified for the Davis Cup Final 8 are defending champion Italy, Czechia, Argentina, Austria, Germany and France.

Stan Wawrinka will play for ATP Challenger Tour history on Sunday in Rennes.

The Swiss star will face top seed Hugo Gaston for the Open Blot Rennes trophy. If Wawrinka wins, he will become the oldest ATP Challenger Tour champion ever at 40 years, five months.

The former No. 3 player in the PIF ATP Rankings is already the second-oldest Challenger finalist in history, only behind Ivo Karlovic (40 years, eight months). The oldest Challenger champion is Karlovic, who was 39 years, seven months when he emerged victorious in 2018 in Calgary.

This would also mark Wawrinka's first hard-court title at any level since he triumphed at the 2016 US Open. The Swiss is a three-time major titlist.

Watch the Rennes final not before 3 p.m. CEST / 9 a.m. ET for free on Challenger TV. The stream can also be seen below.

Wawrinka reached the final with a 7-6(3), 6-3 victory against Patrick Zahraj.

Only three players aged 40 and older have made an ATP Challenger Tour final, and Wawrinka has done it twice this year. The Swiss made the championship match at the Aix-en-Provence Challenger, where he fell to former No. 12 Borna Coric in a three-hour, 11-minute final.

 Pedro Martinez brought Spain back from the brink of elimination in the Davis Cup Qualifiers second round on Sunday, when the World No. 67 upset Holger Rune in dramatic fashion to help his country book a spot at the Final 8. 

 With Spain trailing 1-2 in the Marbella tie, Martinez saved a match point with Rune serving at 5-3, 40/30 in the deciding set. He went on to crucially complete a break of serve in that game before sealing a 6-1, 4-6, 7-6(3) triumph. 

 That set the stage for former World No. 10 Pablo Carreno Busta, who duly overcame Elmer Moeller 6-2, 6-3 to ensure the six-time champion Spain will compete in the Final 8 in November in Bologna. Earlier in the day, Martinez and Jaume Munar had reenergised Spanish hopes with a vital 1-6, 6-3, 6-2 doubles win against August Holmgren and Johannes Ingildsen. 



 With his singles victory against Rune, Martinez improved to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Rune. The 28-year-old Spaniard also downed the Dane in straight sets in Rotterdam in February. 

 ""The feeling [at Davis Cup] is totally different,” said Martinez after his win. “Maybe I get more nervous but, this adrenaline, it doesn't work on some players. On me it gives me an extra motivation to play full. I feel the nerves, but I can handle them, and I think this motivation plays in my favour. 

 ""Hopefully I can continue playing like this in Davis Cup. For me it's one of the most important things in my career.""

 Collingnon The Hero Again For Belgium 
Raphael Collignon capped a dream weekend at the Davis Cup qualifiers for both himself and Belgium with a decisive comeback victory against Aleksandar Vukic on Sunday in Sydney.
 Having battled cramps on Saturday during a three-set upset of World No. 8 Alex de Minaur, Collignon outlasted Vukic 6-7(5), 6-2, 6-3 to earn Belgium a stunning 3-2 win at Ken Rosewall Arena. The No. 91 in the PIF ATP Rankings broke Vukic's serve twice in each of the second and third sets to complete a memorable triumph for the European nation.

Unseeded players Emiliana Arango and Iva Jovic will each play for her first WTA singles title at the Guadalajara Open Akron. Arango defeated Jacquemot while Jovic outlasted Bartunkova in a thrilling match.

Either Emiliana Arango or Iva Jovic will join the exclusive club of first-time title-winners on the Hologic WTA Tour this season at the Guadalajara Open Akron after the two won semifinal matches between unseeded players on Saturday evening.

Guadalajara: Scores | Draw | Order of play

Colombia's Arango, a runner-up in Mérida in February, made Mexican magic again with a 6-4, 7-5 win over France's Elsa Jacquemot in the first semifinal, before Jovic -- the youngest player inside the Top 100 of the PIF WTA Rankings -- outlasted fellow teenager Nikola Bartunkova in another thrilling nightcap 6-3, 6-7(5), 6-3. 

Either Arango or Jovic will join Maya Joint (Rabat), Lois Boisson (Hamburg) and Victoria Mboko (Montreal) as first-time singles champions on tour this season -- as well as the winner of the concurrent SP Open final between Indonesia's Janice Tjen and France's Tiantsoa Rakotomanga Rajaonah in Sao Paulo. 

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

World No. 86 Arango first broke through in Guadalajara two years ago, when she became the first Colombian in nearly 20 years to make the quarterfinals at a WTA 1000 event. Earlier this year, her love affair with Mexico continued as she reached her first WTA singles final as a qualifier -- before becoming just the fifth player in the last 25 years to lose a tour final 6-0, 6-0.

There hasn't been any sour taste from that result in her return to the country, however; she has yet to drop a set in four matches -- and against Jacquemot, she put together a run of games at the end of each frame to seal victory.

In the opener, Arango trailed 4-2, and also saved two break points that would've put Jacquemot ahead 5-3. In set two, she was two points from being pushed to a decider at 30-30 in the 10th game. But she not only held in that game, but broke serve after denying Jacquemot a point for 6-5 with a stunning display of athleticism. 

To reach her first tour-level final -- she won a WTA 125 crown in June -- Jovic came through her second barnburner against another teenager in as many days. Against Victoria Jimenez Kasintseva in the quarterfinals, the 17-year-old was forced to save match point -- and though she led throughout against Bartunkova, she needed nearly 3 hours to come through in the end.

Things got complicated for the American from a set and a break ahead, and she dropped serve for the first time since the fifth game of the match to put Bartunkova level in the second set. In the ensuing tiebreak, Jovic led 4-0 -- and was two points from victory at 5-4 -- before the Czech pushed the match the distance.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Jovic's endurance ultimately proved a difference-maker. Midway through the decider, Bartunkova went off-court for a medical timeout -- but continued to battle hard before succumbing. In a tense final game, she saved two match points -- and had four break points to get things back on serve -- before Jovic's bold play (and just her second ace) combined to put her through.

Lehecka came into the fourth match of the tie having lost four prior meetings with Fritz, including a three-tiebreak affair in Toronto just last month.

Down a set and a break at 6-1, 1-0, Tiafoe found some life, and stayed ahead for much of the second set after breaking served for 1-1. But Mensik had the final word, and won the last three games.

Instead, though, it was the 20-year-old who earned his fourth, shaking off any lingering disappointment from the defeat he suffered with Tomas Machac to Krajicek and Ram from earlier in the day.The first set between Mensik and Tiafoe lasted under a half hour, with the world No. 17 winning the first 12 points of the tilt. Down a set and a break at 6-1, 1-0, Tiafoe found some life, and stayed ahead for much of the second set after breaking served for 1-1. But Mensik had the final word, and won the last three games.

NEW YORK—Over the years, tennis has become the domain of sporting gladiators trained almost from the cradle to pursue perfect technique, impeccable form, and elegant strokes that leaves no stylistic or physical weaknesses for an opponent to exploit.Once the tour had a healthy helping of unorthodox players, but outliers, iconoclasts, merchants of quirk—even flakes—are in even shorter supply than one-handed backhands. A few still survive, though, most notably Jenson Brooksby. He is a 24-year old, broad-shouldered, Californian who stands 6-foot-4, but often hits first serves with less pace than seconds. Many of either variety clock in under 100 mph, in an era when 135-mph deliveries barely warrant a raised eyebrow.“I guess you could use that word ‘quirky,'” Brooksby said when I broached the subject in an interview at the US Open, shortly after Brooksby was beaten by Flavio Cobolli in a wildly-entertaining second-round rumble on Stadium Court 17. The match lasted just over four-and-a-half hours, and ended with Cobolli, the No. 24 seed, claiming the match tiebreaker, 5-7, 6-3, 6-4, 2-6, 7-6(3).

“I'm just unorthodox, but I think it's a strength,” Brooksby said. “I have a lot of different shots and I can use them maybe because I naturally see the court a little better than some other guys.”Those “different shots” include a topspin forehand that is the closest thing in tennis to a major league knuckleball, a backhand volley and slice groundstroke that Brooksby often hits with both hands remaining on the handle for a longer time than anyone would recommend. Then there are those odd, soft bunts—neither drop shot nor volley. Brooksby's takeback is extremely short, and it launches a backhand that is bullet fast and flat as a laser beam.Overall, Brooksby's game looks like it was assembled from a bin of random spare parts, and that's partly what makes it so effective.

The first set of Brooksby's match with Cobolli was full of fireworks, with both men blasting deep, scorching groundstrokes and pulling each other well outside the sidelines. They redirected rallies to keep things interesting, and played spectacular defense.In the 11th game, Brooksby converted his fourth break point for a 6-5 lead, then deftly served it out. He also broke immediately to start the second set, then held. He had Cobolli on the ropes but his intensity declined and Cobolli clawed his way back, built a 4-2 lead, and claimed the set. After that, it was a see-saw battle all the way to the fifth set tiebreaker, in which Brooksby made some early errors to fall behind 7-1, and never recovered.There's a further, intriguing complication in Brooksby's CV. He was born with autism spectrum disorder, the condition severe enough to keep him non-verbal until the age of four. Managing it required ABA therapy for about 40 hours a week. Brooksby, who has been open and frank about his medical history, said that he's much better now, but still has to guard against losing focus and becoming distracted.Read more: Why Jenson Brooksby's autism “is a superpower”

Watching Brooksby at his labors might leave you wondering here he would be ranked (he's currently No. 92) had he not been obliged to sit out a 13-month suspension (for missing three out-of-competition doping tests). When it ended last March, he was still recovering from a shoulder injury and two wrist surgeries the kept him off the tour until this year.Brooksby's path through the profession has been an extraordinary journey of highs and lows. In his first official ATP tour match, as a qualifier in 2019 in Flushing Meadows, he beat former world No. 4 Tomas Berdych in what would be the final match of the Czech star's career. Brooksby then missed the entire 2020 season with a toe injury.A wild-card entry in the 2021 US Open, Brooksby upset compatriot Taylor Fritz and became the youngest American since Andy Roddick in 2002 to reach the fourth round (where he lost to Novak Djokovic). On the rise in the ensuing months, his ranking topped out at No. 33 in June of 2022.

I can't control the past, so all I hope for at this point is that I can finish my career a little later, you know, say like mid-30s or something rather than 30. Jenson Brooksby

Things went sideways not long after that, pretty much until this year. He was ranked No. 507 in March in the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships, where he saved three match points in an early round, then toppled No. 1 seed Tommy Paul and No. 2 Frances Tiafoe in short order to become the third lowest-ranked champion in ATP history.“I'm still newer to it [the tour] than most 24-year-olds,” he said. “I can't control the past, so all I hope for at this point is that I can finish my career a little later, you know, say like mid-30s or something rather than 30.”

Brooksby's wrists remain a chief source of anxiety. It isn't often that a player feels relief after losing an excruciatingly close five-set match, but here's Brooksby: “The biggest concern for me, really, over anything, has been my own body. How would I react physically to this level? But I think as this year's gone on, I've proved to myself that I'm able to last in long matches like this one.”We can only hope that Brooksby can stay healthy and continue to build his stamina and form. Tennis needs the outliers, the unorthodox, the iconoclasts. Players who win in spite of their shortcomings rather than because of their strengths just could be the most compelling figures in this sport. But turning those shortcomings into strengths, the way Brooksby does, is magical.

Carlos Alcaraz didn't care what he had seen out of his teammate those two days.With his team trailing 4-8, the Spaniard nevertheless tipped Ruud as the person he wanted to share the court with to kick off the final day of play.“I felt like I'd never played doubles before, I felt embarrassed, but I went to bed knowing Carlos had said he'd like to play doubles with me,” shared Ruud.A good night's rest was followed by a chance for Ruud to carry out his own form of revenge. For he would find Ben Shelton across the night less than 24 hours after being humbled by the American and his fellow left-handed partner Alejandro Tabilo.

One strategic shakeup, moving Ruud from the ad to the deuce court, would prove pivotal in reversing the outcome.

The top People's Choice honor was unveiled Sunday as Hollywood's awards season kicks into gear after Venice and Telluride.


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


	Chloé Zhao's Hamnet picked up the top People's Choice honor Sunday at the Toronto Film Festival during a 50th edition that followed Venice, Telluride and Cannes.


	The Nomadland director's adaptation of Maggie O'Farrell's novel, a fictionalized account of Shakespeare and his wife as they fall in love, stars Paul Mescal as the Bard. The drama bowed in Telluride, where it garnered critical praise, especially for leading lady Jessie Buckley, and had a Canadian premiere in Toronto. Nomadland also earned the People's Choice award in Toronto in 2020.

	Zhao accepted the top audience prize at Toronto via a video link, and expressed gratitude and stressed the importance of making an audience connection with her work. “I'd like to share that I was very lonely when I was young. And I wrote stories and I drew manga, and I put them on the Internet so that I could read the comments and the reactions of strangers. Whether they liked them or not, I felt connected to them, and suddenly the world is a little less of a lonely place and life seems to have more meaning,” the director recalled in her acceptance speech.

	Angie Han, a film critic for The Hollywood Reporter, in her Telluride review of the Shakespeare-inspired drama wrote: “In Hamnet, the latest film from Oscar-winning Nomadland director Chloé Zhao, the two always go hand in hand: joy and fear, love and loss. One feeds into the other in a cycle as old as life itself, and unavoidable. But just as her William Shakespeare (Paul Mescal) turns the pain of being caught between the two into the masterpiece that is Hamlet, Zhao harnesses those elements into something gorgeous and cathartic.”

	











	The first runner-up for the top audience prize was Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein, an adaptation of the classic Mary Shelley novel that was shot mostly in and around Toronto, while the second runner-up was Rian Johnson's Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery, which had a world premiere at TIFF.  


	The win for Hamnet came as Hollywood's awards season kicks into gear. In 2024, Mike Flanagan's The Life of Chuck nabbed the top People's Choice honor, with Jacques Audiard's Emilia Pérez and Sean Baker's Anora in runner-up positions.   


	The audience award for best Midnight Madness title at TIFF went to Matt Johnson's Nirvanna the Band the Show the Movie. The first runner-up is Obsession, directed by Curry Barker, and the second runner-up is The Furious, from director Kenji Tanigaki.


	Elsewhere, the People's Choice award for best international film went to director Park Chan-wook's No Other Choice, with Joachim Trier's Sentimental Value, the Grand Prix winner in Cannes that stars Stellan Skarsgård and Renate Reinsve, as the first runner-up, followed by Neeraj Ghaywan's Homebound as the second runner up. 


	And the People's Choice award for best documentary went to Barry Avrich's The Road Between Us, the Oct. 7, 2023-themed film that ignited controversy at TIFF when it was invited and then disinvited and finally reinstated by TIFF programmers. The first runner-up in the category is EPIC: Elvis Presley in Concert by Baz Luhrmann, and the second runner-up is You Had to Be There: How the Toronto Godspell Ignited the Comedy Revolution, from director Nick Davis.

	











	The People's Choice awards are voted on by TIFF attendees, and in all 14 audience and juried awards were handed out on Sunday morning in Toronto. To prevent festgoers voting more than once for the same film, TIFF matches email addresses to ticket-buyer information, and verifies vote origin against IP addresses.


	While not voting for the same film more than once, TIFF patrons can vote for as many different films as they want, but have to have bought a ticket to an individual film they vote.


	As in recent years, TIFF's 2025 edition was overshadowed by Venice and Cannes, as Toronto hosted no official press conferences to help market films ahead of the awards season, and Toronto has no official film competition. As Hollywood contracts, celebrities made red carpet appearances in Toronto and took selfies with fans, but without the glitz and glamour as on the Croisette and the Lido.


	In juried prize-giving, To The Victory!, director Valentyn Vasyanovych's dark comedy about Ukraine's post-war future and who also plays the main character, won the Platform prize.


	The FIPRESCI prize went to Spanish filmmaker Lucía Aleñar Iglesias' Forastera, a directorial debut that stars Zoe Stein and Martina García, and the NETPAC award for the best Asian film by a first- or second-time feature director at TIFF went to Jitank Singh Gurjar for his second feature In Search of the Sky.


	The Canadian Discovery Award for emerging filmmakers went to Sophy Romvari's Locarno prize winner Blue Heron, about eight-year-old Sasha and her Hungarian immigrant family relocating to a new home on Vancouver Island. 

	











	“This is very relevant to the society that we live in, and the world we live in, and to acknowledge the ongoing genocide in Palestine,” Romvari told a Lightbox audience when accepting her award on Sunday.


	And the best Canadian feature film prize picked by a TIFF jury went to Zacharias Kunuk's Inuk historical drama Uiksaringitara (Wrong Husband) after a North American premiere in Toronto.


	The Short Cuts award for best international short film went to Joecar Hanna's Talk Me, executive produced by Spike Lee and which bowed in Cannes, while the best animated short was picked up by French director Agnes Patron for To The Woods, which had a North American premiere at TIFF.

	And the best Canadian short film went to The Girl Who Cried Pearls, a stop motion animated film from Oscar-nominated Canadian filmmakers Chris Lavis and Maciek Szczerbowski, with backing from the National Film Board of Canada, while the Vimeo Staff-Pick trophy went to Afghan filmmaker Salar Pashtoonyar's I Fear Blue Skies.


	On the film sales front, no major deals were unveiled in Toronto during the past 10 days as Toronto continues to be mostly a launchpad for movies, often feel-good and escapist fare destined for streaming platforms, and already with U.S. distribution. 


	The muted informal sales market comes ahead of Toronto being set to launch an official content market, named The Market, in 2026.

Cox stressed on several Sunday morning news shows that investigators are still trying to pin down a motive, but that there was ""clearly a leftist ideology.""


							By 

	The Associated Press



	Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Sunday that investigators are not ready to discuss the motive behind the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. But he said the suspect had left-leaning political beliefs, disliked the conservative influencer and is being uncooperative in custody.


	“Clearly a leftist ideology,” Cox told NBC's Meet the Press. On CNN's State of the Union, he said, “That information comes from the people around him, his family members and friends.”




	Cox said Robinson, 22, is “not cooperating” and that friends paint a picture of someone radicalized in the dark corners of the internet. “Clearly there was a lot of gaming going on,” Cox said on NBC. “Friends have confirmed that there was kind of that deep, dark internet, the Reddit culture, and these other dark places of the internet where this person was going deep.”

	A Republican who's called on all partisans to tone down their rhetoric following the attack, the governor added: “I really don't have a dog in this fight. If this was a radicalized MAGA person, I'd be saying that as well.”


	Cox stressed on several Sunday morning news shows, however, that investigators are still trying to pin down a motive for the attack on the father of two and Trump confidant, who was killed Wednesday while on one of his signature college speaking tours at Utah Valley University. The governor said more information may come out once the suspect, Tyler Robinson, appears in court Tuesday.

	











	The governor said the suspect's partner was transgender, which some politicians have pointed to as a sign Robinson was targeting Kirk for his anti-trans views. But authorities have not said whether it is relevant as they investigate Robinson's motive.


	“The roommate was a romantic partner, a male transitioning to female,” Cox said. “I can say that he has been incredibly cooperative, this partner has been very cooperative, had no idea that this was happening.”

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox confirms that the roommate of Charlie Kirk's alleged assassin was a romantic partner transitioning from male to female but declined to speculate whether that was a factor in the shooter's motive, telling Dana Bash, “This partner has been incredibly… pic.twitter.com/xrFabx7rsO


	Investigators have spoken to Robinson's relatives and carried out a search warrant at his family's home in Washington, about 240 miles (390 kilometers) southwest of Utah Valley University, where the shooting took place.


	State records show Robinson is registered to vote but not affiliated with a political party and is listed as inactive, meaning he did not vote in the two most recent general elections. His parents are registered Republicans.


	Ammunition found with the weapon used to kill Kirk was engraved with taunting, anti-fascist and meme-culture messages. Court records show that one bullet casing had the message, “Hey, fascist! Catch!”


	Robinson grew up around St. George, in the southwestern corner of Utah between Las Vegas and natural landmarks including Bryce Canyon and Zion National Parks.


	Robinson became a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, known widely as the Mormon church, at a young age, church spokesperson Doug Andersen said.

	











	Robinson has two younger brothers, and his parents have been married for about 25 years, according to social media posts. Online activity by Robinson's mother reflects an active family that took vacations to Disneyland, Hawaii, the Caribbean and Alaska.


	Like many in that part of Utah, they frequently spent time outdoors — boating, fishing, riding ATVs, zip-lining and target shooting. A 2017 post shows the family visiting a military facility and posing with assault rifles. A young Robinson is seen smiling as he grips the handles of a .50-caliber heavy machine gun.


	A high school honor roll student who scored in the 99th percentile nationally on standardized tests, he was admitted to Utah State University in 2021 on a prestigious academic scholarship, according to a video of him reading his acceptance letter that was posted to a family member's social media account.


	But he attended for only one semester, according to the university. He is currently enrolled as a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College in St. George.

Molly Shannon and Kumail Nanjiani also appear in the film about a high school student who hijacks his driving instructor's car in a bid to win back his college girlfriend. 


							By 

	Michael Rechtshaffen



	In introducing his new comedy just ahead of its TIFF world premiere, director Bobby Farrelly noted that Dumb and Dumber, the 1994 release that introduced him and brother Peter to jaded audiences hankering for something edgier or grosser, or, yes, dumber, was also a road movie. But while that 1994 Jim Carrey-Jeff Daniels hit firmly established the Farrelly Brothers brand, the latest solo effort is pretty benign stuff by comparison.


	In Driver's Ed, an earnest but naive high school senior (Sam Nivola), worried that his college freshman girlfriend may have broken up with him, commandeers his driving instructor's canary-yellow KIA and, joined by three classmates, embarks on a three-hour excursion to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to ensure his fears are unfounded. Those expecting more of a Farrelly-style joyride will have to settle for a casual Sunday drive that cruises along pleasantly but without inspiration, following safely within the established boundaries of Thomas Moffett's formulaic script. Granted there's nothing inherently wrong with that approach and, fueled by a charismatic young cast, the vehicle reaches its intended destination with few wrong turns on the way.

Venue: Toronto International Film Festival (Gala Presentations)Cast: Sam Nivola, Sophie Telegadis, Mohana Krishnan, Aidan Laprete, Molly Shannon, Kumail NanjianiDirector: Bobby FarrellyScreenwriter: Thomas Moffett

								1 hour 42 minutes			






	Handed its gala premiere at the tail end of TIFF, the picture has yet to secure a U.S. distributor. Prime Video has it for Canada.

	Nivola, who recently made an impression as Jason Issacs' and Parker Posey's sensitive youngest kid in the third season of White Lotus, is well cast as lovelorn Jeremy, a Wes Anderson-obsessed budding filmmaker who fails to see what everyone around him knows all to well — that his girlfriend, Samantha (Lilah Pate), has moved on.

	











	Still unconvinced, he makes the decision to hear it from the source while in the middle of a driving lesson being given by Kumail Nanjiani's Mr. Rivers, a card-carrying goofball of a substitute instructor with both of his arms in a cast. Opting to accompany Jeremy on his fact-finding mission are cynical Evie (Sophie Telegadis), overachieving valedictorian Apurna (Mohana Krishnan) and, most notably, the high school's permanently stoned resident drug dealer Yoshi (Aidan Laprete, handily stealing every scene with his pitch-perfect deadpan line-readings).


	Meanwhile, harried Principal Fisher (the always reliable Molly Shannon) is doggedly determined to track down the motley crew, snarling “I'm not going to let three dipshits and the valedictorian f-ck me out of tenure!”


	Aside from encountering a few inevitable bumps in the road, including an empty gas gauge and almost running over a three-legged cat whom they name Tripod, the trip functions mainly as a journey of self-discovery. The compact KIA functions as a rolling confessional in which the young passengers share their deepest fears, darkest secrets and the realization that they're all on the same anxiety and depression meds. It all culminates at a prolonged frat party that allows the characters to pair off predictably, arriving at the sort of conclusion that feels like peak John Hughes.


	Allowing everything to unfold at an unhurried pace, underscored by a gentle acoustic John Frizzell score, Farrelly hasn't lost the knack he shared with his brother for mining promising young talent and giving them a platform to shine. Following in the career-boosting footsteps of the likes of Jim Carrey, Ben Stiller, Cameron Diaz and Anthony Anderson, Laprete makes a lasting, tragicomic impression here, which could be a jumping-off point for his film and television future, provided he's able to sidestep inevitable typecasting.

	











	Maybe it was too much to have expected something fresher than the totally 80s feel-good vibe that Drivers' Ed is content to deliver, but considering the source, the comedy can't help but feel unmotivated. It's what the kids today would call mid.

Ben Foster and Pablo Schreiber also star in Potsy Ponciroli's violent crime thriller set in 1977 Detroit, which played at both the Venice and Toronto Film Festivals.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	Give me a brooding mid-1970s Detroit nightscape stained with grubby neon, drop a body with a severed leg off a building and crank up a David Bowie song and you have my attention. But director Potsy Ponciroli's vicious revenge saga, Motor City, while impressively sustained on many levels and even fun in a mindless exploitation way, can't get around a gimmicky script by Chad St. John populated with pulp-crime stereotypes in boilerplate situations.


	A glowering Alan Ritchson brings gravitas by virtue of his hulking physical presence alone, but Shailene Woodley, Ben Foster and Pablo Schreiber are stuck playing characters too familiar to pack much heat.

The Bottom Line

	
	Bracing for a while, then just flashy and thin.
	



Venue: Venice Film Festival (Spotlight)Cast: Alan Ritchson, Shailene Woodley, Ben Foster, Pablo Schreiber, Lionel Boyce, Amar Chadha-Patel, Ben McKenzieDirector: Potsy PonciroliScreenwriter: Chad St. John

								1 hour 43 minutes			






	The audacious stunt behind the project is to build an adrenaline-charged crime thriller almost entirely without dialogue. It requires skill to sustain such a conceit and Ponciroli largely pulls it off, but a stunt is exactly what it ends up being. For a while the fabulous ‘70s needle drops — Fleetwood Mac, Bill Withers, Donna Summer, the Moody Blues — keep it punchy and there's certainly some well-staged action, notably toward the end. But you can only get so far with one-dimensional characters.




			Related Video		







	Thankfully, Ritchson, still very much in the built-like-a-brick-shithouse punisher mode of Reacher, doesn't require a lot of nuance as John Miller, a blue-collar guy who gets caught in the web of scuzzy underworld drug kingpin Reynolds (Foster). That's Miller disposing of a body in the kinetic opening before hitting the streets, blasting the head off one bad dude, getting thrown from the hood of another guy's muscle car — in slow-mo, Ponciroli's favorite device — and shooting at the driver as a freeze-frame leaves him hanging.

	











	The timeline then jumps around, winding back first to Miller proposing to his diner waitress girlfriend Sophia (Woodley), just in time for cops to lob a teargas cannister through the window and burst in. They arrest him for the major cocaine haul found in his car trunk, which, unbeknownst to Sophia, was planted there. No prizes for guessing which of the detectives on the scene is corrupt — clean-cut Kent (Ben McKenzie) in his respectable gray suit, or Savick (Pablo Schreiber) in his black leather regulation pimp-daddy trench coat.


	Tossed into prison on false charges, Miller's memories return to the night he met Sophia. He is smoking a cigarette in the alley behind a club when she comes slinking over to get a light, poured into a barely-there gold metallic mesh minidress. She soon locks him in a kiss, which Reynolds isn't too happy about when he steps out of the club, the ensuing altercation sealing the hostility between the two men.


	Back in the movie's present, Reynolds has no qualms about revealing he was behind the frame-up, dropping in on Miller in the police interrogation room just to toss the engagement ring the arrested man gave to Sophia and leave without a word. Reynolds goads Miller by sending a photo of himself getting cozy with Sophia, and in a moment both lurid and laughable, the prisoner visualizes the two of them getting naked and going at it right outside the cell.


	Cue jailbreak and operation vendetta. Miller shows craft aptitude that would make Martha Stewart proud, fashioning himself a shiv out of a mold he carves in a bar of soap. He also has help from two associates on the outside, the savvy Youngblood (Lionel Boyce from The Bear) and the deadly Singh (Amar Chadha-Patel), the latter's part of the ingenious getaway plan setting up the requisite shot of badasses sauntering away from a wall of fire.

	











	The mayhem that follows builds via creditable fight choreography and operatic violence to Miller's inevitable faceoff with Reynolds. But first, he and his crew must get past Savick, resulting in a visceral clash on a stairwell between the crooked cop and Singh, followed by an even bloodier mano-a-mano with blades while Miller and Savick share the tight confines of an elevator.


	Those pulse-pounding action set-pieces have so much bone-crunching power that the showdown with Reynolds feels anticlimactic — especially because for no good reason it involves a forward time jump and some unconvincing old-guy makeup.


	The energy also takes a dip when Ponciroli quits with the evocative ‘70s song selections — or runs out of music-rights cash — and leans more exclusively on composer Steve Jablonsky's moody but generic synth score. While he's credited only for a cameo role and as one of about 300 executive producers, Jack White reportedly had a hand in overseeing the use of music, and his barnburner song “Archbishop Harold Holmes” provides a rousing end-credits outro.


	While so many brawny, testosterone-fueled action thrillers fall prey to risible dialogue — which only someone like a winking Jason Statham is able to get away with — Motor City is rendered a bit silly by its silence. (At least, verbal silence; there's plenty of other noise to keep the wheels turning.)


	Woodley's character remains ambiguous for too long, especially when she's flouncing around like a femme fatale in sunglasses, big hair and furs the size of Alan Ritchson. By the time we're clued into where Sophia's loyalty really lies, it becomes hard to care about her outcome. Given an even sketchier character outline, Foster — who takes the gold in a movie that's the Olympics of bad wigs — just sails over the top, taking his cue from a wardrobe of regrettable ‘70s fashions, with chunky gold chains nestled in a thick carpet of chest hair. 

	











	Schreiber does marginally better because his role is mostly physical, but McKenzie gets too little screen time to register. Could somebody please find a way to use this terrific actor in movies?


	It's Ritchson (also a producer) who keeps the thriller reasonably taut with his wall-of-muscle presence and simmering mix of heartache and rage. He's helped by John Matysiak's propulsive cinematography and production design by Mayne Berke that nails the desired vibe of a dying industrial city experiencing a spread of drug deals and other crime. (Punk fans will get a kick out of seeing the Ramones on the Fox Theatre marquee, not that they ever played there.)


	Ponciroli managed to freshen up classic Western archetypes in 2021's Old Henry, but his latest attempt at genre reinvention gets hobbled by a weak script and a stylistic gimmick that runs its course just as the movie should be revving up. While it's not without entertainment value, Motor City feels like it wants to be Don Siegel meets Michael Mann meets Walter Hill with a dash of John Woo, but ends up an ersatz version of all their work.

At long last, Netflix's new Witcher springs into action, replacing Henry Cavill. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	Ready to meet the new Geralt of Rivia? 


Netflix has released the first footage (below) introducing Liam Hemsworth taking over the fantasy drama's role for the show's fourth season. This marks the first video of The Hunger Games star as the grim monster slayer following Henry Cavill's announcement that he was departed the role three years ago. Also, Netflix revealed the season's premiere date as Oct. 30.




	The new season's official description: “After the Continent-altering events of Season Three, Geralt, Yennefer (Anya Chalotra), and Ciri (Freya Allan) find themselves separated by a raging war and countless enemies. As their paths diverge and their goals sharpen, they stumble on unexpected allies eager to join their journeys. And if they can accept these found families, they just might have a chance at reuniting for good.”

	Netflix has previously announced the show will end with season five. “This is the beginning of a two-season journey for our family to finally reunite and be together — hopefully forever,” Hissrich says. 


	When Cavill announced he was quitting the series, later suggesting it was over creative differences, he posted the following statement: “My journey as Geralt of Rivia has been filled with both monsters and adventures, and alas, I will be laying down my medallion and my swords for Season 4. In my stead, the fantastic Mr Liam Hemsworth will be taking up the mantle of the White Wolf. As with the greatest of literary characters, I pass the torch with reverence for the time spent embodying Geralt and enthusiasm to see Liam's take on this most fascinating and nuanced of men.”


	For his part, Hemsworth has said he is “over the moon” to be stepping in as Geralt of Rivia. “Henry Cavill has been an incredible Geralt, and I'm honoured that he's handing me the reins and allowing me to take up the White Wolf's blades for the next chapter of his adventure,” Hemsworth's statement read. “Henry, I've been a fan of yours for years and was inspired by what you brought to this beloved character. I may have some big boots to fill, but I'm truly excited to be stepping into The Witcher world.”


	In The Hollywood Reporter's cover story with Cavill from November 2021, Cavill said he planned to follow through with The Witcher series through at least seven seasons. “Absolutely,” Cavill said at the time. “As long as we can keep telling great stories which honor Sapkowski's work.”

	











	Cavill is currently working on another sword-swinging epic, a remake of Highlander, though a recent injury has caused the production to be pushed to 2026.

	JADE's debut album ‘That's Showbiz Baby!' dropped today, and the Little Mix singer shared with the Billboard Pop Shop Podcast how Madonna inspired the album, her transition from writing music for her girl group to solo, and more! (You can listen to the full podcast episode next week.)


	What did you think of ‘That's Showbiz Baby!'? Let us know in the comments!


	JADE:


	Especially in the next few weeks, I just want to be super present with this record. It's something I'm so proud of and waited a long time for, and I want it to feel like a celebration between me and my fans. I feel like I've waited a long time for this moment, and I've talked about it so much, and I've hinted at it, and, you know, I've released all my singles, and got to this point, and now that I'm actually here on it, oh, wow. Like, I really am about to, you know, release a debut album, it's a pretty big deal. Like, musically, I kind of had an inkling of where I might go. There was a song I wrote for the girls on our fifth album called “Wasabi.” And it kind of became a fan favorite, and it became almost known as, like, my song within the group. And so I kind of knew that that would be a good starting point. But I think lyrically, it wasn't until after, I think because I was so used to writing lyrics that were very universal or very, you know, like, relatable for everyone, because in a group, you can't be too personal. It's not just about you. So it wasn't until afterwards, when I was in rooms on my own, and, you know, getting more confident and realizing, oh, like, I actually can just literally write about anything now, and I can be, you know, almost uncomfortably honest at times with my own experience. And I think what really excited me was there was still so much that people didn't know about me on my own.

Brian Kilmeade apologized for comments he made about homeless individuals during a segment on Fox & Friends last week.


	Kilmeade, co-host of Fox & Friends, appeared on Fox & Friends Weekend on Sunday, telling viewers, “In the morning, we were discussing the murder of Iryna Zarutska in Charlotte, North Carolina and how to stop these kinds of attacks by homeless, mentally ill assailants, including institutionalizing or jailing such people so they cannot attack again. Now during that discussion, I wrongly said they should get lethal injections. I apologize for that extremely callous remark. I am obviously aware that not all mentally ill, homeless people act as the perpetrator did in North Carolina, and that so many homeless people deserve our empathy and compassion.”

	Jones, talking about the mental health crisis, said, “we should have to live in fear while they figure out what is going on right there. Put them in a mental institution. Put them in a jail. You got to figure it out. People having to duck and dive on the trains and the buses, walking through the street, this is one case, but this is happening all across the country. And it is not a money issue. They have given billions of dollars to mental health and the homeless population. A lot of them don't want to take the programs. A lot of them don't want to get the help that is necessary. You can't give them a choice. Either you take the resources that we are going to give you, or you decide that you are going to be locked up in jail. That is the way it has to be now.”

	











	Kilmeade then added, “Or involuntary lethal injection or something. Just kill them.”‘


	It wasn't until Saturday that the comments spread across social media, perhaps because the news cycle since then has been dominated by the killing of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk.


	The attack on Zarutska, a refugee from Ukraine, has drawn national attention, as President Donald Trump has pointed to it as an example of the leniency of judges in Democratic-controlled metro areas, given that the suspect had a prior criminal record.


	Decarlos Dejuan Brown Jr., 34, was arrested and faces a state first degree murder charge and a federal charge of committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system.

If someone on MSNBC or CNN said that statement they would have already been fired but on FOX faux news a comment like that gets you a bonus!!!

He should have been fired.  I thought these guys were prolife and the followers of Jesus

Too little, too late. Those hateful words came from somewhere inside. They are still there.

He can apoligize for saying it but it doesnt change the core feeling he has on the matter. Cant take back the words once spoken and those words are unacceptable. He should be fired.

apologizing for what you really believe….won't work. It's like a cat trying to hide a “tootsie” roll in a catbox.  It's never successful and it still stinks to high heaven.

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	The People's Choice Award from the just-wrapped 50th Toronto Film Festival has gone to Chloé Zhao's Hamnet, first runner-up is Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein and second runner-up is Rian Johnson's Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery. Hamnet hails from Focus Features, while latter two are from Netflix.


	Also in the awards revealed Sunday, the newly created International People's Choice Award went to Park Chan-wook's No Other Choice. The Documentary winner was Barry Avrich's The Road Between Us: The Ultimate Rescue. 


			Watch on Deadline		







	Voted on by audience members since 1978 and often considered a harbinger for the Best Picture Oscar, the People's Choice Award has been won by such eventual Best Picture Academy Award winners as Nomadland, Green Book, 12 Years a Slave, The King's Speech, Slumdog Millionaire, American Beauty and Chariots of Fire. Among those that went on to Best Picture nominations include last year's winner American Fiction as well as The Fabelmans, Belfast, JoJo Rabbit, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri, Room, La La Land, The Imitation Game, Silver Linings Playbook, Precious, Life Is Beautiful, Places in the Heart and The Big Chill.

	











	Last year's surprise winner, The Life of Chuck, had no North American distributor in place and was later picked up by Neon and released this summer, making it Oscar eligible this year, just as the new People's Choice winner is. So we shall see how the tradition of TIFF and Oscar hold up in this regard. Last year both the first runner-up Emilia Pérez and second runner-up Anora went on to a collective 19 Oscar nominations between them, both nominated for Best Picture, with Anora winning.


Hamnet is a historical drama co-written, co-edited and directed by Zhao, based on Maggie O'Farrell's 2020 novel. Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal star in the emotionally charged drama that premiered at the Telluride Film Festival and had its international premiere at TIFF. It is considered a major Oscar contender from Focus and Amblin' Entertainment and represents Zhao's second People's Choice Award at TIFF after 2020's Nomadland, which went on to win the Best Picture Oscar.

	











	The pic is set for a limited Thanksgiving release November 27 and a wide release starting December 12.


	Here is the list of this year's TIFF award winners:

No surprise that Hamnet took first place seeing as how it appears to be the Best Picture frontrunner at the moment with its glowing reviews (90 on Metacritic). Rather surprising, though, that Frankenstein took second given the merely ok reviews.

Frankenstein has not been well received overall. This was a weird choice.

Sucks that No Other Choice was stuck in a different category. What if it was the better film?

	As the killing of Charlie Kirk sparks mass partisan fallout, it seems Chris Martin is trying to keep the peace with a message of love.


	During the band's final stop on their Music of the Spheres World Tour on Friday in London, the Coldplay frontman encouraged the audience to send love “to Charlie Kirk's family” following the conservative influencer's death this week.


	“Let's raise our hands like this and send love anywhere you wanna send it in the world, and there are so many places that might need it today,” he said onstage at Wembley Stadium. “So, here it comes from London. You can send this to your brother or sister, you can send it to the families of people who have been going through terrible stuff.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Martin continued, “You can send it to Charlie Kirk's family, you can send it to anybody's family. You can send it to people you disagree with, but you send them love anyway. You can send it to peaceful people in the Middle East and Ukraine and Russia and Azerbaijan and Sudan and London, anywhere you think might need love from London. Here it comes.”


	Kirk, a conservative influencer and the co-founder of Turning Point USA, died at age 31 after he was shot in the neck from a nearby building during an outdoor speech on Wednesday at Utah Valley University. On Thursday, 22-year old Utah local Tyler Robinson was arrested for the shooting.

Chris Martin asked fans to send love to ‘people they disagree with but send them love anyway' #coldplaywembley #coldplay 


	While politicians and public figures on both sides of the aisle have condemned the act of political violence, many have called attention to Kirk's divisive public stances, which he advocated through his student organization Turning Point USA.


	President Donald Trump has since shared a statement, blaming the shooting on the “radical left,” adding: “This type of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.”


	“My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity, and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support, as well as those who go after our judges, law enforcement officials and everyone else who brings order to our country,” added Trump.

Didn't know it was possible to hate coldplay more than i already do.

Charliel Kirk's assassination has brought out the best in good people but the worst in bad people, and that's been a real eye opener for everyone.

I'm going to make a YouTube video, of all the deranged and cruel comments, Republicans have made when any Demoract has died, or has been physically assualted, in the last 8 years

He has the right to his opinion.  I also have the right to my opinion and boycott him.

Did you even read the article? Chris encouraged his audience to send love out into the world to anywhere they want, and gave a number of suggestions of where they could choose to send their love, one of which was to Charlie Kirk's family. What about that exactly is inspiring you to boycott him?

There were memorials for Charlie Kirk all over the country this past weekend because normal people who live in mainstream society have a conscience. So I don't think your boycott will matter much.

Kirk said he didn't like empathy. In this instance, I agree with him.

The average American didn't even know who Charlie Kirk was until they saw RIP messages on Facebook. I'm willing to bet a lot of this memorializing, especially by celebrities, is coming out of ignorance of what this man actually said and did, and is a kneejerk response to the tragic nature of the event. And the ones that aren't ignorant are purposefully trying to rewrite history to turn him into a martyr.

Yeah, it's a good thing Republicans didn't openly celebrate the murders of Melissa Hortman and her husband. And the murder of Heather Heyer. And the attempted murder of Paul Pelosi. And Biden's cancer diagnosis. Oh, wait…..

Hey I don't support what happened to Charlie Kirk but Charlie Kirk supported what happened to Charlie Kirk.

	Marking the 25th anniversary of her Oscar-nominated breakout performance in Almost Famous, Kate Hudson is reflecting on the iconic role of Penny Lane.


	The actress recently recalled that she originally “got the part for Anita,” who was ultimately played by Zooey Deschanel, and how she convinced writer/director Cameron Crowe to cast her as the leader of the rock & roll-supporting ‘Band-Aids'.


	“And then, Sarah Polley was supposed to play Penny Lane, and Brad Pitt was supposed to play Russell, and then, they fell through. And I was the only one cast,” Hudson told Entertainment Tonight. “I was like, ‘Cameron, can I please audition for Penny Lane?' And he didn't really want it at first. … And then like, four auditions later, finally he called me, and he was like, ‘You wanna be Penny Lane?' I was like, ‘Oh my god, Yes!'”

	The rest is history, as Hudson played the free-spirited music lover opposite Patrick Fugit‘s wide-eyed journalist William Miller, a character inspired by Crowe's own adolescence as a writer for Rolling Stone. Billy Crudup ended up cast as Russell Hammond, guitarist of Stillwater.


	Hudson added, “All of this was magic for me, because it completely changed my life. It changed the whole trajectory of my career.”


	The movie earned Hudson her first Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, also winning Best Film — Musical or Comedy. Crowe won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Fox News faces outrage for Brian Kilmeade ""involuntary lethal injection"" comment","https://www.avclub.com/fox-news-brian-kilmeade-involuntary-lethal-injection","Sun, 14 Sep 2025 01:17:00 GMT","

It's been a weird week for free speech in America, as the responses to the fatal shooting of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk on Wednesday have come in with a healthy dose of shock and awe attached. Cable news, obviously, has been the crucible for many of the emotions provoked by the violent attack on Kirk, with MSNBC wasting exactly zero seconds acceding to demands that it fire analyst Matthew Dowd for stating, when asked in the immediate aftermath of the shooting about the “environment” in which it took place, that “hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions.” Social media has filled up with reports of people collecting names and employers of those who expressed schadenfreude at Kirk's death, or suggested that he was anything less than the free-speech saint that his supporters and mourners have been portraying him as, while politicians, talk show hosts, and more have raced to be the first, or at least the loudest, to condemn all forms of political violence. (Even as folks like Elon Musk have continued to propagate calls to “fight back, or you die” to a quarter of a billion followers on social media.) Fox News has been at the forefront of this vocal outrage, rolling out guys like Sean Hannity to cluck his tongue at Illinois governor JB Pritzker suggesting that Donald Trump's rhetoric may have contributed to an American culture of political violence. They clearly feel the moral high ground is theirs.

Which does make it an extra kind of shocking to run into a clip like the one circulating online today from the September 10 episode of Fox And Friends—from the morning before Kirk was shot, while on a college campus in Utah—in which host Brian Kilmeade suggests that mentally ill homeless people who are unable, or unwilling, to accept help or treatment should be given “involuntary lethal injection, or something. Just kill 'em.” Kilmeade was talking with his co-hosts Lawrence Jones and Ainsley Earhardt about the death of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska, who was fatally stabbed on a train in North Carolina on August 22, with the main suspect in the case being a homeless man with a history of violent offenses. Jones was already going for a pretty hardline stance in his lead-up to Kilmeade's comment, suggesting that the “billions” spent on their care is wasted on those who won't accept it, and that they should either accept treatment or be thrown in jail. Which is when Kilmeade interjects with the “involuntary lethal injection” suggestion, provoking a quick “Yep” from Jones, and a quick change of topic from Earhardt.

Even amidst the furor surrounding Kirk's death, Kilmeade's comment has started to catch public attention; notably, California governor Gavin Newsom responded to the clip on Saturday morning with a quote from Proverbs, “Whoever closes his ear to the cry of the poor will himself call out and not be answered.” Per The Irish Star, Donald Whitehead, director of the National Coalition For The Homeless, called Kilmeade's on-air comment “Dangerous. It shows a lack of human compassion and it is really the worst possible time for that kind of language to be expressed.” Numerous voices, both online and from political leaders, have called for Kilmeade to face consequences for his comment; no word on what, if anything, Fox News plans to do in response.

Hunter Tylo last appeared as Dr. Taylor Hayes on “The Bold and the Beautiful” in 2019, but she is a rich part of the soap's enduring legacy. Longtime fans would still like to see the actress return to the role she called home on and off for nearly 30 years, but the chance of that is pretty unlikely. Rebecca Budig is currently recast as Taylor Hayes, and Tylo has other plans.

Years ago, the actress worked on a memoir, but couldn't speak as freely as she can now. Tylo made a recent appearance on “The Unexpected Cosmology Podcast” and teased her next project, a tell-all book!

Tylo's original book, “Making a Miracle,” was released by Simon & Schuster in 2000, when she was busy working on “The Bold and the Beautiful.” To protect those around her, she chose to leave many of her juicier stories out of the book. 

The actress made an appearance on “The Unexpected Cosmology” podcast and announced that she, along with the podcast host Noel Hadley, is working on a tell-all book.

Tylo explained, “I had to leave a lot of stuff out about things that were really going on there. I had to leave a lot of stuff out about what was going on in my marriage, things that were real-life problems. When you hear some of the stories that were in that book, then you hear what I was really dealing with on the set of The Bold and the Beautiful and the movie business in general, and my family life at home, now these stories will make sense to you.”

“This will be extremely detailed. The book that I'm writing will be more truthful. It will not be candy-coated, and it will not be there to glorify The Bold and the Beautiful. This is just going to be the real truth,” continues Tylo.

When asked about a potential title, the actress said that she is still working on it.

Hunter Tylo had a role on “Days of Our Lives” before finding her footing in daytime, as Dr. Taylor Hayes. She portrayed the Bold character on and off from 1990 to 2019. She was entangled in a front-burner love triangle storyline with Ronn Moss and Katherine Kelly Lang,.

Her character had three children, Thomas, Steffy, and Phoebe, who died in an accident.

Dr. Taylor Hayes has been recast twice since Tylo left. First, by Krista Allen, and she is currently played by Rebecca Budig.

And that's a wrap. After a nearly two-week frenzy of premieres, screenings, red carpets, parties, and some extremely tired journalists (ahem), this year's Toronto International Film Festival ends today. And, as usual, the annual fest ended both in style and with a pretty logical endpoint: a Sunday morning awards ceremony.

Right to it: This year's winner, and the first filmmaker to take home two People's Choice Awards, is Chloé Zhao for her “Hamnet.” (The filmmaker previously won in 2020 with her “Nomadland.”)

This year's ceremony included the presentation of a number of awards, from the much-anticipated People's Choice Award to a pair of brand-new accolades, the International People's Choice Award and Best Animated Short Film.

But it's the People's Choice Award that draws the most attention, particularly this early in the awards season (read: really early, but still ostensibly in it). Twelve of the last 15 People's Choice Award winners at TIFF went on to receive Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, and four of them (“The King's Speech,” “12 Years a Slave,” “Green Book,” and “Nomadland”) actually won the award. (Last year's winner, “The Life of Chuck,” was not released until this year.)

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






All feature films and series in TIFF's Official Selection are eligible for these awards, which are (as the name implies) chosen by the audience itself. The four audience-voted awards include the People's Choice Award, the People's Choice Documentary Award, the People's Choice Midnight Madness Award, and the brand-new International People's Choice Award. 

Today's ceremony also included the presentation of various juried awards, including the Platform Award, the Best Canadian Feature Film Award, the Best Canadian Discovery Award, the NETPAC Award, and the FIPRESCI Prize, along with three short film awards (Best International Short Film, Best Canadian Short Film, and new this year, Best Animated Short Film).

In 1997, Phish were jamming in a studio in Woodstock. Sequestered from the world, the quartet improvised for hours with the goal of finding some exciting bits to refine and embellish for its next studio album. Most of the material wound up on The Story of the Ghost, a funky, brittle album released just before Halloween the next year. But there was still some good stuff left over, so keyboardist Page McConnell took it upon himself to edit and compile it into a brief instrumental companion. They called it The Siket Disc, named after recording engineer John Siket, and released it directly to fans on their website in June 1999. An official release came via Elektra in November 2000. Only one song ever became a regular in their live sets, but the music found another purpose on tour, soundtracking the band's late-night drives in the van.

As far as facts go, that's all there is to it. There are nine jams, totaling just over 35 minutes altogether, culled from a period many fans recognize as the band's prime. If The Siket Disc simply offered the best of those jams—distinguished as “Type I” when they're following a song's general chord progression or “Type II” when they veer into spacier territory—it would likely still have something worth recommending. But something strange happened during these sessions in Woodstock. Distinct even from The Story of the Ghost, The Siket Disc is unlike anything in Phish's catalog. Compared to the buoyant highs they typically sought, these haunted, twilit valleys could feel like a photo negative of the band. It is the type of outlying statement that happens either with intense focus and vision or by accident: things the tape can't help but capture.

From their moments of blissful transcendence to their goofiest in-jokes, you get the sense that, if Phish knew where any of their ideas were leading, they would have no interest in pursuing them. Like a good first date, their music aims for a natural rhythm, making each step feel somehow easy and inevitable while still advancing the action. When he formed the band in 1983, guitarist Trey Anastasio blended this impulse with conceptual songwriting and intricate, theatrical music—cerebral gestures that drew influence from oddball iconoclasts like Frank Zappa and bookish prog bands like Genesis. As the band quickly carved out a distinct voice, he loosened up, and even his virtuosic guitar playing became a tool for unity. “I feel like I'm there to be an intermediary between music that's in the universe and the audience,” he told Guitar World in 1996. “It sounds silly, but I believe it more than I believe anything else in my life.”

That last sentence, as it happens, could be affixed to any of Phish's work in the 15 years leading up to The Siket Disc. While conventional wisdom (and reams of music criticism) might suggest otherwise, they had already covered quite a lot of ground as a studio act, and they worked hard to differentiate their official discography from the scratchy bootleg tapes that catalyzed their loyal following. Among its entries was a set of dazzlingly weird compositions played live in the studio (1989's Junta), a moody concept album that upped their emotional stakes (1993's Rift), a brash rock album tailor-made for alternative radio (1994's Hoist), and a tasteful, rootsy album that helped win over the jam skeptics (1996's Billy Breathes).

During their formative gigs for fellow college students in Vermont, the appeal of a Phish show was all about what happens next—where any given song might take them, what new tricks they might reveal, what would happen when other scenes discover this wild, ecstatic music. Like so many gifted kids chasing their passion, the band's boundless potential seemed to spur them on—even if the members seemed more interested in making each other laugh than singing in key or writing anything that might appeal to radio. As OG Phish head Tom Baggott recalls in Parke Puterbaugh's Phish: The Biography, “It was like there was a big joke going on and all the early Phish fans knew the punchline—which was that this was gonna be something big.”

Here is the dream of every small-town weirdo, as played out on the stages of the music industry: One day you will step to the front of the classroom and dazzle everyone, from the snobby cool kids to the stuffy professors who never thought you had it in you. And once you've won them over, there's no one left to please but yourself. With Phish, this posture was written so conclusively into their ascent that the trappings of mainstream success had little bearing on them. The major-label studio albums, no matter the effort and money behind them, would never hold fans' attention like the cherished bootleg tapes. And even as they started selling out storied halls like Madison Square Garden in 1994, they had their sights set elsewhere: specifically, five miles north in Plattsburgh, New York, where they launched their own two-day festival that became the largest North American concert of 1996.

It's an enviable place for any band—creating your own standards for success and finding an audience to achieve them with you—but it's also dangerous territory. It's one thing for the underdog to rise to the top of the class; it's another thing to have to run the school. These concerns informed Anastasio's 1988 college thesis, a heavily mythologized rock opera called The Man Who Stepped Into Yesterday. The plot, if I'm understanding it right (and I'm not sure I ever have), involves a utopian society called Gamehendge that becomes corrupted by power, then overthrown by a revolutionary, then eventually corrupted once again by that same revolutionary after he steps into power. Breaking onto the jam scene at a time when some heads saw the Grateful Dead in danger of burning and/or selling out, Anasatsio understood that good intentions and high ideals could only get you so far before real life starts to intrude.

Phish were feeling the pressure as they worked on The Story of the Ghost in 1997. Hoping to write more meaningful material to suit their new popularity, Anastasio arrived to the sessions with several songs he had co-written with lyricist Tom Marshall. His bandmates felt somewhat stifled by this idea. For one, because they had tried it before: hitting the studio with a batch of pre-written songs, only to watch them really take shape on the road. Secondly, this process seemed to reject the communal spirit that brought them together in the first place. Were they really just going to become Trey's backing band? Was he now… a frontman? Had we learned nothing from Gamehendge?

And so, they settled on a more comfortable method of jamming endlessly, searching for songs, and ensuring that, just like their stage lineup, no member of Phish would stand in front of the others. This is how The Story of the Ghost winds up being something of a disappointment—to Anastasio at least. The band was playing at its best; each member had a say in the direction; nobody got in each other's way. And this was exactly the problem. “The Story of the Ghost was our democratic album, our socialist album; if anyone didn't like a song it was out,” Anasatasio reflected to Guitar.com. “But what happens with that approach is the material gets watered down.” By the next record, 2000's Farmhouse, they returned to the previous approach, lost some of their spark, and made it back onto the album chart. Go figure.

Still, there were lessons to be learned. Part of The Siket Disc was inspired by a question someone asked Anastasio while at a Pavement show: “So how come every time you guys put an album out you do everything except what you do well?” It seems only natural that, if you're a band whose best moments arrive unplanned, you would find a creative process that channels the same chemistry. Accordingly, the strongest Phish studio albums, from the nascent playfulness of Junta to the lived-in hum of Sigma Oasis, seem to invite us in on the fun. These are records that make room for patient exploration and willfully irritating zaniness; music that might take a master's degree to annotate, with lyrics that could be written by middle schoolers goofing off in science class (and sometimes were).

I would argue this precise set of contradictions is what defines Phish to this day, what allowed them to evolve over the span of 40 years from an eccentric regional jam band to a classic rock institution. In oblique ways, these qualities are also what make The Siket Disc so fascinating, both an anomaly and an ideal gateway for new fans. The same way that someone put off by the gravelly triumph and saxed-up drama of the E Street Band might find sanctuary in the stark transmissions of Nebraska, I imagine even the most ardent skeptic could find moments of beauty on The Siket Disc—or at least admit, all right, that was a pretty cool guitar lick and at no point did I beg you to please make it stop.

All of this is without the magic trick that Phish typically reserves for their instrumental jams. It's the moment that Amanda Petrusich has described as the climax of so many Phish shows, when the jam hits the double digits and the music seems to sweep us away: “a short but delightful vacation from my corporeal self,” as she writes. Throughout The Siket Disc, Phish avoid these cosmic escapes, either by laying into nervous repetition as on “Insects” or incorporating eerie silence into “The Name Is Slick,” where you can almost see the members picking up their instruments, gazing around the room, and seeking reassurance that they're on the right track.

This type of trepidation was new for Phish, and I have sometimes heard it as an expression of the creeping anxieties that would eventually lead to their hiatus in 2004. You can sense this shift throughout Todd Phillips' 2000 documentary, Bittersweet Motel, which depicts their growing strain and bleary-eyed time out of mind on the road. In one memorable scene, Anastasio goes on a brief rant about bad reviews and unfavorable comparisons to the Dead. As a means of distinguishing his own perspective—“In eighth grade, I was in New Jersey, going to the mall, and listening to what was on at the mall”—he ends up making a case for his band's rightful place in the food chain. “The suburban white kid is part of history, whether you like it or not,” he declares. If so much of Phish's music demonstrated the very suburban instinct to rebel and explore and laugh off the shackles of mundanity, then The Siket Disc was surrender. When they closed their eyes and let their minds wander, these were the landscapes they saw: slow, still, circling the same familiar cul-de-sacs.

Even within its limited range, The Siket Disc exposes a different side of the band. They frequently abandon all signifiers of their traditional sound, as in the noise collage of “Fish Bass,” or rearrange familiar parts to find new dynamics, like the heavenly guitar-and-bass duet of “Albert.” You could attribute these shifts to McConnell's role as producer—he is a jazz aficionado, and there are times when the group seems to be channeling Miles Davis on his ambient jazz fusion record, In a Silent Way—or the fragmented nature of the recordings themselves. Many of the songs sit within the boundaries of one resounding chord, each member tugging to loosen its shape or finding ghostly overtones to cast around it. More often than not, the band seems to be attempting to imitate the sound of sputtering car wheels stuck in the snow.

The centerpiece, and the song they've returned to the most on stage, is “What's the Use.” I would hail it as the most beautiful in-studio Phish performance, using each second of its 11:20 runtime to communicate a single emotion. From the moment it rises like a plane taking off from a sleepy runway to the steady fadeout into tape hiss, I'm not sure any song has so specifically conjured the feeling of pressing onward through exhaustion. In the decades since its release, The Siket Disc is the only Phish record to appropriately assume the genre descriptors of post-rock and ambient, and this song shows you how it might slot alongside contemporaneous releases from Thrill Jockey or Kranky.

“What's the Use” requires each band member to make it land: John Fishman's heavenly, waltz-time drumbeat; Gordon's crystalline bassline; McConnell's descending lullaby of a keyboard refrain, reserved for maximum impact just after the seven-minute mark. And yet, it also features the sole moment on the record that belongs exclusively to Anastasio. His extraordinary guitar solo seems to span the entire track, ascending the fretboard, never dissolving into pure noise but always in danger of being enveloped by feedback. As he reaches the highest note, he signals the rest of the band to cool off. It feels little like a cry for help, a distant siren fading in the night.

“Often there is a moment when it feels like the safety rails fall off,” Anastasio told The New Yorker of his favorite jams. “We lose any sense of time passing. Then I feel safe letting people see how I actually feel, which is terrified a lot of the time.” After all these years, it makes sense he feels most comfortable expressing this vulnerability in the adrenaline-fueled, communal peaks of a rock show. Sometimes I think about those peaks as literal heights, places we can only reach with the momentum and confidence that comes when a lot of people are gathered together, aiming our sights at the same slow-forming horizon. If that's what you're looking for in art, then Phish has made plenty of music to take you there. But this time, they were just four musicians in a studio, trying to write an album, taking momentary comfort in the lonesome, weary sound of going nowhere.

The Sopranos is the most influential scripted TV show of this century, and only I Love Lucy and The Twilight Zone have a better argument for the top spot overall. The drama, starring the late James Gandolfini as a New Jersey Mob boss whose family and Family are equally hazardous to his health, has been endlessly celebrated, imitated, and quoted, to the point where even many people who haven't seen it feel like they have. But even if you've watched it, how well do you really know the finer points of life in Essex County? Let's put your knowledge to the test.

Take Our Survey












Zero to 30% correct: Ohhhh! You're a civilian neighbor like Dr. Bruce Cusamano. You're aware of Tony Soprano and his work, but don't know too much about the inner workings of the Family, and your favorite Italian restaurant might be Olive Garden. We would strongly recommend sitting down as soon as possible to binge the entire series, preferably with a book that offers a helpful episode-by-episode guide to your journey, as well as a large plate of capicola — or, as Tony and friends say it, “gabagool.”

31 to 60% correct: You did not disrespect the pizza parlor! You're at least a Family associate, possibly in consideration for soldier. You've seen most if not all of the episodes, but probably only once each. So we would recommend another binge. (And when you're done, that book also has deep-dive conversations with Sopranos creator David Chase.)

	











61 to 100% correct: Quasimodo predicted that you're a made guy, possibly even a capo. You get to play cards in the back room at the pork store. You get seated immediately when you show up at Vesuvio. Everyone at the Bada Bing refers to you by name when you enter. You can probably even name all the songs on the jukebox at Holsten's, and point out plot discrepancies between the series and its prequel film, The Many Saints of Newark.

	Utah Governor Spencer Cox said that the alleged shooter in the killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk is “not cooperating” with authorities while in custody.


	“He has not confessed to authorities. He is not cooperating, but, all the people around him are cooperating. And I think that's very important,” Cox said Sunday on ABC's This Week.


	Authorities arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson last week in connection with the shooting after his father confronted him with images of the alleged shooter. 


	“Tyler, is this you? This looks like you,” Robinson's father asked his son, CNN reported, citing a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. Robinson, with his father's encouragement, later turned himself in to police on Thursday night.


	Cox said that formal charges will be filed against Robinson on Tuesday.

	Asked about reporting by The New York Times that said Robinson exchanged messages with friends on Discord joking about being the alleged shooter after the event.

	











	“All we can confirm is that those conversations definitely were happening, and they did not believe it was actually him. It was, it was all joking until, until he, you know, until he admitted that it actually was him,” he said.


	According to the Times, Robinson joked that his “doppelganger” was responsible for the shooting.


	Appearing on CNN's State of the Nation, Cox addressed questions about Robinson's roommate.


	“Some outlets are reporting that the suspect lived with a transgender partner. Is that accurate? And are investigators looking at this part of his life as a possible motivation?” Dana Bash asked Cox.

	











	“I can confirm that. I know that has been reported and that the FBI has confirmed that as well, that the roommate was a romantic partner, a male transitioning to female,” Cox said.


	“I can say that he has been very cooperative,” Cox continued, possibly misgendering the roommate. “This partner has been incredibly cooperative, had no idea that this was happening and is working with investigators right now.”

	On NBC, Cox added that the roommate “was shocked when they found out about it.”


	But when Bash again brought up whether the two were romantically involved, the governor seemed to say that is not confirmed yet: “We're trying to figure it out. I know everybody wants to know exactly why and point the finger, and I totally get that. I do, too.”


	Cox told The Wall Street Journal earlier the shooter was “deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology.” When Martha Raddatz asked Cox specifically about that comment on Sunday, the governor said that information “has come from his acquaintances and his family members.”

Utah. Gov. Spencer Cox told @MarthaRaddatz that acquittances and family members of Tyler Robinson have indicated he was “deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology,” but said more information will be included in the charging documents against him. https://t.co/e2j30BKSjI pic.twitter.com/z6RuUGYC64


	Back on CNN, Cox — who last week after Robinson's arrest that he had been “praying” that the shooter was “somebody [who] drove from another state, somebody [who] came from another country” — said, “I really don't have a dog in this fight. If this was MAGA and a radicalized MAGA person, I would be saying that as well. If the friends were saying that, I would be sharing that as well. That's not what they're sharing.”


	When pressed for specifics about what Robinson said about Kirk to his family, Cox said, “Just not a fan. That's all I can say.”

	Many on the right, including Donald Trump and Cox, have been quick to blame the left for Kirk's shooting. 


	Asked for his reaction to Trump's comments blaming the left, Cox said, “Well, look, President Trump is very angry. And Charlie is his close personal friend. There is a lot of anger — a lot of anger on the right, on my side of the aisle. And I've certainly felt that. And in this case, it does appear that that's true. Again, more information is coming, and we'll learn more over time. You know, I don't know that that matters as much as the radicalization piece. I brought up the Democrats who were assassinated recently and how quickly we move on from these things. But the body count is piling up. And so, I'm so concerned about this radicalization piece. And that's what we're trying to understand.”

RADDATZ: You talked about Democrats who have been targeted. Trump said nothing about the political violence against Democrats. In fact, he blamed the radical left. What's your reaction to that?SPENCER COX: Well look, President Trump is very angry.


	“We also have to figure out how it came to be that a kid with a 4.0, with a 34 on the ACT, with a full-ride scholarship at my alma mater, who didn't even last a semester, drops out and ends up doing something like this,” Cox concluded. “We need to understand that, and we need to figure out how to stop it.”

	











	Robinson did not register as affiliated with any political party, and his voter records show him as “inactive,” the Times reported, meaning he did not vote in the 2024 presidential election. The real answer about what Robinson believed when he shot Kirk may be far more complex than left or right.

Foo Fighters performed with new drummer Ilan Rubin for the first time Saturday night at their first show of 2025, in San Luis Obispo, California's 900-capacity Fremont Theater. Rubin, formerly of Nine Inch Nails, joined the band this summer after the Foos parted ways with Josh Freese, who had stepped in after the 2022 death of longtime drummer Taylor Hawkins.


	At one point, frontman Dave Grohl introduced Rubin from the stage. “Everybody else has said it,” Grohl said. “I finally get the opportunity to say, ‘Ladies and gentlemen, will you please welcome…' The most badass motherfucker, Ilan Rubin, is playing drums in the Foo Fighters right now. It's official. You can stamp the passport.”


	The surprise performance, announced the day before, featured 25 songs in all, including hits like “Everlong” and “Learn to Fly,” and a handful of tracks that haven't been played live in several years.  Among them was “Exhausted,” from the Foos' first album, which Grohl wrote while he was still in Nirvana and even played for Kurt Cobain as a potential song for that band. They also played “Winnebago,” another Grohl composition that preceded the existence of the Foos.

I
t was after 3 a.m. on Nov. 6 last year, and nobody on the planet was happier than a balding, slender man standing near the reception desk of the Hilton West Palm Beach.


Donald Trump had just finished hosting his 2024 election watch party at the adjacent Florida convention center, declaring victory in a speech eloquently touting “the most incredible political thing.” Jubilant Republican donors, campaign staff, future government officials, and attendees (of course, Jon Voight) flooded over to the luxury hotel to celebrate.


	At the front of the lobby stood Stephen Miller, the man Trump would soon tap as his White House's undisputed orchestrator of policies and executive authority.


	Miller had been one of the first Trump administration's key policy drivers, particularly when it came to the president's throttling of legal immigration. Senior officials in President Joe Biden's administration will tell you the country is still living with the damage Miller did to immigration during Trump's first term, and that the Biden team was unable, or unwilling, to undo much of it with their four years in power.

	











	But that night in Florida, something was different for the then-39-year-old Miller. A universe of possibilities was unfurling before him.


	Amid the revelry, Miller huddled with other high-ranking Trump personnel and said his thank you's to the ad hoc procession of euphoric conservative voters and GOP bigwigs who congratulated him over and over. They all could see it wasn't just Trump's victory that night — it was Miller's, and many felt obliged to kiss his Trump-endowed ring.

	











	To see the expression of unbridled joy written across Miller's face at that moment of Trump's restoration was to stare into the eyes of someone who could see the future: Trump's top adviser, his most faithful believer, the one close aide who had somehow survived the countless purges of MAGA officials in the first term, knew the country was now his.


	Speaking to one overjoyed woman, Miller said, “It's gonna be great.”

	More than seven months into Trump's second term, Stephen Miller has become America's — if not the world's — most powerful unelected bureaucrat. With Trump's blessing, Miller has been allowed to run and remake the country in a manner virtually unheard of for a U.S. government official of his rank. Think of any egregious policy from the Trump administration: Chances are, it was driven by Stephen Miller.


	All of it bears Trump's signature, but the president is not the one spending his nights writing executive orders and bending legal theory to his will; nearly all of this bears the authorship (or, at least, co-authorship) of Miller. Everything you loathe or love about Donald Trump's America, you hate or cherish about Stephen Miller's republic of fear.


	Under Miller's guiding hand, the government can deport (or kidnap and rendition) you or your spouse, without due process, to a foreign gulag, if the president feels like it. The White House can repeatedly threaten to take away the most basic of constitutional protections, such as habeas corpus. The president can launch Justice Department criminal investigations against his enemies who, by all known accounts, did nothing wrong except annoy the commander-in-chief, or refuse to help him steal an election. The president and his lieutenants can arrest you at a routine courthouse check-in, at your church, outside your kid's school, even if you have no criminal record. They've instituted a heavily draconian system of immigration arrest “quotas,” ensuring a regime not mainly of mass deportation, but of mass disappearances and indefinite detention in jails and newly erected camps.

	They've quickly turned much of federal law enforcement into the masked, nameless, unaccountable secret police, working at the whims of the president and his staff. The president can deploy armed National Guard troops, and even U.S. Marines, to the streets of an American city any time he wants — and deem it enemy territory. The administration has made censoring media organizations, comedians, and aging rock stars a policy priority, in an anti-free-speech crusade waged from the West Wing to the Federal Communications Commission.

	











“Shadow Sec Def.”


“Prime Minister Miller.”


“The REAL Attorney General.”


“The DHS boss.”


“President Miller.”


	Trump administration officials and other Republicans close to the president and this White House are paranoid that Miller will one day hear them gossiping about him behind his back — but they still whisper the unofficial titles and nicknames that they bestow onto the White House deputy chief of staff.


	When Rolling Stone asks one senior administration official about former Fox News star and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, this source says, unprompted, that “he does what Stephen wants him to do.”


	As a teenager in Santa Monica, California, Miller craved nothing more than triggering the good-looking kids in school who wanted nothing to do with him.


	Jason Islas, who first met Miller at Lincoln Middle School in Santa Monica, says he and Miller and a third friend were a tight-knit band of outsiders who spent middle school doing preteen-boy stuff, like talking about Star Trek (Islas remembers Miller as a big Captain Kirk fan). That all changed, though, in the summer of 1999, between eighth and ninth grades, when, Islas says, Miller informed him they couldn't be friends anymore. “One of the things he did say was that he didn't like the fact that I'm of Latin heritage,” Islas recalls.


	In the decades that followed, Miller did not grow — except to become more hardened in his extremist views. When he worked as a communications aide in the office of Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions during the Obama years, he was so widely disliked by his conservative colleagues on Capitol Hill that Republican staff in other offices would invent or spread malicious rumors about Miller, such as that he liked to play with porcelain dolls. (A White House official insists that any such characterization of his time on the Hill is “inaccurate and baseless gossip.”) The staffers at the time never dreamed that he'd ever amount to much more than a punch line or an obscure cautionary tale of what happens when you read too many far-right hate websites and dive into Washington's most feverish swamps.


	Even today, not much has changed. As the president's policy architect and enforcer, he is obsessed, according to three Trump advisers, with deploying the might of the government to stamp out what he deems “anti-white hatred” and “anti-white racism” and “anti-white discrimination” — no matter the cost.

	











	Miller speaks almost exclusively in apocalyptic terms, in the caricatured language of military combat, forever war, and invasion against the culture and the homeland.


	He's yearned to erect a vast hyper-militarized network of what he's dubbed “camps” for detention and mass deportation — a network he hopes will change the American political and physical landscape forever.


	Miller, who is Jewish, has been denounced by his own uncle as a one-man betrayal of Jewish moral and political values. Miller has long held the deepest admiration for the Immigration Act of 1924, and wishes to bring America back to those days. The law is notorious for making the Holocaust deadlier for Jews who tried to flee the Nazis, only to be denied safe passage to the U.S.


	Immediately after election night 2024 was called, human rights groups and pro-immigration advocates could not help but consider that they were not prepared for the onrush that Miller was about to unleash. Of all of the Trump appointees, he was the one who kept them up at night. For all of incoming Trump “border czar” Tom Homan's big talk on mass deportations, he was nothing compared to Miller. To those familiar with Homan's work, the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) could recognize, occasionally, that there were some rules and restrictions, here and there. For a guy like Miller, the only laws that mattered were the ones he and Trump could pervert.


	Miller may be the avatar of the anonymous racist internet troll brought to agonizing life and imbued with power. But that does not mean he doesn't thoroughly believe in the righteousness of the ideology he's selling. In his mind, he's the triumphant hero — a one-man antidote to effete liberalism, and a holy warrior against the permissive legal and illegal immigration that has left him and his peers feeling mugged by pluralistic reality.


	Talk to Republicans operating at the highest levels of Trumpville and you get a unique mix of admiration and unease when you ask them what they think about Miller. “One intense motherfucker,” a longtime Trump adviser notes.


	Even attempts by his friends to make him sound gentler, kinder, or funnier often fall flat, making him seem like a crank or the meanest dork you've ever met. For instance, multiple longtime Miller associates say that the top White House aide is one of the most “MAHA” people you'll ever meet, and has plunged headlong into Robert F. Kennedy Jr.-style food and health (or anti-health) agitprop. Accounts of his social life make him sound, to put it gently, tedious.

	











	One conversational victim of his recounts to Rolling Stone what it was like to get hit on by a premarital Miller, circa 2017, at a bar not far from Dupont Circle. The story involves being grilled about which country was named on the collar of her clothing (don't say China), and getting accused of being a “globalist” because she wasn't the right kind of conservative.


	Female strangers aren't the only ones in Washington who think he's weird. Over the years of their close working relationship, President Trump — ever the gossipy Mean Girl with a nuclear arsenal — has not shied away from insulting Miller behind his back. According to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter, Trump has commented to others in the past about Miller's intense, awkward, and at times off-putting demeanor.


	But to Trump, Miller is a useful battering ram, the policy answer to his lingering question of “Where's my Roy Cohn?”


	“Stephen Miller has been one of President Trump's longest serving and most trusted advisers for nearly a decade, and I can personally attest to the respect the president has for Stephen because I witness it every day,” says White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. “That's why Stephen serves as the deputy chief of staff for policy and Homeland Security adviser, because the president has the utmost faith in him and his proven leadership abilities. In addition to being extremely effective at his jobs, Stephen is a loyal colleague and friend. Any suggestion otherwise is false gossip from people who don't actually know him.”


	In addition to the press secretary's statement, the Trump White House sent Rolling Stone a lengthy list of testimonials — resembling an extremely MAGA LinkedIn endorsements section — from Republican lawmakers to prove that people like Stephen Miller personally. 


	Sen. Josh Hawley, for instance, says he's glad to call Miller “a friend,” adding that “he cares deeply about helping create a future where American families can thrive.”


	“Stephen Miller is bright, thoughtful, takes the time to listen to our members and their concerns, and has always been easy to work with,” says House Majority Leader Rep. Steve Scalise, adding: “I am proud to call Stephen Miller a close friend.”


	The White House provided similar statements from Sen. Tom Cotton, Sen. Mike Lee, and Rep. Jim Jordan, with a spokesperson saying they expected that all of the lawmakers' praise for Miller would be included in this story.

	











	Nowadays, according to various sources working in and close to the Trump West Wing, the president's lieutenant is technically a deputy White House chief of staff, but he far outpaces the actual White House chief of staff — Trump's former 2024 campaign co-chief Susie Wiles — as Trump's primary chief of administration policy.


	Miller touches virtually every policy and executive action (especially as it relates to domestic initiatives), effectively all documents, Trump directives, constitutionally dubious orders, and memos. The architecture of Trump's military crackdowns (in Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and coming to a Democratic-dominant city near you) is in part a product of Miller's vision for dominating liberal strongholds he despises.


	“It's a blast for Stephen,” says another fellow Trump adviser, in describing Miller's role in orchestrating the domestic deployments of U.S. armed forces.


	The Trump administration's sweeping clampdown on diversity programs, higher education, and free speech Trump does not care for is a direct expression of Miller's ethos, bringing to life a long-held ambition of federalizing the conservative “culture war” in ways once thought uncouth. Trump's sprawling immigration and border enforcement is just “The Stephen Miller Show,” brought to you by Stephen Miller Productions LLC, and personally stage-managed by Stephen Miller.


	With each shred of paper that the president will sign to launch these domestic programs, the Trump lieutenant peruses it, sometimes marks it up with edits, and pushes other Trump officials across the federal apparatus to, in his words, “get it done.”


	His berating of intra-departmental and agency officials has become the stuff of legend, if not waking nightmares. Since the beginning of the second Trump administration, two sources who've worked in the federal government and have personally dealt with Miller tell Rolling Stone that his berating has made them each cry at work.


	During intra-agency discussions, Miller has routinely name-called, yelled, threatened officials' jobs or future in the party, and attempted to humiliate people in front of their colleagues. He becomes enraged if he feels the immigrant-arrest numbers aren't padded enough, or if he believes Trump's domestic agenda is being stalled, even slightly. He is known for working long hours and micromanaging the brutal policies coming out of the new administration. He has a longstanding reputation, dating back to 2017, in the Republican upper ranks as someone willing to say anything, do anything, and betray almost anyone, in the service of Trump and, more vitally, keeping his power and proximity to the president intact.

	











	Within the highest levels of the Trump administration, the idea that Attorney General Pam Bondi runs the Justice Department or that Kristi Noem runs the Department of Homeland Security is woefully incomplete. Nominally independent departments are run by the West Wing of the White House — and therefore, largely, by Miller.


	When some government personnel would note that Trump can deploy National Guard troops and armed U.S. Marines to Democratic-run urban areas, but that the troops can't conduct traditional law enforcement, per se, Miller was the one telling administration lawyers and staff that Trump wanted them to figure out ways around that legal inconvenience, and to report back with whatever legal theories they'd produce.


	Miller has made it a top priority for the opening months of this Trump term to normalize the deployment of U.S. troops on American soil — not for states of emergency, but for domestic political purposes. According to those who've spoken with them about it, Trump and Miller view those who object as “weak,” “cowards,” and “pro-crime.”


	In the aftermath of Trump's deployment of the National Guard and U.S. Marines to assist with ICE operations in Los Angeles, Miller insisted that purging undocumented migrants from the city would create a utopia for the remaining residents.


	“You have any idea how many resources will be opened up for Americans when the illegals are gone?” Miller told Fox News. “No more waiting in line at an emergency room, no more massive traffic in Los Angeles. Your health insurance premiums go down, your public-school classroom size will shrink … and if you do need to get support from the government, you're not going to be in line behind millions of illegal aliens from the third world. This is going to be such a gift to the quality of life of everyday Americans.”


	In July, when speaking to the press pool in front of the White House, Miller was asked if it was the best use of the administration's resources to be going after “moms with young kids.” In return, he grilled the reporter on what percentage of undocumented migrants should be allowed to stay. “Do you think we have some sort of Magic 8 Ball to see which particular illegal aliens … are going to go on to commit a rape or murder?”


	Miller has no legal background, but according to Trump officials, Miller was the mastermind behind Trump's ploy to use the Alien Enemies Act to conduct mass deportations without due process, a plot he detailed in 2023 during an interview with conservative radio hosts Clay Travis and Buck Sexton.

	











	Miller was also the first member of the administration to publicly suggest the suspension of habeas corpus, the core constitutional right of protection from arbitrary detention by the state. Speaking to reporters at the White House in May, Miller said, “The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended in a time of invasion, so I would say that is an option we're actively looking at.” There is, of course, no invasion.


	For those who want to grasp the true nature of Miller's legacy and his role in our world, you have to look far beyond 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. To understand Trump's principal enforcer, you need to understand what he is doing to countless people, all over the country — and then you'd have to understand his personal, instinctive response when he hears about the stories of his victims.


	Across the country there are thousands of families ripped apart by the Trump-Miller gang, and most of those stories you won't read about or may never hear about. One of these was relayed earlier this year to Rolling Stone by an Ohio-based immigration lawyer. This magazine verified details of this account, and agreed to use pseudonyms for the wife, husband, and three-year-old daughter. The lawyer asked not to be identified, due to Miller's and the Trump administration's zeal for targeting pro bono immigration attorneys.


	In 2020, “Richard” (as we'll call him) fled his Latin American home country to seek asylum in the U.S. As Richard will tell you, he had served in the military in his home country, but had grown fearful of what might happen to him if he remained, citing corruption and powerful organized crime.


	By 2025, he had already made a life for himself in the United States. He had a wife — “Ellen” — and a small daughter, “Jessica,” and they were living in Columbus, Ohio. He worked to support the family, and Ellen stayed home with Jessica. There is no known history of petty or violent crime or any criminal record between them. However, in early 2024, the couple showed up for one of their scheduled hearings and left without actually attending it, but only because somebody at the check-in desk erroneously told them they were not on the schedule that day. That one mishap — which by all accounts, was not their fault — was enough to doom their family under Trump's second administration.


	This past June, Richard received a text message from ICE asking that he appear for a check-in at the local ICE office. Due to the Trump administration's barrage of new policies and arrest quotas pushed by Miller and Trump, his lawyer was suspicious. Still, Richard had faith in this great country. He wanted to show he was no criminal, that he wanted to come here the right way, and that he had nothing to hide.

	











	The Ohio-based attorney met the family of three at the federal check-in outside of Columbus, with all of them waiting in line to get into the building. Jessica and Ellen were wearing matching attire — Jessica's hair in pigtails with ribbons, wearing a pink dress. The lawyer recalls the daughter and father laughing as Jessica played with her dad's cheeks, which he blew up as if to mimic a puffer fish.


	After they passed the waiting area, two armed ICE officers would soon flank them, and one of them told the attorney and the family that the officers had no choice. ICE had its directive “from Washington,” the officer said, which had been issued after Trump's inauguration in January — new standards and demands for higher arrest and deportation numbers (regardless of any existing criminal record) that were directly authored by Miller.


	The officer said they had to put the father in handcuffs right then and there, and take him away. “We just have to follow orders,” the ICE officer said.


	At first, the Spanish-speaking family did not know what was happening. The lawyer had to translate all of this, back and forth, as the couple and their legal representative pleaded with the ICE officers to allow them to self-deport as a family. Surely doing so would save the American taxpayer money.


	The ICE officer apologized. There was nothing anyone, apparently, could do.


	The officers were courteous enough to offer to allow Ellen and Jessica to leave the room, so the child did not have to see them handcuffing her dad. The father squatted low to pick up Jessica and hug her goodbye. Jessica, confused and sobbing, would not let go, wrapping her arms around her father's neck and her legs around his body.


	One of the two ICE officers informed the family they needed to get things moving along, just as Ellen had her hands around Jessica's waist, unable — at first — to pry the preschool-age girl off her dad. One ICE officer had his hand on the father's shoulder, while the other officer hovered over the family.


	“Daddy!” the girl screamed in Spanish. “I want Daddy! I want my daddy!”


	Ellen was finally able to remove a hysterical Jessica from the room, and as the ICE officers took Richard, she kept yelling, “Daddy, Daddy, Noooooooooo!!!!” As they walked back to the waiting room, the lawyer could see the faces of the immigrants and others who were sitting in the waiting area, looking on in confused horror at what must have been waiting for them on the other side of that door. Months later, the attorney tells Rolling Stone, “I can still hear the little girl's screams.”

	











	Ellen and Jessica would pack up and leave for Richard's home country. The two expected to reunite with him there within days. Instead, to their terror, the Trump administration disappeared him into a Louisiana detention facility for nearly two months. They have since been reunited, but the scars have yet to heal. The lawyer says that Jessica still wakes up in the middle of the night, shouting for “Daddy.”

	Under every modern president there is harsh immigration enforcement, and heartbreaking decisions are made. But this story is only happening because the Trump White House and Miller are leaning on agencies to crack down in every state, just so Miller can run up the scoreboard on arrests.


	To you, this may seem sad, even appalling. To Miller, he thinks your outrage is very funny. In private conversations this year, the top Trump adviser has said that liberals promoting immigrant families' “sob stories” are engaging in emotional “blackmail” that Miller and the government simply will not fall for. He laughs it off, before getting back to work creating more horror stories.

	The bad omens came early at this year's Burning Man — the infamously wild, weeklong celebration of art, music, and unrestrained self-expression held at the end of every summer in Nevada's Black Rock Desert — portending a particularly extra-ordinary burn.


	During the first weekend of the 10-day event, when thousands of early burners were undertaking the formidable task of raising a fully functional city of roughly 80,000 citizens from a barren alkali flat in the wilderness 100 miles north of Reno, powerful gales leveled many of the city's temporary structures, or prevented them from being built at all. When the wind finally let up on Sunday and the gates officially opened, burners began pouring into the city just as hammering rain began. The deluge repeated Monday and Tuesday, drenching the ordinarily waterless environment. “The playa was a lake,” says burner Erin Kindt, who describes mud that made the city's desert-dust roads almost unwalkable and entirely undriveable. Those already inside the gate stayed close to camp out of necessity, while those still outside were stuck in their vehicles — some for up to 20 hours — in the infamous one-lane traffic jam into Black Rock City (BRC).

	











	On Wednesday, the weather finally took a turn for the better, as the winds died down and the playa dried up. As if to providentially underline the metaphor of renewal and rebirth, a Salt Lake City woman at her first Burning Man started the day with inexplicable abdominal pains and finished it with a surprise: a healthy baby daughter born in her RV. Stirred by the resurgent spirit, and a sense of urgency, having “lost” a few days of the Burning Man they'd expected, the citizens of BRC began to party with a vengeance. “The rain finally stopped, and everyone finally landed,” Kindt says. “It turned into a wild, crazy, frantic party, with sunsets and sunrises full of people raging to make the most of what Burning Man days we had left.”

	The frenetic energy carried on into Saturday night, the climax of the week, the event whence Burning Man gets its name, when the entire city gathers to watch a towering effigy go up in flames. But as fireworks illuminated the desert sky, and fire engulfed the figure, at least one BRC citizen was not present: Vadim Kruglov. While the rest of Burning Man celebrated, Kruglov lay prostrate on the ground at a faraway campsite in a comparatively desolate section of Black Rock City, his throat slashed, as a puddle of blood congealed around his lifeless body.

	What exactly happened and why remain stubborn mysteries for the moment, and we may never learn the full picture of what transpired. The investigation is ongoing, and it's unclear what progress has been made toward apprehending a suspect. The Pershing County Sheriff's Dept. declined to confirm to Rolling Stone if any suspects had been identified, or make any statement at all beyond its press releases. Organizers of the event also declined to comment past their existing public statements. “Burning Man Project is doing everything we can to assist the Sheriff's investigation so the perpetrator can be caught and brought to justice,” the organizers said. “This includes our intent for a coordinated donation to the Secret Witness program, which offers rewards for more information that contributes to law enforcement's investigation.” The investigation has been hampered by peculiar challenges, though, perhaps none greater than the fact that the entire city in which the crime occurred has vanished.


	If confirmed as such, Kruglov's will be the only murder to happen in Black Rock City in its three and a half decades of existence. Death and tragedy are, unfortunately, rare but regular parts of Burning Man, and violence is not completely absent. In 2024, two people were arrested on charges of assault with a deadly weapon, and three more on battery charges. Sexual assault is, unfortunately, an issue the Burning Man community is forced to deal with every year. But violence of this kind — murder — is unheard of in Black Rock City.

	Burning Man is dangerous — that's part of the challenge, and, as I've found over the course of nearly half a dozen burns, part of the allure. Dehydration, heat stroke, bike wrecks, a bad trip; these are just a few of the hazards a burner may face in Black Rock City. But there's a social contract underpinning that danger that says that burners look out for one another. Part of the reason at Burning Man you can to lose your friends and get lost in a whiteout and have a grand adventure with strangers that ends with you sleeping in the cuddle puddle at a camp you've never heard of is because there's a level of trust and regard for everyone's safety built into the culture. Safety isn't a burner's top concern, or even the second most important, but it's up there: “Safety third!” as burners are fond of saying. An act of violence so heinous as that which took Kruglov's life marks a sharp break in that social contract unlike many, or any, other transgressions could.

	











	Though I was unable to go to Burning Man this year, I learned through conversations with friends and my reporting that the impact of the homicide was felt almost immediately. When the news first spread through the Burning Man rumor mill, the first reaction seemed to be confusion — rumors there are supposed to be about whether Daft Punk is playing at the trash fence or a major art piece burn has been rescheduled, not a grisly death. But in the aftermath of the tragedy, some burners are looking back on that last weekend of the celebration with anxiety and even fear. The lingering effects of an incident so vile occurring within Burning man's sweet bubble are bound to affect people for a long time.


	BLACK ROCK CITY IS LAID OUT in a grid shaped like a horseshoe, with the eponymous Man at its center. There's a large section of BRC near the top of the curve called “open camping” where space is allotted on a first-come-first-serve basis, rather than through lots assigned in advance, as in the rest of BRC. The free-for-all results in a neighborhood with a more disordered, organic layout than elsewhere in town. It's also relatively quiet compared to further down near the Man. The long streets that run the length of the shoe are each given a letter A through L, while the shorter streets that cut across the width are assigned numbers like in a clock, from 2:00 to 10:00. The tent in which Krulgov's body was found was located near 8:30 & I, in open camping.


	Kruglov, 37, was a Russian citizen born and raised in Omsk, a city of one million in southwestern Siberia. He moved to the United States in 2016 and, according to authorities, had made a home in Washington State. Though Kruglov studied engineering and worked in IT, he was an artist too. “He wanted to give love,” Kruglov's friend and collaborator Roman Lurye reportedly told a Russian-language news site. This was Kruglov's first burn and he leapt into Burning Man with a heedless passion rare among first-time burners. According to an Instagram post from his friend Sofiia Shcherbakova, he spearheaded his camp's art project on the playa, and even came in early to help put the city together. The effusively loving affect that his friends' describe is reflected in the sculpture he installed on the playa — slats of gold and white splayed out like a headdress, framing a heart with a mirror inside. In an Instagram caption (translated from Russian) posted within a day or so of Kruglov's death, Lurye referred to the piece as “a big heart . . . that seems to have taken these wounds, made them part of art and closed the circle of experience.”

	











	When he first heard the news of a homicide at Burning Man, on Saturday night after the Man Burn, longtime burner Tim LaVelle was dancing to DJ CRSTO De La Selva at the PlayAlchemist camp, whose pyramid is a prominent feature of the BRC skyline. “A little after midnight, I distinctly remember overhearing the word ‘homicide,'” LaVelle says. “It ran right through that pyramid like an electric current and everybody was tuned into it. But I think everybody thought, ‘There's no way this is real.' It wasn't until the next morning that it really hit home.”


	THE LAST BIG EVENT OF BURNING MAN is not yet another bacchanalia, but the immolation on Sunday at sundown of the Temple, an important and always appropriately ornate structure on the playa, which burners visit to pray, meditate, and reflect. When fire consumes the Temple it seals that year's burn with a tinge of solemnity. This year, however, for the people camped near 8:30 and I, Sunday night was also permeated by another set of far less welcome emotions: anxiety and fear.


	There are not many taboos at Burning Man, so those that persist at the otherwise staunchly anarchic event do so for a reason. It is forbidden, for example, to discard garbage on the ground — even debris as seemingly harmless as cigarette ash — due to the event's “leave no trace” ethos. And it is generally frowned upon to ask other burners for water. Radical self-reliance is a key tenet of Burning Man. Though on occasion even an experienced burner may run out and depend on fellow revelers in a pinch, if someone is going around Burning Man asking for water it's an indication that something has gone very wrong.  


	Thus, when two disheveled men barged into one camp on Sunday, the burners who encountered the thirsty strangers were understandably uneasy. Though it was not yet clear that there had been a homicide the night before, they'd heard about the death of a then-unidentified burner and there had been a notable and ongoing police presence in their neighborhood from Saturday night on. It was enough to raise the anxiety level in camp, which the addition of two sketchy strangers — completely innocent though they might have been — certainly did not help. “[They were] definitely off-putting characters that we didn't want hanging around our camp, who seemed like a liability and like somebody we wanted to have distance from us,” says one long-time burner who asked to remain anonymous.

	











	It was late in the afternoon when two middle-aged men, both around six feet tall, one Black and one white, arrived at their camp, the burners say. The interaction felt off from the start. The men entered not from the street but from the side, through parked cars and neighboring camps. The white one with scraggly, shoulder-length hair skipped pleasantries and asked with patent urgency for water. He didn't have a vessel so the burners gifted him a jug, but he continued to linger. The Black one wore skinny jeans and sunglasses, which he kept urging the campers to try on. He casually mentioned that he'd been in a fight earlier; he'd been jumped by a group of guys, he said, and had to defend himself. Uninvited, he took a seat on the couch to try ham-fisted pickup lines on one of the women, though he was too out of it to carry on a conversation. “Do you want to fall in love with me,” one of the women remembers him muttering, without looking in her direction. “She tried responding to him and he was just not connecting the dots,” says another woman who observed the interaction. “We didn't necessarily see anything, but you could tell they were on some sort of substance.”


	Three people present described the manner of the two strangers as detached and off-putting, and said their story just did not add up. Eventually, two men from the camp politely but firmly ushered the interlopers out. “Most people who wander into your camp at Burning Man are looking to make friends. People want to get to know you,” one of the burners from the camp tells Rolling Stone. “These guys seemed out of it. That's just not the sort of people you want to have hang out at your camp.”


	Late that night, long after the Temple Burn, some attendees had gone back out for one last night of partying on the playa, while others hung out in the relative quiet of open camping, with the ever-present thump of EDM far off in the distance.


	Shortly after midnight, the burners remember, their serenity was interrupted by a group of law enforcement officers who entered the camp to ask questions. They presented them with two photographs, each featuring one of the strangers from earlier in the day. The burners say the cops told them they were investigating Saturday night's homicide and the photographs were potential suspects.


	“We were like, ‘Oh my gosh! Yeah, we've seen them,” one of the burners tells Rolling Stone. “They were at our camp earlier today!'”

	











	The two men may have been completely innocent. Nothing about their interaction with the burners at camp tied them directly or indirectly to Saturday night's homicide. But the police asked so the burners answered, recounting all they could about the strange interaction. They offered up the water jug that one of the men had drunk from as evidence, but, they say, the officers weren't interested. About 20 minutes after the cops left, two rangers — Burning Man volunteers who operate like a cross between a paramedic and a peace officer — arrived with more pictures of the same men. They described the men as “persons of interest.” The rangers poked around camp with flashlights, striking up conversations with people still awake, and left.


	On Wednesday, Sept. 3, Kruglov's friend Sofiia Shcherbakova posted on Instagram that he was missing. “Last seen at the Burning Man festival 4 days ago,” she wrote. “He has not been in contact since. His tent and belongings were left at camp, but he never returned.” The next day, authorities announced that he was dead.


	WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT, one gets the impression that the authorities did not immediately grasp the full implications of what happened at Burning Man in its final weekend. The strange men from the photographs may have only been witnesses to a possible homicide, or they may have had nothing to do with it at all. But someone slashed Vadim Kruglov's throat at Burning Man on the evening of Aug. 30, which is to say that, on Aug. 31, there was likely a killer, or killers, on the loose in Black Rock City. Thankfully, BRC didn't experience any further outbreaks of violence, but it was a potentially dangerous situation, and one that would seem to call for a temporary but unambiguous shift in behavioral norms. If, as law enforcement officers told the burners I spoke with, suspects had been identified by Sunday evening, perhaps the authorities feared publicizing the fact would compromise the investigation. But neglecting to spread the word to the community might also cause a group of well-intended burners to unknowingly invite into camp a desperate person who had killed someone 24 hours earlier.


	Inevitably, within moments of the effigy of the Man crashing to the ground Saturday night, a few burners begin departing from Black Rock City. What starts as a tiny queue grows hour by hour on Sunday and Monday into a vast migration of vehicles caked in gray playa dust and packed with exhausted humans—the whole phenomenon is an experience unto itself known in Burning Man-speak as “exodus.”

	











	There is a single two-lane road into and out of Black Rock City, which terminates at the Burning Man gate. To make for a more energy efficient and less nerve-racking exodus experience, once the line grows large enough, pulsing begins, wherein vehicles move in packs rather than lurch along at 5 mph. One pack moves several miles down the road while the pack behind it sits and waits. When the first pack reaches the next stopping point the pack behind it follows. People use the opportunity to turn their car off, get out and walk around, dance, toss a frisbee, and share snacks with the people in the next car. It would be difficult to design more favorable conditions in which to implement an easy, unobtrusive, and effective law enforcement check point to search for, say, a murder suspect. And yet, I can find no evidence that any such checkpoint — any checkpoint at all — was put in place. When asked specifically about this, police once again declined to comment.


	The apparent lack of checkpoints was just one aspect of a law enforcement response that many found lacking. If there were suspects identified, law enforcement made no public announcement of the fact, though a suspected murderer could certainly pose a threat to public safety. Nor, it appears, did law enforcement advise people against welcoming strangers into camp, or giving strangers rides during exodus — an extremely common occurrence normally that, under the circumstances, would certainly make it easier for someone hiding from the cops to skip town.  


	Where the official response to this tragedy was lacking, the Burning Man community stepped in to fill the gap. Burners from the camp that had the unsettling interaction with the possible suspects ultimately spread the word to their camp and others in the vicinity to consider closing camp for the rest of the burn, to not be as reflexively welcoming to strangers as as they would normally be, and not give rides to hitchhikers when leaving BRC. While the official, and confidential, investigation continues, Kruglov's friend Shcherbakova has been a tenacious advocate for bringing those responsible to justice and herself has become a kind of clearinghouse for the community's own public investigation. She has also launched a GoFundMe to help cover the various unexpected costs incurred by Kruglov's family. (She did not respond to a request for an interview.)


	It is inevitable that an act of violence of the kind that took Vadim Kruglov's life will leave a lasting impact on Burning Man and the burner community, in one way or another. Whether the nature of that impact is grounded in fear and paranoia or in inclusivity and the spirit of mutual aid is ultimately up to the community, and how it responds to this moment.

	“I take the long view on this,” says Tim LaVelle. “A life was born, a life was taken. In the grand scheme of things, I still think the Black rock city is safer than pretty much any other place on earth.” If undue focus is placed on this tragedy — in other words, on Kruglov's horrific death rather than his, by all appearances, radiant life — and newcomers, the lifeblood of Burning man, are scared away, it could have a serious and deleterious impact on the community. Overall, however, the burners I spoke to were confident in Burning Man to make it through this.


	“Burning man is the tip of the spear of art and culture,” LaVelle says, “and the thing that makes that so important is that the community is so strong.”

Zach Bryan was a surprise guest at this weekend's Born & Raised Festival in Pryor, Oklahoma, popping up on Saturday to sing with Gabriella Rose during her afternoon set. But Bryan also seems to have seized the opportunity to confront Gavin Adcock, a Georgia country singer who has criticized Bryan and was scheduled to perform that same day.


	In a video posted online, Bryan appears to scale a barbed-wire fence backstage and charge at a figure that appears to be Adcock, dressed in a vest and hat, before a security guard holds Bryan back. Adcock is seen pointing at Bryan as he descends the fence and lunges in Adcock's direction. Reps for Bryan and Adcock did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone's requests for comment.

	“If they open up this fucking gate, I'll fucking kill you,” Bryan appears to say in another video posted to Instagram. “I got a show to play, you clown son of a bitch,” Adcock seems to goad him, suggesting the encounter happened prior to Adcock's performance. 

	











	Bryan's beef with Adcock began back in July, when Adcock called out the “Something in the Orange” singer-songwriter for the way Bryan responded to a teenage fan on social media who lamented waiting in vain for Bryan to sign an autograph following a performance at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. “You're not entitled after someone plays two and a half hours to a picture or a hello,” Bryan wrote.

	In an appearance on Rolling Stone's Nashville Now podcast, Adcock accused Bryan of pretending to be something he's not. “I think that Zach Bryan puts on a big mask in his day-to-day life and sometimes he can't help but rip it off and show his true colors,” Adcock said. “I don't know if Zach Bryan's really that great of a person.”

This is for Charley #zachbryan #gavinadcock 


	Adcock hasn't been shy about courting controversy. For the past few weeks, he's been embroiled in a back-and-forth feud with cowboy singer Charley Crockett. During a concert appearance this month with Morgan Wallen, Adcock joined Wallen onstage and held up a T-shirt that appeared to feature Crockett's photo. In a clip circulating online, Wallen flips off the shirt with a pair of middle fingers.

	Bryan has also been in his share of drama, sending volleys back and forth with his ex, Brianna LaPaglia, and also squaring off with fellow Oklahoma singer-songwriter John Moreland. Bryan removed the song he and Moreland recorded together, “Memphis; the Blues,” from all streaming services after Moreland raised an eyebrow at Bryan's reported $350 million publishing deal.


	Sharing a screenshot of Moreland's original post, Bryan responded: “Yooo just saw this from an artist I've always respected and supported. Not trying to be dramatic, but refuse to have anyone with a problem with me on my records.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q='unidentified+flying+objects'","Leaked UFO video raises big questions: Alien tech or foreign drone test?","https://www.floridatoday.com/story/opinion/2025/09/14/uap-video-alien-tech-drone-test-or-military-cover-up/86076327007/","Sun, 14 Sep 2025 09:10:07 GMT","

Buried in all the news this week was another congressional hearing on UFOs.

For some reason, our government now prefers the acronym UAP, which stood for Unidentified Aerial Phenomena until they changed it again Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. So, in other words, an unidentified flying object or UFO, right?

The highlight of this week's congressional hearing was a leaked military video purportedly taken by a U.S. military MQ-9 Reaper Drone showing a hellfire missile striking sphere-like object in the skies off the coast of Yemen and having little to no effect.

Having lived on the Space Coast for 24 years, I've long wondered what the military and people at NASA know about UFOs and have been surprised at the lack of information made available to the public regarding the possibility that we are not alone.

After watching the video, I was dumbfounded. Is this the smoking gun, the proof that so many have longed for? Was this finally proof that an alien invasion was imminent?

I sought out some experts in the field.

Author, researcher and filmmaker Mike Ricksecker, who's been featured on the History Channel's “Ancient Aliens and The UnXplained” shows, called the release of the video footage an ""astonishing revelation.""

But he had questions similar to mine.

""First of all, why was the drone firing upon the sphere?"" he said. ""Did someone authorize the firing of the missile or was this simply automatic by the drone?""

I spoke to a family member who served several tours in Afghanistan and he told me there is a chain of command and permission needed before a Hellfire Missile is fired.

""Was there any attempt at communication? Was there some sort of perceived threat and, if so, what was that threat?"" Ricksecker added.

""I believe those are the most pertinent questions, but upon seeing this footage we also have to ask ourselves, what sort of technology could cause this result? The Hellfire Missile was designed for anti-armor attacks and is able to destroy any known armored vehicle in the world, and it lost. The target, while it seemed to lose a few bits and veered from its course momentarily, rebounded almost immediately and kept going. That's not a known technology we have here on Earth ... unless something else is being hidden from us, militarily or otherwise.""

Was it finally time to build my bunker in the backyard? Were the monsters really due on Maple Street?

Not so fast, says Adam Frank, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Rochester whose research delves into Theoretical Astrophysics, and in particular the hydrodynamic and magneto-hydrodynamic evolution of matter.

Frank said there are way too many unknowns to make any sort of scientific declaration based on what he described as a ""grainy video with blobs on it that comes with a predigested story.""

""If you really want to know what it is, you've got to do a proper investigation of it,"" he said. ""That means knowing what time of day is it? What instrument is being used? Where is the sun when this is happening? Right now that can't be answered. We're just given this thing and we're told it's an amazing mystery.""

The other thing to take into account, Frank said, was that the object was not moving very fast since Hellfire Missiles are used mainly to attack stationary or slower-moving objects like tanks and helicopters.

But the biggest takeaway from my discussion with Frank was something I hadn't noticed on the video or even considered. The missile never detonated.

""It's not like you see the missile hit whatever the thing was and explode in a giant explosion and then the thing propagates away from it like in one of those science fiction movies,"" Frank said.

""It looks like it's a glancing blow right which means that the targeting wasn't that great. What you see is the missile's trajectory changes like it it clearly knocks into something and it diverts the path. You see it move, so this is not some kind of super alien technology which is impervious to anything, it kind of behaves like you might expect something to behave if it got a glancing blow from a fast moving object.""

OK, so maybe it's not from outer space. But what the heck is it?

Florida Congresswoman and chair of Declassification of Federal Secrets Anna Paulina Luna, R-Florida, wants to know as well. She has been calling on the government to be more transparent when it comes to these types of things.

""From Roswell to the coast of Jacksonville, the sightings of UFO's have rarely been explained by the people who have first-hand accounts of these situations,"" she said last year.

""This is largely due to the lack of transparency by our own government and the failure of our elected leaders to make good on their promises to release explanations and footage and mountains of classified documents that continue to be hidden from the American people.""

I've only recently come across the term “Peer State Adversary,” meaning a country with similar technology as ours that is adversarial. We used to call them enemies. Anyway, more likely than an alien spacecraft, the object on the video could be a drone operated by one of those adversarial countries. And if that's the case, Frank explains, the military would have good reason to keep tight-lipped about it.

For example, Frank said, what if a country like China or Iran was testing the camera-spoofing technology of an experimental drone? Our military leaders would not want to tip their hand and reveal to those nations what we know about them.

OK, makes sense.

“As somebody who studies the possibility of life in the universe professionally, I would love if we found aliens,"" Frank said. ""That would answer the question I've been interested in my whole life. But there's just nothing there to be able to make that giant leap without the right kind of scientific evidence.""

I gotta admit being relieved after speaking with Frank. The bunker can wait, for now.

Researchers in China have conducted the most thorough search yet for alien radio signals in the nearby TRAPPIST-1 system, which may harbor potentially Earth-like planets.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


TRAPPIST-1 is a red dwarf star located about 40 light years away that hosts seven Earth sized rocky planets, with at least three orbiting in the habitable zone where liquid water could potentially exist. This makes it one of the most Solar System like exoplanet systems discovered, with TRAPPIST-1e considered among the best potentially habitable exoplanets. The system's proximity and multiple potentially habitable worlds make it an ideal target for searching for technological civilizations.

 




The research team conducted their search using the Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) to exploit its unprecedented sensitivity. The observations consisted of five independent L-band pointings, each with a 20 minute integration, for a total time of 1.67 hours. The frequency coverage spanned 1.05 to 1.45GHz with a spectral resolution of ~7.5Hz allowing them to detect extremely weak radio signals that might indicate alien technology.

The team led by Guang-Yuan Song from the Dezhou University in China looked for very precise radio frequencies that slowly changed over time due to planetary motion.

Such signals would be virtually impossible to produce naturally and would strongly suggest artificial origin from an advanced civilization. Based on the configuration of FAST, the researchers had the ability to detect radio signals as weak as 2.04×10^10 watts. This means they were able to detect fainter signals than any previous studies. If there were aliens transmitting radio signals regularly on a specific frequency, this study would be more likely to find them than earlier attempts.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

 




Alas, the search found no convincing evidence of alien technology. However, rather than being disappointing, this result still provides valuable scientific information. It places upper limits on the presence of certain types of alien transmitters in the TRAPPIST-1 system and demonstrates the remarkable capabilities of modern SETI searches.

—Will the James Webb telescope lead us to alien life? Scientists say we're getting closer than ever.

—Cosmic rays could help support alien life on worlds outside the 'Goldilocks zone'

It may be some years or even decades before we can completely rule out life in the TRAPPIST-1 system but at least for now, it remains a compelling target for future SETI efforts. The team plans to expand their search to look for other types of signals, including periodic or transient transmissions that might be missed by current methods.

The search for extraterrestrial life represents one of humanity's most profound scientific quests—one that could fundamentally reshape our understanding of our place in the universe. Yet current telescopes face an almost impossible challenge: separating the faint glow of planets from stars that greatly outshine them.

Now, a radical new telescope design solves this problem. Unlike current circular telescopes like the Hubble or the James Webb, this design is a long rectangle, about 66 feet long by 3.3 feet tall. According to a new research study published in Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences, the new design will be able to detect a record number of habitable planets in a record time span, while being easier to implement and less expensive than current and future generation of space telescopes.

The author of the study, astronomy professor Heidi Newberg and her team at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY, says it's a bizarre shape that goes against centuries of telescope building. But Newberg believes the design will vastly improve the chances of discovering extraterrestrial life.

Computer simulations detailed in the team's research show the rectangular telescope could discover approximately 11 habitable exoplanets around the 15 closest sun-like stars in just one year of operation. Expanding to 46 target stars within 108 light-years, the mission could identify 27 potentially habitable worlds in 3.5 years—meeting NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory goal at a fraction of the cost and complexity.

Newberg's design abandons the centuries-old assumption that telescopes must be circular. Instead, Newberg's team proposes a design that delivers the resolution of a massive circular telescope while fitting into existing launch capabilities for spacecrafts. To do so, the concept leverages an optical principle: resolution depends on the longest dimension of a telescope's primary mirror.

The technical specifications are deceptively simple and elegant. This is how it works: Imagine you're trying to spot a firefly sitting next to a giant searchlight from miles away—that's essentially what astronomers face when hunting for planets around other stars.

Stars are so blindingly bright that any planets orbiting them get completely washed out. To image the planet alone, the telescope uses a device called an Achromatic Interfero Coronagraph—a well-known astronomical device that is basically a sophisticated light-blocking system that works like noise-canceling headphones, but for starlight instead of sound.

It splits the incoming light into separate beams, then smashes them back together in a way that the star's light cancels itself out while the planet's light survives the process. The beauty is that this technique only needs to dim the star by about a million times (which sounds impossible but is actually pretty manageable with current technology), rather than the billion-times dimming required when looking at regular visible light. This makes planet hunting dramatically easier than previous methods.

The proposed telescope would use a segmented beryllium mirror—similar to Webb's successful hexagonal design—folded for launch aboard a Falcon Heavy rocket. And here is where the magic comes in: Unlike circular telescopes that provide uniform resolution in all directions, the rectangular design concentrates its resolving power along a single axis.

To find planets at any angle around their stars, the telescope rotates 90 degrees between observations, effectively scanning the sky in two perpendicular orientations. This is done with a sensor that only looks at a specific type of invisible light called infrared (think heat vision) at a wavelength of about 0.0004 inches, which is where planets that could support life naturally glow the brightest from their own heat.

The problem of this approach is that you need to keep the telescope in a perfectly still point in space at all times while it rotates. Think of the astronomer like a sniper who needs to hit a target the size of a pinhead from 20 miles away—except the target is keeping a space telescope perfectly still while it's hurtling through space at thousands of miles per hour.

The telescope needs to stay pointed in exactly the right direction with mind-boggling precision: if it drifts off course by even 1.25×10−9 radians—the width of a human hair viewed from 500 miles away—the whole observation gets ruined.

This is actually four times more precise than the already incredibly steady James Webb Space Telescope, and the reason is simple physics—because this new telescope can see finer details along one direction, it's like having a more powerful zoom lens that amplifies every tiny wobble, so the whole system has to be that much more rock-solid to compensate. It's a challenge, Newberg says, but it's doable.

The design faces other technical uncertainties around structural stability, thermal control, and vibration management across its 66-foot span. However, these challenges are comparable to those NASA solved for Webb's segmented mirror system. The space agency has extensive capabilities for “high-fidelity modeling and environmental test (cryovac and vibration)” that would apply directly to the rectangular design.

Other engineering challenges, while significant, appear solvable with existing technology too. “I have asked scientists to be more expert in space telescope vibration, flexion, and thermal stability and have gotten responses ranging from ‘might be a problem' to ‘not a problem.' No one has seen an obvious reason that this would not work,” Newberg tells me.

Multiple teams worldwide are pursuing other approaches to overcome the challenge of hunting planets with alien life, each representing billions of dollars in development costs and decades of technological advancement. All of them, however, stick with traditional round mirrors.

The LUVOIR (Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor), for example, proposes two concepts resembling James Webb, with segmented hexagonal mirrors assembled in a circle, one 26 feet in diameter, the other 49 feet. They will be equipped with an ultra-high-contrast coronagraph capable of blocking starlight by ten billion to one. This visible-light approach demands unprecedented precision in optical engineering.

HabEx (Habitable Exoplanet Observatory) takes a different path: a 13-foot telescope paired with a massive 171-foot starshade that flies 47,600 miles away to physically block stellar light. Moving this enormous shadow between target stars would require immense fuel expenditure.

Another radical approach is the European LIFE mission, which calls for a swarm of small telescopes flying in perfect formation, always coordinated with each other. But if the position accuracy of Newberg's design is a challenge, LIFE's requirements are nuts. They need to maintain positioning accuracy “precisely calibrated to the size of a typical molecule,” as Newberg describes it to me. It's a requirement, she says, that remains “currently infeasible.”

Newberg claims that her team's design avoids all the pitfalls of its rivals. “I would argue that my concept is the ‘conservative' one for identifying nearby, habitable exoplanets,” she tells me. “Neither the LUVOIR or HabEx proposals were selected in the National Academies Committee for a Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020 because they knew that the technology was not mature enough to develop a reasonable time and cost estimate for these missions”

That's not to say that the design doesn't have limitations. Its infrared sensor can only see a fraction of the spectrum, the one that serves to locate life, but it will not allow us to see the planet or get additional information about it.

“This means that we would need to tune the coronagraph to different wavelengths at different times and take individual exposures to observe different molecules,” Newberg explains.

She also told me that the new design will be perfect to quickly detect the alien life candidates for more detailed observations in the future: “These more complex observatories require more time to develop the technology, and would benefit from a curated list of very interesting targets to observe,” she says.

One limitation of its rectangular design is that it produces elongated “cigar-shaped” point sources rather than round images. “If the Hubble Space Telescope was rectangular, all of those beautiful images would look smeared out in one direction, so that each of the stars would be cigar-shaped,” Newberg acknowledges. For exoplanet hunting, this limitation proves irrelevant—separating two point sources matters more than image aesthetics.

So yes, the planets can be seen as separated from their stars, just not the way you'd see them with your naked eye (although the images will likely be processed into photos that look normal for public use). But as long as the evidence of life is visible, that's all that matters.

This telescope “redesign” benefits both science and taxpayers. Newberg says the cost advantages of this design are substantial compared to any other. While still requiring approximately $1 billion—making it a major space mission—the rectangular telescope would cost significantly less than alternatives demanding new technologies or multiple spacecraft.

The simpler design reduces both development risks and operational complexity, potentially accelerating the timeline to first results by decades compared to more ambitious concepts.

The rectangular concept could revolutionize high-resolution space astronomy beyond this single mission. The same principle could work at different wavelengths—a 66-foot rectangular mirror observing in visible light could theoretically detect Earth-like planets out to 650 light-years, though with far greater technical challenges.

However, the reach of roughly 100 light-years is exactly what's needed for humanity's next dream. Within around 100 light-years of Earth lie the only stars we could realistically explore with robotic probes on human timescales. “The closer the exoplanet is, the more likely we could send a probe to investigate, establish communication with its residents, or possibly one day visit,” she says.

Newberg says the telescope could enable a probe that could beam back images of the planet's surface. “The rectangular telescope could provide a straightforward path towards identifying our sister planet: Earth 2.0,” Newberg says.

What distinguishes music above all else is its power to shape how we feel 

I'm a scientist by nature and have been since the age of five when my dad bought a set of encyclopaedias that had a section on the stars and planets. From that point on I was hooked by the wonders of the universe and ended up doing a PhD in astronomy, before becoming a freelance science writer.

But I've always had another passion, which I think came from my mum. She was a talented amateur soprano and used to sing these wonderful arias and other classical songs in full voice while doing jobs around the house. Later in life she developed Alzheimer's as a result of which she forgot who her family was, didn't recognise herself in the mirror, and would get lost in her own home. Yet if a song came on the radio that she'd known when young, she'd join in, somehow accurately remembering both lyrics and tune.

There's something about music that's unique, artistically and neurologically. And to a scientist that makes it intriguing. Almost 20 years ago, I decided to delve more into music by taking singing lessons and beginning to write my own songs, some of which eventually found their way onto an album I recorded called Songs of the Cosmos. 

Ten years ago, I joined a newly formed choir, The Noteables, in Dundee and discovered firsthand the benefits of being part of a community of other voices. At the same time, I wrote a series of popular books on maths with a talented student of mine. And so, through these various influences coming together, I was led to write my latest book – A Perfect Harmony: Music, Mathematics and Science.

Music is older than civilisation. Flutes have been found in European caves, carved from animal bones, that are tens of thousands of years old. Musical scales, not unlike those used in popular songs today, were known at the time of the first cities in Mesopotamia, more than 5,000 years ago. Later, with the ancient Greeks, came an understanding of the link between music and mathematics. The sounds of vibrating strings are most consonant, or pleasant to the ear, when the lengths of strings are in simple ratios.

Music and maths are deeply entwined. Through music, patterns of numbers are infused with passion and life. Underpinned by maths, music gains structure and sense. All of this takes place in the physical world, in which sound waves, produced by an instrument or the human voice, travel through the air to our ears. Then an incredible thing happens: the musical sounds somehow evoke in our brains an emotional response. 

Define music how you will – in terms of tones, rhythm, melody or harmony – what distinguishes it above all else is its power to shape how we feel and even send shivers down our spine.

From ancient times to the late Middle Ages, music was a core subject in all forms of higher learning. It was on an equal footing with geometry, arithmetic and astronomy in the ‘quadrivium', which was the cornerstone of liberal arts education. It was believed, in fact, that celestial bodies, like the sun, moon and planets made sounds as they moved around the heavens – the so-called ‘music of the spheres'. 

Recent research on the benefits of music has shown that studying music and, especially, playing an instrument, helps with language processing, memory retention, maths and social-skills development. 

It's also reassuring to find, as other research has shown, that it's never too late to reap the benefits from learning an instrument or starting to sing. Seniors who take up the piano or another instrument, or simply sing along with others in a choir, appear to be more resistant to age-related cognitive and memory problems. One reason for this might be the creation of alternative connections in the brain that can compensate for mental decline as we get older. 

More and more people are discovering the health benefits of music, especially through joining community choirs. In a world where an increasing amount of social interaction takes place online community singing is remarkably effective at establishing broad, face-to-face social networks. Increasing evidence suggests that in-person social connections can play a vital role in maintaining health. 

In light of mounting concerns about loneliness and isolation it's interesting and encouraging that people seem to be rediscovering a deep-seated potential to connect with one another through song.

The bond between science and music is nowhere more evident than in the number of scientists who've played or composed music, and musicians who've been inspired by science. Einstein famously said: “Life without playing music is inconceivable to me. I see my life in terms of music.” Exploring the harmony of music, maths and science should be part of every school curriculum and is something from which we can all benefit.

In honor of the show's 20th anniversary, Supernatural star Jared Padalecki shared a look at two of his treasures from the show's beginnings.



Series creator Eric Kripke, stars Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, and Misha Collins, and the rest of the SPN Family have been making the most out of today, the 20th anniversary of Supernatural. Previously, we were treated to an anniversary trailer and compilation video, Ackles, Padalecki, and Collins getting the word out about a worthy cause, and Kripke shared his early plans for the episodes following the pilot. Heck, we even got an update on The Boys: Vought Rising out of all of it.

Now, Padalecki has taken to social media to offer some treasured items from the early days of the show's eventual 15-season run. ""Here is my script from our Pilot Table Read (yes, it's dated March 1, 2005. Happy birthday [Jensen Ackles]). And, here are my ""sides"" from Day 1 of filming [Supernatural]… Wednesday, March 2nd, 2005…,"" Padalecki shared in his caption, including images of what he was sharing. Here's a look at Padalecki's post, followed by the complete text:

So, get this….

I found some stuff.

I suppose i had been holding onto them, for more than 20 years now (😳), because I just felt like they'd mean ""something more"" one day…

Well, today is the day…

Here is my script from our Pilot Table Read (yes, it's dated March 1, 2005. Happy birthday @jensenackles)

AND, here are my ""sides"" from Day 1 of filming #supernatural… Wednesday, March 2nd, 2005…

These sat in my pocket for our entire first day of filming, while I nervously tried to do a good-enough job on a show that I was thrilled to be a part of, and with a character I already loved…

Little did I know that I'd gain a family, MORE THAN ONE family, in the years to come.

So grateful for #supernatural

So grateful for the #spnfamily

Happy 20.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","This Iconic Season 1 Episode Still Has One of 'Supernatural's Scariest Monsters Ever","https://collider.com/supernatural-season-1-bloody-mary-episode/","Sun, 14 Sep 2025 16:10:00 GMT","

As the weather gets colder and Halloween slowly approaches, a comfort show like Supernatural is a perfect binge for fall. Nothing gets one into the spooky mindset quite like the early years of Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester's (Jensen Ackles) extended hunting career, as they tackle ghosts, demons, and monsters on the daily. For an excellent episode that's simply perfect for audiences getting ready for the spooky season to officially commence, there's no better case than that of a cursed mirror with a spectral force that nearly finished the Winchesters: Season 1's ""Bloody Mary.""

The fifth episode ever of Supernatural, ""Bloody Mary,"" is still pretty early in the Winchesters' adult partnership, as Sam and Dean work through the kinks of hunting together without their father, but that serves the narrative well. The Season 1 context is one of heightened tension, especially since Sam looks for an emotional anchor in each case, often tying back to his grief over his recently deceased girlfriend Jessica (Adrianne Palicki). In this tale, that grief manifests itself in a powerful and dangerous way as the brothers encounter the titular vengeful spirit ""Bloody"" Mary Worthington (Jovanna Huguet). Like many of Supernatural's earliest hours, ""Bloody Mary"" feels like it's been ripped straight out of a horror movie. The basic plot — folks in Toledo, Ohio, drop dead due to the Bloody Mary urban legend, which, as it turns out, may just be real — expertly brings the haunting thrills of The Ring to television through the title character.

Perhaps one of the scariest episodes of the entire series, this Season 1 thriller creatively uses reflective surfaces to make its vengeful spirit a threat that feels impossible to escape. Able to jump mirror-to-mirror, Bloody Mary haunts her victims before taking on their form, before liquifying their eyeballs to the point of death. Whether her initial faceless form (covered by her long hair, a la Samara Morgan) gives you the chills or you're haunted by the concept of an evil mirror self with bleeding eyes, there's no denying that ""Bloody Mary"" is still considered one of Supernatural's most terrifying episodes by fans. To this day, many still regard it as one of the show's best, helping set the initial tone and stretch the limits of how personal these weekly horror stories could actually be. Because the evil spirit only kills those with a dark secret, ""Bloody Mary"" leverages Sam's guilt and pain following Jessica's death to its advantage, introducing a story element that would establish the younger Winchester's psychic premonitions later in the season.

The premise of ""Bloody Mary"" alone is one that sends chills up one's spine. After all, who hasn't been dared to recite ""Bloody Mary"" alone in a dark room in front of the mirror at least once as a kid? But what makes this Supernatural episode stand out among the rest is that the execution is equally effective as the basic plot itself. The evil spirit herself is scary as all get out, and the way that the supporting characters respond to her appearance, especially Marnette Patterson's Charlie, really sells it. As Sam and Dean tackle this American urban legend, they eventually discover the dark mirror at the center of it all, and while the episode consistently delivers on its horror promises, the most notable sequence comes at the very end when the Winchesters attempt to destroy this cursed object...

While there are many Supernatural episodes out there with decent premises that don't quite stick the landing (""Bugs"" or ""Bloodlines,"" anyone?), ""Bloody Mary"" is certainly not one of them. Like some of the best horror movies out there, the episode waits until the very end to reveal all its cards and offer a final bout of terror that nearly takes the Winchesters out in the process. After Sam is nearly consumed by the evil spirit, who has begun to punish him for his secret about Jessica, Dean shatters the mirror. Though the brothers think that it's all over, the villainess quickly crawls out of the broken glass and appears before them in physical form. If seeing Bloody Mary on reflective surfaces throughout the episode was enough of a fright, then this sequence will put you over the edge.

The way that the editor uses jump cuts to enhance the creep factor of the vengeful spirit, making her appear more ethereal and inhuman as she steps on the remains of her glass prison and attempts a final charge on Sam and Dean, is absolutely horrifying and impressively inspired. It manages to make the threat appear terribly real. The combination of dark visuals, the show's original film-stock look, and the riveting score make this bit feel like a televised airing of a 2000s horror movie where anything can happen. 

After a scene like this, Supernatural only solidified its potential as a horror show. It proved any naysayers wrong that these types of urban legend thrills could be told in a weekly television format, and surpassed scares previously seen on shows like The X-Files or Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It's no wonder that ""Bloody Mary"" became one of Supernatural's most memorable episodes. In fact, when Chuck (Rob Benedict) brought back some of the brothers' most formidable opponents in Season 15, the spirit of Mary Worthington (with Jovanna Huguet reprising her role) was one of them. Of course, Supernatural had changed so much by then that her final season scares didn't land as effectively as they did back in Season 1.

When Supernatural first began, it wasn't so much a fantasy series as it was a horror show. In fact, when speaking with the Chicago Tribune about the series back in 2008, creator Eric Kripke admitted as such. ""When we started out, we were going to make a horror movie every week,"" Kripke explained. ""It was about the monsters, and it was about Hook Man and Bloody Mary and the urban legends..."" While this eventually changed as the demon plot grew into a larger mythology dealing with the biblical apocalypse, with Season 4 being the catalyst, there's something still remarkably special about those early episodes.

Frights like Season 1's ""Scarecrow"" or the body-horror freak-out ""Skin"" added layers to the brothers' relationship while still delivering memorable monsters that would leave a mark on fans for years to come. Supernatural was always such a thrill back when it dumped the Winchesters in a new horror flick each week, something it strayed from as it continued.

No doubt, Supernatural definitely found its own unique voice over the years. Meta episodes and more outlandish gags gave the show character, and allowed Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki to stretch their acting ability. There are plenty of great episodes of the show that don't feel too horror-esque at all, and that's a good thing. But over time, Supernatural lost its ability to deliver consistently on the horror train, making episodes like ""Bloody Mary"" feel almost like relics. Still, they make for great binges this time of year, so don't miss out on the types of stories that originally launched Supernatural into the public eye.

Supernatural is available for streaming on Netflix.

At the Journal on Thursday, professional writer Daniel Kagan Kans  took aim at theoretical physicist Sabine Hossenfelder and others as conspiracy theorists about physics:

Huh?

In recent years, a group of YouTubers and podcasters have attracted millions of viewers by proclaiming that physics is in crisis. The field, they argue, has discovered little of importance in the last 50 years, because it is dominated by groupthink and silences anyone who dares to dissent from mainstream ideas, like string theory. 

“The Rise of ‘Conspiracy Physics' Streamers are building huge audiences by attacking academic physics as just another corrupt establishment. Scientists are starting to worry about the consequences.,” September 11, 2025

At one time, a conspiracy theorist was a tinfoil hat guy. Not a gadfly on the Establishment whom we turn to when we need a fresh perspective.

Hossenfelder is right. String theory has not in fact gone anywhere, a fact that Kans admits below the fold: “String theory has not fulfilled physicists' early dreams that it would become the ultimate explanation of all forces and matter in our universe.” Dissenting physicists are bound to notice how much time, energy, and money so grand a theory sucks up while it flounders.

If physicists are starting to “worry about the consequences” of discussing long-term theory failure, it is reasonable to think that there are even more serious problems within the discipline. But first…

How did this even get started?

Late last month, as we reported, there was a nasty exchange between Johns Hopkins University cosmologist Sean Carroll and mathematical physicist Eric Weinstein.

Piers framed his segment as “For centuries, scientists have grappled with the most fundamental question of them all – what is reality? Is it a matter of common sense? Or can God or some higher being only know? And what was there before the Big Bang created the world we live in?” He pointed to Einstein and quantum physics, implying that a deep discussion would follow. 

But Carroll trashed Weinstein's theory as “a dog-ate-my-homework kind of thing.”

It wasn't a display that would cause viewers (nearly a million of them) to have much confidence in the theoretical physics establishment. Einstein, Bohr, and Heisenberg seem like distant memories here…

Hossenfelder — a theoretical physicist herself — picked up on that and offered some candid assessments on her own YouTube:

… [6:34] Eric is only one person who wrote up some notes. If he had wasted some millions of tax money on hiring postdocs and writing papers about it then he could have easily papered over these shortcomings, just like everyone else in that area.

And this is why this pisses me off so much. Sean totally knows that most of his colleagues work on similarly flaky stuff, it's just been covered up by more working hours.

The literature is full of papers without proper predictions without Lagrangians, ill-defined operators or problems that will be solved in some “future work” that never comes.

Sean knows that. Everyone in the damned field know that. But normally, no one's saying anything about it. Because they're all tied up in the same scam.

Unless the person who comes up with the idea is Eric Weinstein, in which case it's suddenly hugely offensive and everyone starts yelling. 

Sabine Hossenfelder, Physicists are afraid of Eric Weinstein — and they should be. July 16, 2025, transcribed here.

But how did this back-and-forth raise concerns about “conspiracy physics”?

Hossenfelder's accusations are consistent with a situation in physics where the star theory, string theory, has gone nowhere for decades. As Kans himself reports,

For a while, few professional physicists paid attention to their online critics or to calls for cleansing scientific corruption. But that's changed as the Trump administration has cut billions of dollars from the budget of the National Science Foundation and plans to cut more. Career paths for physicists are vanishing or leading overseas. There's a dawning awareness, Carroll says, of how much the field depends on public legitimacy.

Leonard Susskind, director of the Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics, says physicists need to be both more sober and more forceful when addressing the public. The limits of string theory should be acknowledged, he says, but the idea that progress has slowed isn't right. In the last few decades, he and other physicists have figured out how to make progress on the vast project of integrating general relativity and quantum mechanics, the century-old pillars of physics, into a single explanation of the universe. “Worry about the consequences.”

If the physics establishment is only just now becoming aware that public funding depends on public legitimacy, well, no time like the present. And carrying on about conspiracy theories will not stand in for actual achievements.

We asked experimental physicist Rob Sheldon what he makes of all this. His reply:

To begin with, I respect Sabine and Eric, though I don't often agree with them. They are sincere physicists, searching for truth, albeit in places I have dismissed already. Sean Carroll is another story. He's a funded academic, who got his position by never disagreeing with his funding sources. His treatment of Eric was disingenuous and self-serving.

But that brings up the accusations made by “Prof” Dave and Prof Carroll—conspiracy. Now there are both good and bad conspiracies. When it's your side that wins, it isn't a conspiracy of course, but rather savvy messaging or suchlike.

The one point we can be agreed on, is that one lunatic does not make a conspiracy, it takes at least 2. So Eric's theoretical physics paper—which only he understands—cannot be conspiracy physics. On the other hand, Sean's papers have enough authors and sponsors to easily pass the number threshold.

So how can we tell truth from conspiracy?

As every physicist will explain, we don't work with truth, we work with data, hypotheses, models, mathematical approximations.

So, as scientists struggle to make sense of the physical world, governments struggle over how to apportion taxpayers' money — which no one enjoys as a personal right. It's too bad if Wall Street Journal chooses to platform an attack on dissenting physicists instead of discussing these matters in a more straightforward way.

Researchers in China have conducted the most thorough search yet for alien radio signals in the nearby TRAPPIST-1 system, which may harbor potentially Earth-like planets.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


TRAPPIST-1 is a red dwarf star located about 40 light years away that hosts seven Earth sized rocky planets, with at least three orbiting in the habitable zone where liquid water could potentially exist. This makes it one of the most Solar System like exoplanet systems discovered, with TRAPPIST-1e considered among the best potentially habitable exoplanets. The system's proximity and multiple potentially habitable worlds make it an ideal target for searching for technological civilizations.

 




The research team conducted their search using the Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) to exploit its unprecedented sensitivity. The observations consisted of five independent L-band pointings, each with a 20 minute integration, for a total time of 1.67 hours. The frequency coverage spanned 1.05 to 1.45GHz with a spectral resolution of ~7.5Hz allowing them to detect extremely weak radio signals that might indicate alien technology.

The team led by Guang-Yuan Song from the Dezhou University in China looked for very precise radio frequencies that slowly changed over time due to planetary motion.

Such signals would be virtually impossible to produce naturally and would strongly suggest artificial origin from an advanced civilization. Based on the configuration of FAST, the researchers had the ability to detect radio signals as weak as 2.04×10^10 watts. This means they were able to detect fainter signals than any previous studies. If there were aliens transmitting radio signals regularly on a specific frequency, this study would be more likely to find them than earlier attempts.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

 




Alas, the search found no convincing evidence of alien technology. However, rather than being disappointing, this result still provides valuable scientific information. It places upper limits on the presence of certain types of alien transmitters in the TRAPPIST-1 system and demonstrates the remarkable capabilities of modern SETI searches.

—Potentially habitable planet TRAPPIST-1b may have a carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere

—Will the James Webb telescope lead us to alien life? Scientists say we're getting closer than ever.

—Cosmic rays could help support alien life on worlds outside the 'Goldilocks zone'

It may be some years or even decades before we can completely rule out life in the TRAPPIST-1 system but at least for now, it remains a compelling target for future SETI efforts. The team plans to expand their search to look for other types of signals, including periodic or transient transmissions that might be missed by current methods.

The search for extraterrestrial intelligence remains one of our most profound scientific endeavors, with the potential to fundamentally transform our understanding of our place in the universe. As we continue to peer out into space with ever greater precision, we're not just looking for aliens, we're taking the first steps toward what may be the most significant moment in human history.​​​​​​​​​​

NEW DELHI, September 14. /TASS/. More than 70 people have died in mass riots in Nepal, local authorities reported.

""A total of 72 people died. Another 191 injured are currently receiving care in various hospitals and medical facilities across the country,"" the news portal Nepal News said, citing the government's representative Ek Narayan Aryal.

People died in protests on September 8, and as a result of subsequent arson and riots on September 9, he said.

Riots broke out in Kathmandu and other Nepalese cities earlier this week after protests against corruption and a ban on social media. The main participants in the protests were students and activists of the Gen-Z youth movement. The protesters set fire to government buildings, including parliament, the Supreme Court, the Prosecutor's Office, and attacked the homes of politicians and officials.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

            The final stage of the Vuelta a Espana was suspended on Sunday after several large pro-Palestinian protests disrupted the premier cycling event in the Spanish capital Madrid, according to organizers.
    


            Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters occupied the final distance of the race route on Paseo del Prado in the center of the city, after a group of demonstrators pushed over crowd barriers that had lined the road.
    


            The disruption started around 6 p.m. local time on Sunday after the demonstrators gathered to protest against the Israel-Premier Tech team's participation in the competition.
    


            As witnessed by CNN, officers from Spain's National Police attempted to disperse the crowds occupying the final mile of the race route that led up to the finish line but were unsuccessful.
    


            Police deployed tear gas to try to clear people from the area, but several protesters clashed with police and formed barricades in the middle of the road, using the fences that had closed off the area as makeshift barriers.
    


            Organizers posted on social media late Sunday that the race had ended early for “security reasons,” and that there would be “no podium ceremony.”
    


            Several previous stages of the race held before Sunday had been shortened or changed because of similar protests against Israel's war in Gaza.
    


            Israel-Premier Tech expressed its regret following the event, which resulted in the cancellation of the race's finale and traditional podium ceremony.
    


            “Unfortunately, these aspects continued in Madrid this afternoon, as protestors took to the finishing circuit around the Spanish capital. After the stage was neutralized multiple times, the number of protestors blocking the route and damage caused to the race's infrastructure resulted in the cancellation of the race's finale and traditional podium ceremony,” Israel – Premier Tech said in a statement on Sunday.
    


            The team's director, Daryl Impey, praised the riders for the way they handled the situation. “There is no doubt that this was a difficult race for us, with everything we have been dealing with out on the road,” Impey said in the statement.
    


            Sunday's clashes came hours after Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he applauded the pro-Palestinian protesters who had disrupted the race.
    


            “Today marks the end of the Vuelta,” Sanchez told a Socialist party rally in the southern city of Malaga on Sunday. “Our respect and recognition for the athletes and our admiration for the Spanish people who are mobilizing for just causes like Palestine.”
    


            The Vuelta competition is Spain's top annual multi-stage professional road cycling race, composed of 21 stages that are completed in three weeks of competition.

Prime Minister Mark Carney announced on Sunday the launch of Build Canada Homes, and that the federal government will provide the agency with $13-billion in capital to build more affordable housing. 

The government has selected six cities where projects will be developed on federal lands to deliver 4,000 factory-built homes. They include Dartmouth, N.S., Longueil, Que., Ottawa, Toronto, Winnipeg and Edmonton.

Could Canada's underused public land be the key to solving the housing crisis?

Mr. Carney has tapped former Toronto city councillor and mayoral candidate Ana Bailão to head Build Canada Homes. Ms. Bailão, who was the deputy mayor during John Tory's tenure and was active on the housing file in Toronto, will serve as chief executive officer. 

Ms. Bailão was the head of affordable housing and public affairs for real estate company Dream Unlimited Corp., before entering the Toronto mayoral race in 2023. She came in second to Olivia Chow, with 32 per cent of the vote.

Build Canada Homes is being launched just ahead of Parliament's return on Monday, allowing Mr. Carney to check off another campaign promise before squaring off with Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre in the House of Commons for the first time.

Mr. Carney pitched the new government agency during the federal election campaign as a central piece of the government's plan to double the rate of homebuilding in the country. 

Of the agency's initial capitalization, $1-billion will go toward a transitional and supportive housing initiative, which will be aimed at addressing homelessness and housing insecurity. 

Ottawa plans to work with other levels of government to provide wrap-around services, which are additional supports provided to vulnerable individuals. 

The government says the agency will also partner with Nunavut Housing Corporation to build more than 700 public, affordable and supportive housing units in the territory. 

Non-profit housing advocates and stakeholders have applauded the government for prioritizing non-market housing in its vision for Build Canada Homes. However, they've been urging Ottawa to take swift action to spur construction and not wait for the entire organization to be set up first.

Build Canada Homes will also be responsible for the Canada Rental Protection Fund, which former prime minister Justin Trudeau's government promised in 2024. The $1.5-billion fund aims to help the non-profit housing sector acquire rental apartments to preserve their affordability. 

Both U.S. tariffs and slowing economic activity have weighed on housing construction, raising concerns that Canada could fall further behind on its homebuilding ambitions.

Housing starts across Canada's seven key census metropolitan areas in the first half of 2025 have been flat relative to 2024, according to a recent report from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. However, the report said the ”overall stability masked sharp regional differences.”

Housing starts in Toronto, for example, plummeted to the lowest rate since 1996, when adjusting for population.

The CMHC said the continuing construction slowdowns across major metropolitan areas “pose risks to future housing supply, work-force retention and affordability.”

“In the context of trade tensions, economic uncertainty and slower population growth, we expect combined starts across the 7 major CMAs to recover only gradually, with modest improvement by 2027,” the report said.

What to know as Parliament returns Monday, from Carney's major projects bill to U.S. trade talks and Poilievre's return

Mr. Poilievre dismissed the Liberal government's Build Canada Homes plan, predicting that it will have the effect of delaying needed construction starts.

“Today, he's going to roll out a brand-new bureaucracy,” Mr. Poilievre said in a Sunday morning speech to Conservative caucus members on Parliament Hill, a few hours before the Prime Minister's announcement.

“The funny thing is, we all agree that Canada has everything you need for affordable homes. In fact, housing should be dirt cheap, because we have the most dirt to build on. We have the builders, we have the trades, we have the companies. They have the money. They'd love to get building. 

“What's standing in the way is bureaucracy. And so Mark Carney's solution is to add another bureaucracy that will only slow things down. It took him six months to set up a new office, an office that has not built a single new home.”

A team of senior officials from the US and China is huddling in Madrid to discuss trade irritants and a nearing TikTok deadline. Meanwhile, China has announced dumping and discrimination probes into US chips. 

American and Chinese officials are meeting in Madrid, Spain on Sunday to hold talks over trade issues, national security and the ownership of short video app TikTok.

United States Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is slated to meet Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng between Sunday and Wednesday, Beijing said.

US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will also attend what are the fourth such talks between the senior officials in four months.

The series of negotiations are an attempt to keep a strained US-China relationship from crumbling under President Donald Trump's weighty tariffs.

The three senior officials and China's top trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, last met in Stockholm in July where they agreed in principle to extend a trade truce for 90 days.

The decision significantly reduced triple-digit retaliatory tariffs on both sides and resumed the flow of rare-earth minerals from China to the US.

Ahead of the Madrid talks, China on Sunday announced two investigations targeting the US semiconductor sector.

The Ministry of Commerce in Beijing launched an anti-dumping probe into certain analog IC chips imported from the US.

The investigation will target some commodity interface IC chips and gate driver IC Chips using 40-nanometer and above process technologies, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported.

In a separate announcement, the Chinese commerce ministry also launched an anti-discrimination investigation into US measures against China's chip sector.

China's probes come after the US on Friday included 23 Chinese firms to an ""entity list"" of businesses that will face curbs for allegedly acting against US national security and foreign policy interests.

Two Chinese companies accused of acquiring chipmaking equipment for Chinese chipmaking giant SMIC are on the US list.

The US export curbs and tariffs ""constitute the containment and suppression of China's development of high-tech industries"" such as advanced computer chips and artificial intelligence, a Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson said in a statement published on X.

Trade pundits have said there is a slim chance of a substantial breakthrough in the talks in Madrid which are being hosted by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, as he seeks to improve relations with China.

Reports suggest that the most likely outcome of the parleying could be another extension of a deadline for TikTok's parent company ByteDance to divest its US operations by September 17 or face a closure in the country.

The US Treasury said the talks in Spain would also cover combined efforts from Washington and Beijing to tackle money laundering.

The US has been demanding a crackdown from China on illicit shipments of technology goods to Russia that aid its war in Ukraine.

Fox News Channel host Brian Kilmeade apologized on Sunday for advocating for the execution of mentally ill homeless people in a discussion on the network last week, saying his remark was “extremely callous.”

Kilmeade's initial comment came on a “Fox & Friends” episode Wednesday and began getting widespread circulation online over the weekend. Kilmeade, a host of the morning show, was talking with co-hosts Lawrence Jones and Ainsley Earhardt about the Aug. 22 stabbing murder of Iryna Zarutska on a light rail train in Charlotte, North Carolina.

A homeless and mentally ill man, Decarlos Brown Jr., was arrested for murder, and the case received extensive attention on Fox following the release of a security video of the stabbing.

Jones was talking on “Fox & Friends” on Wednesday about public money spent on trying to help homeless people and suggested that those who didn't accept services offered to them should be jailed.

“Or involuntary lethal injection, or something,” Kilmeade said. “Just kill ‘em.”

Earhardt interjected, “Why did it have to get to this point?” Kilmeade replied, “I will say this, we're not voting for the right people.”

During an appearance on the “Fox & Friends” weekend show Sunday, Kilmeade said that “I wrongly said they should get lethal injection. I apologize for that extremely callous remark. I am obviously aware that not all mentally ill, homeless people act as the perpetrator did in North Carolina and that so many homeless people deserve our empathy and compassion.”

Fox News management did not immediately return messages seeking comment.




An advocate for homeless people said Sunday that Kilmeade's remark had been “completely devoid of all humanity.” Christine Quinn, president and CEO of Win, a provider of shelter and services for homeless children in New York City, invited Kilmeade to volunteer in one of the organization's shelters.

Kilmeade's initial remark came hours before the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah. An MSNBC analyst, Matthew Dowd, was fired for saying on the air that afternoon that hateful rhetoric can lead to hateful actions.

BASKING RIDGE, New Jersey (AP) — After years of complaints from the right about “cancel culture” from the left, some conservatives are seeking to upend the lives and careers of those who disparaged Charlie Kirk after his death. They're going after companies, educators, news outlets, political rivals and others they judge as promoting hate speech.

A campaign by public officials and others on the right has led just days after the conservative activist's death to the firing or punishment of teachers, an Office Depot employee, government workers, a TV pundit and the expectation of more dismissals coming.

This past weekend, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy posted that American Airlines had grounded pilots who he said were celebrating Kirk's assassination.

“This behavior is disgusting and they should be fired,” Duffy said on the social media site X.

As elected officials and conservative influencers lionize Kirk as a warrior for free expression who championed provocative opinions, they're also weaponizing the tactics they saw being used to malign their movement — the calls for firings, the ostracism, the pressure to watch what you say.

Such tactics raise a fundamental challenge for a nation that by many accounts appears to be dangerously splintered by politics and a sense of moral outrage that social media helps to fuel. 

The aftermath of Kirk's death has increasingly become a test of the public tolerance over political differences. Republicans are pushing not only to punish the alleged killer but those whose words they believe contributed to the death or dishonored it. At the same time, some liberals on social media have criticized those, such as actress Kristin Chenoweth, who expressed sympathy online over Kirk's death.




“This pattern that we've seen for decades seems to be happening much more now and at this moment than it ever has before,” said Adam Goldstein of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. He dates the urge to persecute people for their private views on tragedies at least to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. “If there was ever time to support the better angels of our nature, it's now.”

Goldstein noted that it's unpopular speech, like people praising the assassination, that stands as the greatest test of acceptance of the First Amendment — especially when government officials get involved. “The only time you're really supporting free speech is when it's unpopular,” Goldstein said. “There's no one out there trying to stop people from loving puppies and bunnies.”

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, has cautioned that the motive for the assassination has not been confirmed. He said the suspect in custody clearly identifies with the political left and had expressed dislike of Kirk before the shooting. But he and other authorities also say the suspect was not known to have been politically engaged.

Kirk was seen as an architect of President Donald Trump's 2024 election win, helping to expand the Republican outreach to younger voters. That means many conservatives see the remarks by liberals as fomenting violence, rather than as acts of political expression.

“I think President Trump sees this as an attack on his political movement,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., on NBC as he noted the two assassination attempts against Trump as well as Kirk's killing. “This is unique and different. This is an attack on a movement by using violence. And that's the way most Republicans see this.”

Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who is running for governor, called on social media for the firings of an assistant dean at Middle Tennessee State University and professors at Austin Peay State University and Cumberland University. 

All three lost their jobs for comments deemed inappropriate for expressing a lack of sympathy, or even for expressing pleasure, in the shooting of Kirk. One said Kirk “spoke his fate into existence.”

Some NFL teams chose on Sunday to hold a moment of silence for Kirk. Football teams have in the past chosen to memorialize victims after school shootings or an attack on a house of worship. They have also marked notable deaths of public figures, weather-related disasters and international crises such as Hamas' attack on Israel in October 2023.

Because conservatives previously felt canceled by liberals for their views, Trump on his first day back in office signed an executive order prohibiting everyone in the federal government from engaging in conduct that would “unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen.” 

In February at the Munich Security Conference, Vice President JD Vance criticized the preceding Biden administration for encouraging “private companies to silence people who dared to utter what turned out to be an obvious truth” regarding the pandemic. He assailed European countries for censoring political speech.

“Under Donald Trump's leadership, we may disagree with your views, but we will fight to defend your right to offer it in the public square, agree or disagree,” Vance said at the time.

Still, the Trump administration has also cracked down on immigrants and academics for their speech.

Goldstein noted that Trump's State Department in the minutes after Kirk's death warned it would revoke the visas of any foreigners who celebrated Kirk's assassination. “I can't think of another moment where the United States has come out to warn people of their impending cancellation,” Goldstein said.

The glimmer of bipartisan agreement in the aftermath of the assassination was in a sense that social media was fueling the violence and misinformation in dangerous ways.

“I can't emphasize enough the damage that social media and the internet is doing to all of us,” Cox said on NBC's “Meet the Press.” He said “the most powerful companies in the history of the world have figured out how to hack our brains get us addicted to outrage.”

But many Republican lawmakers have also targeted traditional news media that criticized Trump for contributing to a toxic political climate with his consistent rhetoric painting anyone against him as an enemy.

On Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures,” Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., blamed news outlets for having guests on who called Trump a “facist” or compared him to the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. 

Such statements have been borne out of Trump's attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss, his pardoning of Jan. 6 rioters and a range of policy differences. Among them, his deportations, deployment of the National Guard, mass firings of federal employees and his scorn for the historic limits on the power of the presidency.

But for Britt, those expressions were unfair, inaccurate and triggered violence.

“There must be consequences with regards to people spewing that type of hate and celebration in the face of this,” Britt said. “And I believe that there will be.”

Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes joins 'Sunday Morning Futures' to discuss Charlie Kirk's impact on the conservative movement, the effort to end the war in Ukraine and more.

A moment of silence was held in honor of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk on Saturday night before the football game between the South Carolina Gamecocks and the Vanderbilt Commodores.

Gavin J. Smith, the president of the Inspyre Group, pointed out the moment in a post on X. Smith's photo showed a packed house at Williams-Brice Stadium.

Kirk was assassinated during an event he held on the campus of Utah Valley University. He was 31. His death shook the sports world as South Carolina was far from the only team to hold a moment of silence for Kirk.

The NFL honored Kirk before the game on Thursday night between the Green Bay Packers and Washington Commanders. Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Treinen wrote Kirk's name on his baseball cap and NASCAR star Christopher Bell dedicated his victory at Bristol Motor Speedway.

The 16-year-old suspect in the Evergreen High School shooting was radicalized by online posts about white supremacy and mass shootings, according to a report from the Anti-Defamation League.

The suspected shooter, Desmond Holly, opened fire at the Denver-area high school on Wednesday, critically injuring two other students before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Before the shooting, Holly posted neo-Nazi views on his social media accounts and was active on online threads that depicted extremely graphic violence, the ADL's Center on Extremism said in a published analysis.

Spokeswoman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office Jacki Kelley said in a media press conference that the suspect was “radicalized by some extremist network.” The sheriff's office did not specify which type of extremist network this was.

“The details of that will be down the road, but we wanted to at least give you that much about maybe mindset for him,” Kelley said in the media press conference on Thursday.

The ADL Center on Extremism report says Holly spent time on an online gore forum that has “served as a gateway” for three teenage school shooters, including Holly. He appears to have joined the forum in December 2024 following the Abundant Life Christian School shooting in Wisconsin. 

He also posted content on his TikTok account that promoted white supremacist extremist language and imagery and idealized other school shooters, such as the perpetrators of the Columbine High School shooting in 1999. Columbine High School is also located in Jefferson County.

According to the ADL report, Holly posted imagery on his TikTok and X pages of himself wearing a shirt he created to mimic one of the Columbine attackers, of a revolver and ammunition hours before the shooting, and of a skull mask he wore adorned with antisemitic and school-shooting related language.

The Associated Press reported that TikTok said it has banned all accounts associated with Holly.

The Evergreen High School shooting came on the same day that 22-year-old Tyler Robinson allegedly assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah. It also came two weeks after two children and 17 others were wounded by suspected 23-year-old transgender gunman Robin Westman in the Annunciation Catholic School shooting in Minnesota.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Roller coasters are bumping against the limits of physics and the human body to keep their riders entertained.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

On a recent Friday morning, I found myself in a sea of bodies waiting to be admitted to Universal's new $7 billion Orlando theme park, Epic Universe. Speakers hidden in the foliage blared a soaring melody suggestive of a heroic quest involving swords. The adults in the crowd, most of whom were unaccompanied by minors, wore performance athletic-gear. We filed through a metal detector and presented our tickets. Then all around me, people began to run.

In recent years, Americans have drifted away from many of their once-beloved sources of pleasure: drinking, throwing parties, having sex, making friends. Yet they keep coming back to theme parks. In 2023, according to a report from the Themed Entertainment Association, 17.7 million people—more than the entire population of Sweden—visited the Magic Kingdom, one of the six parks that make up Walt Disney World, in Florida. And this is despite years of price hikes: At $199 on the busiest days, one ticket to the Magic Kingdom can cost more than a week's worth of groceries. Disney's “Experiences” division is more profitable than its TV and movie business, bringing in billions of dollars annually.

Even so, park operators have had to work hard to engineer fun at a time when people have become more fickle about what qualifies. “When Disneyland opened, it was the most exciting technological thing you could see,” Phil Hettema, who spent more than a decade working on Universal's parks, told me. “Now there's nothing I can see anywhere in the world that I can't see on my iPhone.”

From the February 2025 issue: Derek Thompson on the anti-social century

To meet this challenge, rides are bumping against the limits of physics and the human body to deliver experiences that are more death-defying than ever before. There are hyper-coasters (more than 200 feet tall), giga-coasters (more than 300 feet tall), and strata-coasters (even taller) capable of hurtling people at 120 miles an hour. A 640-foot-tall “exa-coaster” more than twice the height of the Statue of Liberty will open soon in Saudi Arabia, and will reach speeds of 155 miles an hour.

The goal is not just to delight but to overwhelm. In May, Epic Universe became the first major Florida theme park to open in more than 25 years. A complex of five themed “worlds,” it includes interactive robot dragons, a flame-throwing windmill, and a Harry Potter–inspired re-creation of 1920s Paris complete with true-to-scale Haussmann buildings overlooking imitation-cobblestone streets. I'd heard of visitors stepping inside and bursting into tears.

Walt Disney pioneered the art of micromanaging visitors' experiences when, 70 years ago, he opened his first park, Disneyland, in California. To prevent life's unpleasantness from impinging on his utopia, he did not allow the sale of newspapers and borrowed filmmaking techniques to place attractions within meticulously composed landscapes—a lush jungle, the Old West. In so doing, he helped invent what would come to be known as the theme park. “A theme park without rides is still a theme park,” wrote the researchers Margaret King and J. G. O'Boyle in an essay on the history of theme parks. “An amusement park without rides is a parking lot with popcorn.”

At the Magic Kingdom—the successor to Disneyland that opened in 1971—the themes of various parts of the park are lax by current standards: You can, for example, find Aladdin's carpets and a tiki room side by side under the broad heading of “Adventureland.” The latest thinking among park operators is that impressing visitors requires re-creating, to an unprecedented scale, complete worlds they know from movies and video games. Epic Universe is home to a wood-hewn, Viking-style land based on the How to Train Your Dragon franchise; a Super Nintendo World with perfectly spinning gold coins; and a horror-themed village inhabited by Dracula, Wolf Man, and other monsters from classic films, where the mist floating over gravestones feels eerie even under the Florida sun. The landscape at Epic Universe is so detailed that some visitors hire tour guides—which begin at $460 per person—to highlight minutiae they might miss and to share the history, both real and fictional, of their surroundings.

As I speed-walked to the Harry Potter world (which is based on a prequel to the main Harry Potter series that is set in Paris in 1927), I passed green benches manufactured by the same company that made the originals in Paris in the 1920s and, with my back to an imitation Sacré-Coeur, watched a stick bug–like animatronic creature futzing with a lock in the window of an artfully aged yellow storefront.

I lined up for the Harry Potter and the Battle at the Ministry ride accompanied by Kevin Blakeney, a landscape architect who had worked on the park and who told me that the waiting area was designed to hold eight hours' worth of people (hence the running: When the park opens, people race to get in line for the most popular rides). Blakeney, who left Universal last spring, specializes in equipping theme parks with all of the unsexy infrastructure required to function—toilets, cellphone towers—as well as ensuring that none of it impinges on the illusion. According to King and O'Boyle, visitors average eight hours in a theme park but only 10 to 15 minutes on rides.

As we stood inside a white-tiled tunnel made to look like the Paris Métro, Blakeney directed my attention to the bathroom in the line, which parks have had to install to address the growing issue of visitors relieving themselves in interminable queues. In 2019, the Orlando Sentinel reported on a 22-year-old woman who, while waiting to board an Avatar-themed ride at Disney World, “felt something wet on the back of her leg” and discovered that the man next to her was peeing. Rather than sacrifice her own place in line, she waited another 20 minutes, then alerted an employee.

To manage the thousands of people who descend daily, operators have studied visitors' behavior and engineered their parks to move people around without anyone realizing they're being nudged. One of Disney's early innovations was to lure visitors through its parks with enormous structures, such as castles, that Walt Disney referred to as “wienies,” supposedly because of the gravitational pull he observed hot dogs having on his toy poodle. These days, Disney and Universal have teams of employees who sit in front of computers and security-camera feeds in offices inside the parks, keeping an eye on wait times and gridlock. If one part of a park is too empty, employees could send out a parade to draw people from a more crowded spot. If a queue is backing up, they could deploy a character to buoy spirits or, for something like a carousel, shorten the ride from five minutes to four. Background music might have a faster, more driving rhythm in areas where operators want to keep visitors moving, and elsewhere, have an end credits–type tempo to signal that it's time to clear out. In a sense, you are on a ride from the moment you step foot in the park.

I'd watched videos of the Harry Potter ride online, and I was looking forward to flying through the air alongside dueling witches and wizards who, while firing colorful clouds of spells at one another, trash the Ministry of Magic's wood-paneled offices with help from stampeding beasts, then destroy a time-travel chamber, only to get sucked into the swirling black void of space. The difficulty of pulling off this illusion is hard to overstate. New rides like this one can cost $100 million, if not more, to create; incorporate LiDAR laser systems of the kind used on self-driving cars; and rely on robotic figures with thousands of moving parts. Designers do test runs, making minute adjustments to bring the elaborate machinery—lights, video projections, animatronics—into perfect sync. If any part of the ride becomes even a centimeter out of whack, it shuts down.

But even as rides have become more complex, the storylines behind them have gotten quicker and simpler to accommodate shrinking attention spans. “You have to create these moments where they are impactful, but they're not long enough to bore you. It's like, ‘Wow, this is great.' BOOM—and then you're just jumping on to the next one,” Thierry Coup, a former Universal executive who oversaw the creative development of Epic Universe, told me. “It's more like the TikTok philosophy.”

Lines have not gotten any shorter, though. Disney and Universal offer the option to pay extra to cut certain queues; the day I visited Epic Universe, these passes cost $300 a person, on top of the $190 entry ticket—and they were sold out. Since Disney first started experimenting with a tiered entry system in 1999, theme parks have discovered that they need to build physical barriers separating the regular and express lines. “That's a real point of frustration: to see the express moving so quickly when the standby is not,” Blakeney said. “That's when fights break out among guests.”

Harry Potter and the Battle at the Ministry sounded amazing, but I was anxious to see the rest of the park, and after eyeing the seemingly endless queue ahead of me and discovering that the ride was an hour from even opening, I wimped out of the line. I consoled myself with the thought that, according to some riders, I'd already experienced the best part: a cavernous, green-tiled room of airplane-hangar proportions that housed towering Ministry of Magic offices. I'd seen scattered grumbling online about the ride's overreliance on screens, and The New York Times' verdict was that “the queue is better than the ride.” I learned later that, on a day when the Battle at the Ministry ride went down because of technical issues, visitors had still ventured into the line just to see the waiting area.

Walking around Epic Universe, I found myself hunting for spots where reality had intruded on the fantasy. But where? In the planters lining the outdoor cafés in Harry Potter's Paris, every flower was perfectly in bloom. The only scuffing—on shop doors, on the walls of the Métro—had been artfully painted on to make the scenery look appropriately aged. Every night, Blakeney told me, an army of employees filed into Epic Universe to power wash sidewalks, deadhead the plants, repaint dirty walls, and replace lightbulbs. They'd work until dawn creating the illusion of effortless beauty.

The unnatural perfection struck me as slightly off-putting, but some people find that it can be hard to give up once they get used to it. Not long before my trip, Jill and Kevin Levett, a married couple in their 60s who live north of London, had flown to Orlando for the grand opening of Epic Universe. They were preparing to return a week later.

The Levetts, semi-retired bus drivers, first visited Orlando's theme parks together in 2012. Since then, they've basically quit vacationing anywhere except Universal's four Florida parks. They travel to Orlando four or five times a year, sometimes for weeks at a stretch, and will go to the parks in costume. Kevin often dresses as a Hogwarts Express conductor from the Harry Potter series (red vest, customized pocket watch, suit dyed the perfect shade of brown); Jill frequently goes as the imperious witch Dolores Umbridge, shouting commands in a wig, a custom-made dress, and pale-pink ballet flats. “I stay in character all day,” Jill told me. “I've scared a lot of people.”

While they're in the parks, the Levetts post updates and photos to a 184,000-person Facebook group of Universal devotees, run by a company that helps plan vacations to Orlando theme parks. Through it, the Levetts have become so recognizable that fellow Universal fans will stop them in the parks to ask for selfies. Between flights, hotels, and their annual park passes, the couple estimates they spend $20,000 a year on their Orlando trips, though this seemed conservative given that they were preparing to pay $2,600 for a private VIP tour of Epic Universe with friends from their Facebook group.

Last summer, after years of hip problems and some difficult surgeries to address them, Jill had an operation that went poorly. “When we came out of hospital, Jill was so down, so depressed, I turned around to her and said, ‘We're going to Universal,'” Kevin recalled. A few weeks later, they were on a plane to Orlando. “You can't forget everything that's going on; you can't forget the pain and things that you're going through. But it helps you escape from some of that,” he said. “It was a place we knew that we could go—”

“And we would be safe there,” Jill finished.

At Universal's parks, Kevin explained, “everything is as it should be in a perfect world.” Harry Potter's Paris at Epic Universe, for example, has magical creatures and no cigarette butts. “Obviously, if you go to Paris, you're going to see Paris as it really is,” he said. His frown made clear that “Paris as it really is” was indisputably a bad thing.

For all the warm and fuzzy feelings they engender, theme parks spend an astronomical amount of effort and money to simulate the feeling that they are trying to kill us. Stardust Racers, the sinewy roller coaster that towers over Epic Universe, shoots bodies through the sky at more than 60 miles an hour and plunges them toward the surface of the Earth from the height of a 10-story building. On a roller coaster, the theme park commands your full and undivided attention.

Roller-coaster aficionados have their own extensive vocabulary to catalog all of the techniques that rides use to give you the impression you're going to die. Stardust Racers, which a roller-coaster critic called “one of the greatest on the planet,” has “top hats” (abrupt rises and falls mimicking the shape of Abraham Lincoln's stovepipe hat); “airtime hills” (which make you feel like you're floating); “ejector airtime” (which tosses your body into the ride's restraints); a “zero-g roll” (a 360-degree twist that spins you upside down and makes you feel weightless); “crossovers” (where the track loops back on itself); and several “head-choppers” (moments where the coaster seems like it'll rip your skull off).

One of the challenges of building coasters is that each one is, essentially, a prototype—Stardust Racers is the only ride in the world that weaves two groups of people around each other and upside down, mid-air—and these prototypes must work safely and reliably from opening day, 14 hours a day, hundreds of days a year, for 30 years (the estimated lifespan of a coaster).

A roller coaster's first riders are usually about 170 pounds with a head, torso, legs, and no arms. These dummies—human-shaped plastic bags filled with water to mimic the weight of real riders—can be outfitted with sensors, then loaded on a coaster to test whether speeds and g-forces conform to the computer's predictions. Tweaks are rare, but sometimes necessary: a section of track might require reconstruction or brakes might need to be introduced to slow an unexpectedly speedy stretch. Disconcertingly, one can find videos online of dummies flying off rides during testing, though a 2005 survey of a decades' worth of fatalities in the U.S. found that an average of four people die annually from coasters, fewer than the number killed by kitchen appliances.

Roller coasters were once limited by technology, but now it's our bodies that are holding them back. Coasters can subject riders to g-forces more powerful than those typically experienced by astronauts—people on Stardust Racers will experience more than 4 g's of force, compared with the 3 g's typical during a space-shuttle launch—though industry guidelines limit how long riders should be made to endure such strong accelerations. At upwards of 4 g's, the human heart struggles to pump blood; you should experience this for no more than two seconds, per the standards for rides in the U.S. “The time is very important here because you don't want people graying out or maybe even blacking out,” Daniel Schoppen, a roller-coaster designer with the firm Intamin, which has built attractions for Universal's parks, told me. “This is not enjoyment. This is not fun.”

Once a coaster has been deemed safe, its designers ride it over and over to further finesse the experience. To Schoppen, the best coaster is like a piece of music: “Every part has its own motif, has its own feeling,” he told me. Theme parks are trying to bring back visitors by building rides that change a little each time; on Stardust Racers, which has two trains of cars racing each other on separate tracks, if one train car falls behind, it gets an extra oomph of acceleration near the middle of the ride—an additional thrill that one critic called “boost mode.”

The riders who stagger off of Stardust Racers have wide, shaky smiles. Braving a ride offers “a sense of assurance that you will survive no matter what is going on, what trials and tribulations you may be undergoing,” the Disney historian and former “Imagineer” Tom Morris told me. “It's a way of proving that you can get through it.” When the world scares us, people turn to the controlled terror of theme parks.

After the sun set, Epic Universe began to glow. I stood on the top floor of the Helios Grand Hotel, a $490-minimum-a-night Universal property where a concierge told me some guests had checked in just to stay in their room and gaze at the park all day, and watched the fountains below shoot flumes of water as the nightly light show began.

From this angle, Super Nintendo World's polka-dotted Piranha Plants bounced within view of an eight-lane highway, a reminder of how finite the fantasy really was. Theme parks are celebrated for providing an escape, but part of their appeal is that they are real brick-and-mortar spaces, painstakingly engineered for visitors' pleasure. And for all their manicured artificiality, theme parks do not necessarily spoil us on reality. The playfulness they permit can follow us out.

I was walking through the parking lot when, in between slow-moving wisps of clouds, I caught sight of a sliver of moon so horizontal, it made the night sky look crooked. How did they do that? I wondered, then immediately corrected myself: This is real.

Later, I caught myself rewatching videos of Harry Potter and Battle at the Ministry, an endless stream of which is available online, captured by people holding up phones on the ride. I kept trying to re-create the experience I'd missed, and watched them until I'd mastered each beat: The animatronic Death Eater crouching on a bookshelf casts a spell, then Dolores Umbridge appears on a screen, then a rhinoceros-like Erumpent tries to gore the riders with its horn. I got to know the ride clinically, but I kept wondering about the physical thrill. It was both frustrating and satisfying to know people were still dreaming up experiences that demanded to be felt in person.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

These books have all the qualities that make good novels so enjoyable.

Nonfiction books sometimes get a reputation for being hard to slog through. But the qualities that make good novels so enjoyable—the well-paced plot, the engaging characters—can also be found in many of their fact-based counterparts. The Atlantic's writers and editors answer the question: What is a nonfiction book that reads like fiction?

Priestdaddy, by Patricia Lockwood

This memoir is a trip. A broke 30-something poet, Lockwood returns to Kansas City with her husband to live in her parents' rectory (her father, a former Lutheran minister, sought permission from the Vatican to keep his wife and kids when he converted to Catholicism). He's the sort of priest who plays frenzied electric guitar, eats homemade pickles by the handful, and cleans his guns in front of people he doesn't like. “There's no in-between with him, is there,” Lockwood's husband observes. “He's either buck nude or he's in a little outfit.”

Lockwood's life, and lens, is so absurd that it's hard to believe any of it is real. As she reflects on a childhood spent attending pro-life protests and parishes across the Midwest, the sorts of sly, surreal observations that made her Twitter-famous are streaked with darker ones about organized religion, class, and gender. In our very-online world, where people sound more and more like one another, it's refreshing to read someone who sounds only like herself.

One of Us, by Åsne Seierstad

I wouldn't say that One of Us is easy to read. Any account of the day—July 22, 2011—that the neo-Nazi terrorist Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people, many of whom were teenagers, is bound to be horrifying and heartbreaking. And Seierstad's book is both of those things. She unpacks Breivik's troubled childhood and youthful obsessions. She traces his descent into extremism, how he holed up on a farm north of Oslo to write his manifesto and prepare for his attack in downtown Oslo and at an island summer camp close by. But what's remarkable to me is how Seierstad weaves that grim tale with deeply moving narratives of the teenagers and their families, giving their stories the care and the space they deserve. It's a book about a nightmare—the approximately 70-page description of the massacre itself is unflinching and difficult to shake—and the moments of extraordinary empathy and resilience that the atrocity revealed.

Say Nothing, by Patrick Radden Keefe

I first read Keefe's Say Nothing in the depths of COVID lockdown. Although it had come out two years prior, it was the sort of book that gained more and more traction with time. Each of its readers seemed to become an evangelist for the story—I had heard that it was one of the best works of nonfiction at least a dozen times before I picked it up. It can sometimes be difficult for a book to live up to its growing mythology, but Say Nothing is no such book.

Keefe is a master of his craft. He takes a story about one woman's murder during the Troubles, in Northern Ireland—which spanned about 30 years, from the 1960s to the '90s—and transforms it into a propulsive murder mystery, historical account, and series of riveting character studies. I felt deeply invested in the people, as well as in the sociopolitical and historical landscape, of a country I've never set foot in. And the thing is, Keefe has done this in every book he's written. There is no one quite like him in his ability to take something from the archive, or from a legal cabinet, and transform it into something that reads like your favorite novel.

Bottoms Up and the Devil Laughs, by Kerry Howley

This eminently readable book, which gets its title from a viral video of a woman ascribing satanic intent to a can of Monster Energy, expands on Howley's 2017 New York profile of the NSA whistleblower Reality Winner. But it is less a straightforward narrative than a historical and critical patchwork: a look at how the internet's ceaseless agglomeration of data has come to shape how we understand the world. As Howley demonstrates, there's more than enough information out there for everyone to come to their own conclusions about everything—hence, satanic energy drinks. The kicker is that Bottoms Up was released just a few months after the advent of ChatGPT, the aftershocks of which have only served Howley's thesis.

Eat the Buddha, by Barbara Demick

When Gonpo, the daughter of the last Mei king of Tibet, was just under 10 years old, Chinese Communists commandeered her family's palace, arrested her father, and exiled her family. Even though she ended up in Beijing, learned Chinese, and eventually integrated herself into Chinese society, she was sent to a labor compound in Xinjiang, her lineage being enough to mark her as an enemy of the Communists. She is one of the most engrossing and sympathetic characters in Demick's Eat the Buddha, a chronicle of Tibetan defiance and Chinese repression.

Much of Demick's story centers on Ngaba, a county in Sichuan province, which she calls the “undisputed world capital of self-immolations.” She focuses on the history behind this form of Tibetan protest against Chinese rule, masterfully charting the arc of Tibet's story over 90-odd years by illustrating the motivations and idiosyncrasies of colorful characters: a teacher who passes around an illegal copy of the Dalai Lama's autobiography, a Tibetan girl who loves Chinese war movies. It is through their intimate recollections and everyday lives that Demick tells the story of a community, an embattled region, and, indeed, Tibetan resistance at large.

Six Ways to Start Early and Lift Your Mood

By Arthur C. Brooks

This column generally focuses on how to become happier. But over the years, I've found that the questions I most often get from readers are less about getting happier and more about becoming less unhappy. People inquire about how to resolve relationship disputes, quit a job they hate, or deal with anxiety and sadness. Getting happier or less unhappy might strike you as equivalent efforts, but they aren't. Indeed, neuroscientists have found evidence that certain positive and negative emotions are produced in different regions of the brain. This makes sense when we understand that emotions exist to alert us to opportunities and threats, and parts of the limbic system specialize in producing each type of notification …

So my personal well-being challenge is to manage strong negative affect in the morning. I do this with the help of a six-part daily protocol, based on the neuroscience and behavioral-science research that is my trade. If you, like me, struggle to feel human in the morning, this protocol can probably help you.

Ascending the ranks as a consultant, while difficult, is a linear track for many who land in the industry. Big firms head to schools and pluck freshly minted MBAs to join their ranks. After years of mentorship, long hours, and loads of hard work, you might eventually become a partner, one of the most prestigious titles a consultant could aspire to.

That dream might be creeping out of reach for younger people trying to break into the industry, which looks to be on the cusp of a big shift as firms trim their ranks, double down on AI, and tighten performance standards across the career ladder, industry analysts told Business Insider.

No one is exactly sure how it will play out, as much of the future will depend on where the economy goes and how quickly AI is adopted. But the end result could look something like a reshaping of the profession, with fewer entry-level and senior roles—something that could make it more challenging for young people in the field trying to rise through the ranks, analysts said.

That restructuring is already faintly visible in the numbers. According to Revelio Labs, a workforce intelligence firm, job postings in the consulting sector — which encompasses both consultants and adjacent job titles in the industry — have declined each year since peaking in 2022.

In 2024, there were about 3.4 million job postings in the sector, around a 26% drop from the prior year, the firm told Business Insider.

Among consultants in particular, the monthly inflow of senior-level workers, which Revelio classifies as the ""manager"" level, dropped 22% year-over-year in June.

The inflow of entry-level consultants in June was down 54% year-over-year.

The decline, while stark, isn't necessarily apocalyptic. Management Consulted, a firm that conducts industry research and offers career guidance for consultants, says the drop is largely confined to specific areas of the market, like strategy consulting.

Strategy, which is a subset of the broader category of management consulting, makes up a small portion of the overall market. But it's what most people think of when they envision a consultant, as it involves advising businesses on key decisions like hiring and firing, spending, and expansion plans, Namaan Mian, the chief operating officer at the firm, told BI.

Mian says that many firms in the space overhired during the boom times of 2021 and 2022. Employers in that area are now under pressure to normalize headcount, he said, estimating that strategy consultant job postings were down 10% to 15% compared to levels seen during the pandemic.

McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group — known as ""The Big Three"" in the management and strategy consulting space — have seen their head count numbers slow or decline in recent years.

BCG added 1,000 employees to its head count in 2024, compared to the 5,000 it added in 2022, according to its annual sustainability report.

Bain reported it lost around 1,000 employees globally from 2022 through 2024.

McKinsey, which didn't release head count figures in its 2024 report, was reported to have around 40,000 employees this year, down 11% from levels in 2022.

Some of the firms have said they're all-in again on entry-level hiring. McKinsey, which declined to comment on its hiring outlook, directed Business Insider to a report about its plans to expand hiring, specifically for entry-level workers. BCG also directed BI to a statement about its growth in 2024.

Ron Kermisch, a senior partner and the global head of talent acquisition at Bain, told Business Insider the firm grew its summer MBA program in North America by 20% this year.

""We were just absorbing all the people who we had brought in,"" Kermisch said of the years following the pandemic. ""But now we've worked our way through that.""

But analysts who closely follow the industry are skeptical that numbers will increase meaningfully in the future. IBISWorld estimates that hiring growth in the broader category of management consulting will slow to 1.4% by the end of the decade, its slowest pace since at least 2012.

""I think that's PR positioning,"" Mian said of companies talking about ramping up hiring.""Because you still want to be seen as an aspirational brand for top talent. And if you start to talk about how entry-level hiring is going to decrease in the future, then some of this top up-and-coming talent isn't going to consider you as a potential employer.""

""I think we're going to continue to see a very gradual culling of the herd in certain practice areas at certain levels,"" he added, speculating that the shift could stretch on for as long as a decade before stabilizing.

Tom Rodenhauser, a consulting analyst and the managing partner at Kennedy Intelligence, also believes the decline in strategy consulting is more secular than cyclical.

""What's different this time around is this isn't a cycle that's going to change dramatically. There isn't going to be this huge surge and everyone's going to go back to business as usual. There's a fundamental shift going on,"" he said.

Mian thinks the industry is shifting away from the pyramid model — one with a fat base and a skinny top-tier — to one with a larger middle that is lean on the entry- and senior-level workers. He sees a few reasons for the change:

Wanting more expertise. Hiring in more specialized areas of consulting, like tech consulting, has increased in recent years. That reflects the fact that consulting firms are now looking for more experience, or those who have knowledge in a specific field, Mian said.

""These firms are emphasizing experience and expertise more than they ever have before,"" he added. ""And so, you still might be hiring nine or 10 people in a given office in a given year, but now instead of all 10 of them being undergrad analysts, maybe only half of them are.""

AI. Like many employers, consultancies have been cutting costs and leaning toward artificial intelligence. Mian says that could play a big role in entry-level hiring going forward.

A Revelio analysis found that consulting was one of the industries most exposed to AI, with 45% of activities that could be performed using artificial intelligence.

""So could that cut down on analyst hiring in the future? Absolutely,"" Mian said, adding that he believed junior talent was most at risk.

Some firms are promoting fewer partners than they were in the past. McKinsey, for instance, reportedly minted around 200 partners in 2024, about half the number of new partners it minted in 2021.

Deloitte's UK arm promoted 60 partners this year, down 25% from last year's numbers.

Kermisch said Bain had ""refined"" its recruiting process and was now searching for specific traits among its pool of potential hires. The company is seeking those who have EQ—which will allow consultants to work effectively with clients—and what he calls ""technical curiosity.""

""We want people to constantly be thinking, 'How can I apply AI here?'"" he said. ""We want people whose natural disposition is to think that way first, so they can get that work done more quickly, more creatively than they would before.""

Kermisch said he wasn't sure if it was now more difficult for consultants across the industry to become partners. He believes that large employers in the space will stick to the pyramid model, but he said it was possible that niche consultancies could have smaller entry and senior-level ranks in the future.

""They're making it harder for you to be ranked as a top performer, and so that affects the opportunities you get,"" Mian said of the partner track. ""I think it's more difficult today than it was 10 years ago.""

Rodenhauser thinks a similar change will unfold over the coming years.

""The old world — of even five years ago — and what particularly students were joining when they joined one of these firms is not going to be what it was,"" he said. ""The promise of the partnership, to become partner, spend 12 years of your life and achieve partnership and get the keys to the country club, that ain't going to happen either.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Sticky Inflation, Softer Jobs — Macro Headwinds Stir BTC Tailwinds","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/14/sticky-inflation-softer-jobs-macro-headwinds-stir-bitcoin-tailwinds","Sun, 14 Sep 2025 18:45:25 GMT","

Bitcoin BTC$115,738.02 is about 4% higher than it was a week ago—good news for the digital asset but bad news for the economy. 

The recent negative tone of the economic data points from last week raised expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates on Wednesday, making riskier assets such as stocks and bitcoin more attractive.

Let's recap the data that backs up that thesis. 

The most important one, the U.S. CPI figures, came out on Thursday. The headline rate was slightly higher than expected, a sign inflation might be stickier than anticipated. 

Before that, we had Tuesday's revisions to job data. The world's largest economy created almost 1 million fewer jobs than reported in the year ended March, the largest downward revision in the country's history.

The figures followed the much-watched monthly jobs report, which was released the previous Friday. The U.S. added just 22,000 jobs in August, with unemployment rising to 4.3%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Initial jobless claims rose 27,000 to 263,000 — the highest since October 2021.

Higher inflation and fewer jobs are not great for the U.S. economy, so it's no surprise that the word ""stagflation"" is starting to creep back into macroeconomic commentary.

Against this backdrop, bitcoin—considered a risk asset by Wall Street—continued grinding higher, topping $116,000 on Friday and almost closing the CME futures gap at 117,300 from August. 

Not a surprise, as traders are also bidding up the biggest risk assets: equities. Just take a look at the S&P 500 index, which closed at a record for the second day on the hope of a rate cut. 

So how should traders think about BTC's price chart? 

To this chart enthusiast, price action remains constructive, with higher lows forming from the September bottom of $107,500. The 200-day moving average has climbed to $102,083, while the Short-Term Holder Realized Price — often used as support in bull markets — rose to a record $109,668.

However, bitcoin's weekly positive price action didn't help Strategy (MSTR), the largest of the bitcoin treasury companies, whose shares were about flat for the week. Its rivals performed better: MARA Holdings (MARA) 7% and XXI (CEP) 4%.

Strategy (MSTR) has underperformed bitcoin year-to-date and continues to hover below its 200-day moving average, currently $355. At Thursday's close of $326, it's testing a key long-term support level seen back in September 2024 and April 2025. 

The company's mNAV premium has compressed to below 1.5x when accounting for outstanding convertible debt and preferred stock, or roughly 1.3x based solely on equity value.

Preferred stock issuance remains muted, with only $17 million tapped across STRK and STRF this week, meaning that the bulk of at-the-money issuance is still flowing through common shares. According to the company, options are now listed and trading for all four perpetual preferred stocks, a development that could provide additional yield on the dividend.

The CME's FedWatch tool shows traders expect a 25 basis-point U.S. interest-rate cut in September and have priced in a total of three rate cuts by year-end. 

That's a sign risk sentiment could tilt back toward growth and crypto-linked equities, underlined by the 10-year U.S. Treasury briefly breaking below 4% this week.

Still, the dollar index (DXY) continues to hold multiyear support, a potential inflection point worth watching.

Ethereum is about to drop this huge privacy overhaul. It's gonna shake things up for DeFi and crypto-friendly businesses in a big way. The Ethereum Foundation's PSE (Privacy Stewards of Ethereum) are working on this, and they're set to implement some serious privacy features. Sounds good, right? But then there's that nagging question: are we about to give a free pass to bad actors? And, of course, will regulators start to come down harder on us?

The Ethereum Foundation is rebranding its specialized division to the Privacy Stewards of Ethereum (PSE). This is a clear message that they're going all out on privacy features across the board. We're talking about everything from core protocols to wallet systems. They're aiming to roll out some measurable goals in the next 3 to 6 months, including private transactions through PlasmaFold, a new layer-2 solution. 

And there's more. They want to implement anonymous voting and up privacy protocols for decentralized finance platforms. They're even looking to protect the personal information that RPC services handle. Sounds fancy, right? But it does open up the door for illicit activities.

Let's break down what this could mean. On the one hand, these features could offer solid protection for user data and keep transactions under wraps. But on the other hand, we might be inviting a world of trouble. Illicit activities could easily rise, which would mean regulators are gonna be watching us like hawks. And for crypto-friendly businesses, that's a tough spot to be in.

In Asia, where laws are still catching up, businesses will need to be on their toes. Yes, these privacy features can offer a layer of protection, but they could also complicate compliance. The good part? Zero-knowledge proofs and other cryptographic methods could help businesses verify compliance without giving away too much information.

As this unfolds, it's not just about compliance; it's also about ethics. Blockchain is all about transparency, right? But that transparency can clash with our privacy rights. Transaction histories can sometimes be deanonymized, which is a problem. Plus, the immutable nature of blockchain records goes against privacy laws like GDPR. Imagine trying to remove sensitive data that can't be altered on-chain!

And then there's the crypto payroll angle. The future of crypto payroll systems could see a boost from these privacy features, but businesses will still have to navigate the tricky regulatory landscape. The rise of Web3 banking and decentralized payroll tools is probably inevitable as companies look to utilize privacy-enhancing technologies while staying compliant.

To sum it up, Ethereum's privacy overhaul is a double-edged sword. It could up security and confidentiality, but also complicate compliance and ethical considerations. Crypto businesses will have to find that sweet spot between privacy and regulatory obligations as the market evolves.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Bitcoin weakens, altcoins build strength for next market rally","https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-weakens-altcoins-build-strength-for-next-market-rally-what-else/","Sun, 14 Sep 2025 13:07:30 GMT","

Not all altcoins will thrive this season. Investors must rely on due diligence and conviction for survival.



The decline in Bitcoin Dominance and the rise in altcoin market cap indicated a strengthening of the altcoin market. Treasury inflows and ETF buzz fueled bullish sentiment in majors.

Long-term holder confidence in Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] grew, as large withdrawals of BTC and ETH left exchanges.

Such withdrawals generally indicate an intent to hold the assets long-term and denote market confidence.



Source: BTC.D on TradingView

Bitcoin Dominance fell below the 58.1% mark. The cyan box highlighted a key support/resistance from 2020-21 for BTC.D.

A drop below this support was a positive development for the altcoin market, as it showed capital flow was directed outside Bitcoin.

Source: TOTAL3 on TradingView

The TOTAL3 metric, which tracks crypto market capitalization excluding BTC and ETH, approached a weekly close above $1.13 trillion.

This level was first reached in November 2021 and retested in December 2024, but the price failed to close above it then, showing the significance of the level.

Hence, a weekly session close above this key level would be a sign of bullish strength in the altcoin market.

It does not point to an imminent full-blown altcoin season. Rather, it showed that there was a high chance of altcoins seeing large gains in the coming months.

By the way, it should be noted that not all altcoins are guaranteed to perform well.

Select altcoins will benefit more from an alt season than their peers.

Among the large-cap altcoins, Solana [SOL] has already witnessed growing treasury plays from institutions. Moreover, Ethereum saw rising interest from institutions in June and July.

For instance, the largest holders, such as BitMine and SharpLink, have added over a million ETH to their treasuries in the past month.

Similarly, SOL saw strong treasury accumulation over the past month as well, with over 2.6 million SOL bought.

The Dogecoin ETF, which has been delayed to next week, saw DOGE prices break past the local resistance at $0.25 and challenge the $0.3 level. Hype around the ETF could spark wider gains for memecoins.

Finally, a potential September rate cut may lift risk assets, starting with Bitcoin. That shift could extend bullish sentiment into the altcoin market.

Polymarket launching instant Bitcoin prediction markets is a game changer in the crypto world. With Chainlink's oracle technology now in the mix, it brings a whole new level of reliability and efficiency to the table. Real-time settlements? That's a big deal. It's set to change how we trade, and honestly, it might boost trading volumes and liquidity quite a bit. Let's dive into how this all works and what it means for investors.

Blockchain payments are at the core of Polymarket's instant Bitcoin prediction markets. They're using smart contracts to make sure everything is executed smoothly and securely. No need for middlemen; that cuts down on counterparty risk and makes users a bit more comfortable. Plus, instant settlements are crucial when every second can impact profitability.

By teaming up with Chainlink, Polymarket is adding a solid layer of reliability to prediction markets. Chainlink's decentralized oracle tech provides data feeds that make market resolutions more accurate. Because of this integration, Polymarket can settle trades within 15 minutes, which is a game changer. Increased user confidence and participation? Yes, please. This makes the trading environment more dynamic and could attract even more people, increasing liquidity.

Decentralized oracles play a vital role in making sure market outcomes are legit. Chainlink pulls data from various sources, reducing the risks of relying on just one. This enhances the accuracy of predictions and ensures that market resolutions are based on real-world data. For fintech startups, adopting similar decentralized oracle solutions could significantly enhance the reliability of their crypto business payout systems.

The success of these prediction markets hinges on user engagement. Polymarket's model taps into collective insights, making short-term predictions more accurate. This active participation boosts market liquidity and the overall reliability of predictions. Fintech startups should focus on building platforms that encourage user involvement to drive better market outcomes.

However, instant settlements come with their own set of regulatory hurdles. They require trades to be fully funded upfront, which could limit flexibility. Plus, fast transactions could complicate fraud detection and compliance with AML regulations. Fintech startups will need to navigate these challenges to ensure they grow sustainably.

Integrating Chainlink's oracle tech into Polymarket's instant Bitcoin prediction markets is a significant step in the crypto space. By boosting market reliability and efficiency, this could usher in a new era of trading dynamics. As blockchain payments and decentralized oracles gain traction, we could see improved user trust and increased trading volumes. Fintech startups will need to adopt these technologies to stay ahead in the fast-evolving landscape of crypto business and payroll systems. The future of prediction markets is bright, possibly reshaping how we engage with financial predictions and transactions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","How is Somnia Set to Transform Crypto Payroll for Businesses?","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/somnia-blockchain-crypto-payroll-smes","Sun, 14 Sep 2025 17:31:55 GMT","

I've recently come across Somnia, a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain, and its potential role in reshaping the crypto payroll sector, especially for businesses. It's intriguing to see how it aims to handle applications requiring real-time and high-volume transactions like gaming and social platforms while claiming to process upwards of one million transactions per second. Such claims, if substantiated, could indeed place it as a leading contender in the blockchain arena.

Its architecture is designed to be completely EVM-compatible. This means that developers can deploy existing Ethereum tools and contracts with minimal changes, which is an essential consideration for any business wanting to venture into blockchain without a complete overhaul of their systems.

Somnia employs cutting-edge technologies to bolster its performance, making it potentially suitable for crypto payroll systems:

Accelerated Sequential Execution: This is a fancy way of saying that rather than executing contracts step-by-step, contracts are compiled into optimized machine code for near-native execution speeds. Imagine processing millions of transfers in just fractions of a second.

IceDB: The data generated from transactions could be overwhelming, but thanks to IceDB, a high-speed database that operates in nanoseconds, it can maintain peak performance.

MultiStream Consensus: This mechanism is something to note—it allows validators to maintain their own transaction data chains while a separate chain organizes these transactions securely. This could very well enhance both transaction throughput and security.

Advanced Compression: With millions of transactions in play, bandwidth could be a concern. Somnia utilizes advanced compression techniques to reduce bandwidth usage while maintaining throughput.

What's the potential impact of Somnia's blockchain technology on crypto payroll for small and medium enterprises (SMEs)? It does seem like it could revolutionize how they manage payroll, thanks to its high transaction speeds and EVM compatibility.

If one were to summarize the advantages, it might look something like this:

Speed: With a claimed 1M TPS, payroll could be issued in real-time. This is a boon for businesses with remote teams or operations across borders.

Cost-Efficiency: Reducing transaction costs by 40-60% in comparison to traditional banking methods could seriously help SMEs improve their margins.

Talent Attraction: Offering crypto payroll could help attract tech-savvy employees who appreciate cutting-edge payment options.

Stablecoin Use: By using stablecoins pegged to fiat, the volatility often tied to cryptocurrencies could be mitigated. This would ensure that employees receive stable salaries, irrespective of market fluctuations.

Automation: The architecture offers support for automated, recurring payments, which would further simplify payroll processing.

Nonetheless, even with these benefits, several challenges could arise for SMEs:

Regulatory Compliance: The regulatory landscape is still evolving and can be tricky to navigate. Adding a layer of compliance to crypto payroll systems may introduce complexity.

Decentralization Concerns: The decentralized nature of the blockchain can evoke trust and governance issues among users.

Technical Expertise Needed: Moving to a new payroll system requires a certain level of technical knowledge, which could necessitate investment in training or new hires.

Market Concerns: Even with stablecoin usage, broader cryptocurrency market volatility could pose a risk.

One of the design features of Somnia appears to be its built-in compliance capabilities. Its transparent and auditable transactions could help SMEs align their payroll systems with regulations:

Transparent Transactions: All transactions recorded on the blockchain can be audited, which is vital for meeting regulatory scrutiny.

Adaptability: A system that adapts to regulatory changes could help SMEs remain compliant easily.

Stablecoin Support: Facilitating stablecoin transactions may help ensure stable and compliant financial practices.

Lastly, some future trends to consider as the crypto payroll landscape evolves:

Stablecoin Adoption: Expect to see increased use of stablecoins for payroll.

Integration with Traditional Banks: It could become more common for crypto payroll platforms to work with traditional banks.

Regulatory Frameworks: As regulations solidify, compliance should become easier for SMEs.

Decentralized Tools' Expansion: The rise of DeFi could lead to more payroll solutions leveraging blockchain technology.

Financial Inclusion: These systems could assist underbanked populations in gaining access to financial services.

To wrap up, Somnia's blockchain technology might present an opportunity for SMEs to modernize payroll systems by capitalizing on speed, efficiency, and compliance capabilities. The integration of blockchain payroll solutions could end up being significant in shaping the future of business banking, but skepticism remains.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","ETH/BTC ratio remains below 0.05 despite institutional adoption and ATH","https://cointelegraph.com/news/eth-btc-ratio-below-0-05-despite-rally-institutional-adoption","Sun, 14 Sep 2025 18:43:30 GMT","

 The ratio compares the price of ETH to BTC; a higher ratio indicates ETH is gaining strength against BTC, while a lower ratio signals weak ETH. 

The Ether-Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) ratio, which measures the price of Ether (ETH) against the price of Bitcoin (BTC), has failed to reclaim 0.05, despite adoption of ETH by institutions and the historic price rally in July and August that took ETH to new all-time highs.

ETH/BTC has remained below the 0.05 level since July 2024, and the ratio peaked in June 2017 when it hit the all-time high of 0.14, according to CoinGecko. The ratio current sits at 0.039, down from the 0.04 reached in August.

The ratio fell to a 5-year low in March, collapsing to 0.02, amid macroeconomic uncertainty and rising trade tensions between the United States and its trading partners. 

However, the cryptocurrency market recovered, rallying to new highs in the ensuing months. Ether's price hit a series of highs in August, reaching an all-time high of $4,957 on August 24, before dropping by about 6.7% to the current price level.

The price of Ether has rallied by about 155% since July, as financial institutions adopt the token for treasury purposes, traditional equity investors purchase ETH through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and the Ethereum Foundation pitches the network to Wall Street.

Ether has outperformed BTC only 15% of the time since its launch in 2015, according to market analyst James Check.

Check's data shows that the majority of ETH's outperformance occurred between 2015 and 2017, in the wake of the launch of the world's first smart contract blockchain platform and the initial coin offering (ICO) boom of 2017.

However, since 2020, BTC has outperformed ETH, according to a price history analysis shared by Check in April.

Market analysts are forecasting when Ethereum will reach the $5,000 milestone, which it narrowly missed in August by about $43 before retracing to current levels.

“With ETH near its previous ATHs, we may consolidate for a bit, given the very large run-up in such a short time frame,” Jake Kennis, an analyst at blockchain analytics and research company Nansen, told Cointelegraph during the August rally.

The analyst said that it may take weeks or months for ETH to hit new all-time highs following the heated price rally in August.

Bret Taylor, board chair at OpenAI and CEO of AI agent startup Sierra, was asked in a recent interview with The Verge whether he agreed with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's declaration that “someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money in AI.”

Taylor echoed Altman's sentiments, suggesting that we are indeed in an AI bubble — but like Altman, he didn't sound too worried about it.

“I think it is both true that AI will transform the economy, and I think it will, like the internet, create huge amounts of economic value in the future,” Taylor said. “I think we're also in a bubble, and a lot of people will lose a lot of money. I think both are absolutely true at the same time, and there's a lot of historical precedent for both of those things being true at the same time.”

Specifically, Taylor compared today's AI landscape to the dot-com bubble of the late ‘90s. While many companies failed when the bubble burst, he argued that “all the people in 1999 were kind of right.”

AI-powered chatbots play a growing role in spiritual life, according to a New York Times story that examines the popularity of religious chatbots and apps.

The Times notes that an app called Bible Chat has been downloaded more than 30 million times, while another app, Hallow, reached the number one spot in Apple's App Store last year.

For the most part, these apps are supposed to point people to religious doctrine and scripture to answer their questions, although at least one website purports to allow users to chat with God. Rabbi Jonathan Roman suggested chatbots could be a “way into faith” for “a whole generation of people who have never been to a church or synagogue.”

However, these chatbots are built on top of AI models that are designed to validate users' opinions, to the point that they can reinforce delusional or conspiratorial thinking. Heidi Campbell, a Texas A&M professor who studies the intersection of digital culture and religion, warned that chatbots “tell us what we want to hear.”

“It's not using spiritual discernment, it is using data and patterns,” Campbell said.

Unexpectedly becoming the sole caregiver of an aging parent seems different to me.

Prime Video's been feeding superhero audiences with The Boys and its Gen V spinoff, but the franchise has other shows in the works. Up on the docket is one set in Mexico that's gone quiet since the initial reveal back in 2023.

But according to Boys showrunner Eric Kripke, that series remains alive and kicking. In a recent Collider talk, he promised the show is in active development and is “very cool. […] I think the script is good, and the world itself meets the standard of all our spinoffs.” He further teased it as offering something different from the usual proceedings found in its siblings shows: “It's our world, but a totally different tone, and it's super fun. Gael [Garcia Bernal] and Diego [Luna] are executive producers, which is amazing and [they're] really engaged with it.”

Kripke's previously talked about his aims of keeping The Boys franchise alive without making it the butt of its own jokes. They're using other franchises at reference points, observing the places where they've failed and succeeded, and ensuring any extension covers territory the other shows can't: the general plot of The Boys: Mexico is right there in the title, while Gen V is set in a superhero college and the upcoming Vought Rising is a prequel set in the 1950s. As for Kripke's mention of Mexico having a “totally diffferent” tone, we'll have to wait and see what that means.

While we wait to hear more about The Boys: Mexico, we have Gen V coming back on September 17, followed by the final season of The Boys in 2026 and Vought Rising presumably sometime that same year.

It's floating!


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Cougar just released the CFV235 and CFV235 Mesh, a mid-tower PC case design that features a unique “Central Floating Ventilation” structure that physically separates your motherboard, CPU, and GPU from the PSU and SATA storage drives. According to ComputerBase, the gap between these two sections allows for 270 degrees of airflow, allowing the main compartment access to fresh air from four sides. With a setup like this, PC builders can ensure that both the CPU and GPU get cooler outside air for optimal cooling performance.

 




Aside from this, Cougar thought about dust settling into the crevice between the two compartments, so it added magnetic dust filters at both the roof and the base of the Central Floating Ventilation structure. This can make cleaning so much easier, and you don't have to worry about using a powerful blower to get dust off its surfaces and billowing into your room. This case also comes with a single 120mm ARGB PWM fan at the rear and either a Unity 240 ARGB PWM Reversed fan on the motherboard side for the version with the glass front, or two 160mm ARGB PWM fans mounted in front for the mesh version.

You also get an Aurora LED Strip you can easily mount on the roof of the gap, highlighting the special feature of your PC case. And if that is not bling enough for you, you can get the Vision upgrade, which adds a 9.16-inch LCD monitor with a 1920 x 462 resolution at the side of the lower compartment.

For cooling support, you can mount three 120mm fans at the bottom part of the main compartment, and either two 140mm fans or three 120mm fans at the top area, aside from the fans that are included from the factory. Alternatively, you can install a top-mounted AIO radiator up to 360mm and a 120mm one on the rear. Of course, you should avoid installing a radiator at the bottom, as air bubbles can form on your AIO cooler's motor, leading to premature failure.

Aside from all these cooling options, this case is also compatible with reverse-connector (BTF) motherboards, it supports GPUs up to 400mm long, and up to four 2.5-inch drives (or two 3.5-inch and two 2.5-inch storage drives). Of course, you might think that a cantilever design like this might not be as strong as the usual rectangular box PC case layout. But its 1.5-mm-thick frame should ensure that the chassis won't bend.

The cases are available in black or white, with ComputerBase saying that the models start at $139 for the cheaper option with the glass display, and $10 more for the mesh variant. And if you want to add a small screen near the base of the case, you must add $89, bringing the total max price to $238 if you order a case with all the bells and whistles.

Bayern Munich will start their bid for a seventh UEFA Champions League/European Cup trophy with a home match against FIFA Club World Cup champions Chelsea on Wednesday (kick-off: 9.00pm CEST).



 5 reasons why Bayern will beat Chelsea!

Bayern's impressive start to the campaign showed no signs of slowing down as they made it three Bundesliga wins from three in their 5-0 thrashing of Hamburg on Matchday 3. The Bavarians also won their DFB Cup first-round match and defeated VfB Stuttgart to win the Franz Beckenbauer Supercup.

While Michael Olise and new signing Luis Díaz have impressed in the season's early weeks, Harry Kane remains Bayern's star man, netting a brace versus HSV to take his 2025/26 tally to eight goals.

He will lead the line once more here, with Nicolas Jackson ready to pounce against his parent club should he be required.

Bayern are still without Jamal Musiala and Alphonso Davies, but otherwise Vincent Kompany will have a full squad to choose from.

As such, midfielder Tom Bischof could make his UEFA Champions League bow, whether selected from the start or from the bench, while defender Jonathan Tah is expected to play his first game in the competition for his new club.





Chelsea head to Munich, having followed up their Club World Cup win with an unbeaten start to the English Premier League campaign, although they missed the chance to move second in the table as they conceded deep into injury time in their 2-2 draw with Brentford at the weekend.

Cole Palmer came on from the bench and scored in that one after recovering from injury and should play from the off in the Bavarian capital.

João Pedro has arguably been his team's leading player in the season's opening weeks, scoring twice and providing three assists.

Bayern will also come up against a familiar face in Jamie Gittens, who moved to London from Borussia Dortmund in the summer.

The English punk-rap duo appeared to mock the late Kirk and repeated calls against the IDF during an Amsterdam show on Saturday night.


							By 

	Jackie Strause


Managing Editor, East Coast


	English punk-rap duo Bob Vylan appeared to celebrate the assassination of Charlie Kirk during their Amsterdam performance at Club Paradiso on Saturday.


	In videos captured by concertgoers and shared across social media, the group's frontman Bobby Vylan (a stage name for Pascal Robinson-Foster; drummer Bobbie Vylan is the other half of the group) told a cheering crowd, “I want to dedicate this next one to an absolute piece of shit of a human being. The pronouns was/were. [Because] if you talk shit, you will get banged. Rest in piss Charlie Kirk, you piece of shit.”

	Their comments in Amsterdam came only days after Kirk was assassinated on Sept. 10. The conservative activist and leader of Turning Point USA was shot and killed while speaking during an event at Utah Valley University hosted by his nonprofit political organization. The Trump ally was fatally struck in the neck by an assassin's bullet while discussing mass shootings in the United States.

	The frontman also repeated calls against the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and encouraged violence against “fascists and Zionists,” per social media accounts. Hanan Herzberger, chairman of the Central Jewish Council of the Netherlands, said in a statement, “The singer Bob Vylan's call from the stage, ‘Go hunt them in the streets' is nothing but a call for another pogrom in Amsterdam, like the one we saw last year.”

	











	Bob Vylan garnered backlash earlier this summer over “death to the IDF” chants during their set at Glastonbury, one of the most famous music festivals in the world, that was also broadcast on the BBC. Glastonbury condemned the chant, UTA subsequently dropped Bob Vylan and the U.S. State Department revoked their visas, putting their upcoming North American tour in jeopardy. 


	The BBC also shared a statement saying the network regretted livestreaming their Glastonbury set, stating “the antisemitic sentiments expressed by Bob Vylan were utterly unacceptable and have no place on our airwaves.”


	Of the Glastonbury backlash, Bob Vylan said the duo “are not the story” and argued that they were “being targeted for speaking up.”


	At the Club Paradiso venue on Saturday, a Palestinian flag was draped on stage, and the duo shared videos of a post-show protest on their Instagram page.


	In a statement shared on its website, Club Paradiso said, “On Saturday, September 13, during his performance at Paradiso, artist Bob Vylan made statements that many experienced as harsh and offensive. Paradiso believes in the power of artistic freedom. Music, and punk in particular, has traditionally been a form of art that amplifies anger, discontent, and injustice without filter. In a world on fire, artists sometimes choose language that sounds confrontational or violent. That is part of artistic expression, but not automatically language that we as a venue endorse.”

	











	The statement continued, “Paradiso shares the outrage and concern regarding the genocidal violence taking place in Gaza. That Bob Vylan raises his voice against it is legitimate and necessary. Should the Openbaar Ministerie (public prosecution service) wish to investigate whether any criminal offenses have been committed, Paradiso will cooperate.”

	The soundtrack to Netflix's animated film KPop Demon Hunters hits No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart for the first time, rising 2-1 on the chart dated Sept. 20, after seven nonconsecutive weeks in the runner-up slot. The set earned 128,000 equivalent album units in the United States in the week ending Sept. 11 (up 7%), according to Luminate, marking the album's best week yet. The surge to No. 1 follows the album's deluxe reissue on Sept. 5 with additional tracks, plus the wide release of its CD that day.

	











KPop Demon Hunters' rise to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 was preceded by four top 10-charted hits on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart — the most from a soundtrack in nearly 30 years, with the soundtrack the first ever with four simultaneous top 10s. Among those is the No. 1 “Golden” by HUNTR/X — the trio of EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI (the singing voices of the film's characters Rumi, Mira and Zoey).

KPop Demon Hunters is the Billboard 200's first No. 1 soundtrack in three-and-a-half years, since another animated film, Encanto, saw its companion album spend nine nonconsecutive weeks on top (Jan. 15-March 19, 2022).


	Notably, as KPop Demon Hunters climbs to No. 1 in its 12th week on the chart, it completes the longest wait to reach No. 1 since Toby Keith's 2008 release 35 Biggest Hits re-entered the chart at No. 1 on the Feb. 17, 2024-dated list, following his death that Feb. 5. The last album with a longer continuous climb to No. 1 than KPop Demon Hunters was The Kid LAROI's F*ck Love, which jumped 26-1 in its 53rd consecutive chart week, on the Aug. 7, 2021, list. The latter vaulted to No. 1 following two reissues during that tracking week.

	











	Meawhile, the last soundtrack to take a longer journey to No. 1 was O Brother, Where Art Thou?, which rose 2-1 in its 63rd continuous week on the chart, on the March 23, 2002-dated list. Its ascent to the top was aided by its Grammy Award win for album of the year at the 44th annual ceremony that Feb. 27.


	Plus, KPop Demon Hunters spent seven nonconsecutive weeks at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 before reaching No. 1. That's the longest wait an album endured in the runner-up spot before leading the Billboard 200 in nearly a half-century: In October-November 1977, Linda Ronstadt's Simple Dreams logged nine weeks at No. 2 before topping the chart at last. (Stray Cats' Built for Speed holds the record for the most weeks peaking at No. 2: 15 in 1982-83.)


	Also in the top 10 of the latest Billboard 200: Justin Bieber's SWAG vaults 17-4 following its deluxe expansion with 23 additional tracks, and sombr's I Barely Know Her reaches the top 10 for the first time, rising 12-10 in its third week, following the artist's performance on the MTV Video Music Awards (Sept. 7).


	The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new Sept. 20, 2025-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on Sept. 16. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.

	











	Of KPop Demon Hunters' 128,000 equivalent album units earned in the latest tracking week, SEA units comprise 103,000 (up less than 1%, equaling 141.08 million on-demand official streams of the set's tracks — it rises 2-1 on Top Streaming Albums for its first week on top), album sales comprise 23,000 (up 56%; it's pushed down 3-4 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise 2,000 (down 7%).


	In the tracking week, the soundtrack got a boost from its deluxe reissue as a digital download and streaming album on Sept. 5 with 23 additional tracks. The additional cuts are mostly sing-along, instrumental and a cappella versions of the album's hit songs. The album's sales gain was aided by the wide release of its standard 12-track CD to brick-and-mortar retailers. It is available in five CD variants, each containing a poster and randomized photocard. A vinyl release for the project is expected Oct. 17.


KPop Demon Hunters premiered on June 20 in a limited theatrical release in the U.S. (in three movie theaters), and on Netflix, alongside its soundtrack. The film returned to theaters, this time nationwide, for a limited engagement on Aug. 23-24 as a sing-along version. The same sing-along version hit Netflix on Aug. 25.


	In the tracking week ending Sept. 7, the animated film was No. 2 in its 12th week on Netflix's Top 10 Movies in United States chart, with four of those weeks at No. 1. The movie now stands as the most popular original Netflix film to date.


KPop Demon Hunters is the seventh animated film soundtrack to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200, since the list began publishing on a regular weekly basis in March 1956. It follows Encanto (nine weeks at No. 1, 2022), Frozen II (one week, 2019), Frozen (13, 2014), Jack Johnson's Curious George (one, 2006), Pocahontas (one, 1995) and The Lion King (10, 1994-95).

	











KPop Demon Hunters ends a dry spell for soundtracks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. It's been three years and six months since Encanto spent its ninth and final week atop the list (dated March 19, 2022). That's the longest the chart has gone without a soundtrack at No. 1 since the three-year and nearly eight-month gap between the second and final week at No. 1 for Armageddon (July 25, 1998) and the first of two weeks at No. 1 for O Brother, Where Art Thou? (March 23, 2002).


	Back on the latest Billboard 200, Sabrina Carpenter's Man's Best Friend falls to No. 2 with 119,000 equivalent album units earned (down 68%) after debuting at No. 1 a week ago. Morgan Wallen's chart-topping I'm the Problem is a non-mover at No. 3 with 98,000 (down 6%).


	Justin Bieber's SWAG surges 17-4 with 80,000 equivalent album units (up 223%) after it was surprise reissued in a deluxe edition as a digital download and streaming album on Sept. 5 with 23 additional tracks. The deluxe edition is dubbed SWAG II and contains the original SWAG album's 21 tracks, along with an additional 23 bonus tracks. The original SWAG album was also a surprise affair, arriving on July 11 with little notice; it debuted at its No. 2 best. All versions of SWAG are combined for tracking and charting purposes.


SWAG also gets an assist from the release of the standard 21-track album's release on CD and via two deluxe CD boxed sets (each containing a branded T-shirt and a copy of the standard SWAG album).


	Alex Warren's You'll Be Alright, Kid is a non-mover at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 with 38,000 equivalent album units earned (up less than 1%). SZA's chart-topping SOS climbs 9-6 (just over 33,000, down 2%), Wallen's former leader One Thing at a Time dips 6-7 (33,000, down 6%), Stray Kids' chart-topping KARMA falls 4-8 (32,000, down 49%), and Gunna's The Last Wun falls 8-9 (31,000, down 10%).

	











	Closing out the top 10 is sombr's debut studio album I Barely Know Her, which rises 12-10 in its third week on the chart — and its first week in the top 10. The set earned 29,000 equivalent album units in the latest tracking week (up 5%). The rise comes after sombr performed a medley of the album's “Back to Friends” and “12 to 12” on the MTV Video Music Awards broadcast on CBS on Sept. 7. Prior to the album's ascent to the top 10, its singles “Back to Friends” and “Undressed” both hit the top 30 of the Hot 100 and the top 20 of the all-genre Streaming Songs chart.

Video footage of the argument shows Bryan attempting to jump a fence to confront Adcock.

	Mitchell Peters



Zach Bryan and Gavin Adcock were involved in a heated confrontation that nearly turned physical at the Born & Raised Festival in Pryor, Oklahoma.


	On Saturday (Sept. 13), the two country artists were caught on camera in a verbal altercation just moments before Adcock, 26, was scheduled to perform at the event.


	A video clip, shared on Instagram by Adcock, shows the singers arguing from opposite sides of a chain-link fence.

	











	“Hey, do you want to fight like a man? Come open the gate,” Bryan, 29, is heard saying before angrily shoving the fence.


	“When you get death threats from Sack Cryin before you headline in his hometown,” Adcock wrote over the short clip, using a mocking nickname for Bryan. He captioned the post, “Eat a snickers bro.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	In another video posted to Facebook, Bryan is seen climbing over the barbed-wire-topped fence and lunging toward Adcock before being restrained by security. Adcock is shown walking away while escorted by a guard.


	Adcock faced criticism in the comments section, with one user writing, “He scaled a barbed wire fence … and you didn't do s—t and hid behind security … this lil clip ain't fooling anybody.” Adcock responded, “Had a show to play for Oklahoma. Wasn't going to jail over that Psycho,” according to Penn Live.


Billboard has reached out to representatives for both Bryan and Adcock for comment.

	











	The confrontation appears to be the latest chapter in an ongoing feud between the two country singers, which began earlier this summer.


	In mid-July, Adcock seemed to throw shade at Bryan over an interaction involving a 14-year-old fan who was disappointed after not receiving an autograph from the “I Remember Everything” singer. In a since-deleted TikTok comment following the second night of Bryan's three-show run at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, Bryan wrote, “You're not entitled after someone plays two and a half hours to a picture or a hello,” adding the NSFW acronym “GOMD.”


	Adcock later responded on X, criticizing Bryan's handling of the situation. “If you can't handle the criticism of a 14 year old why do people idolize you?” he wrote. “That kid was head over heels to meet you and spent/ parents spent a ton of money to see you. He's got feeling too and a you're a ‘grown man' nearly 30. They're the only reason you are around.”


	Adcock expanded on his criticism during an appearance on Rolling Stone's Nashville Now podcast.


	“It wasn't about not wanting to sign autographs after a show, it's like letting a 14-year-old kid rant, without saying, ‘get off my d—k.' You're bigger than that,” he said. “I think Zach Bryan puts on a big mask in his day-to-day life and sometimes he can't help but rip it off and show his true colors,” he said, without elaborating on what those “true colors” might be.


	Despite the public feud, Adcock admitted he has never met Bryan. “I wouldn't say Zach Bryan is my buddy,” he told the podcast. “I ain't his buddy, he ain't my buddy. I ain't met the guy. I don't need him.”

International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor


EXCLUSIVE: Celine Song's Materialists has crossed the $100M mark globally, with $101.3M through today. Of that, $64.8M is from the international box office. Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions boarded offshore rights on the A24 original out of the 2024 European Film Market in Berlin, and staggered overseas release from June through September this summer, cranking out strong numbers and holds along the way. Materialists is the No. 1 romantic drama of the year globally, and the No. 2 romance film for 2025 behind Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy.


	Savvy marketing and promotional activations; fun input from the cast of Dakota Johnson, Chris Evans and Pedro Pascal; and hitting a sweet spot for an underserved audience all contributed to the success of the estimated $20M budgeted film which put a twist on the genre. The importance of getting a movie in this space this to $100M+ worldwide is clear: The industry needs fresh fare that entices audiences in terms of concept, but also discourse in its wake.

Materialists was the No. 3 biggest domestic opener for A24 when it bowed on June 13, and is now the indie's 7th highest grosser domestically (in Puerto Rico, it became the studio's biggest release ever) and its 3rd biggest worldwide, with Sony powering offshore.


	Sony has for several years found a niche in female-centric films, including post-pandemic titles like 2024's It Ends With Us, the biggest romantic drama since 2018; Anyone But You (2023), the highest grossing R-rated romantic comedy globally since 2016; and summer 2022's Where the Crawdads Sing.


Materialists, which sees Johnson as Lucy, an ambitious New York City matchmaker who finds herself torn between the perfect match John (Pascal) and her imperfect ex Harry (Evans), is the latest in Sony's international success stories. So, how did it happen?


	Sony began rollout in in Australia, New Zealand, Netherlands and Poland in early June, lockstep with A24's domestic release. Sony later added France, Brazil and Mexico in July. Notable August releases included Korea, UK, Spain and Germany with Italy rounding out the overseas footprint earlier this month.

	











	The Top 5 offshore markets through today are: Germany ($5.4M), UK ($5.2M), Mexico ($5M), Australia ($4.7M) and Spain ($4.1M).


	Bringing a fresh perspective to the romantic comedy/drama, the movie resonated with a new generation while also attracting older females and sparking cultural conversation about modern dating and relationships. 


	Johnson, Evans and Pascal participated in numerous interviews, including Johnson's appearance on Hot Ones and a Vogue Rapid Fire with Johnson and Pascal. Social video of them “kissing” went viral.


	Internationally, Sony capitalized on talent (over 10 hours of interviews), and partnerships with high-fashion outlets like Elle Greece and Harper's Bazaar Korea. Song traveled to Paris (Champs-Elysées Film Festival), Mallorca (Atlàntida Mallorca Film Fest) and the UK. 


	Johnson attended the Karlovy Vary Film Festival in July (both for Materialists and Splitsville). Earlier, in May, she made her first trip to the Cannes Film Festival, already speaking to Deadline about the movie.


	Around the world, Sony's marketing team implemented “Global Girls' Night” and influencer screening programs, in addition to stunted screenings like “Match-making Screenings” (Taiwan), speed dating events (Sweden, Colombia, Finland) and Team Chris/Team Pedro screening battles (Brazil).


	There were also collaborations with influencers, targeting young females across TikTok, META and YouTube. The studio worked with 46 bespoke international influencers to create content, and amplified those spots globally in bursts.


	Local highlights included in Mexico with Pinky Promise TV  where creators asked passersby relationship-centric questions. In MENA, couple creators The Rahals created a scene-insertion video; and in France couple creators Camiso & Kassandra discussed red and green flags in relationships.


	Custom TikTok spots were fashioned to capitalize on cultural moments and trending topics, constantly pushing relevance. For example: “Four Fantastic Reasons to see Materialists” spots when Pascal was deep into his promotional tour for The Fantastic Four: First Steps.


	Netherlands further collaborated with renowned fashion designer, Claes Iversen, who designed a dress for Loiza Lamers (winner of Holland's Next Top Model), inspired by Lucy's blue dress in Materialists. Together they attended The Young Patrons Gala from the National Opera & Ballet Netherlands, where they debuted the gown.


Materialists is written and directed by Song. David Hinojosa, Christine Vachon, Pamela Koffler and Song served as producers, with Taylor Shung, Len Blavatnik, Danny Cohen, Timo Argillander and Andrea Scarso exec producing.

Wow. Amazing success overseas.
Good for film, it deserves to win.
28 Years Later was the best summer film this year. Should have done more business, but still a great film.

It's back to basics, GOOD SCRIPTS!  Good scripts don't need a 200M budget to make so don't have to make $500M+ to breakeven.   Great actors will work for less then their quote if the script is great!  AI can't make great scripts.   Invest in writers! (and I'm an actor!)

Well said!

Its a good film, I'm very happy for its success, for those involved, but also for what a hit like this means for the health of the industry as a whole.
We need these wins, great work from everyone involved.

	One month before Charlie Kirk‘s death, Tucker Carlson released an interview with the right-wing activist where the two spoke about how economic anxiety and debt has become a major issue for young and millennial adults in America, comparing Donald Trump‘s 2016 appeal with economically disenfranchised young voters to Zohran Mamdani‘s rising popularity among young New Yorkers.


	“The Muslim communist that is running for mayor in New York City… He looks like he's from central casting, his ideas are terrible, he wants the city to run the grocery stores,” Kirk said in the clip surfaced by Spencer Hakimian on X, formerly Twitter. Mamdani is a self-described democratic socialist, not a communist, and he has proposed five city-run grocery stores, one in each borough, to help New Yorkers afford food. 


	“This is yet another distress signal by young people to say, ‘Hey, if you're not gonna fix our life economically, we're gonna get very radical politically,” Kirk told Carlson.

This is Charlie Kirk's final interview with Tucker Carlson.He makes a point about the similarities in appeal between Donald Trump and Zohran Mamdani.  pic.twitter.com/mx50a8kChp


	“Let's take a step back,” Kirk said. “President Trump won the youth vote… in many battleground states. Now, Tucker, 12-13 years ago, when I started Turning Point, if you would have told me that a Republican running for the presidency would be winning the youth vote in Michigan and in Arizona, I'd say, ‘No way.' … One of the reasons he was able to win younger voters, and younger men, especially, in big numbers, is they were trying to get their leaders' attention… Donald Trump was a distress signal by a lot of young people, especially a lot of young men, that were stuck in a credit-centric renter economy.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	He then called Mamdani “just another iteration of this, only from the left.”

	











	Kirk then pointed out that it is harder than ever for young people to buy a home, and D.C. politicians he speaks to — likely those on the right — are disconnected from this issue.


	“The purchasing power of every generation is getting weaker,” Kirk said.

	The two conservative provocateurs continued their nearly two-hour conversation, which covered controversial topics near and dear to the far right, such as the so-called “Deep State,” immigration, the “power” of young white men in this country, and the “hyper-feminization” of the workforce (a boogeyman phrase to describe women's increased participation in the labor economy, something Kirk decried just two days before his death, saying young women “don't value having children” and are prioritizing their careers, causing “a fertility collapse in the west”). But when it comes to the economic situation many young adults face, Kirk was correct that purchasing power is decreasing while prices and interest rates are rising, making housing increasingly unaffordable, and young voters are attracted to candidates who promise to address those issues.


	The age — and price — at which buyers purchase their first home continues to rise. According to Bankrate, as reported by CNBC, Americans needed a salary of at least $111,000 in 2024 to afford a median-priced home with a 20 percent down payment — an increase of 50 percent in just the last four years. Increasingly, millennials are receiving help from family to cover those down payments. In 2024, 36 percent of millennial and young homebuyers needed family help to make a down payment, doubling from 18 percent in 2019, Redfin found.

	That's leaving a lot of would-be homeowners out in the cold to face rising rents. It's no wonder that Mamdani, who has pledged to pursue a rent freeze for all stabilized tenants and to build new housing for renters while bringing down rents. 


	“The number one reason working families are leaving our city is the housing crisis,” Mamdani says in his platform. “The mayor has the power to change that.”

	Utah Governor Spencer Cox said that the alleged shooter in the killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk is “not cooperating” with authorities while in custody.


	“He has not confessed to authorities. He is not cooperating, but, all the people around him are cooperating. And I think that's very important,” Cox said Sunday on ABC's This Week.


	Authorities arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson last week in connection with the shooting after his father confronted him with images of the alleged shooter. 


	“Tyler, is this you? This looks like you,” Robinson's father asked his son, CNN reported, citing a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. Robinson, with his father's encouragement, later turned himself in to police on Thursday night.


	Cox said that formal charges will be filed against Robinson on Tuesday.


	Asked about reporting by The New York Times that said Robinson exchanged messages with friends on Discord joking about being the alleged shooter after the event.

	











	“All we can confirm is that those conversations definitely were happening, and they did not believe it was actually him. It was, it was all joking until, until he, you know, until he admitted that it actually was him,” he said.


	According to the Times, Robinson joked that his “doppelganger” was responsible for the shooting.


	Appearing on CNN's State of the Nation, Cox addressed questions about Robinson's roommate.


	“Some outlets are reporting that the suspect lived with a transgender partner. Is that accurate? And are investigators looking at this part of his life as a possible motivation?” Dana Bash asked Cox.

	











	“I can confirm that. I know that has been reported and that the FBI has confirmed that as well, that the roommate was a romantic partner, a male transitioning to female,” Cox said.


	“I can say that he has been very cooperative,” Cox continued, possibly misgendering the roommate. “This partner has been incredibly cooperative, had no idea that this was happening and is working with investigators right now.”

	On NBC, Cox added that the roommate “was shocked when they found out about it.”


	But when Bash again brought up whether the two were romantically involved, the governor seemed to say that is not confirmed yet: “We're trying to figure it out. I know everybody wants to know exactly why and point the finger, and I totally get that. I do, too.”


	Cox told The Wall Street Journal earlier the shooter was “deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology.” When Martha Raddatz asked Cox specifically about that comment on Sunday, the governor said that information “has come from his acquaintances and his family members.”

Utah. Gov. Spencer Cox told @MarthaRaddatz that acquittances and family members of Tyler Robinson have indicated he was “deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology,” but said more information will be included in the charging documents against him. https://t.co/e2j30BKSjI pic.twitter.com/z6RuUGYC64


	Back on CNN, Cox — who last week after Robinson's arrest that he had been “praying” that the shooter was “somebody [who] drove from another state, somebody [who] came from another country” — said, “I really don't have a dog in this fight. If this was MAGA and a radicalized MAGA person, I would be saying that as well. If the friends were saying that, I would be sharing that as well. That's not what they're sharing.”


	When pressed for specifics about what Robinson said about Kirk to his family, Cox said, “Just not a fan. That's all I can say.”

	Many on the right, including Donald Trump and Cox, have been quick to blame the left for Kirk's shooting. 


	Asked for his reaction to Trump's comments blaming the left, Cox said, “Well, look, President Trump is very angry. And Charlie is his close personal friend. There is a lot of anger — a lot of anger on the right, on my side of the aisle. And I've certainly felt that. And in this case, it does appear that that's true. Again, more information is coming, and we'll learn more over time. You know, I don't know that that matters as much as the radicalization piece. I brought up the Democrats who were assassinated recently and how quickly we move on from these things. But the body count is piling up. And so, I'm so concerned about this radicalization piece. And that's what we're trying to understand.”

RADDATZ: You talked about Democrats who have been targeted. Trump said nothing about the political violence against Democrats. In fact, he blamed the radical left. What's your reaction to that?SPENCER COX: Well look, President Trump is very angry.

Never-before-seen video captures US missile striking, bouncing off mysterious orb","https://www.al.com/news/2025/09/ufo-on-camera-never-before-seen-video-captures-us-missile-striking-bouncing-off-mysterious-orb.html","Sun, 14 Sep 2025 18:05:00 GMT","

A video revealed by a member of Congress captured a mysterious aircraft that stays on course after a U.S. missile appears to bounce off it as it travels through the sky.

The never-before-seen video was released by Rep. Eric Burlison, R-MO, at a House Government Oversight subcommittee hearing in to Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) on Tuesday, ABC News reported.

UAP is the military's term for UFOs or unidentified objects in the air, sea or space.

Burlison said the video, provided by a whistleblower and as of yet unconfirmed, was taken October 30, 2024, when an M-9 Reaper drone was allegedly tracking an “orb” off the coast of Yemen. 

The video appears to show the object being hit by a Hellfire missile fired from the drone, but after the assumed impact, the aircraft continues as if it had not been struck.

“Greenlight given to engage, missile appears to be ineffective against the target,” Burlison said in an post on X.

Military and defense officials declined to comment regarding the video, according to the reports.

With as many bands as the Seattle area has produced over the years, it's somewhat surprising that none head a proper music festival of their own back home.

That changed this weekend when Modest Mouse kicked off its two-day Psychic Salamander festival Saturday at Remlinger Farms. In some respects, it had been years in the making, with talks between the indie rock giants' late drummer Jeremiah Green and Seattle Theatre Group, which partnered with Remlinger Farms on the Carnation venue, predating STG's THING festival.

It seemed like natural timing. With Modest Mouse hitting the road this summer for a joint run with psych rockers The Flaming Lips, the twin headliners — each playing both nights — were already in place. To accompany the kindred-ly wiggy tourmates, Modest Mouse main man Isaac Brock and STG assembled a cast of indie rock heavyweights that includes Courtney Barnett, fellow PNW greats Sleater-Kinney (performing Sunday) and Bult to Spill, as well as some of Brock's personal faves like The Vaudevillian and Mattress, who kicked off Saturday.

In some respects, it's hard not to compare the reformatted THING festival and Psychic Salamander, between their shared Remlinger Farms location — roughly 20 minutes from where Brock grew up in Issaquah — and intertwining origins. (In 2018, Modest Mouse played two shows in Port Townsend, where Green long resided, which served as a precursor to THING. The band returned to headline THING in 2022.) With its indie-rock-dominant lineup and Remlinger's kid-friendly amusement park open to festivalgoers, Psychic Salamander felt like a less eclectic (and better attended) alternate universe version of the discovery-focused THING.

With Modest Mouse at the helm and a clearer throughline between the artists filling the single-stage megabills — even compared to new-look THING's more intentionally grouped weekends — Psychic Salamander naturally had a more focused audience. These artist-anchored festivals often have a different feel than more traditional festivals with multiple stages and rotating headliners, instead drawing more heavily from the anchor band's dedicated followings.

That much was clear when Modest Mouse took the stage, following invigorating big-guitar sets from Doug Martsch's Built to Spill and fellow indie rock shredder Courtney Barnett, who delivered possibly her fiercest Seattle-area performance in recent years, topping even a 2022 date when the Australian rocker brought her own traveling festival to Marymoor Park.

Between the Modest Mouse faithful's anticipation and Brock & Co.'s midtour form, the band's early-evening set hit with the intensity and immediacy of a club gig on steroids. The six-piece touring band — boasting dual percussionists and occasionally augmented with a violinist — came out roaring with a pair of oldies, starting with a full-forced “Breakthrough” off their debut album “This is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About.”

Wiry guitars sprayed like a buckshot on “Teeth Like God's Shoeshine” — an early Modest Mouse classic that's equally epic and erratic — with Brock alternately between reining in and winding back up the explosive seven-minute song. Its expansiveness was only matched in scope by a more solemn “Night on the Sun,” a midset highlight off the 1999 EP of the same name.

With Brock's willingness to mine Modest Mouse's deep catalog and skillfully interchange their sets, the Northwest indie rock greats certainly have the ability to keep recurring festival headline sets interesting from year to year, should Psychic Salamander become a fixture of the Seattle-area festival landscape.

After a fan-requested “Cowboy Dan” and the unreleased “Third Side of the Moon” (a live staple over the past year), Modest Mouse closed their 90-minute set with a jagged, tail-spinning “[Expletive] Luck” from 1997's “The Lonesome Crowded West” — a seminal PNW indie rock document. “This plane is definitely crashing!” Brock barked, with audio shrapnel flinging in all directions.

In a last-minute shake-up, Brock ceded closing duties at his own festival to his tourmates The Flaming Lips, a hard (and bizarre) act to follow due to their over-the-top live show. Although some fans were a little disappointed that the switch shaved a half-hour off Modest Mouse's previously announced set time, it made sense functionally. While also reducing the down time between the two bands, the Lips' more elaborate light show and cartoonishly psychedelic theatrics required the dark of night for full effect.

With their confetti-blasting, acid-dropped pageantry, The Flaming Lips have been the ultimate indie rock festival band for years. But The Flaming Lips experience, informed by Pink Floyd and whatever eccentric voices are whispering in frontman Wayne Coyne's head, was clearly new to some in the crowd, as more than a few fans went sprinting to the front when eight 20-foot-tall inflatable robots puffed up on stage during the squishy singalong “Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, Pt 1.”

Between the lasers shooting out into the crowd, a giant video board backdrop blasting hyper-stimulating visuals (at various points, think “Yellow Submarine” meets Japanese game show) and tree-branching light stands flickering and shimmering like fireworks, it often felt like Coyne and the band were performing in the middle of a bizarro Fourth of July. While some of their gimmicks — including Coyne's crowd-surfing human hamster ball, which he saved for a closing “Race for the Prize” — lose some luster over the years, the Oklahoma band's set offered plenty for the old heads.

“Feeling Yourself Disintegrate” was a spellbound highlight, with or without the mesmerizing lights, as was a cosmic-twang cover of Daniel Johnston's “True Love Will Find You in the End.” The latter packed even more of a punch than an encore-starting “War Pigs” in homage to recently deceased metal god Ozzy Osbourne.

While Saturdays typically draw the largest festival crowds, Day 2 of Psychic Salamander feels like the main event, with The Flaming Lips and Modest Mouse each set to play seminal albums in full, with “The Soft Bulletin” and “The Moon & Antarctica,” respectively.
