                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK (AP) — In the days following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, numerous workers have been fired for their comments on his death, among them MSNBC political analyst Matthew Dowd. Several conservative activists have sought to identify social media users whose posts about Kirk they viewed as offensive or celebratory, targeting everyone from journalists to teachers. Right-wing influencer Laura Loomer said she would try to ruin the professional aspirations of anyone who celebrated Kirk's death. It's far from the first time workers have lost their jobs over things they say publicly — including in social media posts. In the U.S., laws can vary across states, but overall, there's very little legal protections for employees who are punished for speech made both in and out of private workplaces. “Most people think they have a right to free speech…but that doesn't necessarily apply in the workplace,” said Vanessa Matsis-McCready, associate general counsel and vice president of HR Services for Engage PEO. “Most employees in the private sector do not have any protections for that type of speech at work.” Add to that the prevalence of social media, which has made it increasingly common to track employees' conduct outside of work and to dox people, or publish information about them online with the intent of harming or harassing them. Protections for workers vary from one state to the next. For example, in New York, if an employee is participating in a weekend political protest, but not associating themselves with the organization that employs them, their employer cannot fire them for that activity when they return to work. But if that same employee is at a company event on a weekend and talks about their political viewpoints in a way that makes others feel unsafe or the target of discrimination or harassment, then they could face consequences at work, Matsis-McCready said. Most of the U.S. defaults to “at-will” employment law — which essentially means employers can choose to hire and fire as they see fit, including over employees' speech. “The First Amendment does not apply in private workplaces to protect employees' speech,” said Andrew Kragie, an attorney who specializes in employment and labor law at Maynard Nexsen. Kragie said there are “pockets of protection” around the U.S. under various state laws, such as statutes that forbid punishing workers for their political views. Steven T. Collis, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin and faculty director of the school's Bech-Loughlin First Amendment Center, also points to some state laws that say employers can't fire their workers for “legal off duty conduct.” But there's often an exception for conduct seen as disruptive to an employer's business or reputation, which could be grounds to fire someone over public comments or social media posts. “In this scenario, if somebody feels like one of their employees has done something that suggests they are glorifying or celebrating a murder, an employer might still be able to fire them even with one of those laws on the books,” Collis said. For public employees, which can range from school teachers and postal workers to elected officials, the process is a bit different. The Supreme Court has ruled that if an employee is acting in a private capacity but speaking on a matter of public concern, they could be protected. Still, he noted that government employers can discipline a worker if they determine such conduct will interfere with the government's ability to do its job. For instance, leaders at the Pentagon unveiled a “zero tolerance” policy for any posts or comments from troops that make light of or celebrate the killing of Kirk. The policy, announced by the Pentagon's top spokesman Sean Parnell on social media Thursday, came hours after numerous conservative military influencers and activists began forwarding posts they considered problematic to Parnell and his boss, defense secretary Pete Hegseth. The ubiquity of social media is making it easier than ever to share opinions about politics and major news events as they're unfolding. But posting on social media leaves a record, and in times of escalating political polarization, those declarations can be seen as damaging to the reputation of an individual or their employer. “The gamification of the way we communicate in the workplace, Slack and Teams, chat and all these things, they're very similar to how you might interact on Instagram or other social media, so I do think that makes it feel a little less formal and somebody might be more inclined to take to take a step and say, ‘Oh, I can't believe this happened,'” Matsis-McCready said. Many employers are reviewing their policies on political speech and providing training about what appropriate conduct looks like, both inside and outside the organization, she said. And the brutal nature of Kirk's killing may have led some of them to react more strongly in the days that followed his death. “Because of the violent nature of what some political discussion is now about, I think there is a real concern from employers that they want to keep the workplace safe and that they're being extra vigilant about anything that could be viewed as a threat, which is their duty,” Matsis-McCreedy said. That is leading more companies to act on what employees are saying online, she said. Still, experts like Collis don't anticipate a significant change in how employers monitor their workers speech — noting that online activity has come under the spotlight for at least the last 15 years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• DC reels from Kirk killing: The impact of Charlie Kirk's assassination is being felt throughout Washington, from scrutiny over President Donald Trump's rhetoric and the FBI director to renewed efforts to better protect lawmakers. • Investigation updates: The roommate of Tyler Robinson, Kirk's alleged shooter, was a romantic partner of Robinson and was transitioning from male to female, the Utah governor said Sunday. • Crime crackdown: Meanwhile, Trump has pushed ahead with his federal law enforcement crackdown in Democratic-led cities, though he shifted focus last week from Chicago to Memphis in part to avoid legal headaches, sources told CNN. Robinson is under enhanced supervision and will remain on special watch pending a mental health evaluation, a process that may take several days, according to Sgt. “After cleared by mental health, he will proceed through our classification process to determine the appropriate housing area,” Ormond said. “He will continue to be monitored by mental, medical, and custody staff throughout the duration of his stay.” Ormond stated the precautionary measures are standard for cases involving serious charges or potential behavioral concerns. While Ormond said he hasn't been made aware of any specific suicidal comments from Robinson, the suspect will continue to be monitored by medical, mental health and custody staff throughout his stay. Speaker Mike Johnson said he's been working to reassure House members about their personal security in the days following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Johnson said leadership is looking at “all the options” to bolster member security and urged lawmakers to “turn down the rhetoric,” saying allegations that Republicans are “fascists” is “not helpful.” “There are some deranged people in society, and when they see leaders using that kind of language so often now, increasingly, it spurs them on to action,” he said, adding that he's “heartened” to see “many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are stepping up and saying that.” Johnson said he will participate in a vigil for Kirk on Sunday evening at the Kennedy Center. Republican Utah Sen. John Curtis took aim at partisan labels for the word “radical” after the shooting of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk in his home state. “I think you need to take the word radical and remove ‘right' or ‘left.' Radical coming from any direction is not good, it's not healthy and it should be called out,” Curtis said on Sunday on ABC's “This Week.” The Utah Senator honed in on social media's impact, saying there is often “zero liability for what people are putting out there.” “It (social media) can be positive, but I fear in many cases, it's a huge weight and a very negative weight on this generation.” “So it's good to have local leaders that understand the importance of the work that this president is doing,” she continued. He's grateful for the partnership of those local leaders, and we're looking forward to making a big difference there for the people that are in Tennessee.” However, Young offered a starkly different account in an interview with CNN a day earlier, saying he was blindsided by the decision and does not support the deployment. “I'm certainly not happy,” Young told CNN, referring to the deployment of federal troops. On Friday, during an appearance on “Fox & Friends,” Trump said he was sending National Guard troops to Memphis to combat the city's high crime rates, calling it a “deeply troubled” place. After shootings rocked the country this week, Colorado Gov. “What I would focus on is condemning the act of violence. It's not the free speech that led to this. It's not the fact that people can talk and communicate online. It's the actions of an unhinged, evil individual that caused this horrible, horrific assassination,” Polis said on ABC's “This Week,” referencing the killing of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk as a defining moment not only for the United States but for the world and discussed one of their final exchanges about violent crime and government accountability. “In fact, the last thing Charlie had texted me about a day or two before he passed away, was about those mayors and governors,” Noem told Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo” on Sunday. When asked why Kirk's assassination marked a national turning point, the DHS secretary emphasized its broader impact. “Some of the rhetoric we're seeing out of the left and out of political animals is ugly and it's bitter and it's seeking to seize this opportunity to turn it into evil. And I would just encourage everybody to start focusing on relationships, start focusing on each other and talk about what Charlie believed in.” Spencer Cox further elaborated on how investigators have determined that Tyler Robinson, the alleged shooter of Charlie Kirk, had been radicalized, pointing to gaming and “dark internet” culture as potential factors that contributed to a shift. Cox on CNN's “State of the Union” Sunday gave more details about his comment to the Wall Street Journal last week that Robinson had been “deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology,” suggesting that came from conversations Robinson had with friends. In an interview on NBC's “Meet the Press” with Kristen Welker, Cox added, “According to family and people that we're interviewing, he does come from a conservative family but his ideology was very different from his family and so that's part of it.” Robinson, Cox said, is not cooperating with authorities, but they have been able to glean significant information from family, friends, and acquaintances. Cox suggested things changed for Robinson after he dropped out of Utah State University. Clearly, there was a lot of gaming going on, friends that have confirmed that there was kind of that deep, dark internet, Reddit culture and these other dark places of the internet where this person was going deep. … the meme-ification that is happening in our society today,” he told NBC. Cox, who appeared on a trio of Sunday shows to offer some new details about the investigation, said the White House asked him to. “I don't do a lot of national media anymore and it was the encouragement of the White House that I'm on this program this morning,” he told Raddatz. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, the husband of former Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was shot at an event in 2011, called political violence “a pervasive issue in our country” and cautioned against placing blame with one side. “Whether you're a governor or senator, a member of the House, president of the United States, you have to be very careful about your words because people are listening,” Kelly said on NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday. Kelly said his wife, who has been focused on curbing gun violence in the US since she was shot, was particularly affected by Charlie Kirk's assassination. “I would say this one in particular hit her pretty hard, and it's because she saw the video. You know, the video is all over social media. “I hope some of these social media companies can scrub this off the internet, because it's not good for kids to see this.” Spencer Cox has made it a personal campaign to turn down the nation's political temperature and “disagree better” in the wake of Charlie Kirk's murder. But Trump ally Steve Bannon, meanwhile, has attacked Cox as a “national embarrassment.” But he also said some other things about forgiveness,” Cox told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” Asked on CNN's “State of the Union” on Sunday for more specifics, Cox said that Robinson was “just not a fan,” and declined to elaborate further. Cox spoke by phone with President Donald Trump after his remarks at a press conference on Friday, he said, describing the call as a “long conversation” and “very sobering.” Asked for his response, Cox told CNN's Dana Bash, “He's not wrong. Investigators are looking into a note left by Tyler Robinson, the alleged shooter of Charlie Kirk, Utah Gov. Cox appeared to confirm the existence of a note in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union,” but indicated it was still under review. Pressed by Bash on whether a note was found and its contents were known by law enforcement, he declined to share specifics. The roommate of Tyler Robinson, Charlie Kirk's alleged shooter, was a romantic partner of Robinson and transitioning from male to female, Utah Gov. Investigators are looking into whether that was a factor in last week's assassination. The roommate, Cox added, “has been incredibly cooperative, had no idea that this was happening, and is working with investigators right now.” I do too, and so I just want to be careful, as I haven't read all of the interview transcripts, and so we'll have to wait and see what comes out,” he said. Cox was asked about previous comments that Robinson had been indoctrinated with “leftist ideology.” He said that information “comes from the people around him, from his family members and his friends.” Official charges, Cox said, will be filed on Tuesday. President Donald Trump issued an ultimatum yesterday to NATO allies in a letter, saying that the US will issue “major” sanctions on Russia only when NATO countries agree to do the same and stop buying oil from Russia. Trump's demands would mark a major shift in policies among the alliance, and there are major questions as to whether there could be collective interest in taking these steps. “I am ready to do major Sanctions on Russia when all NATO Nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all NATO Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA,” he said in a post to social media, quoting what he said was a letter sent to his NATO counterparts. He continued, “As you know, NATO'S commitment to WIN has been far less than 100%, and the purchase of Russian Oil, by some, has been shocking! It greatly weakens your negotiating position, and bargaining power, over Russia. Anyway, I am ready to ‘go' when you are. “I believe that this, plus NATO, as a group, placing 50% to 100% TARIFFS ON CHINA, to be fully withdrawn after the WAR with Russia and Ukraine is ended, will also be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR,” he said. Trump added that Russia's war in Ukraine would end “quickly” if those steps are taken. CNN has previously reported that the European Union imposed a ban on maritime Russian oil imports and refined oil products like diesel, but many countries continue to import Russian fossil fuels and liquefied natural gas. President Donald Trump announced Friday that his administration would target Memphis as part of his efforts to crack down on crime in major US cities. City leaders push back: But Memphis Mayor Paul Young said at a Friday afternoon news conference that it was not done at his request, asserting that he learned in the morning “that the President and Governor are looking to bring Federal resources to our city which include the National Guard, which they have the authority to do.” Yesterday, Young told CNN's Victor Blackwell that he didn't have official confirmation until Trump announced it Friday during an interview with Fox News, but he “learned earlier this week that it was under consideration.” But while the Department of Homeland Security has announced an immigration crackdown there, troops have not been mobilized. JB Pritzker, who has been in a war of words with Trump. President Donald Trump, who'd floated cracking down on leftists and liberal organizations he baselessly blamed for political violence, topped it off Friday morning by suggesting conservative extremists have been radicalized for legitimate reasons, while saying “radicals on the left are the problem.” Spencer Cox — a Republican who has spent years calling for quite the opposite approach: a more civil and less angry version of politics. During two news conferences last week, Cox used his speaking time to project a far different message than that of Trump and leading MAGA figures. And that's the problem with political violence,” Cox said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fox & Friends host Brian Kilmeade attends the 79th annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, Oct. 17, 2024, in New York. Fox News Channel host Brian Kilmeade apologized on Sunday for advocating for the execution of mentally ill homeless people in a discussion on the network last week, saying his remark was “extremely callous.” Kilmeade's initial comment came on a “Fox & Friends” episode Wednesday and began getting widespread circulation online over the weekend. Kilmeade, a host of the morning show, was talking with co-hosts Lawrence Jones and Ainsley Earhardt about the Aug. 22 stabbing murder of Iryna Zarutska on a light rail train in Charlotte, North Carolina. A homeless and mentally ill man, Decarlos Brown Jr., was arrested for murder, and the case received extensive attention on Fox following the release of a security video of the stabbing. Jones was talking on “Fox & Friends” on Wednesday about public money spent on trying to help homeless people and suggested that those who didn't accept services offered to them should be jailed. Earhardt interjected, “Why did it have to get to this point?” Kilmeade replied, “I will say this, we're not voting for the right people.” During an appearance on the “Fox & Friends” weekend show Sunday, Kilmeade said that “I wrongly said they should get lethal injection. I am obviously aware that not all mentally ill, homeless people act as the perpetrator did in North Carolina and that so many homeless people deserve our empathy and compassion.” Fox News management did not immediately return messages seeking comment. An advocate for homeless people said Sunday that Kilmeade's remark had been “completely devoid of all humanity.” Christine Quinn, president and CEO of Win, a provider of shelter and services for homeless children in New York City, invited Kilmeade to volunteer in one of the organization's shelters. Kilmeade's initial remark came hours before the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah. An MSNBC analyst, Matthew Dowd, was fired for saying on the air that afternoon that hateful rhetoric can lead to hateful actions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kirk was killed Wednesday during an outdoor debate event on campus. Students who witnessed his assassination are reckoning with trauma and grief. Kirk, the CEO and co-founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA, was a top podcaster, culture warrior and ally of President Donald Trump. In a livestreamed speech, Erika Kirk thanked US President Donald Trump, US Vice President JD Vance and supporters who had “shown their love” for her husband.

BASKING RIDGE, New Jersey (AP) — After years of complaints from the right about “cancel culture” from the left, some conservatives are seeking to upend the lives and careers of those who disparaged Charlie Kirk after his death. This past weekend, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy posted that American Airlines had grounded pilots who he said were celebrating Kirk's assassination. “This behavior is disgusting and they should be fired,” Duffy said on the social media site X. Such tactics raise a fundamental challenge for a nation that by many accounts appears to be dangerously splintered by politics and a sense of moral outrage that social media helps to fuel. Republicans are pushing not only to punish the alleged killer but those whose words they believe contributed to the death or dishonored it. At the same time, some liberals on social media have criticized those, such as actress Kristin Chenoweth, who expressed sympathy online over Kirk's death. “This pattern that we've seen for decades seems to be happening much more now and at this moment than it ever has before,” said Adam Goldstein of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. “If there was ever time to support the better angels of our nature, it's now.” “The only time you're really supporting free speech is when it's unpopular,” Goldstein said. But he and other authorities also say the suspect was not known to have been politically engaged. Kirk was seen as an architect of President Donald Trump's 2024 election win, helping to expand the Republican outreach to younger voters. This is an attack on a movement by using violence. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who is running for governor, called on social media for the firings of an assistant dean at Middle Tennessee State University and professors at Austin Peay State University and Cumberland University. Some NFL teams chose on Sunday to hold a moment of silence for Kirk. Football teams have in the past chosen to memorialize victims after school shootings or an attack on a house of worship. They have also marked notable deaths of public figures, weather-related disasters and international crises such as Hamas' attack on Israel in October 2023. Because conservatives previously felt canceled by liberals for their views, Trump on his first day back in office signed an executive order prohibiting everyone in the federal government from engaging in conduct that would “unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen.” In February at the Munich Security Conference, Vice President JD Vance criticized the preceding Biden administration for encouraging “private companies to silence people who dared to utter what turned out to be an obvious truth” regarding the pandemic. “Under Donald Trump's leadership, we may disagree with your views, but we will fight to defend your right to offer it in the public square, agree or disagree,” Vance said at the time. Still, the Trump administration has also cracked down on immigrants and academics for their speech. Goldstein noted that Trump's State Department in the minutes after Kirk's death warned it would revoke the visas of any foreigners who celebrated Kirk's assassination. “I can't think of another moment where the United States has come out to warn people of their impending cancellation,” Goldstein said. But many Republican lawmakers have also targeted traditional news media that criticized Trump for contributing to a toxic political climate with his consistent rhetoric painting anyone against him as an enemy. On Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures,” Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., blamed news outlets for having guests on who called Trump a “facist” or compared him to the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. But for Britt, those expressions were unfair, inaccurate and triggered violence. “There must be consequences with regards to people spewing that type of hate and celebration in the face of this,” Britt said.

Cleveland Browns legend Joe Thomas is giving the "Shedeur Sanders cult" a reality check in his appearance on OutKick's "Don't @ Me with Dan Dakich." Shedeur Sanders reportedly made an effort to avoid being selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the 2025 NFL Draft. However, Sanders reportedly made it known that he didn't want to get stuck behind two-time NFL MVP Lamar Jackson on the depth chart. Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders (12) warms up before the game agaist the Baltimore Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium on Sept. 14, 2025. Sanders was looking to be chosen by a team in which he would have a chance to play. The Ravens ended up taking offensive lineman Carson Vinson and Sanders went to the Cleveland Browns a few picks later. He would have been in a battle with Cooper Rush and Devin Leary for the backup job. Leary was signed to a futures contract in January but didn't make the final roster.

Independent journalist Evita Duffy-Alfonso joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss the backlash that those mourning Charlie Kirk on social media are receiving and where it is stemming from. A New Jersey nurse who reported a doctor who allegedly "cheered and celebrated" Charlie Kirk's assassination is suing after she faced disciplanry action, her lawyer said in a lawsuit filed on Friday. Lexi Kuenzle, 33, a nurse at Englewood Health, filed suit Friday against the hospital, Dr. Matthew Jung and others for the incident that allegedly occurred "in front of patients and staff." "She had the audacity to question how Dr. Jung can comply with the Hippocratic Oath's and the American Medical Association's Code of Medical Ethics while celebrating the murder of a non-violent Christian speaker who was on a college campus," Kuenzle's attorney, John Coyle, said in the complaint. Dr. Jung then allegedly "offered to ‘buy lunch' for the nursing staff that he offended," the lawsuit states. A memorial for Turning Point USA CEO and co-founder Charlie Kirk is seen at Utah Valley University, Saturday, Sept. 13, 2025, in Orem, Utah. Kuenzle reported Wednesday's incident to management and posted about it on social media when she got home, she told the New York Post. How could you say someone deserved to die?" Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk was shot and killed during an event Thursday in Utah. Following her complaint, the nurse claimed she was suspended without pay while an investigation took place. The hospital told Fox News Digital it is aware of the incident, and that "both the doctor and nurse were placed on suspension to allow time for a thorough and fair investigation, following our standard protocol, and in the interest of everyone's safety including their own." "Contrary to certain media reports, the nurse was not fired. Any reported suggestions that the nurse should seek other employment was not an official or accurate statement from Englewood Health," the statement from Englewood Health said. The lawsuit filed by Coyle on behalf of Kuenzle claims the hospital violated the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination due to their knowledge of Kuenzle's Christian faith, retaliated against her, violated the Conscientious Employee Protection Act and created a hostile work environment. As of Sunday morning Dr. Jung was no longer listed on Englewood Health's website. Fox News Digital's Sophia Compton contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On a recent Friday morning, I found myself in a sea of bodies waiting to be admitted to Universal's new $7 billion Orlando theme park, Epic Universe. We filed through a metal detector and presented our tickets. In recent years, Americans have drifted away from many of their once-beloved sources of pleasure: drinking, throwing parties, having sex, making friends. And this is despite years of price hikes: At $199 on the busiest days, one ticket to the Magic Kingdom can cost more than a week's worth of groceries. Disney's “Experiences” division is more profitable than its TV and movie business, bringing in billions of dollars annually. Even so, park operators have had to work hard to engineer fun at a time when people have become more fickle about what qualifies. “When Disneyland opened, it was the most exciting technological thing you could see,” Phil Hettema, who spent more than a decade working on Universal's parks, told me. To meet this challenge, rides are bumping against the limits of physics and the human body to deliver experiences that are more death-defying than ever before. There are hyper-coasters (more than 200 feet tall), giga-coasters (more than 300 feet tall), and strata-coasters (even taller) capable of hurtling people at 120 miles an hour. I'd heard of visitors stepping inside and bursting into tears. Walt Disney pioneered the art of micromanaging visitors' experiences when, 70 years ago, he opened his first park, Disneyland, in California. To prevent life's unpleasantness from impinging on his utopia, he did not allow the sale of newspapers and borrowed filmmaking techniques to place attractions within meticulously composed landscapes—a lush jungle, the Old West. In so doing, he helped invent what would come to be known as the theme park. “An amusement park without rides is a parking lot with popcorn.” At the Magic Kingdom—the successor to Disneyland that opened in 1971—the themes of various parts of the park are lax by current standards: You can, for example, find Aladdin's carpets and a tiki room side by side under the broad heading of “Adventureland.” The latest thinking among park operators is that impressing visitors requires re-creating, to an unprecedented scale, complete worlds they know from movies and video games. Epic Universe is home to a wood-hewn, Viking-style land based on the How to Train Your Dragon franchise; a Super Nintendo World with perfectly spinning gold coins; and a horror-themed village inhabited by Dracula, Wolf Man, and other monsters from classic films, where the mist floating over gravestones feels eerie even under the Florida sun. The landscape at Epic Universe is so detailed that some visitors hire tour guides—which begin at $460 per person—to highlight minutiae they might miss and to share the history, both real and fictional, of their surroundings. Blakeney, who left Universal last spring, specializes in equipping theme parks with all of the unsexy infrastructure required to function—toilets, cellphone towers—as well as ensuring that none of it impinges on the illusion. In 2019, the Orlando Sentinel reported on a 22-year-old woman who, while waiting to board an Avatar-themed ride at Disney World, “felt something wet on the back of her leg” and discovered that the man next to her was peeing. Rather than sacrifice her own place in line, she waited another 20 minutes, then alerted an employee. To manage the thousands of people who descend daily, operators have studied visitors' behavior and engineered their parks to move people around without anyone realizing they're being nudged. One of Disney's early innovations was to lure visitors through its parks with enormous structures, such as castles, that Walt Disney referred to as “wienies,” supposedly because of the gravitational pull he observed hot dogs having on his toy poodle. I'd watched videos of the Harry Potter ride online, and I was looking forward to flying through the air alongside dueling witches and wizards who, while firing colorful clouds of spells at one another, trash the Ministry of Magic's wood-paneled offices with help from stampeding beasts, then destroy a time-travel chamber, only to get sucked into the swirling black void of space. The difficulty of pulling off this illusion is hard to overstate. New rides like this one can cost $100 million, if not more, to create; incorporate LiDAR laser systems of the kind used on self-driving cars; and rely on robotic figures with thousands of moving parts. Designers do test runs, making minute adjustments to bring the elaborate machinery—lights, video projections, animatronics—into perfect sync. But even as rides have become more complex, the storylines behind them have gotten quicker and simpler to accommodate shrinking attention spans. BOOM—and then you're just jumping on to the next one,” Thierry Coup, a former Universal executive who oversaw the creative development of Epic Universe, told me. Since Disney first started experimenting with a tiered entry system in 1999, theme parks have discovered that they need to build physical barriers separating the regular and express lines. I consoled myself with the thought that, according to some riders, I'd already experienced the best part: a cavernous, green-tiled room of airplane-hangar proportions that housed towering Ministry of Magic offices. Walking around Epic Universe, I found myself hunting for spots where reality had intruded on the fantasy. Every night, Blakeney told me, an army of employees filed into Epic Universe to power wash sidewalks, deadhead the plants, repaint dirty walls, and replace lightbulbs. They'd work until dawn creating the illusion of effortless beauty. The unnatural perfection struck me as slightly off-putting, but some people find that it can be hard to give up once they get used to it. Not long before my trip, Jill and Kevin Levett, a married couple in their 60s who live north of London, had flown to Orlando for the grand opening of Epic Universe. The Levetts, semi-retired bus drivers, first visited Orlando's theme parks together in 2012. Since then, they've basically quit vacationing anywhere except Universal's four Florida parks. They travel to Orlando four or five times a year, sometimes for weeks at a stretch, and will go to the parks in costume. Kevin often dresses as a Hogwarts Express conductor from the Harry Potter series (red vest, customized pocket watch, suit dyed the perfect shade of brown); Jill frequently goes as the imperious witch Dolores Umbridge, shouting commands in a wig, a custom-made dress, and pale-pink ballet flats. “I stay in character all day,” Jill told me. While they're in the parks, the Levetts post updates and photos to a 184,000-person Facebook group of Universal devotees, run by a company that helps plan vacations to Orlando theme parks. Through it, the Levetts have become so recognizable that fellow Universal fans will stop them in the parks to ask for selfies. Between flights, hotels, and their annual park passes, the couple estimates they spend $20,000 a year on their Orlando trips, though this seemed conservative given that they were preparing to pay $2,600 for a private VIP tour of Epic Universe with friends from their Facebook group. Last summer, after years of hip problems and some difficult surgeries to address them, Jill had an operation that went poorly. “When we came out of hospital, Jill was so down, so depressed, I turned around to her and said, ‘We're going to Universal,'” Kevin recalled. But it helps you escape from some of that,” he said. At Universal's parks, Kevin explained, “everything is as it should be in a perfect world.” Harry Potter's Paris at Epic Universe, for example, has magical creatures and no cigarette butts. His frown made clear that “Paris as it really is” was indisputably a bad thing. Read: I went to Disney World as the coronavirus pandemic ravaged Florida For all the warm and fuzzy feelings they engender, theme parks spend an astronomical amount of effort and money to simulate the feeling that they are trying to kill us. On a roller coaster, the theme park commands your full and undivided attention. Stardust Racers, which a roller-coaster critic called “one of the greatest on the planet,” has “top hats” (abrupt rises and falls mimicking the shape of Abraham Lincoln's stovepipe hat); “airtime hills” (which make you feel like you're floating); “ejector airtime” (which tosses your body into the ride's restraints); a “zero-g roll” (a 360-degree twist that spins you upside down and makes you feel weightless); “crossovers” (where the track loops back on itself); and several “head-choppers” (moments where the coaster seems like it'll rip your skull off). One of the challenges of building coasters is that each one is, essentially, a prototype—Stardust Racers is the only ride in the world that weaves two groups of people around each other and upside down, mid-air—and these prototypes must work safely and reliably from opening day, 14 hours a day, hundreds of days a year, for 30 years (the estimated lifespan of a coaster). Tweaks are rare, but sometimes necessary: a section of track might require reconstruction or brakes might need to be introduced to slow an unexpectedly speedy stretch. Roller coasters were once limited by technology, but now it's our bodies that are holding them back. Coasters can subject riders to g-forces more powerful than those typically experienced by astronauts—people on Stardust Racers will experience more than 4 g's of force, compared with the 3 g's typical during a space-shuttle launch—though industry guidelines limit how long riders should be made to endure such strong accelerations. At upwards of 4 g's, the human heart struggles to pump blood; you should experience this for no more than two seconds, per the standards for rides in the U.S. “The time is very important here because you don't want people graying out or maybe even blacking out,” Daniel Schoppen, a roller-coaster designer with the firm Intamin, which has built attractions for Universal's parks, told me. To Schoppen, the best coaster is like a piece of music: “Every part has its own motif, has its own feeling,” he told me. Theme parks are trying to bring back visitors by building rides that change a little each time; on Stardust Racers, which has two trains of cars racing each other on separate tracks, if one train car falls behind, it gets an extra oomph of acceleration near the middle of the ride—an additional thrill that one critic called “boost mode.” The riders who stagger off of Stardust Racers have wide, shaky smiles. Braving a ride offers “a sense of assurance that you will survive no matter what is going on, what trials and tribulations you may be undergoing,” the Disney historian and former “Imagineer” Tom Morris told me. “It's a way of proving that you can get through it.” When the world scares us, people turn to the controlled terror of theme parks. After the sun set, Epic Universe began to glow. From this angle, Super Nintendo World's polka-dotted Piranha Plants bounced within view of an eight-lane highway, a reminder of how finite the fantasy really was. Theme parks are celebrated for providing an escape, but part of their appeal is that they are real brick-and-mortar spaces, painstakingly engineered for visitors' pleasure. And for all their manicured artificiality, theme parks do not necessarily spoil us on reality. I wondered, then immediately corrected myself: This is real. Later, I caught myself rewatching videos of Harry Potter and Battle at the Ministry, an endless stream of which is available online, captured by people holding up phones on the ride. I kept trying to re-create the experience I'd missed, and watched them until I'd mastered each beat: The animatronic Death Eater crouching on a bookshelf casts a spell, then Dolores Umbridge appears on a screen, then a rhinoceros-like Erumpent tries to gore the riders with its horn. It was both frustrating and satisfying to know people were still dreaming up experiences that demanded to be felt in person.</p>

When the lash found our language, when they said don't read or write, our tongues were still gilded with a heavenly word. We still sang that holy song, even in this strange land. And we became messengers with each sin pitched against us— in Birmingham, there was God in the feet of the marchers and in the starched collar of Fred Shuttlesworth, in the curls and dimples of those four girls, in the boyish joy of Virgil and Johnny before their song was cut short. Messengers, all of us, speaking the word God left us in this weary land. And there is a messenger on Nassau Avenue with the word clear and strong on his tongue, a warrior for the Lord, a servant of the word. We are a living tongue— the word is a torch and we tote it proudly, what you hear is our collective soul, what you see is love walking, God's blueprint, ours is an unstoppable song.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Romania has condemned Moscow's “irresponsible actions” after alleging that a Russian drone breached Romanian airspace during an attack on neighboring Ukraine, prompting Bucharest to scramble fighter jets. The Russian drone used in attacks on Ukraine entered Romanian airspace at 6.05 p.m. local time on Saturday, according to Romania's defense ministry. The incident comes days after Poland shot down Russian drones that had violated its airspace earlier this week – prompting NATO allies to pledge to beef up defenses on the alliance's eastern flank. The drone was intercepted by two F-16 fighter jets, which were carrying out an air patrol mission in northern Dobruja and, according to the ministry, came close to downing it. The drone orbited for about 50 minutes, according to a statement from the defense ministry, before leaving national airspace near the town of Pardina in northern Dobruja, heading towards Ukraine. Its pilots received authorization to shoot it down but decided not to open fire after assessing the collateral risks. Kaja Kallas, the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, condemned the violation of Romanian airspace as “yet another unacceptable breach of an EU member state's sovereignty.” “This continued reckless escalation threatens regional security,” Kallas wrote in a post on X. “We stand in solidarity with Romania. I am in close contact with the Romanian government.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on X Saturday: “Today, Romania scrambled combat aircraft because of a Russian drone in its airspace. According to current data, the drone penetrated about 10 kilometers (around 6 miles) into Romanian territory and operated in NATO airspace for around 50 minutes.” In light of the incident, Zelensky reiterated calls for sanctions against Russia and collective defense. “Do not wait for dozens of ‘shaheds' and ballistic missiles before finally making decisions,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The suspected shooter, Desmond Holly, opened fire at the Denver-area high school on Wednesday, critically injuring two other students before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Before the shooting, Holly posted neo-Nazi views on his social media accounts and was active on online threads that depicted extremely graphic violence, the ADL's Center on Extremism said in a published analysis. Spokeswoman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office Jacki Kelley said in a media press conference that the suspect was “radicalized by some extremist network.” The sheriff's office did not specify which type of extremist network this was. “The details of that will be down the road, but we wanted to at least give you that much about maybe mindset for him,” Kelley said in the media press conference on Thursday. The ADL Center on Extremism report says Holly spent time on an online gore forum that has “served as a gateway” for three teenage school shooters, including Holly. He also posted content on his TikTok account that promoted white supremacist extremist language and imagery and idealized other school shooters, such as the perpetrators of the Columbine High School shooting in 1999. Columbine High School is also located in Jefferson County. According to the ADL report, Holly posted imagery on his TikTok and X pages of himself wearing a shirt he created to mimic one of the Columbine attackers, of a revolver and ammunition hours before the shooting, and of a skull mask he wore adorned with antisemitic and school-shooting related language. The Evergreen High School shooting came on the same day that 22-year-old Tyler Robinson allegedly assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah. It also came two weeks after two children and 17 others were wounded by suspected 23-year-old transgender gunman Robin Westman in the Annunciation Catholic School shooting in Minnesota.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hunter Biden filed a motion on Saturday calling for the arrest of former Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne amid a defamation lawsuit for which Byrne has not appeared in court. Biden's attorneys filed the motion for a bench warrant Saturday, roughly two years after Biden filed suit against Byrne. This most recent filing alleges that Byrne has refused to provide a physical address or email address, so Biden's attorneys have been unable to contact Byrne in order to complete the discovery process in the case. “Defendant is a billionaire who ignores court orders while concealing his assets overseas or in cryptocurrencies specifically created to evade governmental authority and who flouts this Court's authority,” the motion read. This case centers on an interview Byrne gave to the Capitol Times Magazine, in which he alleges that he visited the Middle East in 2021. Byrne claimed he was made aware of Biden allegedly meddling in Iranian affairs, but did not cite a source. “Hunter Biden was reaching out to the Iranian government in the fall of 2021 with the following offer: You Iranians have $8 billion frozen in a bank account in South Korea. My father will unfreeze it in return for $800 million being funneled into a numbered account for us,” Byrne is quoted in the article. Since then, Byrne has continued to post about the case on X. Let us see how much more prison time I can get you.” I understand  am going to be deposing you in about three weeks? Let us see how much more prison time I can get you. Byrne was deposed by Abbe Lowell, the attorney Biden hired during his special counsel investigation and gun charges in Wilmington, Delaware. Since then, Biden fired Lowell and replaced him with Richard Harpootlian, who previously represented convicted killer Alex Murdaugh. Byrne is also in the middle of a lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems, which is accusing the former CEO of allegedly manufacturing and promoting false evidence claiming that Dominion machines were rigged to manipulate the results of the 2020 election. The litigation has been going on for four years. In August 2019, Byrne resigned as CEO of Overstock after his comments about the “deep state” involved in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A California bill that would allow the state to fine large social media companies millions of dollars if they amplify violent or extremist content has ignited a free speech fight, pitting Big Tech against those who argue more accountability is needed. The state legislature, in which Democrats hold a supermajority, passed California Senate Bill 771 Thursday night and is headed to Gov. If he does, it could create a messy, drawn-out legal battle with multibillion-dollar tech companies over what people can post on their platforms. Supporters of the bill claim it is much-needed protection against groups that have been given space on social media to spew hateful rhetoric. The bill would also implement a separate “civil penalty” fine of up to $500,000 for reckless violations. A fact sheet provided to the Washington Examiner by Stern's office claimed violence, threats, and intimidation targeting certain historically vulnerable populations, such as Jewish people, women, immigrants, people of color, and those in the LGBT community, are at “historic highs and rising at record-shattering rates.” His office cited a recent study from Harvard that found a causal relationship between widespread violence against historically targeted groups and the practices of social media platforms. “Notwithstanding the escalating danger, social media platforms have announced dramatic retreats in screening and moderation practices to protect targeted populations,” Stern's office claimed. “Yet the tech companies that control this space are failing us, and the cost of their failure is measured not just in misinformation and division, but also — increasingly — lost lives.” Khaykin, who testified before the California State Assembly in support of SB771, called it a “critical step toward finally holding tech companies accountable for amplifying hate, extremism and disinformation.” “Our latest report paints a dire picture: Most major platforms, including Facebook, X, TikTok, YouTube, Amazon Music and Truth Social, received failing or near-failing grades — Ds and Fs dominate,” Khaykin said. “This failure underscores a hard truth: self-regulation is no regulation at all. Voluntary measures are no match for profit-driven algorithms that thrive on outrage, hate and division.” This means that larger platforms, which have a greater impact, will face more severe penalties if they fail to uphold the standards set by Stern's legislation.” “It's essential that we protect users online, but SB 771 is not the right approach,” said Aodhan Downey, state policy manager for CCIA. “This bill opens the door for bad actors to disproportionately pressure online corporations into silencing free speech to reduce their financial liability, with no protections for users against those mechanisms,” Oussama Mokeddem, CAIR-CA legislative and government affairs director, said. “It does nothing to address the actual drivers of anti-black racism, Islamophobia, and white supremacist violence. Instead, it risks chilling dissenting voices—particularly those advocating for Palestinian human rights—under the guise of combating hate.” “Under this bill, any form of showing content to users would make the companies liable for user speech. She said the bill also has not defined how social media companies can “knowingly promote hate.” By only penalizing companies with $100 million or more in annual gross profits, the bill could have the opposite effect and send users to smaller social media platforms like 4chan, which has a reputation for allowing more extreme views and content, Weissmann said.</p>

Your Mileage May Vary is an advice column offering you a unique framework for thinking through your moral dilemmas. To submit a question, fill out this anonymous form. Here's this week's question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity: The Jewish High Holidays are coming up, and that includes Yom Kippur. It's a holiday that encourages people to reflect on their behavior and make amends. That's all well and good, but I'm someone who struggles with scrupulosity — constantly worrying about my morality and if I'm doing The Most Possible Good™. In practice this is far more paralyzing than motivating. Fixating on the ethical implications of all possible decisions makes it harder to take any action, and I've lost hours scouring my memories of my past behavior for immorality like a football player watching footage of their games to analyze what they could do differently. Guilt simply isn't serving me, but I worry that saying to hell with all that means I'll stop striving to be a better person and become morally complacent. I've observed Yom Kippur for decades, and don't want to simply avoid the day. But the holiday is a moral scrupulosity trigger. How do you think I should approach this? I want to stop feeling guilty for letting guilt get in my own way. Have you ever heard the story about what happened when God decided to give the Bible to flesh-and-blood human beings? They argued that humans were deeply flawed mortals who didn't deserve such a holy scripture; only angels could be worthy of it, so it should stay up in heaven. He asked them: What do you angels need the Bible for? The Bible says to honor your father and mother — but you don't have parents, so how could you ever do that? Angels are really great at one thing: being perfect. God gives the Bible to humans not to make them into angels — but to make them better at being the unique thing they are: human animals, with feelings, flaws, and all, that can learn to use their capabilities in more beautiful ways. Feel free to email me at sigal.samuel@vox.com or fill out this anonymous form! Newsletter subscribers will get my column before anyone else does and their questions will be prioritized for future editions. I think there's a lot of wisdom in this story. And I want you to notice how far it is from demanding that humans do “The Most Possible Good™.” That language suggests a maximizing ethical theory like utilitarianism, which says that we have to do the action that produces the greatest good for the greatest number. In other words, we have to optimize. We each hold multiple values, and sometimes those values are in tension with each other, forcing us to strike a balance as best we can. We're not omniscient beings who can know with certainty how best to strike the balance. What's more, sometimes different kinds of moral good straight-up conflict with each other. We can't say because the options are incommensurable. There's no single yardstick by which to measure them so we can't compare them to find out which is greater. Given that this complexity is baked into the human condition, it's impossible to be a perfect optimizing machine. And the more you try to force yourself to be that, the harder it'll be for you to actually help others, because you'll just be so burned out. And a lot of the time, there's no knowably best decision. So instead of trying to optimize everything, you can adopt a goal that's humbler but more realistic: to live in line with your values as best you can. The unspoken premise is that if you optimize, you'll never have to ask yourself: How could I screw up that badly? It's about leaning into the fact that we are imperfect and vulnerable creatures and that even when we're trying our hardest there will be some things that we do not do optimally. Of course, we should still try to live in line with our values. But in those moments when we fall short, we shouldn't berate ourselves, thinking, “I sinned!” In Hebrew, the word we typically translate as “to sin” (lachto) actually means “to miss the mark.” It's the same word we'd use to describe someone with a bow and arrow who's targeting the bullseye but misses it slightly. This is a useful image, because it reminds us just how normal it is to miss the mark. I know what you're thinking: What if adopting this mindset means you'll become morally complacent and let yourself off the hook too easily? This is one of the most common objections to practicing self-compassion. In fact, psychologists have found that more self-compassionate people are better able to acknowledge when they've made a mistake. And they try to do better the next time around. Because, to them, mistakes don't feel so psychologically damning. That allows them to take more — not less — responsibility for their actions. Yom Kippur can feel terrifying when any mistake you've made over the past year seems damning. After all, it was on Yom Kippur that Moses descended from Mount Sinai carrying the second set of tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments, ready to gift them to the people. You probably know what happened to the first set of tablets: Moses shattered them after seeing the Israelites engaged in idol worship. Why did God think breaking them was the right move? And what was different about the second set? In other words, God recognized that you can't just give humans a list of moral rules and call it a day. Maybe that would work for angels, who live in a simplified, disembodied world, but our ethical life is just too messy and multifaceted to be captured by any single set of universally binding moral principles. Yet God chose people over angels anyway, inviting us into the collaboration and embracing our humanness rather than rejecting it. So, to the rabbis, Yom Kippur was a happy day because they fully expected that God would accept and embrace messy humans. Please, don't try to be more zealous than God. But once you've released the arrow from your bow, let it be. You do not have access to a magical mathematical formula that can consider countless incommensurable variables and spit out the very best move with certainty. Let it be good enough for you, too.
