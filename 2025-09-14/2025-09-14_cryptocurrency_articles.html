                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Initial jobless claims rose 27,000 to 263,000 — the highest since October 2021. Higher inflation and fewer jobs are not great for the U.S. economy, so it's no surprise that the word "stagflation" is starting to creep back into macroeconomic commentary. Against this backdrop, bitcoin—considered a risk asset by Wall Street—continued grinding higher, topping $116,000 on Friday and almost closing the CME futures gap at 117,300 from August. Not a surprise, as traders are also bidding up the biggest risk assets: equities. So how should traders think about BTC's price chart? To this chart enthusiast, price action remains constructive, with higher lows forming from the September bottom of $107,500. The 200-day moving average has climbed to $102,083, while the Short-Term Holder Realized Price — often used as support in bull markets — rose to a record $109,668. Strategy (MSTR) has underperformed bitcoin year-to-date and continues to hover below its 200-day moving average, currently $355. At Thursday's close of $326, it's testing a key long-term support level seen back in September 2024 and April 2025. The company's mNAV premium has compressed to below 1.5x when accounting for outstanding convertible debt and preferred stock, or roughly 1.3x based solely on equity value. Preferred stock issuance remains muted, with only $17 million tapped across STRK and STRF this week, meaning that the bulk of at-the-money issuance is still flowing through common shares. According to the company, options are now listed and trading for all four perpetual preferred stocks, a development that could provide additional yield on the dividend. The CME's FedWatch tool shows traders expect a 25 basis-point U.S. interest-rate cut in September and have priced in a total of three rate cuts by year-end. That's a sign risk sentiment could tilt back toward growth and crypto-linked equities, underlined by the 10-year U.S. Treasury briefly breaking below 4% this week. Still, the dollar index (DXY) continues to hold multiyear support, a potential inflection point worth watching. BitMEX Co-Founder Arthur Hayes Sees Money Printing Extending Crypto Cycle Well Into 2026 Hayes told Kyle Chassé that governments will keep printing money, fueling crypto well into 2026, while urging bitcoin investors to take a longer view.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ratio compares the price of ETH to BTC; a higher ratio indicates ETH is gaining strength against BTC, while a lower ratio signals weak ETH. The Ether-Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) ratio, which measures the price of Ether (ETH) against the price of Bitcoin (BTC), has failed to reclaim 0.05, despite adoption of ETH by institutions and the historic price rally in July and August that took ETH to new all-time highs. The ratio fell to a 5-year low in March, collapsing to 0.02, amid macroeconomic uncertainty and rising trade tensions between the United States and its trading partners. Ether's price hit a series of highs in August, reaching an all-time high of $4,957 on August 24, before dropping by about 6.7% to the current price level. Related: Ether breaks out against BTC, but new highs depend on $4.7K becoming support Ether has outperformed BTC only 15% of the time since its launch in 2015, according to market analyst James Check. However, since 2020, BTC has outperformed ETH, according to a price history analysis shared by Check in April. Market analysts are forecasting when Ethereum will reach the $5,000 milestone, which it narrowly missed in August by about $43 before retracing to current levels. “With ETH near its previous ATHs, we may consolidate for a bit, given the very large run-up in such a short time frame,” Jake Kennis, an analyst at blockchain analytics and research company Nansen, told Cointelegraph during the August rally. The analyst said that it may take weeks or months for ETH to hit new all-time highs following the heated price rally in August.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While market analysts debate whether Solana price prediction models support a genuine challenge to Ethereum's dominance, a revolutionary Layer 2 blockchain called Layer Brett is quietly building the infrastructure that could render this debate obsolete. Layer Brett's presale has already raised over $3.5 million, offering early investors the chance to stake $LBRETT tokens at an extraordinary 700+% APY while positioning for potential 100x gains. Recent Solana price prediction models paint an optimistic picture, with some analysts projecting SOL could reach $1,314 following current breakout patterns. Galaxy Digital's massive $700 million accumulation demonstrates institutional confidence, while SOL trades near $240 with consistent 5-6% gains. However, these bullish signals mask fundamental limitations that constrain long-term growth potential. SOL's network congestion issues during high-demand periods expose scalability challenges that institutional adoption will only amplify. While Galaxy's CEO calls Solana “tailor-made” for financial markets, the reality is that even optimistic Solana price prediction scenarios struggle to account for the technical debt accumulating as transaction volume increases. The Ethereum ecosystem's entrenchment presents SOL with a challenge that transcends mere technical specifications. Despite Solana's speed advantages, Ethereum's developer ecosystem, institutional partnerships, and protocol maturity create switching costs that even the most bullish Solana price prediction cannot overcome through price appreciation alone. Forward Industries' $1.65 billion raise supporting Galaxy's SOL accumulation reflects confidence in Solana's current trajectory, but institutional money follows infrastructure stability over revolutionary potential. Layer Brett recognizes this dynamic by building on Ethereum's foundation while delivering the speed and cost advantages that make SOL attractive to traders seeking alternatives. The project's unique positioning as both a memecoin and serious infrastructure play creates asymmetric upside that traditional Solana price prediction models cannot match. Early $LBRETT investors can stake tokens immediately at 700+% APY, generating passive income while participating in Layer Brett's ecosystem development. Where SOL targets institutions and Ethereum brings complexity, Layer Brett merges grassroots meme culture with real Layer 2 functionality—producing viral momentum that legacy networks find impossible to recreate. Through its $1 million giveaway campaign, Layer Brett further showcases dedication to fostering community bonds, and by maintaining a decentralized structure with zero KYC requirements, it delivers the accessibility that corporate-minded platforms like SOL simply can't match. While SOL may achieve short-term price targets, Layer Brett's combination of Ethereum security, superior speed, and community-driven growth creates the mathematical foundation for sustained exponential returns. Smart money is gravitating toward presale opportunities that offer both immediate staking rewards and long-term infrastructure positioning before mainstream adoption makes early entry impossible.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ETH is now increasingly being viewed as a long-term strategic asset. The Ethereum network has been on a positive roll for some time, with its momentum extending beyond on-chain activities to increased adoption. Analysts at the crypto research firm CryptoQuant noted in their weekly report that Ethereum has come a long way since spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were approved. Like bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) is now increasingly being viewed as a long-term strategic asset. This has led to higher demand from market participants. According to CryptoQuant, demand from institutional investors and large holders drove ether's recent rally from $1,400 in April 2025 to nearly $5,000 in late August. Ethereum holdings by U.S. spot ETFs have risen to an all-time high (ATH) of 6.7 million ETH. Likewise, addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH have scooped up roughly six million tokens within the same time period. The consistent accumulation has taken their holdings to new highs of 20.6 million ETH. “This level of institutional endorsement provides a robust long-term tailwind for Ethereum's price and perceived legitimacy,” analysts explained. Besides rising demand, selling pressure on ETH has eased up. Daily inflows have fallen from 1.8 million in mid-August to 750,000 ETH currently. Additionally, the amount of ETH staked has surged since May, hitting a record 36.2 million. Smart contract calls have also reached new levels, surpassing previous cycles with 12 million daily interactions. CryptoQuant analysts say such activity growth highlights Ethereum's growing role as a programmable settlement layer supported by decentralized finance (DeFi) and asset tokenization.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum (ETH) is back in the spotlight as it consolidates around $4,640 after a strong move up from its base at $4,070 in early September. One of the most significant bullish factors for Ethereum is its supply squeeze. Exchange reserves have dropped to 18.8 million ETH, the lowest level since 2016, and staking activity has surged, with over 36 million ETH (approximately 30% of the supply) now staked. ETH is leaving EXCHANGES at the fastest pace ever!🚨Reserves just plunged to 17.2M ETH!🔸 ~25M in 2023🔸 Down 30%+ in <2 years➡️ The sell-side inventory is evaporating. This reduces circulating supply, tightens liquidity, and puts upward pressure on price. Analysts also note that whale wallets and institutions have been quietly accumulating ETH, adding to the confidence in Ethereum's long-term. From a technical perspective, the Ethereum price prediction is slightly bullish as ETH is in an ascending channel, with price action making higher lows and testing the channel's upper boundary. The breakout above $4,450 was confirmed by long green candles, a bullish engulfing pattern. RSI has cooled from 69 to 60, so there's room for consolidation without weakness. A spinning top or Doji candle could form here, indicating market indecision before the next move. A daily close above $4,760 would likely lead to $4,945 and then $5,135, the level where previous rallies stalled. Ethereum's On-Balance Volume (OBV) recently flashed an accumulation signal before the recent move. Volume is up 12.26% in 24 hours to $43.4 billion, confirming the momentum. With institutional accumulation, shrinking exchange reserves and strong technicals all lining up, Ethereum may be about to make a big move. Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining BTC's unmatched security with Solana's high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. The presale has already crossed $15.6 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Analysts are highlighting ETH USD priming to retest $4,700 – and amid the upside pressure – is dark money rotating into Ethereum? The hacker who stole $300M+ from #Coinbase users bought another 3,976 $ETH($18.9M) at $$4,756 an hour ago.https://t.co/xgGLej7nrd pic.twitter.com/WrxobUkK7k Arkham Intelligence data shows the wallet aggregated DAI in amounts ranging from $80,000 to $6 million before swapping. The address has also been active recently, picking up 4,863 ETH and 649 ETH in July and around $8 million worth of Solana in August. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT estimated that the broader scheme drained at least $330 million from victims earlier this year. Below is a table we created which shows $65M stolen from Coinbase users in Dec 2024 – Jan 2025. The operation, described as a wide-scale social engineering campaign, targeted Coinbase users and has kept the wallet under close surveillance from on-chain analysts. Ethereum is showing renewed strength, with technical signals pointing to a possible breakout that could send prices toward $5,500. As per Tradingview data, ETH trades near $4,660, holding above its short-term moving averages on the 4-hour chart. This setup suggests buyers remain in control despite minor pullbacks. The broader structure shows a recovery trend after weeks of sideways action. Short-term candles reveal brief dips followed by fresh buying, a sign of steady demand. If not, price risks sliding back to the $4,400-$4,300 zone, where both moving averages converge. Analyst Titan of Crypto pointed to an Adam & Eve double-bottom pattern on the daily chart. This adds weight to the view that Ethereum could be setting up for a more substantial rally if buying pressure holds. CoinGlass data puts ETH futures open interest near $64Bn, while funding rates last session hovered around 0.01% across major exchanges, steady, but not excessive. On Sept. 12, after several days of outflows, Farside Investors reported net inflows into US ETH funds, pointing to fresh institutional demand.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Digital Asset Treasury firms are the new big trend in crypto. Companies such as Strategy and Metaplanet have risen to industry stardom and stock market success after becoming Bitcoin (BTC) treasuries. Other institutions have been scrambling to rebrand publicly traded firms or launch entirely new ones to become Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies. This new wave of publicly traded firms that are actively stacking gigantic sums of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptos are collectively referred to as Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies. DATs are publicly traded entities that raise capital, typically via share sales or bonds, specifically to fuel and support the acquisition, holding, and management of one or more digital assets as a core part of their balance sheet strategy. They can also generate revenues through various means, such as borrowing and lending services, operating validator nodes, DeFi protocols, etc. Essentially, they've investment vehicles that provide indirect exposure to crypto via traditional markets. According to CoinGecko data , 104 Bitcoin treasury companies hold a combined 1,013,608 BTC worth $115.5 billion The largest is Michael Saylor's Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which pioneered the crypto treasury strategy model in 2020 and now holds 631,460 BTC  worth $72.64 billion. After Bitcoin's remarkable rise in value, an increasing number of firms have begun looking to the world's number two token, Ethereum, which is now a rising star amongst institutions. According to CoinGecko data , just 11 companies are actively acquiring Ethereum. That said, they collectively hold 3,436,285 ETH worth $15.23 billion. Not far behind it is SharpLink, which has been aggressively acquiring tokens and now commands 837,230 ETH worth $3.69 billion. According to CoinGecko data , there are 7 publicly traded Solana treasury companies. Leading the competition is DeFi Development Corp, which currently commands 2,027,817 SOL worth $458.4 million. In second and third place are Upexi with 2,000,518 SOL, and Sharps Technology with 2,000,000 SOL; each is valued at around $452 million. Several other altcoin treasuries have been established, mostly this year. Then there's Dogecoin (DOGE), the world's most valuable and beloved memecoin, which also has  two treasury firms behind it. Up next is the native token for decentralized exchange (DEX) and Layer-1 blockchain, HyperLiquid (HYPE). It has just one publicly traded company backing it, Lion Group Holding, which currently has 128,929 HYPE tokens worth $7.03 million.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Currently priced at $25.27, LINK has seen a surge in investor confidence after surpassing a major milestone in total value secured (TVS), which has now crossed $100 billion across decentralized finance platforms. According to DeFiLlama, lending giant Aave contributes the largest share of this TVS, holding over $70.9 billion, accounting for 70.75% market dominance. From a technical standpoint, Chainlink has found strong support at $21, where key indicators like the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, Bollinger Bands midpoint, and value area high align perfectly. Analysts predict that maintaining this price could cause an increase to $26 and maybe $30. Currently trading around $0.947, ADA's recent price movement hints at the possibility of a larger wave five rally that could push it past the $1 mark. Analyst Quinten recently shared a chart showing that Cardano has been following a five-wave price pattern since its June low of $0.511. According to his analysis, ADA is nearing the end of its fourth wave. Meanwhile, Bitcoinsensus analysts have set their target slightly higher, at $1.860. Adding to this, data revealed that Cardano whales have purchased over 20 million ADA tokens in the past 24 hours, signaling renewed confidence. Remittix is quickly emerging as the best altcoin to buy now, thanks to its unique use case and impressive growth. The project also has its first CEX listings on BitMart and LBANK. One of the most exciting features of Remittix is its Beta Wallet, set to launch on September 15th, 2025, which will give users a first-hand experience of how seamless and efficient RTX-powered transfers will be. This unique incentive not only encourages community growth but also gives participants a way to increase their holdings at no extra cost. For investors seeking the best altcoins to buy now, Chainlink, Cardano, and Remittix present three very different but highly promising paths to profit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Polymarket launching instant Bitcoin prediction markets is a game changer in the crypto world. Let's dive into how this all works and what it means for investors. Blockchain payments are at the core of Polymarket's instant Bitcoin prediction markets. They're using smart contracts to make sure everything is executed smoothly and securely. No need for middlemen; that cuts down on counterparty risk and makes users a bit more comfortable. Plus, instant settlements are crucial when every second can impact profitability. By teaming up with Chainlink, Polymarket is adding a solid layer of reliability to prediction markets. Chainlink's decentralized oracle tech provides data feeds that make market resolutions more accurate. Because of this integration, Polymarket can settle trades within 15 minutes, which is a game changer. Decentralized oracles play a vital role in making sure market outcomes are legit. Chainlink pulls data from various sources, reducing the risks of relying on just one. This enhances the accuracy of predictions and ensures that market resolutions are based on real-world data. For fintech startups, adopting similar decentralized oracle solutions could significantly enhance the reliability of their crypto business payout systems. Polymarket's model taps into collective insights, making short-term predictions more accurate. This active participation boosts market liquidity and the overall reliability of predictions. Fintech startups should focus on building platforms that encourage user involvement to drive better market outcomes. However, instant settlements come with their own set of regulatory hurdles. They require trades to be fully funded upfront, which could limit flexibility. Plus, fast transactions could complicate fraud detection and compliance with AML regulations. Integrating Chainlink's oracle tech into Polymarket's instant Bitcoin prediction markets is a significant step in the crypto space. By boosting market reliability and efficiency, this could usher in a new era of trading dynamics. The future of prediction markets is bright, possibly reshaping how we engage with financial predictions and transactions.
