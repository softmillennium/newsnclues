                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In response to the scheduled FIFA World Cup 2026 events, Atlanta's Mayor Andre Dickens has taken an administrative step meant to reduce the impact on locals. The mayor signed an Executive Order that puts a limit on certain permits associated with the international soccer tournament, according to an official announcement from the City of Atlanta. As the world turns its eyes to Atlanta for this event, the Executive Order, in its design, intends to balance the excitement of hosting an international spectacle with reality—the continuance of everyday life, marked by personal celebrations and local happenings. Details from the official statement acknowledge that, for residents, "life still goes on for our residents—birthdays, anniversaries, annual events and other special occasions." Mayor Dickens' approach reflects a broader strategy by the City Administration to foster an inclusive environment where residents can choose how to interact with the World Cup festivities. The Executive Order aims to give stakeholders ample time to develop plans that align with residents' preferences and needs around this landmark event. "The Administration's goal is that all of Atlanta can experience and engage with FIFA World Cup 2026 in the way of their own choosing," City of Atlanta affirmed in the recent news release.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Messi was largely contained by Charlotte and Miami looked rudderless without suspended striker Suarez on the pitch Lionel Messi missed a penalty and the wheels quickly came off for Inter Miami as they slumped to a second straight 3-0 defeat, falling Saturday night to surging Charlotte FC. Miami started well, pushing higher up the pitch than usual and creating early chances. Jordi Alba forced Kristijan Kahlina into a point-blank save in the sixth minute, and the Herons continued to press until earning their first MLS penalty of the season in the 31st minute. With regular taker Luis Suárez suspended for his role in a Leagues Cup brawl against Seattle, Messi stepped up. Seconds later, Charlotte punished the miss when Idan Toklomati capped off a blistering counterattack to put the hosts ahead. Early in the second half, Wilfried Zaha sliced through Miami's defense on the flank and set up the Israeli striker for his second. In the 84th minute, Zaha drew a penalty from Sergio Busquets and, in a show of generosity, handed the ball to Toklomati to complete his first MLS hat-trick. Miami, meanwhile, are now winless in three of their last four. GOAL rates Inter Miami's players from Bank of America Stadium.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fans will be on the edge of their seats on Super Sunday, as Pep Guardiola's Manchester City take on Ruben Amorim's Manchester United in a massive Premier League encounter. The 197th Manchester derby has the potential to set a precedent for what is to come this season – as two struggling sides compete for regional supremacy. Having won their first four games across the past two seasons, this is unfamiliar territory for Guardiola and Co. For Amorim, the pressure continues to mount – especially considering his flailing record in terms of consistency in the league. Let's look at the best odds – via BetMGM: Considering the attacking threat of both setups, there is a likelihood of a goal fest on Sunday. With big names such as Erling Haaland, Bruno Fernandes and Bernardo Silva set to feature, one can expect some goals and thrills. Moreover, the defensive weaknesses of City and United are glaring in nature. While the 2023-24 champions are struggling with their defensive shape, the Reds will be desperate to put an end to their goalkeeper conundrum. Pick: Over 9.5 Shots on Target at -110 (via BetMGM) City likes to engage in patient build-up play and carefully crafted transitions, making their corner count relatively low. On the contrary, United's intent and ability to cause chaos/disruption in their attacking third will determine how the match unfolds. In a high stakes, high reward match-up like this, tensions and tempers are bound to flare up. In their most recent 0-0 draw during the 2024-25 campaign, a total of 5 yellow cards were handed out. The fact that both teams have players who tend to be on the rash side when it comes to challenges, makes this >3.5 at -150 a spot-on prediction.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a tournament compromised by wet weather and therefore boggy pitches, hosts West Germany were not overwhelmingly popular winners. Their 1972 European Championship-winning side had played open, expansive football, but that approach gave way to a more cautious, less spectacular approach here. “If Netzer plays as well as in 1972, the West German team, with players like Wolfgang Overath, Gerd Muller and Franz Beckenbauer will undoubtedly go far.” The same was true of the Dutch squad, and such situations have become something of a World Cup cliche, but in 1974 this was considered novel, and a sign that the sport had become overrun by financial interests, even at international level. Still, this contributed to a somewhat tepid level of support for the hosts, even on home soil, especially when combined with flat, uninspiring football in the group stage. Then, as with West Germany's previous World Cup triumph, there was a symbolic defeat. Whereas in 1954 it had been against Hungary, who West Germany eventually defeated in the final, here it was in a politically charged game against East Germany — the only full international between the sides — played amongst a huge security presence. But that doesn't explain the real story, which is that Schon was from Dresden, in East Germany, and fled to West Germany in 1950 because of political interference in East German football. He coached the Saarland ‘national' side during its period of French occupation, when the players were prevented from representing West Germany. “I wanted to be everything apart from a football manager,” he once said. “I realised early how difficult and often unrewarding the job could be, and how it depends upon so many factors and circumstances over which even the best manager has little or no control.” His lowest point came midway through this tournament, and that chastening defeat to East Germany — a game Schon desperately wanted to win, for understandable reasons. Afterwards he locked himself away, was unable to conduct a press conference the following day, and was described as being on the verge of a breakdown. But the defeat forced Schon to adjust his side, and — perhaps like Spain's defeat by Switzerland in 2010 or Argentina's against Saudi Arabia in 2022 — was eventually considered a blessing in disguise, particularly as it put West Germany on the weaker half of the draw, in a tournament that featured a second group stage rather than quarter-finals and semi-finals. West Germany therefore had to finish above Sweden, Poland and Yugoslavia to reach the final, rather than Brazil, Argentina and the Netherlands. Beckenbauer is considered the best and most influential defender in football history — with the only reasonable argument against that status being that he wasn't really a defender at all. Originally renowned as an intelligent midfielder capable of driving forward into attack, Beckenbauer pioneered the role of the attacking sweeper, and future German midfield stars often copied him and dropped into that role. Four years beforehand, Brazil's Gerson was considered unconventional as a playmaker operating unusually far back, in front of the defence. But Beckenbauer was positioned even deeper than him. Spoken about as an exception to the system-first football dominating Europe during this period, Beckenbauer was considered a flair player who had freedom to do as he pleased, although he was sometimes criticised for his languid nature. He also started appearing alongside Schon at press conferences, taking the lead when it came to tactical questions. It was little surprise he later became the side's manager, and in 1990 he followed Mario Zagallo by becoming the second man to win the World Cup as both a player and a manager. Beckenbauer's role, starting as West Germany's spare defender and then dribbling forward into attack to create chances for teammates, was the key feature of this side. But it was also one small part of the overall approach, and at the time this side was spoken about in a similar sense to the Netherlands, just as European Champions Bayern Munich were considered comparable to Ajax. “It became clear just how close German football had become to Dutch football,” wrote Tobias Escher in his history of German football tactics, Vom Libero Zur Doppelsechs (From Libero To Double Pivot), of the 1972 side. While the 1974 side was not as entertaining, and was considered ageing need of younger legs — particularly at the start of the tournament — this was still a very fluid side. Vogts, incidentally, still had license to dribble forward, play a one-two and find himself through on goal in the first half. West Germany's players embraced that billing — to a certain extent. “I know that the expression has been used almost incessantly since about 1972, often by people who don't really know what it means,” said Grabowski. “Basically, ‘total football' is no magic formula, it simply means that every player should be allowed to attack and defend. In my view this concept will dominate the football scene for years to come.” Their passing network from the final shows Beckenbauer and Uli Hoeness — who played ahead of Overath and Bonhof in a midfield trio — as the key passers. The first time a West Germany player touched the ball in Munich was when goalkeeper Sepp Maier picked it out of his own net. But what was cast as a battle between Cruyff and Beckenbauer didn't play out that way. Neither had an outstanding game, with Cruyff largely kept quiet by Vogts. At the time, the Dutch were criticised for holding onto possession and slowing the game at 1-0, rather than going for more goals, although through a modern lens this seems a standard tactic. Similarly, the penalty for West Germany's equaliser was considered soft — Holzenbein was renowned for going to ground easily — but Wim Jansen dived in, and got nowhere near the ball, and it would be considered a stonewall penalty in 2025. “Perhaps the Dutch thought we would be easy after they scored that goal in the first minute,” Schon said afterwards. “But a match lasts 90 minutes and the better fighters won it.” Considering it was the winning goal in a memorable final, Muller's crucial strike shortly before half-time — a good shot on the turn, one of his specialisms — doesn't feel particularly famous compared to mere ‘clinching' goals scored in the 1966 and 1970 finals, for example. This goal took him clear of Just Fontaine and onto 14 World Cup goals, scored across 1970 and 1974, the most until he was overtaken by Ronaldo of Brazil (15) in 2006 and fellow German Miroslav Klose (16) in 2014. It must also be said that, for all the lamenting of the Netherlands' failure to win, West Germany — and Muller — were robbed of a clear goal in the second half due to an erroneous offside flag. But West Germany were closer to the Netherlands than many contemporary accounts would suggest, both in style and and ability. This really wasn't anything like 1954, when Hungary were clearly the strongest side and West Germany's win felt like a complete injustice. This was the Netherlands being defeated by a less flamboyant side, but one which offered technical skill, tactical quality and a sense of disciplined ruthlessness and defensive quality that all winning sides must possess. His colleague Eric Batty, in a typically downbeat assessment, referred to “a mediocre West German team… very fortunate winners… like England eight years ago, I doubt if they would be successful anywhere else in the world expect on West German soil.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“We want to compete for trophies,” said Nashville SC's head coach B.J. “And that's what this U.S. Open Cup is giving us the opportunity to do.” Every coach, in his position, would say something similar. It sits proudly, a symbol behind glass, to tell a shiny story of good days for as long as anyone cares about such things. There's something very human behind Callaghan's desire to lift a trophy into the air in early October. “You don't talk that way about Game 14 of the regular season. With controversy swirling around previous coach Gregg Berhalter, and doubts about how to move the program forward, Callaghan stepped up from assistant to interim head coach for 61 days, with a Concacaf Nations League right smack in the middle. Callaghan, who finished his tenure in charge of the USMNT without losing a single game, with four wins and three draws from seven, was right there at the heart of it all. “When it's going good, it's easy,” said Callaghan, quick to deflect credit for the Nations League success, claiming “there were a lot of things in place” when he was dropped into the hot seat. What makes me happiest when I think back on it is, when we were called on, in a really difficult time, we responded together and exceeded expectations.”Callaghan, who speaks often and earnestly about his desire to help bring people together, became a cult hero of American soccer in that summer of 2023. The Nashville coach, he of boyish smile and broad shoulders, laughs off such assertions – but it's still true. The original team-guy, you'll not find anyone with a bad word to say about him from his five years with the National Team staff or his six years before that with the Philadelphia Union, where he began his pro coaching career analyzing video.“B.J. is an amazing guy and I have a lot of respect for him – and he had a lot to say about the way we did things on the field,” said Alejandro Bedoya, who, in the late autumn of his playing career and still with Philly, will go head-to-head with Callaghan in the 2025 Open Cup Semifinal on September 16 at 8pm ET at Nashville's Geodis Park (LIVE on Paramount+ and on air at CBS Sports Network). It hasn't been all glory-days and trophy hoists for Callaghan. After starting out in the college game with his alma mater Ursinus College, where he was a standout DIII goalkeeper, and Villanova's men's and women's programs, he spent six years with the Union as an assistant. There, he was part of a club that reached three Open Cup Finals. “I was there for all three of those Finals and we lost them all,” he said, of those days working under long-time coach Jim Curtin, who won two Open Cups as a player with the Chicago Fire and “made sure everyone understood the history and meaning” of the tournament. “It was a first taste of how winning trophies is so rare, so difficult, and how, when you have an opportunity, you have to go all-in.” He still has vivid memories of those three Finals, when it was “right there at your fingertips.” From 2014: Hitting a post late and losing to Seattle in front of a full house at home. From 2015: Again at home, devastated by Sporting Kansas City in a shootout, Curtin swapping out goalkeepers for the post-game penalties, “because you have to expect the unexpected in those games.” Most recently, from 2018: Traveling to Houston “with the whole club staff, all as one” and losing to the Dynamo.Callaghan draws the nectar of positivity from getting to those Finals. “I think the Open Cup, with all its tradition and energy, just brings something special,” he said. “They take a lot of focus and preparation – the regular season disappears when you step into them.” “They're a really good team, a really deep team and one that shares our ambitions of wanting to lift the Open Cup.”With a squad that tries to “out-team” other teams, the 2025 Nashville SC squad is built in its coach's image. “We like to work for a purpose that's bigger than ourselves as individuals,” Callaghan insisted. “It's gonna' be a heavyweight battle,” Callaghan added. “I'm sure we can't even dream of some of the things that are going to happen in this one.” “You have to be brave because this is something that can bring everyone together, the whole city. “Maybe you're the ten year old kid who falls in love with Nashville Soccer Club that night,” added Callaghan, alive, always, to the joyful possibilities.Fontela is editor-in-chief ofusopencup.com.</p>
