                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The final stage of the Vuelta a Espana was suspended on Sunday after several large pro-Palestinian protests disrupted the premier cycling event in the Spanish capital Madrid, according to organizers. As witnessed by CNN, officers from Spain's National Police attempted to disperse the crowds occupying the final mile of the race route that led up to the finish line but were unsuccessful. Police deployed tear gas to try to clear people from the area, but several protesters clashed with police and formed barricades in the middle of the road, using the fences that had closed off the area as makeshift barriers. Organizers posted on social media late Sunday that the race had ended early for “security reasons,” and that there would be “no podium ceremony.” Several previous stages of the race held before Sunday had been shortened or changed because of similar protests against Israel's war in Gaza. “Unfortunately, these aspects continued in Madrid this afternoon, as protestors took to the finishing circuit around the Spanish capital. “There is no doubt that this was a difficult race for us, with everything we have been dealing with out on the road,” Impey said in the statement. Sunday's clashes came hours after Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he applauded the pro-Palestinian protesters who had disrupted the race. “Today marks the end of the Vuelta,” Sanchez told a Socialist party rally in the southern city of Malaga on Sunday. “Our respect and recognition for the athletes and our admiration for the Spanish people who are mobilizing for just causes like Palestine.” The Vuelta competition is Spain's top annual multi-stage professional road cycling race, composed of 21 stages that are completed in three weeks of competition.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fox News host Brian Kilmeade apologized on Sunday for saying days earlier that people who are experiencing homelessness and mental illnesses should be executed – remarks that prompted calls for him to be fired. Kilmeade's about-face came amid a climate in which people across the US are either being fired from or disciplined at their jobs amid a coordinated effort to clamp down on commentary that is critical about Turning Point USA's executive director, Charlie Kirk, who was shot to death at an event in Utah on Wednesday. Mere hours before the conservative political activist was killed, while on the rightwing Fox News program Fox & Friends, Kilmeade and two other hosts were discussing the killing of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian woman who was fatally stabbed on a commuter train in North Carolina in August. During the Fox and Friends appearance on Wednesday discussing Zarutska's death, co-host Lawrence Jones said unhoused people with mental illness should either accept the publicly funded programs to help in their situation or be jailed. Among those to respond was California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, who on social media posted a biblical verse reading: “Whoever closes his ear to the cry of the poor will himself call out and not be answered.” I am obviously aware that not all mentally ill, homeless people act as the perpetrator did in North Carolina – and that so many homeless people deserve our empathy and compassion.” Unlike others who were deemed to have made offensive comments about Kirk's death, Kilmeade remained employed by Fox News. His professional fate struck a sharp contrast with Dowd, a veteran political analyst fired by MSNBC for suggesting on air that Kirk's far-right rhetoric may have contributed to the violence that killed him. “Kilmeade is advocating for extrajudicial killings on FOX, yet Matthew Dowd was fired by MSNBC [for] pointing out Charlie Kirk's dangerous rhetoric,” author Shannon Watts said on X. “This moral asymmetry in the media and online is destroying democracy.” Studies show that people experiencing homelessness are more likely to be victims of violent crime than perpetrators. And other studies have shown that mental illness is not a predictor of future violence.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Israeli military struck multiple high-rise buildings in Gaza City on Sunday, after warning people to leave several neighborhoods, in the latest round of destruction since Israel ordered a complete evacuation of the city earlier this week. Israel's assault on Gaza City appeared to be accelerating, with the military issuing evacuation orders for several towers in Gaza City within just a few hours Sunday morning. The strikes came ahead of a meeting called by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss efforts to avoid harming the hostages still held in Gaza when the Israeli military undertakes a ground operation planned to take control of Gaza City, according to a source familiar with the matter. There are thought to be about 20 hostages still alive in the enclave, some of whom are believed to be in Gaza City. Among the buildings struck Sunday was Al Kawthar Tower near Gaza's port. Al Kawthar – an 11-story building – is one of several high-rises that have been destroyed or severely damaged by Israeli strikes since the IDF extended operations into Gaza City earlier this month and ordered nearly a million people in the area to head south. Hours later, after another warning was posted on X by the Israeli military, a multi-story building in Gaza City was struck but not demolished. Another building at the Islamic University in Gaza was struck and destroyed by several missiles, according to images and video from the scene. At least 74 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza on Saturday, hospital officials said, with more than 50 of those killed in Gaza City. Al Shati camp in Gaza City was targeted late Saturday, as Israeli strikes intensified. Videos of the aftermath show a large fire had broken out in an area where people were sheltering. Satellite images reveal wide destruction in Gaza City as Israel steps up assault CNN has recorded the destruction of at least a dozen high-rise buildings in central Gaza since September 5. The Palestinian health ministry said Sunday that 64,871 people had been killed in Gaza since Israeli military operations began after Hamas' attack on Israel in October 2023 – and 164,610 had been injured. On Sunday, he visited the Western Wall in the Old City of Jerusalem with Netanyahu and US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee. Rubio is scheduled to officially meet Netanyahu on Monday. The Israeli leader is expected to raise his government's potential West Bank annexation plans with Rubio, according to three Israeli sources. Also on Monday, the leaders of several Arab and Islamic countries are expected to attend an emergency summit in Doha as a show of support to Qatar, after Israel conducted a strike on its capital city earlier this week. Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said Sunday that the Israeli strikes will “not deter” it from continuing “sincere efforts” to mediate an end to the war in Gaza. “The barbaric and demagogic practices of Israel will not deter us from continuing to make sincere efforts with Egypt and the United States to stop this unjust war,” Al Thani said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israel's actions will not bar Qatar from continuing its mediatory efforts jointly with Eqyot and the United States to ultimately settle the conflict in the Gaza Strip, Qatari Prime Miniser and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani said, commenting on Israel's strike on Hamas leaders' residence in Doha. "Our policy is based on the firm conviction that a fair, comprehensive and lasting peace is a strategic choice. From this point of view, we state that Israel's disgusting and barbaric actions will not bar us from continuing our sincere efforts jointly with Egypt and the United States toward ending this unfair war in the Gaza Strip," he said at an extraordinary ministerial meeting of the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. He condemned the Israeli attack as a "dangerous escalation threatening regional peace and security and undermining any efforts toward stability in the Middle East". According to the Qatari prime minister, the attack on Doha should be seen as a state terrorism stemming from "the current extremist Israeli government's approach." A meeting of foreign ministers from Arab and Islamic countries began in Doha on Saturday. The meeting is expected to yield a draft resolution of the summit of the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation due to be held in Doha on September 15. Israel delivered a series of strikes on senior Hamas officials in Doha on September 9. The Palestinian movement reported the death of six people, including a son of Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip Khalil al-Hayya and a Qatari security officer. Hamas has not confirmed the death of its senior officials as of yet.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Utah governor, Spencer Cox, on Sunday told national talkshows that the man suspected of killing Turning Point USA executive director Charlie Kirk was living with and in a relationship with a person “transitioning from male to female” as investigators continue exploring a possible motive in the attack. Nonetheless, Cox stopped short of saying that officials had determined the suspect's partner's alleged status was a factor in Kirk's killing. In comments to NBC's Meet the Press, Cox said that Kirk's accused killer, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, was not cooperating with authorities. Yet authorities are gathering information from family members and people around him, Cox said. Cox said that what investigators had gathered showed Robinson “does come from a conservative family – but his ideology was very different than his family”. Citing the content of investigators' interviews with people close to Robinson, Cox said “we do know that the [suspect's] roommate … is a [partner] who is transitioning from male to female. “I will say that that person has been very cooperative with authorities,” Cox remarked to Meet the Press host Kristen Welker, referring to the roommate. The governor did not elaborate on the evidence that investigators were relying on to establish Robinson's relationship to his roommate with whom he shared an apartment in Washington county, Utah, about 260 miles from where Kirk was killed. Robinson's arrest was announced on Friday after he surrendered to authorities to end a two-day manhunt in the wake of the 31-year-old Kirk's killing. Utah records show both of his parents are registered Republicans who voted in the 2024 election that gave Donald Trump, their party's leader, a second presidency. But publicly available information offers little if any insight into Robinson's personal beliefs. The governor did not elaborate – though on Saturday, citing the work of law enforcement, he told the Wall Street Journal that “it's very clear to us and to investigators that this was a person who was deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology.” The governor replied, “That is what we are trying to figure out right now.” Yet Cox said he had not read all interview transcripts compiled by investigators, “so I just want to be careful … and so we'll have to wait and see what comes out.” Cox said he expected the public would learn more when formal charges were filed against Robinson. The governor said he expected that to happen on Tuesday. After Robinson's arrest, Utah officials said that inscriptions were found on bullet casings within a rifle found near the scene where Kirk was killed. Catch!” Another purportedly read, “Oh, Bella ciao” – a reference to an Italian anti-fascist resistance song. During his CNN appearance, Cox also said that investigators were looking into a potential note left by Robinson. He suggested additional details about the note could be “included in charging documents”. The FBI director, Kash Patel, posted a link Sunday on social media to an article that the conservative Fox News network published a day earlier that first relayed details of Robinson's alleged partner, citing senior-level agency officials. In an unrelated matter from three years earlier, Kirk had attacked Cox on social media over the topic of trans women in sports and called for him to be expelled from the Republican party. “Every American is harmed by this – it's an attack on an individual and an attack on a country whose entire purpose, entire way of being is that we can resolve what we need to resolve through a political process,” Pete Buttigieg, a Democrat who served as the US transportation secretary during Joe Biden's presidency, said to Welker.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hamas has said that its leadership was not taken out by the Israeli attack, which it described as an attempt to assassinate negotiators working on a potential settlement to the Gaza conflict. “The Hamas terrorists chiefs” in Doha have “blocked all ceasefire attempts in order to endlessly drag out the war,” Netanyahu claimed. “Getting rid of them would rid the main obstacle to releasing all our hostages and ending the war,” Netanyahu wrote on X on Saturday. They blocked all ceasefire attempts in order to endlessly drag out the war. Qatar has hosted several rounds of Israel-Hamas negotiations, mediating talks that led to two temporary ceasefires in the Gaza war, one in 2023 and another earlier this year. It has accused Israel of “state terrorism” after the attack on its territory. US President Donald Trump has also condemned the strike and distanced himself from it. “I view Qatar as a strong Ally and friend of the US, and feel very badly about the location of the attack,” he said on Tuesday, adding that it was solely Netanyahu's decision. “Every time they're making progress, it seems like he bombs someone,” the outlet cited a White House official as saying. Moscow has denounced the Israeli attack as a flagrant violation of international law and an attempt to derail the settlement process. Qatar plays a “key mediating role in indirect talks between Hamas and Israel,” and striking it could only be viewed as an attempt to undermine peace efforts, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday.</p>

Romanian Defence Minister Ionut Mosteanu said a single Russian drone flew low over the country's territory, and that two Romanian F-16s and two German Eurofighters had been close to opening fire when the drone disappeared from radar, likely turning back into Ukraine. Mr. Zelensky – who has expressed exasperation over NATO's reluctance to aid Ukrainian air defences by shooting down Russian drones that cross into their territory – wrote on social media that the drone had gone 10 kilometres deep into Romanian airspace, and operated there for 50 minutes. Poland also closed the airport in its eastern city of Lublin on Saturday in response to Russian drones flying over the adjacent regions of Ukraine. The drone that crossed into Romania was one of 58 that were launched at Ukrainian cities Saturday night, nearly all of which were shot down. The intrusion into Romanian airspace came the same week that an unprecedented 19 Russian drones flew into Poland, forcing Polish and Dutch fighter jets to shoot several down in the first-ever instance of NATO armies firing directly at Russian military hardware. What is Article 4, the treaty provision invoked by Poland after Russian drone incursions? On Friday, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte announced the start of a new military operation, Eastern Sentry, that will see additional fighter jets and air-defense systems deployed alliance's eastern frontier in Poland and the Baltic States. But remarks by U.S. President Donald Trump – who suggested the Russian incursion “could have been a mistake” – have underscored divisions within the alliance. In a separate social media posting on Saturday, Mr. Trump said he was willing to introduce “major” new sanctions on Russia, but only once NATO countries ended their purchases of Russian oil. He also called for NATO to collectively slap 50 to 100-per-cent tariffs on China, which has increased its trade with Russia to record levels since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, until the war is over. If not, you are just wasting my time, and the time, energy, and money of the United States,” he wrote, referring to the war in Ukraine, which Mr. Trump has made sputtering efforts to try to resolve. The drones were shot down over Poland's territory with help from NATO allies. Mr. Zelensky, whose country is not a member of NATO, and was invaded by Russia in 2022, made it clear that he was underwhelmed by NATO's reaction to the incursions. “NATO countries are mobilizing military aircraft – but a couple of days go by, and this ceases to be a topic of conversation. Let's be honest, none,” Mr. Zelensky told the annual Yalta European Strategy conference in Kyiv. Nobody wants to talk about that… we are simply warning that a strong response is needed.” Russia reported on Sunday that it had shot down 361 Ukrainian drones over the previous 24 hours, with an explosion and fire reported at an oil refinery in the Bashkortostan region, 1,400 kilometres from the Ukrainian border. “We hope the United States will join other allies in solidarity,” Mr. Sikorski said. This year's event was held under high security and extreme secrecy, with all reporting prohibited until the end of the two-day conference, when high-profile foreign guests had already departed Kyiv on Saturday. The conference included a salute to former Canadian prime minister Jean Chrétien, who – at the age of 91 – took an overnight train ride into a war zone to attend this year's event. Transport Minister Chrystia Freeland, a well-known figure in Kyiv due to her Ukrainian heritage, also made the trip and moderated several panels. Such inspirational words were undercut by the remarks of British historian Niall Ferguson, who said that many attendees seemed not to grasp that the U.S. was no longer actively supporting Ukraine. Mr. Ferguson told the conference that unless the European Union greatly increased its support for the war effort, he could see history repeating itself, with Russia “grinding out a victory,” while losing large numbers of people, just as it has in previous wars.

DONETSK, September 14. /TASS/. Russian troops are grinding elite units of the Ukrainian army in the Dobropolye area despite constant counterattacks, DPR head Denis Pushilin said.

"The salient made by our units in the Dobropolye direction remains. Of course, the enemy is constantly trying to counterattack or attack individual positions, trying to cut them off, but, nevertheless, our units are there. They continue to grind down enemy groups, including elite units," he said in an interview with VGTRK reporter Andrey Rudenko posted on his Telegram channel.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Charlie Kirk's alleged assassin was in a relationship with his transgender roommate, potentially shedding light on his motivation for killing Kirk if found guilty. Spencer Cox, the governor of Utah, said that Tyler Robinson, 22, who was arrested on suspicion of killing the conservative political activist, was living with a biological man transitioning to become a woman. Neighbours claimed to have seen Mr Robinson holding hands with his partner, who is also reported to be from a conservative Christian family. On Sunday, Mr Cox said: “We can confirm that his roommate was indeed a boyfriend who is transitioning from male to female.” He added that Mr Robinson was not co-operating with authorities while in custody. Early in the investigation, there were initial reports that the ammunition used to shoot Kirk was engraved with “transgender and anti-fascist ideology”. But it was later confirmed that the inscriptions did not explicitly reference transgenderism and instead alluded to ironic internet culture. No clear motive has been established in the investigation into Kirk's killing. In April 2024, he likened doctors who performed gender-affirming care to Nazis committing atrocities. However, photos and comments posted by his family suggest Mr Robinson may have in fact had Right-wing leanings. Josh Kemp, Mr Robinson's neighbour, claimed to have seen the alleged assassin walking hand-in-hand with another individual two weeks before Kirk's killing. The neighbour claimed he also saw them kissing and heard them discussing a doctor's appointment, which he believed was related to the roommate's transition to becoming a woman. A family member told the FBI that Mr Robinson had grown increasingly political in recent years, accusing Kirk of “spreading hate” during a recent family dinner. Another was scrawled with lyrics referencing Bella Ciao, a Second World War Italian anti-fascist song. Mr Cox said: “Friends have confirmed that there was kind of that deep, dark internet, the Reddit culture, and these other dark places of the internet where this person was going deep.” During a press conference on Friday, investigators revealed that Mr Robinson had shared messages with his roommate in which he discussed the bullet engravings, as well as plans to retrieve and stash a rifle. In the woods near campus, officers retrieved a high-powered, bolt-action rifle containing one spent cartridge and three more, unused rounds. The roommate was said to have helped investigators by sharing Mr Robinson's messages with them. He told Fox News: “The last message that Charlie Kirk gave to me before he joined his creator in heaven was he said that we have to dismantle and take on the radical Left organisations in this country that are fomenting violence.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Maintaining power as you age helps support muscle and metabolic health.francescoridolfi.com/iStockPhoto / Getty Images I hadn't attempted this in 20 years but somehow expected to pull it off. He watched as I kicked off explosively and caught about an inch of air before falling back to earth with a thud. Our sense of aging doesn't progress smoothly over time; we piece it together through moments such as these. And there is a fairly predictable list of physical changes that take place as we get older. One of the steepest drop-offs is how fast you can move something, whether it's your own body or a weighted implement. The term is muscle power (work divided by time) and it can be conspicuous in its absence. Is it a myth that seniors need to slow down their fitness routines? Between 0.4 and 2.5 metres a second, if you're tracking. Speed and power athletes – the kind you'd see in a decathlon event – are far rarer in that age group. … With aging, both of these systems are going to be deteriorating," says Michael Paris, a researcher at York University who studies the relationship between muscle and aging. “Within the nervous system, the brain and spinal cord of older adults may have a reduced and more inconsistent ability to activate the muscle in a co-ordinated manner, especially during fast or forceful contractions, which again will contribute to the loss of muscle power with aging.” But do these physical changes come because we stop moving fast? Or do we stop moving fast because of these physical changes? It's a chicken-or-the-egg kind of situation, Paris says. To get some insight on the athletic side of things, I reached out to coach Derek Evely, whose athletes, including Canadian Olympian Dylan Armstrong, have earned more than 70 national and international medals in throwing events. Throwing sports – such as shot put and hammer throw – have the highest technical demands of all track and field activities, Evely explained. Technique takes time, and skill can be the bottleneck in expressing power, not raw horsepower. “That's why throwers can compete at a higher level so much longer than everybody else. For aging and fitness, community is the most important part Aging well has more to do with functional abilities, such as getting up from the floor (albeit not with a kip-up). However, maintaining power supports muscle and metabolic health. “Muscle power – the ability to generate force or contract in a quick and forceful manner – is really important for older adults and their ability to move around the world,” Paris says. And there's no point where hope is truly lost, he adds. Older adults who stay in motion lose power at a slower rate than their counterparts; even 100-year-olds can improve their muscle power with dedicated exercise. Movements that work on muscle power, like jumping, are great to incorporate into your regular exercise routine.bernardbodo/Getty Images Jumping: Paris recommends targeting the quads and front abdominal muscles in particular. Working up to five minutes of daily jumping is one evidence-based option. There's no rush,” says Greg Lehman, a pain and rehab expert. Five sets of 10 jumps can work when performed near daily. You could argue this is a pretty good intervention.” Start slow: You should build a base of strength for six to eight weeks before adding fast movements, Lehman says. Paris suggests going beyond your body weight for explosive movements and adding weight, in the ballpark of 60 to 70 per cent of your one-rep max (the most weight you can move once). Training for power also means terminating the set before movement slows down – something that happens before you even register feeling tired. Specificity is key, and training for power doesn't mix well with fatigue. © Copyright 2025 The Globe and Mail Inc. All rights reserved.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian forces have regained control of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast village of Filia, briefly occupied by Russian troops during their incursion into the region, Dnipro Operational Strategic Group Spokesperson Oleksii Bielskyi said on Sept. 13. As part of its summer offensive, Russia has been attempting to break into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a previously unoccupied region of Ukraine. Units of Ukraine's 425th Skelya Regiment restored Ukrainian control over Filia, Bielskyi said during a television broadcast Sept. 13. "Good news today… Filiia in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast has been liberated from the enemy," he said. "The occupiers had planted their rag of a flag. Russia claimed to have captured Filia on Aug. 24, Ukraine's Independence Day. The battlefield monitoring site DeepState has also consistently marked Filia as under Ukrainian control. It is unclear when Russian troops occupied the village. Russian forces have previously attempted to enter the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast village of Dachne on several occasions, but the Ukrainian military maintains they were repelled. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian state media in June that Russian forces were conducting operations in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast as part of efforts to create a so-called "buffer zone" on Ukrainian territory. Dnipropetrovsk Oblast suffers daily Russian aerial and artillery attacks and borders Donetsk Oblast, a focal point of Russia's invasion since 2014 and a major battleground since the full-scale invasion in 2022.

"These railway lines are critical supply routes for Russian forces operating in the Kharkiv and Sumy directions," a source in Ukraine's military intelligence told the Kyiv Independent.

Ukrainian forces downed 52 out of the 58 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. "I think we in the United States are behind ...

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's Note: The story was update to include details from a military intelligence source. Perm Krai lies over 1,800 kilometers (1,118 miles) from the Russian-Ukrainian border. At around 9:20 p.m. local time on Sept. 13, Perm Krai Governor Dmitry Makhonin reported that a Ukrainian drone had hit an industrial enterprise in the city of Gubakha. He did not disclose details about the enterprise. "According to preliminary information, equipment for urea production has been damaged," the source claimed. Although urea is primarily used in agriculture, it can also serve as a component in the production of explosives. Russian opposition news channel Astra identified the target as the Metafrax Chemicals plant, a major complex located in Gubakha. Ukraine regularly launches long-range drone attacks on industrial and military targets in Russian territory. Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) carried out a drone strike on Sept. 12 on a major oil refinery in Russia's Bashkortostan Republic, 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) from the border, according to intelligence sources.

TOKYO, Sept 14 (Reuters) – Kenya's Peres Jepchirchir edged Ethiopia's Tigst Assefa in a thrilling sprint finish at Tokyo's National Stadium to win the women's marathon at the world championships on Sunday, adding the world title to the Olympic crown she won in Sapporo in 2021. The 31-year-old broke the tape at two hours, 24 minutes and 43 seconds, just two seconds ahead of Paris silver medallist Assefa. In the wide-open battle for bronze, a surprised Julia Paternain triumphed to give Uruguay its first-ever medal at the worlds, clocking 2:27.23 in her first world championships. For more than two-thirds of the race, Jepchirchir and Assefa were content to hang back as American Susanna Sullivan charged ahead solo looking dominant and in control. Still, Jepchirchir managed to match her rival stride for stride for the remainder of the race, finding one last kick as the pair ran around the National Stadium track to surge ahead and claim her first world title. “It was so hot, so difficult… When I entered the stadium, I got a lot of energy from the fans. “I really did not expect to win.
