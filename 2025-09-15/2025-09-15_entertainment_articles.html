                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For a second year in a row, it came down to the final Emmy category of the night, and in both cases, HBO Max walked away with a surprising big win. Last year it was Outstanding Comedy series for Hacks, and this year it was Outstanding Drama Series for The Pitt, which went head-to-head with the most nominated program of 2025, Apple TV+'s Severance. “It was obviously a huge night for The Pitt,” Casey Bloys, Chairman and CEO, HBO and HBO Max Content, told Deadline at the streamer's post-Emmy party Sunday night at San Vicente Bungalows. He confirmed that there are “a couple shows that we are developing” under the same model as The Pitt, with announcements expected soon. One of the most unexpected Emmy winners Sunday was Somebody Somewhere‘s Jeff Hiller for his role on the underrated HBO comedy. And Hannah Einbinder earned her first Emmy after four seasons of Hacks alongside lead Jean Start who nabbed her fourth. “I was very pleasantly surprised to see Jeff recognized and the show. It is a beautiful show about friendship, and I was just so thrilled for it to be recognized tonight,” Bloys said. (Farrell's co-lead, Cristin Milioti, did win her category.) RELATED: Emmys Snubs & Surprises: ‘The Pitt', Britt Lower, Jeff Hiller Win, ‘White Lotus' Shut Out But that's awards shows, it's unpredictable,” Bloys said. “I do think that The White Lotus may have been a victim of his own success with so many nominations in the categories. Deadline's impromptu interview with Bloys was crashed by Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, who jumped in to praise the veteran HBO executive. HBO has never been this strong,” he said. Since Bloys took over HBO in 2016, the network has managed to win at least one of the top scripted categories, Drama, Comedy and Limited Series, every year except 2021, which was impacted by the pandemic. So can we please, after 21 years, put that to rest?,” Bloys asked. I'm really proud of what everybody has done tonight.” In addition to the Drama Series Emmy award for The Pitt and another Scripted Variety Series Emmy for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, HBO this year also won Best Documentary or Nonfiction Series for 100 Foot Wave and Documentary or Nonfiction Special for Pee-wee As Himself. “That's the thing that HBO has consistently done, it's usually not one show that wins everything,” Bloys said, taking a subtle dig at Apple TV+ and Netflix, which swept the comedy and limited series Sunday night with The Studio and Adolescence, respectively, as their main Emmy tally drivers. Deadline reported earlier this month that The White Lotus will be going to France for its upcoming fourth season. “France for sure but details and location TBD,” Bloys said. “I believe that is the case,” Casey said. Deadline reported last month that Oscar winner Nicolas Cage is in talks to headline the upcoming fifth season of HBO‘s Emmy-winning crime anthology series True Detective, playing a detective in the new installment, which will be set in New York, in Jamaica Bay. House of the Dragon is looking at an early summer 2026 return, possibly in June. “I think it'll be just outside of [the 2026 Emmy eligibility window],” Bloys said. Fellow Game of Thrones prequel A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, originally slated to debut in 2025, will premiere in January. Also targeted for a January 2026 launch is Season 4 of Industry. “I would love to see that show and those performers break through,” Bloys said of the financial drama, which is yet to get major awards recognition in the U.S. The most recent third season of Industry won a Best Leading Actress BAFTA TV Award for star Marisa Abela. Euphoria‘s third season is targeting a spring release and will fit into the 2026 Emmy eligibility window. As for Harry Potter, the high-profile fantasy series will not arrive until 2027. There was some confusion Sunday over the upcoming fifth season of Hacks. Einbinder said on the red carpet that Season 5 will be the Emmy-winning comedy's last, but then she tempered those comments after winning her Emmy by saying the decision was ultimately lies with series creators Jen Statsky, Lucia Aniello and Paul W. Downs. “As usual, we leave that up to the creators, so they will tell us,” Bloys said about the endgame decision on Hacks. As for Euphoria, whose long-delayed third season has been rumored to be its final chapter, Bloys said, “We always leave it up to producers, you never know.” That said, he was realistic about the odds of continuing a show that stars Zendaya, Sydney Sweeney and Jacob Elordi, with Colman Domingo also part of the cast. “I've never had a show with that many legitimate movie stars,” Bloys said. “So as you can imagine, the scheduling is hard enough with actors having multiple jobs, but these are probably three or four of the biggest movie stars working of their generation, so we'll see. But I'm excited to have the third season coming. Nathan Fielder's unique docu-comedy The Rehearsal hit its stride in Season 2 with four Emmy nominations, including for writing and directing. For reference, the gap between Seasons 1 and 2 was almost three years. Three and a half months into the 2026 Emmy eligibility window, HBO Max has already launched two potential contenders: Season 3 of The Gilded Age and limited series Task from Mare of Easttown creator Brad Ingelsby and headlined by Mark Ruffalo. “And we'll have The Gilded Age, hopefully Task breaks through, because I think the performances are phenomenal, and Hacks will be coming back. We've got a new Bill Lawrence and Steve Carell show. We've got a really great limited series called DTF with Jason Bateman and David Harbour by Steve Conrad, Euphoria is coming back.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The rapper has pleaded not guilty to felony charges stemming from a strange naked walk in Los Angeles. Lil Nas X has entered an inpatient treatment program after being arrested and hit with felony charges for allegedly attacking police officers and resisting arrest while wandering naked in Los Angeles. Lawyers for Lil Nas (Montero Hill) appeared in Los Angeles court on Monday (Sept. 15), but the 26-year-old musician was notably absent. Judge Shellie Samuels stated that Lil Nas is “in treatment” outside of California. “We're not going to get specific about where he is,” said the judge. After the hearing, defense attorney Drew Findling spoke to press outside the courthouse and said they do not yet know when Lil Nas will be released from treatment. Findling did not specify the nature of his treatment program. “He is surrounded by an amazing family, an amazing team of people that care about him and love him, and we're just addressing those issues. This is a bump that he's gonna get over.” The rapper was captured on video wandering the streets wearing only underwear and cowboy boots, and he allegedly charged at police officers who were attempting to take him into custody. After a brief hospitalization, Lil Nas was booked in jail. He spent the weekend in custody before being charged with three felony counts of battery with injury to a police officer and a fourth felony count of resisting arrest. Lil Nas pled not guilty to the charges and was granted bail on Aug. 25. Lil Nas' father told news outlets that his son was experiencing mental instability during the incident. Police officers initially hospitalized the rapper for a possible drug overdose, but his attorneys have since stated that they do not yet know whether drugs were involved.

Multiple records were broken, there were many history-making wins, plus upsets galore, and yet all anyone is talking about is a bit that wore out its welcome the second the Boys & Girls Club charity pot went from six figures to five. Walking into the lobby of the Peacock Theater on a particularly muggy Sunday afternoon, there was actually a lot of enthusiasm for comedian Nate Bargatze's first stint as host. Not only was he already an Emmy nominee this year for his most recent Netflix comedy special “Your Friend, Nate Bargatze,” but he had also been one of the hosts during the landmark 50th season of “Saturday Night Live.” His opening sketch, a play on “SNL” highlight “Washington's Dream,” co-starring cast members Bowen Yang, James Austin Johnson, and Mikey Day, worked super-well in the room, with jokes like “What is streaming, sir?” “A new way for people to lose money,” eliciting laughs from the audience full of Television Academy members who work in the industry. Maybe chalk that up to beginner's luck, or playing the hits, but forgoing a traditional monologue to announce an ongoing bit about taking money away from charity in the name of shorter speeches was dead on arrival. And following it shortly with actress Jennifer Coolidge taking triple the amount of time anyone took to give a speech just to present the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series to “Hacks” star Jean Smart didn't help. Immediately, it was clear that Bargatze and Emmys producers Jesse Collins, Dionne Harmon, and Jeannae Rouzan-Clay did not realize the extent to which they were prioritizing a bunch of presenter bits that did not work (as often is the case) over the main thing fans of awards shows generally tune in for: heartfelt acceptance speeches. Thankfully, the charity pot countdown did not seem to get in the way of speeches from actors who gave breakthrough performances this season, like “The Pitt” star Katherine LaNasa and “Severance” star Tramell Tillman, the latter of whom became the first ever Black winner for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. But even when there weren't those imposing numbers on the board, Bargatze's only commentary on those emotional TV moments was always just some play on how the winner damaged the charity pot. It was emblematic of a problem with awards shows in general, one that Bargatze and company are just another example of: These are live events, and live events feed off of the energy in the crowds. The past two Golden Globes also suffered from this, as part of the reason comedian Jo Koy tanked was that no one in the Beverly Hilton ballroom could actually hear him. (For instance, virtually everyone was happy to see “Somebody Somewhere” star Jeff Hiller unexpectedly triumph in the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series over big stars like Harrison Ford and Colman Domingo and perennial nominees like Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Bowen Yang.)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spoiler Space offers thoughts on, and a place to discuss, the plot points we can't disclose in our official review. Fair warning: This article features plot details of The Long Walk. They thrum with an angry, youthful nihilism so potent and potentially seductive that King let Rage fall out of print after it was associated with a number of high school gunmen. Even after countless young men died on the road to glory and the lone survivor has lost his marbles, there remained something like relief beckoning the exhausted Long Walk‘s winner. But the feel-bad ending of director Francis Lawrence and writer JT Mollner's adaptation lacks even that small consolation—and it hides its even sadder finale under the guise of satisfaction. His quest is not one of financial greed or mere survival. He wants to use the wish he gets for winning to snag a carbine and shoot The Major (Mark Hamill) in the head, just like so many of his peers on this walk (and his dissident father) were executed. It's a childish eye-for-an-eye fantasy, one that his level-headed—almost saintly—pal Pete McVries (David Jonsson) questions from the get-go. These questions haunt Mollner's new ending, which makes good on The Long Walk‘s film-long investment in Pete as an enlightened guy worth corrupting. Pete, tired of walking and tired of being saved by Ray—something the film reverses, having Pete always saving Ray—chooses to simply sit down and die. As Ray mourns his friend, he spies a shadow on the road in front of him; when he turns to tell Stebbins, Stebbins keels over, leaving Ray the winner. King never makes Ray's desires explicit in the book, and his ending capitalizes on that ambiguity: Ray never even seems to grasp that he's won, simply pursuing the dark force ahead. Either he's lost his mind and can only see life through the lens of this contest, haunted by visions of infinite competitors one step ahead of him, or he's so close to dying that he can literally see the Reaper who's come to take him away. It's a narrative move that emphasizes the all-encompassing nature of the death march—a literalized nihilism, a specter of military PTSD or endless economic competition keeping him on the dystopian hamster wheel. Ray, in the story's final moments, even begins to run towards his fate. The Long Walk spends its runtime not just establishing a straightforward genre premise or building the bromance between two young men caught in its meat grinder, but establishing Pete's moral fiber and idealism, born of past mistakes. And, knowing how pessimistic The Long Walk is, a character this pure must only exist to fall back down to grubby earth. He sacrifices himself for his friend, knowing that Pete has the big heart and silver-lining perspective needed to actually do some good with the power bestowed upon the Walk's winner. Or at least, he did before The Long Walk broke him. Lawrence refuses to show any of the aftermath of The Major's death, any chaos from spectators or soldiers, because he doesn't need to. By following through on this juvenile daydream, this delusion that killing one man can stop interlocking systems of oppression, Pete has compromised himself.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Grammy-winning artist Lil Nas X, born Montero Hill, is “in treatment” at an undisclosed facility in another state following his arrest and arraignment on felony charges last month, his lawyers confirmed at a court hearing Monday. “Defendant is allowed to remain out of state as long as he remains in treatment,” Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Shellie Samuels said as she modified the conditions of Hill's release to allow for the ongoing inpatient care. We're doing what is best for Montero from a personal standpoint and a professional standpoint, but most importantly, for his well-being,” Hill's lawyer, Drew Findling, said after the hearing. This is a bump that he's going to get over.” In August, Hill was charged with three felony counts of battery with injury on a police officer and one felony count of resisting an executive officer. Prosecutors claim Hill was “strolling naked” along Ventura Boulevard around 5:40 a.m. on Aug. 21 when police arrived at the scene. They allege Hill assaulted the responding officers trying to take him into custody, injuring at least three of them. If convicted as charged, Hill faces up to five years in state prison. Hill pleaded not guilty at an arraignment Aug. 25 and was released on a $75,000 bond after spending the weekend in jail. “Your girl is gonna be OK, y'all,” Hill said in an Instagram Story post. Shit.” Letting out a weary laugh, he said, “That was fucking terrifying.

Before the arrest, Hill shared some unreleased music and mirror selfies in Instagram posts that sparked concern. He spent several hours there before being taken to jail.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Massive Attack will perform at the São Paulo arena Espaco Unimed, on a bill with the Sepultura side project Cavalera, on Thursday, November 13. The bands partnered with the Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon to put on the show, in support of their fight to achieve climate justice and secure immediate recognition and protection for Indigenous lands. Representatives of Indigenous movements will appear at the event itself, a press release notes, and the two bands will also work within Brazil to support Amazonian Indigenous movements. Sepultura founders Max and Iggor Cavalera will perform the band's Chaos AD album in full at the show. Robert “3D” Del Naja added that he is honored to work with the brothers “in support of the extraordinary integrity and vital role of the Indigenous people of Brazil and the wider Amazon region. This is more than a passing of the mic. It's an opportunity to listen to the knowledge, moral authority and wisdom of the Indigenous alliances and help ensure they are heard in the negotiation rooms of COP30. We've never needed their presence within that distorted political space as much as we do right now.” It reads: “We, Indigenous peoples, step onto the stage as if lighting an ancient fire in the heart of the night. Together with Massive Attack and Cavalera, we turn sound into uprising. We are here to remind you: The Earth remembers. And through us, it demands—dismantle the machine that devours her.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump will be traveling London this week for a state visit with King Charles III and Prime Minister Keir Starmer. And if President Trump cares to watch along after the state banquet, he may even clear up a few misconceptions.” This is not Trump's first visit with the British monarchy. While the queen reportedly found Trump to be “very rude,” the visit provided Trump with a level of public legitimacy on the international stage — which he hopes to burnish this week despite ever increasing turmoil at home. Trump is also expected to lay a wreath at the tomb of Elizabeth II, and attend a state banquet in the evening. Stephen Colbert and ‘Late Show' Win Emmy After Cancellation: ‘Stay Strong, Be Brave' Then He Smuggled $500 Million Worth of Cocaine in One Night On Thursday, the president is scheduled to meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer for a bilateral summit. The pair are expected to sign off on a series of economic and tech deals during the visit, including plans to develop a dozen nuclear power plants and nuclear powered data centers. The visit comes just weeks after Trump met with Starmer in Scotland at one of his golf clubs. Trump inaugurated a new golf club on the same, taxpayer-funded trip.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Definitive Decoration Day includes a remixed and remastered version of the original album and a bunch of songs recorded live at Flicker Bar, in Athens, Georgia, in 2002. The Definitive Decoration Day is being released digitally and in a 4xLP box set. The physical collection includes a 40-page, full-color book with photographs, artwork, and a new essay by longtime Pitchfork contributor Stephen M. Deusner. In a press release, Patterson Hood discussed the band's Flicker Bar show that's now captured on The Definitive Decoration Day. “We decided that it would be fun to go play an acoustic late-night show at the tiny Flicker Bar, less than a block away from our beloved 40 Watt Club,” he said. I didn't even know until recently that there was an existing tape of the show. Decoration Day was the follow-up to Drive-By Truckers' acclaimed third album, Southern Rock Opera, and it was the band's first with Jason Isbell. I can hear the Truckers in all that music.” Then, last year, they shared a new deluxe edition of Southern Rock Opera. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

But we live in a country that accepts white children being massacred by gun violence. “Part of what keeps America so violent is the insistence that people perform care, empty goodness and absolution for white men who espouse hatred and violence…Again. I don't care for empty rhetoric.” She also posted one of Kirk's quotes, that “Black women do not have the brain processing power to be taken seriously. You have to go steal a white person's slot.” Social media has been rife with claims of what Kirk has said in the past, but Snopes rated the Black women quote, from a podcast in 2023, as true. A spokesperson for The Washington Post declined to comment on personnel matters. “Refusing to tear my clothes and smear ashes on my face in performative mourning for a white man that espoused violence…is not the same as violence,” she wrote. Her Substack post included a photo of her with Post owner Jeff Bezos, taken at the 2019 Gridiron dinner. She also noted in Substack that she was the last remaining Black full-time opinion columnist at the Post, which has seen an exodus amid some of Bezos' new editorial mandates and a buyout offer earlier this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last week, news broke that Ireland and the Netherlands were threatening to withdraw from next year's song contest, held in Vienna, Austria in May, if Israel is permitted to take part. On Friday, Dutch public broadcaster Avrotros concurred, adding: “Human suffering, the suppression of press freedom and political interference are at odds with the values of public broadcasting.” Similar sentiments have come from Slovenia's RTVSLO and Iceland's RÚV, and calls have been made in neighboring countries — including from musician Phil Coulter in the U.K. — to follow suit. Channel 4 to Mark Trump's U.K. Visit With "Longest Uninterrupted Reel of Untruths Ever Broadcast on Television" “The EBU has not made any proposals to [Israeli broadcaster] Kan regarding participation in next year's Eurovision Song Contest,” a spokesperson told THR. It comes after the 2025 edition of Europe's most popular singing competition proved similarly divisive as widespread protests and boycotts surrounding Israel's participation took place. Israeli entrant Yuval Raphael finished in second place, though her performance was interrupted by protestors attempting to claim the stage. It isn't the first time the contest has had to brace itself for geopolitical fallout — Russia has been excluded since 2022 after invading Ukraine — but the unrest among members is proving to be catastrophic for organizers who have yet to find a way through that keeps each country happy. The world's largest live music contest has been a springboard to fame for some of the biggest acts in history, including legendary Swedish band ABBA or Italian glam rock band Måneskin.

As many had predicted, the 77th Primetime Emmys were dominated on the comedy side by “The Studio.” Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's film industry satire has been the talk of Hollywood since it premiered, so few were shocked to see it win 13 Emmys across the Primetime and Creative Arts ceremonies, including Best Comedy Series and Leading Actor in a Comedy Series for Rogen. The Apple TV+ show ended up breaking the record for most Emmy wins for a comedy series in one year — and that's on top of the record that it already set with its 23 nominations. But there was one “The Studio“-related Emmy prediction that didn't come true: Sal Saperstein was never mentioned during the show. Once a “Studio” sweep began to feel inevitable on Emmy night, many expected Rogen and his pals to continue the trend. And the comedian gave a straightforward answer that definitely put the bit to bed (at least, until next year's Emmys). It feels weird to reference your own joke in my opinion,” Rogen said. “We were hoping Jack Thorne would do it.” Given the show's knack for recreating real award shows, Rogen was also asked if his night at the Emmy's had given him any ideas for a future episode. “This was far too good a thing to happen on our show, unfortunately,” he said. “Our show is generally based on stress and disappointment, but right now we're all happy.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

There have been a few people to go over and a few to go under, but it took less than an hour for someone to outright say “I don't care” and go well past the time limit. “Finally, I just wanna say, go birds, fuck ICE, and free Palestine. Returning after the commercial break, Bargatze also threatened to start a swear jar while commenting on Einbinder saying “fuck ICE.” Einbinder's statement came after both her Hacks co-star and Monsters star Javier Bardem spoke out in support of Palestine on the red carpet.
