                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the days since Charlie Kirk's death, some companies have been forced to navigate a delicate situation: employees sharing their personal views about the conservative activist in public. For employers, those remarks highlight the growing challenge of balancing free expression with corporate values and workplace harmony. Major corporations such as Microsoft and Delta Air Lines are taking action against employees who have made social media posts critical of Kirk's own views, or even ones celebrating his death, which could be considered a violation of company values. Kirk, an ally of President Donald Trump, advocated conservative beliefs on college campuses and was influential among young people on the right. Microsoft shared an X post on Friday addressing negative remarks about Kirk made online by some of its employees. Microsoft said, "Comments celebrating violence against anyone are unacceptable and do not align with our values." Microsoft's statement came after Tesla CEO Elon Musk called out Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on X in response to an unverified claim that some employees at Blizzard, a video game company owned by Microsoft, had posted comments "trashing" Kirk. The ODP Corporation, the parent company of Office Depot, apologized to consumers on Friday after footage taken at a Michigan Office Depot gained attention on social media. "The behavior displayed by our associate is completely unacceptable and insensitive, violates our company policies, and does not reflect the values we uphold at Office Depot. "We continue to aggressively investigate the matter and will take action where appropriate." On Friday, Nasdaq said it fired an employee for their remarks about Kirk because they violated company policy. Nasdaq has a zero-tolerance policy toward violence and any commentary that condones or celebrates violence," the company said on X. "The employee in question has been terminated, effective immediately." The political analyst Matthew Dowd was widely attacked online after making remarks about Kirk during an appearance on MSNBC's "Katy Tur Reports" on Wednesday. MSNBC's president, Rebecca Kutler, called Dowd's comments "insensitive" in an X post later that day. "During our breaking news coverage of the shooting of Charlie Kirk, Matthew Dowd made comments that were inappropriate, insensitive, and unacceptable," the statement said. There is no place for violence in America, political or otherwise." Dowd responded in a subsequent Substack article on Friday, confirming that MSNBC had fired him. "The Right Wing media mob ginned up, went after me on a plethora of platforms, and MSNBC reacted to that mob," he wrote. "Even though most at MSNBC knew my words were being misconstrued, the timing of my words forgotten (remember I said this before anyone knew Kirk was a target), and that I apologized for any miscommunication on my part, I was terminated by the end of the day." Comcast and Versant executives urged employees to "treat people with kindness" in a memo on Friday. Versant is an independent media company being spun off from Comcast and NBCUniversal that will eventually own MSNBC. "Regardless of whether you agreed with his political views, his words and actions underscore the urgency to maintain a respectful exchange of ideas — a principle we must champion," the memo said. The memo added: "As employees, we ask you to embody our values in your work and communities. The firm fired a lawyer whose social media posts about Kirk gained attention online, where commentators noted his place of work, according to The Wall Street Journal. On Thursday, the Carolina Panthers addressed comments from one of its employees, writing on X, "The views expressed by our employees are their own and do not represent those of the Carolina Panthers." Delta Air Lines suspended an unknown number of employees over their social media posts about Kirk, a companywide memo viewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution showed. He added, "Violations of our social media policy can carry meaningful consequences, including termination." Karen Attiah said she was fired as an opinion writer from The Washington Post after posting on social media about Charlie Kirk. Attiah wrote a Substack post published Monday that said she was fired after "speaking out against political violence, racial double standards, and America's apathy toward guns." A Washington Post spokesperson said the paper doesn't comment on personnel matters. The day Kirk was shot, Attiah said in a Bluesky post that there was a double standard in how the shooting deaths of Democrats were treated and a failure to address "white men" who commit violence. Attiah wrote a post mentioning Kirk that said the left was prematurely being blamed for his death. Another of her posts referred to not doing performative mourning for "a white man that espoused violence." It is not clear what particular social-media posts led to Attiah's firing. Attiah's departure comes in the wake of the Jeff Bezos-owned Post's overhaul of its opinion section, which is now focused on "personal liberties and free markets." Business Insider contacted all the companies mentioned in this story for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor involved in criminal cases against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, sued the Department of Justice on Monday to get her job back after she was fired from the Trump administration in July. Comey, a daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, received no explanation for her "unlawful and unconstitutional" termination, her attorneys wrote in the lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan. "In truth, there is no legitimate explanation," they wrote. "Rather, Defendants fired Ms. Comey solely or substantially because her father is former FBI Director James B. Comey, or because of her perceived political affiliation and beliefs, or both." The Justice Department and Comey's lawyers did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment on the suit. Comey is the latest among dozens of DOJ employees who have turned to the courts after being terminated during Trump's second term. Comey, like a number of other ousted government officials, had been targeted by Laura Loomer, a far-right activist who has taken credit for influencing the Trump administration to fire people. After Comey was fired in mid-July, Loomer boasted that the move followed "my pressure campaign on [Attorney General Pam Bondi] to fire Comey's daughter and Comey's son in law from the DOJ." Comey's husband, Lucas Isaacharoff, "voluntarily resigned" from the DOJ in May, according to the lawsuit. Following her ouster, Comey warned that she was being made an example of in order to quell potential dissent within the DOJ. "If a career prosecutor can be fired without reason, fear may seep into the decisions of those who remain," Comey wrote in a farewell note to staff at the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office. "Fear is the tool of a tyrant, wielded to suppress independent thought. Instead of fear, let this moment fuel the fire that already burns in the heart of this place," she wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Until he became the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and a warrior in President Trump's fight with the Federal Reserve, Bill Pulte was mostly known for posting on X. Over the last six months, he has posted at least 13 official orders on his personal account — and they don't appear to be posted publicly anywhere else. Under previous leaders, the FHFA hasn't followed a single standard for publishing orders. Former FHFA employees said they couldn't recall learning about orders on Twitter or social media before. Former FHFA officials and a legal expert said publishing directives — including one instructing the companies to consider cryptocurrency assets in mortgage underwriting — on a personal social media account raised concerns about legality and how those inside and outside the industry are supposed to track changes that could affect lenders, investors, and tenants. The orders, including two that roll back climate change and tenant protection requirements, don't appear to have been posted on any government websites. Some of the posts were previously reported by Inman, a housing industry publication. The FHFA is not required to post all of its orders and policy directives online. Pulte said in an interview posted April 30 that he had already signed 80 orders. In the past, the agency has often drafted orders collaboratively and circulated them by email to relevant parties when they were finalized, said Victoria Nahrwold, a former senior official at the FHFA who retired in June. Pulte's most recent post, from June, called on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider the value of a homebuyer's cryptocurrency when calculating their assets. Pulte posted about what he described as an "official government account" back in May. Janell Byrd-Chichester, the FHFA's chief of staff from 2014 to 2019, called Pulte's social-media use "very bizarre" and out of step with past practice. Nahrwold said that while she worked at FHFA, she followed Pulte on X to learn about what was going on at the FHFA and the entities it regulated. At least some orders posted on X were also circulated by email, she said. "This is very abnormal," said David Reiss, a law professor at Cornell University who focuses on housing policy and real-estate finance. "I don't know what a court would do if someone sued based on an order that he only posted on X." He added by email that impacted parties might argue that carrying out official acts by an X post doesn't comply with the Administrative Procedure Act. The FHFA did not respond to questions about Pulte's posts. Pulte didn't respond to a request for comment. Despite the relative obscurity of the FHFA — which was created by Congress in 2008 to be a stronger regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac amid a wave of mortgage defaults — Pulte catapulted to prominence in recent weeks after accusing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud. Pulte said in a Bloomberg TV appearance that he only posted public information. Though he deleted nearly all of his X posts after Trump was elected president in 2024, he eventually resumed posting at a rapid pace. He posted or reposted 33 times on September 5, for example, mostly to assail the president's political opponents, including Cook. The orders that Pulte posted on X are hardly the biggest thing on FHFA's plate; the National Association of Realtors described some of them in a blog post as not creating any "notable cost savings." More important to observers of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and their regulator are the Trump administration's plans to sell part of the US Treasury's massive stake in the mortgage securitization companies.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Congressional Budget Office director Phillip Swagel said Monday that President Donald Trump's tariffs appear to have pushed inflation up higher than CBO analysts had initially expected. His views differ from those of Wall Street analysts, many of whom have been bracing for tariff-driven price hikes, but have yet to see them in materialize. Speaking on CNBC's "Squawk Box," Swagel said the CBO analysis shows the economy has weakened since January, which he would expect to exert downward pressure on inflation. "That would be a big reversal in terms of the deficit." Trump's tariffs face an uncertain future. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in early November, after the Trump administration appealed lower court rulings that found the president had exceeded his authority. But that uncertainty is likely to fade over time, according to the CBO's latest report. "The effects of policy uncertainty dissipate over time and disappear by the end of 2027, returning investment to what it would have been without the uncertainty in trade policy," the September CBO analysis said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Together, they're worth $1.03 trillion, rivaling Berkshire's $1.07 billion market capitalization and comfortably surpassing the $800 billion-plus market values of JPMorgan, Walmart, and Oracle. It's striking that three individuals are worth almost as much on paper as Berkshire, a corporate behemoth that generates around $370 billion in annual revenue, employs nearly 400,000 workers, and has arguably the world's greatest living investor at its helm. Musk, Ellison, and Zuckerberg are worth so much because they're the biggest shareholders of some of the world's most valuable companies. Musk owns about 13% of Tesla and 42% of SpaceX, Ellison holds about a 41% stake in Oracle, and Zuckerberg has around a 13% stake in Meta. Most ultrawealthy people have also grown substantially richer this year. The 17 members of the $100 billion club have added a net $434 billion to their joint fortunes this year, boosting their combined wealth to $3.2 trillion at Friday's close — a figure greater than the market values of Alphabet or Amazon. Musk, Ellison, and Zuckerberg have seen their fortunes balloon in recent years thanks to investor optimism around AI's potential to slash corporations' costs and supercharge their profitability. Oracle's stock price climbed as much as 43% last Wednesday alone, lifting the company's market value by nearly $300 billion at its peak, after it projected rapid revenue growth fueled by AI demand. The proposed deal would grant Musk shares worth over $1 trillion if he manages to increase his company's market value by around eightfold and hit a slew of operational targets within the next decade or so. Musk purchased around $1 billion worth of Tesla stock on Friday, signaling he likes his chances.</p>

Tesla shares jumped 6% in premarket trading this morning after CEO Elon Musk disclosed his first purchase of the electric vehicle maker's stock on the open market in more than five years. Musk's haul of more than 2.5 million shares equates to around $1 billion. There's more breaking news this morning: China's market regulator said in a preliminary probe that Nvidia violated anti-monopoly law when it acquired Mellanox. China's State Administration for Market Regulation on Monday did not specify how Nvidia allegedly broke the country's anti-monopoly laws. Last week, Oracle became the latest public beneficiary of OpenAI's spending spree. Oracle thrilled investors with surging cloud growth projections, fueled in large part by expected spending from OpenAI. Shares of Oracle climbed more than 25% last week, marking its biggest weekly gain since 1999. As CNBC's Mackenzie Sigalos reports, this is part of a larger trend in the tech world. Oracle, Broadcom, Microsoft and Nvidia — four companies with ties to OpenAI — have seen their combined market caps grow by more than $4.5 trillion since the AI company burst onto the scene in 2022. However, some analysts are wary of OpenAI's outsized influence on the sector. That comes as regional chains like Wawa and Casey's General Store invest in their food-service offerings. Breakfast traffic can also buoy sales for these businesses as demand for staples like gasoline and tobacco slides. CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning. Swiss watchmaker Swatch isn't taking President Donald Trump's tariffs sitting down. In a special edition watch it calls the "WHAT IF...TARIFFS?" A spokesperson told CNBC that Swatch will "immediately stop" selling the watch if the U.S. changes its tariff policy. The watch is only available for purchase in Switzerland. It's a vastly different tariff response than the one taken by fellow Swiss watchmaker Rolex. The company's CEO, Jean-Frederic Dufour, appeared alongside Trump in Rolex's midcourt box at the U.S. Open earlier this month. Shares of UnitedHealth Group have surged nearly 30% since Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a stake in the insurer last month.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On the 14th of September, 2025, a Russian delegation led by Russian Deputy PM, Alexey Overchuk, arrived in Egypt to further strengthen the bilateral ties between both countries. DON'T MISS THIS: "The worst has passed," Egypt's Prime Minister assures his people A key focus of his visit was the Russian Industrial Zone, a large-scale industrial development project that Russia and Egypt agreed to establish inside the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZone) at East Port Said. We believe that the Russian industrial zone will become a convenient entry point for our business both to Egypt itself and to the African continent," Alexey Overchuk stated. Representatives of business groups and Russian businesspeople who were interested in working in the Russian industrial zone were part of the delegation led by Alexey Overchuk. “Therefore, at this stage, it is very important that businesses go there, take a look, evaluate their capabilities, and measure them with their own investment plans," the Russian Deputy Prime Minister added. This is a group with extensive experience in creating an industrial zone in Russia and is able to work on attracting residents," Overchuk stated. In June, Russia's plan to open a new consulate in the Egyptian Red Sea resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh was reported, following a decision by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin to go ahead with the plans. In the same month, it was also announced that Russia had achieved a new world grain export record by shipping more than 10 million tons of wheat to Egypt in 2024. “Russia is the largest exporter of wheat to Egypt and delivered more than ten million tons there last year. This is an unprecedented figure because no other country in the world has purchased grain in such volumes, and Russia has not sold this much wheat to any other country,” the Russian Ambassador to Cairo, Georgy Borisenko, stated. In August, Russia officially recognized Egypt as its principal African trade and economic partner. The Russian Foreign Ministry reported that bilateral trade exceeded $9 billion in 2024, underscoring Egypt's crucial role in Moscow's continental engagement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Today, the Romanian Air Force intercepted a Russian drone violating our national airspace," wrote Romania's defense minister, Ionut Mosteanu, in a statement on Sunday. The drone was detected while Romanian forces were monitoring the northern border on Saturday evening, amid a Russian attack on nearby Ukrainian infrastructure, Mosteanu said. "Romania condemns Russia's reckless behavior, which threatens regional stability," Mosteanu's statement said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a statement on Saturday about Romania's reported incursion, said that the Russian drone had "penetrated about 10 kilometers," or six miles, into NATO airspace. Romania has said it has dealt with such incursions before, scrambling fighter jets several times over the years after Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022. But Saturday's incident comes as NATO has been on high alert since Poland said on Wednesday that it had detected at least 19 Russian drones entering its airspace. That act has been widely interpreted in the West as an attempt to probe the alliance's readiness, cohesion, and response to aggression. NATO fighter jets, including Dutch F-35s and Polish F-16s, scrambled to confront the drones, shooting down at least three. The incursions in Poland happened while Russia was conducting one of its large-scale attacks on Ukraine, and the Kremlin has denied deliberately flying drones into Polish airspace. However, it hasn't acknowledged if its drones entered NATO airspace. In response to Romania's incursion report, Russia's ambassador to Romania, Vladimir Lipayev, said Bucharest's complaint was a "provocation by the Kyiv regime." Kaja Kallas, the European Union's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, condemned the reported breach in Romania as "reckless escalation" by Moscow. "The violation of Romanian airspace by Russian drones is yet another unacceptable breach of an EU Member State's sovereignty," she said in a statement on Sunday. In February, Romania passed a law that gave its forces the authority to shoot down or destroy Russian drones illegally entering its airspace.</p>
