                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly half of U.S. adults - 122.4 million people - are living with high blood pressure (BP), a leading preventable risk factor for heart disease, stroke and premature death, according to the 2025 American Heart Association Statistical Update. Yet just a quarter of them have their BP under control, making both diagnosis and effective management critical. The American Heart Association, a relentless force changing the future of health for everyone everywhere, and American Medical Association (AMA) are recognizing 2,307 health care organizations - 495 more than in 2024 - for tackling this public health challenge through the Target: BP™ initiative. Target: BP™ is a national initiative launched in 2015 by the American Heart Association and AMA in response to the high prevalence of uncontrolled blood pressure. More than 40% of participating organizations are nonprofit health centers that receive federal funding from the Health Resources and Services Administration to reach medically underserved populations. Among those organizations recognized for their efforts, nearly 60% received Gold or Gold+ award level recognition for achieving BP control rates of greater than or equal to 70%. Approximately 37% of awardees achieved Silver or Silver+ recognition for adopting evidence-based activities. Hypertension is called the 'silent killer' for a reason - too often it goes unnoticed until serious damage is done, and it accounts for nearly $50 billion in annual health care costs in the U.S.. Since the American Heart Association and AMA launched Target: BP™, more than 4,900 health care organizations have joined the nationwide movement to make heart health a priority. For the past five years, approximately 80% of participating organizations have continued their engagement year after year - reflecting a continuous commitment to improving BP and sharing a common goal to improve health outcomes associated with heart disease, the No. "We know hypertension control is possible when physicians, care teams and patients work together," said AMA President Bobby Mukkamala, M.D. Discover how real-time Raman monitoring enhances API control and quality during hot melt extrusion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conducted at the University of Eastern Finland, a recent study found that older patients are open to using wearable smart rings and view themselves as active contributors to their own care. The possibility for caregivers to access patient data collected was seen as reassuring and motivating, providing a sense of safety and guidance. The study was conducted at Kuopio University Hospital and involved interviews with patients. Patients were asked about their perceptions and expectations of the Oura Ring, a Finnish-designed smart ring originally created for wellness tracking but also being considered for health monitoring purposes. The study stresses the need to involve patients early in the design and implementation of digital health solutions to ensure that technologies are acceptable, user-friendly and supportive of long-term engagement. Listening to patients at the pre-implementation stage provides crucial insights for adopting effective and meaningful remote monitoring solutions. For healthcare professionals, this means being prepared to integrate user-friendly tools into older adults' care where appropriate, while also addressing concerns about devices, data protection and the benefits of continuous monitoring."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A pioneering international project led by prominent female scientists, involving research staff from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M) and promoted by the Spanish Space Agency (AEE), has just completed its parabolic flight campaign in Bordeaux (France). Its main objective is to study and counteract the adverse effects of microgravity on the human body, a key challenge for future exploration of the Moon and Mars. The research is led by Professor Ana Díaz Artiles, from Texas A&M University (TAMU, USA) and honorary professor in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at UC3M. Her team tested an innovative countermeasure to protect the cardiovascular and ocular health of astronauts on long-duration missions. The results of this research will not only be crucial for the future of human space exploration, but could also have important applications on Earth, such as in the treatment of vascular diseases and cardiovascular rehabilitation." Ana Díaz Artiles, Professor, Texas A&M University, USA This project marks a milestone due to its approach and its team members, which include a notable number of women and Spanish participants. During space missions, the absence of gravity gradients causes a redistribution of body fluids towards the head, which can cause vision problems, increased intracranial pressure, and increased risk of blood clots in the neck. "The most interesting thing about this project is that we are evaluating such a promising countermeasure as LBNP in real microgravity conditions. The project is funded by ESA, NASA, TAMU, and Lockheed Martin Corporation, underscoring its international importance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers have successfully used artificial intelligence (AI) to predict which patients need treatment to stabilize their corneas and preserve their eyesight, in a study presented today (Sunday) at the 43rd Congress of the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ESCRS). The research focused on people with keratoconus, a visual impairment that generally develops in teenagers and young adults and tends to worsen into adulthood. In some cases, the condition can be managed with contact lenses, but in others it deteriorates quickly and if it is not treated, patients may need a corneal transplant. The researchers used AI to assess images of patients' eyes, combined with other data, and to successfully predict which patients needed prompt treatment and which could continue with monitoring. When performed before permanent scarring develops, cross-linking often prevents the need for corneal transplantation. This means patients need frequent monitoring over many years, with cross-linking typically performed after progression has already occurred." The study involved a group of patients who were referred to Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust for keratoconus assessment and monitoring, including scanning the front of the eye with optical coherence tomography (OCT) to examine its shape. Researchers used AI to study 36,673 OCT images of 6,684 different patients along with other patient data. The AI algorithm could accurately predict whether a patient's condition would deteriorate or remain stable using images and data from the first visit alone. Using AI, the researchers could sort two-thirds of patients into a low-risk group, who did not need treatment, and the other third into a high-risk group, who needed prompt cross-linking treatment. When information from a second hospital visit was included, the algorithm could successfully categorise up to 90% of patients. Cross linking treatment uses ultraviolet light and vitamin B2 (riboflavin) drops to stiffen the cornea, and it is successful in more than 95% of cases. Although this study is limited to using one specific OCT device, the research methods and AI algorithm used can be applied to other devices. Our results could mean that patients with high-risk keratoconus will be able to receive preventative treatment before their condition progresses. Low-risk patients will avoid unnecessary frequent monitoring, freeing up healthcare resources. The researchers are now developing a more powerful AI algorithm, trained on millions of eye scans, that can be tailored for specific tasks, including predicting keratoconus progression, but also other tasks such as detecting eye infections and inherited eye diseases. Dr. José Luis Güell, ESCRS Trustee and Head of the Cornea, Cataract and Refractive Surgery Department at the Instituto de Microcirugía Ocular, Barcelona, Spain, who was not involved in the research, said: "Keratoconus is a manageable condition, but knowing who to treat, and when and how to give treatment is challenging. Unfortunately, this problem can lead to delays, with many patients experiencing vision loss and requiring invasive implant or transplant surgery. "This research suggests that we can use AI to help predict who will progress, even from their first routine consultation, meaning we could treat patients early before progression and secondary changes. Equally, we could reduce unnecessary monitoring of patients whose condition is stable. If it consistently demonstrates its effectiveness, this technology would ultimately prevent vision loss and more difficult management strategies in young, working-age patients."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Danish national registry trial shows the RSVpreF vaccine is highly effective at preventing severe RSV illness and related hospitalizations in older adults, offering real-world support for broader immunization strategies. Study: RSV Prefusion F Vaccine for Prevention of Hospitalization in Older Adults. In a recent study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, researchers investigated the efficacy of the novel bivalent RSV prefusion F protein-based vaccine (RSVpreF) in preventing severe symptomatic Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infections, particularly in older adults (60 years and older). The study leveraged an extensive (131,000 participants), open-label, pragmatic randomized trial conducted in Denmark during the 2024–2025 winter season. Participants aged 60 and above were primarily recruited via digital invitations through the national registry infrastructure. The trial was designed to reflect real-world conditions, utilizing broad eligibility criteria and integrating administrative health registries for recruitment, randomization (1:1 – vaccine vs. no trial-administered vaccine), and outcome tracking. Findings revealed that the vaccine was 83.3% effective at preventing rigorously defined RSV-related hospitalizations (based on ICD-10 codes or positive tests within 7 days of admission) and 91.7% effective against RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease hospitalizations, confirming its role in protecting older populations within a real-world trial framework. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that, while common across age groups, can cause severe respiratory illness in infants and older adults, often leading to hospitalization of the latter. Despite this burden, routine RSV testing remains limited, potentially underestimating true incidence. Titled A Pragmatic Randomized Trial to Evaluate Bivalent RSV Prefusion F Protein–based Vaccine Effectiveness for Preventing RSV Hospitalizations in Adults Aged 60 Years or Above (DAN-RSV), the trial randomly assigned 131,276 adults in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the RSVpreF vaccine or no trial-administered vaccine (control group). Notably, 1.2% of controls sought RSV vaccination outside the trial. The study's primary endpoint was hospitalization for RSV-related respiratory tract disease, defined using national registry data through ICD-10 codes or a positive RSV test within 7 days before or after admission. Key secondary endpoints included hospitalization for RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease and hospitalization for respiratory tract disease from any cause, tested hierarchically after the primary endpoint. Fewer events occurred than expected, partly due to reduced RSV testing in Denmark following the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings translate to a vaccine effectiveness of 83.3% (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 42.9–96.9), exceeding the prespecified success criterion of 20% (p = 0.007). The vaccine also showed benefit against broader outcomes: 91.7% efficacy against RSV-related lower respiratory tract hospitalization (1 vs. 12 events; 95% CI, 43.7–99.8; p=0.009); a 15.2% reduction in any respiratory tract disease hospitalization (284 vs. 335; 95% CI, 0.5–27.9; p=0.04), though this secondary endpoint was not adjusted for multiplicity after hierarchical testing; and a 9.9% reduction in cardiorespiratory hospitalizations (exploratory). The greater absolute reduction in hospitalizations for respiratory disease from any cause (compared to confirmed RSV cases) suggests that the vaccine prevented many hospitalizations where RSV infection went undiagnosed due to limited testing. The incidence of serious adverse events was similar between the two groups within 6 weeks of vaccination. Five vaccine-related SAEs occurred (including pericarditis and Bell's palsy), and a non-significant mortality imbalance emerged by season's end (146 vs. 120 deaths). The study provides robust evidence from a pragmatic trial that RSVpreF significantly reduces RSV-related hospitalizations in adults aged 60 and older. By leveraging a large-scale, open-label design and national registries, the study addresses limitations of earlier trials. While potential healthy-volunteer bias and undertesting of RSV remain caveats, the vaccine demonstrated protection against severe outcomes with a manageable safety profile.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New genetic evidence suggests that targeting GIPR and GLP1R could reduce harmful drinking patterns while improving liver and metabolic health, opening the door to repurposing existing metabolic drugs for alcohol use disorders. A recent study published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry investigated whether genetically proxied agonism of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) influences alcohol use disorder (AUD) and problematic alcohol use (PAU) behaviors. Growing evidence suggests that these therapies may also address AUD and substance use disorders (SUDs). GLP1R agonists have been promising in decreasing drug and alcohol intake. Preclinical evidence indicates GIPR agonism influences weight regulation and glucose metabolism. GIPR and GLP1R were instrumented using body mass index (BMI) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) data, as these traits capture the core effects of their agonists. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within 500 kilobases of the GLP1R locus and associated with HbA1c levels in European ancestry participants of the United Kingdom Biobank (UKB) were used to investigate GLP1R agonism. GLP1R and GIPR instruments were separately developed using BMI genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. BMI and HbA1c instruments for GIPR and GLP1R were aggregated into single instruments capturing both loci to model the effects of GIPR/GLP1R agonists. To validate instruments, their associations with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) were examined for each exposure. Further, the proportion of individuals carrying at least one activation allele at GLP1R and GIPR loci was estimated in European, African, and East Asian populations. Findings were replicated in independent datasets, supported by colocalization analyses, and tested with multiple sensitivity instruments to strengthen causal inference. The primary analysis focused on PAU; in addition, distinct alcohol intake behaviors were examined. Drinks-per-week results were largely null in European ancestry participants, suggesting effects may concentrate on binge/heavy patterns. Moreover, alcohol misuse classes identified through latent class analysis of over 410,000 UKB participants were incorporated to explore in-depth how GIPR and GLP1R activity may differentially affect drinking behaviors. Relationships with other SUDs, including cannabis (CUD), opioid (OUD), and tobacco (TUD) use disorders, and food liking behaviors were also investigated. Further, six liver-related outcomes were analyzed; these were alcohol-related liver disease (ALD), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and liver enzymes: alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase. This study used summary-level GWAS data relating to glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and body mass index (BMI) to construct genetic instruments modeling GLP1R and GIPR agonism. Each instrument type included multiple exposure sources mimicking the expected physiological responses to pharmacological modulation of the targets (lowered glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], reduced body mass index [BMI], and GLP1R or GIPR gene expression in the cortex). Instrument sets for each BMI and HbA1c exposure were constructed in two independent GWAS summary statistics (UK Biobank [plus GIANT for BMI] and the Million Veterans Program [MVP]). We contextualized the alcohol-related analyses by analyzing other substance use disorders and investigating outcomes related to self-reported food liking. Because of the availability of large sample sizes and the most relevant endpoints, we used data from European ancestry as the main analysis set, but we also performed analyses using East Asian and African ancestry data sources. Finally, for all drug-target MR estimates demonstrating evidence of a relationship (main drug-target MR method P < 0.05), we performed colocalization analyses to assess evidence of shared causal variants between the biomarker exposures and outcomes in the GLP1R and GIPR genomic loci. MR Mendelian Randomization, GLP1R Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor, GIPR glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor, NAFLD Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, ALD Alcohol-related liver disease, SNP Single nucleotide polymorphism, BMI Body mass index. For GLP1R agonism, genetically proxied reductions in BMI via GLP1R showed consistent associations with a decreased risk of obesity; lower HbA1c levels were also associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). For GIPR/GLP1R agonism, lower BMI through both receptor activation substantially reduces the risk of obesity. Receptor-activating alleles at both GLP1R and GIPR loci showed high prevalence across populations. Further, there was evidence for lower binge drinking linked to BMI lowering through GIPR/GLP1R. Further, genetically lowered HbA1c via GIPR/GLP1R was associated with 38% reduced odds of broad heavy drinking with psychiatric comorbidities compared to light drinking behavior. When analyzed separately, both GLP1R and GIPR also showed protective associations with heavy-risk drinking classes. CUD, OUD, and TUD analyses provided consistent null results. However, genetically lowered BMI via GIPR/GLP1R showed robust associations with food preferences, especially vegetarian and fatty foods. BMI lowering via GIPR/GLP1R was associated with a lower preference for fatty foods and an increased preference for vegetarian foods. HbA1c lowering via GIPR/GLP1R also exhibited beneficial relationships with a liking for vegetarian food, albeit this impact was less consistent and generally weaker. HbA1c lowering by GIPR/GLP1R variants was associated with lower NAFLD, and GIPR primarily drove this relationship. No association was observed for alcohol-related liver disease (ALD). Further, HbA1c lowering via GIPR/GLP1R was consistently associated with lower ALT and GGT, which were mainly driven by GIPR. BMI lowering by GIPR variants also showed similar protective relationships with liver enzymes. Given the robust protective associations with heavy drinking behavior and documented links between cardiovascular disease and these behaviors, the researchers used two-step MR to investigate whether alcohol intake reductions mediate the cardioprotective effects of GLP1R and GIPR agonism on coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. This study showed that lowering BMI via GIPR/GLP1R reduces CAD risk, whereas binge drinking increases the risk, and that approximately 12.6% of the GIPR/GLP1R effect and 12.2% of the GIPR effect on CAD risk were mediated through reduced binge drinking. Exploratory analyses in non-European cohorts were underpowered and largely directionally consistent, so firm locus-specific conclusions could not be drawn. The authors interpret BMI-anchored associations as more consistent with behavioral or CNS-linked pathways, and HbA1c-anchored associations as more consistent with metabolic pathways, while noting that mechanistic confirmation requires clinical trials. The study also notes that genetic models cannot capture drug-specific effects, underscoring the need for future clinical trials to test translation.
