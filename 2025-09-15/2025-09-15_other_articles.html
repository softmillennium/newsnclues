                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Legend of Zelda series has never been known for coherent lore. Heck, one look at the timeline (if you can even call it one) and you'll see that the developers don't exactly have lore and narrative at the forefront of their minds when making these games. Having said that, it's still fun to dive into the story of the Zelda games and piece together what we do have. In doing that, the fan community has come across a lot of mysteries that are yet to be solved in any game. These are the biggest of those mysteries, and my best guess at what the answers to them might be. Its most obvious mystery, however, is the titular Majora's Mask itself. Beyond the mask itself, you have to wonder how the Happy Mask Salesman got his hands on it. I'd put my money on the fact that he had some hand in it all, personally. He doesn't seem innocent to me. In classic Zelda fashion, Tears of the Kingdom didn't answer all our questions from Breath of the Wild. For the Hyrule Royal Family line to continue after Rauru and Sonia are killed, they must have had a child offscreen. Why are they never with their parents? Maybe Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment will tell us, but I don't have high hopes. Once Link returns to his childhood, Navi flies off. Link goes to look for her, which leads him into the Lost Woods and the events of Majora's Mask. Is she off on another adventure now, with some other child who needs her? One of the big twists revealed in Skyward Sword is that Ghirahim is to Demise what Fi is to Link: a companion residing in a powerful sword. The Master Sword is an important part of Zelda lore and features in almost every game since its debut, so where is Demise's sword? Ganondorf doesn't really have a signature weapon like Link does, so we could assume it's the same sword, but this has never been confirmed. Twilight Princess is confirmed to be a sequel to Ocarina of Time, with Ganondorf in both games being the very same man, and Twilight Princess Link being a descendant of the Hero of Time. However, despite this connection, one aspect of Hyrule is very different: the Hyrule in Twilight Princess has no Gerudo. Instead of Gerudo Valley, in its place is Arbiter's Grounds. Twilight Princess doesn't tell us anything, so we'll just have to make up our own interpretation of events. At the end of Link's Awakening, it's revealed that Koholint Island, and everyone on it, was part of the Wind Fish's dream. Marin also ‘becomes' real by turning into a seagull, which was her wish. Was she always real (just not in the form of a girl), or was her wish so strong that she became real anyway? We never see Marin again, so we'll never find out if she was a dream-turned-real, or if she was real all along. I'd like to think she was a dream who became real, personally. It's a lot more whimsical that way. Well, we have another whopper from Majora's Mask. If you collect every single mask in the game, you can trade them in and get the Fierce Deity Mask, which transforms Link into an adult and gives him the Fierce Deity Sword. Aside from it being extremely powerful, we have next to no information about what the Fierce Deity actually is. Is it from the same place as Majora's Mask? Does the Fierce Deity actually look like that, or is it just adapting to Link's form? At every stable, and in lots of towns, you can find adorable dogs. But, I hear you asking, what about cats? Apparently, Calamity Ganon wiped out every single cat that ever lived in Hyrule. There's not a single one in the entire game, and they don't come back in Tears of the Kingdom either. Seriously, why is this world completely devoid of cats? Breath of the Wild has no such joys. I don't care about where the dragons came from or where BotW is on the timeline - I want to know where all the cats have gone!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Buried in all the news this week was another congressional hearing on UFOs. For some reason, our government now prefers the acronym UAP, which stood for Unidentified Aerial Phenomena until they changed it again Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. So, in other words, an unidentified flying object or UFO, right? The highlight of this week's congressional hearing was a leaked military video purportedly taken by a U.S. military MQ-9 Reaper Drone showing a hellfire missile striking sphere-like object in the skies off the coast of Yemen and having little to no effect. After watching the video, I was dumbfounded. I sought out some experts in the field. I spoke to a family member who served several tours in Afghanistan and he told me there is a chain of command and permission needed before a Hellfire Missile is fired. "I believe those are the most pertinent questions, but upon seeing this footage we also have to ask ourselves, what sort of technology could cause this result? The Hellfire Missile was designed for anti-armor attacks and is able to destroy any known armored vehicle in the world, and it lost. The target, while it seemed to lose a few bits and veered from its course momentarily, rebounded almost immediately and kept going. That's not a known technology we have here on Earth ... unless something else is being hidden from us, militarily or otherwise." Was it finally time to build my bunker in the backyard? Were the monsters really due on Maple Street? Not so fast, says Adam Frank, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Rochester whose research delves into Theoretical Astrophysics, and in particular the hydrodynamic and magneto-hydrodynamic evolution of matter. Frank said there are way too many unknowns to make any sort of scientific declaration based on what he described as a "grainy video with blobs on it that comes with a predigested story." "If you really want to know what it is, you've got to do a proper investigation of it," he said. "That means knowing what time of day is it? The other thing to take into account, Frank said, was that the object was not moving very fast since Hellfire Missiles are used mainly to attack stationary or slower-moving objects like tanks and helicopters. But the biggest takeaway from my discussion with Frank was something I hadn't noticed on the video or even considered. "It's not like you see the missile hit whatever the thing was and explode in a giant explosion and then the thing propagates away from it like in one of those science fiction movies," Frank said. "It looks like it's a glancing blow right which means that the targeting wasn't that great. You see it move, so this is not some kind of super alien technology which is impervious to anything, it kind of behaves like you might expect something to behave if it got a glancing blow from a fast moving object." OK, so maybe it's not from outer space. Florida Congresswoman and chair of Declassification of Federal Secrets Anna Paulina Luna, R-Florida, wants to know as well. She has been calling on the government to be more transparent when it comes to these types of things. "From Roswell to the coast of Jacksonville, the sightings of UFO's have rarely been explained by the people who have first-hand accounts of these situations," she said last year. "This is largely due to the lack of transparency by our own government and the failure of our elected leaders to make good on their promises to release explanations and footage and mountains of classified documents that continue to be hidden from the American people." I've only recently come across the term “Peer State Adversary,” meaning a country with similar technology as ours that is adversarial. Anyway, more likely than an alien spacecraft, the object on the video could be a drone operated by one of those adversarial countries. And if that's the case, Frank explains, the military would have good reason to keep tight-lipped about it. For example, Frank said, what if a country like China or Iran was testing the camera-spoofing technology of an experimental drone? Our military leaders would not want to tip their hand and reveal to those nations what we know about them. “As somebody who studies the possibility of life in the universe professionally, I would love if we found aliens," Frank said. "That would answer the question I've been interested in my whole life. But there's just nothing there to be able to make that giant leap without the right kind of scientific evidence." I gotta admit being relieved after speaking with Frank. Support local journalism and become a subscriber.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As a middle-aged nerd, I sometimes find myself referring to the movies of my childhood and being surprised by how weird they are by modern standards of political correctness. That's why I think you should watch Weird Science on Netflix, a raunchy ‘80s classic from legendary director John Hughes that is sure to become your new problematic fave. The insane plan works better than they could have ever hoped, and they bring a dream woman to life who can magically create everything from fake IDs to a sweet convertible. The cast of Weird Science is small but filled with big names, starting with Anthony Michael Hall (an ‘80s icon thanks to movies like The Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles) playing one of our unlucky-in-love teen protagonists. His partner in crime is Ilan Mitchell-Smith, who is best known outside of this movie for his role in the Superboy television show. Meanwhile, his character's grumpy older brother is played by Bill Paxton, the iconic actor sci-fi fans know best from his performance in Aliens (“game over, man, game over!”). Speaking of horror fans, they will be delighted to see Michael Berryman, the wide-eyed star of The Hills Have Eyes, in Weird Science. He is joined by fellow genre performer Vernon Wells, whose character is deliberately designed to resemble the actor's memorable character in Mad Max 2. The movie is undeniably of its time, and when rewatching it, I couldn't help but think how strange it would be if Weird Science were made today. Mainstream critics would likely decry our two main characters as terminally online incels, and everyone would make fun of their efforts to bring a glorified chatbot to life. While critics thought this was one of John Hughes' weaker teen comedies, Weird Science still has a 60 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, certifying this exemplar of sci-fi silliness as “fresh.” Audiences, amusingly enough, gave the film a score of 69 percent, which I'm pretty sure our teen main characters would have found amusing (maybe they'd give us a Bill and Ted-esque line delivery of “69, dude!”). That's why we eventually got a surprisingly solid TV show adaptation in 1994. Will you find Weird Science to be your new problematic fave, or is this one chaotic computer invention you'll want to put into your desktop's recycle bin?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More whistleblowers have spoken out about the truth about so-called Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) also called Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs). They are seeking, along with some members of Congress, protection, transparency, accountability and certainty about the origin of such craft. They want to attack and destroy it; but if a plane did get close enough to attempt to carry out this purpose, it would be destroyed instead. The White man has learned that this is not a plane to be played with. Planes come out of the Mother Plane.” Recently, the U.S. Congressional Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets called for more transparency after whistleblowers testified about their concerns and the existence of so-called UAPs/UFOs. During the “Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection” hearing held Sept. 9, witnesses comprised of military veterans and a counsel for the Project on Government Oversight called for the disclosure of such phenomena and information held by federal agencies. For too long, the issue of UAPs has been shrouded in secrecy, stigma, and in some cases outright dismissal, said task force Chairwoman, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), during opening remarks for the hearing. “Today, I want to state clearly: this is not science fiction or creating speculation. This is about national security, government accountability, and the American people's right to the truth,” she stated. Elected representatives are duty bound to follow the facts, wherever they lead, and to ensure those facts are not buried under classification stamps or bureaucratic excuses, continued Rep. Luna. U.S. Air Force veteran Jeffrey Nuccetelli said that between 2003 and 2005, five UAP incidents occurred at Vandenberg Air Force Base, home to the National Missile Defense Project, a top national security priority, she explained. They were conducting launches deemed by the National Reconnaissance Office as “the most important in 25 years,” said Mr. Nuccetelli, about incursions he said began on October 14, 2003. “Boeing contractors reported a massive, glowing red square silently hovering over two missile defense sites. After several minutes, it drifted east and vanished behind the hills,” he reported. Mr. Nuccetelli also reported a witness seeing a strange light over the ocean, heading toward the base. “The witness was later threatened and told to keep quiet about the incident, discouraging further reports,” he stated. In 2005, he said, he watched an object start “maneuvering like a butterfly and would vanish and reappear in a different patch of sky. The object dropped steadily in altitude, and it vanished, then reappeared 200 feet over my house. Alexandro Wiggins is an active duty U.S. Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer (Operations Specialist) with approximately 23 years of service, whose written testimony to the task force included seeing a “self-luminous, “Tic-Tac”-shaped object in his experience aboard USS Jackson on February 15, 2023, off the Southern California coast. The object then linked up with three similar objects, according to Chief Wiggins. “All four departed simultaneously in a highly synchronized, near-instantaneous manner. No sonic boom or conventional propulsion signatures were observed,” he continued. Chief Wiggins underscored the safety issue of crews observing objects that maneuver or accelerate in ways that do not match known profiles and do so near U.S. ships and aircraft. George Knapp, chief investigative reporter for KLAS-TV in Las Vegas, emphasized at the hearing he's not a whistleblower or a UFO witness, but became hooked on the subject because of massive paper trail piles of government documents which he said paints a very different picture than what the public, the press and Congress have been told about UFOs. “I was ticked off that they were lying to us,” said Mr. Knapp. Don't believe it,” evidence indicates otherwise, he said. “Documents from military and intelligence personnel behind closed doors admit that ‘these things are real.' He told the task force that he has testified to both the Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) and All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) with direct firsthand knowledge of and experience with craft and technologies “that are not ours and that are reportedly operating without Congressional oversight.” Then in the video, a Hellfire missile suddenly struck the unidentified object and bounced off it,” reported cbsnews.com. “‘We've never seen a Hellfire missile hit a target and bounce off,' said Lue Elizondo, a former senior intelligence official with the Pentagon,” the network reported. “There is no known equal of the Mother Plane. Master Fard Muhammad, to Whom praises are due forever, is the Wisest and Best Knower; He is the Mightiest of Them All,” the Most Honorable Elijah Muhammad wrote. She is capable of confusing you who would try to reach her with your means of destruction,” the Most Honorable Elijah Muhammad continued.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reddit user Exotic_Thing_2850 recently asked, "What's the creepiest, most unexplainable thing you've ever seen with your own eyes that still haunts you to this day?" And good luck sleeping tonight...or ever again! "I live in a rural area of my state. I was outside with my dogs at around 3:00 a.m. (a story all on its own). I called my dog to come inside with me and turned to walk away, but he was firmly planted, looking in the direction of the noise, and would not move. After about a minute, the sound of the drums stopped, and there was a roaring noise. It wasn't windy that night, but we were hit with a heavy gust of wind, and all the noise stopped. It thoroughly freaked out my dog...and me. "When my sister and I were very young, we had a sandbox in our backyard. One day, we were playing in it, and a hand came up from the sand, grabbed my sister, and pulled her down. We both ran to get our mom. To this day, we both still talk about that and can't explain what happened. "On multiple occasions, in 2004, when I was around 15, I'd suddenly wake up around 3:00 a.m. to find every single light on in the house. My mom worked nights, dad didn't live with us, and my brother and sister were still out cold when I checked. The water and lights at night terrified me so much that I ran and shook my older sister awake, yelling, 'Did you do this?!' She shrugged me off and had no idea what I was talking about. After a couple of nights of it, I started yelling for whoever was there to please stop. Related: People On Facebook Marketplace Have Quite Literally Never Been Wilder Than When They Posted These 37 Listings One night, shortly after heading to bed, we both heard a noise in the kitchen and immediately texted each other, 'Was that you?' We spent about three hours sitting on the patio, chain-smoking cigarettes (we had long stopped smoking at that point) to calm ourselves. We were too scared to go back inside." "A couple of nights later, we were watching TV on the couch. Neither of us was even close to it. My mom used to talk about a creepy, grinning version of my brother that she and a babysitter saw when he was little. My brother worked multiple jobs and was gone a lot. To help him make some extra cash, I would clean his room and do his laundry each week. I usually stayed up late Saturday nights to watch Mad TV and SNL while folding laundry. When I turned to look, my brother was peeking around the hallway wall at me with a super creepy grin on his face. All I could see were his hands holding the wall and his head sticking out around the corner, but that grin was freaky." "I instantly thought my brother was messing with me, so I said something along the lines of, 'Ugh. Fuck off,' and looked back at the TV. Then I remembered that he wasn't even home, and the hairs on my arms stood up. I looked back, and he was gone. But the next morning, I told my mom what I had seen, and she just nodded in understanding." "More cool than creepy, but when I was younger, we would always play hide and seek in the dark, but in the woods. One time, I was hiding in a tree, and I saw two kids walking on the path holding hands — a little girl and a boy about the same age. They were both dressed in early 1920s-style clothes and just walking super calmly as if they had nowhere to go. When I told my mom and described them, she mentioned seeing the same little boy multiple times as a child in her room. He would come from her antique armoire and just sit at the end of her bed. Not sure about the little girl, but it was so fascinating and trippy, even as a child. Just writing this gave me chills, but not in a bad way. They seemed to be very relaxed and not worried about me at all. "I was driving home from work and got struck by another car. As I was lying there, I noticed movement in a stand of trees a ways off from the road. I couldn't make out anything initially, except movement, until it stepped into the beams of my vehicle's headlights. And when it saw me, I could see its eyes light up. But all it ended up doing was standing over me and looking down at me as I stared up at it, too scared to so much as blink." "But after what felt like hours, the thing finally blinked, and next thing I know, I'm being loaded into the back of an ambulance." "I once saw a 'man' in my closet. I was around 9 or 10, and always had a vivid imagination. I was also terrified of the dark and had problems with nightmares and insomnia my whole life (I still do at 24, tbh). One night, I woke up and there was a man in my closet. He was tall, wearing a black suit and a blank white face, and had symbols on his cheeks (think Jigsaw's markings, but not swirls; they were symbols). I ran into my parents' room, sobbing. I didn't sleep in my own bed for weeks. I still don't 100% think it was a dream, but I'm not sure what else it could have been." Related: "What Goes Around Comes Around In The Sweetest Ways" — People Are Sharing The Cutest, Most Wholesome Posts I've Ever Seen, So Here Are 18 Of The Best I walked out of my room into the living room, and my mom was sitting in my rocker/swivel chair, knitting with her back to me, the TV at full blast, and all the lights on. I turned to look at the clock, and it was 3:44 a.m. My aunt 'R' had recently passed away, maybe two months earlier. My son randomly said, 'I see Aunt R!' We asked him where, and he said she was up on the hill watching us. There was a hill at this particular location, but there weren't any lights on it for him to see a person on it. Then, a couple of months ago, I was visiting my mom, and she mentioned that around this time, she was watching my son at their house, and he was playing in the backyard. She heard him talking to someone, carrying on a conversation, and when she asked whom he was taking to, he said it was Aunt R." "When I was in high school, my mom had a nightmare and we shared the experience. While we were all in bed (I sleep with my door open because of the pets), I heard her gasp, but didn't really think anything of it. A few moments later, a shadow as tall as my doorframe walked past my door. I got up and immediately started flicking on lights and asking if she had walked up the hallway. Of course, my mom saw since she was awake, and we walked through the house. I went to get into bed with her after we found nothing, and she was telling me about her nightmare, which was that a tall man in a wife-beater was at the end of her bed with an axe, swinging it towards her (which is why she gasped awake in the first place)." "While lying there, we heard and felt knocking on the bed's footboard. We just sat there in silence, holding each other's hands, until it stopped, and asked one another if we both heard it. My brother stayed asleep throughout the entire thing, and nothing else ever happened, but boy, that was a scary ass night. I definitely don't look at my doorway for too long at nighttime if I can help it, and I have fairy lights in my room, so it's never completely dark." "My sister and I were walking, and I said, 'Hey, let's take a detour through the woods for a change.' We get about one-third of the way through, and I hear someone shouting my name deep into the woods to my right. I freak out for a second and look at my sister, who is to my left. She is looking behind her, incredibly terrified. I look behind us but see nothing. She looks at me and tells me in a scared voice, 'I heard someone shout my name behind me and it sounded like our older brother, but as if he was young.' We both heard a voice of our older brother saying our names, but separately, in different places. "I had a very overactive imagination as a child, and it would often lead to either hallucinations or daydreams that blurred the line between real and not. One day, I blinked, and the white flowered bathroom wallpaper was replaced with a yellow and brown striped wallpaper. The vinyl floor was replaced with a lush brown carpet, and the vanity was replaced with a half-decomposed corpse that was somehow still alive enough to stare at me until I blinked again, and it disappeared." It was dark and there were no lights about. I got out of the car and rushed over, but there was no sign of her or anything that looked white, and there were no ripples in the water. What should've been a magical experience was actually terrifying. We awoke to loud, hard shuffling and thumping noises on our roof. We saw a robust man dressed in red with his back turned to us in front of our Christmas tree. It was weird, though; he looked like an old school movie projection with fuzzy edges and static. "We immediately looked in our parents' room. Our parents were asleep, and we could see them sleeping in bed from our room down the hall because they had the door open. We even heard our dad snoring, so it wasn't him. Santa Claus stood up straight, turned around, looked right at us, and with a twinkle in his eye, went 'shhhh' 🤫. That was when we screamed bloody murder, ran into our parents' room, and woke them up. My dad saw how terrified we were and ran into the living room. Eerily enough, wet snow was on the living room floor and fine gold glitter everywhere. My dad, suspecting my uncle was playing a trick on us, angrily called him on the phone and demanded to know why he would do such a thing to scare us. He had no idea what my dad was talking about. My parents called the cops and everything. I still remember the red and blue lights flooding our living room when they filed a police report. I'm 32 now, and my sister is 34, and we still remember the morning we saw Santa Claus. It was downright chilling, and I can't believe that happened to us. Nothing this overtly paranormal has ever happened to me since then." It was a big church with a loud bell that you would hear every day at noon. It was tall, masculine, had red eyes, and wore a top hat. "It would never enter my room or make a sound. It would just stand at the other side of the house and slowly make its way down the hallway until it stopped at my door. I remember many nights just lying in bed facing the white wall in my room, waiting until I was too tired to stay awake. There were other times when I remember hearing family members calling out from throughout the house or basement when they weren't there. I was told to never listen unless they responded, which they never did, or at least I don't remember. My sisters and mom said they heard the same thing as adults. My parents divorced when I wasn't much older, so I never got to investigate it. The whole family talks about it now, as we're all older and have all had strange experiences. But those weird memories never left, and thinking back as a 28-year-old, they still give me the chills." "When I was around 4 years old, I remember looking out of my bedroom window and seeing cars driving through our side yard. Instead of looking like our yard, it looked like an actual road, and the cars looked old-fashioned, like they were from the 1940s (this was in the 1970s). Our house was in a plan of homes with pretty large lots, and the through street ran in a completely different area. Naturally, I was frightened by what I saw and ran to tell my mother and older sister. They dismissed it and said I was either dreaming or making things up. My sister occasionally would tease me about it over the years, and for some reason, every time I was in that part of the yard, I would get a creepy feeling that I shouldn't be there." "I must have been about 12 or 13, and my grandmother was visiting. She told my sister and me that when she was a young girl, our neighborhood was part of a farm, and the main road used to run right through our side yard. My sister and I looked at each other. "One night, when I was a kid, I woke up in the middle of the night. I would leave my bedroom door open as a kid, and my parents' room was to the right of mine, down the hallway. Suddenly, a figure appeared in the dark doorway, and it looked like my mom. I was just looking at her from my bed, confused why she was just standing there. Then out of nowhere, she screamed as loud as she could and stepped back out of my doorway. I remember just lying in bed, freaked out, for a long while before I finally fell back asleep.

I immediately got annoyed because I figured this was just another lie coming out of her mouth. And as I was about to tell her that, something grabbed my ankle. I was immediately pulled from the couch to the floor, and then my friend and I just stared at each other. I thought the friend was playing a trick on me, but she was a good 10 feet away from me. It ended with all three of us leaving the house for a while." One evening, as the sun had begun to set, my brother and I were driving back home on the southern side of town, where it turns from your average outlet shopping areas into cornfields. It had started to get dark enough that the car's headlights turned on, but you could still see the scenery fairly well. As we turned, the headlights illuminated this tall humanoid creature resembling a deer standing on its hind legs, full-on sprinting away into the cornfield. The stalks were only about shin height at the time, so I could see it for maybe three seconds. Judging by the distance it travelled across the field in that time, it had to have been moving faster than any regular person could run." My brother, however, confirmed my fears by asking if I had just witnessed what he had. The worst part is knowing it was less than a few hundred feet from my house." "When my son was 2 years old, we lived in a house with interior doors (living room, dining room, kitchen, etc.). The doors also had handles rather than knobs. My son was napping, and I was sitting at my desk in the living room with the door closed. While sitting there, I watched the door handle completely depress, as if someone was about to open it. I figured my son was being cheeky, and got up to open the door myself. No one was on the other side. I checked on my son immediately, and he was sound asleep in bed. "I was 20 years old and lived at home with my parents. I woke up one night to see what I thought was my dad sitting on a chair at the foot of the bed. He was facing me, but I couldn't make out any features as it was dark. I got up and walked past this figure, who was still sitting and looking at the bed. I was about six feet away from it when I turned on the light, and then he faded away. Yep, I haven't slept in darkness for the last 20 years, and if a chair is in the room, I have to turn it away from the bed." 23.And: "My husband left to run errands, so I started cleaning the house while he was gone. I watched him walk into our son's room and followed him to see what was happening. When I walked into the room, no one was there. That was over 10 years ago, and I still can't make sense of it."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Search and Support San Antonio, organized the operation in hopes of uncovering new evidence in the disappearance of Katelyn "Kate" Vara, who vanished more than a year ago. According to her family, she left her home on Maria Elena Drive, near Culebra Road, to attend a medical appointment. She made it to the appointment, but never returned home, leaving behind her young son. San Antonio police say someone called 911 from Vara's phone at a Northeast-side motel, but the caller hung up. Officers responding to the scene spoke with witnesses who claimed Vara had been assaulted, though no evidence was found at the motel. Joining Sunday's search was psychic medium Vic Andrea, who has been working with Vara's mother, Valerie Mendoza, since February. “She is simply looking to gain closure,” Andrea said. Andrea claims she receives visions and impressions from conversations with family members, which help identify potential “hot spots” for search efforts. "Based off those notes, I get visions, signs, and feelings. That leads me to specific areas, what I would call a hot spot." Andrea's guidance led volunteers to the location on Sunday. “We had a psychic who gave us some information, and it actually was corroborated by the police,” Herr said. “We're still very interested in this area,” Herr said. Vara's case remains an active investigation by the San Antonio Police Department. Andrea, the psychic medium, previously assisted a caregiver, and authorities in finding a missing elderly man, in January of this year. Anyone with information about Katelyn Vara's disappearance is urged to contact San Antonio Police's Missing Persons Unit.</p>
