                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Olivia Moultrie's 20th birthday is just days away on Sept. 17, but before that, the 19-year-old made history by becoming the highest-scoring teenager in NWSL history. Moultrie tallied her 14th career goal for the Portland Thorns in a 1-1 draw to the Chicago Red Stars on Sunday. In the 12th minute, Moultrie launched a 20-yard strike off a free kick that arched above the Red Stars goalkeeper's reach. In an interview after the goal during the broadcast, Moultrie said while she didn't realize that goal set the record, scoring off set pieces was something she had been working on with assistant coaches. The Thorns midfielder tied the milestone last month, before surpassing fellow USWNT midfielder Jaedyn Shaw, who previously held the record for most NWSL goals scored by a teenager. Shaw scored in her club debut this past weekend as the 20-year-old continues the strong start to her career she had as a teenager. The future is bright for both midfielders. Her career high for a single season is seven, which she set in 2024. Moultrie made her NWSL debut when she was just 15 years old and later became the youngest player in the league to score at 16 years old in 2022. In 2023, she earned her first USWNT cap and has made nine total appearances and scored two international goals.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the World Cup in Philly next summer, Lemon Hill Park will host the five-week FIFA Fan Festival with watch parties, food vendors and other activities for soccer fans. Above, a rendering of the festival grounds. With about eight months before Philadelphia hosts its first World Cup 2026 match, work is underway to get Lemon Hill Park ready for thousands of soccer fans expected to attend watch parties at the FIFA Fan Festival next summer. The site will have big screen monitors to watch matches, activity stations and vendors selling food and merchandise. Although the city's five World Cup matches will be played at Lincoln Financial Field, in South Philly, Lemon Hill Park was picked as the festival grounds because of its sweeping views of Center City, city officials said. Planners hope the atmosphere will resemble Brazil's beaches and Germany's town squares during past World Cups. The roughly 46-acre area is getting a series of upgrades to make the space more inviting and accessible. People who visit the park in the coming months can expect to see a range of construction activity, road closures and detours. The Streets Department also will make improvements to about 1,700 feet of sidewalks along Sedgley Drive, Poplar Drive and Girard Avenue. Temporary parking restrictions will be in place during milling, paving and line striping activity. The Philadelphia Water Department also plans to install drinking water stations in multiple areas of Lemon Hill Park. Other park upgrades include improved electrical service and the installation of security cameras. Philadelphia is one of 16 World Cup host cities in the the United States, Canada and Mexico. FIFA's expanded format in 2026 will feature 104 matches over 39 days, headlined by a new knockout round of 32 national teams that will be drawn from the best of 12 groups of four teams. Lincoln Financial Field will have group-stage matches on June 14, 19, 22, 25 and 27. One Round of 16 match will be played there on July 4, coinciding with the city's celebration of the nation's 250th birthday. Specific matches in the group stage will not be known until after FIFA's World Cup draw in December. The festival at Lemon Hill Park is part of a busy summer schedule in Philadelphia, where Citizens Bank Park is slated to host the 2026 MLB All-Star Game on July 14. FIFA opened up its first ticket presale for World Cup matches last week, inviting Visa cardholders to enter a lottery-style drawing to gain early access to tickets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Norwegian Football Federation (NFF) has said profits from Norway's World Cup qualifier against Israel in October will go to Doctors Without Borders, an organisation providing humanitarian relief in Gaza. The NFF announced on Monday its collaboration with the independent organisation, which has provided emergency medical care in over 70 countries affected by wars, natural disasters and epidemics. Israel's military invaded Gaza after Hamas's attacks in October 2023, and more than 60,000 people have died in the region, according to the local health ministry. “We have an opportunity to qualify for an international men's championship for the first time in 26 years,” NFF president Lise Klaveness said in a statement. “As a member of FIFA and UEFA, the NFF must deal with Israel's participation in their competitions. “We want to give the profits to an organisation that saves lives in the Gaza Strip every day and that contributes with active emergency aid on the ground, and that is what Doctors Without Borders does.” The NFF added that since their announcement, one of Norway's largest investment companies — who wish to remain anonymous — has also pledged three million Krone ($305,000, £224,200) towards Doctors Without Borders. Lindis Hurum, secretary of Doctors Without Borders, said the organisation is “completely dependent on private funds” and that the money “will save lives”. Klaveness has previously called on FIFA to investigate Israel's participation in its competitions, saying “football must not be used in a way that undermines internationally recognised rights or established legal principles”. The NFF also provided a donation towards a football project for children in Gaza, and has undergone a long-term initiative working with Palestinian schools and refugee camps, as well as opening coaching pathways for women and girls.</p>

The Kansas City Council approved a “temporary pause on permit fees” for sidewalk cafes, street cafes and mini park spaces for dining establishments and will help in offering more attractive spaces for resident and visitors for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, according to Chris Higgins of the K.C. STAR. The pause will last three years and could “save restaurants $850 in fees annually while potentially boosting their sales.” Officials also said that will “help clear a barrier for small businesses, particularly those in areas with fewer resources, while increasing economic activity and tax revenue for the city” (K.C. STAR, 9/15). 

WATCHDOGS: In Atlanta, Matt Reynolds noted as Atlanta readies for the World Cup, a new coalition called Play Fair ATL is vowing to hold officials accountable for their promises on housing, along with the rights of immigrants and workers. Headed by former Color of Change Senior Dir Michael Collins, the coalition has formed as host cities “submit their human rights plans to the sport's governing body.” Collins said that Play Fair ATL will “watchdog the city and Partners for HOME,” the nonprofit overseeing the city's homeless strategy, as it “aims to clear camps in the downtown area and house people by the end of the year under a plan known as Downtown Rising.” On board are the social justice group American Friends Service Committee; the labor group Georgia AFL-CIO; the Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights (GLAHR); the NAACP Legal Defense Fund; the Southern Center for Human Rights; the Union of Southern Service Workers; and criminal justice reform group, Women on the Rise (ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION, 9/13).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bellingham included in the 23-man Real Madrid UCL squad. After a tormenting injury lay-off, Jude Bellingham has made his highly anticipated return to the Real Madrid setup. The 22-year-old has been included in the Los Blancos squad for their 2025-26 UEFA Champions League opener against Olympique de Marseille. Bellingham joined Real Madrid in June 2023, with huge aspirations to win the La Liga and Champions League crowns. Completing the league + UCL double, Bellingham's supremely impressive stats made the then manager Carlo Ancelotti term him “a veteran.” With 36 goals and 24 assists to his name, Jude Bellingham is well and truly a key inclusion in the Real Madrid midfield. Slotting in as an attacking midfielder and an occasional false-nine, Xabi Alonso will be delighted that the Englishman has returned to match fitness. Jude Bellingham underwent shoulder surgery in July, and wasn't expected to return until October.…he's back in Real Madrid's squad to face Marseille on Tuesday 💪 pic.twitter.com/5cz4luIqJL On Monday, Real Madrid confirmed that Jude Bellingham has been included in the match-day squad for their upcoming UEFA Champions League group stage match against Marseille. The box-to-box midfielder suffered a shoulder dislocation during Real Madrid's encounter against Rayo Vallecano in November 2023. Yet, the road to recovery has been more than successful for the midfielder – as Real Madrid said ‘Hey Jude' by welcoming their pivotal cog back to the 23-man squad to face Marseille on Wednesday. Will Real Madrid continue their invincible start to the 2025-26 outing after Jude Bellingham's return?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, who won the Democratic nomination on a platform of making the city more affordable, is now calling on soccer's global governing body to make it cheaper for New Yorkers to attend the World Cup. In a petition released Wednesday, Mamdani demanded FIFA reverse its plan to set ticket prices for next year's tournament based on demand, likening the practice to “price gouging.” The Democratic socialist, who dubbed his campaign “Game Over Greed,” also called for 15% of tickets to be set aside at discounted prices for residents. “As a lifelong football — sorry, I mean soccer fan, I couldn't be more excited,” Mamdani said in an accompanying social media video, affecting a faux-British accent as he juggled a soccer ball in his dress shoes. As with past years, some tickets will be set aside for “specific fan categories” at fixed prices, according to the spokesperson, who noted the details around eligibility and pricing were still being worked out. In recent days, FIFA's plan to adopt a dynamic pricing model — similar to the one used by airlines or hotels — has sparked controversy among some fans. Tickets will start at $60 for group-stage matches and increase to $6,730 for the final, officials said last week, but could fluctuate under the demand-based pricing model. Mamdani also called on the governing body to implement a cap on resale ticket prices — something it has agreed to do in Mexico, but not in the United States or Canada. A spokesperson for FIFA said the cap on resale prices in Mexico was a result of the country's strict laws around secondary ticket markets. Mamdani, who surged to victory in the primary based on promises such as freezing rent for New Yorkers and making buses free, situated the World Cup fight as part of his larger battle against rising costs for working people.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a World Cup in Russia (2018) and a winter edition in Qatar (2022), and with an expanded, itinerant edition across three continents on the horizon (2030) and another journey to the Persian Gulf (Saudi Arabia 2034), it was by no means easy to legitimize the 2026 edition as a controversial World Cup. Yet, according to promises from both the U.S. and FIFA presidents, it is “an event that can lift global spirits”, for which “we look forward to welcoming the fans”. “But since you are a winner, you can touch it.” “Can I keep it?” – Trump replied, wearing a hat with the inscription Trump Was Right About Everything. “It would look good on that wall.” The scene took place during one of many visits by the football chief to Washington and was broadcast worldwide within minutes. In August 2018, in the same walls, Infantino had presented Trump, then in the middle of his first term, with a personalized number 45 jersey (referencing his presidency) and a referee kit, “so he could send someone off.” A perfect setup for showing it off to the journalists present—no migrants nearby, after all—with the usual mix of joking, intimidation, and inappropriateness. Political guarantees were formally documented by Washington between 2017 and the FIFA Congress vote in June 2018. “It will be impossible not to notice him next summer,” wrote Alexander Abnos in The Guardian, “Trump will make sure he is at the center of attention, even in places where he has no interest or where his involvement might be seen as inappropriate: a dynamic Americans know well, more than a decade after Trump's rise.” Speaking of unnecessary invitations, during Infantino's latest visit two weeks ago, Trump once again pulled out a classic media ace. Showing cameras a photo of himself with Vladimir Putin and mentioning the Russian president's willingness to attend next summer's World Cup matches. Yet another unsettling vignette reminding us how much the football showcase will be shaped by his personalistic and political direction. Legally, since February 2022 (the invasion of Ukraine), Putin has been listed on OFAC's SDN list, which blocks assets and transactions with U.S. persons—not an automatic entry ban, but an obstacle for visa approval and public opinion. Outside U.S. borders, since March 2023, Putin is under an ICC arrest warrant for war crimes and illegal deportation of minors; while the U.S. is not bound by this, Canada and Mexico are. How could the global audience legitimize Putin's presence while simultaneously excluding athletes who certainly do not bear the same responsibility as him—if any—for what is happening in Ukraine? It should be noted that Israel's lack of a ban in the same competitions already provides clear evidence of double standards, but Putin in the stands in New York and Miami would be very hard for American and European audiences to accept. In 2018, as mentioned, guarantees and standards for entry and anti-discrimination policies were put on the table to win the bid. Today, however, the call to respect those same promises comes not from FIFA—which seems to have forgotten everything in favor of the Infantino-Trump relationship—but from NGOs and human rights observers, such as Amnesty, Human Rights Watch, and the Sport & Rights Alliance, who, a year before the event, are demanding a public and mandatory Human Rights Framework for 2026, conflicting with increasingly restrictive U.S. immigration and public order policies. Trump raised tariffs on neighbors with trade war rhetoric, revived the narrative of Canada as the 51st state, and suggested military operations and political interventions in Mexican territory to combat drug cartels. Un post condiviso da European Athletes & Players Association (@eapassociation) Then there are the issues inherited from Qatar 2022, resurfacing in practical terms. The 2025 trial run showed heatwaves and unexpected stoppages due to extreme weather, and academic studies (Queen's University Belfast) indicate that ten out of sixteen venues are at very high risk of heat stress in the summer of 2026. Players' stance, expressed in a FIFPRO open letter, is clear: implement cooling breaks when temperatures exceed 28°C, and postpone any match beyond the 32°C limit. There is also the labor issue, inherited from Doha and relevant for future World Cup editions. In March, the union BWI accused FIFA of denying access to Estadio Azteca (Mexico City) for an independent inspection, and months of pressure were needed for a site visit on July 9. Starting in 2024, Saudi Aramco became a FIFA Major Worldwide Partner until 2027, including the 2026 edition and the path toward 2034 in Saudi Arabia. This choice underlines how FIFA's declared neutrality is increasingly, in reality, a policy of deliberate alliances and handshakes with actors who routinely violate the foundational values of sport: inclusion, hospitality, anti-discrimination, and respect for human, civil, and labor rights.

The Croatian is still producing midfield masterclasses at 40 years of age, while the egalitarian environment at Barcelona is reaping rewards

Play has resumed in Europe after the international break and, along with Liverpool in England, we still have five teams boasting flawless records in the other ‘Big 5' leagues.

Unsurprisingly, defending champions Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain continue to lead the way in Germany and France, respectively. In Italy, Napoli have also made the perfect start to their Serie title defence but a resurgent Juventus are keeping pace with Antonio Conte's team, while Real Madrid are four from four in Spain despite playing with 10 men for an hour on Saturday.

Of course, there were plenty of other major talking points over the weekend, so who were the big winners and losers from the latest round of action across the continent? GOAL breaks it all down below...</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This historic change is set to redefine the way in which the world's biggest sporting event plays out. Still, at the same time, it also raises questions about quality, logistics and tradition. Fans all over the world are already looking forward to the feel of a tournament on an unprecedented scale, with announcements of the World Cup 2026 tickets and early details of match schedules. The jump to 48 teams alters this balance completely. For many countries that have struggled to qualify in their regions because of the massive competition, the door is now open. This inclusivity will ensure that fans from more corners of the globe will see their national flags represented on the grandest stage of football. The prospect of greater representation fits in with the World Cup's identity as a genuinely global festival. However, inevitably, there are worries about whether the quality of play will still be at the same elite level. For smaller footballing nations, the expansion is a once-in-a-generation opportunity. The experience of playing against the best in the world can catalyze development in football back home, inspiring new generations of players and driving investment in infrastructure. With the increasing number of teams involved, there will likely be more cases of mismatched fixtures in which footballing heavyweights will be pitted against inexperienced teams that have little hope of winning. Some of the best World Cup memories have come from when underdogs defied odds and expectations, like Cameroon in 1990 or Costa Rica in 2014. With over 100 games to be played in multiple cities in three vast countries, travel and scheduling will become a larger factor than ever before. Teams may be required to travel great distances from fixture to fixture with little or no rest time between. For players who already have gruelling schedules with their clubs, the demands of a longer World Cup could take its toll on physical limits. Squad depth will prove more important, as managers will have to rotate effectively to ensure that their players are kept fresh. Teams with deep rosters of talent may be better positioned to deal with the grind, while lesser teams could falter under the pressure. For fans, the expansion is all opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, an increase in games means more opportunities to attend games and support their countries. The spread of games throughout the United States, Mexico and Canada also means that fans from different regions have an easier time accessing matches without having to travel across continents. On the other hand, such a large tournament may make it more difficult for travelling fans to follow their teams consistently, as fixtures may be scheduled thousands of miles apart. Ticket demand is already high with anticipation growing as details of matchdays continue to emerge. Supporters are making sure they get their places in stadiums because this World Cup will be like no other in terms of scale and energy. Balancing accessibility and affordability will be crucial if the tournament is to maintain its reputation as a global festival for fans, rather than simply a commercial venture. The 2026 World Cup is not just another version of football's most significant event - it is a turning point in the game's history. The move from 32 to 48 teams is a more expansive vision of inclusivity, expansion and global participation. It provides hope to emerging nations, it provides excitement to fans wanting new stories and it allows players to make their mark on the biggest stage. Yet with these opportunities come challenges that cannot be ignored.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even in a heavy defeat, Gio Reyna has the U.S. men's national team and the 2026 FIFA World Cup in his sights. The American midfielder made his debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach on Sunday following his transfer from Borussia Dortmund. Yet, it didn't go to plan, with a 4–0 defeat against Werder Bremen dropping Gladbach to 16th in the Bundesliga after three matches. After arriving from Dortmund on a transfer worth up to a reported $7 million, Reyna did not appear in the club's first two matches of the season with a focus on building up his fitness, before eventually making his first start on Sunday. 10 role, where he helped create a chance with a through ball to Robin Hack, and mustered three shots of his own on a day where his side were heavily outplayed. While the loss won't turn many heads, his return to regular minutes in the German top flight grabbed attention, especially with him expressing his belief and hope that he will be on Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT roster come the summer. “I'm in open contact with the coach [Mauricio Pochettino]. “I am now at a point where I want to take the next step and take my career to a higher level. Should he hope to play at the World Cup, he will not only need to improve his form and play significant minutes, but earn a call to an earlier USMNT camp, after Pochettino said the team will start to focus on its World Cup roster build following a September window that featured a loss to South Korea and win against Japan. Gladbach return to Bundesliga action on Sept. 21 against Bayer Leverkusen, with Reyna and Scally eyeing October USMNT friendlies against Australia and Ecuador. “Of course, I want to be back in [the USMNT], but I know that's only possible with playing time and performing well,” Reyna said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bayern Munich director of sport Max Eberl has been discussing Chelsea's Club World Cup triumph. Whatever the case, for Eberl, Chelsea were worthy winners of the trophy, and the Bayern director is now looking forward to watching his club go up against them later this week. “I'm really excited about Wednesday's match,” the 51-year-old told Bild. “I think Chelsea deserved to win the final, with their incredible energy. They haven't gotten any worse since then. “On the contrary, they will of course have become even more stable. But this energy is precisely our game, too. In the summer, it was claimed that the status of world champions had made Chelsea a more appealing destination for players. Glory in the US has not raised expectations at Stamford Bridge, though. Eberl has also spoken about Nicolas Jackson, who joined Bayern from Chelsea on the final day of the summer transfer window. “He had other offers, even for a permanent transfer,” the former Bayern player said, as he discussed Jackson's loan move to the Allianz Arena. Harry Kane has discussed Jackson, too, describing his new teammate as a “great addition” to Vincent Kompany's squad. Maresca's men will have to keep both men quiet to have a chance of getting a positive result at the Allianz Arena.</p>
