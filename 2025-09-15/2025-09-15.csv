            The White House has requested an additional $58 million in security funding for the executive and judicial branches following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, a Republican congressional aide said.
    


            The funding request is being “actively processed” in the context of a stopgap funding bill, the aide said. Lawmakers are facing a looming end-of-month deadline to fund the government and stave off a shutdown, with House GOP leaders expected to move this week on a bill.
    


            The request, first reported by Punchbowl News, comes amid heightened concerns in Washington about security for public officials, including among members of Congress, in the wake of the Kirk assassination.
    


            Senate Republicans will be briefed on security issues by the Senate Sergeant at Arms office and US Capitol Police during their weekly conference lunch on Tuesday, a source familiar with the matter said. US Senate Sergeant at Arms Jennifer Hemingway and US Capitol Police Chief Michael Sullivan are expected to attend the GOP policy lunch after being invited by Senate Majority Leader John Thune.
    


            In July, following the fatal shootings targeting state lawmakers in Minnesota, the House increased security funding and resources for lawmakers in their home districts as part of a new program. House Speaker Mike Johnson previously said that approximately 60 Democrats and 20 Republicans took advantage of the program, and he wants to examine what worked and what didn't.
    


            On Sunday, Johnson said he's been working to reassure House members about their personal security and congressional leaders are looking at “all the options” to bolster it.
    


            “I've been talking with a lot of them over the last few days about that and trying to calm the nerves to assure them that we will make certain that everyone has a level of security that's necessary,” he said over the weekend on CBS' “Face the Nation.”
    


            The speaker echoed calls from leaders from both parties on Capitol Hill urging lawmakers to “turn down the rhetoric.”
    


            “There are some deranged people in society, and when they see leaders using that kind of language so often now, increasingly, it spurs them on to action,” he said, adding that he's “heartened” to see “many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are stepping up and saying that.”

Finland's economic growth has suffered due to sanctions on Russia linked to the Ukraine conflict, Prime Minister Petteri Orpo has admitted. He noted that Finland has lost nearly all trade with Russia and billions in investments since it closed the border with its neighbor.

Finland, which shares a 1,300km (800-mile) border with Russia, has imposed several rounds of sanctions on Moscow in line with EU policy since 2022. It has also tightened entry rules for Russian citizens and shut all but one border checkpoint with its neighbor. The moves saw trade between the two countries drop to $1.5 billion in 2024, compared with $11 billion in pre-conflict 2021.

In an interview with Yle Areena on Saturday, Orpo acknowledged that sanctions have hit Finland harder than most EU members due to its traditionally close trade ties with Russia.

“The fact that the border is closed means, for example, 10 million cubic meters of Russian timber for our industry is not coming in. Finnish companies have lost billions in investments in Russia. Nearly all border traffic and trade have stopped,” Orpo said. “That brings uncertainty. All this has led to the fact that the growth of the Finnish economy has not been as desired.”

Despite this, Orpo echoed other NATO members in claiming Russia remains a “permanent threat” to Finland and the EU, vowing to increase defense spending and militarization to counter it. Finland joined NATO in 2023, a step Moscow – which views the bloc's expansion as a trigger of the Ukraine conflict – called a “historic mistake.”

Russia has repeatedly rejected claims it poses a threat, accusing the West of fueling Russophobia to justify military buildups and divert attention from domestic problems. It has condemned Western sanctions as illegal and warned they would backfire.

The Finnish economy slipped into recession in both 2023 and 2024. According to Eurostat, its growth projections for 2025 are the lowest in the EU.

European NATO members' vulnerability to a large-scale drone attack was exposed by the recent incident in Poland allegedly involving Russian UAVs, according to several media outlets, including Politico and Austria's Kurier daily.

The Polish government reported 19 violations of its airspace by alleged Russian drones on Wednesday, calling the incident “unprecedented” and requesting an emergency UN Security Council meeting. Moscow rejected the accusations of a deliberate “attack,” saying Warsaw's claims lack evidence and are being amplified by the “European party of war.”

During the incident, NATO forces reportedly scrambled Dutch F-35 fighter jets, along with an Italian surveillance plane and a German Patriot air defense system, to track and intercept the UAVs, Politico reported.

Kurier said drones costing just over $11,000 were shot down with air-to-air missiles worth $400,000 each. The paper also lamented that only 7 out of 19 drones were intercepted. The Polish authorities said that only three or four were actually downed, while the rest did not pose a threat.

The incident was discussed during a meeting between NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and EU ambassadors in Brussels on Thursday. According to Politico, many participants acknowledged the bloc's lack of readiness to defend against these types of attacks.

Officials said NATO could not feasibly deploy F-35 jets every time to intercept drones. “Rutte himself concluded that, and no one disagreed,” a diplomat familiar with the meeting told the outlet.

Polish media also questioned the country's preparedness. Rzeczpospolita described Poland as “powerless” against drones and reported that the recently acquired SkyCTRL anti-drone systems already require modernization and upgrades.

According to internal NATO calculations cited by the Financial Times in May, the US-led military bloc has only 5% of the air defenses needed to adequately protect member states in Eastern Europe, the Baltics, and Scandinavia.

The Russian Defense Ministry stated that all of its recent drone operations were aimed solely at Ukrainian military targets and not at Poland. Moscow reiterated its readiness to hold constructive consultations with Warsaw, as opposed to engaging in “megaphone diplomacy.”

Russia has rejected claims that it plans to attack NATO, calling the speculation “nonsense.” President Vladimir Putin has accused Western governments of deceiving their populations in order to justify inflated military budgets and distract from domestic economic problems.

An Israeli national known as the ‘Tinder Swindler' has been arrested upon arrival in Georgia, according to local media reports, citing the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs. The ministry confirmed the move was based on an international arrest warrant issued by Interpol.

Simon Leviev gained international notoriety after the 2022 Netflix documentary ‘The Tinder Swindler' revealed how he scammed several women he met on the dating app by posing as the son of Israeli billionaire and diamond magnate Lev Leviev, defrauding the women of an estimated $10 million

“I spoke with him this morning after the detention, but we still don't know the cause,” his attorney Shagiv Rotenberg told the Walla news outlet on Monday, adding that Leviev had been traveling freely before the arrest.

Using the fake identity, he lured women by showcasing a lavish lifestyle on Tinder, filled with private jets and luxury yachts, convincing them that he was a wealthy heir. Once trust was established, he persuaded them to lend him large sums of money under false pretenses and never repaid them.

Prior to the Tinder scheme, Leviev had been imprisoned in Finland and Israel for a range of crimes, including forgery, theft, and leaving a five-year-old he was babysitting unattended.

In December 2024, a Tel Aviv court ordered him to pay 415,000 shekels ($124,000) to one of his victims, Kate Conlin. According to the lawsuit, Leviev threatened Conlin and forced her to take out loans in several banks in her name but failed to repay the money.

Among the new lawsuits filed against Leviev is a claim from Iren Tranov for 414,000 shekels ($123,500), as well as a lawsuit from the Leviev family for reputational damage.

NEW YORK, September 15. /TASS/. US special envoy Steve Witkoff sold his stake in the Witkoff Group for $120 million, Bloomberg reported, citing a financial disclosure.

According to the agency, Witkoff took the step to prevent a potential conflict of interest between his government role and business activities. The declaration, submitted in August, lists June 30 as the start date for his position as the US president's special envoy for peacekeeping missions, although he had already begun working with President Donald Trump's team before the inauguration.

Bloomberg notes that Witkoff's declared assets exceed $350 million, including stakes in SpaceX, Cisco Systems, and Uber Technologies. He also reported debts exceeding $31 million, primarily related to loans for an aircraft purchase.

In his role in the Trump administration, Witkoff is responsible for addressing conflicts in the Middle East and managing issues related to the Ukrainian crisis. He has made several trips to Russia, where he has met with Russian leaders, including President Vladimir Putin, to discuss the Ukrainian settlement. On August 19, Witkoff told Fox News that he had spent roughly 24-25 hours in meetings with Putin and his inner circle.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

""Zelensky coordinates every step with Western curators, even though he still manages to mess things up. That's why no one will let him into Moscow.

Ryder Corral held as secretary of state Rubio doubles down on pledges to remove visas for critics of far-right activist

A 19-year-old man has been arrested on allegations of vandalizing a memorial to Charlie Kirk as the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, doubled down on pledges to remove visas for Kirk critics.

Ryder Corral was arrested at 9.50am on Sunday by police in Phoenix, Arizona after witnesses say they saw a man damaging a memorial for Kirk outside the headquarters of Turning Points USA, the organisation Kirk led.

“Officers were in the area to assist with traffic control due to a large community presence in the area following recent events,” said Sgt Phil Krynsky, a spokesperson for Phoenix police. Corral now faces criminal damage and disorderly conduct charges.

Videos posted online showed a man walking through the memorial over flowers and other mementoes before he was grabbed by another man, thrown to the ground, and arrested by nearby officers.

The man in the videos was later identified by Krynsky as Corral, according to Arizona Central.

News video showed Corral wearing a T-shirt showing an American flag and an eagle that was similar to one worn in surveillance photos by Kirk's suspected killer, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, whose arrest was announced on Friday after a two-day manhunt. But police have not said whether they believe Corral meant to genuinely express anything with the shirt.

Robinson was “not cooperating” with authorities after the arrest and had not confessed to carrying out the shooting, Utah's governor, Spencer Cox, told news shows on Sunday. The governor said authorities were still trying to establish a motive for the killing, though Cox made it a point to say investigators' interviews with people close to Robinson revealed the suspect had views that were in opposition to Kirk's.

Kirk was killed on Wednesday at an open-air event held by Turning Point USA at Utah Valley University.

Later on Monday, Rubio, who is visiting Jerusalem and met with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, gave an interview to Fox News in which he reiterated the threat to remove visas for those who “celebrate” Kirk's killing.

“We should not be giving visas to people who are going to come to the United States and do things like celebrate the murder, the execution, the assassination of a political figure. And if they're already here, we should be revoking their visa,” he said.

“Why would we want to bring people into our country if they're going to engage in negative and destructive behavior?”

CNN reported that Rubio's deputy, Chris Landau, said last week that he had told consular officers “to undertake appropriate action” when assessing visas for anyone “praising, rationalizing, or making light of” the death of Kirk, who espoused bigoted, extreme, white nationalist views.

Kirk's funeral service is set to be held on 21 September at the 63,000-seat stadium where the NFL's Arizona Cardinals play. The stadium is in a suburb of Phoenix.

Also on Sunday but in Utah, authorities said they had arrested two men on suspicion of placing an incendiary device under a Fox News media vehicle in Salt Lake City.

The bomb did not go off, having been lit but failing to function as designed, according to court records cited by the Utah CBS affiliate KUTV.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Lee Jae Myung says ‘bewildering' incident may scare off future investment after Ice detained about 475 people

US politics live – latest updates

South Korea's government has said it will launch an investigation into whether human rights violations were committed when hundreds of its citizens were detained in a US immigration raid.

About 475 people, mostly South Korean nationals, were arrested at the construction site of an electric vehicle battery factory in the US state of Georgia on 4 September.

The raid was the largest single-site operation conducted since the US president, Donald Trump, launched a sweeping immigration crackdown. Images of the workers chained and handcuffed shocked South Korea, prompting a stern rebuke from Seoul.

After delicate diplomatic negotiations, the detained South Korean workers were released and flown back to Seoul. Some of the workers told local media about appalling conditions during their arrest, including allegations they were held without being informed of their rights.

When asked about those allegations, the presidential office in Seoul said it was conducting a “thorough review”.

“Both our side and the US are checking if there were any shortcomings in the measures taken and companies are also looking into it,” the presidential spokesperson Kang Yu-jung told a press briefing. “Together with the company concerned, we are conducting a more thorough review into possible human rights infringements.”

One of the workers told Yonhap News Agency that their rights were not read when they were arrested. The worker also told the agency they were angry that Ice agents mocked them with remarks about “North Korea” and “rocket man” – an insult Trump has previously used about Pyongyang's leader, Kim Jong-un.

South Korea's president, Lee Jae Myung, called the raid “bewildering” and noted it could have a chilling effect on future investment. South Korean companies “can't help but question whether setting up a plant in the US is worth the potential risks”, Lee said.

In what seemed to be a response, Trump said on Sunday that foreign workers were “welcome” and he did not want to scare investors.

“I don't want to frighten off or disincentivize investment,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Tesla shares rose by more than 8% after news of CEO's transactions, a week after he was offered $1tn pay package

Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO, has purchased nearly $1bn worth of the electric-vehicle maker's stock, a regulatory filing showed, reinforcing Musk's push for greater control over Tesla.

Tesla shares jumped more than 8% in premarket trading on Monday following the news.

Tesla is racing to meet its ambitious targets on robotaxis, artificial intelligence and robotics as it looks to pivot from an EV maker to a tech leader. As of December, Musk held a roughly 13% stake, according to LSEG data.

Musk disclosed buying 2.57m shares in open-market transactions on Friday, paying between $372.37 and $396.54 per share, according to the filing.

Tesla shares jumped more than 7% on Friday, extending solid gains from the previous session. The stock, which is down about 2% this year, is on track to record a third straight session of gains if premarket moves are sustained.

Musk has consistently demanded a bigger stake and increased voting power at Tesla, having also threatened to build AI and robotics products outside of Tesla if he cannot get 25% voting power.

Earlier this month, Tesla's board proposed a trillion-dollar compensation plan for Musk, in a huge vote of confidence for Musk's leadership from the board, even as the company stumbles amid heated competition and flailing EV demand.

On Friday, board chair Robyn Denholm dismissed concerns that Musk's political activity had hurt sales and said the billionaire was back “front and center” at the company after several months at the White House.

Musk's political activity and public clashes with Donald Trump had stirred worries among investors about distractions and potential lost sales, weighing on the company's stock this year.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Starlink, the satellite internet service owned by Elon Musk, suffered a global outage on Sept. 15, the company announced on its official website.

The service has become vital for hospitals, schools, and front-line military units across Ukraine.

""Starlink is once again down across the entire front line,"" Ukraine's top drone warfare commander, Robert ""Madyar"" Brovdi, wrote on Telegram.

Downdetector, a platform that tracks service outages, reported tens of thousands of user complaints worldwide. The company said it was investigating the cause.

Nearly an hour later, Brovdi reported that connectivity was beginning to ""gradually restore,"" though Starlink has not officially confirmed a full recovery. Downdetector also shows a decline in outage reports.

This marks the second major Starlink outage in recent months.

The stakes are high for Ukraine, as Starlink has replaced much of the country's destroyed communications infrastructure and supports both civilian and military connectivity.

Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, Kyiv has received over 50,000 Starlink terminals, with Poland providing nearly 30,000, the largest contribution by any single country.

Ukraine's reliance on Starlink has previously been complicated by tensions with Musk. 

Reuters reported in July 2023 that the billionaire ordered a temporary deactivation of satellite coverage over Kherson Oblast during a Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2022, sparking concerns about the vulnerability of critical systems to private decision-making.

Global oil prices rose on Sept. 15 as Ukrainian drone strikes continued to hit Russian oil refineries throughout the past week, Reuters reported. 

Brent crude futures climbed 0.5% to $67.35 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude increased 0.6% to $63.05. Both benchmarks gained over 1% last week amid Kyiv's intensified campaign against Russia's energy infrastructure.

Over the past week, Ukrainian forces struck multiple Russian energy facilities, including the Ilsky refinery in Krasnodar Krai, Russia's largest oil-loading port on the Baltic Sea, a major refinery in Bashkortostan, and the Kirishi refinery in Leningrad Oblast. 

Kirishi, one of Russia's largest refineries, processes more than 17 million tons of crude annually.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 14 that Ukraine's strikes on oil facilities amount to the ""most effective sanctions,"" weakening Russia's ability to finance its war. 

""They have significantly curbed the Russian oil industry, which curbs the war,"" he said.

Oil exports constitute about one-third of Russia's federal budget, making them a critical source of funding for the war in Ukraine.

U.S. President Donald Trump has tied Russia's declining oil revenues to his peace efforts, warning that reduced income could pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war. 

The U.S. has tried to pressure Moscow's allies by imposing tariffs on countries purchasing Russian oil.

India, one of Russia's top oil customers, temporarily paused imports after Trump imposed a 25% tariff on Aug. 1, followed by an additional 25% duty on Aug. 27. U.S. officials have also warned of similar actions against Chinese exports if Beijing continues oil trade with Moscow.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on Sept. 8 that European countries must end Russian oil and gas imports if they expect Washington to escalate sanctions further.

By providing military assistance to Ukraine, NATO countries are ""at war"" with Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian journalists during a Sept. 15 briefing. 

""NATO is at war with Russia; this is obvious and needs no proof. NATO provides direct and indirect support to the Kyiv regime,"" Peskov said, repeating Moscow's narrative that Western backing for Ukraine equals participation in the war.

The remarks came just days after Poland confirmed it had shot down Russian drones in its airspace, the first known case of a NATO member downing Moscow's military assets over its own territory. 

The statement also resembles Russian disinformation narratives identified by Polish analysts that surged after the drone incursion, including a claim that the incident drew Warsaw into a war with Moscow.

The Kremlin's claim that NATO is ""at war"" with Moscow closely mirrors Russian disinformation narratives that flooded the Polish information space shortly after the incursion.

A disinformation analysis center by NASK, Poland's national research institute, has reported an increased disinformation activity among Russian and Belarusian sources shortly after the incident.

One of the narratives listed by Polish researchers is that the incursion means Poland is effectively at war with Russia — a false claim that could ""cause panic among the public,"" NASK warns.

Poland and other NATO members are not combatants in the Russia-Ukraine war but have supplied Kyiv with weapons, training, and financial aid to support its right to self-defense against Russia's full-scale invasion. The only country waging war in Ukraine is Russia.

Russian disinformation narratives identified by NASK are often contradictory, ranging from denying the incident altogether to blaming Ukraine, claiming Kyiv seeks to draw Poland and NATO into an open war with Russia.

Other claims depict the Polish military as incapable of defending the country's airspace or connect the incident to recent tensions between Poland's Presidential Office and Ukraine.

The campaign's chief goal is to ""shift the responsibility for violating Polish airspace onto Ukraine and to discredit the actions taken by the Polish military and security services,"" NASK said.

Res Futura, a Polish NGO, also said the incursion was followed by an organized psychological operation (PSYOP) aimed at ""escalating emotions, polarizing public opinion,"" and undermining trust in the Polish state and its allies.

The NGO's social media analysis revealed a high frequency of repetitive narratives in the Polish social media space, a feature typical of a coordinated operation rather than genuine public reactions.

As a result, the narrative portraying the incident as a ""Ukrainian provocation"" and a ""false flag"" operation was dominant among social media commentators (38%), followed by those blaming Russia (34%), according to the analysis.

""The drone attack was used not only as a military incident, but above all as a tool of psychological warfare,"" Res Futura's report read.

""Poland has been drawn into the next phase of a hybrid conflict, in which the main battlefield is the information space.""

The Sept. 10 incident was not the only Russian violation of NATO airspace in the past few days.

Romania also scrambled F-16 fighter jets on Sept. 13 after detecting a drone crossing into its airspace during a Russian strike near the Ukrainian border. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the drone entered Romanian territory for nearly an hour.

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas described the incident as a ""reckless escalation.""

Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski told the Kyiv Independent that the idea of closing part of Ukraine's airspace with NATO-stationed defenses could be revived after the attacks. 

Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, known for incendiary rhetoric, warned that any NATO move to enforce a no-fly zone would mean ""war between NATO and Russia.""

Polish officials reported that 21 Russian drones violated the country's airspace during the Sept. 10 strike, with four intercepted. Warsaw has since triggered NATO's Article 4, which allows consultations when a member believes its security is threatened.

NATO has also launched its Eastern Sentry mission following the incident.

The Associated Press

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he didn't rule out further strikes on Hamas leaders “wherever they are” as the heads of Arab and Islamic states held a summit to show support for Qatar after Israel's attack on the Gulf state last week.

The September 9 strike targeting leaders of the Palestinian militant group in Doha marked a significant escalation of Israeli military action in a region shaken by conflict since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attacks that ignited the Gaza war.

While the assembled Arab and Muslim leaders were expressing solidarity with Qatar, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Netanyahu and gave strong backing for Israel's hardline stance, although Washington has expressed unease over the Qatar strike.

Latest updates on Gaza City, Israel's offensive, ceasefire talks and the Palestinian famine

Speaking alongside Netanyahu in Israel, Rubio said the only way to end the war in Gaza would be for Hamas fighters to free all hostages and surrender. While the U.S. wants a diplomatic end to the war, “we have to be prepared for the possibility that's not going to happen,” he said.

Washington has said it was not warned in advance before Israel attacked Qatar, which houses the biggest U.S. military base in the Middle East. President Donald Trump said on Sunday Israel had to be “very, very careful”.

“They have to do something about Hamas, but Qatar has been a great ally to the United States,” Trump said.

Hamas has said the Israeli strike on Qatar killed five of its members, including a son of its exiled Gaza chief, but its leadership survived. Qatar says one of its security agents also died.

Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, addressing the emergency summit, urged “practical and decisive steps” in response to the “cowardly and treacherous” Israeli strike. He said the attack occurred as Hamas leaders were studying a U.S. ceasefire proposal.

With a broad spectrum of states attending, including Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, it wasn't immediately clear what measures might be agreed at the summit. A statement was expected to say that the Israeli attack and other “hostile acts” threaten coexistence and efforts to normalise ties in the region, according to a draft seen by Reuters.

President Masoud Pezeshkian of Iran, which backs Hamas and fought a 12-day war with Israel in June, said “no Arab or Islamic country is safe from the attacks of the Zionist regime [Israel] and we have no choice but to unite our ranks”.

President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi of Egypt, a U.S. ally which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, said Israel's actions “put obstacles in the way of any opportunities for any new peace agreements and even aborts existing ones”.

Rubio will travel to Qatar after his visit to Israel. He called on Qatar to continue to play a constructive role in resolving the Gaza conflict, saying it could help reach the goals of releasing all 48 hostages still held in Gaza, disarming Hamas and building a better future for Gazans.

But his words alongside Netanyahu suggested Washington now considers a diplomatic solution unlikely and is backing Israel's plan for a major new military operation that Netanyahu says will crush Hamas once and for all.

“As much as we may wish that there be a peaceful, diplomatic way to end it, and we'll continue to explore and be dedicated to it, we also have to be prepared for the possibility that's not going to happen,” said Rubio, calling Hamas “savage terrorists”.

Opinion: Israel's Qatar bombing didn't kill its intended targets, but it killed hopes for a Gaza ceasefire

“Hamas needs to cease to exist as an armed element that can threaten the peace and security of the region,” he said.

With Rubio at his side, Netanyahu did not rule out annexing the Israeli-occupied West Bank in response to moves by some countries to recognize a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly later this month. France and Britain are among the countries that have said they will do so.

Asked if Israel was considering extending its sovereignty to the West Bank, Netanyahu said: “A future step is a future step. We don't need to expose it ahead of time”.

“It's clear that taking unilateral actions against us simply invites unilateral actions on our part,” he said.

While diplomacy was unfolding in Jerusalem and Doha, Israeli forces were continuing their assault on Gaza City, where they killed at least 16 Palestinians in strikes on two homes and on a tent housing a displaced family, local health authorities said.

The army also hit and destroyed a 16-floor building in the west of the city, believed to be the tallest in the Gaza Strip, about an hour after warning displaced families sheltering inside and nearby to leave. It said the building was being used to hide “terrorist infrastructure.”

The war in Gaza was triggered by a rampage into southern Israel by Hamas militants who killed around 1,200 people and captured 251 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel responded with an assault that has killed more than 64,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities.

Windsor Castle staff are setting the 50-metre-long mahogany table. Grooms are buffing the hooves of the horses that will pull the royal carriages. And the military honour guard is drilling to ensure every step lands with precision.

Throughout the halls and grounds of the almost 1,000-year-old castle west of London, hundreds of people are working to make sure King Charles III puts on the best show possible when he welcomes U.S. President Donald Trump for his historic second state visit this week.

The visit, featuring glittering tiaras, brass bands and a sumptuous banquet served on 200-year-old silver, is a display of the pomp and ceremony that Britain does like no one else. But it's a spectacle with a purpose: to bolster ties with one of the world's most powerful men at a time when his America First policies are roiling longstanding trade and security relationships.

“We're buttering up to him,” said Robert Lacey, a royal historian and consultant on the Netflix series The Crown.

“He wouldn't come to Britain if he wouldn't have the chance to stay at Windsor Castle, probably pay homage to the [late] queen he admires so much, and to meet the king.”

Maybe it was nerves from being in the presence of royalty, or perhaps it was a simple mistake, but over the years there have been quite a few gaffes between U.S. presidents, first ladies and members of the British Royal family.

The Associated Press

Three centuries after Britain's kings and queens gave up political power and settled for the role of ceremonial head of state, the royals remain a robust instrument of “soft power,” which the elected government uses to reward friends and wring concessions out of reluctant allies.

State visits are the monarchy's ultimate tool, with world leaders vying to get the full royal treatment.

During seven decades on the throne, the late Queen Elizabeth II hosted everyone from Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu to South African President Nelson Mandela.

The royals have also hosted the last four U.S. presidents, though not all were full-scale state visits.

While the impact of soft power is hard to quantify, it contributes to a feeling of friendship that “may incline another party to be more open to your entreaties,” said Martin Farr, an expert in modern British history at Newcastle University.

Six years ago, Britain sought Trump's support as it prepared to leave the European Union. This time the U.K. is lobbying for favourable trade terms and help in combating Russian aggression in Ukraine.

“A new Trump presidency, a new prime minister, a different government, but the same sense of panic and the same feeling that the biggest lever we can pull with this president is to flatter him and to try and connect him with something he seems genuinely to be impressed by, which is monarchy, and the fact that his mother of course was born” in Scotland, Farr said.

So Prime Minister Keir Starmer hurried to Washington in February, just five weeks after Trump began his second term, and handed him the king's invitation for a state visit.

It was the first time any world leader received the honour of a second state visit, and the first time the invitation was delivered in a personal letter from the king, which Trump proudly displayed for TV cameras.

“It's a great, great honor, and that says at Windsor,” Trump said as he praised the king. “That's really something.”

There will be plenty of glitz for a president who has gilded the Oval Office and plans to build a White House ballroom for 650 guests.

While the president and first lady Melania Trump will arrive in the U.K. late Tuesday, the meat of the visit begins the next day.

After welcoming the Trumps, Charles and Queen Camilla will accompany them on a carriage ride through the Windsor estate, then back to the castle along a path lined by members of the armed forces.

Inside the crenellated walls of the castle, which William the Conqueror started building in 1070, a military band will play the national anthems of both countries before Charles and Trump review the guard of honour in scarlet tunics and tall bearskin hats.

Hundreds of military personnel will take part in the ceremonies – mounted troops, foot guards and musicians – after months of rehearsals.

When rifles are shouldered, it will come with a single thwack. When boots hit the ground, they will do so in unison. “God Save the King” and “The Star-Spangled Banner” will be note-perfect.

After the welcoming ceremonies, the Trumps will view an exhibit of documents and artwork put together to highlight the shared history of Britain and the U.S. The palace hasn't said what will be included, but the options are myriad for two countries with common legal and democratic traditions that stretch back to Magna Carta, the historic charter of rights signed in 1215 at Runnymede, just a few miles from Windsor.

But the centrepiece of the visit will be Wednesday night's state banquet, where the men will don white ties and tail coats and the women will wear designer gowns and jewels that will sparkle in the flickering light from antique candelabra.

Prince Harry and King Charles III meet in London for first time in over a year

“The tiaras will be out in force,'' said Hugo Vickers, a royal historian and author of “Alice,'' a biography of the late Prince Philip's mother. “It will all look very splendid.''

The king and queen will join their guests around the massive Waterloo Table, which is about half the length of a football field and has space for 160 guests. It takes five full days to set the table, which will be laid with the Grand Service, a silver-gilt dining service that includes more than 4,000 pieces ranging from serving dishes to dinner plates and egg cups.

Vickers said the silver and ceremonies pave the way for conciliation, which Elizabeth believed was the way to solve even intractable problems.

“Keir Starmer has, cleverly in a way, used the king to lure President Trump over here, to give him a very good time,” he said. “And [it's] a wonderful opportunity, with all the goodwill that will be engaged at this point, to talk to him … and if there's any hope of sorting out Ukraine, etc. This is all a step in the right direction.”

Those discussions take place Thursday, when Trump and Starmer meet at Chequers, the country estate of British prime ministers.

Germany's interior minister has confirmed direct talks with Afghanistan's rulers to facilitate ""regular"" deportations. Follow for the latest from Germany.

Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt said German delegations have held ""technical discussions with Afghan representatives"" in Qatar, and would hold more meetings in coming weeks. 

Dobrindt said Germany was seeking to facilitate ""regular"" deportations to Afghanistan. 

The German government has long had no official diplomatic ties with the Taliban, the Islamist group that returned to power in Afghanistan after the 2021 NATO withdrawal.

The old synagogue on Munich's Reichenbachstrasse will be reopened on Monday after years of restoration.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Bavarian State Premier Markus Söder and Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter are expected to attend the ceremony in the evening.

Like many others across Germany, the synagogue was vandalized and set on fire by the Nazis during the pogroms that became known as Kristallnacht — the night of broken glass — on November 9, 1938.

By chance, the fire department managed to prevent the flames from spreading to nearby homes before the structure was completely destroyed.

After World War II, the synagogue underwent a rushed restoration, but it was never fully restored to its former condition.

German arms producer Rheinmetall has agreed to acquire Luerssen Group's warship division, NVL, as it eyes expansion in Europe.

Rheinmetall said both companies agreed not to disclose the purchase price for NVL. The businesses aim to complete the deal early next year, pending approval from antitrust officials.

Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger told investors that the deal valued NVL at roughly 4.5 times its mid-term core profit goal of €300 million, indicating a price of about €1.35 billion ($1.59 billion).

Papperger explained that the decision to enter the naval defense sector was driven by Russian aggression following Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which has prompted many European nations to boost their defense budgets.

Germany alone is expected to spend around €31 billion on naval vessels by 2035, according to Rheinmetall.

The German company is already Europe's biggest ammunition maker. Recently, the company and Romania signed a framework agreement to build a munitions ignition powder factory.

An older married couple from Wuppertal, west Germany, has recovered almost 3.5 kg (120 ounces) of gold they had lost to scammers earlier this year.

The gold, worth over $400,000 (€350,000), was found during a routine traffic stop in the west German region of Niedersachsen this July. One of the suspects allegedly posed as a family member of the couple, tricking them into giving them gold, jewelry and cash.

A joint team of customs officials and police officers conducted the investigation, making it possible to retrieve the gold and give it back to the victims, authorities said.

It could be pure coincidence, but the fact that the addiction care center in the western German city of Essen, population 600,000, is located on Hoffnungsstraße (""Hope Street"" ) could also be a sign. 

Hope for the people struggling with addiction, who find somewhere they can get a free meal and a place to sleep. Hope Street is also the place where they can snort, smoke or inject heroin in sterile drug consumption rooms, under supervision.

Since the drug consumption room opened in 2001, there has not been a single death there. But the latest, even more dangerous drugs are already on the doorstep.

Essen, along with Hanover and Berlin, is one of three model cities conscientiously preparing for a further increase in fentanyl. The project is called ""Synthetic Opioids — Prepare and Response,"" or ""so–par"" for short, and is set to serve as a blueprint for the whole country.

Emergency plans are being prepared, emergency services and hospital staff are being trained, and, above all, drug tests are being expanded to be able to detect opioids more precisely.

Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt is expected to propose to the Cabinet this week that the domestic intelligence service be led by Sinan Selen, who had been deputy president at the agency.

The 53-year-old would be the first person not born in Germany to lead the domestic spy agency. He was born in Turkey and emigrated to Germany with his family at a young age.

The agency is officially known as the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV). 

Earlier this year, the BfV upgraded its assessment of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party from suspected to confirmed right-wing extremist. It cited what it described as anti-constitutional and xenophobic efforts.

The classification meant that the agency could have greater powers to monitor the AfD's activities. However, the label was suspended pending a court decision after the AfD took legal action.

A report by Reuters news agency details the story of a 31-year-old Palestinian fleeing Gaza to Europe — via jet ski.

Muhammad Abu Dakha initially crossed the Rafah border point to Egypt in 2024, paying $5,000, according to the report, before going to China. 

But after failing to win asylum in China, Abu Dakha returned to Egypt and then went to Libya, where thousands are exploited by traffickers while trying to secure a spot on a boat to Europe.

He said he failed 10 crossing attempts with smugglers before deciding to buy a used Yamaha jet ski for about $5,000 on a Libyan online marketplace. He also spent $1,500 on equipment, including a GPS, a satellite phone and life jackets.

Abu Dakha then drove the jet ski with two other Palestinians on board for about 12 hours. 

According to the report, the trio used ChatGPT to calculate how much fuel they would need for the journey. They ended up running out 20 kilometers (12 miles) away from Lampedusa and called for help.  

Reuters cited a Frontex spokesperson as saying that a Romanian patrol boat for the EU's border agency picked them up, describing the circumstances as ""an unusual occurrence.""

Filippo Ungaro, spokesperson for UNHCR Italy, confirmed that authorities recorded their arrival in Italy after a jet ski journey from the Libyan port of al-Khoms and a rescue off Lampedusa.

Reuters said Abu Dakha contacted its journalists while staying in Lampedusa's migrant center after a member of the staff told him that local media had reported his arrival via jet ski.

He eventually made his way to Germany, where he said he applied for asylum and was waiting for a court to examine his application.

He has no job or income and is staying in a local center for asylum seekers, Reuters said. 

A 49-year-old German suspect in the case of the 2007 disappearance of a then-3-year-old British girl has refused to be interviewed by UK police, officials said. 

Madeleine McCann vanished in Portugal while on holiday with her family, sparking a frenzied search and gaining media attention around the world.

British and German police named Christian B. as a suspect in 2020. He had lived in Portugal's Algarve region at the time when McCann vanished.

German police had said McCann was assumed dead and that B. was likely responsible. He denied involvement and has not been charged with any crime related to the case.

B., a convicted child abuser and drug dealer, has been in prison for raping a 72-year-old woman in the same area of the Algarve.

He is due to be released from German prison this month, but he remains a suspect in the British police's investigation. 

Editor's note: DW follows the German press code, which refrains from revealing the full names of criminal suspects.

Police in the western town of Bitburg, near the border with Luxembourg, said two people were killed in a crash of a light aircraft. 

The aircraft had been scheduled to land at Bitburg airfield at around 8:30 p.m. local time on Sunday (1830 GMT). It  lost contact with the radar and was reported missing. 

Police and firefighters located the crashed plane and the bodies of the two passengers early in the morning in a field around 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) north of Bitburg.

Authorities are investigating the crash. 

The conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), Chancellor Friedrich Merz's party, emerged as the strongest party in North Rhine-Westphalia's municipal elections, while the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) made major gains.

The center-left Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens lost ground, according to preliminary results.

The CDU has around 33.3% of the overall votes, roughly matching its historically weak 34.3% result in 2020. The SPD came second with 22.5%, slightly down from 24.3% five years ago.

The AfD nearly tripled its vote share to 14.5% from 5.1% in 2020. The Greens suffered heavy losses, dropping to 11.5% after a record 20% in the last local election.

CDU and SPD politicians have vowed not to work with the AfD, maintaining the so-called firewall against the far-right party.

Nearly 14 million residents were eligible to vote in Germany's most populous state. The municipal vote was for local councils, mayors and district administrators among other elected positions.

According to public broadcaster WDR, voter turnout was 56.5%, nearly 5% higher than in the 2020 local elections.

German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has confirmed that talks are underway with the Taliban to deport Afghan nationals who were convicted of crimes from Germany. 

""We want to make deportations possible on our own. And that is why we are maintaining technical contacts between colleagues from the Interior Ministry and representatives from Afghanistan,"" he said. 

""And these technical contacts should ultimately lead to us being able to deport people to Afghanistan on a regular basis,"" Dobrindt added.

Separately, German Foreign Minister Wadephul Johann Wadephul also confirmed that talks about deportations were taking place in Doha — but signalled that he did not see meetings in Kabul as necessary.

In July, Germany flew 81 Afghans with criminal records and failed asylum claims to Afghanistan. 

The Taliban took over Afghanistan's government in August 2021 following the NATO withdrawal. Since then, Germany has not had official diplomatic ties with the Taliban government, which it did not recognize as legitimate.

Marcel Emmerich, the Green Party's domestic policy spokesman, has called it a scandal. 

""The public has a right to know what the terrorists are getting in return. Dobrindt is making himself dependent on an Islamist organization and is reducing security in the country,"" he told the Tagesspiegel newspaper. 

With the rise of the far right in Germany, migration was a central topic in the CSU and CDU's election campaign in the February general election.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz has vowed to deport people to Afghanistan and Syria, and suspend asylum admission programs for German agencies' former local staff in Afghanistan.

Today, the German parliament is holding more readings of the 2026 budget proposal. 

We are also expecting political parties to make statements after local elections in Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia.

Also, on Monday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz will be attending the reopening of a synagogue in Munich after years of restoration work.

US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping could finalize the deal on the Chinese-owned video platform TikTok in the coming days. 

The United States and China have reached a framework deal regarding TikTok, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday.

The agreement would allow the short-video sharing platform to continue operating in the United States.

""The framework is for a switch to US-controlled ownership,"" Bessent told reporters in Madrid.

He said US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were scheduled to speak on Friday to ""complete"" the agreement.

 China's Vice Minister of Commerce Li Chenggang confirmed the framework agreement. 

The video platform is immensely popular among young people across the world, including in the US.

The US Congress last year threatened a ban on TikTok unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, sold its controlling stake.

Lawmakers were concerned about how the company handles US-based user data amid open questions regarding Chinese government influence.

Trump has repeatedly extended the deadline for shutting down the popular app since returning to office in January.

In mid-June, he extended the deadline by 90 days, moving it to September 17, to allow time to find a non-Chinese buyer or face a ban in the United States.

US and Chinese officials meeting in Madrid to discuss a broader trade dispute have reached a framework deal to resolve it, Bessent said.

""The two sides reached a basic framework consensus on resolving issues related to TikTok through cooperation, reducing investment barriers and promoting relevant economic and trade cooperation, Li  was quoted as saying by Chinese state news agency Xinhua.

""China will firmly safeguard the national interests, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises,"" he added.

While the CDU is set for victory, the far-right AfD has tripled its share of voters in North Rhine-Westphalia since the last local elections in Germany's most populous state, early estimates show. DW has more.

As polls closed in the municipal vote across North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, initial forecasts showed the center-right party of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz set for victory — but the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) also has reasons to celebrate.

Merz's CDU is set to take around 34% of the vote, followed by center-left SPD, with 22.5%, and the far-right AfD, with 16.5% — over three times more than the 5.1% the party secured in 2020.

Sunday's polls were the first local elections since Chancellor Friedrich Merz took office in May.

The AfD has made historic gains in recent years, becoming the second-strongest political force at the national level. 

Although its voter base is mainly from states in eastern Germany, the AfD is hoping to capitalize on the shift toward the right in western Germany.

This blog has now closed. Below you can read DW's coverage of the local election in North Rhine-Westphalia and other news from Germany on Sunday, September 14: 
 

North Rhine-Westphalia state premier Hendrik Wüst of the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party called his state ""the powerhouse of the CDU.""

Wüst wrote on X after initial projections on Sunday evening showed that his party is set for victory in Germany's most populous state.

The result also demonstrates that the center-right party in North Rhine-Westphalia is ""the pacesetter for strong election results for the CDU throughout Germany,"" Wüst said. 

Bärbel Bas, the co-chairperson of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), said she is disappointed at her party's showing in local elections in North Rhine-Westphalia on Sunday. 

Bas, who is also the federal Labor Minister, acknowledged to regional public broadcaster WDR that the party was unable to ""stop the downward trend.""

""The results do not make me happy, of course,"" she added.

The SPD is projected to finish second, with around 22% of the vote.

However, Bas insisted that the outcome is not the disaster for the SPD that had been predicted ahead of the vote.

""We must, of course, ask ourselves how we can get out of this slump,"" said Bas, who added that the performance of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) should be a concern for all democratic parties.

The SPD has struggled at the ballot box recently. February's federal election was the party's worst result since 1887.

Germany's men's basketball team won its second ever European title after defeating Turkey in the EuroBasket 2025 final in Riga on Sunday night.

The reigning world champions beat the Turks 88-83 thanks to a strong showing from NBA star Dennis Schröder, who was named the MVP of the tournament.

Read more about how Germany won their first EuroBasket title since 1993.

Who is German — and what exactly makes someone German? Germans have been arguing about these issues for centuries.

The constitution, called the Basic Law, is clear: a German is anyone with a German passport. 

Citizenship cannot be revoked, and discriminating against citizens on the basis of their religion, origin or language violates the Basic Law's fundamental values.

This is one of the lessons learned from the Nazi regime's reign of terror from 1933 to 1945, which systematically disenfranchised, terrorized and murdered Germany's Jewish population in particular. Sinti and Roma, homosexuals, disabled people and political opponents, among others, were also targeted and were denied their German identity.

Nearly all of the ripe grapes have been stolen from two vineyards covering an area of around 8,000 square meters in the western state of Rhineland-Palatinate .

The theft is estimated to cost two independent winemakers in the village of Gundheim ""several thousand euros,"" police said in a statement.

The village is near the city of Worms, which is about 60 kilometers (37 miles) south of Germany's financial capital Frankfurt am Main.

The grape varieties affected are Riesling and Sauvignon blanc.

Authorities said the alleged perpetrators had ""acted professionally and with considerable logistical effort.""

""Due to the amount of stolen goods, it must be assumed that at least one larger vehicle or several means of transport were used,"" police said.

Anyone witnessing suspicious people or vehicles near the vineyards between September 6 and Sunday has been asked to contact the police.

Tino Chrupalla, the co-leader of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) with Alice Weidel, hailed the initial forecasts, which predict that his far-right party has more than tripled its share of votes in the local elections in North Rhine-Westphalia. 

""We are a major party and we all bear a great responsibility for Germany,"" he posted on X.

The outcome of North Rhine-Westphalia's local elections gives the federal ruling coalition a lift, according to CDU parliamentary leader Jens Spahn. The coalition led by Friedrich Merz consists of the conservative CDU/CSU block and the center-left SPD.

""The strong result in NRW is the reward for good local work and gives the coalition in Berlin a tailwind,"" said the native of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW).

Spahn described the outcome of the municipal vote as motivation for ""calm, pragmatic work,"" which he said voters clearly value. But he warned that the surge of the far right, illustrated by the increasing support for the AfD, must be a wake-up call. According to the lawmaker, this shows that issues like poverty-driven migration, welfare abuse and failed integration ""must not be taboo"" and require concrete action.

Following the Sunday vote in Germany's NRW state, projections indicate the CDU will secure 34.2% support, roughly matching its historically poor 34.3% in 2020. The SPD followed with 22.6%, down 1.7 points. The AfD more than tripled its 2020 result, reaching 16.4%.

Following the NRW vote, the Green Party is due to win 11.7% of the vote — a massive drop compared to 20% they won in the 2020 municipal election.

On Sunday, the Greens federal co-chair Felix Banaszak said the party would have to wait and see ""where we end up.""

He described the poor result as a sign of the current mood, saying ecological and progressive politics are facing headwinds, not only in Germany but elsewhere.

Banaszak said the Greens are in a difficult position that is partly of their own making.

He also acknowledged mistakes made by the previous ruling coalition led by former Chancellor Olaf Scholz, which also included the Green Party.

Banaszak said a party does not lose eight percentage points ""if it did everything right.""

An elderly man collapsed and died at a polling station in the city of Krefeld, northwest of the NRW state capital Düsseldorf.

The polling station was set up inside a retirement home, but the man was not one of the facility's residents. A spokesman for the city said the man had come to vote with his wife in the afternoon.

Someone at the polling station tried to resuscitate him on site, but their efforts were not successful.

Initial findings show that the elderly man had a pre-existing medical condition, according to the Rheinische Post newspaper.

The conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) emerged as the strongest party in North Rhine-Westphalia's municipal elections, while the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) made major gains.

The center-left Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens lost ground, according to a forecast by public broadcaster WDR.

The CDU took 34%, roughly matching its historically weak 34.3% result in 2020. The SPD came second with 22.5%, slightly down from 24.3% five years ago.

The AfD more than tripled its vote share to 16.5% from 5.1% in 2020. The Greens suffered heavy losses, dropping to 11.5% after a record 20% in the last local election.

The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) hopes to gain ground in today's regional election in North Rhine-Westphalia — with the outcome also seen as a litmus test for the federal government led by moderate conservative Friedrich Merz.

Chancellor Merz is backed by the ruling coalition comprised of his own Christian Democrats (CDU), the Bavaria-based conservative CSU, and center-left Social Democrats (SDP). 

The CDU is expected to lose some seats to the AfD in the regional election, but the SDP  — already a junior partner in Merz's government — is likely to suffer much heavier loses. The SPD faces an especially tough battle in the cities such as Gelsenkirchen or Duisburg in the Ruhr area, once a beating heart of Germany's industry.

Political scientist Oliver Lembcke points out that the AfD connects housing shortages, high rents or bad schools with immigration. 

Subsequently, strong results for the AfD could amp up pressure on the governing coalition in Berlin, especially when it comes to questions of immigration, internal security and other social issues.

An intoxicated man, scaled a 50-meter (165-foot) church roof in the southern city of Landshut, in order to take a picture on his mobile phone, the German news agency DPA reported, citing police.

His actions prompted a large emergency response, during which he was rescued with a turntable ladder, police said.

According to a police report, the 24-year-old managed to climb over scaffolding before making his way on the the nave of St Martin's Church on Saturday evening.

He then climbed onto the 50-meter high ridge, sat down and took a photo of the  view.

He suffered minor scrapes but now faces charges of trespassing and causing damage to property and he will also have to foot the bill of the rescue operation, police said.

The death of seven candidates from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) during the election campaign provoked much online speculation, and even drew comment from the party's billionaire sympathizer, Elon Musk, who called the deaths ""weird.""

Although it was the highest number of deaths in any party in the run-up to Sunday's elections, nine candidates from other parties also passed away in the preelection period, according to official data.

A spokesman for the state of North Rhine-Westphalia's election commissioner told the DPA news agency that the number of deaths among candidates was ""not significantly higher"" than in previous campaigns.

Nonetheless, party co-leader Alice Weidel seemed to condone conspiracy theories about the deaths by reposting an article by retired economist Stefan Homburg stating that the number of AfD candidates' deaths was ""statistically almost impossible.""

But Martin Vincentz, the leader of the AfD's chapter in the state, backed police in saying that no evidence of foul play had emerged. 

He did suggest, however, that the speculation about possible criminal causes of death reflected ""the often ruthless battle that has been waged against the AfD for years"" by German authorities.

The party, the strongest opposition group in Germany's parliament, is under investigation by domestic intelligence services as a ""suspected"" case of right-wing extremism at the national level. 

Local elections in North Rhine-Westphalia take place every five years. There are about 13.7 million eligible voters, who will be choosing city and municipal councils, county councils, mayors and district administrators in altogether 427 municipalities.

Voters will be choosing among 20,000 candidates representing all the five main parties, as well as groupings that operate only at a regional or municipal level and independents.

Candidates are being put forward, though not in all municipalities, by Chancellor Friedrich Merz's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), his junior coalition partners the center-left Social Democrats, the socialist Left Party, the pro-environment Green Party, the business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) and the far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD).

The mayors of the state capital, Düsseldorf, and North Rhine-Westphalia's most-populous city, Cologne, will be among the posts determined by the results of the election.

The local elections are seen as a barometer of political sentiment in Germany, with the anti-immigrant AfD under particular scrutiny.

Germany is having a nationwide Day of Open Monuments on Sunday that will see 6,000 monuments open to the public.

The German Foundation for Monument Protection says visitors will be able to visit a wide range of sites, from historic homes and brewery cellars to church towers, factories and bunkers.

""You owe these experiences and private insights to almost 10,000 people who decided that their favorite places were a must-see,"" said chair of the German Foundation for Monument Protection, Steffen Skudelny.

""As monument conservationists, your hosts are proud to have prepared the buildings for the present and the future. You should accept such an invitation!"" Skudelny said.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

 Washington Still Has Significant Leverage Over China, North Korea, and Russia 

 Patricia M. Kim

No moment captured the shifting global balance of power more vividly than when Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un walked in lockstep on the red carpet at China's military parade in early September. The three autocrats, despite a long history of mutual suspicion, projected a show of unity against Washington. The message behind the carefully managed scene was unmistakable: China is at the center of a rising anti-Western bloc, while the United States is adrift—divided at home, faltering abroad, and rebuffed by its rivals.

U.S. President Donald Trump has made no secret of what he wants from each of the three leaders: a peace deal with Putin to end the war in Ukraine, a trade pact with Xi to rebalance the U.S.-Chinese economic relationship, and a summit with Kim to revive stalled diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula. But all three have spurned his overtures. Instead of engaging on Washington's terms, Kim, Putin, and Xi are now linking arms in Beijing, flaunting not only their growing willingness to challenge U.S. leadership but also their ability to do so in concert.

But beneath this show of solidarity, China, North Korea, and Russia remain uneasy partners. What the three countries have is a tactical alignment rooted not in trust or shared values but in overlapping grievances and necessity. History demonstrates that they are not natural allies. Each state remains wary of entrapment and is unwilling to subordinate its national interests to those of the others. And crucially, each still seeks something from the United States—leverage that Washington must wield wisely.

The last time China, North Korea, and Russia aligned this closely was during the Korean War, which ended badly for all. Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of the current North Korean leader, invaded South Korea with Soviet and Chinese support. The gamble failed. North Korea became the isolated, impoverished pariah state it is today, while its southern rival, backed by the United States, flourished. For China, the intervention was costly, in both blood and treasure. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese soldiers were killed or wounded, and scarce resources were drained from its economy, which was already battered by years of civil war and World War II. Worse, the war entrenched a permanent U.S. military presence on its doorstep and upended Beijing's plans for Taiwan. Fearing a broader communist advance, the Truman administration reversed its hands-off approach and signed a mutual defense treaty with Taipei, indefinitely forestalling China's goal of annexing the island, which remains unfinished business for China's leaders to this day. For Beijing, the Korean War offered a sobering lesson: aligning with volatile partners, such as Pyongyang, out of ideological solidarity can incur enormous costs and generate long-term liabilities.

The Korean War also sowed lasting distrust between China, North Korea, and Russia. Pyongyang believed that Beijing had prioritized its own interests during the Panmunjom armistice talks, sidelining North Korea's concerns. In the years that followed, North Korea resented what it saw as persistent Chinese interference and overreach. Kim Il Sung purged pro-Chinese figures from his country's leadership, just as Kim Jong Un would do decades later when he executed his uncle Jang Song Thaek, known for having close ties to Beijing. Meanwhile, Beijing bristled at Moscow's tepid support during the conflict. This added to a growing list of grievances that would culminate in the Sino-Soviet split, which began to take shape by the mid-1950s.

These fractures deepened over time. North Korea, ever transactional, learned to play Moscow and Beijing against each other, extracting aid and concessions from both countries while refusing to subordinate itself to either. China and the Soviet Union, once comrades in arms, descended into an intense ideological and geopolitical rivalry. For China, fears of Soviet encroachment loomed large. In 1961, just days after Moscow signed a mutual defense treaty with Pyongyang, China inked its own pact with North Korea, despite its bitter lessons from the Korean War. That treaty remains China's only formal alliance to date. Two decades later, similar fears drove China's 1979 invasion of Vietnam, its last major war. By resorting to force, Beijing hoped to counter what it saw as Moscow-backed Vietnamese expansionism and Soviet encirclement in Southeast Asia. The throughline is clear: mutual suspicion, not solidarity, has historically defined relations among this trio.

Today, more than 30 years after the end of the Cold War, the three countries have found common cause again in seeking to erode Washington's power and influence. But the carefully choreographed display of unity masks old divisions and simmering distrust. Unlike Pyongyang and Moscow, Beijing seeks to reshape the global order without setting it ablaze. It aims to weaken U.S. influence without fully severing its profitable ties with the West. China has extended Moscow a critical economic lifeline and supplied dual-use goods that have helped sustain the Kremlin's war in Ukraine. But it has done so because the costs have been manageable, limited to reputational damage among Western states. Crucially, the war between Russia and Ukraine has not yet posed a direct threat to China's own security or economic stability. If that changed, Beijing's calculus could shift quickly.

The cracks in the Chinese-Russian relationship are especially evident on the Korean Peninsula. China is deeply uneasy about Russia's expanding ties with North Korea. Moscow has turned to Pyongyang for munitions and troops to sustain its war in Ukraine and the two countries have signed a mutual defense pact. Putin has now eclipsed Xi as Kim's most important partner—frustrating Beijing's effort to be the dominant player on the Korean Peninsula. Over the past two years, Russia has added to China's concerns by transferring sensitive military technology, including air defense missile systems and drone capabilities, to North Korea. In private, Chinese analysts express concerns about the limited visibility over these transfers and their destabilizing potential.



What Beijing fears is a lack of control. In flash points such as the Taiwan Strait or the South China Sea, China can calibrate the pace of escalation. But North Korean adventurism, backed by Russia, could create volatility on China's doorstep that it cannot easily manage. As in the Korean War, China risks being dragged into a crisis by a reckless junior partner supported by Moscow. Russia, for its part, is less concerned about the consequences of instability in Asia. Putin's focus is squarely on reasserting Russian influence in eastern Europe. Should tensions escalate on the Korean Peninsula or in the Taiwan Strait, it is far from certain that Moscow would be willing to shoulder serious costs to support either of its partners.

Indeed, a deeper rivalry between Moscow and Beijing lingers beneath the surface. In June, for example, The New York Times reported that Russia's domestic intelligence agency refers to China as “the enemy” and worries about Chinese espionage. Within Russia, there are persistent fears that Beijing harbors long-term ambitions in Siberia and the Russian Far East. Moscow is anxious, in part, because Chinese investment and workers have flooded into these areas in recent years and because China published official maps in 2023 that used historical Chinese names for several Russian regions and cities.

Of the three leaders, Kim Jong Un has the most potential to exploit the trilateral relationship. Pyongyang has long perfected the art of leveraging great-power competition to extract concessions and preserve its autonomy. Today, Kim is simultaneously capitalizing on his ties with Moscow and reengaging Beijing to ensure he doesn't become too reliant on either patron. Attending the military parade with Xi, the first time the two leaders have met face-to-face since 2019, is part of a calculated recalibration. Kim reaffirmed his ties with China while keeping Russia close, strengthening his position to demand greater concessions from Washington in any future round of diplomacy. In this triangle, each country is hedging as much as aligning—pursuing its own interests under the guise of unity, yet prepared to shift course if either relationship becomes a liability.

The uneasy convergence of China, North Korea, and Russia may not give the United States a sweeping strategic opening, but it still leaves Washington room to maneuver if it engages each adversary with purpose and discipline. The United States still holds meaningful leverage with China because Beijing seeks economic stability. It wants to avoid any direct confrontation with the United States that would jeopardize its rise. Beijing also shares, at least in principle, several U.S. objectives: preserving regional stability, preventing a nuclear cascade in northeast Asia, and witnessing a peaceful resolution to the war in Ukraine. Chinese officials have repeatedly emphasized their support for cease-fire negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, portraying dialogue as the only way to resolve the conflict.

But overlapping interests alone are insufficient to spur cooperation. If Washington wants to translate these shared goals into tangible outcomes, it must proceed deliberately. The United States should make clear that progress on a trade deal and a possible Trump-Xi summit are contingent on China demonstrating its willingness to cooperate on areas of mutual concern—particularly curbing North Korea's unchecked nuclear and missile expansion and ending the war in Ukraine.

The United States does not need to engineer a split between China and Russia, nor could it anytime soon. Beijing will resist overt pressure to publicly break ranks with Moscow or Pyongyang. But private pressure might work to sway China, especially when its larger priorities are on the line. Despite its defiant tone, Beijing still seeks a trade deal with Washington that lowers tariffs and preserves a degree of stability in the U.S.-Chinese relationship. Failure to secure a deal may not be catastrophic for China's economy. But it would add unwanted volatility, compounding existing economic strains and increasing discontent among the Chinese public. By raising the stakes and conditioning Chinese cooperation on Ukraine and North Korea as integral to a broader bilateral agreement, Washington could force Beijing to make modest but meaningful adjustments, such as slowing purchases of Russian oil, curbing dual-use exports to Moscow, and signaling to Pyongyang that denuclearization must remain a long-term goal.



With Russia, Putin has shown little interest in peace talks that would require him to abandon his maximalist demands in Ukraine. He remains committed to outlasting U.S. and European support for Ukraine. But over time, Russia will need an off-ramp as troop losses mount, economic strains deepen, and public fatigue grows. Neither China nor North Korea can give Putin the diplomatic exit he needs. Only Ukraine and its partners can. Washington should not rush into negotiations; rather, it should use this leverage to carefully shape the conditions for a just and sustainable resolution to the war. The United States should coordinate with European allies to enhance Ukraine's capacity for self-defense, provide credible security guarantees, and apply mounting economic pressure on Moscow. A key part of that strategy must involve pressuring China and India to scale back their support for Russia's wartime economy—not through public ultimatums, which often provoke defiance, but through forceful backchannel diplomacy—allowing Beijing and New Delhi to change course without appearing to capitulate to U.S. pressure.

And with North Korea, the United States has bargaining power. Kim wants sanctions relief, regime security, and recognition of North Korea as legitimate nuclear power. There is a limit to how much China and Russia can deliver on these without U.S. cooperation. Despite its anti-American rhetoric, Pyongyang has long pursued a peace deal and normalization with Washington—not just for direct gains, but also because such a breakthrough would unlock broader engagement and economic assistance from Tokyo, Seoul, and beyond. This leverage shouldn't be squandered in pursuit of a quick Trump-Kim photo op. A workable deal could start with reaffirming the joint statement, signed by Trump and Kim, from the 2018 Singapore summit, which included a clear commitment to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. It could be accompanied by interim steps to reduce nuclear risks and expand diplomatic, economic, and humanitarian exchange with North Korea.

The red carpet moment in Beijing was meant to unsettle Washington—and it should. It underscored how far the United States' rivals have come in teaming up, even if their interests do not completely align. Yet China, Russia, and North Korea each still have reasons to deal with the United States. If Washington can resist the urge for improvised, optics-driven diplomacy; recognize its sources of leverage; and lean into its comparative strengths—its alliances, military power, economic influence, and diplomatic reach—it can shape the strategic environment instead of just reacting to it.

 Trump Should Learn the Right Lessons of the “War on Terror”

 Ryan C. Berg, Daniel Byman, Iselin Brady, Riley McCabe, Alexander Palmer, and Henry Ziemer

Since returning to the White House, U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged to defeat the Western Hemisphere's violent drug traffickers by any means necessary. In a March address to Congress, Trump declared, “The cartels are waging war in America, and it's time for America to wage war on the cartels.” Over the last several months, his administration has designated 13 cartels and criminal groups, including six based in Mexico and two in Venezuela, as foreign terrorist organizations. It has also surged troops to the U.S.-Mexican border, declared several tracts of land near the border to be military zones, directed the Central Intelligence Agency to step up reconnaissance drone missions over Mexico, and ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to draw up plans to assess potential collateral damage from airstrikes in Mexico.

Washington has left behind its traditional conception of the fight against transnational criminal organizations as a matter of law enforcement with its threats of “war” and consideration of military action against the cartels. In July, Trump directed the Department of Defense to prepare such plans. Then, in September, the U.S. military struck what administration officials claimed was a vessel used by members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to smuggle drugs, killing 11. Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the strikes on the basis that the U.S. president has the authority “under exigent circumstances to eliminate imminent threats to the United States.”

A militarized approach may be a politically attractive way for Trump to project strength. And indeed, the United States can, and should, draw on many valuable lessons from the last two decades of counterterrorism missions during the “war on terror” in its campaign against the cartels. But there is a more productive path forward than drastically shifting the rules of engagement with transnational criminal groups. In Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Washington may have a genuine partner in containing the cartels that pose the most direct threat to the United States. More extensive border measures, increased bilateral security coordination, and more frequent (but not more lethal) maritime interdiction efforts can accomplish just as much as unilateral U.S. military interventions using drones and special operations forces would, all while limiting risk to U.S. personnel and mitigating blowback.

Fueled by weak Mexican state capacity (and by complicity), demand for illicit drugs in the United States, and a steady flow of guns south, violent transnational criminal groups have morphed from relatively small-scale trafficking operations to sophisticated organizations, combining the financial networks and political influence of multinational corporations with the lethality of private military contractors.

Although Mexico, with U.S. assistance, has achieved many operational successes in its decades-long battle against the cartels, the fight is, at best, at a stalemate. Mexico's 2006 “kingpin strategy,” which targeted cartel leaders, actually increased violence. In 2008, when the Mérida Initiative institutionalized U.S.-Mexican security cooperation, Mexico's homicide rate stood at about eight murders per 100,000 inhabitants. By 2017, it had mushroomed to 26 per 100,000, largely driven by the growth of organized crime. Abuses by Mexican security forces further eroded public support for a militarized approach to public safety. In reaction to the state's failure to stem rising violence, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador entered office in 2018 declaring the death of the Mérida Initiative, replacing it with a “hugs, not bullets” policy that prioritized social programs and poverty reduction over direct military confrontation with the cartels. “Hugs, not bullets” was no more successful than the Mérida Initiative, however, eventually becoming a byword for government passivity in the face of spiraling criminal violence.

Sheinbaum, López Obrador's successor, has forged a different path. Under her leadership, Mexico has mobilized its intelligence services, army, and national guard against the cartels, setting new records in fentanyl seizures; deployed 10,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexican border; and extradited 55 cartel operatives to the United States. Although Sheinbaum's government may have calibrated these moves in part to reduce tariff pressure from the United States, they nonetheless signal a departure from the approach of the López Obrador administration, which at times denied the very existence of fentanyl production in Mexico.

Mexico remains highly cautious of U.S. security interventions. In August, Sheinbaum announced that, although her government will “cooperate” and “collaborate” with the United States, “there will be no invasion.” That option, she said, is “off the table, absolutely off the table.” Still, Sheinbaum's commitment to fighting the cartels presents opportunities for the United States.

For its part, the Trump administration has aimed to reinscribe the legal classification of cartels to signal a shift in the U.S. approach to fighting transnational criminal organizations. On the first day of his new term, Trump signed an executive order that described cartels as national security risks to the United States and vowed their “total elimination.” The subsequent designation of several transnational criminal organizations as foreign terrorist organizations made available new legal tools to bring charges against those who provide financial or other material support to these groups. The Department of Justice has previously brought material support charges against individuals in the United States who have provided time, labor, or financial assistance to help suspected members of terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda.

The cartels share many traits with the terrorists and insurgents that the United States fought in the post-9/11 era. Like insurgents in Afghanistan and Somalia, the cartels are nonstate actors that take advantage of state failure to exert authority over large swaths of territory. Rank-and-file cartel members, many of whom are part-time participants, are mixed into the population, making it hard to sort the guilty from the innocent. Like the Islamic State (ISIS), cartels use violence to spread fear and achieve their goals through intimidation. And like many terrorist groups, cartels are organized as networks of smaller cells, often with international links.

There are limits to the comparison, however. Unlike the Islamist groups of the post-9/11 period, cartels are generally motivated by profit, not ideology, a characteristic that lowers barriers to recruitment and widens the appeal of membership. In most cases, they seek less to replace the government than to intimidate, subvert, and corrupt it. Furthermore, Mexico is not a faraway country but a U.S. neighbor with much deeper cultural, historical, and diplomatic ties to the United States than Afghanistan or Iraq have. U.S. counterterrorism and counterinsurgency methods, if they are used, must be modified to reflect these differences.

Past U.S. counterterrorism campaigns have benefited from intelligence sharing and cooperation with allies, who can use local police and security services to monitor potential terrorists and arrest them. In Mexico, many cartels exhibit poor operational security, enabling intelligence agencies to intercept their communications, track their movements, and compile information about organization membership, hierarchy, activities, operating structure, and patterns of behavior. Intelligence collected mostly by U.S. agencies then can be used by Mexican military, intelligence, and police forces to capture or kill cartel leaders and strike the groups' training camps and facilities. Once cartel members are captured, intelligence is also necessary to prosecute them in courts of law. Monitoring cartels' financing, furthermore, can eventually lead to the arrest of financiers and enable the Treasury Department to cut off correspondent banking with financial institutions in the United States or target and seize individual cartel members' bank accounts, denying them access to payment networks and effectively halting the flow of money into the groups' coffers. In June, for example, the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network identified three Mexican financial institutions suspected of involvement in cartel-related money laundering, prohibiting certain economic transactions involving these banks.

Historically, U.S.-Mexican intelligence cooperation has been rocky, owing to mistrust, a difference in goals, and the weak capabilities of Mexican intelligence agencies, which produce relatively small amounts of actionable intelligence. But U.S. agencies produce plenty of intelligence that can fill the gap, especially now that the U.S. military has increased intelligence collection on the border and the CIA has expanded a program, which began under the Biden administration, to use unarmed drones to gather intelligence on cartel labs and redoubts. As long as Washington continues to share its information with trusted agencies within the Mexican government, Mexican security forces can use it to interdict cartel activity. The United States could also increase technical aid, expand information and analysis centers that pool intelligence across multiple agencies and assist decision-making known as fusion cells, and target financial support to Mexican intelligence and police services.

As Washington considers military options short of an invasion, one that became a common tool in counterterrorism campaigns is raids by special operations forces. Carried out in countries including Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, and Syria, such raids eliminated senior terrorist leaders including al-Qaeda's Osama bin Laden and ISIS's Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, degraded or dismantled insurgent cells, and provided opportunities to gather intelligence that enabled subsequent operations. Yet there can be steep costs if the raid goes wrong. Sobering examples include a 2017 raid in Yakla, Yemen, which left one Navy SEAL dead and several others wounded, and the 1993 Operation Gothic Serpent in Mogadishu, Somalia, which triggered a firefight that resulted in the deaths of 18 U.S. soldiers and hundreds of Somalis. Failed or controversial raids can provoke political scrutiny and erode public support for ongoing military operations. Civilian casualties, such as those in the 2017 Yakla raid, can further undermine local support and serve as powerful propaganda for militant groups.



In theory, special operations forces deployed to Mexico could eliminate cartel members, disrupt hubs of drug and human trafficking activities, and collect actionable intelligence in the process. But carrying out such raids would come with considerable risk. These operations always endanger U.S. personnel and, especially when they happen in densely populated urban areas, risk collateral damage. Given the large numbers of U.S. citizens who live in and visit Mexico (and the many family members of U.S. citizens in Mexico), civilian harm could trigger a strong public response at home in a way that civilian casualties in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen never did. A botched operation would also jeopardize broader security cooperation with the Mexican government. And if the U.S. military executed raids without the Mexican government's consent, the violation of sovereignty could further imperil collaboration between the two countries.

A safer alternative to sending in special operations forces is to use drones. Over decades of U.S. counterterrorism efforts, drones have been used in one-off strikes against top leadership and in sustained campaigns targeting the middle ranks of an organization. Sustained drone strikes against al-Qaeda in Pakistan removed key figures, disrupted communications and organizational processes, forced leaders into hiding, and prevented the establishment of large-scale training camps. Yet even successful drone campaigns rarely destroy a group entirely. They force decentralization, which does make it harder for terrorist groups, especially those with far-flung affiliates, to coordinate globally and carry out acts of spectacular violence that require a high degree of training and skill. That lack of coordination, however, can create a fragmented foe that is more difficult to completely defeat. Moreover, U.S. drone campaigns have resulted in significant numbers of civilian deaths. The U.S. drone campaign in Pakistan from 2004 to 2018, for example, killed between 303 and 969 Pakistani civilians.

A drone campaign against cartels in Mexico might kill leaders, disrupt the transport of drugs, and destroy production facilities. But this sort of drone campaign would face strong headwinds. Cartels are primarily motivated by profit, so their leadership is generally easier to replace than that of ideological terrorist groups because of the material benefits that usually accompany membership in a cartel. Leadership decapitation also tends to be more successful for small (less than 500 members), new (fewer than ten years old), and centralized networks. Cartels, however, can easily become decentralized, and many of the best-known transnational criminal networks are large and relatively established. And if the bloody turf wars catalyzed by the kingpin strategy is any indication, drone campaigns would create additional fighting among cartels for control of the drug trade, likely killing many civilians in the process.

Given the risks of and likely backlash to both drone strikes and targeted raids, the United States should consider other strategies to suppress Mexico's cartel operations. Some of the U.S. military's most expansive counterterrorism efforts have involved securing territory to exert pressure on and deny safe haven to terrorist groups. In both Afghanistan and Iraq, U.S. forces attempted to destroy bases where terrorist groups could organize, plan, and train, and to stop “ratlines”—clandestine movement and supply networks—that enabled terrorists to infiltrate government-controlled areas. To secure Baghdad, for example, the United States had to secure neighboring residential, industrial, and agricultural areas and roadways—the so-called Baghdad Belts—that insurgents were using to stage attacks.

To impede smuggling routes and disrupt cartel operations, the United States could establish a buffer zone along the U.S.-Mexican border, perhaps extending into northern Mexico, by increasing border patrol and military deployments, as well as defensive measures such as physical barriers and sensors. Maritime buffers, established by increasing U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Navy patrols and maritime surveillance, could also prevent cartels from island hopping between countries in the Caribbean with poor littoral security to move drugs and precursor chemicals without detection. A more ambitious alternative would see U.S. forces work with Mexican forces to seize and occupy key cartel strongholds deep in Mexican territory, including in Sinaloa, Michoacán, Jalisco, and Tamaulipas. These efforts could be modeled after counterinsurgency campaigns such as those in Fallujah during the war in Iraq or in Kandahar during the war in Afghanistan, proceeding through the steps of clearing territory, holding it through persistent patrols, and then strengthening local governance and policing capacity.

Occupying cartel hotbeds deeper in Mexico could enable the U.S. military to dismantle infrastructure, capture or kill the groups' leaders, and restore the Mexican government's control over its own territory. But sending U.S. forces into the Mexican interior would demand a significant commitment of personnel, provoke cartel retaliation, risk prolonged conflict in occupied areas, and jeopardize the Sheinbaum administration's cooperation. As terrorist groups in Iraq and Afghanistan did, cartel fighters could use civilian populations as shields. And even if military operations were coordinated with the Mexican government, they could lead to a fierce backlash in Mexico against the United States. Sticking to buffer zones would not come without risk: this strategy would endanger U.S. personnel and require long-term joint operations with the Mexican army. But the risk would be lower than in a larger occupation of cartel territory, and this approach could still enable important gains, such as denying traffickers access to key corridors, disrupting cross-border activity, exposing cartel movements to greater surveillance and interdiction, and creating secure staging areas for U.S. intelligence collection and rapid response operations in Mexico.

Finally, U.S. counterterrorism strategies have often included efforts to improve the capacity of partner governments and their military forces, which may be poorly trained, corrupt, brutal, and politicized, in an attempt to prepare them to fight terrorists on their own. Partner governments typically welcome these efforts; unlike unilateral U.S. military action, they do not threaten the country's sovereignty. When successful, U.S. training can make foreign militaries, police, and intelligence services more effective and willing to act by themselves, ensuring that long-term counterterrorism campaigns are less costly and risky for the United States.

Building the capacity of a partner, however, is difficult. Not only does U.S. training often fail to guarantee respect for human rights or improve norms of civilian control; it often fails to equip a foreign military for victory. Despite years of training and tens of billions of dollars in spending, U.S.-backed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan fell apart when facing smaller numbers of lightly armed opponents. Mexico's track record does not necessarily promise a better outcome. Mexican security forces have already been receiving U.S. training and aid for years, yet their capacity is still lacking, and cartel-linked corruption is common at all levels of government. Recently uncovered networks of fuel theft in the armed forces do not inspire confidence. Nonetheless, Sheinbaum is under intense political pressure, from both Washington and from many Mexicans rightly preoccupied with violence, to deliver security gains. Washington should not abandon its approach of working with and training vetted units within the Mexican army and navy.

If the United States charges into Mexico with no regard for the political or military consequences, the end result could be a disaster. Washington would no doubt do some damage to major drug cartels, but the overall flow of drugs might not change substantially, and violence in Mexico might increase as the chaos leads to competition among surviving groups. Some cartels could even conduct revenge attacks across the border. The diplomatic consequences could be even more consequential. Mexico could end its migration and security cooperation, reducing overall pressure on cartels and curtailing enforcement actions with long track records of success, even as showy U.S. efforts proceed. The resulting anger in Mexico could easily spill over into other areas of the U.S.-Mexican partnership, including trade, undermining one of Washington's most important economic and diplomatic relationships.

To avoid this outcome, Washington should prioritize strengthening its intelligence relationship with Mexico City, improving land and maritime border security, and building Mexico's capacity to fight the cartels with targeted security assistance and training. Doing so could reduce the cartels' freedom of action, increase their costs of doing business, and over time, reduce the flow of drugs to the United States. The Trump administration has a unique opportunity to rewrite the rules of U.S.-Mexican security cooperation. The Sheinbaum government views Trump's threats of using force unilaterally as credible, especially after the strike on the Venezuelan vessel, and Mexico has proved willing to compromise, as long as the United States does not cross the country's redline against raids on Mexican soil.

Trump has long criticized the United States' forever wars in the Middle East. He is well aware of how U.S. interventions in the name of counterterrorism can go wrong. Mining the long and often sordid history of these efforts can provide the Trump administration with lessons for the fight against transnational crime. But to embrace the entire U.S. counterterrorism playbook without considering what may and may not work against the cartels would be to court catastrophe.

            A deal has been reached between the Trump administration and China to keep TikTok operational in the United States, administration officials announced Monday, concluding a yearslong effort that began during President Donald Trump's first term.
    


            US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that a framework agreement has been reached, and Trump will speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping Friday to finalize the deal.
    


            “President Trump played a role in this, we had a call with him last night, we had specific guidance from him we shared it with our Chinese counterparts,” Bessent said in Madrid on Monday. “Without his leadership and the leverage he provides, we would not have been able to include the deal today.”
    


            The Trump administration did not name the US-backed buyer, but the group is widely expected to be led by Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison, who last week briefly became the world's richest person. Trump in January had said he would champion Ellison, a Trump supporter, buying the app's US assets.
    


            Chinese and US diplomats have been meeting this week in Spain to discuss trade and other matters. Bessent, leading the latest round of trade talks with China on behalf of the United States, had said that TikTok was one of the subjects likely to be discussed.
    


            “We were very focused on TikTok and making sure that it was a deal that is fair for the Chinese and completely respects US national security concerns, and that's the deal we reached,” said US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Monday. “And of course, we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that US national security comes first.”
    


            TikTok and its parent company ByteDance did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment about the status of a deal.
    


            Trump multiple times has extended a self-imposed deadline to reach a deal with China to sell at least part of TikTok parent company ByteDance's US TikTok business to an American-backed owner. A bipartisan bill passed by Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden banned TikTok in the United States because of national security concerns, allowing the app to continue operating in America only if its China-based owner divested its stake in the US assets of the social media company.
    

The White House launched a new TikTok account, just weeks away from President Trump's extended deadline for TikTok to sell the app.


White House joins TikTok amid uncertainty over app's future



            TikTok briefly went dark in the United States on January 18, the day before the Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act went into effect. But on January 19, one day before Trump took office for his second term, he said he would sign an executive action upon the beginning of his term that would ensure US companies would not be punished for hosting TikTok on their app stores or servers.
    


            The executive order, signed on January 20, delayed for 75 days the enforcement of the law. Trump extended the deadline again in June. The deadline had most recently been extended to September 17, but Trump was widely expected to move the deadline again if a deal didn't come together in time.
    


            The law gives the president broad discretion on how to enforce the ban. But critics have said Trump's extensions thwarted the will of Congress.
    


            Trump toward the end of his first term had advocated for banning TikTok — a policy he never got passed but which Biden eventually supported and signed into law. But Trump's opinion eventually changed after he viewed the social media app as contributing to his election victory in 2024.
    


            TikTok boasts around 170 million US users, many of them young people – a contingent that offered significantly more support to the Republican presidential candidate in the 2024 election than that segment of the population has in recent years. Trump has repeatedly said a deal is close, but no breakthrough emerged until Monday.
    


            Several investment groups have come forward in recent months saying that they would be interested in buying TikTok. Among the most prominent has been led by former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt and investor Kevin O'Leary of “Shark Tank” fame, who have made several public pleas to own TikTok, and who made an offer to ByteDance.
    


            But TikTok would likely cost more than the group can afford — likely in the tens of billions of dollars. So that group said it offered to purchase TikTok's US assets without the app's secret sauce: its algorithm that hooks users into watching video after video on the platform. They said they were convinced they could create a comparable algorithm from scratch.
    


            That's why industry analysts believe a much more likely candidate to buy TikTok's US assets is Ellison, who has the capability of leading a group of investors with the money to buy the algorithm — and whose company already has a relationship with TikTok.
    


            Oracle in 2020 began hosting TikTok's US data, and it briefly reached a deal with the first Trump administration that year to buy TikTok, before that deal was ultimately blocked.
    


            Trump has previously said he would seek a 50-50 joint venture between ByteDance and a new American owner. It has since been heavily debated whether any amount of Chinese ownership would be allowed by law, and the Trump administration didn't clarify what kind of agreement it had secured on Monday.
    


            China, up until this point, has been hesitant to allow ByteDance to give up its US stake. But as trade tensions between the companies reached an inflection point in the spring and continued throughout the summer – evidenced by China's announcement Monday that Nvidia had violated its antitrust laws – Chinese authorities apparently decided that it should play ball.
    


            The agreement also appears to be a precursor to a Trump-Xi meeting that both sides have sought for months. Trump in late October and early November has an Asia trip planned, and their first in-person meeting of Trump's second term could, in theory, take place then.
    


            Trump on Monday hinted that a deal is now close.
    


            “The big Trade Meeting in Europe between The United States of America, and China, has gone VERY WELL! It will be concluding shortly,” Trump said Monday in a post on Truth Social. “A deal was also reached on a ‘certain' company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save. They will be very happy! I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday.”
    


Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly attributed a quote characterizing the deal as fair for China while respecting US national security concerns. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer issued that statement.

            Following the Mediterranean diet reduces your risk of gum disease, which reduces your risk for inflammation that leads to chronic disease and dementia, a new study found.

Mediterranean diet: How to start (and stay on) one of the world's healthiest diets



            “We've known for a really long time that periodontal or gum health is associated with cardiovascular disease and vice versa — they're interconnected. We also know that people that have periodontal disease typically have markers of inflammation,” said Freeman, who was not involved in the study.
    


            How does that connect to chronic disease? Inflammation can cause vascular disease — the narrowing, weakening or even blockage of blood vessels — that can damage organs such as the kidneys, lungs, liver and of course the brain. Vascular dementia is the second most common form of cognitive deterioration after Alzheimer's disease.
    


            Inflammation also riles up the immune system, which can spiral out of control and attack the heart and other organs. Chronic inflammation also promotes insulin resistance and cellular dysfunction that can lead to type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease, a growing concern.
    


            “It certainly makes sense that if you are eating a very clean, predominantly plant-based diet such as the Mediterranean diet, inflammation is down,” Freeman said.
    


            “But this can't be the American version of the Mediterranean diet — the one with tons of lamb and feta cheese,” he added. “This has to be the real deal — a true plant-first diet.”
    


            Studies have found the award-winning Mediterranean diet can reduce the risk for diabetes, high cholesterol, dementia, memory loss, depression and breast cancer. The diet, which is more of an eating style than a restricted diet, has also been linked to stronger bones and a healthier heart.
    


            The diet features simple, plant-based cooking, with the majority of each meal focused on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds, with a few nuts and a heavy emphasis on extra-virgin olive oil. Fats other than olive oil, such as butter, are consumed rarely, if at all, and sugar and refined foods are reserved for special occasions.
    


            Red meat is used sparingly, usually only to flavor a dish. Eating healthy, oily fish, which are packed with omega-3 fatty acids, is encouraged, while eggs, dairy and poultry are eaten in much smaller portions than in the traditional Western diet.
    


            Social interactions during meals and exercise are basic cornerstones of the Mediterranean style of eating. Lifestyle changes that are part of the diet include eating with friends and family, socializing over meals, mindfully eating favorite foods, as well as mindful movement and exercise.

            The research, published Monday in the Journal of Periodontology, included 200 study participants in the United Kingdom. Scientists performed dental exams and took blood samples — participants also filled out dietary questionnaires.
    


            “Low adherence to Mediterranean diet and higher red meat consumption were associated with severity of periodontal disease,” said senior study author Luigi Nibali, a dentist and professor of periodontology at King's College London in an email.
    


            The study found that the people who ate more red meat and did not follow the Mediterranean diet had higher levels of circulating inflammatory markers, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP).
    


            “These markers increase in the presence of trauma or inflammation anywhere in the body. However, sometimes there is an exaggerated response which can lead to more gum disease. Higher levels of these markers mean more inflammation,” Nibali said.
    


            “Higher consumption of vegetables, legumes and dairy products were correlated with lower inflammatory marker C-reactive protein, so they seem to be helpful. There were some beneficial trends also for fruit and olive oil,” he added.
    


            In fact, prior research has shown that chewing green leafy and cruciferous vegetables, root vegetables, apples, and citrus fruit — all key parts of the Mediterranean diet — can promote healthy teeth and gums. These beneficial foods provide “nutrients and a salivary response that improves bacterial health, which then improves overall inflammation,” Freeman said.
    


            While the study's finding are not surprising, Freeman said, “it's certainly a good reminder to pay attention to your teeth. And then if you eat a diet that is more in line with the health of the body, everything seems to be better, including your teeth.”

            President Donald Trump, high-level administration and Republican Party officials, and top political influencers are expected to converge in Arizona on Sunday to honor Charlie Kirk, the assassinated conservative activist.
    


            But the memorial service, to be held at the massive State Farm Stadium in Glendale, just outside Phoenix, is going to pose an enormous test for law enforcement, particularly the US Secret Service, an agency already facing strain and enormous pressure.
    


            And the reason for the gathering — a single, fatal bullet intended to silence a political figure — only underscores the risks.
    


            It remains to be seen whether the memorial will be designated as a national special security event, which would provide additional resources from the federal government, working in tandem with state and local authorities.
    


            “The Secret Service joins the nation in offering our deepest condolences to the Kirk family and friends,” Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement. “Joint security planning is underway for the memorial and funeral of Charlie Kirk and appropriate public safety related information will be provided as the process matures in the coming days.”
    


            CNN has also reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment.
    


            State Farm Stadium has a capacity of more than 63,000 people, and registration to attend the event is open to the public, requiring a name, email, cellphone and ZIP code.
    


            The stadium — home to the Arizona Cardinals NFL team — has a retractable roof, meaning it can be enclosed or open air. The memorial, announced Saturday by Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA, is coming together quickly, scrambling law enforcement to arrive on site, position magnetometers and other resources, survey the interior and exterior of the space, and prepare a fulsome plan to combat risk.
    


            “This location may be seen as an attractive target for a hostile actor because of its visibility. The potential for it to be disrupted through a series of different threats, or even the threat of a threat, is something that law enforcement really has to focus in on and then put the mitigation protocols in place now,” said Jonathan Wackrow, a former US Secret Service agent and CNN contributor who specializes in risk management.
    


            That will require efforts to mitigate the possibility of incidents like vehicles ramming into crowds and biological threats, the positioning of counter-snipers in and outside the arena, and the protection of high-profile figures such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has indicted he's likely to attend.
    


            The White House has requested an additional $58 million in security funding for the executive and judicial branches following Kirk's assassination, a Republican congressional aide told CNN on Monday. And that request, first reported by Punchbowl News, is being “actively processed” in the context of a stopgap funding bill, the aide said.
    


            Kirk's murder is already forcing political figures and the people who protect them to make agonizing choices, balancing whether the public's access to them is worth the risk.
    


            Since Kirk's assassination, several campaigns or political groups have already called off events out of an abundance of caution. And as the midterm elections approach, candidates will increasingly be forced to weigh their need to connect with constituents and potential voters against the reality of practicing politics at a time of accelerating threats, attempted attacks and slayings.
    


            “There are a bunch of blinking red warning signs right now for individuals, whether you're a member of Congress, you're an elected official at the federal, state or local level, or, as with Charlie Kirk, a key political influencer, to be out there right now promoting your own political thoughts,” said Wackrow.
    


            “Why? Because what we're seeing is this massive shift in people normalizing targeted killing because of grievance,” he warned, pointing to Kirk's killing, along with the recent assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband at their home, and the Manhattan murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson.
    


            The event also comes at a unique moment of extreme demands on the Secret Service. Trump and the first lady are set to travel to the United Kingdom for a state visit this week ahead of the service, requiring resources abroad. And one of the biggest events the Secret Service supports each year, the United Nations General Assembly, will be underway early next week in New York City. The agency is responsible for protecting more than 100 visiting foreign dignitaries.
    


            While the reputation of the US Secret Service is one of precision, vigilance and security, the reality has been more complicated — a high-stress, high-intensity workplace that has at times been wracked by management and logistical issues.
    


            “This is going to push the Secret Service to its limit,” Wackrow said, “It's all hands on deck — but there's multiple decks.”
    


            With finite resources, the agency could have to scale back its readiness in one area to secure another, Wackrow said.
    


            “I am sure that the moment that this event is over on Sunday, there will be planes ready to bring everybody back to New York, but you potentially have a gap that's exposed in New York,” he said. “And if you think that foreign entities aren't watching that and looking for it, don't be fooled. They are.”

            Memphis is bracing for the potential arrival of the National Guard as President Donald Trump's administration intensifies its efforts to crack down on crime across the nation's major cities.
    


            “We're going to Memphis,” Trump told “Fox & Friends” in an interview Friday, calling the Democratic-led city “deeply troubled” and “we're going to fix that just like we did Washington.”
    


            Speaking to CNN, Mayor Paul Young said Saturday he was “not happy” about the National Guard potentially coming to his city, but that he was looking for ways to invest in addressing crime in the city.
    


            The potential deployment is part of Trump's broader effort to expand his anti-crime push nationwide and would mark the first such effort in a Republican state, at a time when the president has faced increasing scrutiny for his targeting of Democratic-led cities.
    


Trump says he's targeting Memphis in crime crackdown



            Tennessee Republicans, including Gov. Bill Lee, have welcomed the announcement, with Lee saying Friday he had been in touch with Trump to develop a plan to fight crime in the city.
    


            While no specific details about the Memphis deployment have been announced, here's what we know so far about the potential deployment:
    


            The announcement to deploy troops to Memphis comes after weeks of speculation that Chicago was the next city to be targeted by the Trump administration. But Trump's plans were shelved after advisers warned him that sending in troops to help with local law enforcement without buy-in from the state's governor could create legal headaches they want to avoid, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            While he has privately argued he has the power to send the National Guard where he wants, Trump is instead setting his sights on Memphis, where the state's Republican leadership is willing to accept federal help, the sources said.
    


            Mayor Young said Trump's televised announcement on Fox News was the first definitive confirmation he heard of the plans to deploy the National Guard to his city.
    


            Young told CNN that he learned the idea was under consideration when Republican Gov. Bill Lee's office informed him earlier in the week. The Democratic mayor said he had been talking with the governor's office about the possibility of getting more law enforcement presence through the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
    


            The details were expected to be formally announced on Monday, but the president chose to publicize the initiative on Friday morning. While many elements of the operation are still being finalized, the first troops could be deployed as early as this week.
    


            The Trump administration's Memphis plans will mirror their DC crackdown, including forming a task force with local law enforcement, sources said. Unlike blue states, DC's status as a federal district allows the administration to more easily secure cooperation from the city's Democratic mayor.
    


            Young told CNN he expects more details this week, including the number of troops, their arrival date and their duties. He suggested the guard might assist with traffic control for major events, monitoring surveillance cameras, or neighborhood “beautification” efforts.
    


            Last week, Young briefed city council members and held a conference call with business leaders to prepare for the guard's potential arrival, CNN affiliate WATN reported.
    


            A White House official said the president's decision to deploy National Guard troops to Memphis was about crime.
    


            “In 2024 Memphis had the highest violent crime rate, highest property crime rate, and third highest murder rate in the U.S. (Trump) wants to make all cities in America safe again and it's great that local officials in Memphis are welcoming his help,” the White House official said.
    


            Just days before Trump's announcement, Memphis police had reported significant progress, with drops in every major crime category in the first eight months of 2025 compared with the same period in previous years. Overall crime hit a 25-year low, and murder a six-year low, police said.
    


As Trump administration unleashes federal show of force in DC, other US cities on president's radar push back



            Local leaders have urged the governor to reconsider the president's push to send National Guard troops to the city. Lee Harris, the mayor of Shelby County – where Memphis is located – called the deployment a threat to democracy and city councilmembers have called for restored federal funding for violence-prevention programs instead of a military presence.
    


            State Rep. Justin J. Pearson, whose district includes parts of Memphis and Shelby County, said Monday “there is no red carpet being laid out” for the National Guard.
    


            “A militarized occupation of our city is not a resolution to the problems that we have,” Pearson said at a Shelby County Democratic Party news conference Monday at Memphis city hall.
    


            “What we need is poverty eradication, not military occupation,” Pearson said. “So don't bring the National Guard. Give us the resources that we need for our people, for our city, for our county.”
    


            Young said the National Guard was last deployed to Memphis in 1968, following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. However, the National Guard also was in Memphis in 1978 after Memphis police and firefighters' unions went on strike.
    


            Young acknowledged community concerns. “We don't want to invoke those same images here,” Young told CNN, referring to the 1968 deployment.
    


            Since deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles in June and to Washington, DC, last month, the Trump administration has threatened to send troops to several other Democratic-led cities like Baltimore and Portland.
    


            Trump's decision to assert federal control over Washington's police force and deploy the National Guard to patrol the capital marked an unprecedented move and one he claimed was necessary to fight crime. But critics have called it a “dangerous power grab.”



            While crime has decreased in Washington, DC, under the federal emergency, it's not true that there's “no crime,” as Trump has often repeated.
    


            The president's authority over DC's National Guard and police stems from the city's federal status, but his power doesn't extend to states.
    


            Trump's earlier attempts to deploy the National Guard have faced legal challenges. In June, he sent 2,000 California Guard troops to Los Angeles against Gov. Gavin Newsom's will, citing protests against aggressive immigration raids.
    


            Newsom took the decision to court, where a federal judge ruled the deployment was illegal. The administration said it would appeal the decision.
    


Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled the last name of Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris.

            President Donald Trump said Monday he will call a national emergency once again in Washington, DC, if local police do not cooperate with immigration enforcement.
    


            The president said in a Truth Social post overnight that his initial order had reduced crime in the district but that if local police do not cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, crime would rise again.
    


            His comments come after the national emergency and federal takeover he declared in August expired last week. Trump has said the move, which included sending in National Guard troops, is necessary to fight crime and has threatened to target other mostly Democratic-run cities. But critics have called it a “dangerous power grab.”



            Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser issued an order on September 2 requiring the city to cooperate with federal law enforcement indefinitely, clarifying however, that DC did not need a “federal emergency.”
    


            But her order did not mention ICE, with Bowser saying last week she did not expect the local Metropolitan Police Department to participate in immigration enforcement. Instead, she said she expected the department to return to its “status quo.”
    


            “Immigration enforcement is not what MPD does, and with the end of the emergency, it won't be what MPD does in the future,” she added.
    


            “Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has presided over this violent criminal takeover of our Capital for years, has informed the Federal Government that the Metropolitan Police Department will no longer cooperate with ICE in removing and relocating dangerous illegal aliens,” Trump wrote Monday.
    


            “If I allowed this to happen, CRIME would come roaring back. To the people and businesses of Washington, D.C., DON'T WORRY, I AM WITH YOU, AND WON'T ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN. I'll call a National Emergency, and Federalize, if necessary!!!”
    


            While crime has decreased in Washington under the federal emergency, it's not true that there's now “no crime,” as Trump has often repeated.
    


            Trump's latest post marks a change in tone from his previous comments about Bowser, whom he has praised in recent weeks for her cooperation with federal authorities. White House officials even told CNN that Trump did not mind letting the 30-day takeover end — mainly because he felt the city has taken steps to cooperate.
    


What we know about Trump's push to send the National Guard to Memphis



            Washington's Home Rule Act — which grants Congress oversight and authority over the capital city while allowing residents limited self-governance — allows the president to take control of DC's police for 30 days during an emergency, but any extension would have required congressional action.
    


            Trump, meanwhile, has threatened to send National Guard troops to other cities in recent weeks as part of a crack down on crime, including Chicago, Boston and most-recently Memphis, Tennessee, where officials are bracing for a potential operation this week.
    


            The president ended up shelving his plans to target Chicago after advisers warned him that sending in troops without the Illinois governor's support could create legal headaches, sources familiar with the matter told CNN last week.
    


            In Washington, DC, the federal operation is highly unpopular, with roughly 8 in 10 residents opposing it, according to a Washington Post-Schar School poll.
    


            As part of the operation, there has been a surge in immigration arrests, with immigrant workers saying people feel scared in the city.
    


            In late August, when Bowser was asked whether Trump's crime emergency was a pretext to enforce the administration's immigration efforts, the mayor said that an order from Attorney General Pam Bondi “almost exclusively focused on immigration enforcement and homeless encampment enforcement.”
    


            “So I'll let you draw your own conclusion,” Bowser said.
    


            Bowser's office declined to comment on Trump's post.

Speaking at a joint news conference in Jerusalem, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked the United States for their support and pledged to defeat Hamas so it no longer poses a threat to Israel.

The U.S. State Department says Secretary of State Marco Rubio will head to Qatar after meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel. The visit announced Monday comes as the region is still reeling from Israel's strike targeting Hamas leaders in the Qatari capital, Doha. The U.S. has sought to ease tensions between Israel and Qatar, two close American allies.

Netanyahu and Rubio stood shoulder-to-shoulder in Jerusalem and downplayed the furor that had, at least for a short time, taken the Trump administration aback. There were no signs of U.S. frustration or annoyance with Israel's latest moves, although President Donald Trump had made clear his displeasure with Israel's unilateral strike on Hamas in Qatar.

While speaking at a summit over Israel's attack last week, Qatar's ruling emir accused Israel of not caring about its hostages held in the Gaza Strip and instead only working to “ensure Gaza is no longer livable.”

Comey sued the U.S. government on Monday over her abrupt July dismissal, saying it came without cause or notice and was unconstitutional.

The lawsuit was filed in Manhattan federal court, where Comey had earned praise for her handling of major complex prosecutions, particularly in sexual abuse cases.

Comey, whose father is former FBI Director James Comey, became a rising star in her office for her work on the case against financier Jeffrey Epstein and his onetime girlfriend, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell and the recent trial of music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs.

Comey's firing came a day after her supervisors asked her to take the lead on a major public corruption case and three months after she received her latest “outstanding” review, according to the lawsuit.

Vance welcomed Miller, a top White House adviser, as his first guest, and the conversation turned toward fighting what the vice president described as “festering violence on the far left.”

“With God as my witness, we're going to use every resource we have at the Department of Justice, Homeland Security and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks,” Miller said.

Miller added that “it will happen, and we will do it in Charlie's name.”

Vance used similar rhetoric in his own remarks, saying “we're going to go after the NGO network that foments, facilitates and engages in violence.”

Law enforcement officials have said they believe the suspect accused of killing Kirk acted alone.

The Trump administration said it's asking Congress to increase funding for the U.S. Marshals Service and security for the Supreme Court.

The request sent to Congress for an additional $58 million comes in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination.

In its request, the Trump administration noted an increase in threats to public officials. The funding, if approved, would be available through September 2027.

The vice president flew to Utah on Air Force Two to help transport Kirk's casket to his home state of Arizona for burial.

During a conversation with Kirk's widow, Vance said she told him that Kirk never raised his voice” and “was never cross or mean-spirited to her.”

Vance said he would aspire to that in his own life.

“I took from that moment that I needed to be a better husband and I needed to be a better father,” he said.

Sitting in his ceremonial office, the vice president said he was “filling in for somebody who cannot be filled in for, but I'll do my best.”

Vance described Kirk as “a joyful warrior for our country.”

The White House played live video of the show on screens in the press briefing room.



Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard says she's experienced a “flood of emotion” following the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk, who Gabbard called a friend and an inspiration to many Americans.

Speaking on Meghan McCain's podcast on Monday, Gabbard said Kirk's death shows there is a “darkness” in American politics. She urged Americans to seek unity and peace and to find ways to make their political points without violence or hate.

Kirk's death should prompt Americans to ask “How can I use my life in service to God, to make a positive impact?” Gabbard said. “None of us knows when our time will come.”

Gabbard said she got to know Kirk in recent years as both became prominent names in conservative politics. She appeared at many events with Kirk and recalled him as an “incredibly kind” person. She said she valued his political insight and turned to him for his counsel.

“Charlie was one of the first people that I spoke to,” Gabbard said.

Following a two-day trade talk in Madrid, Li Chenggang, China's international trade representative, said China and the United States have reached “basic framework consensus” to solve TikTok-related issues in a cooperative way, reduce investment barriers and promote related economic and trade cooperation, according to China's official news agency Xinhua.

Li said the two sides had “candid, in-depth” discussions over TikTok and matters of concern to China during this trade talk. Details of the agreement are unknown, but Li said China would never seek any deal at the cost of principle, stance, business interests or global fairness and justice. He said China would “firmly” protect national interests and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and approve any “technology export” in accordance with the law.

At the same time, the Chinese government “fully respects the wishes of businesses” and supports the companies to conduct “equal business negotiations” on the basis of market principles.

FBI Director Kash Patel will appear before Oversight committees Tuesday and Wednesday as he faces scrutiny over his leadership of the Charlie Kirk investigation and other areas.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told House Democrats — as well as their spouses and families — on a weekend conference call that he's spoken to Speaker Mike Johnson about security measures for lawmakers.

They are discussing extending the enhanced security measures and funding that were put in place following the attacks on Minnesota lawmakers earlier this year. Those funds expire at the end of the month.

The 1 a.m. Monday social media post appeared to be in response to the city's mayor refusing to cooperate with immigration enforcement.

Trump suggested Mayor Muriel Bowser's decision could allow crime to proliferate in the city, which he said he wouldn't let happen.

“I'll call a National Emergency, and Federalize, if necessary!!!”

The mayor's office declined comment.

Trump's emergency order for the nation's capital, which federalized the police force and launched a law enforcement surge, expired on Sept. 11 after Congress did not renew it. The National Guard and other enforcement authorities remain deployed in the city.

Bowser said the city would continue to cooperate with federal law enforcement agencies after the order expires but ruled out cooperation with ICE.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump said securities regulators should stop requiring companies to issue financial reports every three months and instead switch to a six-month reporting period. The Securities and Exchange Commission has required publicly traded companies to report on a quarterly basis since 1970.

“This will save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies,” Trump wrote.

Trump asked the SEC to examine the three- versus six-month reporting requirement during his first term. No change was made.

Last week, the Long Term Stock Exchange said it planned to petition the SEC to do away with the quarterly requirement. The San Francisco-based exchange lists companies focused on long-term goals.

The visit announced Monday comes as the region is still reeling from Israel's strike targeting Hamas leaders in the Qatari capital, Doha. The U.S. has sought to ease tensions between Israel and Qatar, two close American allies.

Israel and the United States showed a unified front Monday in the face of growing international anger over Israel's airstrikes on Hamas leaders on Qatar and its intensifying bombardment of Gaza City.

As Arab and Muslim leaders met in Doha to condemn Israel's attack last week in Qatar and new rounds of criticism were aired over Israeli plans to occupy Gaza City, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Rubio stood shoulder-to-shoulder in Jerusalem and downplayed the furor that had, at least for a short time, taken the Trump administration aback.

There were no signs of U.S. frustration or annoyance with Israel's latest moves, although President Trump had made clear his displeasure with Israel's unilateral strike on Hamas in Qatar, which is a close U.S. partner. 

And, both Netanyahu and Rubio said they agreed that the only way to end the conflict in Gaza is through the elimination of Hamas and the release of all hostages, setting aside calls for an interim ceasefire in favor of an immediate end to the conflict.

Windsor Castle staff are setting the 50-meter-long (164-feet-long) mahogany table. Grooms are buffing the hooves of the horses that will pull the royal carriages. And the military honor guard is drilling to ensure every step lands with precision.

Throughout the halls and grounds of the almost 1,000-year-old castle west of London, hundreds of people are working to make sure King Charles III puts on the best show possible when he welcomes President Trump for his historic second state visit this week.

The visit, featuring glittering tiaras, brass bands and a sumptuous banquet served on 200-year-old silver, is a display of the pomp and ceremony that Britain does like no one else. But it's a spectacle with a purpose: to bolster ties with one of the world's most powerful men at a time when his America First policies are roiling longstanding trade and security relationships.

Trump posted on his social media site that a meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials went well and that a deal was reached regarding “a ‘certain' company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save.” His comment suggested the company is TikTok, the social media company associated with China that U.S. law requires to be sold or else cease operations.

The U.S. president didn't provide any details on the deal, only that younger Americans “will be very happy!”

He also said he would be speaking Friday with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

Trump credits TikTok with helping him to win the 2024 presidential election.

The president complained about a recent change to kickoff rules that are intended to reduce injuries during high-speed, high-impact punt returns.

The rule, which started last season and was made permanent for this one, places the opposing teams closer together, among other changes.

Trump wrote on Truth Social that it's “ridiculous looking.”

“The ball is moving, and the players are not, the exact opposite of what football is all about. ‘Sissy' football is bad for America, and bad for the NFL!”

Trump has made sporting events an integral part of his presidency — he attended a Yankees baseball game last week — and often views them as another arena for fighting “woke” politics. For example, he threatened to block a new stadium for the Washington Commanders if they don't restore the name Redskins, which was considered offensive to Native Americans.

The vice president was close to the assassinated conservative activist, and on Monday he'll serve as a substitute host for his talk show. It's scheduled to start at noon on Rumble, a streaming platform.

“Please join me as I pay tribute to my friend,” Vance wrote on social media.

The post showed a microphone set up in the vice president's ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which is adjacent to the White House.

The Emmy Awards weren't all about Seth Rogen walking up the aisle in his burnt brown tux to collect yet another award. It just sometimes seemed that way.

Rogen's “The Studio” won a total of 13 Emmys, breaking the all-time record for most wins for a comedy series. Rogen himself won four, tying the record for most Emmys won by a single individual in one night.

“I'm legitimately embarrassed,” Rogen admitted at one point.

But behind the undeniable march of “The Studio” were some other pieces of Emmy history. The youngest male actor ever was crowned for the series “Adolescence” and “Severance” star Tramell Tillman became the first Black actor to win in his category. And the up and down year of Stephen Colbert hit a high. 

Owen Cooper, 15, shattered the Emmy record for youngest male acting winner.

The “Adolescence” star won best supporting actor in a limited or anthology series. The Netflix four-part series which traces the emotional fallout after a U.K. teenage stabbing, became a sensation, a sort of 2025 version of last year's “Baby Reindeer.” 

In his acceptance speech, Cooper revealed he only started acting classes a few years ago and encouraged those watching to step out of their comfort zones.

“A couple years back I didn't expect to be in the United States, let alone here. Tonight proves if you listen, you focus and you step out of your comfort zone, you can achieve anything in life. I was nothing three years ago. I'm here now,” he said.




The record for youngest male actor had previously been held by Scott Jacoby, who was 16 when he won in the supporting drama actor trophy for “That Certain Summer” in 1973. The youngest Emmy winner ever is Roxana Zal, who won a Primetime Emmy for outstanding supporting actress in a limited series in 1984 at age 14.

Cooper beat Javier Bardem, Bill Camp, Rob Delaney, Peter Sarsgaard and his “Adolescence” co-star Ashley Walters.

“The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” won the award for best talk series for the first time, just months after learning it was being canceled.

In July, CBS announced it was ending the show, attributing the cause to financial reasons. The series will go off the air in May 2026.

Colbert, who has hosted his show since 2015, was gracious, thanking CBS for his shot and quoting from Prince's hit “Let's Go Crazy”: “If the elevator tries to bring you down/Go crazy, punch a higher floor.”

Earlier in the night, he turned his time as award presenter into a job ad, getting a standing ovation as he approached the microphone to announce the winner of lead actor in a comedy series.

“While I have your attention, is anyone hiring? Because I've got 200 very well-qualified candidates with me here tonight. We'll be available in June,” he said.

He then pulled out a resume and an old headshot but realized he only had the one copy. “Harrison Ford, could you get this to Spielberg?” He ran over to Ford, who seemed to promise he would.

Tramell Tillman made history, but he made it all about his mom.

The “Severance” star became the first Black actor to win best supporting actor in a drama playing the creepy, unnerving Seth Milchick. 

Tillman thanked his first acting coach — his mother, who was also his date. 

“You remember what you want to remember. You make time for what you want to make for. Do the work. Show up. And most importantly, for the love of God, don't embarrass me in public,” he said. “My first acting coach was tough, y'all, but all great mothers are.”

Tillman, holding the statuette high, added: “This is for you. I am full, I am humbled, I am honored.”

Noah Wyle's narrative was just too powerful to deny. After getting five nominations without a win for “ER,” the actor came back to don scrubs 30 years later and won his first Emmy for playing another emergency doctor on “The Pitt.”

Wyle thanked HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television for allowing “the conditions to exist for lightning to strike in my life twice.”

And then he dedicated his award to those in the health care field.

“To anybody who's going on shift tonight or coming off shift tonight, thank you for being in that job. This is for you,” Wyle said.

CBS is likely wiping its network forehead that a bitterly divided nation didn't make the Emmys a divisive place. 

Yes, Javier Bardem wore a kaffiyeh in support of Palestinians and Television Academy Chairman Cris Abrego criticized Congress for voting to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. But Donald Trump and Charlie Kirk were never mentioned on the broadcast and even Stephen Colbert — never shy to mock the powerful — stayed apolitical.

The most explosive it got was when “Hacks” star Hannah Einbinder ended her acceptance speech win with vocal support for the Philadelphia Eagles, an expletive aimed at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and a call to “free Palestine.”

At the last Emmys, host Anthony Anderson turned to his mother to enforce shorter acceptance speeches. This year host Nate Bargatze used guilt.

He revealed he would pledge $100,000 to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America but that donation would shrink by $1,000 for every second a winner exceeded their 45-second speech limit.

Some winners went too long — like Einbinder, who promised to pay the difference — and some went purposely fast — like John Oliver and Rogen — to take advantage of a new rule Bargatze proposed: Every second saved from the 45-second limit would get back $1,000.

In the end, Bargatze promised to still donate not just the original amount, but — when adding CBS' contribution — came out to be a full $350,000. 

Phylicia Rashad introduced the in memoriam section, highlighting the loss of her TV son, Malcolm Jamal Warner, the “Cosby Show” star who died in July. “Like all our friends and colleagues who transitioned this past year, Malcolm Jamal Warner remains in our hearts.” 

Then Lainey Wilson and Vince Gill sang a tender “Go Rest High on That Mountain” during the tribute, which included Teri Garr, Ozzy Osbourne, Chuck Woolery, Loni Anderson, Bill Moyers, George Wendt, Loretta Swit. Maggie Smith, David Lynch, Richard Chamberlain, Linda Lavin, Anne Burrell, Michelle Trachtenberg and Quincy Jones. Notable absences were Hulk Hogan and Polly Holliday.

The Emmys looked back by celebrating the anniversary of several shows, including having Reba McEntire, Karen Fairchild and Kimberly Schlapman performing the theme song of “The Golden Girls” for its 40th anniversary.

Jeff Probst was on hand to celebrate the 50th season of “Survivor,” presenting the award for scripted variety series as if it was a tribal council meeting. 

Alexis Bledel and Lauren Graham stood in a replica of their Connecticut home set to celebrate “Gilmore Girls,” a coming-of-age story, blending wittiness with relatable family dynamics that celebrated its debut 25 years ago.

Additional tributes honored “Law & Order's” 35th anniversary, featuring Ice-T, Tony Goldwyn, Mariska Hargitay, S. Epatha Merkerson and Christopher Meloni. 

“Grey's Anatomy” — the longest-running prime-time medical drama in American television history — was supposed to mark its 20th anniversary with appearances by Eric Dane and Jesse Williams. Only Williams was there; Dane revealed his ALS diagnosis in April.

Ray Romano and Brad Garrett had a mini-reunion of “Everybody Loves Raymond.” It was one of the night's funniest bits, with both men sad about how long it had taken them to be back at the Emmys. Garrett wondered if he'd make the in memoriam section after he died. “If it's a slow year, no doubt,” Romano told him.

At a time when its leadership is in question and its mission challenged, the Library of Congress has named a new U.S. poet laureate, the much-honored author and translator Arthur Sze.

The library announced Monday that the 74-year-old Sze had been appointed to a one-year term, starting this fall. The author of 12 poetry collections and recipient last year of a lifetime achievement award from the library, he succeeds Ada Limón, who had served for three years. Previous laureates also include Joy Harjo, Louise Glück and Billy Collins.

Speaking during a recent Zoom interview with The Associated Press, Sze acknowledged some misgivings when Rob Casper, who heads the library's poetry and literature center, called him in June about becoming the next laureate. He wondered about the level of responsibilities and worried about the upheaval since President Donald Trump fired Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden in May. After thinking about it overnight, he called Casper back and happily accepted.

“I think it was the opportunity to give something back to poetry, to something that I've spent my life doing,” he explained, speaking from his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico. “So many people have helped me along the way. Poetry has just helped me grow so much, in every way.”

Sze's new job begins during a tumultuous year for the library, a 200-year-old, nonpartisan institution that holds a massive archive of books published in the United States. Trump abruptly fired Hayden after conservative activists accused her of imposing a “woke” agenda, criticism that Trump has expressed often as he seeks sweeping changes at the Kennedy Center, the Smithsonian museums and other cultural institutions.




Hayden's ouster was sharply criticized by congressional Democrats, leaders in the library and scholarly community and such former laureates as Limón and Harjo. It also led to a debate over who has the authority to decide on an interim replacement. 

Although the White House announced that it had named Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche as the acting librarian, daily operations are being run by a longtime official at the library, Robert Randolph Newlen. Events such as the annual National Book Festival have continued without interruption or revision.

Laureates are forbidden to take political positions, although the tradition was breached in 2003 when Collins publicly stated his objections to President George W. Bush's push for war against Iraq.

Newlen is identified in Monday's announcement as acting librarian, a position he was in line for according to the institution's guidelines. He praised Sze, whose influences range from ancient Chinese poets to Wallace Stevens, for his “distinctly American” portraits of the Southwest landscapes and for his “great formal innovation.”

“Like Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman, Sze forges something new from a range of traditions and influences — and the result is a poetry that moves freely throughout time and space,” his statement reads in part.

Sze's official title is poet laureate consultant in poetry, a 1985 renaming of a position established in 1937 as consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress. The mission is loosely defined as a kind of literary ambassador, to “raise the national consciousness to a greater appreciation of the reading and writing of poetry.” Initiatives have included Robert Pinsky's “Favorite Poem Project,” for which the public would share thoughts on works of their choosing, and Limón's “You Are Here,” which included poetry installations at national parks.

Sze wants to focus on a passion going back more than a half-century to his undergraduate years at the University of California, Berkeley — translation. He remembers reading some English-language editions of Chinese poetry, finding the work “antiquated and dated” and deciding to translate some of it himself, writing out the Chinese characters and engaging with them “on a much deeper level” than he had expected. Besides his own poetry, he has published “The Silk Dragon: Translations from the Chinese.”

“I personally learned my own craft of writing poetry through translating poetry,” he says. “I often think that people think of poetry as intimidating, or difficult, which isn't necessarily true. And I think one way to deepen the appreciation of poetry is to approach it through translation.”

Sze is a New York City native and son of Chinese immigrants who in such collections as “Sight Lines” and “Compass Rose” explores themes of cultural and environmental diversity and what he calls “coexisting.” In a given poem, he might shift from rocks above a pond to people begging in a subway, from a firing squad in China to Thomas Jefferson's plantation in Virginia. His many prizes include the National Book Award for “Sight Lines” and such lifetime achievement honors as the Jackson Poetry Prize and the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize.

He loves poetry from around the world but feels at home writing in English, if only for the “richness of the vocabulary” and the wonders of its origins.

“I was just looking at the word ‘ketchup,' which started from southern China, went to Malaysia, was taken to England, where it became a tomato-based sauce, and then, of course, to America,” he says. “And I was just thinking days ago, that's a word we use every day without recognizing its ancestry, how it's crossed borders, how it's entered into the English language and enriched it.”

ATLANTA (AP) — A popular museum in Atlanta is expanding at a critical moment in the United States. And unlike the Smithsonian Institution, the privately funded National Center for Civil and Human Rights is beyond the immediate reach of Trump administration efforts to control what Americans learn about their history.

The monthslong renovation, which cost nearly $60 million, adds six new galleries as well as classrooms and interactive experiences, changing a relatively static museum into a dynamic place where people are encouraged to take action supporting civil and human rights, racial justice and the future of democracy, said Jill Savitt, the center's president and CEO.

The center has stayed active ahead of its Nov. 8 reopening through K-12 education programs that include more than 300 online lesson plans; a LGBTQ+ Institute; training in diversity, equity and inclusion; human rights training for law enforcement; and its Truth & Transformation Initiative to spread awareness about forced labor, racial terror and other historic injustices. 

These are the same aspects of American history, culture and society that the Trump administration is seeking to dismantle.




Dreamed up by civil rights icons Evelyn Lowery and Andrew Young, the center opened in 2014 on land donated by the Coca-Cola Company, next to the Georgia Aquarium and The World of Coca-Cola, and became a major tourist attraction. But ticket sales declined after the pandemic.

Now the center hopes to attract more repeat visitors with immersive experiences like “Change Agent Adventure,” aimed at children under 12. These “change agents” will be asked to pledge to do something — no matter how small — that “reflects the responsibility of each of us to play a role in the world: To have empathy. To call for justice. To be fair, be kind. And that's the ethos of this gallery,” Savitt said. It opens next April.

“I think advocacy and change-making is kind of addictive. It's contagious,” Savitt explained. “When you do something, you see the success of it, you really want to do more. And our desire here is to whet the appetite of kids to see that they can be involved. They can do it.”

This ethos is sharply different from the idea that young people can't handle the truth and must be protected from unpleasant challenges but, Savitt said, “the history that we tell here is the most inspirational history.”

“In fact, I think it's what makes America great. It is something to be patriotically proud of. The way activists over time have worked together through nonviolence and changed democracy to expand human freedom — there's nothing more American and nothing greater than that. That is the lesson that we teach here,” she said.

“Broken Promises,” opening in December, includes exhibits from the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, cut short when white mobs sought to brutally reverse advances by formerly enslaved people. “We want to start orienting you in the conversation that we believe we all kind of see, but we don't say it outright: Progress. Backlash. Progress. Backlash. And that pattern that has been in our country since enslavement,” said its curator, Kama Pierce.

On display will be a Georgia historical marker from the site of the 1918 lynching of Mary Turner, pockmarked repeatedly with bullets, that Turner descendants donated to keep it from being vandalized again. 

“There are 11 bullet holes and 11 grandchildren living,” and the family's words will be incorporated into the exhibit to show their resilience, Pierce said.

Items from the Morehouse College Martin Luther King Jr. collection will have a much more prominent place, in a room that recreates King's home office, with family photos contributed by the center's first guest curator: his daughter, the Rev. Bernice King. “We wanted to lift up King's role as a man, as a human being, not just as an icon,” Savitt explained.

Gone are the huge images of the world's most genocidal leaders — Hitler, Stalin and Mao among others — with explanatory text about the millions of people killed under their orders. In their place will be examples of human rights victories by groups working around the world.

“The research says that if you tell people things are really bad and how awful they are, you motivate people for a minute, and then apathy sets in because it's too hard to do anything,” Savitt said. “But if you give people something to hope for that's positive, that they can see themselves doing, you're more likely to cultivate a sense of agency in people.”

And doubling in capacity is an experience many can't forget: Joining a 1960s sit-in against segregation. Wearing headphones as they take a lunch-counter stool, visitors can both hear and feel an angry, segregationist mob shouting they don't belong. Because this is “heavy content,” Savitt says, a new “reflection area” will allow people to pause afterward on a couch, with tissues if they need them, to consider what they've just been through.

The center's expansion was seeded by Home Depot co-founder and Atlanta philanthropist Arthur M. Blank, the Mellon Foundation and many other donors, for which Savitt expressed gratitude: “The corporate community is in a defensive crouch right now — they could get targeted,” she said.

But she said donors shared concerns about people's understanding of citizenship, so supporting the teaching of civil and human rights makes a good investment.

“It is the story of democracy — Who gets to participate? Who has a say? Who gets to have a voice?” she said. “So our donors are very interested in a healthy, safe, vibrant, prosperous America, which you need a healthy democracy to have.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Songwriter Bobby Hart, a key part of the Monkees' multimedia empire who teamed with Tommy Boyce on such hits as “Last Train to Clarksville” and “I'm Not Your Steppin' Stone,” has died. He was 86. 

Hart died at his home in Los Angeles, according to his friend and co-author, Glenn Ballantyne. He had been in poor health since breaking his hip last year. 

Boyce and Hart were a prolific and successful duo in the mid-1960s, especially for the Monkees, the made-for-television group promoted by Don Kirshner. They wrote the Monkees' theme song, with its opening shot, “Here we come, walkin' down the street,” and enduring chant, “Hey, hey, we're the Monkees,” and their first No. 1 hit, “Last Train to Clarksville.” The Monkees' eponymous, million-selling debut album included six songs from Boyce and Hart, who also served as producers and used their own backing musicians, the Candy Store Prophets, as session players.

AP correspondent Julie Walker reports Bobby Hart, co-wrote ‘Last Train to Clarksville' and other hits for the Monkees, has died at 86.

“I always credit them not only with writing many of our biggest hits, but, as producers, being instrumental in creating the unique Monkee sound we all know and love,” the Monkees' Micky Dolenz wrote in a foreword to Hart's memoir, “Psychedelic Bubblegum,” published in 2015.

As Boyce and Hart grew in fame and the Monkees took more control of their work, they pursued their own careers, releasing the albums “Test Patterns” and “I Wonder What She's Doing Tonite” and appearing on such sitcoms as “I Dream of Jeannie” and “Bewitched.” They also were politically active. They campaigned for Robert F. Kennedy when he ran for president in 1968 and wrote the brassy “L.U.V. (Let Us Vote)” in support of the 26th Amendment, which in 1971 lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. Their other songs included the Monkees' melancholy “I Wanna Be Free” and the theme to the daytime soap opera “Days of Our Lives.” 




They were covered by everyone from Dean Martin (“Little Lovely One”) to the Sex Pistols (“I'm Not Your Steppin' Stone”).

In the 1970s and ‘80s, Hart managed several hits with other collaborators and even contributed material to another TV act, the Partridge Family. He worked with Austin Roberts on “Over You,” an Oscar-nominated ballad performed by Betty Buckley in “Tender Mercies,” and with Dick Eastman on “My Secret (Didja Gitit Yet?)” for New Edition. He and Bryce toured with Dolenz and fellow Monkee Davy Jones in the ‘70s, put out the album “Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart” and received renewed attention when the Monkees enjoyed a comeback in the 1980s.

Boyce, who died in 1994, and Hart were the subjects of a 2014 documentary “The Guys Who Wrote ‘Em.” Hart was married twice, most recently to singer Mary Ann Hart, and had two children from his first marriage.

He was a minister's son, born Robert Luke Harshman in Phoenix, Arizona. In his memoir, he remembered himself as a shy kid with a “strong desire to distinguish” himself, as he wrote in “Psychedelic Bubblegum.” Music was the answer. By high school, he had learned piano, guitar and the Hammond B-3 organ. He also started his own amateur radio station, eventually adding a console, turntables and microphones. After graduating from high school and serving in the Army reserves, he settled in Los Angeles in the late 1950s, hoping first to become a disc jockey, but soon working as a songwriter and session musician. His name shortened to Bobby Hart, he toured as a member of Teddy Randazzo and the Dazzlers, and with Randazzo and Bobby Weinstein wrote “Hurt So Bad,” a hit for Little Anthony and the Imperials later covered by Linda Ronstadt.

He also befriended Boyce, a singer and songwriter from Charlottesville, Virginia, with a “very unusual personality, spontaneous and extroverted, yet very cool at the same time.” Boyce and Hart helped write the top 10 hit “Come a Little Bit Closer” for Jay and the Americans and were a strong enough combination that Kirshner recruited them for his Screen Gems songwriting factory: They were assigned to the Monkees. Asked to come up with songs for a quartet openly modeled on the Beatles, they devised a twangy guitar line similar to the one for the “Paperback Writer” and wrote “Last Train to Clarksville,” a chart topper in 1966 based in part on Hart's mishearing of the Beatles hit (he thought Paul McCartney was singing “take the last train” near the end; McCartney was singing “paperback writer”). 

When Kirshner suggested a song with a girl's name in the title, they turned out “Valleri” and reached the top 5. For the show's theme song, a stroll outside was enough.

“Boyce began strumming his guitar and I joined in by snapping my fingers & making noises with my mouth that simulated an open & closed hi-hat cymbal,” Hart wrote in his memoir. “We had created the perfect recipe for inspiration and started singing about just what we were doing: ‘Walkin' down the street.'”

Fox News Digital gained rare access to Whiteman Air Force Base, where Col. Josh Wiitala and his crews revealed how seven bombers carried out the first combat use of America's 30,000-pound bunker busters on Iran's nuclear sites.

KNOB NOSTER, MO – Details from the longest large-scale B-2 bombing mission in history are only now coming into focus, as Fox News Digital gained rare access to Whiteman Air Force Base and the commanders who led Operation Midnight Hammer, striking Iran. 

In interviews on base, Col. Josh Wiitala and his crews described how 4,000 personnel worked in secrecy to send seven stealth bombers on a 30-hour mission into Iranian airspace — the first time America's 30,000-pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator was used in combat. They called the raid a flawless performance and offered vivid accounts of the strain, training and coordination required to pull it off.

""We have a low observable culture — everybody's working in secrecy to carry out the mission,"" Wiitala told Fox News Digital, speaking publicly for the first time since the June strikes. ""It was the entire team working together leveraging the lessons from years of exercises.""

While thousands supported the mission through maintenance, munitions, operations and medics, 14 of the ""several dozen"" pilots trained on the B-2 stealth bomber ultimately traveled to enemy territory to drop the 30,000-pound GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) on Iran's nuclear sites.

In deciding who went, Wiitala said he prioritized experience over everything else. ""This team had flown Red Flag after Red Flag, major exercise after major exercise,"" he said. ""I was watching the crews prepare, I was just thinking about how many repetitions they'd had, how long they'd trained for this. And it was a very seasoned crew.""

The colonel would not discuss specifics such as how much notice the crew was given, whether electronic warfare or other countermeasures were used, or measurable evidence for why commanders believed the bombs hit their intended targets. Those details remain classified, leaving outsiders to rely on satellite imagery and independent assessments for verification.

Wiitala said the team that was selected was ""fired up"" to carry out the mission. ""What I told them is, ‘I think this will be remembered as one of the most consequential raids of our lifetime.' They absolutely understood the historic nature of the mission.""

Pilots came home from the 30-hour mission ""completely exhausted,"" according to Wiitala — it was the longest mission for a large-scale bombing attack with seven planes. Each aircraft had two pilots, and they took turns resting for 45 minutes to an hour at a time, particularly in between complex aerial refuelings. Some carted cases of energy drinks on board to stay alert.

The longest combat mission for any airplane was 44.3 hours, when pilots struck al Qaeda and Taliban targets after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Rest periods consist of trying to get horizontal on the small patch of metal floor behind the pilot's seats.

OPERATION MIDNIGHT HAMMER: HISTORIC B-2 BOMBER MISSION FLEW FROM MISSOURI TO STRIKE IRANIAN NUCLEAR SITES

The aerial refueling, according to Wiitala, ""is the hardest stick and rudder, hand-flying piece of what we do."" The process consists of aligning as close as 10 feet below a KC-135, KC-10, or KC-46 tanker, where a hose and nozzle at the bottom of the plane attach to a fuel opening at the top of the B-2. The B-2 must fly parallel below the KC tanker for 15–30 minutes to take on a fuel load of up to 167,000 pounds.

Wiitala said the ""biggest moment"" of his 22-year career in the Air Force was when the pilots made it back safely. ""When I knew the crews were safe, when I knew that they were in friendly airspace and they were safe. That was the biggest thing for me. In terms of mission success, it was 14 weapons on target. Again, it was just flawless performance. So I was incredibly proud of how they executed, incredibly proud of the whole, you know, all 4,000 people here across our hundreds of specialties supporting this mission and making it work.""

The B-2 is the only long-range stealth aircraft that can carry the 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs. But the $2 billion plane is aging: 20 of them have been in operation for close to 30 years. Combined with rapidly evolving air defenses — drone swarms, long-range surface-to-air missiles and sensors — the B-2 was built for an earlier generation of air combat.

""We're constantly evolving how we employ the airplane,"" said Wiitala. ""It's still a very effective aircraft, but the B-21 is the next step.""

The B-21 is expected to be more cost-effective, under $1 billion per plane, and the Air Force plans to buy 175–200 of them.

The MOPs are stored on base along with 500-pound and 2,000-pound bombs. They are maintained to be ready for use at a moment's notice. Weapons loaders train for 21 days to become certified in maintaining and loading the 30,000-pound bombs, which lock into the body of the plane at two steel touchpoints, according to Chief Master Sgt. Frank Espinoza, 509th Maintenance Group wing weapons manager.

Those who handle the weapons train every month on loading the ordnance for flight missions. When dropped, the weapons penetrate deep into the ground before exploding. Iran's underground bunkers were the first combat targets for the weapons.

Fifteen years of testing and multiple iterations led to the combat-ready version of the MOP. The finalized version has now been tested for ""several years,"" according to Espinoza.

The bombs were dropped on targets across two Iranian nuclear facilities: 12 MOPs were dropped on the Fordow uranium enrichment plant, buried under 300 feet of rock, and two on the Natanz nuclear facility. Israeli airstrikes took out Iran's air defenses, creating a ripe opportunity for U.S. bombers to enter Iranian airspace at relatively lower risk.

A recent assessment from nuclear weapons expert David Albright and a team of researchers analyzing data from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found that after U.S. strikes, Iran has no path to produce weapons-grade uranium at any of its known centrifuge plants ""for the first time in 15 years.""

""The military attacks destroyed or made inoperative all of Iran's installed centrifuges — almost 22,000 gas centrifuges — at Iran's three enrichment sites,"" the analysis said. But the researchers noted it's unclear how long it would take for Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon, since the country may have other centrifuges not yet in use and not destroyed in the strikes.

President Donald Trump immediately proclaimed Iran's nuclear program had been ""completely and totally obliterated,"" though skeptics and opponents of the strikes voiced caution about declaring the mission a success before a final damage assessment was finished.

While Iran ceased cooperation with nuclear authorities as a result of the strike, its retaliation on U.S. military personnel has been muted. Tehran launched a strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, but notified both parties in advance. No one was injured in the counterstrikes.

Following their Week 1 loss to the Indianapolis Colts, the Miami Dolphins held a players-only meeting. Colin Cowherd discusses the culture in Miami and if the Dolphins can recover this season. 

The Miami Dolphins suffered a tough loss to the New England Patriots on Sunday as pressure ramped up on ownership to make a decision about their general manager and head coach.

Mike McDaniel's postgame press conference following the 33-27 defeat didn't exactly do much to inspire confidence among fans. He was asked about the team's failure to convert on fourth down on their final possession of the game.

""That's kind of where the frustration lies for me is it wasn't deciding that cost us, or a late play call, which that happens at times,"" McDaniel said. ""But this was not one of those times. I got the play call in, but I need to do a better job supervising the orchestration within our multiple personnel groups. 

""To win games, you have to win the game and not lose the game, honestly. And that is how you lose the game. You're moving the ball down the field, you're first-and-10 and then you find yourself at second-and-20. That was critical.

He later lamented the team failing to properly execute in critical situations. The Patriots' defense got to Tua Tagovailoa twice on the final drive and they committed a delay of game penalty.

The clever lines from McDaniel have fallen on deaf ears and the fans are growing more frustrated by the week. A plane flew over Hard Rock Stadium that called for the firings of McDaniel and general manager Chris Grier.

Miami's schedule isn't getting any easier either.

The Dolphins will play the Buffalo Bills on Thursday night with the New York Jets lurking around the corner. Miami could start 0-3 against divisional opponents.

McDaniel said he wasn't necessarily worried about his job security despite starting the season 0-2.

""I think if I worry about my job security, I won't be doing my job, and I think that inherently is against all things that I believe in,"" he said. ""I've never felt entitled to any sort of – I've never felt entitled to this position, and it's very important for me to spend all of my waking hours worrying about exactly how to do my job and all the residual effects of that are there's a lot of people affected.

The Philadelphia Eagles beat the Kansas City Chiefs 20-17 in a game that gave the Chiefs their first 0-2 record in over a decade. Colin Cowherd says that the Chiefs' dynasty is ""officially over"" and that the Eagles are simply the better team. 

Travis Kelce's frustrations boiled over on Sunday as the Kansas City Chiefs fell to the Philadelphia Eagles in a rematch of Super Bowl LIX.

The Kansas City Chiefs tight end was seen on the FOX broadcast telling his teammates in the second quarter that he was ""sick of this s---"" and slammed his helmet down on the field. The clip came after Patrick Mahomes scored on a rushing touchdown. It was unclear what Kelce was upset about.

The star tight end then suffered a crucial drop that led to an Eagles interception and, eventually, a touchdown on the next drive for the Jalen Hurts-led squad.

The Chiefs' quarterback fired a pass to Kelce as the tight end was cutting across the field. The ball was just to the right of Kelce and he was unable to make a play. The ball bounced out of his hands and into the hands of Eagles defender Andrew Mukuba.

Hurts led the Eagles on a 10-play, 59-yard drive from there and it ended with a touchdown. Philadelphia took a 10-point lead and won the game 20-17.

Kelce had four catches for 61 yards, leading the team.

Chiefs head coach Andy Reid talked about Kelce's emotions on the sidelines.

""He's trying to get guys fired up and going. I mean, that's him. He's that way every week if you keep an eye on him. He's all in, all the time. That's the way he was today,"" Reid said.

Mahomes talked about Kelce's drop.

""We got the defense that we wanted. We expect them to play that zero-zero with the hole player – with the safety,"" he said. ""I think I threw it just a tad too early, just trying to put it on his (Kelce's) body low before that hole player got there and I think if I can put it more on his body and not so far out in front of him then he can catch it, take the hit and get in the end zone.""

Kansas City dropped to 0-2 for the first time in the Mahomes era.

""I think just after the first few weeks now, you just let games slip away. We played two good football teams and made mistakes in big moments - stuff that we're not used to doing,"" Mahomes said. ""But I think we're coming together as a team, man. I mean, when you deal with adversity it's about how you deal with it and obviously, this isn't how we wanted to start. But how are we going to respond?

President Donald Trump doubled down on his demand that European nations cease all purchases from Russia as he mulls more sanctions.

President Donald Trump doubled down on his demand that European nations cease all energy purchases from Russia as he mulls his first sanctions on Moscow since re-entering office amid its war in Ukraine.

Speaking to reporters Sunday evening, Trump said European nations, especially those in NATO, are not doing enough to counter Russia, despite the new round of sanctions enacted by the EU last week. 

""They're not doing the job. NATO has to get together. Europe has to get together,"" Trump said. ""Europe… they're my friends, but they're buying oil from Russia, so we can't be expected to be the only ones that are, you know, full bore.""

TRUMP SAYS HE'S RUNNING OUT OF PATIENCE WITH PUTIN 'FAST' OVER UKRAINE CONFLICT NEGOTIATIONS

""Europe is buying oil from Russia. I don't want them to buy oil,"" he continued, noting that the sanctions Europe has issued on Russia and Russian officials ""are not tough enough.""

 ""I'm willing to do sanctions, but they're going to have to toughen up their sanctions commensurate with what I'm doing,"" Trump confirmed. 

While European nations have drastically cut their reliance on Moscow's oil following Russian President Vladimir Putin's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, they have not cut it off entirely – particularly nations like Hungary, Slovakia, France, Belgium and Spain, which are Europe's top importers of Russian energy. 

Hungary – whose president remains friendly with Putin despite being a NATO nation – is Europe's chief importer of Russian crude oil and pipeline gas, purchasing more than double any other European nation's Russian energy imports.

France, which is the second-largest European purchaser of Russian energy, continues to import liquefied natural gas (LNG), which has largely bypassed EU sanctions, in part due to long-standing legally binding commitments.

These agreements mean Paris has committed to ""take-or-pay"" contracts through the early 2030s or would face arbitration or penalties. Reporting suggests, however, that the LNG imports are not only slated for French consumption, but are also being passed on to third-party nations like Germany.

RUSSIA FIRES DRONES INTO POLAND DAYS AFTER TRUMP MEETING WITH NATO ALLY

Last month, the EU's Data Protection Authority confirmed that the bloc had imported nearly $5.2 billion worth of Russian LNG in the first half of 2025. 

Trump's comments came just one day after he sent a letter to NATO that said he is ""ready to do major sanctions on Russia when all NATO Nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all NATO nations stop buying oil from Russia,"" according to a post he made on Truth Social. 

But when asked on Sunday about his plans to hit Russia with additional U.S. sanctions – which have not been expanded since the Biden administration – he suggested Europe might need to stop all LNG imports as well.

The president claimed that all Russian imports are supposed to be barred at this time and said, ""The deal is, they're not supposed – whether it's natural gas or whether it's cigarettes, I don't care – they're not supposed to be buying from Russia.""

The president didn't expand on which deal he was referring to, and he didn't comment on the U.S.'s $2.1 billion worth of Russian imports it has purchased in the first five months of 2025, largely consisting of enriched uranium, palladium and fertilizers.

In addition, he called on NATO allies to hit China with ""50% to 100% tariffs"" that he said would be withdrawn only after the war in Ukraine concluded – a rate which is currently higher than the 30% tariffs Washington has slapped on Beijing, though which could significantly expand given Trump's recent threats to hit China with tariffs as high as 200%.

The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's questions regarding this reporting.

Retired FBI special agent Robin Dreeke weighs in on Tyler Robinson's online radicalization, rigid mindset and the FBI's transparent investigation into his alleged plot against Charlie Kirk on 'America's Newsroom.'

The 77th Primetime Emmy Awards steered clear of mentioning the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk on Sunday evening. 

Comedian Nate Bargatze, who hosted the event, along with celebrity presenters and award recipients, made no mention of the brutal murder of the Turning Point USA founder during the telecast. In a pre-show interview, Bargatze said he planned to avoid political topics during his hosting duties.

""I know there's heartbreaking stuff that's been happening right now, but I want this night to be an escape, and I think that's why I was brought on,"" he told Entertainment Weekly (EW) on Thursday.

The 31-year-old conservative activist was gunned down while hosting a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday. The suspect, Tyler Robinson, is accused of murdering Kirk with a hunting rifle while perched on a campus roof about 200 yards away from where the activist was speaking to hundreds of college students. Robinson is in custody. 

Bargatze, whose family-friendly, non-political stand-up content has made him one of the biggest names in comedy, told EW he would not stray from his image for the show.

""I think a lot of people are watching, I know they watch my stand-up for that reason, so I just don't wanna break that trust that I have in them, and just make the night be a fun night.""

He did mention the Kirk tragedy in the interview, calling it ""the saddest thing in the world,"" but indicated there were no last-minute changes to the awards show script to address the shooting.

Kirk and his family – his wife Erika and two young children – received an outpouring of love and support in the days after his death. 

Last Thursday night's NFL game between the Green Bay Packers and Washington Commanders featured a moment of silence in honor of Kirk before kickoff. The Tennessee Titans, Miami Dolphins, New York Jets, New Orleans Saints and Dallas Cowboys also held moments of silence in honor of Kirk.

Famous music artists like Coldplay and country music stars Morgan Wallen and Jason Aldean made tributes to Kirk during their recent concerts.

While the Emmys didn't include a tribute to Kirk, or feature anyone criticizing his conservative views, there were multiple political moments on the Emmys' red carpet and during the show. 

When receiving her award for best supporting actress in a comedy, ""Hacks"" star Hannah Einbinder concluded her speech by saying, ""F--- ICE and free Palestine!""

While onstage, Television Academy Board of Governors Chair Cris Abrego touted the power of storytelling in addressing divisions in the country. 

""At a time when division dominates the headlines, storytelling still has the power to unite us,"" he said. ""All of us in this room must continue to champion that power and wield it responsibly in moments like this. Neutrality is not enough. We must be voices for connection, inclusion and empathy because we know that culture doesn't come from the top down, it rises from the bottom up.""

In an interview with Variety on the Emmys red carpet, actor Javier Bardem talked about the keffiyeh scarf he was wearing to the event.

""Here I am today, denouncing the genocide in Gaza,"" he told reporter Marc Malkin on the red carpet. ""I am talking about the IAGS, the International Association of Genocide Scholars, who study thoroughly genocide and has declared it is a genocide. That's why we ask for a commercial and diplomatic blockade and also sanctions on Israel to stop the genocide. Free Palestine.""

President Trump discusses the state of the New York City mayoral race on 'Fox & Friends.' 

President Donald Trump says he was shocked by the key endorsement New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani landed this weekend.

Hours after Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York backed Mamdani, Trump took to social media early Monday to give the endorsement a big thumbs down. And the president suggested that federal funding for the nation's most populous city could be in jeopardy.

""Governor Kathy Hochul of New York has Endorsed the ‘""Liddle"" Communist,' Zohran Mamdani, running for Mayor of New York. This is a rather shocking development, and a very bad one for New York City,"" the president wrote on his Truth Social platform. 

Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist state lawmaker from the New York City borough of Queens, rocked the political world in June with his convincing win over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and nine other candidates to capture the Democratic Party's mayoral nomination in the nation's most populous city.

TRUMP REVEALS NEW NICKNAME FOR MAMDANI

Following Mamdani's primary victory, Trump immediately criticized him as a ""100% Communist Lunatic."" 

The president has continued to repeatedly deride Mamdani as a communist in the ensuing months, while warning that New York City would become ""a communist city"" if Mamdani wins November's mayoral election.

""I call him my little communist. He's my little communist mayor,"" Trump said of Mamdani during an extended studio interview Friday on Fox News' ""Fox and Friends."" 

Trump, in his social media post, also hinted at restricting federal funding for New York City if Mamdani wins November's mayoral election.

""How can such a thing happen? Washington will be watching this situation very closely. No reason to be sending good money after bad!"" the president said.

POLL POSITION: JUST HOW LARGE IS MAMDANI'S LEAD IN THE NYC MAYORAL RACE?

Mamdani proposes eliminating fares on New York City's vast bus system, making CUNY (City University of New York) ""tuition-free,"" freezing rents on municipal housing, offering ""free childcare"" for children up to age 5 and setting up government-run grocery stores.

But Mamdani, who was born in Uganda and would become New York City's first Muslim and first millennial mayor if elected, has denied being a communist.

Hochul, in her endorsement, wrote that ""New York City deserves a mayor who will stand up to Donald Trump and make life more affordable for New Yorkers. That's @ZohranKMamdani.""

The governor's endorsement, which came nearly three months after Mamdani's primary victory, is significant. It may help Mamdani secure the backing of other key members of the party's establishment. And it will likely put more pressure on two other top Democrats in New York State who are still withholding their backing of Mamdani — Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, the top two Democratic Party leaders in Congress.

Mamdani, in a statement, said he was ""grateful to the Governor for her support in unifying our party — as well as the work she's done standing up to President Trump, securing free lunch meals for our kids, and expanding access to childcare.""

CUOMO SHAKES UP CAMPAIGN IN BID TO TAKE DOWN MAMDANI

Mamdani is the clear frontrunner in the latest public opinion polls in the mayoral race in the Democrat-dominated city.

Mamdani holds large double-digit leads over Cuomo and the rest of the field in three surveys released over the past week.

Guardian Angels co-founder Curtis Sliwa, who for a second straight election is the Republican mayoral nominee in the Democrat-dominated city, was a distant third in the polls, with embattled incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who is running as an independent after deciding to skip the Democratic primary amid anemic polling, further down in fourth place.

Both Sliwa and Adams have repeatedly committed to staying in the race in recent weeks amid multiple reports that Trump's advisors floated administration roles for both mayoral hopefuls if they dropped out.

On Sunday, following a new report that Adams would drop out in the coming days, the mayor's spokesman fired back.

""Let me be perfectly clear: Any rumor or tweet suggesting Mayor Adams is stepping down this week is complete bulls---,"" spokesman Todd Shapiro wrote in a statement. ""These lies are being spread by desperate opponents who can't match the mayor's record, his campaign energy, or his support across this city.""

Vice President JD Vance will guest-host the Charlie Kirk Show on Monday, sitting in for the program after the assassination of his close friend.

Vance teased the talk show gig in a post on X that included a photo of his desk with a notepad and a microphone on top of it.

“Tomorrow, I will have the honor of hosting the Charlie Kirk Show. Please join me as I pay tribute to my friend,” Vance said.

The program will start at 12 p.m. and can be streamed on Rumble.

Vance and Kirk had a close relationship that stretched as far back as 2017, years before Vance had entered political office.

After Kirk was shot and killed at a college event in Utah earlier this week, Vance posted a eulogy on X that recounted some of those memories together.

Those included Kirk advising Vance on his successful Senate run in 2022, his support for Vance's family during the presidential transition, and their banter over religion.

Federal investigators say Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old man suspected of assassinating conservative activist Charlie Kirk, has been linked to the crime through a DNA match and a disturbing note recovered during the investigation.

FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed on Monday that Robinson's DNA was found on a screwdriver and a towel wrapped around the suspected murder weapon.

“I can report today that the DNA hits from the towel that was wrapped around the firearm and the DNA on the screwdriver are positively processed for the suspect in custody,” Patel said during an interview on Fox & Friends.

Robinson, who has refused to speak with law enforcement, is being held under “special watch” in Utah. Officials said he fled the scene after assassinating Kirk, 31, at Utah Valley University by jumping from a rooftop. He then ran through a wooded area into a nearby neighborhood, abandoning the towel-wrapped firearm along the way, authorities said.

A disturbing note allegedly tied to Robinson was also recovered during the investigation, which federal agents said may point to his political motives and could implicate others in aiding or failing to report the attack.

Utah officials said Robinson had developed a strong leftist ideology before allegedly killing Kirk. Investigators recovered bullets inscribed with some messages consistent with left-wing criticisms of conservatives, including one message that appeared to refer to Kirk as a “fascist.”

Appearing on Fox News shortly after Patel, Dan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent who is the FBI's deputy director, said agents are aggressively examining Robinson's network.

“If this was a larger effort, [if] there was any aiding and abetting … whether it be someone who knew the specifics and failed to report that … we are looking into that,” Bongino said. “We have a lot of technical capabilities. … We'll also be dropping a lot of paper, a lot of subpoenas out there to take a look to see if there was any extended network.”

Bongino said investigators are scouring Robinson's online footprint and communications for clues about ideological motives and coordination. Several people close to the suspect had raised concerns prior to the shooting. Additionally, several online users appeared to have predicted the day of the shooting, according to posts reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon, though it is not confirmed whether any of these accounts were privy to any assassination plans.

“There were people in his network, friends and family, who had stated that he had become more political,” Bongino said. “Some of his coworkers had stated that he had kind of detached himself when the topic of politics came up … leading us to believe that this ideology had infected him and had taken over.”

Despite criticism over Patel's premature social media post last week claiming a suspect was already in custody, a statement that was later walked back, Bongino defended the pace and outcome of the investigation.

“You know what? It wasn't perfect, but it should be,” he said. “We got our guy in 33 hours. … When everything settled down and I finally got a little bit of sleep last night, it hit me that Charlie's not here anymore, and that was tough for everyone.”

Formal criminal charges are expected to be filed against Robinson by Tuesday. Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray said in a statement that he expects those charges to be “consistent” with the preliminary charges Robinson was arrested on, which included aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, and obstruction of justice.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

LONDON — President Donald Trump will travel to the United Kingdom this week for a three-day state visit as the president navigates tense trade talks and war in Europe.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer extended the invitation to Trump on behalf of King Charles III during a February visit to the White House, marking the first “second” state visit invitation ever doled out to a foreign leader by the Crown. Trump's first state visit was in 2019, three years before the death of Queen Elizabeth II.

“He's a beautiful man, a wonderful man,” Trump told Starmer at the time. “Your country is a fantastic country, and it'll be our honor to be there.”

Though Trump and Starmer ostensibly occupy opposing ends of the political spectrum, the latter set the model other European leaders have successfully followed for engaging “Dear Donald,” as Starmer likes to call the president, during his second term: pile on the flattery.

Those efforts have yielded significant results. The U.K. was the first country to sign a trade deal with the United States after Trump announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs in April.

Furthermore, Starmer and other European executives have substantially shifted Trump's position on the war in Ukraine. On the campaign trail, Trump and his allies frequently criticized U.S. aid of Ukraine's defense efforts, but this summer saw Trump turn up the heat on Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his invasion, even if the president's efforts to bring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Putin to the negotiating table have stalled in recent weeks.

While Trump will meet with Starmer multiple times on this trip, stretching from Sept. 16 to 18, the prime minister will receive a royal assist in keeping the U.K. in Trump's good graces.

Famed British historian Sir Anthony Seldon notes that the Crown, though lacking much actual authority, can still flex the soft power necessary to maintain relations with a leader like Trump.

“Is there any leader anywhere in the world who has quite that same attraction to Donald Trump as the British monarch?” Seldon told Reuters. “Derided by many as antiquated and hopelessly out of date — it's the royal family and the monarchy which is attracting the most powerful person in the world.”

Charles won't be the only royal tasked with impressing the Trumps.

William and Catherine, the prince and princess of Wales, will greet the president and first lady Melania Trump upon their arrival in London and travel with the Trumps to Windsor Castle, the principal residence of the British monarchy for the past thousand years, on Wednesday.

There, Trump will be honored with a royal salute, simultaneously fired in Windsor and at the Tower of London, a joint U.S.-U.K. F-35 flyover, a private state lunch with the king and Queen Camilla, and a lavish state banquet in the evening.

As if that wasn't enough, Trump is expected to take part in a wreath-laying ceremony at the tomb of Queen Elizabeth II in Windsor and, on Wednesday, following meetings at Chequers with Starmer and his wife, Lady Victoria, take a personal trip through the Sir Winston Churchill archives. Trump has repeatedly pointed to Churchill as one of his greatest political influences and maintained a bust of the former British prime minister in the Oval Office throughout both of his terms in the White House.

Melania Trump will similarly receive personal attention from the queen and princess. While Trump is soaking up Churchill, Camilla will guide the first lady through a tour of Queen Mary's Dolls' House, before Melania joins Catherine for an event at Frogmore Gardens to visit with Scouts Association members.

Still, Trump's visit may feature more than a few hiccups. 

Sir Ed Davey, the leader of Britain's Liberal Democrats, has already announced plans to boycott Trump's banquet, based on America's support of Israel's war in Gaza, and the U.K.'s Stop Trump Coalition is planning a protest around Trump's arrival in London.

TRUMP'S SECOND-TERM CHINA POLICIES ARE CONFUSING ‘HAWKS' — AND BEIJING

“There is a clear and growing link between the international far right in the US and UK,” the group said in a statement. “Trump's politics have encouraged this resurgence of hate in both countries.”

“Starmer rolling out the red carpet for Trump sends a deeply dangerous message and does nothing to provide support to communities seeing a surge in racism in the UK. He is missing in action at a time when the UK needs strong leadership to face down the far right,” the coalition continued. “We're calling on everyone who opposes today's scenes to join us on Wednesday and say: not in our name. This protest isn't just about Trump — it's about what kind of country we want to be.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

While Democrats search for a national leader to rally behind, House and Senate Minority Leaders Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) are on the same page heading into a partisan spending battle and contentious elections this November.

The GOP has largely rallied behind President Donald Trump as the leader of the party, following his lead on everything from the “big, beautiful bill” to an upcoming government shutdown fight. Republicans have ridiculed Democrats for having “no leader” in the wake of the 2024 election, after former President Joe Biden withdrew from the race and former Vice President Kamala Harris has largely stepped out of the spotlight following her loss to Trump.

House and Senate Democrats are turning to their respective leaders and often finding themselves at odds with one another. 

But recently, Jeffries and Schumer have presented a unified front, especially when it comes to conversations on a short-term spending deal to keep the government open before funding runs out on Sept. 30. Leaving a meeting on Thursday, both Democratic leaders said they were “totally united” and in agreement on a spending deal that extracts healthcare concessions from the GOP. 

“House and Senate, Hakeem and I, are in total agreement: What the Republicans are proposing is not good enough for the American people and not good enough to get our votes,” Schumer said.

This is a different approach from what occurred during the last spending fight in March, in which Democrats found themselves in a civil war over Schumer's decision to help Republicans break the 60-vote filibuster to advance the last continuing resolution. 

Splitting from Jeffries and House Democrats on the continuing resolution raised questions about whether Schumer should remain the Senate party leader. 

Top Democrats, including Jeffries, refused to answer questions for days about Schumer's viability as a leader, while others said they disagreed with his decision but understood there were no good options. Many progressive lawmakers, however, vocally challenged Schumer's leadership. Some even raised the possibility that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) should primary him. 

However, this time around, Democrats are more united as the party argues it needs to fight back harder against the Trump administration, the executive orders and rescission requests of which have given Democrats no appetite to help Republicans. 

The Democratic leaders are also united, for now, when it comes to endorsing or not endorsing candidates.

New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has received endorsements from several Democratic leaders in and outside New York. But, notably, he has not received endorsements from Jeffries or Schumer.

When pressed by reporters on Sept. 8 on whether he would endorse Mamdani soon, Jeffries said, “I have more to say about the mayor's race when I have more to say about the mayor's race.” He also said he had no plans “at the moment” to chat with Mamdani again after meeting with him first in July and again in mid-August.

“Who said it's a difficult topic?” Jeffries asked when pressed further by reporters. “I choose to make endorsements when I choose to make endorsements, and that's what I'm gonna continue to do. And that's what I've done, for 12-plus years as a member of Congress, reelected every two years, consistently.” 

Schumer has also not endorsed Mamdani despite meeting with him on Sept. 9. He told reporters he had a “good meeting” with the mayoral candidate and “we're going to keep talking,” but he did not endorse him. 

Jeffries and Schumer have come under pressure from the party's progressive bloc to endorse the Democratic socialist, arguing that the Democrats should rally behind their candidate. But Mamdani has not appeared to feel slighted by the lack of an endorsement from the two Brooklyn natives, with his spokesperson speaking highly of Schumer in a statement to Politico. 

Eyes will be on Jeffries and Schumer to see whether they remain unified heading into the next two weeks. With a shutdown looming at the end of the month and a GOP trifecta, Democrats will likely face a barrage of messaging from Republicans pushing that Democrats will be to blame for any shutdown. 

“It seems Democrats may take the path of maximum resistance and try to shut the government down,” Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) said on Sept. 9. “It's not surprising, 'cause they're struggling, and they don't really have a message or a leader, and party registration is falling.” 

He said Republicans are willing to negotiate in “good faith,” but they have to “think responsibly about how to spend less money.” 

But the ultimate question of whether there's going to be a government shutdown at the end of the month is going to be up to the congressional Democrats.” 

DEMOCRATS DEMAND HEALTHCARE CONCESSIONS FOR VOTES ON GOVERNMENT FUNDING DEAL

Schumer is likely the one to face the most pressure compared to Jeffries, who has largely received the backing of his caucus. But many Democrats, including a few Republicans, are pushing for a bipartisan agreement to include extending the Obamacare premium tax credits in any continuing resolution.

Johnson's right flank is likely not to vote for any spending deal that includes the credits, and even other top Republicans like Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington (R-TX) have said they don't have a desire to extend them as is.

Last week, the Israeli Air Force struck a guest house in Qatar. At the time, both Qatar-based and Turkey-based Hamas leadership were meeting to discuss their response to the latest ceasefire proposal and Israeli demands that Hamas release hostages it seized on Oct. 7, 2023, ironically during a ceasefire.

Both Qatar and Turkey responded with outrage. Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al Thani demanded retaliation “from the whole region” against Israel. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, meanwhile, likened Israel to a terrorist state and declared, without a sense of irony given Turkey's occupation of portions of Cyprus, Syria, and Iraq, that “Israel is being governed with an expansionist mindset and is trying to maintain its stability by exporting instability.”

All pretense is gone. Qatar, a country that bankrolled Hamas before, during, and after the Oct. 7 massacre, is showing its true, antisemitic, hateful colors. As Iran appears on the verge of shedding its reactionary, rejectionist Islamic Republic, Turkey actively positions itself to take Tehran's place as the leader of the anti-Israel, anti-America bloc.

The opprobrium of Qatar and other Arab states juxtaposes sharply with the reaction of Doha and those states flocking to the emergency summit after Iran launched several missiles at Qatar's Al-Udeid Air Base on June 23, 2025. That attack met largely with silence or perhaps a few pro forma denunciations, but none of the vitriol.

While President Donald Trump might be annoyed at Israel both for the strike and for largely missing (the terrorists reportedly kept the cellphones the Israelis were tracing in a different room), by any subjective measure, he should be furious with the Qataris. Trump long ago demanded Hamas release its hostages, yet Qatar refuses to convey this demand without diluting it or throwing life rafts to Hamas.

Now, Qatar is rallying the region to the anti-Abraham Accords, seeking to create a bloc that could wield military might against Israel. Egypt is talking about an Arab NATO. Iraqi Prime Minister Muhammad Shia al Sudani last week called for a “military Islamic alliance” to confront the Israeli threat. Sudani told Al Jazeera, a television channel that a decade ago cheered terrorism against Iraqis, that “the Israeli aggression on Qatar is a shocking event and a violation of all international laws and norms” and that “the Israeli aggression … confirms the aggressive approach of the criminal Israeli government.” Al Jazeera did not ask, nor did Sudani offer, what then he might call Iraqi militias launching missiles and drones against Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Israel, or previous Iranian missile and drone attacks on Iraqi bases.

TRUMP TO TARGET ‘RADICAL-LEFT' GROUPS FUNDING VIOLENCE THAT LED TO CHARLIE KIRK'S DEATH

Trump should react to the Qatari-Turkish hate conference with moral clarity. He should end Qatar's valuable major non-NATO ally status and withdraw U.S. forces from Al Udeid. He should do so because Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim has plainly shown he cares more about hosting terrorists and eradicating the Jewish state than he does about Iran shooting missiles at U.S. forces on his territory. If Turkey, meanwhile, acts as a state sponsor of terrorism, the United States should designate it as such, NATO member or not.

Qatar may believe dispensing money widely will buy it immunity. Perhaps for some it does, but no amount of cash or public relations contracts can hide the reality that it is a regime that embraces rather than excises the terrorist rot within.

President Donald Trump revealed on Sunday night that various left-wing groups are “already” being investigated following the assassination of Charlie Kirk.

Trump made the remark while speaking to reporters in New Jersey, teasing an announcement to come on the inquiry.

“We'll be announcing. … They're already under major investigation. A lot of the people that you would traditionally say are on the Left — already under investigation,” the president said.

Trump was also asked if he would revoke visas for foreign nationals who have celebrated Kirk's death, to which the president said his administration was “looking at names.”

“We wouldn't celebrate if something happened on their side — and we don't. These are sick people. These are really deranged people,” he responded.

Kirk, a Trump ally and CEO of Turning Point USA, was shot and killed on Wednesday during a college event in Utah. A suspect, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, has been arrested and is facing murder, obstruction, and felony firearm charges.

Shortly after Kirk's death, Trump vowed to “find each and every one of those who contributed” to the assassination, as well as other political violence.

State and federal officials in Utah are also separately probing left-wing groups in the state to see if they had knowledge of Robinson's plans or if they gave material support to him afterward.

A motive for the assassination is still largely unknown, but it was revealed this weekend that Robinson's partner, with whom he was living at the time, identifies as transgender.

While Gov. Spencer Cox (R-UT) has said that the individual has been “very cooperative” with officials and was “shocked” by the killing of Kirk, a relative told Fox News on Sunday that Robinson's partner “hates conservatives and Christians” and may have had a strong influence on Robinson.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Trump administration hasn't fired them but won't let them do their jobs.

When she succeeded Anthony Fauci as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Jeanne Marrazzo felt that she'd landed “probably the most important infectious-disease job in the world,” she told me. After decades of working in academia, she now had the power to influence, nationwide, the science she knew best—overseeing 4,500 employees at a $6.5 billion institute, the second largest by budget at the National Institutes of Health, the world's largest public funder of biomedical research.



Marrazzo had been on the job for only a year and a half, however, when the Trump administration placed her on administrative leave. She lost access to the NIH campus and, at least through official channels, to her staff, she told me; she could no longer sign into her laptop or phone. On paper, she would remain NIAID's official director, but in practice she had been pushed out.



That was at the beginning of April. In a near instant, she went from days filled, morning 'til evening, with meetings, phone calls, and lively scientific discussions to “no structure,” she told me. The first month or two, she “was too stunned to do much” at all, she said, beyond wrestling with feelings of humiliation over the situation she'd been forced into.



Marrazzo isn't alone in purgatory. She is one of roughly 100 officials whom the Department of Health and Human Services placed on administrative leave—or sent to, as some of them call it, HHS's rubber room—in the winter or in spring, without explanation or a sense of when or how their status might change, according to a senior HHS official with direct knowledge of their circumstances. (Several of the HHS officials I spoke with requested anonymity to avoid retaliation from the Trump administration.)



Their status is distinct from that of many HHS employees who remain on leave as part of the administration's deferred resignation program (who will be out of their jobs at the end of September), or who were part of a reduction in workforce and are stuck in limbo as litigation stalls their termination. But together, all of these on-leave officials constitute a group of thousands, estimates Abigail André, the executive director of the Impact Project, which has been tracking federal workers' fates during President Donald Trump's second term.



Their sheer number suggests that the United States government has spent tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars since the start of April on idled health workers. “I'm being paid to not work,” Aryn Backus, a health-communications specialist with the CDC's now-dismantled Office on Smoking and Health who has been on leave for months as part of the contested reduction in workforce, told me. In some cases, federal officials are being paid a lot to not work. I spoke with nearly a dozen officials indefinitely stuck in the rubber room whose annual salaries range from about $150,000 to $400,000. (When reached over email, HHS Press Secretary Emily G. Hilliard declined to respond to my questions about officials who remain on administrative leave, citing a restraining order and providing no further context when asked.)



In the past, administrative leave from the federal government has generally been used as a designation employers can assign when allegations about an employee's performance or conduct have been raised. It has been known to drag out before—in some cases, for years, amid lengthy personnel investigations. But as a rule, prolonging administrative leave past a few days is regarded as “just not an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars,” one senior NIH official told me. And what's played out recently—leaving dozens of people on administrative leave for months, in the absence of alleged misconduct and without a clear path toward resolution—is unheard of, a senior NIH official who has been on administrative leave since the spring told me. In July, the Office of Personnel Management released new guidance, effective in 2026, that will limit administrative leave connected to workforce reassignment to 12 weeks. But it did not specify whether that time limit, which can be jointly waived by OPM and the Office of Management and Budget, would apply retroactively to officials who have been on leave for months already. (OPM and OMB did not respond to a request for comment.)



Firing federal employees is generally difficult, especially without clear cause. That stability minimizes turnover, even when administrations shift. But the Trump White House has used administrative leave as a workaround, seemingly as a way to select the individuals they are most eager to prune, officials told me. For many senior HHS officials, in particular, placement on administrative leave “was just a pretext to get us out of the office,” Emily Erbelding, the director of the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases at NIAID, who has been on administrative leave since April, told me. This way, as she sees it, the Trump administration wouldn't risk being sued for wrongful termination, but could nudge officials toward resigning on their own.



Once the department places officials on leave, its options are limited, the senior NIH official told me: It “can keep us, fire us illegally, or reassign us and have us quit.” So far it's mostly just ignored them. On March 4, all seven former members of the NIH's now-defunct Sexual and Gender Minority Research Office were put on administrative leave on vague terms: No potential reassignments were mentioned, and none of the officials have received correspondence from the agency or department since, two officials told me. A few weeks later, dozens of officials across HHS—many of them in leadership roles, including Marrazzo and the directors of several other institutes, divisions, and centers—were told that they would be put on leave, and that the department was proposing to reassign them, several officials told me. The notice also mentioned that the Indian Health Service was “a critical area of need.” At the end of August, a small number of those people received notice that they had been reassigned to a Health Resources and Services Administration position in Missouri, three officials told me. At least one of them chose to retire instead. But most of those who were sent the Indian Health Service letter received only a request for their CVs in the spring, and have heard nothing since.



These officials say they were never given an explanation for being put on leave. Many of them focused on topics that the administration has said it doesn't want to fund (infectious disease, HIV, sexual health, DEI, gender research) or led institutes that the administration or Republican members of Congress have proposed altering, eliminating, or consolidating. NIAID's leadership was especially hard-hit, and several officials I spoke with saw those leave placements as part of the administration's revenge campaign against the U.S.'s response to COVID, and the public-health experts who drove it, Fauci among them. (Fauci's wife, Christine Grady, was also among the NIH officials placed on administrative leave in April; she chose to retire.) In Erbelding's case, she told me she suspects that the administration may have singled her out in part because she led a division that had awarded funds to the Wuhan virology lab at the center of the controversial lab-leak theory on the pandemic's origins, which Trump and his allies have embraced as fact. NIAID had also been one of the institutes most vocally challenging the administration's funding cuts. Marrazzo knew she had a target on her back: As early as February, she told me, she stopped furnishing her office with personal items, anticipating that she'd soon have to port them home again. (Earlier this month, Marrazzo and Kathleen Neuzil, who once directed the NIH's Fogarty International Center and was placed on leave under similar circumstances as Marrazzo, sent whistleblower complaints to the Office of Special Counsel, accusing the Trump administration of illegally forcing them out of their jobs.)



Some officials, like Grady, have retired, while others, like Neuzil, have found positions outside of government and resigned. But the administration's actions have also made their particular job market tough, Aryn Backus told me. Universities have been stripped of funding; pharmaceutical companies are wary of the FDA's shifting regulatory landscape. All of the officials I spoke with told me they'd been actively seeking other employment for months, but had found few prospects. Multiple senior NIH officials also told me that the agency has made their job search harder. As employees, they still need approval from their supervisor to give talks, volunteer, or otherwise participate in events related to biomedical research. But some have struggled to get it, they told me. The clearest explanation they've received, from ethics officials who help manage such requests, is that Matt Memoli, the NIH's principal deputy director, to whom several of them still report, has insisted that the rubber-room officials submitting these requests have been reassigned and are no longer under his purview. “Leadership is not acknowledging that we report to them, so they are not responding or approving,” one of those officials told me.



In theory, some of these officials could still return to their jobs. Backus joked that she feels snared in a prolonged situationship with the federal government: “It's like waiting for my toxic ex to call.” But for now, she doesn't have a position to return to, because the administration eliminated the office she was part of. Others, like Marrazzo, don't see the appeal anymore. Running an institute at the NIH once meant deciding how to guide the country's investment in health research, based primarily on the needs of the public and on the merit of the projects being funded; that job functionally no longer exists, she said. And under politicized leadership at HHS, “going back there right now sounds awful,” the senior NIH official told me. “My worst nightmare.”



The occupants of the rubber room do recognize that their situation—paid leave—could be worse. Some told me they will not resign: If the Trump administration wants them out so badly, it must cut them. “I want to force them to come up with an exceptional reason why I'm not good enough to keep serving the American people,” one official told me. But being stuck in limbo also has costs. As a scientist who has now, for months, been unable to present at national conferences or publish scientific papers—the core products of research—“my self-esteem is in the dumpster,” that official said. And, multiple officials told me, their lawyers say that they don't have sufficient grounds to sue HHS over damages such as wrongful termination, unlike those who have been officially separated from their jobs.



Five and a half months in, Marrazzo is now filling her days with what productivity she can: traveling, speaking, job hunting—and far more reading, birding, and “thinking about next steps” than she has ever been accustomed to. It doesn't feel like enough. “I've never not worked,” she told me. “It feels like slacking.” And her status haunts her. She regularly encounters people who are surprised to learn that she is still on administrative leave: They assume that she resigned, or was fired by the administration. The NIH has appointed an acting director to lead NIAID in her absence; the institute's website currently lists her as the former director. She'll gently correct people who call her that; at the same time, “I don't know how to introduce myself,” she said. When she gives talks, she lists herself as the institute's director on her introduction slide, and appends an asterisk that notes that she's on leave. Officially, the title is still hers. But she is no longer quite sure what that means.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

One of the night's most unexpected winners made a case for sticking with it.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

When Jeff Hiller heard his name announced as this year's Emmy winner for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series—his first-ever nomination, for his role in HBO's Somebody Somewhere—he appeared stupefied. For a long moment, his face remained unchanged, failing to register the shock. But as Hiller got up from his seat and began walking up to the podium to accept the honor, his expression seemed to catch up with his emotions: He chuckled, stuck his tongue out, and widened his eyes, as if to wordlessly communicate what everyone around him seemed to be thinking: What on earth? Even two of Hiller's fellow nominees, Saturday Night Live's Bowen Yang and the Shrinking actor Michael Urie, held their faces in their hands in what looked like joyous disbelief.

Hiller's win, to put it generously, was considered to be a long shot. Ahead of tonight's ceremony, industry insiders widely surmised that Television Academy voters would go for a different first-time Emmy nominee—the 83-year-old Harrison Ford, who earned a nod for his role as the therapist Dr. Paul Rhoades in Shrinking. Ford is a Hollywood institution, the star of nostalgic blockbusters whose late-career turn toward television has been well received. Meanwhile, Hiller is a character actor known by a comparatively niche audience; as Joel, a queer Midwesterner wrestling with his faith in the bittersweet Somebody Somewhere, he played in a more subdued mode than his brassier fellow nominees, including Ike Barinholtz in The Studio and Ebon Moss-Bachrach in The Bear. Somebody Somewhere, too, is unlike much of the TV-comedy landscape: The series, which concluded last December, follows a woman in her 40s, Sam (Bridget Everett), at loose ends in her Kansas hometown after her sister's death. On paper, that doesn't sound especially titillating, which Hiller poked fun at in his speech: “I just want to say thank you to HBO for putting a show about sweaty, middle-aged people on the same network as the sexy teens of Euphoria,” he said, his voice quaking.

Although critically adored, Somebody Somewhere didn't quite hit mainstream resonance in its three seasons on air; before this year, it had also failed to capture the attention of the Emmy voters. Hiller himself recently told the Los Angeles Times that he ignored calls from his manager the day nominations were announced. The actor has also spoken openly about his decades-plus climb to be taken seriously in Hollywood, both in his cheeky memoir Actress of a Certain Age: My Twenty-Year Trail to Overnight Success and tonight, in his acceptance speech. For Hiller, continuing to work in the industry at all has been a hard-won prospect. Trembling as he clutched the award, he told the crowd: “I feel like I'm going to cry because for the past 25 years I've been like, ‘World, I want to be an actor.' And the world's like, ‘Maybe computers?'”

Hiller is hardly the first actor to profess surprise at an awards win. But what feels so meaningful about Hiller's win has everything to do with the themes that undergird Somebody Somewhere itself: the hard and rewarding work of fostering community, and the search for warmth in a world that's turning ever more toward coldness and isolation. While thanking his colleagues onstage, Hiller noted that with Somebody Somewhere, the writers had put together “a show about connecting and love in this time when compassion is seen as a weakness.” He lingered on the last word, letting it hover for a beat in the room.

For a show to steadfastly champion such virtues felt revelatory, as did its ensemble of actors who didn't fit Hollywood's usual expectations of age, sexuality, or body type. But Somebody Somewhere took its exploration of empathy further, tackling subjects not often given space to exist on-screen—like the lingering effects of grief and the challenge of sustaining friendships as you age. For the Television Academy to recognize Hiller's role in this show seems like a vote not just for a moving and intuitive performance, but also for earnestness.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

How Gen Z's parasocial relationship with Charlie Kirk explains his success.

Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot last week at a campus event in Utah, was a hero to a generation of young conservatives; last week, my colleague Christian Paz wrote about how he and his organization, Turning Point USA, redefined what politics and political media looked like for many in Gen Z.

I sat down with Christian to talk about that appeal for Vox's daily newsletter, Today, Explained. Our conversation is below, and you can also sign up for the newsletter here for more conversations like this.

Where did Charlie Kirk come from, as a figure in the conservative movement?

He came pretty much from nowhere. Around the time that he was 18, he decides that he wants to start a revitalized movement of conservatism. His idols were Rush Limbaugh, the radio host, and he was a believer in the old “lower taxes, smaller government”-style conservatism. Essentially, the way that a lot of people describe him is somebody who was unique in the talents he had in communicating and talking and connecting with people.

Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day. Sign up here.

You get to 2024 and he goes from being an outsider, somebody who's never ran for office before, who had no connections, to becoming friends with Donald Trump Jr. He becomes close to Tucker Carlson. He becomes close to the new Republican power center.

And that's part of the myth of him: somebody who is not college educated, somebody who started a movement by himself when people doubted that it would take off and slowly builds until it's more than 800 college chapters and millions of followers. They raised $100 million last year in the presidential election, and they were one of the groups responsible for the Get Out the Vote effort that Republicans used last year.

How did he connect with and then transform youth and Gen Z politics on the right?

A lot of what he did was old-fashioned retail politics: showing up to places, going to centers of liberal elitism and intellectualism, the places where it wasn't cool to be conservative, where it was weird to be a Republican. He embraced a personality of saying bombastic things, of sparking outrage, and cultivating that outrage and that anger to make an even bigger name for himself on college campuses.

What he was able to do was like, clip content well, share it widely, and then use that to found more chapters and grow the organization. And once you have people who are fans of you, who have clubs that they're starting at their schools, they form a sense of community, and they form a sense of not being alone anymore on a college campus. It's no longer that taboo to say certain things, or to say that you're a conservative, or to argue conservative positions. That builds a sense of, you know, social connection on campuses.

In that process, you make this a lifestyle, and I think that's the key here. He wasn't just building a political movement, he was becoming a lifestyle and a social and cultural identity, and that's what ends up transforming campuses and Gen Z in general. It becomes a fact of the culture. And once it becomes a fact of the culture, it becomes its own universe, and that's the big shift.

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

Why Charlie Kirk? What did he see about Gen Z that helped him achieve this?

The thing that defines Gen Z is how swingable they are, how open to taking in any perspective. Charlie Kirk saw that there was a countercultural response against the doctrine of the millennial era of liberal progressivism that everyone got used to, and assumed that Gen Z would easily hold onto. Gen Z ended up not simply adopting all those views and becoming much more idiosyncratic. He saw a way to feed it, a way to cultivate it, to offer those debating spaces that maybe weren't proliferating as much on college campuses.

The other thing that I think he understood is the specific nature of Gen Z, social media nativism, of being ready to immerse themselves into parasocial relationships. A whole generation gets their news or gets more informed through podcasters, through influencers. They interpret life around them based on shows or specific people, and not so much a shared sense of monoculture that we were used to in the past.

Whether you liked him or hated him, you grew to have some kind of a relationship with him, whether it was in disgust or in really liking what he was saying, seeing him not just as a political figure but as an influencer who talked about faith and religion and health and wellness. There were different aspects to what his messages were, and that made it connect with people much more intimately than any politician.

What do you think is misunderstood about what he was doing and what his legacy is going to look like?

He did say a lot of controversial, offensive, in many cases bigoted things, and that wasn't a disqualifying thing for the way that people consumed his content.

I think one of the things that was shocking for a lot of people is just how broad his reach was and, essentially, the cinematic universe he created, where so many stars in the conservative movement were connected into the fabric that he built. You could easily consume culture that was connected to Turning Point USA and Charlie Kirk without realizing it. And I think that's the factor that is really interesting. He wasn't just a political activist. He became a celebrity, he became an influencer. He became somebody who represented various aspects of people's lives.

﻿A century ago, cars remade America. Autonomous vehicles could do it again.

A century ago, a deluge of automobiles swept across the United States, upending city life in its wake. Pedestrian deaths surged. Streetcars, unable to navigate the choking traffic, collapsed. Car owners infuriated residents with their klaxons' ear-splitting awooogah!

Scrambling to accommodate the swarm of motor vehicles, local officials paved over green space, whittled down sidewalks to install parking, and criminalized jaywalking to banish pedestrians from their own streets. Generations of drivers grew accustomed to unfettered dominance of the road. America was remade in the automobile's image, degrading urban vibrancy and quality of life.

Today, the incipient rise of self-driving cars promises to bring the most tumultuous shift in transportation since cars first rumbled their way into the scene. Just a few years ago, driverless cars were a technological marvel available to a select few in San Francisco and Phoenix, but now, companies including Waymo, Tesla, and Zoox collectively transport hundreds of thousands of passengers weekly in autonomous vehicles (AVs) across expanding swaths of Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; and Las Vegas, with future service announced in a lengthening list of cities, including Dallas, New York City, Philadelphia, and Miami.

Ride-hail companies are getting in on the action, too: Uber recently signed a deal to deploy at least 20,000 robotaxis powered by the AV company Nuro's self-driving systems. As the transportation venture capitalist Reilly Brennan recently observed, a “stampede is afoot to autonomize rides.”

AVs offer some undeniable benefits: Unlike humans, they cannot drive drunk, distracted, or tired. They make car trips easier, less stressful, more frictionless — in a word, nicer. The growing availability of AVs is likely to make many people respond just as they would to any other improvement in a product or experience: They will use it more often.

But that could prove disastrous for cities, causing crushing congestion (not to mention widening the gulf between those happily ensconced in their AVs and those stuck in buses crawling through gridlock). This is not pure speculation: Over the last 15 years, the rise of ride-hail, a service similar to robotaxis, has increased total driving, thickened congestion, and undermined transit. Autonomous vehicles, which offer privacy and service consistency that ride-hail cannot, could turbocharge the number of cars on the road, making a mess of urban streets. (Waymo did not comment on the record for this story, and Zoox and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.)

AVs are coming, but they cannot just plug and play into our existing transportation networks. If cities don't update their rulebooks, they risk repeating the mistakes of the last century.

While many of the policies governing AV deployments are set by federal and state officials, municipal leaders should not sit on their hands when their public sphere stands on the verge of a tectonic transformation. Cities can — and must — act now to increase the odds that self-driven vehicles enrich urban life rather than undermine it. Even better, doing so will improve current residents' lives, no matter how long it takes AVs to scale.

Here are a few steps worth considering.

Today's robotaxi deployments are still quite modest. Waymo, for instance, operates only around 300 vehicles across all of Los Angeles County. For AVs to be universally available, fleets would need to expand by orders of magnitude, and the cost of self-driving technology would likely have to plunge (Waymo reported an operating loss of over $1 billion in the first quarter of this year).

If and when that happens, cities should brace for many, many more cars on their streets.

There are several reasons to expect this. First, lots of people freed from the stress and fatigue of driving will use a self-driven car to venture further for a meal or meeting, and they will also take trips they would have otherwise foregone. With human labor costs eliminated, deliveries are also likely to skyrocket. As Anthony Townsend, author of the book Ghost Road: Beyond the Driverless Car, warned, “imagine what happens when it essentially costs as much to send a package as it does to send a text message.”

Then there is the issue of “deadheading”: vehicles driving around empty en route to their next pickup, or while waiting to be summoned. It's already a problem with ride-hail: Researchers have found that Uber and Lyft vehicles are passengerless around 40 percent of the time.

Beyond the misery of worsened traffic jams, an AV-fueled spike in driving would increase air pollution; even if the entire AV fleet were electrified, electric cars shed particles from tires and brakes. They could also make bus trips agonizingly slow and unreliable (which is all the more reason for cities to install bus lanes as soon as possible).

An obvious solution is to follow New York City's congestion pricing model. Since January, cars entering Manhattan south of 60th Street on weekdays must pay a $9 fee during weekdays. In a matter of months, the policy has quickened traffic, quieted car noise, and reduced the number of automobiles on the road.

Cities could also consider mileage-based fees on both AVs and human-driven ride-hail cars that are not transporting any passengers, incentivizing them to minimize the use of traffic lanes while empty. Jinhua Zhao, a professor of cities and transportation at MIT, suggests going further by imposing ride-hail and robotaxi fees that inversely scale with the number of vehicle occupants, rewarding companies for pooling multiple trips in a single vehicle (and thereby reducing total driving).

There are myriad ways to design road use taxes that mitigate congestion. Once the policy is in place, it can always be adjusted later to keep street traffic moving.

AVs will transform our relationship with an unrelenting nuisance of American life: parking. A robotaxi does not need to find a parking spot after dropping off a passenger at their destination; it simply moves along to its next assignment (or plies the streets, waiting to be summoned). As self-driving cars replace human-powered ones, “the notion of parking will gradually evolve into the concept of stopping,” Zhao said.

That begs the question of where, exactly, all these AVs will stop.

“There isn't always an open curb space where an AV can do a pickup or dropoff,” said Alex Roy, an autonomous vehicle consultant who previously worked at the now-defunct self-driving company Argo.ai. “In that case, the AV is just going to stop in a traffic lane,” potentially obstructing traffic and endangering pedestrians. Given the risks, Roy said, “the AV company should at the outset ask the city where are optimal pickup or drop zones that would be least disruptive.”

At the moment, that is a question many city transportation departments would struggle to answer. Information about loading zones and time-based parking restrictions (e.g., no parking 4 pm to 6 pm) can be dated and incomplete. “It's very rare for a city to have a proper inventory of the curb,” said Robert Hampshire, who oversaw several federal grants supporting curbside management during his time as deputy assistant secretary of the Department of Transportation's Office of Research and Technology under President Joe Biden.

Creating a current, digital map of all curbs should be a top priority. Doing so can help cities now, too, because those with the ability to collect real-time information about curb use could reduce double parking while collecting revenue from delivery and ride-hail companies. Philadelphia, for instance, in 2022 piloted “smart loading zones” that vehicles could reserve through a smartphone app. It's an approach that can help manage today's delivery trucks as well as tomorrow's AVs.

As AVs proliferate, the demand for car storage will plummet. For cities where parking devours 40 percent or more of available street space, that is a thrilling opportunity. “You can drastically reduce the number of parking spots and reuse them for housing, parks, or any other purpose,” Zhao said.

That's all the more reason for cities to jettison archaic zoning policies known as parking minimums, which require new housing, retail, and other real estate projects to include a fixed number of parking spots. In recent years, dozens of cities, including Austin; Raleigh, North Carolina; and San Jose, California have already implemented reforms, like scrapping parking minimums, to reduce housing construction costs and encourage travel modes that are more space-efficient and less polluting than driving, like walking, biking, and public transit. Those reforms will also lay the groundwork for a smoother AV transition.

Municipal leaders could go further by charging a dynamic market rate for street parking, creating pickup and dropoff spots that AVs can use throughout the day. “Pricing is how you create availability,” said Jeffrey Tumlin, former director of transportation of the Municipal Transportation Agency of San Francisco, the city that has been ground zero for robotaxi deployments. “The right price for parking is the price that ensures 15 percent availability at all times of day.” Those spots can provide easy and safe places for self-driven cars to pull over when collecting or depositing a passenger, paying the city a fee for the privilege.

San Francisco has already experimented with dynamic parking pricing that adjusts to real-time demand. Even at peak times, a spot can be found for those willing to pay a premium to avoid the joyless ritual of circling the block for an opening (an activity that contributes to street traffic and produces emissions).

In the Bay Area, self-driven cars have sown confusion on public streets by interrupting emergency response vehicles, randomly freezing in intersections, and pulling over in no-stopping zones. Since the infractions are often brief and police officers are scarce, AV companies can get away with it. Tumlin said that limited enforcement has led AV companies to program their vehicles to simply ignore the law: “The AVs' business case says that it's best to do a pickup or dropoff in the bike lane or in traffic, rather than inconvenience the passenger by having to walk a block or two.”

Humans, of course, also routinely flout traffic laws. Cities should use technology to fine illegal maneuvers reliably, regardless of whether a person or an algorithm is at fault.

In many countries and US states, automatic cameras that identify cars running red lights or breaking the speed limit are common and effective; studies have repeatedly shown that the resulting fines deter recurrence, and that a healthy majority of urban residents support their deployment. Automatic enforcement could be particularly useful with autonomous vehicles, allowing public agencies to batch a company's infractions before issuing a bill. Raising the expected cost of breaking traffic laws would encourage AV developers to place a higher priority on obeying them.

At the moment, many cities can't employ automatic enforcement at all, because their state legislatures, wary of driver opposition, have strictly limited the use of cameras to issue citations. Loosening those restrictions should be a top priority for city officials lobbying their state capitols.

There is a world of difference between a city where self-driven cars number a few hundred and one where they run into the tens of thousands. As currently configured, city streets may be able to handle the former, but the latter invites disaster.

Autonomous vehicles might be universally available in a few years, as some believers predict (though such forecasts have been wrong before). Or maybe that moment is still 20, 30, or 40 years away.

But city leaders need not strive to become Nostradamus, speculating about the evolution of a technology whose future remains wildly uncertain. The problems posed by self-driving cars are not so different in kind from those created by conventional, human-operated ones — and cities that make judicious policy choices now will enhance urban life regardless of how quickly an autonomous future arrives. There is no need to wait, and every reason not to.

The year child malnutrition flipped, in one chart.

Something striking just happened in global nutrition: As of 2025, children worldwide are now more likely to be obese than underweight.

According to UNICEF's new Child Nutrition Report, about 9.4 percent of school-age kids (ages 5–19) are living with obesity, compared to 9.2 percent who are underweight. Twenty-five years ago, the gap was much wider: Nearly 13 percent of kids were underweight, while just 3 percent had obesity. Over time, those lines have converged and flipped.

It might feel odd to put obesity in the same bucket as underweight; one has long been seen as a problem of scarcity, the other of excess. But public health experts now define both as forms of malnutrition, which they describe in three dimensions: not enough food, too much of the wrong food, and hidden hunger from micronutrient deficiencies.

There's a silver lining in this crossover: Fewer kids are dangerously thin than two decades ago. That decline really matters, because being underweight can mean stunted height, impaired brain development, weak immunity, and in worst cases, a higher risk of death. So, the fact that those numbers are falling is genuine progress.

But it's overshadowed by how quickly obesity has surged, with 188 million children now living with it — though where it shows up most varies widely by region.

Obesity in children isn't just about size; it raises risks for Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and even certain cancers later in life. Starting so young makes the costs even higher. By 2035, being overweight and obesity are expected to drain more than $4 trillion a year globally — about 3 percent of the world's GDP.

UNICEF bases that 2025 crossover on projections from survey data through 2022, and while the precise year carries some uncertainty, the trend is clear. And it's still pointing upward; the report projects child obesity rates will continue to climb through 2030, especially in Latin America, the Middle East, and East Asia.

The shift aligns with the change in the kind of food environment today's kids are raised in. Supermarkets, schools, and corner stores are stocked with foods high in calories, added sugar, saturated fat, and salt. Think sodas, packaged snacks, instant noodles — the kind of products that are designed to be cheap, convenient, and irresistible. That's by design.

“Food companies are not social service or public health agencies; they are businesses with stockholders to please,” said Marion Nestle, a longtime scholar of food politics at New York University, over email. “Their job is to sell more of their products…regardless of the effects on health.” And unlike a generation ago, these foods are no longer confined to wealthy countries; they're now widely available in LMICs, and are increasingly displacing traditional diets.

Ultra-processed foods — the buzzword taking health circles by storm — tend to encompass such foods. A rare randomized trial at the US National Institutes of Health found that people on ultra-processed diets ate about 500 extra calories per day than those on minimally processed ones. Most other studies show associations between ultra-processed food intake and obesity or poor health, though they can't prove cause and effect.

But experts also debate about what counts as ultra-processed. The system used by the UN and many researchers to determine what qualifies as ultra-processed is too broad and sometimes lumps together very different foods. That's why critics like Nicola Guess say the category “borders on useless,” pointing out that it can group together things as different as Oreos, tofu, and homemade soup made with a bouillon cube.

Still, the debate over definition doesn't erase the broader finding: Diets heavy in these calorie-dense, heavily marketed products are consistently linked to worse health outcomes. “This is as close as you can get to a causal relationship [in public health],” said Rafael Pérez-Escamilla, a professor of public health nutrition at Yale University.

The other shift in the last 25 years is that kids today are far less active than even a generation ago. In global survey reports, more than 80 percent of adolescents fail to get the World Health Organization recommended hour of daily exercise — a sedentary shift that makes the impact of poor diets worse.

The result is a world where no region is untouched, but the picture looks very different depending on where you are. Richer countries like the US (21 percent), Chile (27 percent), and the UAE (21 percent) report strikingly high rates of childhood obesity. In some parts of the Pacific Islands, more than a third of children are obese, a trend linked to growing reliance on imported processed foods over traditional diets.

But this isn't universal. In sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, underweight is still more common.

That regional picture shows we're in a patchwork of progress and crisis. Some regions are still battling too little food, others too much of the wrong kind, and many face both at once.

The drivers of this flip are structural — pricing, marketing, food availability — and that's where the solutions are, too.

“Latin American countries are worried that obesity and its consequent chronic disease will bankrupt their health systems,” said Nestle. That concern has pushed governments to act faster than most. Chile's 2016 warning label law and ad-ban package cut purchases of sugary drinks and snacks, and Mexico this year banned junk food in public schools, reshaping choices for 34 million children. “Impact studies show that they work to a considerable extent,” Nestle added. The UK's soft drinks tax points in the same direction, pushing companies to reformulate beverages with less sugar.

By contrast, in the US, the Make America Healthy Again movement has delivered little beyond words. “The MAHA movement is all talk. … The policy document that came out a few days ago is essentially saying we'll have no regulations or policies, we'll only do research and voluntary guidelines,” said Barry Popkin, a longtime nutrition researcher at University of North Carolina. As Jess Craig reported previously for Vox, the Food and Drug Administration's proposed front-of-package labels are a far cry from the bold stop-sign warnings in Latin America — the kind of measures experts say actually change behavior.

Of course, no single law is going to reverse the obesity curve, and nearly every country has struggled to get a handle on it. But measures like warning labels, soda taxes, and marketing restrictions at least sketch out what a serious policy toolkit could look like.

The decline in underweight is worth celebrating. But the rise of obesity, now surpassing it, reframes what malnutrition means in the 21st century. Calories alone are no longer the main problem; it's the kind of calories children are consuming. We're now in a world where we've partly solved one old crisis, only to stumble into another created by our food system.

﻿Rural health care is in crisis. Telehealth can help.

Rural health care has been in crisis mode for decades, due to a wide range of issues from distance, to care, to provider shortages, and budget shortfalls. Rural residents may have to travel up to twice as far to access a hospital as those in urban areas. Staffing shortages mean that, even when they do arrive, they're less likely to find the correct specialist. The American Medical Association reported that about 65 percent of rural areas have a shortage of primary care physicians. The list goes on, and despite multiple grants or special designations meant to help close these gaps, the issues persist. The reality is that rural areas need a range of options to better serve their communities. One that's working right now is the use of telehealth to supplement care. The trouble is, telehealth is frequently overlooked and underfunded. But, if used correctly, proponents say it could be a game changer for rural communities — where about 20 percent of Americans live.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I met a woman who'd built her dream life on a farm in Ecuador. It pushed me to rethink mine.","https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-living-abroad-ecuador-slow-down-esmeraldas-latin-america-2025-9","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 00:14:00 GMT","

Esmeraldas is a jungle-lined coastal province in Ecuador shadowed by cautionary tales — its reputation for danger keeps some travelers away. Despite that, it was there that I received a well-timed reminder not to let ambitions stagnate.

Last month, I drove 11 hours to spend two weeks in a rural town on my friend's mom's land. I went partly out of curiosity about this beautiful coastal spot and partly because I was tired of routine and ready for a reset.

Shortly after I arrived, I stood inside the farmhouse and looked out at the scene around me. Banana leaves swayed lazily, and coffee trees stretched down the hill from the wooden house. Chickens peeped nearby as a neighbor rode past on horseback. 

My friend's mother, Carmen, now 59, grew up in this region and, after spending several decades abroad, returned to pursue her lifelong goal of running her own farm. Before coming back home to make that a reality, she had built a cleaning business in Australia.

Esmeraldas felt worlds away from Toronto, where I'd spent most of my 20s before leaving over seven years ago, when life there began to feel too fast-paced, predictable, and expensive. 

These days, I live in Ecuador, where nearly everything I'd heard about Esmeraldas, both the province and the city, painted it as dangerous.

""It's racism. It's not like that at all,"" my Ecuadorian-Australian friend told me one evening after a woman warned us not to go. 

After living and working in both Ecuador and Colombia, and traveling widely across Latin America, I've heard plenty of opinions about plenty of places.

When the invite came to visit Carmen's farm, I accepted. Two friends and I wound our way from Cuenca, where we live, down Ecuador's spaghetti-like mountain roads and toward a hot-pink coastal sunrise, ready to enjoy rural life and hit pause on work. 

On an overcast day, a few days in, Carmen led us through the property to hack at stubborn weeds while we gathered a small harvest: oranges, hot peppers, limes, and coconuts to quench our thirst. Just days earlier, she had asked me, ""Sinead, are you todo terreno — an all-terrain person?""

""I think so?"" I'd replied, confused.

I soon found out that in Esmeraldas, Carmen is all about two things: being todo terreno and wielding her machete. Both fit the landscape perfectly.

In her kitchen, she came even more alive. A breeze drifted in as she ground yucca to make palm-sized bread stuffed with cheese, pepper, onion, and garlic, a recipe she used to make with her grandmother. When I bit into the bread, fresh from the oven, it was perfect.

I was witnessing a decadeslong goal fulfilled through persistence and hard work.

Everything I experienced — from the bread to mornings with coffee, from admiring the hills to her impressive home-cooked lobster — was the result of years of effort. She had shaped her career with the aim of one day returning to Esmeraldas. She cleared the land, built her wooden dream house, and planted yucca, coffee, cacao, and a rainbow of fruits.

""I always knew I'd get here one day,"" she told me as she effortlessly peeled the skin off an orange in one perfect spiral. 

What, I wondered, is my version of a treehouse-like home? 

For now, my plan is to stay in Latin America, capture the magic of places like Esmeraldas in my writing, and tend to my creativity the way Carmen tends to her land.

Two weeks later, I walked out of the jungle with clarity on my own path, knowing that the blank page shouldn't be any more intimidating than Carmen's once tree-covered patch of earth she transformed into home.

Business Insider Edition 

Russia seeks to fully penetrate the African market through the Russian Industrial Zone in Egypt, according to the Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Alexey Overchuk.


        On the 14th of September, 2025, a Russian delegation led by Russian Deputy PM, Alexey Overchuk, arrived in Egypt to further strengthen the bilateral ties between both countries.
    


        DON'T MISS THIS: ""The worst has passed,"" Egypt's Prime Minister assures his people



        A key focus of his visit was the Russian Industrial Zone, a large-scale industrial development project that Russia and Egypt agreed to establish inside the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZone) at East Port Said.
    


        Following his visit, the Russian Deputy Prime Minister indicated that the project would serve as a suitable entry point to the broader African continent, as seen on EADaily.
    


        ""A number of countries are already present in this zone and are developing their sites. The site is conveniently located near the seaport of Ain Sokhna, as well as regarding railways and highways...
    


        We believe that the Russian industrial zone will become a convenient entry point for our business both to Egypt itself and to the African continent,"" Alexey Overchuk stated.
    


        Representatives of business groups and Russian businesspeople who were interested in working in the Russian industrial zone were part of the delegation led by Alexey Overchuk.
    


        ""The Egyptians will talk about the advantages of their economic zone... There will be an acquaintance with the zone itself, working conditions, benefits for residents of the zone, the readiness of the infrastructure, and businesses will build their plans for this,” he stated.
    


        “Therefore, at this stage, it is very important that businesses go there, take a look, evaluate their capabilities, and measure them with their own investment plans,"" the Russian Deputy Prime Minister added.
    


        Moscow has chosen a company to run the Russian industrial zone, according to the Deputy Prime Minister.
    


        ""For our part, we have generally decided on the operator of the Russian industrial zone from our side. This is a group with extensive experience in creating an industrial zone in Russia and is able to work on attracting residents,"" Overchuk stated.
    


        The Russian Deputy Prime Minister noted that the trip to the Egyptian economic zone would enable a joint evaluation of its potential, according to Sputnik.
    


        The benefits that the Egyptians will offer to the zone's inhabitants include favorable working conditions, adequate infrastructure, and incentives for investment.
    


        In June, Russia's plan to open a new consulate in the Egyptian Red Sea resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh was reported, following a decision by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin to go ahead with the plans. 
    


        In the same month, it was also announced that Russia had achieved a new world grain export record by shipping more than 10 million tons of wheat to Egypt in 2024.
    


        “Russia is the largest exporter of wheat to Egypt and delivered more than ten million tons there last year. This is an unprecedented figure because no other country in the world has purchased grain in such volumes, and Russia has not sold this much wheat to any other country,” the Russian Ambassador to Cairo, Georgy Borisenko, stated.
    


        In August, Russia officially recognized Egypt as its principal African trade and economic partner.
    


        The Russian Foreign Ministry reported that bilateral trade exceeded $9 billion in 2024, underscoring Egypt's crucial role in Moscow's continental engagement.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Companies from Delta to Office Depot are disciplining employees for their public comments on Charlie Kirk's death","https://www.businessinsider.com/charlie-kirk-microsoft-nasdaq-delta-office-depot-employees-public-comments-2025-9","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 17:05:00 GMT","

In the days since Charlie Kirk's death, some companies have been forced to navigate a delicate situation: employees sharing their personal views about the conservative activist in public.

For employers, those remarks highlight the growing challenge of balancing free expression with corporate values and workplace harmony.

Major corporations such as Microsoft and Delta Air Lines are taking action against employees who have made social media posts critical of Kirk's own views, or even ones celebrating his death, which could be considered a violation of company values.

Kirk, an ally of President Donald Trump, advocated conservative beliefs on college campuses and was influential among young people on the right. But many find his comments about immigrants, trans rights, and feminism intolerant and divisive.

Here is how some companies are responding.

Microsoft shared an X post on Friday addressing negative remarks about Kirk made online by some of its employees.

""We're aware of the views expressed by a small subset of our employees regarding recent events,"" the company said. ""We take matters like this very seriously and we are currently reviewing each individual situation.""

Microsoft said, ""Comments celebrating violence against anyone are unacceptable and do not align with our values.""

Microsoft's statement came after Tesla CEO Elon Musk called out Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on X in response to an unverified claim that some employees at Blizzard, a video game company owned by Microsoft, had posted comments ""trashing"" Kirk.

The ODP Corporation, the parent company of Office Depot, apologized to consumers on Friday after footage taken at a Michigan Office Depot gained attention on social media. The footage appeared to show an employee refusing to print a poster for a vigil associated with Kirk.

""The behavior displayed by our associate is completely unacceptable and insensitive, violates our company policies, and does not reflect the values we uphold at Office Depot. On behalf of the Company, we sincerely apologize for this regrettable situation,"" the company said in a press release.

The company said it fired the employee involved in the interaction.

""We also launched an immediate internal review and, as a result, the associate involved is no longer with the organization,"" the press release said. ""We continue to aggressively investigate the matter and will take action where appropriate.""

A spokesperson told Business Insider that Office Depot was continuing to ""closely manage"" its response to the interaction.

On Friday, Nasdaq said it fired an employee for their remarks about Kirk because they violated company policy.

""We are aware of social media posts by an employee regarding the shooting of Charlie Kirk that were a clear violation of our policy. Nasdaq has a zero-tolerance policy toward violence and any commentary that condones or celebrates violence,"" the company said on X. ""The employee in question has been terminated, effective immediately.""

The political analyst Matthew Dowd was widely attacked online after making remarks about Kirk during an appearance on MSNBC's ""Katy Tur Reports"" on Wednesday.

MSNBC's president, Rebecca Kutler, called Dowd's comments ""insensitive"" in an X post later that day.

""During our breaking news coverage of the shooting of Charlie Kirk, Matthew Dowd made comments that were inappropriate, insensitive, and unacceptable,"" the statement said. ""We apologize for his statements, as has he. There is no place for violence in America, political or otherwise.""

Dowd responded in a subsequent Substack article on Friday, confirming that MSNBC had fired him.

""The Right Wing media mob ginned up, went after me on a plethora of platforms, and MSNBC reacted to that mob,"" he wrote. ""Even though most at MSNBC knew my words were being misconstrued, the timing of my words forgotten (remember I said this before anyone knew Kirk was a target), and that I apologized for any miscommunication on my part, I was terminated by the end of the day.""

Comcast and Versant executives urged employees to ""treat people with kindness"" in a memo on Friday. Comcast is MSNBC's parent company. Versant is an independent media company being spun off from Comcast and NBCUniversal that will eventually own MSNBC.

""Regardless of whether you agreed with his political views, his words and actions underscore the urgency to maintain a respectful exchange of ideas — a principle we must champion,"" the memo said.

The memo added: ""As employees, we ask you to embody our values in your work and communities. We should engage with respect, listen, and treat people with kindness.""

Perkins Coie, a law firm already at odds with the Trump administration, didn't escape the fray either.

The firm fired a lawyer whose social media posts about Kirk gained attention online, where commentators noted his place of work, according to The Wall Street Journal.

""This is not who we are, and we have separated the individual from Perkins Coie,"" the law firm told the outlet.

On Thursday, the Carolina Panthers addressed comments from one of its employees, writing on X, ""The views expressed by our employees are their own and do not represent those of the Carolina Panthers.""

""We do not condone violence of any kind. We are taking this matter very seriously and have accordingly addressed it with the individual,"" the post said.

A source told The Athletic the organization fired a public relations employee over his remarks about Kirk.

Delta Air Lines suspended an unknown number of employees over their social media posts about Kirk, a companywide memo viewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution showed.

Delta CEO Ed Bastian wrote in the memo that those employees were under investigation because the content ""went well beyond healthy, respectful debate,"" according to the AJC.

He added, ""Violations of our social media policy can carry meaningful consequences, including termination.""

Karen Attiah said she was fired as an opinion writer from The Washington Post after posting on social media about Charlie Kirk.

Attiah wrote a Substack post published Monday that said she was fired after ""speaking out against political violence, racial double standards, and America's apathy toward guns.""

A Washington Post spokesperson said the paper doesn't comment on personnel matters. The Post's social media policy says in part that Post journalists should not undermine the paper's ability to cover the news fairly and should be civil and treat people with respect.

The day Kirk was shot, Attiah said in a Bluesky post that there was a double standard in how the shooting deaths of Democrats were treated and a failure to address ""white men"" who commit violence. Attiah wrote a post mentioning Kirk that said the left was prematurely being blamed for his death. Another of her posts referred to not doing performative mourning for ""a white man that espoused violence.""

It is not clear what particular social-media posts led to Attiah's firing.

Attiah's departure comes in the wake of the Jeff Bezos-owned Post's overhaul of its opinion section, which is now focused on ""personal liberties and free markets."" That led to the departure of opinion editor David Shipley, along with several of his colleagues, and the appointment of Adam O'Neal to replace him in June.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Another NATO State Says It Deployed F-16s to Intercept a Russian Drone","https://www.businessinsider.com/romania-nato-country-f16-russian-drone-very-close-2025-9","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 04:34:00 GMT","

Romania is the second NATO country in the last week to report a Russian drone incursion, as the alliance remains on edge over a wave of airspace violations reported by Poland several days ago.

""Today, the Romanian Air Force intercepted a Russian drone violating our national airspace,"" wrote Romania's defense minister, Ionut Mosteanu, in a statement on Sunday.

""Two F-16s from the 86th Air Base scrambled and tracked it until it disappeared near Chilia Veche. The population was never in danger,"" Mosteanu added.

The minister later said on local TV that the F-16 Fighting Falcons were ""very close"" to shooting down the Russian drone, which Mosteanu said was flying low but eventually exited Romanian airspace.

The drone was detected while Romanian forces were monitoring the northern border on Saturday evening, amid a Russian attack on nearby Ukrainian infrastructure, Mosteanu said.

The country's defense ministry said the drone flew in Romanian airspace for about 50 minutes and that the F-16 pilots, who were on patrol and then deployed to meet the threat, had been authorized to shoot it down.

But the drone headed back to Ukraine, leaving near the town of Pardina in northern Dobruja close to the Black Sea, per the ministry.

""Romania condemns Russia's reckless behavior, which threatens regional stability,"" Mosteanu's statement said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a statement on Saturday about Romania's reported incursion, said that the Russian drone had ""penetrated about 10 kilometers,"" or six miles, into NATO airspace.

Russia's main arsenal of long-range drones consists mostly of the Geran, a locally produced version of the explosive-packed Iranian Shahed drone, and the Gerbera, a decoy version.

Romania has said it has dealt with such incursions before, scrambling fighter jets several times over the years after Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022. Some were reported as having crashed inside Romania.

But Saturday's incident comes as NATO has been on high alert since Poland said on Wednesday that it had detected at least 19 Russian drones entering its airspace. That act has been widely interpreted in the West as an attempt to probe the alliance's readiness, cohesion, and response to aggression.

NATO fighter jets, including Dutch F-35s and Polish F-16s, scrambled to confront the drones, shooting down at least three.

The incursions in Poland happened while Russia was conducting one of its large-scale attacks on Ukraine, and the Kremlin has denied deliberately flying drones into Polish airspace. However, it hasn't acknowledged if its drones entered NATO airspace.

In response to Romania's incursion report, Russia's ambassador to Romania, Vladimir Lipayev, said Bucharest's complaint was a ""provocation by the Kyiv regime.""

""In the absence of objective confirmation of the nationality of the aircraft, the protest was rejected as far-fetched and unfounded,"" he told Russian state media outlet TASS.

Kaja Kallas, the European Union's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, condemned the reported breach in Romania as ""reckless escalation"" by Moscow.

""The violation of Romanian airspace by Russian drones is yet another unacceptable breach of an EU Member State's sovereignty,"" she said in a statement on Sunday.

In February, Romania passed a law that gave its forces the authority to shoot down or destroy Russian drones illegally entering its airspace.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I landed a job at an AI startup right out of college. Here's what you should do if you want to work in AI.","https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-get-job-ai-startup-google-internships-tips-tech-2025-9","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 00:00:00 GMT","

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Lambert Liu, a software engineer. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his employment and academic history.

For most computer science graduates, it's a no-brainer to work for Big Tech.

Most of my classmates were drawn to Big Tech companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon because they promised prestige, stability, and a structured career path.

But I found myself falling into a second group of college students, one that actively seeks job opportunities at startups for the steep learning opportunities and potential equity upside if the startup goes public.

I reached that decision after doing internships in both Big Tech and startups.

I did two internships at Google during my sophomore and junior years in college.

When I interned at Google for the first time, I really liked it. But when I went back for a second round, I thought my growth there was plateauing. I didn't see myself working there in the long term.

At the end of my junior year, I did an internship at Replit, an AI software development startup. That experience was refreshing because I got to lead impactful projects. I realized I wanted to work at a startup, and that led me to my first job at Graphite, an AI code review platform.

Here are the top tips I have if you want to land a job at an AI startup.

If you are like me and want to give startups a shot after interning only at Big Tech, don't worry. You don't need past internship experiences at startups to work at one.

Interning at a Big Tech company helps demonstrate to employers that you have a strong overall technical foundation. You will know how to do great technical design and great testing. Your stint with Big Tech tells recruiters that you are capable of writing clean code and shipping reliably.

It's good to have startup experience because you will be more used to dealing with ambiguity and thinking quickly on your feet. But that can be easily solved by working on your own personal projects, which takes me to my next point.

I personally worked on a lot of passion projects in my downtime when I was not working. Working on those projects not only developed my skills, but it also helped strengthen my approach toward solving problems.

In fact, those projects do not have to be AI-related. You can use AI tools to amplify your productivity as an engineer, but you should not limit yourself to just working on AI projects.

Building AI projects also isn't a prerequisite to working in an AI startup. They generally look for great engineers, and whether you build projects with AI or not, there are many ways to demonstrate your thinking and technical skills.

Solving algorithmic and coding problems on LeetCode, an online learning platform, still matters when you are preparing for technical interviews at startups.

That said, there's a lot more emphasis on one's ability to deal with ambiguity and tackle non-technical areas like product thinking. This is especially the case since every engineer can use AI to write code.

Working on your own projects will help you strengthen your problem-solving skills. Having to build something new forces you to develop your perspective and taste for approaching problems, which will help you better handle the interview.

My job interview at Graphite was the first time I was ever asked about system design. That is not usually asked of new graduates. When it comes to system design, companies assess not only your technical skills but also your approach to problems.

I learned a lot about system design thinking when I took a course on human-computer interaction in college. I learned how to scope problems and then build a technical foundation to solve them. The course also gave me some hands-on experience when I built a project.

Foundational courses like algorithms and data science are important, but going into areas like human-computer interaction will be useful when you start interviewing.

If you want to excel at a startup, you must strive to be a holistic engineer above all else. You need to work at a fast pace. And on top of that, you have to show that you really care about your users.

You can start doing that now when you are interning. Show your bosses that you really care about your craft and want to make the best possible product.

Take ownership of your work as much as possible. At AI startups like Graphite, we move fast, so we are looking for hires who can cope with that velocity and produce high-quality work.

Congressional Budget Office director Phillip Swagel said Monday that President Donald Trump's tariffs appear to have pushed inflation up higher than CBO analysts had initially expected. 

His views differ from those of Wall Street analysts, many of whom have been bracing for tariff-driven price hikes, but have yet to see them in materialize. 

Speaking on CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" Swagel said the CBO analysis shows the economy has weakened since January, which he would expect to exert downward pressure on inflation.

Swagel also shared his office's long-term view of the impact of Trump's tariffs: The CBO expects the levies to reduce the U.S. budget deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade by pouring money into the federal coffers.

""So $3.3 trillion of revenue and then $700 billion of averted debt costs,"" he said. ""That would be a big reversal in terms of the deficit.""

Trump's tariffs face an uncertain future. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in early November, after the Trump administration appealed lower court rulings that found the president had exceeded his authority. 

Swagel said that the outcome of the Supreme Court tariff case is ""one of the key uncertainties in the economy.""

But that uncertainty is likely to fade over time, according to the CBO's latest report.

""The effects of policy uncertainty dissipate over time and disappear by the end of 2027, returning investment to what it would have been without the uncertainty in trade policy,"" the September CBO analysis said.

Alphabet has joined the $3 trillion club.

Shares of the search giant jumped more than 4% on Monday, pushing the company into territory occupied only by Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple.

The stock got a big lift in early September from an antitrust ruling by a judge, whose penalties came in lighter than shareholders feared. The U.S. Department of Justice wanted Google to be forced to divest its Chrome browser, and last year a district court ruled that the company held an illegal monopoly in search and related advertising.

But Judge Amit Mehta decided against the most severe consequences proposed by the DOJ, which sent shares soaring to a record. After the big rally, President Donald Trump congratulated the company and called it ""a very good day.""

Alphabet shares are now up more than 30% this year, compared with the 15% gain for the Nasdaq.

The $3 trillion milestone comes roughly 20 years after Google's IPO and a little more than 10 years after the creation of Alphabet as a holding company, with Google its prime subsidiary.

CEO Sundar Pichai was named CEO of Alphabet in 2019, succeeding co-founder Larry Page. Pichai's latest challenge has been the surge of new competition due to the rise of artificial intelligence, which the company has had to manage through while also fending off an aggressive set of regulators in the U.S. and Europe.

The rise of Perplexity and OpenAI ended up helping Google land the recent favorable antitrust ruling. The company's hopes of becoming a major artificial intelligence player largely ride with Gemini, Google's flagship suite of AI models.

In this article

Tesla shares jumped after CEO Elon Musk disclosed Monday his first purchase of the stock in the open market since February 2020.

Musk bought 2.57 million shares at various prices Friday which tallies up to about $1 billion, a significant insider acquisition that traders took as a vote of confidence from the outspoken CEO.

Tesla shares were higher by about 6% on Monday morning. They closed Friday slightly lower for 2025 despite a recent rally, with the stock up more than 25% over the last three months.

These kinds of purchases are rare for Musk with him last buying about 200,000 shares worth around $10 million on Feb. 14, 2020, according to Verity data. It's his largest purchase ever by value, according to Verity.

The electric vehicle maker earlier this month said it would ask shareholders to approve a new pay package for Musk that could be worth up to $975 billion based on various ambitious milestones. Before the purchases Friday, Musk owned around 13% of Tesla.

Tesla shares this year have been weighed down by slumping sales partly tied to Musk's political activities hurting the brand, along with the end of certain incentives for electric vehicles by the Trump administration.

Analysts are torn on the stock with the consensus price target on Wall Street calling for about a 20% decline from here, according to Tipranks.com. Though many are optimistic over the long term if Musk can pull off a transformation of the company to focus more on autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and robotics. The CEO wants shareholders to approve an investment by Tesla into his latest company, xAI.

The insider purchase ""is a huge sign of confidence for Tesla bulls and shows Musk is doubling down on his Tesla A.I. bet,"" said Dan Ives, global head of tech research at Wedbush.

The pay package shareholders will vote on in November has an ultimate goalpost of an $8.5 trillion market value. The stock was worth $1.3 trillion at Friday's close.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Tesla shares jumped 6% in premarket trading this morning after CEO Elon Musk disclosed his first purchase of the electric vehicle maker's stock on the open market in more than five years. Musk's haul of more than 2.5 million shares equates to around $1 billion.

Here's what else we're following:

There's more breaking news this morning: China's market regulator said in a preliminary probe that Nvidia violated anti-monopoly law when it acquired Mellanox.

China's State Administration for Market Regulation on Monday did not specify how Nvidia allegedly broke the country's anti-monopoly laws. The SAMR opened an investigation into Nvidia's 2020 acquisition of the Israeli tech firm last year. China approved the deal at the time, but with some stipulations, CNBC's Arjun Kharpal notes.

Nvidia shares slid about 2% before the bell.

Last week, Oracle became the latest public beneficiary of OpenAI's spending spree.

Oracle thrilled investors with surging cloud growth projections, fueled in large part by expected spending from OpenAI. Shares of Oracle climbed more than 25% last week, marking its biggest weekly gain since 1999.

As CNBC's Mackenzie Sigalos reports, this is part of a larger trend in the tech world. Oracle, Broadcom, Microsoft and Nvidia — four companies with ties to OpenAI — have seen their combined market caps grow by more than $4.5 trillion since the AI company burst onto the scene in 2022. However, some analysts are wary of OpenAI's outsized influence on the sector.

The tides might be turning in the breakfast business. Data shows that morning meal traffic is rising at a far faster clip at convenience stores than it is at fast-food chains, CNBC's Amelia Lucas reports.

That comes as regional chains like Wawa and Casey's General Store invest in their food-service offerings. Breakfast traffic can also buoy sales for these businesses as demand for staples like gasoline and tobacco slides.

Swiss watchmaker Swatch isn't taking President Donald Trump's tariffs sitting down. 

In a special edition watch it calls the ""WHAT IF...TARIFFS?"" model, Swatch swapped the position of the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock markers in reference to Trump's 39% levy on the European country. A spokesperson told CNBC that Swatch will ""immediately stop"" selling the watch if the U.S. changes its tariff policy. The watch is only available for purchase in Switzerland.

It's a vastly different tariff response than the one taken by fellow Swiss watchmaker Rolex. The company's CEO, Jean-Frederic Dufour, appeared alongside Trump in Rolex's midcourt box at the U.S. Open earlier this month.

Shares of UnitedHealth Group have surged nearly 30% since Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a stake in the insurer last month. In CNBC's Buffett Watch newsletter, Alex Crippen dives into the stock's performance and what it means for Berkshire.

In a sweeping interview last week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman addressed a plethora of moral and ethical questions regarding his company and the popular ChatGPT AI model.  

""Look, I don't sleep that well at night. There's a lot of stuff that I feel a lot of weight on, but probably nothing more than the fact that every day, hundreds of millions of people talk to our model,"" Altman told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in a nearly hour-long interview. 

""I don't actually worry about us getting the big moral decisions wrong,"" Altman said, though he admitted ""maybe we will get those wrong too."" 

Rather, he said he loses the most sleep over the ""very small decisions"" on model behavior, which can ultimately have big repercussions.

These decisions tend to center around the ethics that inform ChatGPT, and what questions the chatbot does and doesn't answer. Here's an outline of some of those moral and ethical dilemmas that appear to be keeping Altman awake at night.

According to Altman, the most difficult issue the company is grappling with recently is how ChatGPT approaches suicide, in light of a lawsuit from a family who blamed the chatbot for their teenage son's suicide.

The CEO said that out of the thousands of people who commit suicide each week, many of them could possibly have been talking to ChatGPT in the lead-up.

""They probably talked about [suicide], and we probably didn't save their lives,"" Altman said candidly. ""Maybe we could have said something better. Maybe we could have been more proactive. Maybe we could have provided a little bit better advice about, hey, you need to get this help."" 

Last month, the parents of Adam Raine filed a product liability and wrongful death suit against OpenAI after their son died by suicide at age 16. In the lawsuit, the family said that ""ChatGPT actively helped Adam explore suicide methods.""

Soon after, in a blog post titled ""Helping people when they need it most,"" OpenAI detailed plans to address ChatGPT's shortcomings when handling ""sensitive situations,"" and said it would keep improving its technology to protect people who are at their most vulnerable. 

Another large topic broached in the sit-down interview was the ethics and morals that inform ChatGPT and its stewards. 

While Altman described the base model of ChatGPT as trained on the collective experience, knowledge and learnings of humanity, he said that OpenAI must then align certain behaviors of the chatbot and decide what questions it won't answer. 

""This is a really hard problem. We have a lot of users now, and they come from very different life perspectives... But on the whole, I have been pleasantly surprised with the model's ability to learn and apply a moral framework."" 

When pressed on how certain model specifications are decided, Altman said the company had consulted ""hundreds of moral philosophers and people who thought about ethics of technology and systems.""

An example he gave of a model specification made was that ChatGPT will avoid answering questions on how to make biological weapons if prompted by users.

""There are clear examples of where society has an interest that is in significant tension with user freedom,"" Altman said, though he added the company ""won't get everything right, and also needs the input of the world"" to help make these decisions.

Another big discussion topic was the concept of user privacy regarding chatbots, with Carlson arguing that generative AI could be used for ""totalitarian control.""

In response, Altman said one piece of policy he has been pushing for in Washington is ""AI privilege,"" which refers to the idea that anything a user says to a chatbot should be completely confidential. 

""When you talk to a doctor about your health or a lawyer about your legal problems, the government cannot get that information, right?... I think we should have the same concept for AI."" 

According to Altman, that would allow users to consult AI chatbots about their medical history and legal problems, among other things. Currently, U.S. officials can subpoena the company for user data, he added.

""I think I feel optimistic that we can get the government to understand the importance of this,"" he said. 

Asked by Carlson if ChatGPT would be used by the military to harm humans, Altman didn't provide a direct answer.

""I don't know the way that people in the military use ChatGPT today... but I suspect there's a lot of people in the military talking to ChatGPT for advice.""

Later, he added that he wasn't sure ""exactly how to feel about that.""

OpenAI was one of the AI companies that received a $200 million contract from the U.S. Department of Defense to put generative AI to work for the U.S. military. The firm said in a blog post that it would provide the U.S. government access to custom AI models for national security, support and product roadmap information.

Carlson, in his interview, predicted that on its current trajectory, generative AI and by extension, Sam Altman, could amass more power than any other person, going so far as to call ChatGPT a ""religion.""

In response, Altman said he used to worry a lot about the concentration of power that could result from generative AI, but he now believes that AI will result in ""a huge up leveling"" of all people. 

""What's happening now is tons of people use ChatGPT and other chatbots, and they're all more capable. They're all kind of doing more. They're all able to achieve more, start new businesses, come up with new knowledge, and that feels pretty good.""

However, the CEO said he thinks AI will eliminate many jobs that exist today, especially in the short-term.

In this article

China's market regulator on Monday said that Nvidia violated the country's anti-monopoly law, according to a preliminary probe, adding that Beijing would continue its investigation into the U.S. chip giant.

Shares of Nvidia were down around 2% in premarket trading.

Late last year, China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) opened an investigation into Nvidia in relation to the acquisition of Mellanox and some agreements made during the acquisition. Nvidia acquired the Israeli technology company that creates network solutions for data centers and servers in 2020, in a deal that was approved by China at the time with certain conditions.

In a preliminary investigation, the SAMR said Nvidia had violated China's anti-monopoly laws in relation to that acquisition and its conditions. China's market regulator did not specify how Nvidia allegedly breached the country's laws.

""We comply with the law in all respects,"" an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. ""We will continue to cooperate with all relevant government agencies as they evaluate the impact of export controls on competition in the commercial markets.""  

The update from the SAMR has the potential to complicate trade talks between Chinese and U.S. officials that began on Sunday in Madrid, Spain.

Tensions between Beijing and Washington appear to be on the rise on the technology front. China opened two separate probes into semiconductors on Saturday: one is an anti-dumping investigation into certain chips imported from the U.S., while the other is an anti-discrimination scrutiny of U.S. restrictions on China's chip industry.

Nvidia has had a tumultuous relationship with the Chinese market in recent months, as the company has been caught up in geopolitical volatility. Earlier this year, Nvidia's H20 product, a chip that had been specially designed to comply with U.S. export restrictions, was blocked from being sent to China.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly called for American firms to be allowed to sell to China, saying the local artificial intelligence market will likely reach about $50 billion in the next two to three years. Huang said that, if American companies aren't present in China, domestic players like Huawei will fill the void.

That lobbying appeared to work. Last month, Nvidia cut a deal with Washington that would allow the tech giant to resume chip sales to China in exchange for giving up 15% of that revenue to the U.S. government.

Huang and the U.S. government have been discussing the possibility of exporting a more advanced chip to China.

Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor involved in criminal cases against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, sued the Department of Justice on Monday to get her job back after she was fired from the Trump administration in July.

Comey, a daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, received no explanation for her ""unlawful and unconstitutional"" termination, her attorneys wrote in the lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan.

""In truth, there is no legitimate explanation,"" they wrote.

""Rather, Defendants fired Ms. Comey solely or substantially because her father is former FBI Director James B. Comey, or because of her perceived political affiliation and beliefs, or both.""

The lawsuit names the Department of Justice, the Executive Office of the President and their respective leaders as defendants, along with the Office of Personnel Management and the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys.

The Justice Department and Comey's lawyers did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment on the suit.

Comey is the latest among dozens of DOJ employees who have turned to the courts after being terminated during Trump's second term. 

Comey, like a number of other ousted government officials, had been targeted by Laura Loomer, a far-right activist who has taken credit for influencing the Trump administration to fire people.

After Comey was fired in mid-July, Loomer boasted that the move followed ""my pressure campaign on [Attorney General Pam Bondi] to fire Comey's daughter and Comey's son in law from the DOJ.""

Comey's husband, Lucas Isaacharoff, ""voluntarily resigned"" from the DOJ in May, according to the lawsuit.

Following her ouster, Comey warned that she was being made an example of in order to quell potential dissent within the DOJ.

""If a career prosecutor can be fired without reason, fear may seep into the decisions of those who remain,"" Comey wrote in a farewell note to staff at the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office.

""Fear is the tool of a tyrant, wielded to suppress independent thought. Instead of fear, let this moment fuel the fire that already burns in the heart of this place,"" she wrote. ""A fire of righteous indignation at abuses of power. Of commitment to seek justice for victims.""

France's borrowing costs ticked higher on Monday as traders reacted to Fitch's decision Friday to downgrade the country's credit rating amid ongoing uncertainty over the country's political leadership.

Fitch downgraded France's credit rating from 'AA-' to 'A+' with a stable outlook, citing a ""high and rising debt ratio"" and warning that ""political fragmentation"" was hindering fiscal consolidation.

On Monday morning, the yield on France's benchmark 10-year government bond initially moved 7 basis points higher to 3.5132% at 7.40 a.m. London time, whereas the yield on the 30-year bond, or OATs as they're called in France, rose 8 basis points to 4.3351%.



Both yields have since retreated in early deals, and were broadly flat around 9:13 a.m. London time, perhaps reflecting the fact that credit rating downgrades were expected in the days after the collapse of former Prime Minister Francois Bayrou's government on Monday following a confidence vote.

Cognisant of the wary and weary eyes of investors — who have followed more than a year of tumult in French politics amid stark disagreements about the 2026 budget — French President Emmanuel Macron quickly elected a new prime minister, France's fifth in less than two years.

Whether his ally, former Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu, will fare any better as PM remains to be seen, with analysts predicting he will face the same opposition to spending cuts and tax rises (Bayrou had targeted 44 billion euros, or $51.5 billion, worth of cuts), necessary to reduce France's budget deficit.

There was no honeymoon period for Lecornu, with protests erupting on the day he was sworn in as PM, and more union-backed demonstrations due this week, with major disruption expected on Thursday.

For its part, Fitch projected that France's fiscal deficit would stand at 5.5% of gross domestic product in 2025, down from 5.8% of GDP in 2024, but warned this was still high compared with the projected euro zone median deficit of 2.7%.

In addition, Fitch forecast that French debt would increase to 121% of GDP in 2027 from 113.2% in 2024, ""without a clear horizon for debt stabilisation in subsequent years.""

Worrying for France, Fitch's latest appraisal of France's credit-worthiness was the first of several rating reviews on the horizon. Moody's is due to announce its latest review of the risks associated with investing in the nation's debt on Oct. 24, and Standard and Poor's (S&P) is expected on Nov. 28.

Analysts note that while Fitch's downgrade was largely priced into French debt markets, future downgrades are expected.

""French sovereign bonds have been trading at spreads to swap rates consistent with multiple downgrades,"" analysts at ING said in a note Monday.

""It is no surprise then that French debt and the euro have not reacted too much to Friday evening's decision by Fitch to downgrade France one notch to A+. Locally, the focus is on how quickly, if at all, new French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu can focus the minds of a disparate National Assembly on the unpopular but essential path of fiscal consolidation,"" they added.

One of Lecornu's first moves has been to abandon plans to eliminate two public holidays, ING noted, as the new PM tries to dispel some of the political wrath targeted at his predecessor's proposal — just one part of Bayrou's unpopular cost-cutting plans.

ING told investors to expect foreign exchange market players to keep one eye on French debt, though it caveated that with its ""core view ... that this is not going to broaden into another euro zone crisis.""

U.S. and Chinese trade negotiations concluded in Spain Monday, after two days of talks on several sticking points ranging from tariff rates, export controls and the imminent deadline for a divestment of Chinese-owned TikTok.

Talks on trade were overshadowed by a ""framework"" deal regarding the social media platform, announced by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Monday.

""It's between two private parties, but the commercial terms have been agreed upon,"" he said from U.S.-China talks in Madrid. Both President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet Friday to discuss the terms.

The news comes ahead of a Wednesday deadline to either divest TikTok's U.S. business or shut down the social media app in the country.

Bessent led negotiations alongside Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on the U.S. side, with the Chinese represented by Vice Premier He Lifeng and top trade negotiator Li Chenggang.

There were no major developments in trade discussions, however, with Greer saying talks on ""those kinds of things"" had been ""deferred"" to another time. ""We were very focused on TikTok,"" he added.

The meetings in Madrid mark the fourth round of bilateral meetings in four months, after both sides reached an agreement in May to pause most of the steep tariffs and walk back some of their mutual restrictions. A trip to Washington by Chinese senior trade negotiator Li Chenggang last month yielded little progress.

Tensions between the countries have ramped up in recent days. Over the weekend, China launched two investigations targeting the U.S. semiconductor industry, including an anti-dumping probe relating to certain American-made analog IC chips, along with an anti-discrimination investigation into U.S. moves against the Chinese chip sector.

The investigations were kicked off after the U.S. added 23 more China-based companies to its entity list last Friday.

On Monday, China's market regulator said that a preliminary investigation found Nvidia was in violation of the country's anti-competition laws, adding that a further probe into the U.S. chip giant will be carried out.

After the end of the talks Monday, Bessent described the Nvidia investigation announcement as ""poor timing.""

Nvidia has become ""a leverage for both sides,"" with the extended probe as ""clearly part of negotiation tactics run by Beijing to show its tough side to Washington,"" said George Chen, partner of digital practice at business advisory The Asia Group.

The barbs exchanged ahead of the Madrid rapprochement were ""not encouraging,"" said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade representative and head of the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington, adding that China was ""going to drive a hard bargain"" in Trump's second mandate and likely demand some compensation in exchange for lifting these new measures.

Cutler pointed out that Beijing had managed to get Washington to remove certain controls on exports of tech equipment to China, after it tightened exports of critical minerals and magnets to the U.S.

""With this approach, [it's] hard to see how the bilateral economic relationship improves. More like running to [a] stand-still,"" Cutler said.

Separately, China's Ministry of Commerce in a statement pushed back against Trump's request for the European Union to impose secondary tariffs of up to 100% on China over the country's purchases of Russian oil.

This was ""a classic act of unilateral bullying and economic coercion"" and ""a severe violation of the consensus reached"" during a call between Trump and Xi earlier this year, a spokesperson for the ministry said in the statement, vowing to take ""any necessary measure"" to defend Beijing's legitimate interests.

Officials were also expected to discuss details of a potential face-to-face meeting between Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping later this year. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that Beijing has for the past two months sought to broker a Trump visit to China, what would be the U.S. president's first state visit to the country after a trip in 2017.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he would call a national emergency and federalize Washington, D.C. after Mayor Muriel Bowser said its police would not cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

At issue is the provision of information on individuals living in, or entering, the United States illegally. Trump's threat adds to a move critics have seen as federal overreach, with more than 2,000 troops patrolling the city.

The comments come after several thousand protesters hit the streets this month over Trump's August deployment of National Guard troops to ""re-establish law, order, and public safety,"" after calling crime a blight on the capital.

""In just a few weeks. The ""place"" is absolutely booming... for the first time in decades, virtually NO CRIME,"" Trump said on Truth Social.

Bowser's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump's post.

Earlier he had put the metropolitan police department under direct federal control and sent federal law enforcement, including members of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to police the streets. It is unclear when their mission will end.

Trump blamed ""Radical Left Democrats"" for pressuring Bowser to inform the government about the non-cooperation with ICE, adding that if the police halted cooperation with ICE, ""Crime would come roaring back.""

He added, ""To the people and businesses of Washington, D.C., DON'T WORRY, I AM WITH YOU, AND WON'T ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN. I'll call a National Emergency, and Federalize, if necessary!!!""

Bowser, who has previously praised Trump's surge of federal law enforcement, bringing a sharp decline in crime, earlier signed an order for the city to coordinate with federal law enforcement.

The National Guard serves as a militia answering to the governors of the 50 states, except when called into federal service. The D.C. National Guard reports directly to the president.

In this article

After Swedish payments group Klarna's $17 billion initial public offering, investors are pondering which big fintech name will be the next to go public.

Klarna popped as much as 30% on the day of its New York IPO, before settling to close around 15% higher. The stock declined further to $42.92 by Friday but is still up about 7% from its IPO price of $40.

The debut demonstrated how Wall Street is becoming more welcoming of bumper fintech listings. Prior to Klarna, online trading platform eToro, stablecoin issuer Circle and crypto exchange Bullish all went public to a positive first-day reception.

Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, surged 14% in its IPO Friday.

""I think the Klarna IPO would be viewed positively by some of the other scaled-up vendors,"" Gautam Pillai, head of fintech research at British investment bank Peel Hunt, told CNBC.

There's a crowded pipeline of fintech names that could be next to IPO after Klarna. CNBC looks at which companies look the most promising.

Digital payments firm Stripe has for years been viewed as an IPO contender. Stripe has remained a private company in the 15 years since it was founded, and founders and brothers John and Patrick Collison have long resisted pressure to take the business public.

However, that doesn't mean a stock market listing hasn't been on Stripe's mind. The Collisons told employees in 2023 that Stripe would decide to either go public or allow employees to sell shares via a secondary offering within the next year.

Ultimately, Stripe in January opted for a secondary share sale valuing the company at $91.5 billion — close to its peak valuation of $95 billion, which it achieved in 2021.

That doesn't mean Stripe couldn't still pursue a stock market debut further down the line. Many fintech unicorn CEOs have been keeping a close eye on Klarna's IPO performance for signs of when will be the right moment to list.

Revolut is widely seen as a potential future fintech IPO candidate. The digital banking unicorn told CNBC last week that it recently gave employees the chance to sell shares on the secondary market at a whopping $75 billion valuation, placing it above some major U.K. banks by market value.

""As part of our commitment to our employees, we regularly provide opportunities for them to gain liquidity,"" a Revolut spokesperson told CNBC at the time. ""An employee secondary share sale is currently in process, and we won't be commenting further until it is complete.""

The secondary round buys Revolut some time to remain private for longer while still offering staff the chance to exit some of their holdings. At the same time, though, it now makes Revolut one of the world's most valuable private fintech firms.

As to where Revolut lists, for now the U.S. appears the likeliest location.

Co-founder and CEO Nikolay Storonsky has spoken candidly about his preference to list in the U.S. due to issues with London's IPO market. Last year, he told the 20VC podcast that it was ""just not rational"" to go public in the U.K.

Having recently reached a $5.9 billion valuation in a secondary share sale, British digital bank Monzo is another contender for the public markets.

A report surfaced earlier this year from Sky News that said Monzo had lined up bankers to work on an IPO that could take place as early as the first half of 2026.

However, in a fireside discussion moderated by CNBC at SXSW London, Monzo CEO TS Anil said that an IPO is ""not the thing we're focused on right now"" — it's worth noting though that this was back in June.

""The thing we're focused on is scale the business, continue to grow it, double it again, reach more customers, build more products, continue to drive great economic outcomes on the back of that,"" Anil said at the time.

Anil wouldn't comment on where Monzo would list if it were to IPO, but he stressed the firm was ""deeply committed"" to being globally headquartered in London. 

Monzo's rival neobank Starling Bank has reportedly been considering an initial public offering in the U.S. as part of expansion plans there.

On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that Starling had hired Jody Bhagat, former president of global banking at software firm Personetics Technologies, to lead the growth of its Engine technology unit in the U.S.

Starling declined to comment when asked by CNBC about its listing plans.

Last year, Starling's CEO Raman Bhatia talked up the bank's plans to expand globally via Engine, a software platform that Starling sells to other companies so they can set up their own digital banks.

""I am very bullish about this approach around internationalization of what is the best of Starling — the proprietary tech,"" Bhatia said during a fireside chat at the Money 20/20 conference moderated by CNBC.

Starling was last privately valued at £2.5 billion ($3.4 billion) in a 2022 funding round. However, reports indicate the firm is looking to fetch a valuation of £4 billion in an upcoming secondary share sale.

Though a lesser known name, Bulgaria-founded fintech firm Payhawk also has IPO ambitions.

The spend management platform was valued at $1 billion in 2022 and saw revenue surge 85% year-over-year in 2024 to 23.4 million euros ($27.4 million).

""We're definitely seeing the IPO window open,"" Payhawk CEO and co-founder Hristo Borisov told CNBC in an interview earlier this month. However, he stressed that ""we are looking at more of a five-year horizon there.""

""If you look at the majority of the IPOs, the majority of those IPOs are companies with $400 million to $500 million-plus ARR [annual recurring revenue],"" Borisov said. ""That's our goal.""

There are other fintechs that look like potential IPO contenders further down the line — but the trajectory looks less clear.

Blockchain firm Ripple's CEO Brad Garlinghouse told CNBC in January last year that the company explored markets outside the U.S. for its IPO due to an aggressive crypto enforcement regime under ex-Securities and Exchange Commission chief Gary Gensler.

That could change now thanks to President Donald Trump's pro-crypto stance. Garlinghouse said last year though that Ripple had put any plans for an IPO on hold. The startup was most recently valued at $15 billion.

Germany's N26 is another potential IPO contender. The digital bank was valued at $9 billion in a 2021 funding round.

However, it has faced some setbacks. N26 co-founder Valentin Stalf recently stepped down as CEO after facing pressure from investors over regulatory failings.

Strategy (MSTR) said Monday it purchased another 525 BTC for $60.2 million, bringing the company's total holdings to 638,985 BTC, according to an SEC filing.

The latest acquisition was made at an average price of $114,562 per bitcoin, raising the firm's overall average purchase price to the same level.

The announcement came as bitcoin slipped in European trading, falling from nearly $117,000 to about $115,000.

So far in 2025, MSTR shares have underperformed bitcoin, gaining just 11% compared with bitcoin's 23% rise.

MSTR shares were trading at $330 per share in pre-market on Monday.

Oops, something went wrong

Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, unveiled its smallest Bitcoin purchase in a month on Monday, scooping up 525 Bitcoin worth $60 million, according to a press release.

The Tysons, Virginia-based firm now owns roughly 639,000 Bitcoin worth $73 billion. The company's latest acquisition was funded entirely with proceeds from preferred shares.

The Bitcoin-buying firm often issues common shares to grow its stockpile, while taking advantage of the premium that its stock trades at relative to its Bitcoin holdings. In recent weeks, however, the company's approach to funding has been varied.

Last month, Strategy announced back-to-back Bitcoin purchases that weren't funded with proceeds from issuing common shares. Over the period, it bought 585 Bitcoin worth $67 million, with one week representing its lightest activity since late March.

Strategy, notably, did not go all-in on Bitcoin last week. Although the company raised around $68.2 million through its STRF, STRC, and STRD offerings, the company only spent $60.2 million on Bitcoin, leaving it with around $8 million in extra cash.

Strategy's stock price fell 2% to $325 on Monday, according to Yahoo Finance. Bitcoin meanwhile changed hands around $115,000, a 0.4% decrease over the past day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.

In a Myriad market, more than 80% of respondents believe that Bitcoin will trade above $105,000 throughout September. BTC last dipped below that level in June, although it has been buffeted by macroeconomic uncertainties more recently.

(Disclosure: Myriad is a prediction market and engagement platform developed by Dastan, parent company of an editorially independent Decrypt.)

Last week, Strategy said on X that options were listed on the Nasdaq for its preferred shares. So far this year, the company has unveiled four distinct types. Some can be converted into common shares, while others require Strategy to make regular dividend payments.

The company has also modified its equity issuance policy recently. In August, the firm said it would only issue common shares when its stock traded at more than a 2.5x premium to its Bitcoin holdings. That guidance was modified again to allow Strategy to also issue shares under the framework “when otherwise deemed advantageous.”

Strategy's stock was valued at a 1.26x premium to its Bitcoin holdings on Monday compared to a 1.39x premium a month ago, according to Bitcoin Treasuries. And Strategy's stock hasn't traded at a 2.5x premium to its Bitcoin holdings since November.

Some analysts believe that Strategy's self-imposed restriction compressed that premium, but in a Monday note, Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at investment bank Standard Chartered pointed to another potential factor: copycats.

“We see market saturation as the main driver of recent [premium] compression,” he wrote, arguing that there are currently “too many imitators” in the Bitcoin treasury space.

A saturated market may not be all bad, Kendrick countered. If fledgling firms that own Bitcoin become distressed, he said consolidation is a “strong possibility,” with Strategy poised to be among the most active buyers.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor has announced the purchase of additional Bitcoin BTCUSD. The latest purchase, however, comes with a major twist. Still, it demonstrates the firm's confidence in the potential of the leading coin.

Strategy buys 525 Bitcoin

Saylor disclosed in an X post that Strategy has acquired 525 BTC, valued at approximately $60.2 million. Per the transaction details, the firm purchased the new BTC at about $114,562 per coin.

Accordingly, Strategy has achieved a BTC yield of 25.9% year-to-date (YTD). Saylor added that the firm now holds a total of 638,985 BTC on its balance sheet. These coins were acquired for approximately $47.23 billion at about $73,913 per BTC.

This recent BTC acquisition indicates that Strategy is still confident about the future price trajectory of the leading coin. However, the major twist is that the 525 BTC acquisition is relatively smaller than what Strategy is generally known for.

Michael Saylor not giving up on Bitcoin

This reduced BTC accumulation comes amid recent criticism of the firm. For instance, angel investor Jason Calacanis urged investors to stay as far away as possible from Strategy. 

Rather, Calacanis advised investors to simply invest directly in Bitcoin. He argued that Saylor's aggressive BTC accumulation is actually damaging for the Bitcoin brand. 

Strategy has acquired 525 BTC for ~$60.2 million at ~$114,562 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 25.9% YTD 2025. As of 9/14/2025, we hodl 638,985 $BTC acquired for ~$47.23 billion at ~$73,913 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRC $STRK $STRF $STRD https://t.co/DiMeJVmEVD

His comments come shortly after Strategy failed to make it on the flagship S&P 500 index, despite meeting various criteria. In just a few hours after the news, shares of Strategy (MSTR) plunged as low as 2%.

JPMorgan analysts even highlighted the non-inclusion on the S&P 500 as a major setback for the company. 

Despite these challenges, the recent BTC accumulation shows that Saylor is not giving up on Bitcoin. The BTC evangelist recently tweeted an image of the latest iPhone 17 Pro in the color orange, traditionally associated by Bitcoiners with BTC.

Ethereum's total stablecoin supply has climbed to a record $166 billion, underscoring growing confidence in the network's role as a core DeFi infrastructure.

The Block's data dashboard shows that the total stablecoin supply on Ethereum reached $166 billion as of Saturday, up from $149.5 billion a month earlier. USDT remains the dominant stablecoin with $87.8 billion in supply on Ethereum, followed by USDC at $48 billion.



""Ethereum's stablecoin supply hitting an all-time high marks a defining moment, shifting from speculative asset to a backbone for dollarization within DeFi ecosystems,"" Vincent Liu, CIO of Kronos Research, told The Block. ""It also highlights that liquidity is now strong enough to absorb volatility and support the market during macro dips.""

Nick Ruck, director of LVRG Research, shared similar views, suggesting that Ethereum's record stablecoin supply ""signifies a massive increase in institutional liquidity and deepening trust in its infrastructure as the foundational layer for DeFi."" 

""Primarily driven by USDC and USDT expansion, the growth indicates accelerating institutional adoption that may lead to an increase in DeFi activity and potential ETH price appreciation to meet ecosystem demand,"" Ruck added.

Meanwhile, USDT's market cap climbed above $170 billion over the weekend, currently standing at $170.3 billion as of 2:30 a.m. ET Monday, according to CoinGecko data.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin miner BitMine Immersion has over $10.7 billion mostly in Ethereum on its balance sheet, the company announced on Monday. 

The Nasdaq-listed firm, which trades as BMNR, said that it currently held 2,151,676 ETH, worth $9.7 billion and 192 Bitcoin worth nearly $22 million at today's prices. It added that it also had unencumbered cash of $569 million, a $214 million stake in crypto treasury Eightco, and ""other crypto holdings.""

""As we mentioned in our August Chairman's message, the convergence of both Wall Street moving onto the blockchain and AI/ agentic-AI creating a token economy is creating a supercycle for Ethereum,"" Fundstrat Global Advisors Managing Partner Tom Lee said in a statement. 

The Peter Thiel-backed company is the biggest corporate holder of ETH, the second largest cryptocurrency by market value.  

 

In May, BitMine pivoted to raising money to buy ETH. Lee, the brains behind BitMine's ETH stacking strategy, has long been bullish on BTC but has said that Ethereum could be the ""next Bitcoin"" thanks to institutional interest in the coin. In his statement, he reiterated the company's aim to acquire 5% of the total Ethereum supply. 

""We continue to believe Ethereum is one of the biggest macro trades over the next 10-15 years,"" Lee said. ""Wall Street and AI moving onto the blockchain should lead to a greater transformation of today's financial system. And the majority of this is taking place on Ethereum.""

Consumers more widely are also upbeat about Ethereum. In a Myriad market, nearly 70% of the participants believe that ETH is more likely to reach $5,000 than sink to $3,500. Ethereum was currently trading a little above $4,520, down 1.6% over the past 24 hours, although it is up 78% over the past three months, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.

(Disclosure: Myriad is a prediction market and engagement platform developed by Dastan, parent company of an editorially independent Decrypt.)

Ethereum treasuries like BitMine are following a model pioneered by Strategy—formerly MicroStrategy—which shifted from software development to buying Bitcoin in 2020. Strategy now holds 638,985 BTC worth over $73 billion. 

Other Nasdaq-listed companies have followed suit—albeit mostly smaller, lesser-known entities—by buying not only Bitcoin and Ethereum but also altcoins like Solana, XRP, and Toncoin. These companies have achieved at least short-term stock price gains, sometimes with massive spikes.

BitMine's stock has rallied over 1,133 % since the end of June. It was recently trading at nearly $53 per share, up by nearly 5% on Monday. It touched a high of $135 in July.

Tom Lee-chaired Ethereum treasury company BitMine Immersion reported its crypto and cash holdings had reached $10.8 billion on Monday.

BitMine appears to have bought approximately 82,233 ETH ($370 million) since its last update on Sept. 8, broadly mirroring its reported acquisitions from onchain analysts last week. The company now holds 2,151,676 ETH, worth around $9.75 billion, alongside 192 BTC ($22.1 million), a $214 million stake in WLD treasury firm Eightco, and $569 million in unencumbered cash.

BitMine is currently the largest Ethereum treasury holder, followed by Joe Lubin's SharpLink and The Ether Machine, with approximately 837,230 ETH and 495,360 ETH, respectively, according to SER data. BitMine is also the second-largest public crypto treasury company overall, behind Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy, which holds bitcoin in the amount of 638,985 BTC ($73.5 billion).

Supported by institutional investors including Ark Invest's Cathie Wood, Founders Fund, Bill Miller III, Pantera, Kraken, DCG, and Galaxy Digital, BitMine targets acquiring 5% of the circulating ETH supply, currently equivalent to around 6.04 million ETH.



""BitMine has nearly $11 billion in total crypto holdings, surpassing the 2 million ETH milestone,"" Tom Lee said in a statement. ""As we mentioned in our August Chairman's message, the convergence of both Wall Street moving onto the blockchain and AI/ agentic-AI creating a token economy is creating a supercycle for Ethereum. And the power law benefits large holders of ETH; hence, we pursue the 'alchemy of 5%' of ETH.""

""We continue to believe Ethereum is one of the biggest macro trades over the next 10-15 years,"" Lee added. ""Wall Street and AI moving onto the blockchain should lead to a greater transformation of today's financial system. And the majority of this is taking place on Ethereum.""

BitMine (BMNR) is currently the 28th most traded stock in the U.S., trading $2 billion per day on a five-day average, the firm said. BMNR closed up 15.3% on Friday at $55.09, according to The Block's BitMine price page. It is down 1.8% in pre-market trading on Monday, per TradingView, having gained 572% year-to-date.

If you thought the cryptocurrency saga couldn't take more twists, think again. Amid a climate rife with volatility, Bitcoin's price stubbornly holds steady above a staggering $116,000. Meanwhile, Dogecoin finds itself in a tailspin, dropping alongside a legion of other altcoins struggling to find traction. With Bitcoin's trading volume eclipsing $32 billion, its dominance in the crypto arena remains unchallenged. Yet, the sharp contrast between Bitcoin's buoyancy and the fate of its lesser counterparts paints a vivid picture of a market grappling with its own identity.

With a formidable market capitalization surpassing $2.3 trillion, Bitcoin proves to be an unyielding titan, experiencing a slight uptick of 0.5% within the past day. This unwavering performance doesn't just attract retail investors; it piques institutional curiosity as well. The narrative surrounding Bitcoin hinges on its potential for long-term gains, and amid a sea of uncertainties, it is embraced as a beacon of stability. Those poised to invest can't help but be drawn to its promise of stability and growth, as it continues to dictate the rhythm of the crypto market.

Conversely, Dogecoin faces a stark reality check, plummeting 3.8% to a trading price of $0.2784. This decline serves as a sobering reminder of the whimsical nature of meme-based cryptocurrencies — assets that dance to the tune of social whims and speculative booms. While Bitcoin showcases resilience, Dogecoin's trials illuminate the inherent risks of riding the speculative waves of hype. Its current predicament compels potential investors to tread cautiously as the digital currency landscape evolves, raising pertinent questions about sustainability.

Ethereum, a stalwart in its own right, is not exempt from the waves crashing through the market. With a slip of 0.5%, hovering around $4,653.66, Ethereum finds itself scrutinized by competitors like Solana and XRP. Yet, beneath this surface-level decline lies a robust technical framework and ceaseless innovations that could spark a resurgence. As demand for decentralized applications swells, Ethereum's ability to capitalize on this trend may very well dictate its near-term trajectory, making it a focal point for market analysts and investors alike.

Surprisingly, the altcoin realm continues to reveal diamonds in the rough. Some smaller tokens manage to defy the downturn narrative, with OpenxAI soaring by an astonishing 97.9% and Nosana jumping an incredible 84.7% in daily activity. These impressive figures hint at a shifting focus among investors eager to explore niche projects that promise to thrive even in the stormiest of market conditions. This trend signifies a budding willingness to diversify portfolios, veering away from a landscape predominantly occupied by the larger cryptocurrencies.

The ongoing volatility within the crypto scene reinforces the contrasting narratives unfolding across different sectors. While Bitcoin's trading volume reassures investors of its health, the shrinkage of altcoin market capitalizations worries those with a keen eye for opportunities. Take Solana: despite a modest 1.9% decline, its trading volumes remain robust, projecting strength to DeFi enthusiasts hunting for reliable alternatives. This juxtaposition of stability and turbulence lays the groundwork for strategic investment considerations.

The unfolding drama among Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and the altcoin brigade paints a complex tableau in the cryptocurrency universe. While Bitcoin retains its steadfast positioning, the challenges confronting Dogecoin serve as a cautionary narrative for the speculative mindset. Nevertheless, the emergence of robust gains among smaller cryptocurrencies signifies a potentially transformative shift in investment strategies.

As we navigate this wild landscape, both investors and Web3 startups must remain astutely aware, maintaining a delicate balance between risk and opportunity. In this rapidly shifting terrain, those who embrace agility and insight may discover fruitful pathways, defying the odds even amid the tempestuous ebb and flow of the market.

American Express has introduced Ethereum-based ‘travel stamps' to create a commemorative record of travel experiences, as part of the firm's revamped travel app.

The travel experience tokens, which are technically NFTs (ERC 721 tokens), are minted and stored on Coinbase's Base network, said Colin Marlowe , VP, Emerging Partnerships at Amex Digital Labs.

The travel stamps, which can be collected anytime a traveler uses their card, are not tradable NTF tokens, Marlowe explained, and neither do they function like blockchain-based loyalty points – at least for the time being.

“It's a valueless ERC-721, so technically an NFT, but we just didn't brand it as such. We wanted to speak to it in a way that was natural for the travel experience itself, and so we talk about these things as stamps, and they're represented as tokens,” Marlowe said in an interview.

“As an identifier and representation of history the stamps could create interesting partnership angles over time. We weren't trying to sell these or sort of generate any like short term revenue. The angle is to make a travel experience with Amex feel really rich, really different, and kind of set it apart,” he said.

Fireblocks is also involved, supporting Amex as its Wallet-as-a-Service provider for the passport product, a Fireblocks representative said. 

The Amex travel app also includes a range of tools for travels and Centurion Lounge upgrades, the company said.

Nature's Miracle Holding Inc. (OTCQB: NMHI) is expanding into digital carbon markets with a planned acquisition of a $20 million carbon credit portfolio, aiming to tokenize the assets using blockchain technology.

The agriculture and cleantech firm, headquartered in Ontario, California, has signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) to purchase the credits from Carbon Credit Capital Co., Ltd. (Carbon Credit Corporation), based in Taiwan.

Under the agreement, Nature's Miracle intends to issue common stock to complete the transaction, according to a company statement on Monday.

Final terms, including the number of shares, will be outlined in a definitive purchase agreement expected within 30 days.

The portfolio comprises credits representing roughly one million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) reductions, primarily generated through hydroelectric and methane projects in Asia and South America.

These credits are verified under the Verra's Verified Carbon Standard, the world's most widely adopted greenhouse gas crediting framework.

Nature's Miracle plans to integrate the acquired credits into tokenized assets using the XRP Ledger (XRPL), a decentralized and energy-efficient blockchain that has gained traction for its low carbon footprint.

The move would enable more transparent and accessible trading of environmental assets, the company said.

Tie “James” Li, Chairman and CEO of Nature's Miracle, expressed enthusiasm about the acquisition, noting that leveraging XRPL for tokenization could position the company as a pioneer in applying blockchain to real-world assets.

Carbon Credit Corporation's CEO Ting Chen Kao added that tokenization would “enhance the accessibility, liquidity and accountability of the carbon credit trading.”

Nature's Miracle has recently broadened its focus beyond agriculture tech into electric vehicles, bitcoin mining, and XRP-based financial products.

In March 2021, a piece of digital art created by Mike Winkelmann went on the auction block at Christie's. The composition, titled “Everydays: the First 5000 Days,” was a collage of 5,000 works of digital art that Winkelmann created daily since 2007. Winkelmann's quirky graphics had begun as a diversion; he'd given many of them away for nothing.

But when the gavel came down, “Everydays” sold for $69,346,250.

Unique as the work was, many questioned whether it was truly worth that astonishing amount. But one detail helps explain the sale price: Winkelmann's work was an NFT—the “it” thing to own in 2021.

American Express shares climbed 0.81% to $327.95 as the company unveiled Ethereum-based digital travel stamps through its revamped app.



American Express (AXP)

These commemorative stamps mark cardholder journeys and function as valueless ERC-721 tokens stored on Coinbase's Base network. The product signals Amex's commitment to fusing traditional travel experiences with modern digital identity tools.

American Express launched a new feature in its travel app that issues blockchain-based digital stamps to commemorate trips. Each stamp acts as an NFT-like marker, technically an ERC-721 token, created on the Base network developed by Coinbase. The tokens are minted whenever a user books travel with their Amex card.

The stamps hold no monetary value and cannot be traded or transferred on secondary markets. American Express opted not to brand them as NFTs to maintain simplicity and relevance within the travel experience. Instead, the tokens serve purely as digital mementos that showcase where users have traveled.

Fireblocks plays a key role by powering the digital wallet infrastructure behind the new product. The startup offers Wallet-as-a-Service capabilities that allow seamless NFT integration inside the app. Users can access, store, and view their stamps through this wallet without additional steps or blockchain know-how.

Ethereum slipped 2.24% in trading, showing a contrast with Amex's integration of its blockchain infrastructure for product innovation. While ETH remains a cornerstone for many decentralized applications, its price faced typical volatility unrelated to Amex's specific project. The choice of Base, an Ethereum Layer 2, suggests continued enterprise confidence in Ethereum's underlying tech.

The Base network offers scalability and low transaction fees, making it suitable for high-volume minting use cases like Amex's travel stamps. This approach allows American Express to avoid mainnet congestion while ensuring interoperability with the wider Ethereum ecosystem. As more companies explore such integrations, utility-driven NFT use cases could become more common.

Ethereum's long-term adoption outlook remains steady, although short-term price movements do not always reflect enterprise-level engagement. Projects like Amex's show that blockchain infrastructure continues to attract large firms for customer engagement tools. These developments often occur without impacting crypto market prices.

Coinbase shares rose 0.13% following news of Amex utilizing the company's Base network to support digital passport stamps. The collaboration highlights Coinbase's continued push into Web3 infrastructure by offering enterprise-grade solutions beyond traditional exchange services. It also positions Coinbase as a backend partner for major financial institutions.

Base provides a developer-friendly environment for Layer 2 blockchain applications, reducing costs and boosting performance. Coinbase built Base to onboard companies like American Express that aim to deliver Web3 features without decentralization hurdles. This partnership validates Base's capacity to handle real-world, large-scale deployments.

The partnership strengthens its reputation within the fintech and Web3 sectors. The ongoing enterprise adoption of Base could provide steady growth opportunities as Web2 and Web3 merge. The Amex integration could serve as a template for future corporate collaborations on the Base platform.

A plant factory utilizing artificial light is an innovative agricultural model that enables efficient and sustainable crop production.

However, its application to a diverse range of crops remains limited. Edamame, a highly nutritious legume, has gained global popularity, yet its long-term storage is challenging due to quality deterioration, restricting its market distribution to seasonal availability. In this study, researchers successfully cultivated edamame using three hydroponic systems—nutrient film technique (NFT), rockwool, and aeroponics (mist culture)—within an LED plant factory. Among these, NFT demonstrated the highest fresh seed yield, which was comparable to or exceeded that of conventional field cultivation. The high yield was attributed to enhanced pod formation and biomass production under controlled conditions. Furthermore, although free amino acid content was lower in NFT cultivation, NFT-grown edamame exhibited significantly higher total sugar and isoflavone contents than field-grown counterparts, suggesting superior sensory quality and nutritional benefits.

These results indicate that NFT hydroponics is a promising method for stable, high-yield edamame production with enhanced nutritional properties. This study provides a foundation for expanding edamame cultivation in controlled environments, contributing to year-round supply and its potential application in urban and space agriculture.

         September 15, 2025
      

Teenagers are now responsible for a surge in cyber incidents across schools in the United Kingdom, according to a report from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).

ICO says students are behind more than half of all insider-led school data breaches that took place between 2022 and 2024. The good news is that it's mostly just about curiosity, dares, and rivalries more than anything else.



ICO took a closer look at 215 school data breach reports and discovered that students caused 57% of the incidents. In a third of the cases, children simply guessed weak passwords or used login credentials that other people wrote down. In fact, students accounted for 97% of breaches that involved stolen login credentials.

“Children are hacking into their schools' computer systems – and it may set them up for a life of cyber crime,” the ICO has stated in a press release.

On the other hand, about 5% of the attackers relied on advanced tools and methods to crack passwords or bypass security.



Students openly admit that they hack for dares, notoriety, financial gain, revenge, or rivalry.

“What starts out as a dare, a challenge, a bit of fun in a school setting can ultimately lead to children taking part in damaging attacks on organisations or critical infrastructure,” said Heather Toomey, Principal Cyber Specialist at the ICO.



The ICO detailed a few examples:



The report also revealed that staff mistakes were responsible for many breaches.

ICO labeled these findings “worrying” and urged schools to act immediately. The regulator told schools to refresh GDPR training, tighten access controls, and report breaches quickly.

BitcoinFi is finally here as a highly anticipated Bitcoin layer 2 project raises a fresh $16M in an ongoing funding round – find out more.

Despite hosting the world's most valuable cryptocurrency, Bitcoin's (BTC) financial layer remains far behind the second-largest blockchain, Ethereum (ETH), which holds $64.6 billion in total value locked (TVL) compared to Bitcoin's $7.39Bn. The contrast underscores how much potential still lies dormant within BitcoinFi.

Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) is designed to close that gap as the fastest Bitcoin Layer-2 ever built. With Solana's (SOL) efficiency matched to Bitcoin's security, it sets the stage for programmability and scalable applications to thrive on Bitcoin finally.

The project has raised $16M in presale funding in just three months, placing it among the top token launches of 2025 and signaling strong investor conviction in its potential. 

For investors, the current presale round offers HYPER priced at $0.012925 per token for the next seven hours, after which the price increases as the presale advances to the next stage.

Enterprise data platform Maestro released its “State of BitcoinFi” report last month, which highlights critical stats on the rise of BitcoinFi – essentially DeFi built on Bitcoin.

The report shows that staking has reached $7.39 billion in TVL. While significant, that figure still trails Ethereum's scale massively and is only about half Solana's $14.37Bn.

Stablecoins are also gaining ground in the Bitcoin ecosystem, with $860 million now locked. Growth is led by Avalon's USDa, a CDP-based stablecoin that allows users to lock BTC as collateral to mint USDa, and Hermetica's synthetic dollar, which is backed by Bitcoin reserves and hedging strategies.

Another key insight is the rise of programmability, with $5.52 billion—around 52,000 BTC—now sitting in environments where it can be used in DeFi, lending, stablecoin issuance, token creation, and other smart contract applications. 

Stacks more than doubled its TVL in Q2 2025, adding roughly 2,000 BTC, while sidechains hold the most BTC. At the same time, rollups and execution layers such as zk-rollups and SVM-based architectures are emerging and diversifying the landscape.

That figure underscores the institutional and developer push to make Bitcoin more than a static reserve asset. 

However, demand doesn't come only from the institutional side. On the cultural front, the rise of BRC-20 tokens has proven that retail users are equally eager to experiment with Bitcoin programmability – even if through less efficient means.



Source: https://www.gomaestro.org/reports/bitcoinfi-2025.html

If anything has proven that users want more from Bitcoin, it's the rise of BRC-20 tokens. 

Launched as a simple inscription standard on top of Ordinals, BRC-20 was never meant to be a full financial layer. Yet it exploded in popularity, with daily volumes reaching as high as $128 million, according to the Maestro report, and meme tokens like ORDI and SATS fueling an entirely new market segment.



https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/brc-20#key-stats

The problem is that BRC-20 is more of a workaround than an innovation. Balances rely on off-chain indexers instead of native validation, making ownership ambiguous. 

Every transfer bloats Bitcoin's base chain, driving up fees and sparking controversy. And without smart contracts, the tokens themselves remain limited to speculation rather than powering lending, stablecoins, or complex applications.

This is where the opportunity for the next wave of BitcoinFi projects becomes clear. BRC-20 shows undeniable demand for tokens and programmability on Bitcoin, but it also exposes the limitations of building without a scalable foundation.

Bitcoin Hyper is built to provide that foundation. As the fastest Bitcoin Layer-2 ever developed, it combines Solana-grade performance with Bitcoin's security, enabling smart contracts, DeFi, and token ecosystems to operate at scale finally. 



Bitcoin Hyper is being built around a canonical bridge that allows BTC to flow directly into its Layer-2 environment. Once bridged, that BTC gains full programmability. The model is somewhat similar to how users mint USDa on Avalon by locking Bitcoin as collateral, but in this case the wrapped asset is far more versatile.

This design establishes a foundation that past projects couldn't achieve. The canonical bridge is secured by zero-knowledge proofs that anchor transactions back to Bitcoin's base layer, while scalability comes from the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). 

With tools like Anchor, developers have access to a Rust-based environment, making it far easier to build safe, high-performance applications. Users benefit from parallelized execution, low fees, and confirmation speeds measured in sub-seconds, all while knowing their assets remain protected by Bitcoin's settlement guarantees.

Crucially, Bitcoin Hyper has been transparent about its progress. The team has published regular updates on X, including its ongoing research into the execution layer. 

Instead of defaulting to the Ethereum Virtual Machine and its serial constraints, Hyper's work with SVM shows how parallel transaction processing can map onto Bitcoin settlement without breaking trust. This commitment to open development stands in sharp contrast to projects like Fractal Bitcoin and SatoshiVM, which promised innovation but never built secure, sustainable infrastructure.

$HYPER Update

Hyper runs on Solana VM, mapping its parallel model to Bitcoin settlement—delivering faster dApps, validated flows, and stronger performance than EVM, with Solana's runtime + Bitcoin's security.

The outcome is an execution environment where modern, parallelized applications can thrive – with Bitcoin as the final settlement layer. That combination of speed, security, and developer readiness is what makes Bitcoin Hyper the most credible foundation for BitcoinFi's next stage of growth.

The native token HYPER powers the entire Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem. It serves as the gas token for transactions on the network, the staking asset that secures the chain, and the governance token that allows holders to guide its evolution. 

Many market observers, including top crypto education site 99Bitcoins, see it as a 100x token because every application built on the Bitcoin Hyper Layer-2 runs on HYPER.

The UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), students were responsible for most of the data breaches suffered by the schools in the country.

The U.K.'s independent regulator for data protection and information rights also reported that nearly one-third of insider attacks came from students guessing weak passwords or spotting them written on scraps of paper.

“Children are hacking into their schools' computer systems – and it may set them up for a life of cyber crime. That's the warning from us, as we have spotted a worrying pattern behind the culprits responsible for personal data breach reports from schools.” reads the alert issued by UK ICO.

Between January 2022 and August 2024, ICO researchers reviewed 215 insider data breach reports from the education sector and found students were responsible for most of the incidents. They caused 57% of all cases and 97% of breaches tied to stolen login details. The NCA warns that one in five children aged 10 to 16 admit to illegal online activity, with referrals starting as young as seven. Many teen hackers are English-speaking males, but girls also take part, with about 5% of 14-year-olds admitting to hacking. Kids hack for many reasons—dares, revenge, rivalries, status, or money—showing how curiosity often crosses into cybercrime.

“Whilst education settings are experiencing large numbers of cyber attacks, there is still growing evidence that ‘insider threat' is poorly understood, largely unremedied and can lead to future risk of harm and criminality.” said Heather Toomey, Principal Cyber Specialist.  

“What starts out as a dare, a challenge, a bit of fun in a school setting can ultimately lead to children taking part in damaging attacks on organisations or critical infrastructure.” 

“It's important that we understand the next generation's interests and motivations in the online world to ensure children remain on the right side of the law and progress into rewarding careers in a sector in constant need of specialists.” Toomey added.

An analysis of 215 insider breaches in schools shows clear patterns. Poor data protection drives 23% of incidents, with staff misusing data, leaving devices unattended, or letting students use them. The experts also reported that staff sending data to personal devices causes 20% of the incidents, while 17% stem from misconfigured systems like SharePoint. Only 5% of the incidents involved insiders using advanced methods to bypass security. These findings highlight how weak practices and human error fuel most school cyber incidents, while a minority show deliberate, skilled attempts to break defenses.

In one case reported by ICO, three year 11 students broke into their school's system holding data on 1,400 classmates. Curious about IT and cyber security, they tested their skills with password-cracking tools from the web. Two even admitted being part of an online hacking forum.

The NCA urges parents to talk with children about online behavior, warning that small “pranks” can become cybercrimes with serious consequences. Examples include logging into a friend's account without permission, misusing saved credit cards, or hacking into devices. The NCA's Cyber Choices program offers resources to guide kids in using their tech skills positively and to help families understand the risks of cybercrime.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","Bank of England stablecoin limits slammed by UK crypto groups: Report","https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-crypto-groups-oppose-bank-of-england-stablecoin-cap","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 10:42:41 GMT","

 UK crypto and payments groups urged the Bank of England to drop plans to cap individual stablecoin holdings, claiming the move would be costly and hard to enforce. 

United Kingdom-based cryptocurrency industry advocacy groups called on the Bank of England not to proceed with plans to limit individual stablecoin holdings.

In a November 2023 discussion paper, the bank floated setting individual caps on digital pounds between 10,000 British pounds ($13,558) and 20,000 pounds and asked for feedback on a possible lower limit of 5,000 pounds.

According to a Monday Financial Times report, industry groups criticized the plan, saying it would be difficult and expensive to implement and could leave the UK lagging behind other jurisdictions.

Tom Duff Gordon, vice-president of international policy at Coinbase, reportedly said that the limits would be bad for UK savers and the pound itself. “No other major jurisdiction has deemed it necessary to impose caps,” he said.

Simon Jennings, executive director of the UK Cryptoasset Business Council (UKCBC), told the FT that “limits simply don't work in practice.”

He added that “issuers don't have sight of who holds their tokens at any given time, so enforcing caps would require a costly, complex new system.” 

Last week, Jennings told Cointelegraph that UKCBC would like to “establish a transatlantic corridor for payments in stablecoins” between the UK and the United States. The Bank of England's plan would limit the effectiveness of such a system.

UK regulators fear that stablecoins could destabilize the traditional financial ecosystem. In early April, the UK Financial Policy Committee recognized that stablecoins and crypto markets have expanded significantly in the past year, drawing heightened regulatory attention.

The committee noted at the time that “even with appropriate regulation, greater use of stablecoins denominated in foreign currencies could make some economies vulnerable to currency substitution.” Similar concerns were raised in other countries as well.

Earlier this month, Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), called for policymakers to address gaps in stablecoin regulation. Among other remarks, she sounded the alarm that US stablecoin policies “could potentially result not just in further losses of fees and data, but also in euro deposits being moved to the United States and in a further strengthening of the role of the dollar in cross-border payments.”

Banks also fear that they may not be able to compete with the convenience of stablecoins if they are allowed to pay yields to their holders. Citi's Future of Finance head Ronit Ghose warned in late August that paying interest on stablecoin deposits could spark a wave of bank outflows similar to the money market fund boom of the 1980s.

Some in the crypto industry suggested that banks should step up their game to compete. “If local banks are worried about competition from stablecoins, they should pay more interest on deposits,” Bitwise's investment chief, Matt Hougan, recently said.

George Osborne, the former UK chancellor turned crypto lobbyist, recently said that the UK is falling behind in the digital asset market, particularly in the area of stablecoins.

Donald Trump has made billions from the Nasdaq debut of crypto startup World Liberty Financial. With his sons in charge and favorable policies in play, critics see a troubling mix of presidential power and personal gain.

US President Donald Trump and his family are pocketing billions from cryptocurrency ventures since his return to the White House, capitalizing on a loosely regulated market he has actively shaped.

From meme coins to stablecoins, digital currencies designed to stay at a fixed value, the financial windfall is estimated at over $5 billion (€4.25 billion) on paper, sparking accusations of unprecedented profiteering by a sitting president.

Two companies drive the Trump family's crypto profits: World Liberty Financial (WLF), a decentralized finance platform that lets users with $WLFI tokens help shape the platform's lending rules, and American Bitcoin Corp. (ABTC), a Nasdaq-listed bitcoin mining company.

WLF has earned millions from $WLFI token sales tied to Trump's name, while ABTC, backed by his sons, holds significant bitcoin assets and saw its stock jump 110% on its debut, before settling 16.5% higher than the opening price of $6.90.

Reuters news agency reported that a Trump business entity owns 60% of WLF and is entitled to 75% of revenue from coin sales.

Critics believe the Republican president's dual role as crypto beneficiary and policymaker undermines public trust and blurs the line between governance and self-enrichment.

Ross Delston, an independent American attorney and expert witness, thinks the crypto ventures could offer unscrupulous actors the chance to buy influence with Trump just by investing in his digital coins.

""This is a new avenue to allow the President to get money from anyone, including foreign individuals and states that would be prohibited by US [election] campaign laws, or someone convicted of a crime or under investigation,"" Delston told DW. 

Although Trump and his sons are barred from selling their own tokens in WLF for now, they are almost certain to profit big in the medium term. The White House insists, however, that there are no conflicts of interest.

Trump's favorable policies toward crypto after his return to office have come as a surprise to some after he called digital currencies like bitcoin a ""scam"" and a threat to the dollar during his first term. Now he wants to make the United States the crypto capital of the world.

Before returning to the White House, Trump nominated longtime crypto advocate Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US financial markets regulator. He was confirmed in the position in April.

One of Trump's first Executive Orders, signed in January, banned any US agency from creating or promoting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), a government-issued crypto version of the dollar.

In March, he established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, funded by cryptocurrencies seized by US authorities, and a Digital Asset Stockpile of other currencies. These assets are now treated as national reserves.

This summer, Trump signed the Genius Act, the first federal framework for stablecoins.

The embrace of crypto has extended beyond policy into high-profile social events, most notably the White House-hosted dinners for digital asset moguls. These gatherings, often featuring lavish menus and exclusive access to the president, have drawn scrutiny for blending political power with private financial interests.

One standout event was the May 2025 Crypto Kings dinner at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, where the top holders of Trump's meme coin, $TRUMP, were invited after collectively spending $148 million. 

The top 25 investors received private access to the president, while the four largest holders were gifted luxury Trump Tourbillon watches. Justin Sun, a China-born crypto billionaire and adviser to World Liberty Financial, was the top guest, spending $18.5 million.

Critics argue that such events serve less as forums for innovation and more as showcases for influence-peddling, where proximity to the presidency appears to be a perk of investment.

""This is maybe just one more step that this administration has taken of combining public office with private gain,"" Richard Briffault, a professor at Columbia Law School, told DW. ""This includes making regulatory decisions, but also using the prestige of the White House and the presidency to advance the Trump family's fortunes.""

US federal regulators have taken a markedly hands-off approach to crypto oversight, largely due to a sweeping executive order issued in January that dismantled many of the Biden-era guardrails and replaced them with a framework designed to promote innovation and accelerate adoption of cryptocurrencies.

Washington has removed some confusing rules about how crypto companies should report their finances, which made it hard for businesses to show crypto assets on their balance sheets or work with banks. By rolling them back, the administration is making it easier for crypto firms to operate and grow.

Before, the SEC was very strict, especially under its former leader, Gary Gensler. It launched many investigations and lawsuits against crypto firms. Those actions have mostly stopped under Trump 2.0.

While Biden's approach was more about caution and control, Trump's was described by one industry insider as ""crypto capitalism on steroids."" While the crypto sector is now booming, the latest US policies are raising serious questions about ethics, transparency, and long-term stability.

Concerns over political loyalty within federal agencies have also intensified, with critics pointing to a growing pattern of dismissals targeting career officials seen as out of sync with the Trump administration's agenda.

They include Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, CDC Director Susan Monarez, railroad regulator Robert Primus and, most notably, Erika McEntarfer, the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

""The administration has had no compunctions about firing people, including ordinary civil servants who are just doing their jobs, if they are politically out of step with the administration,"" said Briffault. ""There's no greater signal than the firing of the head of the Bureau of Labour Statistics. If they're willing to do that, they're willing to fire anybody.""

This climate of fear and retaliation has made regulators increasingly cautious about challenging Trump's crypto ventures, even when ethical concerns arise.

US lawmakers are now pushing Congress to bring back stronger oversight and tighten control over the latest crypto policies. They're calling for clearer rules on digital currencies, more transparency from companies like WLF, and limits on officials who hold crypto themselves. Critics warn the current setup benefits insiders and puts everyday users at risk.

""The most likely outcome is a huge increase in criminal prosecutions, regulatory enforcement actions, as well as economic dislocation following in the wake of this presidency,"" warned Delston.

Sentiment recovers in both Ethereum and Bitcoin, with US$3.3bn inflows

Digital asset investment products returned to inflows last week, totalling US$3.3bn, following weaker-than-expected US macroeconomic data. In addition, end-of-week price gains across digital assets pushed total assets under management (AuM) to US$239bn, the highest level since the early August all-time high of US$244bn.

Regionally, sentiment was broadly positive. The US led with US$3.2bn of inflows, while Germany recorded US$160m. Notably, Friday saw the second-largest daily inflows on record for Germany, although this was partly offset by US$92m of outflows from Switzerland.

Bitcoin experienced the strongest rebound in sentiment, attracting US$2.4bn in inflows, the largest weekly inflows since July, while short-bitcoin products recorded modest outflows, bringing their AuM down to just US$86m.

Ethereum, which had faced eight consecutive trading days of outflows, also saw a reversal in sentiment. It registered four straight days of inflows last week, totalling US$646m.

Solana marked its largest-ever single-day inflow on Friday at US$145m, contributing to a weekly total of US$198m.

Aave and Avalanche saw minor outflows of US$1.08m and US$0.66m respectively.

The America First Policy Institute is a think tank with enormous
influence on the Trump Administration. Members of the Institute
have joined the administration in senior positions. So, it was
fitting for Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Paul
Atkins, a Trump appointee, to launch ""Project Crypto"" in
a speech delivered to the Institute.1

He began with this: ""Today, I would like to discuss what
Commissioner Hester Peirce and I are calling 'Project
Crypto,' which will be the SEC's north star in aiding
President Trump in his historic efforts to make America the
'crypto capital of the world.'""2 Chairman
Atkins was speaking the day after the President's Working Group
(PWG) on Digital Assets released its 166-page report entitled
""Strengthening American Leadership In Digital Financial
Technology,""3 leaving no doubt about his alignment
with the digital asset policies of the president who appointed him.
The PWG report priorities for the SEC conform with the content of
Atkins's speech. Indeed, the PWG report was written in part by
staff borrowed from the SEC.

In his Project Crypto speech, Chairman Atkins laid out a series
of priorities for SEC staff, such as drafting ""clear and
simple rules of the road"" for different crypto activities,
including custody and trading, as well as allowing intermediaries
like exchanges to launch ""super-apps"" offering a broad
range of financial products and services. Chairman Atkins further
announced that he has directed SEC staff to develop a comprehensive
regulatory framework to bring cryptoasset distributions back
onshore in the United States, eliminating the need to rely on
offshore transaction structures and foundations. And he stressed
that market participants must have ""maximum choice"" in
how they custody and trade cryptoassets.

Chairman Atkins re-emphasized his view that most cryptoassets
are not securities. But even for cryptoassets that are securities,
he remarked, the rules need to be rewritten to facilitate offerings
rather than obstruct them — and the SEC staff has been
directed to make this happen. Offering an asset classified as a
security should not result in treatment akin to Hester Prynne, who
was forced to wear a ""scarlet letter,"" he remarked.

Chairman Atkins concluded his remarks with statements embracing
a complete change of course for this industry from the prior
administration:

As we advance these priorities, I look forward to working with
my counterparts across the Administration to make the United States
the crypto capital of the world. This represents more than a
regulatory shift — it is a generational opportunity.

And, we will ensure that the next chapter of financial
innovation is written right here in America.4

The Atkins SEC is famously open to new ideas. We have been
commenting directly to the SEC and its Crypto Task Force (chaired
by Commissioner Peirce) on the work of the Crypto Task Force and
will continue to do so as new rules are written and published for
public comment.

The emergence of peer-to-peer exchange platforms has had a transformative effect on the cryptocurrency market. Functioning outside the bounds of traditional finance, recommended crypto exchanges enable greater autonomy and introduce novel avenues for decentralized asset trading. These platforms are not only adapting to the rapidly changing nature of digital finance but are also actively shaping the trajectory of decentralised finance (DeFi). Let us explore a bit deeper how they operate and what sets them apart from their centralized counterparts.

Crypto exchanges that operate on a peer-to-peer basis are fundamentally different from conventional trading platforms. Rather than relying on intermediaries to process trades, users deal directly with one another, and the platform's role is limited to providing transaction tools such as escrow systems, while offering a secure environment for deal execution. This structure enhances user control over funds and supports a wide range of payment options tailored to local preferences.

The significance of recommended crypto exchanges in building a decentralized global financial system should not be underestimated. They extend cryptocurrency accessibility to underbanked regions, promote financial equality, and empower users worldwide.

Recommended crypto exchanges continue to redefine what is possible in the world of digital trading. By offering flexible, decentralized alternatives to traditional and commonly used financial systems, they empower thei customers and expand access to cryptocurrencies across global financial markets. With innovation at their core and a full commitment to decentralization, these platforms are setting the modern tone for the future of crypto trading and investment opportunieties in a digitally connected world.

Vitalik Buterin has advised against using AI to run cryptocurrencies after the newest upgrade to ChatGPT was used to disclose private information.

Vitalik Buterin, one of the co-founders of Ethereum, has warned against employing AI to run crypto projects because bad people could take advantage of the technology.

Buterin noted in a Saturday X post that “If you utilize an AI to assign cash for contributions, people WILL put a jailbreak + ‘gimme all the money' in as many places as they can.”

Buterin was reacting to a video from Eito Miyamura, who built the AI data platform EdisonWatch. The video revealed that a new feature added to OpenAI's ChatGPT on Wednesday may be used to expose private information.

A lot of people who use cryptocurrency have started using AI to make complicated trading bots and agents to handle their portfolios. This has led to the assumption that the technology may enable governance organizations run some or all of a crypto protocol.

Buterin's comments make people think about what could happen to Ethereum and other platforms that want to add AI. This advise points out weaknesses that these kinds of technology could show in treasury systems that are very decentralized. Even though Buterin's words didn't have an immediate effect on the market or financing, the advise tells the crypto community to be careful when it comes to AI governance. Even while treasury security vulnerabilities are still just ideas, they are nonetheless a big worry.

In the past, DAO governance manipulations set a precedent, however there are no records of AI-specific vulnerabilities. To avoid problems like these in the future, AI governance needs to be carefully watched. These kinds of observations about AI governance get people talking about how blockchain governance might work in the future. Possible governmental measures could change the course of crypto technology and treasury protections in decentralized ecosystems.","{'href': 'https://www.fxleaders.com', 'title': 'FXLeaders'}","cryptocurrency"

American Express has introduced Ethereum-based ‘travel stamps' to create a commemorative record of travel experiences, as part of the firm's revamped travel app.

The travel experience tokens, which are technically NFTs (ERC 721 tokens), are minted and stored on Coinbase's Base network, said Colin Marlowe , VP, Emerging Partnerships at Amex Digital Labs.

The travel stamps, which can be collected anytime a traveler uses their card, are not tradable NTF tokens, Marlowe explained, and neither do they function like blockchain-based loyalty points – at least for the time being.

“It's a valueless ERC-721, so technically an NFT, but we just didn't brand it as such. We wanted to speak to it in a way that was natural for the travel experience itself, and so we talk about these things as stamps, and they're represented as tokens,” Marlowe said in an interview.

“As an identifier and representation of history the stamps could create interesting partnership angles over time. We weren't trying to sell these or sort of generate any like short term revenue. The angle is to make a travel experience with Amex feel really rich, really different, and kind of set it apart,” he said.

Fireblocks is also involved, supporting Amex as its Wallet-as-a-Service provider for the passport product, a Fireblocks representative said. 

The Amex travel app also includes a range of tools for travels and Centurion Lounge upgrades, the company said.

Top meme tokens traded under pressure as a multimillion dollar hack of Shiba Inu's layer-2 network, Shibarium, dented investor confidence in joke cryptocurrencies.

On Sunday, Shibarium fell victim to a flash loan attack on its validator system, which drained about $2.4 million in ether (ETH) and SHIB. The CoinDesk Memecoin Index has dropped 6.6% in the past 24 hours. The broader market CoinDesk 20 Index  is down just 2.3%.

The attacker borrowed 4.6 million BONE, the governance token for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, often linked to the decentralized exchange (DEX) ShibaSwap, through a flash loan to gain control of the majority of validator keys. The keys act as gatekeepers of the network, confirming transactions and ensuring security.

With that control, the attacker was able to game the system into approving unauthorized transactions and walk away with a large amount of crypto assets from the bridge that connects Shibarium with the Ethereum blockchain. The process is akin to someone temporarily taking over a bank's security system to approve unauthorized withdrawals. A flash loan is a loan raised with no upfront collateral and returns the borrowed assets within the same blockchain transaction.

The Shiba inu team was able to prevent a bigger, more serious breach because the BONE tokens used to gain control  were reportedly tied to validator 1 and remained locked by the staking rules. 

Nevertheless, markets reacted negatively breach, which again underscores the perennial security issues with blockchain technology.

SHIB fell by the most in three weeks on Sunday (UTC), losing 4% $0.00001369, and has continued to weaken to trade recently at $0.00001359. The cryptocurrency experienced considerable volatility throughout the 23-hour trading window ended Sept. 15 at 02:00 UTC, with the aggregate range encompassing $0.000006191, a 4% oscillation from peak to trough.

The session commenced with pre-dawn fragility as SHIB retreated from $0.000014156 to establish a pivotal trough of $0.000013547 at 14:00 UTC. Volume of 1.064 trillion tokens surpassed the 24-hour mean, signaling robust distribution pressure and prospective capitulation, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model.

The BONE token, which initially doubled to over 36 cents, is now down over 2% on a 24-hour basis, trading at around 20 cents. 

According to the technical analysis model:

Meanwhile, SHIB's peer dogecoin DOGE$0.2646 fell 4% to 27.80 cents on Sunday and has since lost further 5% to 27.36 cents, according CoinDesk data.

A massive transfer of DOGE to a centralized exchange likely added to the bearish mood in the market. According to Whale Alert, crypto exchange OKX received 119,306,143 DOGE, worth over $34 million, from an unknown wallet. Such large transfers are typically associated with an intention to liquidate holdings.

Fears of a downside for bitcoin BTC$114,853.40 and ether (ETH) have eased substantially, according to the latest options market data. However, the pace of the next upward move in these cryptocurrencies will largely hinge on the magnitude of the anticipated Fed rate cut scheduled for Sept. 17.

BTC's seven-day call/put skew, which measures how implied volatility is distributed across calls versus puts expiring in a week, has recovered to nearly zero from the bearish 4% a week ago, according to data source Amberdata.

The 30- and 60-day option skews, though still slightly negative, have rebounded from last week's lows, signaling a notable easing of downside fears. Ether's options skew is exhibiting a similar pattern at the time of writing.

The skew shows the market's directional bias, or the extent to which traders are more concerned about prices rising or falling. A positive skew suggests a bias towards calls or bullish option plays, while a negative reading indicates relatively higher demand for put options or downside protection.

The reset in options comes as bitcoin and ether prices see a renewed upswing in the lead-up to Wednesday's Fed rate decision, where the central bank is widely expected to cut rates and lay the groundwork for additional easing over the coming months. BTC has gained over 4% to over $116,000 in seven days, with ether rising nearly 8% to $4,650, according to CoinDesk data.

What happens next largely depends on the size of the impending Fed rate cut. According to CME's Fed funds futures, traders have priced in over 90% probability that the central bank will cut rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 4%-4.25%. But there is also a slight possibility of a jumbo 50 bps move.

BTC could go berserk in case the Fed delivers the surprise 50 bps move.

""A surprise 50 bps rate cut would be a massive +gamma BUY signal for ETH, SOL and BTC,"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in an email. ""Gold will go absolutely nuts as well.""

Note that the Deribit-listed SOL options already exhibit a strong bullish sentiment, with calls trading at 4-5 volatility premium to puts. 

Magadini explained that if the decision comes in line with expectations for a 25 bps cut, then a continued calm ""grind higher"" for BTC looks likely. ETH, meanwhile, may take another week or so to retest all-time highs and convincingly trade above $5,000, he added.

The Ethereum Foundation (EF) is creating a dedicated artificial intelligence (AI) group to make Ethereum the settlement and coordination layer for what it calls the “machine economy,” according to research scientist Davide Crapis.

Crapis, who announced the initiative Monday on X, said the new dAI Team will pursue two priorities: enabling AI agents to pay and coordinate without intermediaries, and building a decentralized AI stack that avoids reliance on a small number of large companies. He said Ethereum's neutrality, verifiability and censorship resistance make it a natural base layer for intelligent systems.

The EF is a non-profit organization based in Zug, Switzerland, that funds and coordinates the development of the Ethereum blockchain. It does not control the network but plays a catalytic role by supporting researchers, developers and ecosystem projects. 

Its remit includes funding upgrades such as Ethereum 2.0, zero-knowledge proofs and layer-2 scaling, alongside community programs like the Ecosystem Support Program. The foundation also organizes events such as Devcon to foster collaboration and acts as a policy advocate for blockchain adoption.

In 2025, EF restructured to handle Ethereum's growth, emphasizing ecosystem acceleration, founder support and enterprise outreach. The new dAI Team represents a continuation of this shift toward specialized units addressing emerging technologies.

Crapis is a research scientist at the EF and will lead the new dAI Team. He said the group will connect its work with both the EF's protocol group and its ecosystem support arm. 

“Ethereum makes AI more trustworthy, and AI makes Ethereum more useful,” he wrote, adding that the team intends to fund public goods and projects at the intersection of AI and blockchains.

The group will build on recent work around ERC-8004, a proposed Ethereum standard that Crapis described as a way to prove who an AI agent is and whether it can be trusted. By offering identity and reputation systems for autonomous agents, the standard is intended to allow coordination without centralized gatekeepers.

Crapis said the team will support new standards and upgrades as they emerge, guided by Ethereum's values and the “d/acc” philosophy of decentralized acceleration. The goal, he explained, is to ensure AI development remains open and verifiable while giving humans greater agency over how intelligent systems interact with the economy.

For Ethereum, the move signals a growing ambition to anchor emerging technologies beyond finance. 

If AI agents begin transacting at scale, demand could grow for settlement rails, reputation systems and standards that run natively on Ethereum. For the AI community, the initiative offers an alternative to centralized platforms that currently dominate AI infrastructure.

“The more intelligent agents transact, the more they need a neutral base layer for value and reputation,” Crapis said. “Ethereum benefits by becoming that layer and AI benefits by escaping lock-in to a few centralized platforms.”

The team has begun hiring and publishing resources, according to Crapis. He said EF intends to work “with purpose and urgency” to connect AI developers with the Ethereum ecosystem and to accelerate research at the boundary of the two fields.

 The London Stock Exchange launched a Microsoft-powered blockchain platform for private funds, marking the first such initiative by a global exchange. 

Update Sept. 15, 7:58 am UTC: This article has been updated to include another section on LSEG and Microsoft's collaboration.

The London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) launched a blockchain-based infrastructure platform for private funds, making it the first major global stock exchange to use such a system.

The platform, called Digital Markets Infrastructure (DMI), supports the full lifecycle of digital assets, from issuance and tokenization to post-trade settlement. It was developed with Microsoft and runs on Microsoft Azure, the exchange said on Monday.

LSEG said the system was designed to provide interoperability between distributed ledger technology and traditional financial systems as part of its goal to become the first global exchange group to support clients across the “full funding continuum.”

Private funds are the first asset class to go live on the DMI, with plans for additional asset classes.

As part of the initial offering, private funds on the DMI will be discoverable by Workspace's users, enabling general partners to interact with professional investors on these platforms.

Capital management firm MembersCap and London-based Archax, a Financial Conduct Authority-regulated crypto exchange, were the first clients onboarded. MembersCap conducted the platform's debut transaction with Archax acting as a nominee for the Cardano Foundation.

Microsoft's collaboration with LSEG on the new blockchain-based platform is a “powerful example of the innovation driving our strategic partnership,” according to Bill Borden, corporate vice president of worldwide financial services at Microsoft.

Today's private market processes are ripe for innovation. LSEG aims to improve investor access to capital markets and enhance liquidity, according to Darko Hajdukovic, head of digital markets infrastructure at LSEG.

“We intend to do this by continually working with all stakeholders to enhance efficiencies and connectivity for both digitally-native and traditional assets,” Hajdukovic said, adding that there is significant “appetite for an end-to-end, interoperable, regulated financial markets DLT infrastructure.”

Ultimately, the platform aims to provide more investor access to private market investment opportunities that were previously difficult to discover and participate in.

Blockchain-based incentives from traditional finance giants may accelerate the convergence of traditional and decentralized finance (DeFi), which may come sooner than most expect, according to Nelli Zaltsman, head of blockchain payments innovation at JPMorgan's Kinexys.

“Our goal has always been to find the best way to work with the public blockchain, regulatory environment permitting,” said Zaltsman, speaking alongside Chainlink Labs co-founder Sergey Nazarov at the RWA Summit Cannes 2025.

In June, the banking giant piloted synchronized settlement technology with Chainlink, allowing JPMorgan's blockchain-based deposits to orchestrate transactions across different blockchains.

 Thailand froze three million bank accounts in an anti-scam crackdown, ensnaring users and prompting debate over whether Bitcoin offers a safer alternative. 

Innocent people and businesses have reportedly been caught in the crossfire as Thai banks froze millions of accounts suspected to be “mules” for scammers over the weekend. 

The nationwide crackdown began in August, and weekend reports suggest that banks have frozen three million accounts and imposed daily transfer limits on all bank customers in the Kingdom, according to reports.  

However, the Cyber Crime Investigation Bureau (CCIB) reported on Sunday that bank accounts of innocent online vendors and merchants are being frozen too after scammers adopted new methods to launder stolen money, according to the Bangkok Post. 

Meanwhile, the Bank of Thailand warned that more people could face freezes as authorities widen the dragnet and investigate mule accounts. 

“We urge the public not to panic. The suspension is only temporary and will be lifted once checks confirm no wrongdoing,” said Digital Economy and Society Ministry secretary Wisit Wisitsora-at on Monday, adding that commercial banks may suspend suspect funds for up to three days, while the police may extend the suspension to seven days.

Chinese-affiliated call centers, often based in neighbouring countries, have targeted Thailand this year with online scams, luring victims with social engineering attacks. 

Earlier this month, the Thai Police launched a full-time joint operation with Japan and India, as part of ongoing efforts to dismantle call center syndicates.

Expatriates residing in the country have taken to social media and online forums in droves to complain about being debanked or locked out of banking services in the country recently.

Several have seen their accounts at specific banks arbitrarily frozen or restricted for weeks with no explanation. Resident foreigners now have to register their biometrics at their local bank in person and follow strict Know Your Customer procedures to make larger transactions with the mobile apps. 

“Thank you, BoT, for the free Bitcoin marketing,” said crypto and technology investor Daniel Batten in response to the news. 

“This should be an international story. Thank god for Bitcoin,” said Jimmy Kostro from the Thailand Bitcoin Learning Center.

However, affected Thai residents could have trouble under the current laws. While Bitcoin and crypto trading remain popular in Thailand, the central bank has outlawed the use of digital currencies for payments.  

The limits of 50,000 baht ($1,570) were imposed in August by all banks nationwide in response to a wave of call center fraud with scammers using mule accounts to launder money. 

Some merchants have temporarily stopped accepting QR payments while account holders are reportedly withdrawing funds over fear of potential freezes.  

Amid growing public concern, the Thai central bank has held discussions with the CCIB on a workaround for the account freezing process and transfer limits for law-abiding account holders.

 A Bitcoin whale that swapped $4 billion in Bitcoin for Ether two weeks ago has started offloading more of the cryptocurrency. 

A long-term Bitcoin holder who sold $4 billion of his holdings for Ether last month has started selling again as Bitcoin crossed $116,000 for the first time in three weeks.

Two Bitcoin (BTC) wallets tied to an address that had held onto the cryptocurrency for over eight years deposited 1,176 BTC worth over $136 million into the trading platform Hyperliquid on Sunday and “started dumping,” according to Lookonchain on X.

Lookonchain said the wallet had taken a two-week break after it exchanged over $4 billion worth of Bitcoin in the second half of August, nearly 36,000 BTC for Ether (ETH).

Whale movements can hint at where “smart money” interest is shifting. Traders could see their sudden moves after years of inactivity as having a negative impact, as they could unload BTC on the open market and push down prices.

Lookonchain wrote to X on Sept. 1 that the Bitcoin whale it was tracking over the prior two weeks had sold 35,991 BTC, worth over $4 billion at the time, for Ether.

The ETH to BTC ratio has remained relatively flat since, but currently, the whale would lose nearly 460 BTC, worth about $53 million, if they were to swap their ETH holdings back to BTC.

The ETH to BTC ratio has been below 0.05 since July last year and hit its all-time peak in mid-2017 at 0.14. It's currently at 0.0401, gaining 6% over the past month.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin has seen resistance at $116,000, a price it reached on Friday for the first time since around three weeks ago on Aug. 23.

Bitcoin has traded flat over the past 24 hours at $115,500, hitting a top of $116,182 and a low of under $115,000, struggling to break well above $116,000.

It's down 7% from its peak high of over $124,000 on Aug. 14.

The latest Bitcoin whale sales seen by Lookonchain follow other high-value wallets that have sold in the past few weeks.

A wallet that held nearly 445 Bitcoin, which hadn't made a transaction in almost 13 years, made a transfer on Thursday, sending part of their stash to the crypto exchange Kraken.

Earlier in September, a wallet with nearly 480 Bitcoin also made transfers for the first time since 2012, seemingly only to move their funds to a new address.

 US President Donald Trump has appealed the district court's block on Fed Governor Lisa Cook's removal, but new evidence has emerged. 

United States President Donald Trump has filed an appeal in the case involving Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook ahead of a key interest rate decision by the central bank this week.

Lawyers representing the Department of Justice on behalf of the president have appealed against a preliminary injunction issued by the district court on Sept. 9, regarding Trump's decision to remove Cook from office. 

The administration argues that removal “for cause” is “a capacious standard that Congress has vested in the President's discretion” and is not subject to judicial review. 

“When a statute gives a power of removal ‘for cause,' without any specification of the causes, the removal decision is a matter of discretion and not reviewable,” it stated. 

President Trump attempted to remove Cook on Aug. 25 based on alleged “deceitful and potentially criminal conduct” concerning mortgage agreements, citing apparent misrepresentations in loan documents. Cook challenged this, arguing her firing exceeded presidential authority and violated her due process rights.

The case has led to a significant legal battle over presidential removal powers and renewed concerns over the Fed's independence, raising questions over the reliability of the US dollar. 

However, new evidence appears to have emerged that directly contradicts the Trump administration's mortgage fraud claims.

A May 2021 loan summary states that Cook's Atlanta property was used for a vacation home, supporting her position that she properly disclosed it as a second home, not her primary residence, according to an NBC report on Saturday.

The documents could mean that there may be no actual misrepresentation in her mortgage applications, weakening the government's arguments.

Trump's appeal comes a few days before a key Federal Reserve interest rate decision on Wednesday.

The Fed is expected to unanimously cut rates this week for the first time since December 2024. 

CME futures markets project a 96.4% probability of a 25 basis point cut to 4.0% to 4.25% on Wednesday, with a 3.6% chance of a larger 50 basis point cut. 

“Yes, you're going to get your rate cut out there in trading land,” RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas told Yahoo Finance, before adding that economic data doesn't suggest that there will be three cuts before the end of the year.

Freaky ‘Rubber Hand' Illusion Works on Octopuses, Too

Octopuses' response to a human illusion suggests a sense of body ownership

By Gennaro Tomma edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

An octopus awaits a species-specific version of the “rubber hand” experiment.

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

In the classic “rubber hand” illusion, illusion, a participant is tricked into experiencing a fake arm on the table in front of them as their own: their brain “feels” the tickle of a feather or other stimuli they see applied to the fake arm. (The real arm is behind a partition.) Until now, only some mammals, such as humans and mice, were known to be susceptible to this illusion. But a recent study in Current Biology shows that octopus brains can be tricked in the same way, adding another wrinkle to what we know about these creatures' inner lives.

First the scientists placed an octopus in a water tank where it could relax on a soft substrate similar to the seafloor. Then they inserted a partition that covered one of the octopus's arms and left a fake one visible instead. “It was important to make the rubber arm look like the octopus's real arm because in the human experiment, the illusion does not occur if the fake hand is shaped differently from the real human hand,” says study lead author Sumire Kawashima, a biologist at the University of the Ryukyus in Japan.

In the top video the octopus does not react to the fake arm being touched, and in the lower video it does.

Next the researchers simultaneously stroked the real and the fake arm with tweezers. After about eight seconds, they went on stimulating only the fake arm. All six octopuses that met the researchers' test conditions  reacted to the fake arm's stimulation with defensive responses such as escape maneuvers or body color changes. But when the experimenters tried different approaches such as stroking only the fake arm or stroking the arms asynchronously, the octopuses “were not surprised at all,” says study co-author Yuzuru Ikeda, also a biologist at University of the Ryukyus.

The findings suggest octopuses fall for the same illusion as humans—and thus may have a sense of body ownership like we do, the researchers say. But the octopuses' susceptibility to the illusion is an interesting result in itself because such perception has been thought of as one of humankind's “very advanced abilities,” Ikeda says.

“I hadn't seen anything like this before,” says Kristin Andrews, a philosopher at York University in Toronto, who studies animal minds. She says the study seems to offer evidence that octopuses are “self-conscious” or aware of their bodies, although “we can't assume that octopuses have the same intuitive belief in a separation between a core self and the body that humans seem to have. [They] might see the world in a very different way.”

Well... a small replica of the front of a warship. But it was still an example of master craftsmanship.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In what was one of the greatest decoration flexes in ancient Roman design, a wealthy resident of Iuvavum—now modern-day Salzburg, Austria—in the second or third century C.E. had a bronze replica of a Roman warship's prow in their urban villa's dining room. 

That three-pound gold-colored bronze piece was recently found during an excavation ahead of a development in Salzburg's Old Town. Buried in the collapsed layers of the villa, it's the largest bronze object found in the city in over 80 years.

“Since the mid-20th century, we had not recovered in the urban area of Salzburg-Iuvavum a bronze artifact of these dimensions and characteristics,” said Ulli Hampel, director of the Archaeology Collection at the Salzburg Museum, in a museum statement according to translated reports from local media. “Bronze objects of antiquity of this caliber are extremely rare, since the vast majority were melted down to reuse the valuable metal. This spectacular specimen survived because it was buried under the collapse of the villa's walls.”

The piece was found in a precarious position, broken in multiple locations under the rubble of a once-luxurious villa. It took the museum team over a year, not only to excavate all the pieces while operating under a microscope, using scalpels and an ultrasonic chisel, but then to recreate the form with the help of acrylic and preserve it with a protective layer of microcrystalline wax. 

The museum's archeological restoration workshop pieced the puzzle back together and discovered what exactly the bronze piece was. “In our work, I was able to take precise impressions of the individual parts and, from the plastic copies created from them, fabricate a reformulation and reconstruction of the spectacular object,” said Maximilian Bertet, archaeological restorer at the museum. “Thus, it became clear to me that it was not an oil lamp, but a decorative piece.” 

The experts believe the bronze offers a faithful representation, crafted to scale, of the prow of a Roman war galley, including the rostrum (ramming spur), an underwater weapon meant to surprise and sink enemy ships. The prow is ornamental with floral decorations and the museum team reported that the detailing is so precise that the railings of the ship are clear. 

The placement of this miniature replica of a naval warship in the dining room of a Roman villa was seen as a sign of high status, as well as sheer clever decorating. First-century author Titus Petronius described in Satyricon how the prow of a ship was recreated in bronze and served as doorposts of dining rooms in wealthy villas:

An iron spike was used to hold the prow in place, anchored into the hollow portion of the bronze with a complex casting that included a decorative disc fixed between the wall and the prow. 

“In the time of the Roman Republic, the rams of captured ships were displayed as trophies—as a sign of the power and triumph of the Roman Empire,” Bertet said. Hanging a rostrum on the wall was akin to a captured shield, or the head of a wild animal caught while hunting. It showed not only wealth, but allegiance to the Roman Empire and appreciation for the empire's naval superiority.

Originally meant as a decorative symbol to show off status, the bronze prow and rostrum will once again fulfill its original intention by highlighting an exhibit of the Salzburg branch of the new Iovavum Archaeological Museum in Salzburg when it opens in 2028.

Forget the badlands and deserts. Some of the world's most important fossil discoveries are hiding in New Jersey's suburbs.

When you think of prime locations for finding fossils of the ancient creatures that inhabited our planet thousands of years ago, notable places like Egypt and China may come to mind. But what about … New Jersey?

The Garden State probably isn't even the first U.S. state where you'd expect to discover fossils. But it's where the first nearly complete dinosaur skeleton was found in 1858, as well as where paleontologists discovered the first Tyrannosaur, the Dryptosaurus. And New Jersey also happens to be the home of a paleontological gold mine–a quarry pit tucked behind a shopping center with a Lowe's and Chick-fil-A in Mantua Township. 

Kenneth Lacovara, Ph.D., has spent years traveling the world to uncover prehistoric fossils, but it's the quarry near where he grew up in southern New Jersey that has yielded more than 100,000 fossils representing more than 100 species over the past 18 years. In March, the Edelman Fossil Park and Museum officially opened its doors to the public to explore the fossil quarry and learn more about the ancient creatures that once roamed the Earth.

Popular Mechanics spoke with Lacovara to learn more about why New Jersey provides such a rich look at our planet's past.

Your hunches about the future aren't just in your head.

For years, the strange phenomenon of precognition–an unwavering “gut feeling” that something will happen in the future–has puzzled scientists. The eerie concept may sound far-fetched, but many studies suggest there's statistical evidence to back up precognition's existence.

At the center of the research is a mid-1990s study by parapsychologist Dean Radin, Ph.D. that reshaped how we understand our ability to predict the future. 

Curious about your consciousness? Dive deeper into the science behind gut feelings and your mind's brilliant capabilities.

While working at the University of Nevada, Radin, who had studied precognition for years, hypothesized that if consciousness transcended time, reactions to a stimulus would occur before the stimulus actually appeared. So, he put that hypothesis to the test, using an EEG machine to record the brain activity of study participants.

Hooked up to the EEG, the subjects reacted to prompts and images, including positive photos (like a sunrise) and negative pictures (such as a car crash). The EEG measured the subject's brain activity during the short, five-second span between when they received the prompt and when they saw the image.

The results were astounding. When a subject predicted a positive image, they reacted very little, but they showed a spike in brain activity when they expected to see a negative image. Radin's findings were statistically significant, and since then, researchers have replicated his study successfully nearly three dozen times.

His work proved influential enough that the CIA declassified its pre-sentiment research in 1995, and statisticians confirmed the effect was statistically reliable.

Still, questions remain about the science behind precognition. Numbers prove it exists, but why? What causes those psychic gut feelings? Is time truly linear? While Radin's work provided a runway for substantiating precognition, the next step is finding evidence of its mechanism—and perhaps convincing others to let go of their fears of the unknown.

Still mind-boggled by the future-predicting capabilities of your consciousness? Dive deeper into the mysteries of gut feelings and foreseeing the future by reading Pop Mech's feature on the complexity of precognition.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Daily eye drops could make reading glasses obsolete","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250914205832.htm","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 05:31:57 GMT","

Everybody develops presbyopia as they age - a difficulty in focusing on near objects and text - and often have to resort to reading glasses. However, the solution might be as simple as using special eye drops two or three times a day.

A retrospective study of 766 patients presented on September 14 at the 43rd Congress of the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ESCRS) [1], found that the majority could read an extra two, three or more lines on the eye chart used for testing near visual acuity (the Jaeger chart) after using specially formulated eye drops. This improvement was sustained for up to two years.

Dr Giovanna Benozzi, director of the Center for Advanced Research for Presbyopia, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, said: ""We conducted this research due to the significant unmet medical need in presbyopia management. Current solutions such as reading glasses or surgical interventions have limitations, including inconvenience, social discomfort, and potential risks or complications. There is a group of presbyopia patients who have limited options besides spectacles, and who are not candidates for surgery; these are our primary focus of interest. We sought to provide robust clinical evidence supporting an innovative pharmacological solution to offer patients a non-invasive, convenient and effective alternative.""

The eye drops, developed by Dr Benozzi's father, the late Dr Jorge Benozzi of the same centre, contain a combination of two active agents: pilocarpine, a drug that constricts the pupils and contracts the ciliary muscle, which is a muscle controlling the eye's accommodation for seeing objects at varying distances, and diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces inflammation and the discomfort that pilocarpine often causes.

Patients administered the eye drops twice a day, usually on waking and again approximately six hours later, with an optional third dose if symptoms recurred or additional visual comfort was needed. The group of patients (373 women and 393 men, with an average age of 55) were divided into three groups to receive one of three eye drop formulations. Each formulation had a fixed dose of diclofenac but concentrations of pilocarpine were 1%, 2% and 3%.

The researchers assessed the improvement in how well patients could read the Jaeger chart without reading glasses (uncorrected near visual acuity) one hour after the first administration of the drops, and they followed up the patients for two years.

Dr Benozzi told the Congress: ""Our most significant result showed rapid and sustained improvements in near vision for all three concentrations. One hour after having the first drops, patients had an average improvement of 3.45 Jaeger lines. The treatment also improved focus at all distances.

""Impressively, 99% of 148 patients in the 1% pilocarpine group reached optimal near vision and were able to read two or more extra lines. Approximately 83% of all patients maintained good functional near vision at 12 months. Importantly, no significant adverse events like increased intraocular pressure or retinal detachment were observed.""

In the 2% group, 69% of 248 patients were able to read three or more extra lines on the Jaeger chart, and in the 3% group, 84% of 370 patients could read three or more extra lines.

The improvement in the patients' vision was sustained for up to two years, with a median duration of 434 days. Adverse side effects were mild, with the most common being temporary dim vision, which occurred in 32% of cases, irritation when the drops were instilled (3.7%) and headache (3.8%). No patients discontinued the treatment.

Common adverse side effects of pilocarpine can also include eye redness, watery eyes, blurred vision, dim or dark vision, sensitivity to light or problems changing focus between objects, seeing flashes of light or ""floaters"" in vision, and, in rare cases, detached retinas.

Dr Benozzi continued: ""Nearly all patients experienced positive improvements in near visual acuity, although the magnitude of the improvement depended on the status of their vision before treatment at baseline. Our study revealed that optimal pilocarpine concentrations could be individualized depending on the baseline severity of presbyopia as assessed by the initial Jaeger scores. Patients with less severe presbyopia responded best to 1% concentrations, while those with more advanced presbyopia required higher 2% or 3% concentrations to achieve significant visual improvement.""

She concluded: ""These results suggest this combination therapy offers a safe, effective, and well-tolerated alternative to traditional presbyopia management. It significantly reduces dependence on reading glasses, providing a convenient, non-invasive option for patients, although these eye drops may not eliminate the need for glasses in all individuals.

""Importantly, this treatment is not intended to replace surgical interventions, but rather to serve as a valuable solution for patients who need safe, effective, and personalised alternatives and seek freedom from the inconvenience of eyewear. Eye care professionals now have an evidence-based pharmacological option that expands the spectrum of presbyopia care beyond glasses and surgery.""

Besides the group of patients in this study, Dr Benozzi has other patients who have received the treatment for more than ten years. Dr Benozzi plans further research to measure improvements in patients' quality of life, and to explore the underlying physiological mechanisms of the eye drops.

Strengths of the study include the large number of patients included and the long follow-up time. It is the first systematic evaluation comparing three different pilocarpine concentrations in combination with diclofenac. A limitation is that it is a retrospective, single-centre study, which could limit the generalizability of the findings and introduce selection bias.

ESCRS President-Elect, Professor Burkhard Dick, chair of the ophthalmology department at the University Eye Hospital Bochum, Germany, was not involved in the research. He commented: ""While surgery for age-related near vision loss has advanced, some patients are not candidates. The single-centre retrospective study by Dr Benozzi suggests that eye drops containing pilocarpine and diclofenac may improve near vision for up to two years, but the limited design means the results may not apply to everyone. Long-term pilocarpine use can sometimes cause side effects such as reduced night vision, dimmer vision in low light, eye strain, irritation and, in rare cases, retinal detachment, while prolonged topical NSAID use may pose corneal risks. Broader, long-term, multi-centre studies are needed to confirm safety and effectiveness before this treatment can be widely recommended.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Being too thin can be deadlier than being overweight, Danish study reveals","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250914205759.htm","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 01:56:52 GMT","

It is possible to be ""fat but fit,"" new research being presented at the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in Vienna, Austria (September 15-19) suggests.

The study of tens of thousands of people in Denmark found that those with a BMI in the overweight category - and even some of those living with obesity - were no more likely to die during the five years of follow-up than those with a BMI of 22.5-<25.0 kg/m2, which is at the top end of the normal weight range.

Individuals with a BMI in the middle and lower parts of the normal weight range 18.5 to <22.5kg/m2, were also more likely to die. As were individuals with a BMI in the underweight range.

""Both underweight and obesity are major global health challenges,"" says Sigrid Bjerge Gribsholt, of the Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark, who led the research. ""Obesity may disrupt the body's metabolism, weaken the immune system and lead to diseases like type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and up to 15 different cancers, while underweight is tied to malnutrition, weakened immunity and nutrient deficiencies.

""There are conflicting findings about the BMI range linked to lowest mortality. It was once thought to be 20 to 25 but it may be shifting upward over time owing to medical advances and improvements in general health.""

To provide some clarity, Dr Gribsholt, Professor Jens Meldgaard Bruun, also of the Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, and colleagues used health data to examine the relationship between BMI and mortality in 85,761 individuals (81.4% female, median age at baseline 66.4 years).

BMI is a measure of weight to height and a score of 18.5 to <25 kg/m2 is generally considered to be of normal weight. A BMI of <18.5 kg/m2 is categorized as underweight, 25 to <30 kg/m2 is considered overweight and a BMI of 30 kg/m2 is described as obesity.

7,555 (8%) of the participants died during follow-up. The analysis found that individuals in the underweight category were almost three times more likely (2.73 times) to have died than individuals with a BMI towards the top of the healthy range (22.5 to <25.0 kg/m2, the reference population).

Similarly individuals with BMI of 40 kg/m2 and above (categorized as severe obesity) were more than twice as likely (2.1 times) to have died compared with the reference population.

However, higher mortality rates were also found for BMIs that are considered healthy.

Individuals with a BMI of 18.5 to <20.0 kg/m2, and so at the lower end of the healthy weight range, were twice as likely to have died as those in the reference population. Similarly, those with a 20.0 to <22.5 kg/m2, and so in the middle of the healthy weight range, were 27% more likely to have died than the reference population.

By contrast, individuals with a BMI in the overweight range (25 to <30 kg/m2) and those with a BMI at the lower part of the obese range (30.0 to <35.0 kg/m2) were no more likely to have died than the those in the reference population - a phenomenon sometimes referred to as being metabolically healthy or ""fat but fit.""

Those with a BMI of 35 to <40.0 kg/m2 did have an increased risk of death of 23%.

All of the results were adjusted for sex, comorbidity level and education level.

A similar pattern was obtained when the researchers looked at the relationship between BMI and obesity in participants of different ages, sexes and levels of education.

The researchers were surprised to find that BMI was not associated with a higher mortality up to a BMI of 35 kg/m2 and that even a BMI 35 to <40 kg/m2 was only associated with a slightly increased risk.

Dr Gribsholt says: ""One possible reason for the results is reverse causation: some people may lose weight because of an underlying illness. In those cases, it is the illness, not the low weight itself, that increases the risk of death, which can make it look like having a higher BMI is protective.

""Since our data came from people who were having scans for health reasons, we cannot completely rule this out.

""It is also possible that people with higher BMI who live longer - most of the people we studied were elderly - may have certain protective traits that influence the results.

""Still, in line with earlier research, we found that people who are in the underweight range face a much higher risk of death.""

Whatever the explanation, BMI isn't the only indicator that an individual is carrying unhealthy levels of fat, says Professor Bruun.

He explains: ""Other important factors include how the fat is distributed. Visceral fat - fat that is very metabolically active and stored deep within the abdomen, wrapped around the organs - secretes compounds that adversely affect metabolic health.

""As a result, an individual who has a BMI of 35 and is apple-shaped - the excess fat is around their abdomen - may have type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure, while another individual with the same BMI may free of these problems because the excess fat is on their hips, buttocks and thighs.

""It is clear that the treatment of obesity should be personalized to take into account factors such as fat distribution and the presence of conditions such as type 2 diabetes when setting a target weight.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Cannabis use may quadruple diabetes risk","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250914205803.htm","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 02:54:55 GMT","

Cannabis use is linked to an almost quadrupling in the risk of developing diabetes, according to an analysis of real-world data from over 4 million adults, being presented at this year's Annual Meeting of The European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in Vienna, Austria (September 15-19).

Cannabis use is increasing globally with an estimated 219 million users (4.3% of the global adult population) in 2021, but its long-term metabolic effects remain unknown. While some studies have suggested potential anti-inflammatory or weight management properties, others have raised concerns regarding glucose metabolism and insulin resistance, and the magnitude of the risk for developing diabetes hasn't been clear.

To strengthen the evidence base, Dr Ibrahim Kamel from the Boston Medical Center, Massachusetts, USA and colleagues analyzed electronic health records from 54 healthcare organizations (TriNetX Research Network, with centers from across USA and Europe) to identify 96,795 outpatients (aged between 18 and 50 years, 52.5% female) with cannabis-related diagnoses (ranging from occasional use to dependence, including cases of intoxication and withdrawal) between 2010 and 2018.

They were matched with 4,160,998 healthy individuals (with no record of substance use or major chronic conditions) based on age, sex, and underlying illnesses at the start of the study, and followed for 5 years.

After controlling HDL and LDL cholesterol, uncontrolled high blood pressure, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, cocaine use, alcohol use and several other lifestyle risk factors, the researchers found that new cases of diabetes were significantly higher in the cannabis group (1,937; 2.2%) compared to the healthy group (518; 0.6%), with statistical analysis showing cannabis users at nearly four times the risk of developing diabetes compared to non-users.

While the authors note that more research is needed to fully explain the association between cannabis and diabetes, it may come down to insulin resistance and unhealthy dietary behaviours. Nevertheless, the study's results have immediate implications for metabolic monitoring practices and public health messaging.

“As cannabis becomes more widely available and socially accepted, and legalized in various jurisdictions, it is essential to understand its potential health risks,” said lead author Dr Kamel. “These new sights from reliable real-world evidence highlight the importance of integrating diabetes risk awareness into substance use disorder treatment and counseling, as well as the need for healthcare professional to routinely talk to patients about cannabis use so that they can understand their overall diabetes risk and potential need for metabolic monitoring.”

The authors note that more research is needed on the long-term endocrine effects of cannabis use and whether diabetes risks are limited to inhaled products or other forms of cannabis such as edibles.

Despite the important findings, this is a retrospective study and cannot prove that cannabis use causes diabetes, and the authors cannot rule out the possibility that other unmeasured factors may have influenced the results despite efforts to reduce confounding bias via propensity score matching. This study has limitations due to lack of detailed cannabis consumption data and potential misclassification. The authors acknowledge inherent limitations of real-world data often result from inconsistent patient reporting in electronic medical records. They also note that there is a risk of bias because of imprecise measures of cannabis exposure and the reliance on participants to accurately report any cannabis use, even when they lived in places where the drug is illegal.

Against the backdrop of high market demand for effective anti-ageing cosmetics, a team of Chinese researchers assessed the clinical effectiveness of a 0.1 % pterostilbene-containing skincare emulsion against a control emulsion over 28 days with 31 participants.

The study employed a double-blind, split-face design, comparing the left and right sides of the face and using advanced instruments along with subject self-assessments. The set of instruments used, together with the findings, is reported in the team's published article in the Journal of Dermatologic Science and Cosmetic Technology.

""Our results indicated that the pterostilbene emulsion remarkably improved skin elasticity, firmness, and reduced wrinkles, such as forehead, undereye, and Crow's feet wrinkles, shares co-author Zhiyuan Chen, Founder of Guangzhou Luanying Cosmetics Co., Ltd. ""It also increased the thickness of the epidermis layer, enhanced collagen and elastic fibers, and minimized skin pores.""

Compared to the control emulsion, the pterostilbene emulsion brought about statistically significant improvements, and all subjects expressed higher satisfaction with the pterostilbene emulsion. These results collectively demonstrated the superior anti-aging efficacy of the pterostilbene emulsion through multiple mechanisms.

According to corresponding author Xueping Chen, the findings advance our understanding of pterostilbene's role in skincare by providing evidence of its potent anti-ageing effects and supporting its use as an active ingredient in cosmetics. ""It also offers a new perspective on natural compounds' applications in the skincare industry,"" says Chen. ""The significant improvements in various skin parameters and the subjects' positive feedback highlight the effectiveness of pterostilbene, which may change the way we approach anti-ageing skincare formulations.""

The authors propose a longer study period to fully understand the impact of pterostilbene.

A research team including faculty at Binghamton University, State University of New York have identified two previously unknown species of parasitic wasps living in the United States.A research team including facutly at Binghamton University, State University of New York have identified two previously unknown species of parasitic wasps living in the United States.

Oak gall wasps and their predators don't have the panache of butterflies, but they're attracting growing interest among both scientists and naturalists.

Only 1 to 8 millimeters long, these small insects create the tumor-like plant growths known as ""galls."" Small as a pinhead or large as an apple, galls can take striking shapes, with some resembling sea urchins or saucers, explained Binghamton University Associate Professor of Biological Sciences Kirsten Prior, who also co-leads Binghamton's Natural Global Environmental Change Center.

And if these wasps are a mascot for anything, it's biodiversity. North America has around 90 different species of oak trees, and around 800 species of oak gall wasps that live upon them. Parasitic wasps lay their eggs in the galls and go on to devour the entire oak gall wasp.

But how many species of parasitoid wasps are out there? That's a question that scientists -- both academic researchers traveling the globe and everyday citizens in their own backyard -- are working to answer.

A recent article in the Journal of Hymenoptera Research, ""Discovery of two Palearctic Bootanomyia Girault (Hymenoptera, Megastigmidae) parasitic wasp species introduced to North America,"" gives insight into a previously unknown level of species diversity. In addition to Prior, co-authors include current graduate student Kathy Fridrich and former graduate student Dylan G. Jones, as well as Guerin Brown, Corey Lewis, Christian Weinrich, MaKella Steffensen and Andrew Forbes of the University of Iowa, and Elijah Goodwin of the Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture in Tarrytown, N.Y.

This discovery is part of a larger research effort. In 2024, the National Science Foundation awarded a $305,209 grant to Binghamton University for research into the diversity of oak gall wasps and parasitoids throughout North America. The project is a collaboration between Prior, Forbes at the University of Iowa, Glen Hood at Wayne State University and Adam Kranz, one of the creators behind the website Gallformers.org, which helps people learn about and identify galls on North American plants.

The NSF grant investigates a core question: How do gall-forming insects escape diverse and evolving clades of parasitic wasps -- and how do parasites catch up? To answer that question, researchers are collecting oak gall wasps around North America and using genetic sequencing to determine which parasitic wasps emerge from the galls. Among them are Fridrich and fellow Binghamton graduate student Zachary Prete, who spent the summer on a gall- and parasitoid-collection trip from New York to Florida.

""We are interested in how oak gall characteristics act as defenses against parasites and affect the evolutionary trajectories of both oak gall wasps and the parasites they host. The scale of this study will make it the most extensive cophylogenetic study of its kind,"" Prior said. ""Only when we have a large, concerted effort to search for biodiversity can we uncover surprises -- like new or introduced species.""

Discovering unknown species

Over the past several years, researchers with Prior's lab traveled the West Coast from California to British Columbia, collecting approximately 25 oak gall wasp species and rearing tens of thousands of parasitic wasps, which were ultimately identified as more than 100 different species.

Some of the parasitoids, reared from oak gall wasp species from several locations, turned out to be the European species Bootanomyia dorsalis in the wasp family Megastigmidae. Researchers at the University of Iowa identified a similar wasp from collections they made in New York state.

""Finding this putative European species on the two coasts of North America inspired our group to confirm this parasitic species' identity and whether it was, in fact, an introduced parasite from Europe,"" Prior explained.

Parasitic wasps are small and challenging to identify based on features alone. Because of this, researchers use genetic tools to confirm a species' identity, sequencing ""the universal barcoding gene,"" Cytochrome Oxidase Subunit I (mtCOI), and comparing their results to reference libraries. What they discovered is that the European species B. dorsalis came in two separate varieties, or clades: the New York samples were related to species in Portugal, Iran and Italy, while the Pacific coast wasps were related to those from Spain, Hungary and Iran.

""The sequences from two clades were different enough from each other that they could be considered different species. This suggests that B. dorsalis was introduced at least twice, and that the New York and West Coast introductions were separate,"" Prior said.

And while they were found in at least four different oak gall wasp species from Oregon to British Columbia, all the West Coast B. dorsalis wasps were genetically identical, which means that their introduction was small and localized. The East Coast wasps had slightly more genetic diversity, which could indicate that there was less of a population bottleneck, or that the species was introduced more than once.

How did the European species get here? One possibility is that non-native oak species were intentionally introduced to North America. English oak, or Quercus robur, was widely planted for wood since the 17th century, and is found in British Columbia as well as several northeastern states and provinces. Turkey oak, Q. cerris, is an ornamental tree now found along the East Coast -- including a spot near where B. dorsalis was discovered in New York.

There are other possibilities. Adult parasitic wasps can live for 27 days, so they could have hitchhiked on a plane, Prior said.

Researchers don't yet know if these introduced species pose a hazard to native North American species. Other introduced parasite species are known to impact populations of native insects, she acknowledged.

""We did find that they can parasitize multiple oak gall wasp species and that they can spread, given that we know that the population in the west likely spread across regions and host species from a localized small introduction,"" Prior said. ""They could be affecting populations of native oak gall wasp species or other native parasites of oak gall wasps.""

Naturalists and citizen scientists play an important role in biodiversity research, such as the project that led to the discovery of the two B. dorsalis clades. Gall Week, a project hosted on the platform iNaturalist, encourages citizen scientists to collect galls during two seasons, and specimens from the NSF-funded study will be posted on the naturalist site Gallformers.org. Binghamton University ecology classes have participated in Gall Week, and also logged galls during University's annual Ecoblitz biodiversity event.

Biodiversity is a key component to healthy and functioning ecosystems -- and one that is increasingly under threat due to global change.

""Parasitic wasps are likely the most diverse group of animals on the planet and are extremely important in ecological systems, acting as biological control agents to keep insects in check, including those that are crop or forest pests,"" Prior explained.

A large portion of the global population with diabetes remains undiagnosed or is not receiving optimal care, according to a new study published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington School of Medicine and a global network of collaborators conducted the analysis of the diabetes care cascade for all ages, both sexes, and 204 countries and territories from 2000 to 2023.

In 2023, an estimated 44% of people aged 15 and older with diabetes are unaware of their condition. Underdiagnosis was greatest among young adults -- despite facing higher risks for long-term complications.

Among those who were diagnosed, 91% were on some form of pharmacological treatment. However, of those receiving treatment, only 42% had their blood sugar levels managed optimally. This translates to just 21% of all people with diabetes globally having their condition under optimal management.

Despite improvements over two decades, the research also found substantial regional diagnosis and treatment disparities, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. High-income North America had the highest rates of diagnosis, while high-income Asia Pacific showed the highest rates of treatment among diagnosed individuals. Southern Latin America had the highest rates of optimal blood sugar management among those treated. In contrast, Central sub-Saharan Africa faced the largest gaps in diagnosis, with less than 20% of people with diabetes being aware of their condition.

""By 2050, 1.3 billion people are expected to be living with diabetes, and if nearly half don't know they have a serious and potentially deadly health condition, it could easily become a silent epidemic,"" said Lauryn Stafford, first author and researcher at IHME.

Given the pace at which cases are rapidly rising, the research underscores the urgent need for investment in screening programs for younger populations and access to medications and glucose-monitoring tools, especially in underserved regions. In 2022, the WHO set a target to have 80% of people with diabetes clinically diagnosed by 2030.

The study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

After the clinical implementation of amyloid-β-targeting therapies for people with cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is an urgent need to efficiently identify this patient population in primary care. Therefore, we created a brief and self-administered digital cognitive test battery (BioCog). Based on its sub-scores, a logistic regression model was developed in a secondary care cohort (n = 223) and then evaluated in an independent primary care cohort comprising 19 primary care centers (n = 403). In primary care, BioCog had an accuracy of 85% when using a single cutoff to define cognitive impairment, which was significantly better than the assessment of primary care physicians (accuracy 73%). The accuracy increased to 90% when using a two-cutoff approach. BioCog had significantly higher accuracy than standard paper-and-pencil tests (that is, Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Mini-Cog) and another digital cognitive test. Furthermore, BioCog combined with a blood test could detect clinical, biomarker-verified AD with an accuracy of 90% (one cutoff), significantly better than standard-of-care (accuracy 70%) or when using the blood test alone (accuracy 80%). In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study shows that a brief, self-administered digital cognitive test battery can detect cognitive impairment and, when combined with a blood test, accurately identify clinical AD in primary care.

AD is the most common cause of dementia, characterized by depositions of amyloid-β (Aβ), aggregated tau and progressive neurodegeneration1. The clinical syndrome of AD typically starts with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), in which individuals report memory problems and/or other cognitive difficulties but perform normally on cognitive tests. This phase is followed by mild cognitive impairment (MCI), marked by objective cognitive symptoms, and later by dementia, characterized by clear functional deficits in activities of daily living2. Diagnosing AD is challenging, especially in the early stages of the disease and in primary care. The prevalence of both underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis is high with 20–30% of people being misdiagnosed in specialized care and approximately 40% in primary care when the AD diagnosis is not supported by biomarkers3,4,5,6. The implementation of biomarker testing such as positron emission tomography (PET) with Aβ aggregate-binding tracer or by lumbar puncture measuring concentrations of Aβ and tau in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has improved diagnostic precision in specialized clinics7,8,9. Nevertheless, these methods are either costly or invasive, and the availability is very limited globally. Recently, blood tests based on tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 (phosphorylated-tau217) have been shown to detect AD pathology with accuracies of around 90% in both primary and secondary care6, demonstrating performances comparable to clinically used CSF tests10. Therefore, blood tests for AD have the potential to revolutionize the diagnostic work-up of AD in people with cognitive symptoms, especially in primary care centers9,11.

The prevalence of AD brain pathology in the population varies by age and apolipoprotein E (APOE) status, but even more so by the severity of cognitive symptoms11. SCD can arise from a variety of causes, resulting in approximately only 20–25% of individuals with SCD exhibiting AD pathology. By contrast, about 40–60% of individuals with MCI and 70–80% with dementia have AD pathology12. As a result, the pretest probabilities vary by cognitive stage, resulting in lower positive predictive values (PPV) of AD biomarkers in people with SCD compared to those with dementia11,12. Consequently, a positive AD blood test in an individual with SCD carries a higher risk of being a false-positive than a positive result for an individual with cognitive impairment (MCI or dementia)6. The implications of such a false-positive result are substantial, because a person may be incorrectly informed of having AD associated with progressive cognitive decline in the coming years. Furthermore, only individuals with AD with cognitive impairment (but not SCD) are eligible for treatment with the newly implemented Aβ-targeting immunotherapies1,13,14,15. Biomarker testing in clinical practice is currently only recommended in patients with cognitive impairment1,3,13,16. This underscores the importance of identifying objective impairment (MCI and dementia) in individuals with cognitive symptoms, which in international guidelines is recommended to always precede AD biomarker testing5,11,17,18.

The administration and interpretation of cognitive tests vary substantially among primary care providers, both in and between countries. In addition, primary care providers often lack the time, expertise or resources to conduct assisted, in-clinic, cognitive tests19. Brief yet accurate digital cognitive testing, performed either remotely or unsupervised at the primary care center, may offer a viable solution to overcome this gap. We therefore developed a digital, self-administered, cognitive test battery (BioCog) and examined its ability to accurately identify cognitive impairment among people presenting with cognitive symptoms in primary care in a proof-of-concept study. Furthermore, we explored its utility when combined with a blood test to identify individuals with cognitive impairment due to AD.

We included 223 participants with cognitive symptoms from a secondary care cohort: the ongoing BioFINDER-2 study (NCT03174938) (Table 1)20. The mean (s.d.) age was 73 (8.8) years, 128 (57%) were male and 119 (53%) had objectively verified cognitive impairment. In addition, 403 participants were included from a primary care cohort, BioFINDER-Primary Care study (NCT06120361) (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1), which recruits people seeking help for cognitive symptoms at 19 primary care units6. Only people for whom the primary care physician (PCP) thought neurodegenerative disease was a reasonably possible cause of the symptomatology were invited to participate in the study. The mean (s.d.) age of the primary care cohort was 77 (8.0) years, 194 (48%) were male and 229 (57%) had objectively verified cognitive impairment.

Compared with secondary care, participants in the primary care cohort were older, had fewer years of education, a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease and hyperlipidemia, and a larger proportion were female. A slightly smaller proportion of participants in primary care were Aβ-positive and APOE ε4 carriers. Similar proportions were cognitively impaired (Table 1).

All participants performed the self-administered digital test battery, BioCog, comprising: (1) a word list test with immediate recall, delayed recall and recognition of ten words; (2) a cognitive processing speed task; and (3) questions about orientation to time (Supplementary Fig. 2). The study's primary outcome was objectively verified cognitive impairment determined on the basis of a standard battery of cognitive tests, the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), administered by neuropsychologists at a memory clinic. The secondary care cohort was used for training to establish cognitive test models and cutoffs. The primary care cohort was used for validation where the models and cutoffs were applied.

The subtests of BioCog demonstrated moderate negative Spearman's correlations with age (−0.31 to −0.58), and weak positive correlations with education (0.13 to 0.33). Performance across subtests did not differ by sex in either cohort, except for immediate recall and recognition in the primary care cohort, where female participants performed slightly better (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Strong correlations (0.57 to 0.83) were observed between BioCog subtests and their corresponding paper-and-pencil analogs (for example, BioCog processing speed test and Symbol Digit Modalities Test), supporting convergent validity. Correlations between individual BioCog subtests and a short-term memory task were weak (0.11 to 0.29). Similarly, only weak correlations were observed between BioCog subtests and a measure of visuoperceptual or spatial functioning (0.13 to 0.27), indicative of divergent validity (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Participants with cognitive impairment scored significantly lower on all BioCog measures compared to cognitively unimpaired individuals (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). Internal consistency of the subtests, estimated by McDonald's omega (ω), a reliability coefficient, ranged from acceptable to excellent (0.70 to 0.90) (Supplementary Table 7). Self-reported difficulty in understanding test instructions was very low (2%), and most participants reported that the tasks were engaging or were neutral (word list test 80%; processing speed test 91%) (Supplementary Fig. 3). Average completion time for BioCog was 11.2 min (s.d. 1.02 min), similarly across both cognitively unimpaired and cognitively impaired participants (Supplementary Table 8). Overall, these results suggest that BioCog is a valid, reliable and feasible tool for assessing cognitive function.

In the secondary care cohort, multiple logistic regression models that could predict the presence or absence of cognitive impairment were established using basic demographics (three variables: age, sex and education level) and BioCog (six variables from the subtests), in total nine variables (Supplementary Table 9). When creating models, recursive variable selection was performed to decrease the risk of overfitting. The best model based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) was selected. The model with lowest AIC included six variables (BioCog6): delayed ten-word recall (number of correct answers), cognitive processing speed task (number of correct answers), three repetitions of immediate ten-word recall (number of correct answers), age, delayed ten-word recognition (number of correct answers) and three repetitions of immediate ten-word recall (total time); listed in the order of feature importance.

For comparison, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves from BioCog6 (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.96) together with models containing all variables (BioCog9, AUC = 0.96, in addition including orientation to time (correct answers), education level and sex), or only the best performing single subtest (BioCog1, AUC = 0.91, only delayed ten-word recall), are provided in Fig. 1a. In the secondary care cohort, BioCog6 demonstrated an accuracy of 89% (95% confidence interval (CI) 84–93%), PPV of 91% (95% CI 85–95%), negative predictive value (NPV) of 88% (95% CI 81–93%), specificity of 89% (95% CI 83–95%) and sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 83–94%) for detection of cognitive impairment (Fig. 1b). Comparisons of true versus predicted classes are shown in a cross-tabulation analysis (Fig. 1c).

Error bars indicate 95% CI, with the center point corresponding to the mean value. c, Cross-tabulation analysis using BioCog6.

To enhance diagnostic performance, a two-cutoff approach (as previously proposed3,6,9,21,22,23) was applied using BioCog6. This way, participants with predicted probabilities close to the one-cutoff decision boundary formed an intermediate group and were not considered when evaluating performance (representing individuals who would need further evaluation to determine their cognitive status). The two-cutoff probabilities of 0.332 and 0.769 were chosen to achieve 95% sensitivity and 95% specificity, respectively. Using these cutoffs, BioCog6 had an accuracy of 96% (95% CI 92–98%), PPV of 96% (95% CI 91–99%), NPV of 96% (95% CI 90–98%), specificity of 96% (95% CI 90–98%) and sensitivity of 96% (95% CI 91–99%) (Extended Data Fig. 1). The intermediate group comprised 18% of the cohort (95% CI 12–22%).

Next, we evaluated the predictive ability of the previously established BioCog models and cutoffs in the independent primary care cohort. BioCog6 achieved higher or similar AUC (0.93) compared to BioCog1 (AUC = 0.88) and BioCog9 (AUC = 0.93) when identifying cognitive impairment (Fig. 2a). In the primary care cohort, BioCog6 had an accuracy of 85% (95% CI 81–89%), PPV of 87% (95% CI 82–91%), NPV of 83% (95% CI 77–89%), specificity of 82% (95% CI 75–87%) and sensitivity of 88% (95% CI 83–92%) (Fig. 2b). Of the 96 cognitively impaired participants without AD, 82 were correctly identified as impaired by the BioCog6 model (85% accuracy), suggesting similar performance in this subpopulation. The BioCog6 model was compared to standard assessment of PCPs (PCPcog), which included brief cognitive testing with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), computed tomography scan of the brain and a clinical assessment of the participant. BioCog6 had significantly higher performance across all evaluation metrics (Fig. 2b) (accuracy BioCog6 = 85% versus PCP = 73%; P < 0.001). Comparisons of true versus predicted classes for BioCog6 and PCPcog assessments can be seen in cross-tabulation analyses (Fig. 2c,d).

Nominal significance <0.0001 was set to 0.0001 during FDR correction, yielding a lowest adjusted P value of 0.0007.

Using two cutoffs (applying the cutoffs previously established in the secondary care cohort), BioCog6 showed an accuracy of 90% (95% CI 86–93%), PPV of 91% (95% CI 87–95%), NPV of 89% (95% CI 82–93%), specificity of 87% (95% CI 81–92%) and sensitivity of 92% (95% CI 88–95%) (Fig. 3). The intermediate group comprised 18% of the participants (95% CI 14–22%).

Next, a head-to-head comparison was performed between the BioCog6 model and several widely used standard paper-and-pencil tests (MMSE, MoCA, Mini-Cog) and another digital test (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB)). Using one cutoff, the BioCog6 model significantly outperformed all the other cognitive tests on accuracy (Table 2). This result remained consistent when cognitive tests were treated as continuous variables and adjusted for demographics (Supplementary Fig. 4). It also remained when removing age as an input in the BioCog6 model (Supplementary Table 10). For the two-cutoff approach, BioCog6 demonstrated significantly higher accuracy than MoCA, the only other test adapted for a two-cutoff approach (90% versus 76%, P = 0.001), and with a smaller, but not significantly different intermediate group size (18% versus 23%, P = 0.07).

Finally, we simulated a two-step diagnostic workflow in primary care that can be performed in addition to the standard clinical evaluation made by a physician to identify biomarker-verified clinical (symptomatic) AD: step 1, detection of objective cognitive impairment using BioCog (BioCog6); and step 2, blood biomarker testing (PrecivityAD2; Amyloid Probability Score-2 (APS2)) in those who are cognitively impaired according to BioCog (Fig. 4a). We compared this workflow in the primary care cohort against current standard clinical evaluation by PCPs, where the physician first assessed whether the patient had cognitive impairment and second, whether the impairment was caused by AD (PCPAD).

Comparisons were made on a subset of individuals with all existing data available (n = 365; see Supplementary Table 17 for detailed population characteristics). a, Our proposed primary care two-step workflow consisting of step 1, detection of cognitive impairment using the BioCog, followed by step 2 in cognitively impaired individuals, a blood biomarker assessment to evaluate whether AD pathology is present. b, Evaluation of the workflow using our BioCog6 model for step 1 and the plasma biomarker APS2 for step 2 (green). The workflow was compared against a standard clinical evaluation by PCPs in which the physician assesses both whether the patient had cognitive impairment (MCI or dementia) and whether the impairment was caused by AD (without any biomarkers) (PCPAD, orange), and against a workflow using only the plasma biomarker APS2 without any cognitive assessment (red). Error bars indicate 95% CI, with the center point corresponding to the mean value.

When cognitive impairment (based on neuropsychological assessment) and a clinical AD diagnosis (based on a consensus diagnosis done by dementia experts including CSF analysis or Aβ-PET assessments) was used as outcome, the two-step diagnostic workflow of BioCog (one cutoff) and blood biomarker achieved an overall clinical AD diagnostic accuracy of 90% (95% CI 86–92%), PPV of 83% (95% CI 75–89%), NPV of 93% (95% CI 89–95%), specificity of 92% (95% CI 88–95%) and sensitivity of 84% (95% CI 77–90%) (Fig. 4b). By contrast, PCPs had an overall accuracy of 70% (95% CI 65–74%), PPV of 52% (95% CI 43–61%), NPV of 79% (95% CI 73–84%), specificity of 76% (95% CI 71–81%) and sensitivity of 56% (95% CI 47–66%), all significantly lower than the new digital test and blood biomarker workflow (Fig. 4b).

In comparison, relying solely on the blood biomarker to identify clinical AD without using BioCog maintained a high sensitivity of 92% (95% CI 86–96%) and NPV of 95% (95% CI 92–98%), but showed significantly lower accuracy of 80% (95% CI 76–84%), PPV of 63% (95% CI 55–69%) and specificity of 75% (95% CI 69–80%) compared to the combined BioCog and blood biomarker workflow (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 11). Notably, a high proportion (17%) of individuals were classified as false positives when only using the blood test (Fig. 4e). Using the BioCog6 and APS2 workflow resulted in significantly higher accuracy than combining APS2 with the traditional cognitive assessments MMSE and MoCA (Supplementary Table 12).

If using a two-cutoff approach for both BioCog and the blood biomarker, the accuracy increased to 95% (95% CI 91–97%), with 30% (95% CI 25–34%) of individuals in the intermediate group (Supplementary Fig. 5). All results were similar when using cognitive impairment and an abnormal Aβ CSF or PET biomarker as outcome instead of a clinical AD diagnosis (Supplementary Fig. 5), and when applying the clinically used APS2 cutoff (Supplementary Fig. 6).

A Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score of ≥0.5 was evaluated as the reference standard for cognitive impairment instead of RBANS. When directly applying the BioCog6 model in the primary care cohort using this outcome, the performance remained high (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 13). The AUC decreased from 0.93 to 0.90, accuracy from 85% to 82%, and PPV from 87% to 86%. These results highlight the robustness and generalizability of the BioCog6 model in predicting cognitive impairment, also when using a different reference standard.

Additional evaluation metrics for the main analyses in the primary care cohort (including balanced accuracy, harmonic mean of precision and recall (F1 score), and positive and negative likelihood ratios) (Supplementary Tables 14 and 15) supported our main findings.

This study demonstrated that a brief digital cognitive assessment battery detects cognitive impairment with an accuracy of 85% when validated in an elderly primary care population presenting with cognitive symptoms. The accuracy of the self-administered BioCog test was significantly higher than that of standard-of-care methods, including paper-and-pencil tests MMSE, MoCA and Mini-Cog, which require the presence of healthcare personnel when administered. The digital test on its own also outperformed clinical evaluation by the PCP, which included patient history and standard cognitive tests. Notably, higher performance was consistent whether cognitive impairment was defined using RBANS or CDR, underscoring BioCog's robustness and generalizability in detecting objective cognitive impairment. Furthermore, in a two-step workflow combining BioCog with a blood biomarker test, clinical AD (that is, cognitive impairment due to AD) could be identified with significantly higher accuracy than the standard PCP assessment (90% versus 70%), or using a blood biomarker test without previous digital cognitive assessment (90% versus 80%). Beyond high accuracy, digital tests like BioCog offer distinct advantages over paper-and-pencil assessments. BioCog enables time-efficient cognitive evaluations and eliminates variability introduced by differences in scoring or interpretation, which are critical features in primary care19. Furthermore, it facilitates the simultaneous collection of different variable categories, such as time, alongside correct answers, allowing for more comprehensive data. Digital platforms also make it easier to utilize advanced statistical models, moving beyond simple threshold-based scoring of sums (used in MMSE, MoCA and Mini-Cog) to leverage more nuanced, data-driven insights without adding significant processing time or requiring advanced interpretation skills.

Compared to another digital test that has been CE marked and US Food and Drug Administration approved and is currently used in clinical practice for dementia evaluations (CANTAB), BioCog demonstrated significantly higher accuracy in identifying cognitive impairment (85% versus 76%) (Table 2). Our study did not evaluate all available digital tablet solutions, such as Cognivue24, NIH Toolbox25, cCOG26, Cogstate27 or TabCAT28, considering the load this would impose on participants, and to avoid learning biases. To our knowledge, none of these digital tests have been evaluated in primary care. Future research comparing various brief and self-administered digital tools in primary care will be essential to ensure that clinicians have access to the most effective options for detecting cognitive impairment. Importantly, a central conclusion of this study is that combining digital cognitive testing and a blood biomarker can enhance not only the efficiency of the diagnostic process in primary care, but also the diagnostic certainty of AD.

A diagnostic workflow (Fig. 4) combining a positive BioCog assessment with an accurate blood biomarker test offers an efficient and reliable way to diagnose clinical AD with high certainty (accuracy of 90% compared to 70% for current standard-of-care without biomarkers and 80% for blood biomarkers only). These results suggest that digital cognitive tests, when combined with blood biomarker tests, have potential to significantly enhance the clinical work-up of AD and can become highly valuable to efficiently align clinical AD diagnostics with global recommendations. The World Health Organization's preferred product profile for AD blood tests emphasizes that such tests should be used exclusively in individuals with cognitive impairment17, where the pretest probability is high enough to achieve a PPV of >90% without the need for confirmatory CSF or PET biomarkers. This aligns with other international recommendations11,16. In addition, only individuals with cognitive impairment are eligible for treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or recently developed Aβ-targeting immunotherapies1,13,14,15. This also underscores the importance of identifying cognitive impairment in primary care with efficient and accurate tools like BioCog, to enable referral of as many eligible patients as possible to specialist clinics for treatment with Aβ immunotherapies without substantial burden on the primary care system. Further evaluation (for example magnetic resonance imaging scans, APOE, contraindicated medications) of potential treatment candidates is required at specialty clinics before initiating treatment29.

For digital assessments and blood tests to be effective in diagnosing clinical AD, it is essential that they demonstrate very high PPVs, particularly before initiating expensive treatments. In addition, it is of high importance that their predictive properties are robust, with strong generalization to new patients. Blood biomarker tests have shown high performance across many secondary care cohorts9,30, as well as in primary care11, but their PPV varies by age and cognitive status because of differences in pretest probabilities31, so their use should be adapted to the clinical context. In this study, using BioCog to assess cognitive impairment expectedly showed a slight decrease in performance between the secondary care cohort (used to fit the model, AUC = 0.96 and PPV = 91%) and the more clinically diverse primary care cohort (only used for model evaluation, AUC = 0.93 and PPV = 87%). To develop a robust BioCog model, we applied recursive feature selection with AIC penalization and focused on external model validation in the independent primary care cohort.

We also investigated the ability of BioCog6 to identify cognitive impairment with CDR as outcome instead of RBANS. Whereas RBANS offers a more objective measure of cognitive impairment, CDR captures functional decline32,33. Both are widely used in clinical trials and routine clinical practice14,15,34,35. When using a CDR global score ≥0.5 as outcome, performance remained high, with only a slight decrease (for example, accuracy from 85% to 82%, and PPV from 87% to 86%). Because the BioCog6 model was optimized to detect cognitive impairment (RBANS) and not functional impairment (CDR), a drop in performance is expected. Nevertheless, this decrease was minimal, and BioCog6 still outperformed both the clinical judgment of PCPs and other cognitive tests. To further increase diagnostic performance of the BioCog6 model, we applied a two-cutoff approach, which resulted in a PPV that remained >90% even in primary care and with 18% of individuals in the intermediate group. These results are encouraging, with BioCog demonstrating a high level of robustness and adaptability, even when applied to a cohort with differing demographic characteristics and a higher prevalence of comorbidities (Table 1), and when defining cognitive impairment using a different reference standard. For the two-cutoff approach, people with intermediate results would need more comprehensive cognitive evaluations. Alternatively, repeated cognitive testing incorporating changes in test scores may help identify cognitive impairment in those individuals36.

The findings of our study highlight the key role digital cognitive tools can play in optimizing diagnostic workflows, particularly when combined with blood biomarker tests for a more precise evaluation of clinical AD. Beyond individual test performance, the broader impact of digital assessments lies in their ability to enhance efficiency, standardization and scalability in cognitive assessments37. Importantly, their greatest value emerges when integrated into a broader clinical evaluation, in which results can be interpreted alongside other clinical information to support well-informed diagnostic decisions and strengthen the healthcare professional's confidence in making a correct diagnosis38. Even though this study focuses on highlighting the clinical value of BioCog by showing its independent contribution in identifying objective cognitive impairment and clinical AD, our proposal is not to use BioCog or other digital tests as stand-alone tools. BioCog is aimed to complement, not replace, clinical judgment, and further validation in additional research studies and integration into structured care pathways is essential before deployment. In addition, future implementation-based research in different healthcare systems is needed to evaluate the impact on clinical management and to establish clinical practice guidelines before digital assessments combined with blood biomarkers can be used as part of everyday primary care in real-world settings.

There are limitations to this study. First, we established the BioCog model in a secondary care cohort, which differed on demographic factors like age and education level, and on comorbidity prevalence compared to the primary care cohort, representative of the intended use population. However, the robust results across cohorts despite these differences also highlight the generalizability of the model and cutoffs. Second, although BioCog performed well in identifying cognitive impairment, further research is needed to evaluate its utility in longitudinal settings and its ability to monitor disease progression. Third, BioCog was developed and evaluated in Swedish cohorts. It has been translated into several languages, including English, Finnish, Dutch and Spanish, and validation in these languages and in more diverse populations is important to further assess the generalizability. Such validation will be crucial before clinical implementation. Notably, paper-and-pencil versions of similar types of tests have performed very well across different languages and cultures. Fourth, this study did not directly assess how the use of a digital tool influences the clinical work-up in primary care, or whether physicians find it beneficial in practice. These questions will be addressed in future work. Fifth, BioCog was not evaluated as a screening tool for the general population. Instead, it was assessed in individuals who presented with cognitive complaints in primary care, where a physician considered a neurodegenerative disease to be a possible cause. People whose symptoms were clearly attributable to other causes (for example, depression or sleep disorders) were treated or referred accordingly and were not included in the study. This limits our ability to assess BioCog's utility for screening of the general population. However, such screening currently lacks evidence for improving decision-making or other important outcomes39. We therefore argue that the current study, limited to participants with cognitive symptoms possibly caused by an underlying neurodegenerative disease, is clinically more relevant and reflects a realistic scenario for how digital cognitive tools may be integrated to support physicians in primary care.

In summary, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that a self-administered digital test is effective for identifying objective cognitive impairment in a population with cognitive symptoms for whom the PCP thought a neurodegenerative disease was a possible cause of the symptomatology. Furthermore, when combined with a blood biomarker test, the digital cognitive test could reliably diagnose clinical AD with high accuracy, outperforming the current standard-of-care in primary care. These findings have the potential to transform clinical diagnostics of AD in primary care, enabling detection and treatment in a resource efficient manner.

All participants provided written informed consent before enrollment in the study, and ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority. Participants from two cohorts were included, one from secondary care and one from primary care. Data for this study were collected between February 2022 and December 2024. The secondary care cohort was used as the training cohort to establish cognitive test models and cutoffs. The primary care cohort was used as the validation cohort were the models and cutoffs were applied.

Secondary care participants were recruited from the ongoing BioFINDER-2 study (NCT03174938), described in detail elsewhere20. Briefly, the study consecutively enrolls participants at the secondary care memory clinic of Skåne University Hospital and the memory clinic of Ängelholm Hospital, and includes a diverse population of study participants. For the current study, patients with either SCD, MCI or dementia were included. Further details are given in the Supplementary Methods.

The BioFINDER-Primary Care study (NCT06120361), described previously6, is an ongoing study that recruits patients from primary care centers in southern Sweden. The study consecutively includes patients seeking medical help due to cognitive symptoms either self-reported or reported by a close relative or spouse. In addition, inclusion may also be initiated based on the PCP's suspicion of a neurocognitive disorder. To ensure a realistic and ethical study design aligned with standard care, the primary care cohort included only individuals for whom the treating PCPs, after the first assessment, considered a potential neurodegenerative disease. People whose symptoms were assessed to be clearly attributable to other causes (for example, depression, sleep disorders) were not enrolled and instead treated at the primary center or referred for appropriate care elsewhere. Patients already diagnosed with dementia or suffering from an unstable severe systemic illness as well as those with ongoing significant alcohol or substance abuse were excluded. At their respective primary care center, patients underwent standard clinical evaluation (‘standard-of-care'), including medical examination by the PCP, cognitive testing, standard blood assessments to rule out other causes and structural brain imaging. Based on the assessments of PCPs, only 29.1% (106 of 364) of the participants would have been referred to secondary care if not included in this study, underscoring that the primary and secondary care cohorts represented different patient populations. For this study patients from 19 primary care centers were included. Further details of the cohort, cognitive testing and inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in Supplementary Methods.

The digital cognitive battery, BioCog, was developed using Python and Kivy to run on an Android tablet. The battery was designed to include a primary part and an optional secondary part that contained more demanding tasks (and was therefore not used in this study). During development of the battery, it was tested by cognitively unimpaired volunteers to improve the user experience. Following this pilot phase, participants in the BioFINDER-Primary Care study completed the battery and provided feedback on how they perceived the tasks and instruction comprehensibility. After additional adjustments, digital testing was introduced in the study design and data collection started. None of the participants in this study had previous experience with the BioCog test battery. The first part of the self-administered test battery, which was used in the current study, had an average completion time of 11.2 min, and is comprised of a word list test with immediate and delayed recall as well as a delayed recognition part, a cognitive processing speed task and questions about orientation to the weekday, date, month and year.

To evaluate the performance of the digital test to detect cognitive impairment, it was compared to paper-and-pencil tests frequently used in primary care settings (which require healthcare personal to perform the tests) and to a well-known, CE marked and US Food and Drug Administration approved digital test. The brief paper-and-pencil tests used, were: (1) the MMSE40, the world's most used cognitive test, which consists of several shorter tasks and has a maximum score of 30 points; (2) MoCA41, a widely used screening tool with a maximum of 30 points, which evaluates a broader range of cognitive domains than the MMSE; (3), Mini-Cog42, which was developed as a very brief screening test that includes a three-word delayed recall task and clock drawing and has a maximum of 5 points; and (4) the digital, tablet-based paired associates learning task (PAL)43 from the CANTAB, which measures visual associative memory. For the main analyses, externally established and validated cutoffs were used for all measures: MMSE <27 points44, MoCA <26 points41, Mini-Cog <4 points45 and for PAL >41 adjusted errors in total46. For MoCA a two-cutoff approach was also included using <24 points as the lower cutoff and 26 as the upper cutoff21. For the other tests no validated two-cutoff approaches were available. As sensitivity analyses, the cognitive tests were treated as continuous variables and adjusted for demographics.

The standard clinical evaluation at the primary care units included brief cognitive testing (MMSE and MoCA), computed tomography scan of the brain, and a clinical assessment of the patient. After completing this evaluation, PCPs were asked to report the cognitive stage (SCD, MCI or dementia) and if assessed as MCI or dementia, the most likely cause of the cognitive impairment. The latter was binarized as AD or non-AD. Mixed etiologies including AD (for example, AD with vascular co-pathology) were coded as AD.

Blood was collected in EDTA tubes and centrifuged within 1 h. Plasma was then pipetted to 1-ml LoBind tubes and shipped the same day to be frozen at −80 °C. Plasma samples were then shipped to and analyzed by C2N Diagnostics in the United States continuously during the study period (47 occasions). Mass spectrometry assays were used to analyze Aβ42, Aβ40, phosphorylated-tau217 and nonphosphorylated-tau217, as previously described6. These biomarkers were combined in a logistic regression model (PrecivityAD2 test) to yield a score from 0 to 100 called the APS2 (ref. 47). An APS2 cutoff value of 36 was used, previously defined in a clinical practice research study established at 90% specificity for AD pathology6. In addition, a two-cutoff approach with values corresponding to 95% sensitivity and 95% specificity (31 lower, 62 upper) was used, also previously defined6.

The primary outcome was objectively verified cognitive impairment. In the primary care cohort, this was established using the RBANS48, administered by neuropsychologists at the memory clinic of Skåne University Hospital. The RBANS is a widely used cognitive test battery that has shown high accuracy in detecting and characterizing cognitive deficits associated with AD49 and MCI in general50. The test battery comprises 12 subtests assessing 5 cognitive domains: immediate and delayed memory, visuospatial and visuoconstructional ability, verbal ability and attention, and requires about 30 min to perform. Using normative data from the Swedish manual generated an age-corrected standard (M = 100, s.d. = 15) total scale score for each participant. Based on the widely accepted neuropsychological criteria for defining cognitive impairment51,52, participants with an RBANS total scale score of 1.5 s.d. below the normative mean or less were considered cognitively impaired. In the secondary care cohort, RBANS was not available. Instead, an RBANS proxy variable was created, based on similar paper-and-pencil neuropsychological tests (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 18). The RBANS proxy was used as outcome in the secondary care cohort.

The secondary outcome ‘clinical AD' was defined as having cognitive impairment (as described above) where AD was determined as the primary etiology. The latter was determined in consensus discussions including dementia specialists and neuropsychologists. The consensus discussions included access to medical examination by a dementia specialist at the memory clinic, a computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain, CSF AD biomarkers or Aβ-PET results as well as neuropsychological assessment (Supplementary Methods). The diagnosis of clinical AD was defined in accordance with criteria from the International Working Group13, which includes a typical clinical presentation of AD in patients with objective cognitive impairment and confirmation with AD biomarkers. Participants fulfilling the criteria for clinical AD but also having signs of other concomitant diseases (for example, AD mixed with vascular disease) were labeled as having clinical AD in the analyses. Individuals that were negative according to this outcome were either cognitively unimpaired or cognitively impaired not due to AD (see Supplementary Table 16 for details of comorbidities and diagnoses).

The CDR scale is a semiobjective, qualitative staging instrument for the assessment dementia severity32. It assesses the cognitive and functional performance of everyday activities in six categories: memory, orientation, judgment and problem-solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, as well as personal affairs. Each item in the respective subscales is rated and a global CDR score is derived. A score of 0 is considered normal, with a score of 0.5, 1, 2 or 3 indicating questionable, mild, moderate and severe dementia33. Participants with a CDR global score of 0.5 and above were considered cognitively impaired and this was used as an outcome in the sensitivity analysis. In this study, CDR was performed by a dementia specialist at the memory clinic blinded to BioCog.

The analyses were performed in Python v.3.9. Multiple logistic regression models were created, and cutoffs were established in the secondary care cohort. Model performance was then evaluated in the same cohort, and more importantly, in the external and completely independent primary care cohort. To decrease the risk of overfitting when creating multiple logistic regression models, the number of input variables was reduced with recursive feature elimination based on the standardized logistic regression model coefficients. The best model was selected using the AIC, requiring a decrease of 2 or more in AIC to indicate a better model fit and justifying the addition of another input variable53,54. Model performance was evaluated from the ROC AUC. Cutoffs were established for the probabilities from the logistic regression models. An optimal cutoff point was selected based on the maximum value of Youden's index and the corresponding model was evaluated on accuracy, PPV, NPV, specificity and sensitivity. For the two-cutoff approach, cutoffs were selected based on 95% specificity and 95% sensitivity in the independent secondary care cohort. Participants in the intermediate group were not considered when evaluating model performance. The 95% CI and two-sided P values were computed using bootstrapping (n = 5,000 resamples with replacement), with a P value <0.05 indicating statistical significance. P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons by the Benjamini–Hochberg method. Differences between cognitively unimpaired and cognitively impaired on the various subtests of BioCog were assessed using the Mann–Whitney U-test. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were used to evaluate associations between BioCog subtests and their paper-and-pencil counterparts, as well as with age and education. Internal consistency was assessed using McDonald's ω.

When sensory information is incomplete, the brain relies on prior expectations to infer perceptual objects. Despite the centrality of this process to perception, the neural mechanisms of sensory inference are not understood. Here we used illusory contours (ICs), multi-Neuropixels measurements, mesoscale two-photon (2p) calcium imaging and 2p holographic optogenetics in mice to reveal the neural codes and circuits of sensory inference. We discovered a specialized subset of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) that respond emergently to illusory bars but not to component image segments. Selective holographic photoactivation of these ‘IC-encoders' recreated the visual representation of ICs in V1 in the absence of any visual stimulus. These data imply that neurons that encode sensory inference are specialized for receiving and locally broadcasting top-down information. More generally, pattern completion circuits in lower cortical areas may selectively reinforce activity patterns that match prior expectations, constituting an integral step in perceptual inference.

Illusions arise from rational mistakes in sensory inference. For example, a rational perceptual interpretation of the classic Kanizsa illusion is that of a white triangle in front of three black circles (Fig. 1a)1. The nervous system likely evolved to rely on inference because we must frequently infer objects from partial information, such as during occlusion2. Many species, including humans, nonhuman primates, mice, fish and even insects, perceive illusory contours (ICs), implying that sensory inference is fundamental to perception3,4,5,6,7,8. For example, mice trained to perform an orientation discrimination task on real edges can generalize their performance to ICs and vice versa6,7.

Position 1 corresponds to the gap region in the stimuli in b (right; for reference, the nine positions in the receptive field mapping block are shown on top of the default image from the IC block). Note that 16° is slightly larger than the typical size of receptive fields in mouse V1. d, Schematic of six Neuropixels probes insertion into V1, LM, RL, AL, PM and AM (12 sessions from 12 mice). e, Receptive field map for V1 regular-spiking (RS) units that exclusively responded to grating patches in position 1, corresponding to the illusory gap region (n = 18 exclusively center-responsive neurons; 12 sessions from 12 mice). f, PSTHs of exclusively center-responsive V1 RS units on IC and IRE trials, for preferred IRE orientation and corresponding IC trials.

Illusions are uniquely suited for dissociating faithfulness from inference-based sensory representations in the brain. Pioneering work in the primate visual cortex (V1) identified neurons that responded to ICs as if they were real edges, despite the lack of any actual contrast in their receptive fields9,10,11. Such responses may represent a neural correlate of emergent, or Gestalt, perception, in which the perceived whole is greater than the sum of its parts (or sensory inputs). While lower visual cortical areas are primarily faithful to image segments, higher visual areas show stronger emergent representations of the ICs12,13,14. Furthermore, recent studies in mice showed that optogenetic silencing of a higher visual area (lateromedial area, LM) during IC presentation reduced IC-evoked responses in V1 (refs. 7,15). These data support a model where circuits in higher cortical areas first compute the presence of ICs and then feed back these representations as predictive inferences to lower cortical areas16,17. However, it remains unclear why sensory predictions are fed back to V1 at all.

To address the neocortical mechanism of sensory inference, we used large-scale neurophysiological methods to record and manipulate neural activity from awake mice viewing images that contain ICs. We used mesoscale two-photon (2p) calcium imaging, multi-Neuropixels extracellular electrophysiology recordings, 2p holographic optogenetics and a new 2p holographic mesoscope18. With large-scale neural recordings, we investigated how neural decoders trained to discriminate between IC stimuli generalized their performance to the discrimination of real edge stimuli. We found robust representations of IC inference in layer 2/3 (L2/3) of V1 and LM, but not in layer 4 (L4) of V1. In V1L2/3, a selected subset of neurons that responded emergently to the IC (‘IC-encoders') mediated the representation of IC inference. To test whether these IC-encoders could drive IC representations within V1L2/3 on their own, we holographically photoactivated them in the absence of any visual stimulus. We found that photoactivating IC-encoders recreated IC representations within V1L2/3 through pattern completion. These results imply that neurons that encode top-down inference signals locally broadcast those signals through pattern completion. On the other hand, neurons that respond to the individual inducing segments of the IC (‘segment responders') drove IC representations in higher visual areas but not within V1L2/3. Taken together, recurrent activity through feedforward, feedback and local pattern completion circuits may facilitate sensory inference by reinforcing activity patterns that match the brain's prior expectations about the sensory world.

Using two high-throughput neural recording techniques with complementary strengths, multi-Neuropixels and large-scale 2p imaging, we recorded the neural activity of awake, head-fixed mice while presenting the animals with various images containing real edges or ICs (IC denotes ‘I-shaped combination', IRE denotes ‘I-shaped real edge'; Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1).

First, we asked if we could identify visual cortical neurons that respond to ICs even in the absence of any contrast within their receptive fields, as previously shown in primates9,10,14. We focused on V1 neurons whose receptive fields are contained entirely within the gap region. If these neurons are driven by ICs, then their visually evoked activity is, by definition, not bottom up7,9,10,14. Thus, we selected only those neurons that responded exclusively to the illusory gap region, that is, the central 16 visual degree region of the visual presentation monitor (Fig. 1e,i). We then examined the response of these exclusively center-responsive V1 neurons to IC-containing images (IC), in comparison to nearly identical images where the ICs are replaced with real edges (‘IRE images'; note that the thickness of the outline edge was ≥2°, which is detectable by mice19). As expected, these neurons responded more strongly to IRE trials because there was actual contrast within their receptive fields. Notably, a substantial portion of these neurons also responded on IC trials, despite having no contrast within their receptive fields (Fig. 1f,j). Furthermore, there was a strong degree of overlap in the orientation preference for illusory bars in IC images and real bars in IRE images, where the preferred IC and IRE orientation was defined as the orientation of the illusory bar in IC images and the real bar in IRE images that evoked the strongest mean response (Fig. 1g,k).

These results demonstrate that mouse V1 contains neurons that respond to illusory bars as if they were real bars, in an orientation selective manner, despite the lack of contrast in their receptive field. These results were consistent between the Neuropixels dataset and the 2p calcium imaging dataset. Moreover, these results did not change when limiting the analyses to trials where the mouse's eye position stayed within eight visual degrees of the modal eye position, indicating that eye movements did not affect this conclusion (Extended Data Fig. 2). We further verified the illusory bar responsiveness and orientation selectivity for exclusively center-responsive V1 neurons using larger illusory gap sizes (Extended Data Fig. 3a–d), denser receptive field mappings (Extended Data Fig. 3e–h) and contrast bars instead of outline bars for determining orientation selectivity (Extended Data Fig. 3i–n). Taken together, V1 neurons with receptive fields within the illusory gap region can respond to illusory bars with the same orientation selectivity as to real bars.

Although the classical definition of IC encoding neurons are neurons whose receptive field is contained within the gap region of the IC7,9,10,14, neurons with receptive fields that overlap with one of the inducer segments could still be sensitive to the presence of the IC. If this were true, these neurons would be sensitive to the global arrangement of inducer elements that are outside their receptive fields. Indeed, several recent studies show that mouse V1 neurons are highly sensitive to contextual information outside their classical receptive fields, suggesting that neurons that are exclusively responsive to visual information within their classical receptive field may be more of an exception than the norm20,21,22,23. Thus, we sought to identify neurons that selectively encode ICs as a global emergent feature of the image, irrespective of their receptive fields.

To test this notion, we needed to design a set of visual stimuli that would distinguish between cells that simply responded to low-level features of the image per se (that is, one of the inducer segments), as opposed to the emergent IC inference. It is essential to rule out low-level image differences when identifying IC encoding neurons, such that the neural representation can be interpreted appropriately as representing sensory inference. To address this challenge, we devised a new set of four stimuli that could disambiguate low-level from emergent responses (Fig. 2a). Two of the stimuli contained illusory bars (IC1, IC2), while the other two were constructed by recombining the upper and lower halves of the first two images, such that the illusory bars were eliminated (‘L-shaped combination', LC1, LC2). Thus, LC1 is composed of the bottom two inducers of IC1 and the top two inducers of IC2, and vice versa for LC2. This design ensured that response selectivity for one of the four images could not be explained by sensitivity to the component inducer segments; instead, it can only be explained by sensitivity to a global feature of the image. Using these stimuli, we identified approximately 4.3% of neurons in V1L2/3 with selectivity for one of the two IC images, and no substantial responses to either LC image (P < 0.05 Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Tukey–Kramer correction for multiple comparisons; 8.5% for both configurations of white-circles-on-black-background, that is, four IC orientations; Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 1).

a, IC1 and IC2 images, respectively, contain a 135° and 45° illusory bar. LC1 image is constructed from bottom half of IC1 and top half of IC2, and LC2 is constructed from top half of IC1 and bottom half of IC2. Segment images contain individual segments of the IC and LC images (BR, BL, TL and TR). b, IC-encoders are defined as neurons that respond to one of the IC images and to neither of the LC images (left; two panels). Segment responders are defined as neurons that respond more to the inward than to the outward segment in each position (right; two panels). Average evoked responses of IC-encoders and segment responders to IC and LC images are shown as heatmaps (2p imaging dataset with V1L2/3 field-of-view, 24 sessions from four mice). Calcium traces of an example IC1-encoder and an example BR-segment responder neuron are shown (mean ± s.e.m. across corresponding image presentation trials). c, Orientation tuning of IC-encoders, measured with single long bars (left), averaged over each IC-encoder subgroup (P = 1.8 × 10−5 Wilcoxon signed-rank test between the orientation of the illusory bar vs. the orthogonal orientation; 2p imaging dataset with V1L2/3 field-of-view, 11 sessions from five mice). Orientation increases in the clockwise direction, and 0° is defined as the vertical orientation. Y axis denotes the orientation of the illusory bar in the IC image that the IC-encoder is selective for. Of note, 135° and 45° IC images correspond to IC1 and IC2 images, respectively, and 90° and 0° IC images were shown in a separate block within the same recording session. d, Putative excitatory connections are determined as suprathreshold peaks in the cross-correlograms between RS units (example on the left). V1 IC-encoders (n = 79) are substantially more likely than V1 segment responders (n = 526) to receive putative excitatory connections from higher visual areas (LM, RL, AL, PM and AM). All box-and-whisker plots are formatted as follows: centerline, median; box limits, upper and lower quartiles; whiskers, 1.5× interquartile range; points, outliers (Wilcoxon rank-sum test P = 7.0 × 10−6; 12 sessions from 12 mice). Ex., example; enc., encoder; seg., segment; suprathresh., suprathreshold; ori., orientation.

The defining feature of IC-encoders is that they respond to specific combinations of inducing segments. Conversely, neurons that respond to the individual segments per se are defined as ‘segment responders'; these neurons are substantially more responsive to inward than to outward orientation of each segment (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Fig. 2a). We identified segment responders in each quadrant—bottom-right (BR), bottom-left (BL), top-left (TL) and top-right (TR). Because each quadrant was shared by one of the IC images and one of the LC images, segment responders responded equally to an IC image and an LC image (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 1).

To test whether IC-encoders are selective to the illusory bar in the IC image, we examined the orientation tuning of these neurons using single line images (Fig. 2c). Indeed, IC-encoders in V1L2/3 were tuned to the orientation of the illusory bar in the IC image (IC1-encoders were tuned to 135°, and IC2-encoders were tuned to 45°). Interestingly, although some of these neurons had receptive fields that mapped to the gap region of the IC, many did not (Extended Data Fig. 4a–g). This indicates that emergent responses to the illusory bar are not constrained to neurons with receptive fields on the illusory gap region. Furthermore, IC-encoders did not have substantially larger receptive fields compared to other neurons in V1L2/3, arguing that IC-encoders' selectivity to ICs cannot be attributed to feedforward convergence of sensory information across the illusory gap region (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). In addition, eye movement was largely constrained within the gap region and was not biased across images, suggesting that eye movements did not influence IC-encoders' specificity to ICs (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Together, these results imply that bottom-up visual inputs cannot fully account for IC-encoders' responses to ICs in V1L2/3.

Top-down corticocortical feedback generates IC encoding in V1 in both primates and mice7,14,15,16,17. This leads to the prediction that IC-encoders receive IC inference signals through top-down feedback from higher visual areas. To test this, we leveraged the large-scale nature of the Neuropixels dataset to perform a cross-correlogram analysis as an estimate of connectivity between higher visual areas and V1 (12 sessions from 12 mice; mean ± s.e.m. = 150 ± 20 V1 RS units and 597 ± 46 higher visual area RS units across sessions). Following a prior approach, we deemed a sharp peak with a short latency in the cross-correlogram exceeding a certain threshold to be a putative excitatory connection (Fig. 2d, left; Methods)24,25. Under this analysis, we found that V1 IC-encoders received substantially more putative excitatory inputs from higher visual areas, compared to V1 segment responders (Fig. 2d).

To understand how IC inference is computed at the microcircuit level, we then sought to determine where in the visual hierarchy this computation occurs. In primates, this top-down information is thought to come from V2 and the ventral stream13,14. In mice, the functional specialization of higher visual areas is less clear, although a recent optogenetics study has shown that LM contributes to IC responses in V1 (ref. 7). Perhaps more notably, in both primates and mice, it is unclear whether V1 is the lowest region in the visual hierarchy where IC responses emerge. To address these questions, we recorded from six visual cortical areas simultaneously (V1, LM, anterolateral (AL), rostrolateral (RL), anteromedial (AM) and posteromedial (PM)), by targeting six Neuropixels probes to each area (n = 12 sessions from 12 mice), or by using a 2p mesoscope for calcium imaging in a separate cohort of mice (n = 19 sessions from 5 CaMKII-tTA;tetO-GcaMP6s mice; Supplementary Fig. 2). We also compared V1L2/3 (n = 11 sessions from five CaMKII-tTA;tetO-GcaMP6s mice) and V1L4 (n = 8 sessions from two Scnn1a-Tg3-Cre;TIT2L-GC6s-ICL-tTA2 mice) using multiplane imaging in a standard 2p microscope. Using the same approach as above for V1, we could identify IC-encoders throughout these visual areas both in the electrophysiology and in the calcium imaging datasets (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d).

Owing to the high-throughput nature of our recording techniques, we could apply powerful multivariate approaches that can test for the representation of IC inference comprehensively. We trained neural decoders (linear support vector machines, SVMs) to classify visual evoked neural activity patterns into corresponding visual labels for the four trial types described above (IC1, LC1, LC2 and IC2 trials; chance performance is 0.25). The tenfold cross-validation performance was substantially above chance, indicating that neural activity patterns evoked by these four images were highly distinct at the multivariate level (Fig. 3a).

The confusion matrix shows the average decoding performance of V1 neurons in the Neuropixels dataset (n = 12 sessions from 12 mice; average 150 V1 RS units per session, 400 repetitions per trial type). b, The stimuli used for assessing inference decoding.

Green, IC; orange, LC. e, Inference decoding of the 2p dataset. The proportion of TRE trials that are decoded as the corresponding IC (green) and LC (orange) images were averaged across the two image sets (mean ± s.e.m. across sessions, *P < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; 8 sessions with V1L4 field-of-view, 11 sessions with V1L2/3 field-of-view and 19 sessions with mesoscope field-of-view; for each visual area, only sessions ≥100 neurons in that area are included, which leaves n = 8, 11, 19, 8, 15, 2, 6, 1 sessions with P = 0.3125, 0.0049, 0.0196, 0.0391, 0.2293, 1.0000, 0.4375, 1.0000 for V1L4, V1L2/3, mesoscope V1, LM, RL, AL, PM and AM, respectively).

To test whether IC inference is represented in the visually evoked neural activity patterns, we designed two new images to probe the neural decoder with, called ‘TRE images' (Fig. 3b). TRE1 has equal pixel overlap with IC1 and LC1, and, correspondingly, TRE2 has equal pixel overlap with IC2 and LC2. TRE images contain explicit real edges, unlike any of the four stimuli used to train the decoder (IC1, LC1, LC2 and IC2). If visually evoked activity patterns were faithful to the images, decoder output would simply reflect the overlap between the probe images (TRE1 and TRE2) and the training images (IC1, LC1, LC2 and IC2). Thus, the decoder would be equally likely to classify TRE-evoked neural activity patterns as IC or LC. On the contrary, if IC inference was represented in IC-evoked activity, the corresponding activity pattern would emulate the representation of the real edge in the TRE-evoked activity. Thus, if a brain area contained IC inference signals, the TRE-response in that area would be more similar to the IC-response than to the LC-response. To quantify this effect, we computed the difference in the classification of TRE as IC vs. LC (averaged across the two image sets). We termed this analysis ‘inference decoding'. Applying inference decoding to Neuropixels V1 recordings revealed that TRE was substantially more likely to be decoded as IC than as LC (Fig. 3c; decoding probability for IC vs. LC was 0.51 vs. 0.22, P < 0.05 Wilcoxon signed-rank test). This result indicates that IC inference is represented in mouse V1.

To narrow down the lowest region of the visual hierarchy where the inference signal is encoded, we used 2p imaging to examine V1L4 and L2/3 separately. Whereas V1L2/3 showed substantial inference decoding performance, V1L4 did not (Fig. 3e). This result is consistent with the notion that V1L4, as the primary thalamo-recipient layer, is more faithful to sensory information than V1L2/3. Critically, it implies that V1L2/3 is the lowest region in the visual hierarchy where IC inference is represented.

Next, we applied TRE inference decoding to identify higher visual areas that participate in IC encoding (Fig. 3d,e; *P < 0.05 Wilcoxon signed-rank test). In the Neuropixels dataset, almost every visual area was substantially biased toward decoding TRE as IC than LC, with V1, LM and AL showing the strongest representations of the IC (Fig. 3d). Similarly, L2/3 of V1 and LM showed the strongest IC representation in the 2p mesoscope dataset (Fig. 3e). The difference in effect sizes between the 2p imaging and the Neuropixels data likely stems from inherent differences in signal-to-noise ratio between calcium imaging and extracellular electrophysiology.

Prior behavioral work has shown that mice trained on real edges could generalize to ICs6, and, conversely, mice trained on ICs could generalize to real edges7. Analogously, we developed a complementary inference decoding approach where the neural decoder was trained on real edges and then probed with ICs. To this end, we designed a new set of images that have equal pixel overlap with IC1 and IC2 images; referred to as ‘XRE images' (Extended Data Fig. 7b). The XRE1 and XRE2 images each have a real bar in the foreground, at the same position and orientation as the illusory bar in the IC1 and IC2 images, respectively. If neural responses are faithful to sensory inputs, we would expect both IC1 and IC2 to be equally likely to be decoded as XRE1 and XRE2. Alternatively, if the illusory bars in the IC images are represented in the neural activity pattern, the IC-evoked activity would be decoded as the XRE image with the real bar that matches the illusory bar. We trained the neural decoders to discriminate between neural activity patterns evoked by XRE1 vs. XRE2 images and used those decoders to classify IC1-evoked and IC2-evoked neural activity patterns. Then we computed the XRE inference score as the average of the probability that IC1 was decoded as XRE1, and IC2 as XRE2, and tested whether the XRE inference score was substantially different from chance of 0.5. When applying XRE inference decoding to different visual areas, we found consistent results as TRE inference decoding—IC inference was most strongly represented in L2/3 of V1 and LM (Extended Data Fig. 7b).

As a further test of the robustness of inference decoding, we applied this analysis to black-and-white inverted images. We found that inference decoding indicated the representation of IC inference in V1L2/3 regardless of black–white inversion (Extended Data Fig. 5e). In addition, different types of decoders yielded highly consistent results (Supplementary Fig. 3). These results indicate that inference decoding is a robust indicator of IC inference.

Together, our data support a model in which the neocortical representation of IC inference arises through corticocortical feedforward and feedback pathways between V1 and higher visual areas, especially LM. Furthermore, IC inference is encoded in V1L2/3 and not V1L4, indicating that V1L2/3 is the lowest region in the visual hierarchy where IC inference signals emerge. Notably, none of the higher visual areas showed a substantially larger inference performance compared to V1 (Extended Data Fig. 7a,c). This suggests that V1L2/3 may have an active role in shaping IC inference, rather than passively reflecting the inference signals computed in higher visual areas. Thus, we sought to elucidate the role of V1L2/3 in IC encoding.

So far, our data have established mechanisms of IC encoding at two levels. At the univariate level, we identified IC-encoders as neurons that respond to the whole illusory bar, but not its individual segments (Fig. 2). At the multivariate level, we found the representation of IC inference in the neural activity patterns (Fig. 3). To connect these two levels, we sought to assess the contribution of IC-encoders to the multivariate representation of IC inference. We focused on V1L2/3 because it is the lowest region in the visual hierarchy where IC inference is represented. We used the 2p imaging data for this analysis since it afforded the necessary dense sampling of V1L2/3. Moreover, we wanted to eventually test the causal role of functionally identified neural ensembles, and 2p imaging is readily compatible with 2p holographic optogenetics experiments.

To test whether IC-encoders are essential for the multivariate representation of IC inference, we analyzed the change in decoder performance when zeroing out their activity in the input to the decoder (Fig. 4a; V1L2/3 field of view, 24 sessions from four mice; mean ± s.e.m. = 1,968 ± 131 neurons per session). Indeed, this abolished the IC inference performance; TRE-responses were no longer biased toward being classified as IC compared to LC (Fig. 4a, right). IC-encoders are defined only by their selective visual responses to IC compared to LC, independent of any analysis of decoder weights. Thus, zeroing them out in the decoder can be meaningfully interpreted as being essential for decoding.

a, Decoder prediction performance when zeroing out the indicated subsets of neurons in the decoder input after training the decoder (mean ± s.e.m. across n = 24 sessions from four mice; left—cross-validation accuracy Friedman test across subsets P = 1.1 × 10−5, *P < 0.05 Wilcoxon signed-rank test compared to chance performance of 0.25 with P = 1.8 × 10−5, 1.8 × 10−5, 1.8 × 10−5 for each subset; right—TRE inference performance Friedman test across subsets P = 0.0019, *P < 0.05 Wilcoxon signed-rank test comparing fraction of IC vs. LC trials decoded as the corresponding TRE with P = 0.0177, 0.1228, 0.0089 for each subset). b, Decoder performance when decoding only from the indicated subsets of neurons (same subsets as a; cross-validation accuracy Friedman test P = 0.0025 and Wilcoxon signed-rank test P = 1.8 × 10−5, 1.8 × 10−5, 5.6 × 10−5; TRE inference score Friedman test P = 0.0208 and Wilcoxon signed-rank test P = 0.0177, 0.0004, 0.2472; mean ± s.e.m. across n = 24 sessions from four mice, *P < 0.05 Wilcoxon signed-rank test).

Next, we took the converse approach and trained a new decoder only on IC-encoders (Fig. 4b; mean ± s.e.m. = 30 ± 4 IC-encoders across sessions). Despite training this decoder on the activity of drastically fewer cells, it showed high levels of IC inference performance (Fig. 4b, right). These results demonstrate that the neural representation of IC inference is almost entirely mediated by the activity of IC-encoders.

IC encoding is first initiated by bottom-up sensory drive from the inducing segments of the IC16,17. Thus, neurons that respond to the inducing segments, that is, segment responders, likely have an important role in feedforward sensory processing. As expected, segment responders contained sufficient visual information to discriminate between IC and LC images on their own (Fig. 4b, left). However, in contrast to IC-encoders, zeroing out segment responders' activity in the original decoder did not interfere with IC inference performance (Fig. 4a, right), and training a new decoder only on these neurons did not yield a substantial IC inference performance (Fig. 4b, right; mean ± s.e.m. = 69 ± 8 segment responders across sessions). These results suggest that segment responders faithfully encode sensory information contained in the image, rather than global emergent features of the image. Furthermore, these results implicate a functional dichotomy between segment responders and IC-encoders, where the former receive bottom-up sensory signals and the latter receive top-down inference signals (Supplementary Fig. 4).

Taken together, we found that IC-encoders are disproportionately important for the neural representation of IC inference in V1L2/3. Furthermore, these results imply a segregation of inputs; segment responders receive bottom-up sensory signals and IC-encoders receive top-down inference signals. Next, we investigated the output connectivity of these V1L2/3 ensembles using 2p holographic optogenetics.

Prior studies have shown that IC encoding in V1 arises through top-down feedback7,15,16,17. However, prior work does not explain why IC encoding should exist in V1 in the first place, nor whether it might actively contribute to IC encoding. To address these questions, we used 2p holographic optogenetics to examine the direct causal role of distinct V1L2/3 ensembles in shaping IC encoding.

One possibility is that V1 IC-encoders broadcast sensory inference signals through neural pattern completion within V1L2/3. This could promote sensory inference by selectively strengthening IC representations. Another possibility is that the segment responders of the inducing segments directly drive IC-encoders, resulting in neural pattern completion. To test these ideas, we selectively photoactivated ensembles of IC-encoders and segment responders using 2p holographic optogenetics (n = 24 sessions from four mice; same dataset as Fig. 4). We developed an ‘all-optical read-write' experimental pipeline consisting of three stages (Fig. 5a). In stage 1 (the ‘read' stage), we recorded the visual responses of several thousand V1L2/3 neurons to the IC image set. In stage 2 (the ‘online analysis' stage), we analyzed the visual response properties of every neuron in the field-of-view to identify IC-encoders and segment responders. In stage 3 (the ‘write' stage), we holographically stimulated distinct functional ensembles in the absence of visual inputs, while simultaneously imaging the same field-of-view. Holographically driven activity of four holographic ensembles is shown in Fig. 5b; IC1-encoders, IC2-encoders, BR and TL segment responders (that is, segments in IC1), BL and TR segment responders (that is, segments in IC2). With this approach, we could test whether selectively photoactivating ensembles of IC-encoders or segment responders was sufficient to drive IC representation on their own. If so, this would imply that during normal visual activity, pattern completion circuits in V1 facilitate IC inference.

a, ‘All-optical read-write' experimental pipeline (24 sessions from four mice expressing GCaMP6m–ChRmine in V1 neurons). In stage 1 (‘read' stage), each image was presented 50–100 times in a randomized order. In stage 3 (‘write' stage), each holographic ensemble photoactivation was repeated 50 times in a randomized order. b, PSTHs of holographic evoked activity in directly photoactivated neurons. Four distinct neural ensembles were targeted—IC1-encoders, IC2-encoders, BR and TL segment responders and BL and TR segment responders. c, PSTHs of holographic evoked responses in nonphotoactivated neurons (>50 μm from all targets in each ensemble), for neurons that are visually responsive to the corresponding IC image vs. nonresponsive neurons (24 sessions from 4 mice; mean ± s.e.m. across neurons). Baseline activity, defined as activity −1 to 0 s relative to holography onset, was subtracted for each neuron. d,e, Decoders trained on visual evoked activity (0–1 s relative to visual onset) were used to classify holography-evoked activity (0–1 s relative to holography onset). Only the holographic ensembles with ≥10 targets were analyzed. Nonphotoactivated neurons denote neurons >50 μm from all targets in each holographic ensemble. Box-and-whisker plots are formatted as follows: centerline, median; box limits, upper and lower quartiles; whiskers, 1.5× interquartile range; points, outliers. d, Holography trials are expected to be decoded as IC1 when targeting IC1-encoders, and IC2 when targeting IC2-encoders. Holography trials were decoded as expected when decoding all imaged neurons (left; P = 7.9 × 10−7 one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test compared to chance across n = 32 IC-encoder ensembles). In addition, nonphotoactivated neurons were decoded as corresponding visual labels substantially above chance (right; P = 4.3 × 10−5; median performance = 0.3720, Q1–Q3 = 0.2870–0.5750). *P < 0.05. e, Holography trials are expected to be decoded as IC1 when targeting BR + TL segment responders, and IC2 when targeting BL + TR segment responders. Holography trials were decoded as expected when decoding all imaged neurons (left; P = 0.0029 one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test compared to chance across n = 37 segment responder ensembles). However, nonphotoactivated neurons were not decoded as the corresponding visual label (right; P = 0.3254; median performance = 0.2280, Q1–Q3 = 0.1680–0.3535).

We sought to assess the output of photoactivated ensembles within V1L2/3 by examining the nonphotoactivated neurons in the field-of-view, excluding any cell in the vicinity of holographic targets that could have been directly photoactivated by the holographic light (Extended Data Fig. 8a). We compared the activity of IC-responsive neurons to non-IC-responsive neurons. IC-responsive neurons respond to IC images, and they include both IC-encoders (which respond to IC but not LC images) and segment responders (which respond to both IC and LC images). If any of the holographic ensembles strengthened IC representations through neural pattern completion, we would expect them to synaptically drive neurons that are visually responsive to the IC image differentially from those that are not IC responsive. Consistent with prior reports, photoactivating a sparse ensemble of excitatory neurons in V1L2/3 led to a prolonged suppression of the nonphotoactivated population on average (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 8b,c)26. When targeting IC-encoders, this suppression was preceded by a selective activation of IC-responsive neurons during the photoactivation window (0–1 s relative to holography onset). Inspecting individual neurons revealed that the biphasic response can be decomposed into a relatively fast activation of a subset of neurons, and a slower suppression of a different subset of neurons (Extended Data Fig. 8c). This indicates substantial heterogeneity among the holographic evoked activity of nonphotoactivated neurons. Despite this heterogeneity, targeting IC-encoders evoked substantially larger activity in IC-responsive neurons compared to non-IC-responsive neurons during the photoactivation window (P = 0.0023 one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test across n = 32 holographic ensembles). On the contrary, targeting segment responders did not evoke differential activity in IC-responsive vs. non-IC-responsive neurons (P = 0.9660 across n = 37 holographic ensembles). Taken together, photoactivation of IC-encoders, but not segment responders, drove mean activity differences between IC-responsive and non-IC-responsive neurons among nonphotoactivated neurons (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 8b,c). These results suggest that IC-encoders, but not segment responders, might drive neural pattern completion.

Next, we used decoding to assess neural pattern completion more holistically. Pattern completion refers to the generation of the entire pattern given a partial pattern. Thus, we first sought to establish that the photoactivation constituted a distinctive partial pattern of the visual evoked activity. To this end, we trained the neural decoder to classify visually evoked neural activity patterns with all neurons in the field-of-view (IC1 vs. LC1 vs. LC2 vs. IC2, as in Fig. 3a). Then, we asked how this decoder, trained only on visual evoked activity, would classify the holographically evoked neural activity in the absence of any visual inputs. As expected, the decoder classified the coactivation of IC1-encoders as the IC1 image and the coactivation of IC2-encoders as the IC2 image. In addition, it classified the coactivation BR + TL segment responders (that is, the inducing segments in IC1) as the IC1 stimulus, and the coactivation of BL + TR segment responders (that is, the inducing segments in IC2) as the IC2 stimulus. These results demonstrate that the holographic optogenetic activation of these ensembles successfully emulated partial patterns of visual stimulus-specific neural activity (Fig. 5d,e, left; mean ± s.e.m. = 18 ± 2 IC-encoders and 22 ± 3 segment responders were targeted; analysis was restricted to holographic ensembles with n ≥ 10 targets).

Equipped with this approach, we asked if selective photoactivation of these ensembles could drive pattern completion within the local V1L2/3 network. If IC-encoders have a privileged role in amplifying sensory inferences within V1, they may drive decodable representations of IC in the nonphotoactivated population. Indeed, the decoder constructed with nonphotoactivated neurons was able to classify IC-encoder photoactivation trials as the corresponding IC image (Fig. 5d, right, and Extended Data Fig. 9a,b,e,f). In fact, decoding holographically driven activity with a decoder trained on visual trials showed a performance that approached the cross-validation accuracy of held-out visual trials for the same decoder (mean ± s.e.m. performance for decoding holography trials as visual image labels was 0.4029 ± 0.0296, whereas cross-validation accuracy was 0.4818 ± 0.0165; Extended Data Fig. 9b). This implies that holographic-driven activity was able to emulate visual-driven activity with remarkable accuracy.

In contrast, photoactivating a similar number of segment responders did not evoke decodable activity patterns (Fig. 5e, right, and Extended Data Fig. 9c,d,g,h). These effects were consistent regardless of whether the decoder was constructed from nonphotoactivated neurons for each holographic ensemble (Fig. 5d,e, right, and Extended Data Fig. 9a–d), or from a common pool of nonphotoactivated neurons (Extended Data Fig. 9e–h). Thus, photoactivating IC-encoders, but not segment responders, was sufficient to drive V1 activity patterns resembling those visually evoked by the corresponding IC image even in the absence of any visual stimulus. The pattern completion effects of IC-encoders correlated with the number of targets in the holographic ensemble (Extended Data Fig. 9b). Of note, in these experiments, we photoactivated nearly every IC-encoder within the imaged population. Thus, the decoder classified the induced network activity pattern only from the non-IC-encoders.

As a further test of the distinct capacity of IC-encoders to drive pattern completion, we photoactivated ‘LC-encoders', which we defined as neurons that selectively respond to one of the LC images but not to any of the IC images (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b). LC-encoders were substantially less potent at driving pattern completion of LC representations compared to IC-encoders, despite being matched in targeted numbers, visual selectivity and contribution to decoding performance (Extended Data Fig. 10c–e). Moreover, the optogenetically driven recurrent activity of nonphotoactivated neurons was substantially more likely to be decoded as the corresponding IC/LC image when photoactivating IC-encoders compared to LC-encoders and segment responders, even when the amount of visual information contained in the holographic ensembles were matched (Extended Data Fig. 10f,g). Together, these results indicate that IC-encoders are distinctively potent at driving pattern completion of IC representations within V1L2/3.

The 2p holographic optogenetics experiments described above suggest a key new component to the conventional model of IC encoding (Fig. 6a). Consistent with the conventional model, our conceptual model proposes that segment responders receive bottom-up sensory signals and IC-encoders receive top-down inference signals16,17. Our data suggest a critical addition to this conceptual model—IC-encoders locally broadcast the top-down inference signal within the V1L2/3 network. Taken together, this leads to the prediction that segment responders have a primary role in feedforward propagation, while IC-encoders have a primary role in local reinforcement of inferential signals (Fig. 6a). If this is true, photoactivating segment responders should promote IC representations in higher visual areas, while IC-encoders should not. To test this hypothesis, we needed the technical ability to read out not just the local effects of holographic stimulation, but also the downstream effects. To this end, we used a new platform that we recently developed, a 2p holographic mesoscope18. This platform allowed us to holographically stimulate V1 neurons while observing network effects in several downstream higher visual areas simultaneously (Fig. 6b,c).

a, IC circuit schematic. V1 segment responders relay feedforward information to higher visual areas; V1 IC-encoders receive feedback from higher visual areas and locally broadcast the top-down information to the rest of the V1L2/3 network. b, Left, mesoscope field-of-view (2.4 × 2.4 mm2; Vglut1-CreXAi203 mouse; 11 sessions across two mice). Right, ‘influence map' of holography-evoked responses in an example 2p holographic mesoscope experiment (targets are marked with green ‘x').

For each holographically targeted ensemble, only the sessions with ≥10 targets were analyzed. Nonphotoactivated neurons denote neurons >25 μm from all targets in each holographic ensemble. Box-and-whisker plots are formatted as follows: centerline, median; box limits, upper and lower quartiles; whiskers, 1.5× interquartile range; points, outliers. d, V1 IC-encoder ensembles were targeted for photoactivation. Left, when decoding all neurons in the field-of-view, holography-evoked activity patterns were decoded as the corresponding visual images (n = 11 IC-encoder ensembles; mean ± s.e.m. = 16 ± 1 targets, P = 0.0010 one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test compared to chance). When decoding nonphotoactivated neurons in higher visual areas (all neurons in the field-of-view outside of V1), holography-evoked activity patterns were not decoded as corresponding visual images (P = 0.3501; median performance = 0.2750, Q1–Q3 = 0.2169–0.2893). e, Same as in d, when targeting V1 segment responder ensembles for photoactivation (n = 22 segment responder ensembles, mean ± s.e.m. = 21 ± 1 targets; left decode all neurons, P = 0.0047, right decode nonphotoactivated neurons in higher visual areas, P = 0.0457; median performance = 0.2780, Q1–Q3 = 0.2340–0.3060). *P < 0.05.

First, as above, decoding from all neurons in the mesoscopic field-of-view confirmed that photoactivation of V1 IC-encoder and segment responder ensembles evoked activity patterns that partially emulated those evoked by the corresponding images (analysis was restricted to holographic ensembles with n ≥ 10 targets; Fig. 6d, left; n = 11 IC-encoder ensembles with mean ± s.e.m. = 16 ± 1 targets; Fig. 6e, left, n = 22 segment responder ensembles with 21 ± 1 targets). Next, we decoded only from nonphotoactivated neurons in higher visual areas to test whether photoactivating IC-encoders or segment responders recreated IC representations in downstream regions. In stark contrast to pattern completion effects within V1L2/3 (Fig. 5d,e, right), V1 segment responders, but not V1 IC-encoders, drove IC representation in higher visual areas (Fig. 6d,e, right, and Supplementary Fig. 6). These data demonstrate that V1 segment responders drive feedforward communication of the bottom-up sensory information to higher visual areas, while V1 IC-encoders drive pattern completion within V1L2/3 that can reinforce this process. Taken together, our data establish recurrent looped connectivity among V1 IC-encoders, V1 segment responders and higher visual areas.

We combined large-scale electrophysiology, 2p imaging, 2p holographic optogenetics and 2p holographic mesoscope to establish a direct, causal link between neural pattern completion in the primary V1 and sensory inference. We identified a subpopulation of visual cortical neurons that specifically encode ICs as emergent features of the image. Next, by leveraging the large numbers of simultaneously recorded neurons, we developed a multivariate approach to identify patterns of neural activity that encode sensory inferences. Using this new ‘inference decoding' paradigm, we found strong representations of IC inference in L2/3 of V1 and LM. In contrast, thalamo-recipient L4 in V1 did not represent IC inference. Therefore, V1L2/3 is the lowest area in the visual hierarchy to be involved in IC inference computation. Further analysis of inference decoding in V1L2/3 revealed that IC-encoders mediate the representation of the inferred illusory contour. Strikingly, we found that 2p holographic stimulation of IC-encoders drove neural pattern completion within V1L2/3, in the absence of visual inputs. While segment responders did not induce IC representation within V1L2/3, further examination of the visual cortical hierarchy using the 2p holographic mesoscope revealed that segment responders drove IC representations in higher visual areas.

Prior literature emphasized the role of top-down feedback in generating IC inference signals in V1 (refs. 7,14,15). Although this top-down feedback explains why IC responses emerge in V1, it does not elucidate their potential role, if any. Our findings fill in this gap by highlighting pattern completion within V1 as a critical missing step in existing models of IC encoding16,17. This pattern completion in V1 may help to ensure that only visual signals that match prior expectations are selectively reinforced during recurrent activity between V1 and higher visual areas.

Our experimental demonstration of recurrent looped connectivity in the visual hierarchy confirms a critical prediction from computational studies of IC inference. Previous studies have found that conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with purely feedforward architectures fail to ‘perceive' ICs, but adding in recurrent looped connectivity leads to the emergence of IC inference27,28,29. Thus, our results provide definitive biological evidence for a key prediction from artificial neural network (ANN) studies—recurrent looped connectivity in the visual hierarchy is essential for IC inference.

Several studies have shown that cortical stimulation of a small number of neurons could trigger highly structured patterns of neural activity, or even goal-directed behavior, in the absence of any sensory inputs30,31,32,33. Such structured patterns can even emerge during spontaneous activity34,35. These studies revealed that cortical circuits are primed for pattern completion, likely due to structured connectivity. A prominent example of such structured connectivity is the like-to-like connectivity, that is, enhanced connectivity between neurons encoding coherent sensory information36,37,38,39,40. However, no prior work has studied neocortical pattern completion, nor its underlying connectivity, in the context of sensory inference. Our study suggests a vital function for neocortical pattern completion in sensory inference.

We propose that the recurrent pattern completion underlying IC encoding is ubiquitous in active perceptual processing of the external world. Sensory systems are constantly faced with incomplete or ambiguous sensory information. In these situations, successful perception depends on sensory inference. For example, humans are capable of fast and accurate object recognition even when objects are occluded41. Similar to ICs, top-down predictions about occluded objects are thought to be implemented by feedback connections from higher sensory areas21,23,42. Reinforcement of top-down predictions in lower sensory areas through recurrent pattern completion likely also has a critical role in visual object recognition during occlusion41. More generally, feedback-driven pattern completion in lower cortical areas may be a universal mechanism of sensory inference. This pattern completion may generate recurrent activity spanning lower and higher sensory cortices, iteratively refining inference computation by selectively reinforcing neural activity patterns that match prior expectations. Taken together, holistic percepts can emerge despite sensory ambiguity through recurrent pattern completion in the neocortical sensory hierarchy.

All experiments were performed in C57/B6 mice of both sexes, aged 6 weeks and older. Imaging experiments in Figs. 1–3 were conducted with CaMKII-tTA;tetO-GcaMP6s mice (V1L2/3 and mesoscope L2/3 data), and Scnn1a-Tg3-Cre;Ai162(TIT2L-GC6s-ICL-tTA2)-D mice (V1L4 data). Neuropixels experiments were conducted with Sst-IRES-Cre;Ai32(RCL-ChR2(H134R)_EYFP) mice (n = 10) and PV-IRES-Cre;Ai32(RCL-ChR2(H134R)_EYFP) mice (n = 4). The 2p holographic optogenetics experiments in Figs. 4 and 5 were conducted with AAV8-hSyn-GCaMP6m-p2A-ChRmine-Kv2.1-WPRE injected in PV-IRES-Cre;RCL-tdTomato mice (n = 2) and AAV9-2YF-hSyn-DIO-GcaMP6m-P2A-ChRmine-Kv2.1-WPRE in Emx1-Cre mice (n = 2). Furthermore, 2p holographic mesoscope experiments in Fig. 6 were conducted with Vglut1-Cre;Ai203 mice (Ai203 refers to a transgenic line expressing the transgene TITL-st-ChroME-GCaMP7s-ICL-nls-mRuby3-IRES2-tTA2; n = 2). All experiments on animals were conducted with approval of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, Berkeley (imaging and 2p holographic optogenetics experiments) and the Allen Institute's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Neuropixels experiments).

Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (2%) and mounted on a stereotaxic apparatus. Buprenorphine (0.05 mg kg−1, analgesic) and dexamethasone (2 mg kg−1, anti-inflammatory) were injected subcutaneously. Body temperature was maintained at 36.5 °C. After hair removal and disinfection with 70% ethanol and 5% iodine, the scalp was removed and the fascia was retracted. A circular craniotomy of 3–5 mm was made on the left hemisphere using a biopsy punch (Robbins Instruments) and/or a dental drill (Foredom) with a 0.5 mm drill bit (FST Item 19007-05). Glass coverslips of 3–5 mm diameter were placed on top of the craniotomy and sealed with dental cement (C&B Metabond). These glass coverslips, or ‘windows', were made beforehand by gluing two layers of round cover glass (for example, 1 × 3 mm + 1 × 5 mm, Warner Instruments, 1 thickness) with Norland Optical Adhesive 71 (UV-cured). Finally, a titanium headplate was fixed to the skull with dental cement (C&B Metabond). The dental cement was coated in a layer of black oxide to mitigate light leakage during 2p imaging.

For 2p holographic optogenetics experiments, we injected the GCaMP6m-p2A-ChRmine-Kv2.1 virus during the window implant surgery (500 nl per two depths and two sites). Injection speed was 100–250 nl min−1, and after injection in each site, pipette was held in place for 5 min. Injection sites were centered at 2.7 mm lateral, 0.2 mm anterior relative to lambda and injection depths were 120 µm and 250 µm.

The Neuropixels data were acquired at the Allen Institute as part of the OpenScope project that allows the community to apply for observation on the Allen Brain Observatory platform (https://alleninstitute.org/division/mindscope/openscope/). The Neuropixels pipeline at the Allen Institute is described in detail in ref. 43 and Durand et al.44, as well as the online white paper45. Briefly, the mouse underwent headplate implantation and craniotomy surgery, in a procedure similar to the one described above. The 5-mm craniotomy was sealed with a glass coverslip, the bottom of which was coated with silicone to reduce adhesion to the brain surface. The glass coverslip was held in place with Vetbond and Kwik-Cast (World Precision Instruments) until the day of the recording (several weeks later). Intrinsic signal imaging was performed to identify visual area boundaries46. Based on the identified visual areas, an insertion window was designed for each mouse. Mice were habituated to head fixation and visual stimulation over a period of 2 weeks.

On the day of recording, the cranial coverslip was removed and replaced with the insertion window containing holes aligned to six cortical visual areas. Mice were allowed to recover for 1–2 h after insertion window placement, before being head-fixed in the recording rig.

Six Neuropixels probes were targeted to each of the six visual cortical areas (V1, LM, RL, AL, PM and AM). Probes were doused with CM-DiI (1 mM in ethanol; Thermo Fisher Scientific, V22888) for post hoc ex vivo probe localization. Each probe was mounted on a 3-axis micromanipulator (New Scale Technologies). The tip of each probe was aligned to its associated opening in the insertion window guided by an Indian Statistical Institute map of the visual system. The operator then moved each probe into place with a joystick, with the probes fully retracted along the insertion axis, approximately 2.5 mm above the brain surface. The probes were then manually lowered one by one to the brain surface until spikes were visible on the electrodes closest to the tip. After the probes penetrated the brain to a depth of around 100 μm, they were inserted automatically at a rate of 200 μm min−1 (total of 3.5 mm or less in the brain). After the probes reached their targets, they were allowed to settle for 5–10 min.

Neuropixels data were acquired at 30 kHz (spike band, 500-Hz high-pass filter) and 2.5 kHz (LFP band, 1,000-Hz low-pass filter) using the Open Ephys GUI43. Videos of the eye and body were acquired at 30 Hz. The angular velocity of the running wheel was recorded at the time of each stimulus frame, at approximately 60 Hz.

The spike-band data are median-subtracted, first within-channel to center the signal around zero, then across channels to remove common-mode noise. The median-subtracted data file is sent to the Kilosort2 MATLAB package (https://github.com/mouseland/Kilosort2)47, which applies a 150-Hz high-pass filter, followed by whitening in blocks of 32 channels. Kilosort2 models this filtered, whitened data as a sum of spike ‘templates'. The shape and locations of each template are iteratively refined until the data can be accurately reconstructed from a set of N templates at M spike times. Finally, Kilosort2 output is curated to remove putative double-counted spikes and units with artefactual waveforms. All units not classified as noise were packaged into Neurodata Without Borders files and analyzed in this paper.

As our focus was on excitatory neurons, we analyzed regular-spiking (RS) units in the Neuropixels dataset, defined as spike-sorted single units with extracellular spike trough-to-peak width of ≥0.4 ms. For brevity, we referred to RS units as ‘neurons'.

The 2p imaging experiments presented in Figs. 1–3 were conducted in two setups. V1L2/3 and V1L4 imaging was done on a 2p microscope (Neurolabware with Scanbox GUI) with a Ti:sapphire laser (Chameleon Ultra II, Coherent), an electrotunable lens for multiplane imaging (Optotune), 8 kHz galvo-resonant scanner and a Nixon ×16 magnification 12.5-mm focal length 0.8 NA water immersion objective. Typical image settings were as follows: field-of-view size 1,223 × 675 μm2 (796 × 512 pixels), four planes spaced 50 μm apart sampled at volumetric frame rate 7.715 Hz, imaging wavelength 930 nm.

Mesoscope 2p imaging was done on 2p random access mesoscope (Thorlabs with ScanImage GUI), equipped with a Ti:sapphire laser (Mai Tai, Spectra Physics), remote-focusing unit consisting of an objective and a mirror mounted on a voice coil, 12 kHz galvo-resonant scanner and Jenoptiks/Thorlabs water immersion objective with 21 mm focal length and 0.6 excitation NA and 1.0 collection NA. Typical image settings were as follows: field-of-view size 3,031 × 2,965 μm2 (3,040 × 1,484 pixels), frame rate 3.139 Hz, imaging wavelength 920 nm.

During post hoc analysis, motion correction and source extraction were done using Suite2p48. Suite2p output putative regions of interest (ROIs) that correspond to neuronal somas, and these ROIs were manually inspected to keep only those that looked like cell bodies. Neuropil signal was subtracted from each ROI with a coefficient of 0.7 (FC = FROI − 0.7 × Fneu). Z-F was calculated over each continuous block of recording as the z-scored FC, that is, ((FC − mean(FC))/std(FC)). ΔZ-F was calculated by subtracting baseline period activity (gray-screen period). For brevity, we referred to manually curated ROIs in the 2p data as ‘neurons'.

For 2p holographic optogenetics experiments presented in Fig. 5, three-dimensional (3D) scanless holographic optogenetics with temporal focusing (3D-SHOT) path was implemented in a Sutter MOM (Movable Objective Microscope, Sutter Instrument Co., with ScanImage GUI), as described previously26,49,50,51,52. Ti:sapphire laser (Chameleon Ultra II, Coherent) was used for 2p imaging, and femtosecond fiber laser (Satsuma HP2, 1030 nm, 2 MHz, 350 fs; Amplitude Systems) was used for 2p holographic stimulation. The holography path included a blazed diffraction grating for temporal focusing (600 l mm−1, 1,000 nm blaze; Edmund Optics, 49-570 or 33010FL01-520R; Newport), and a rotating diffuser to randomize the phase pattern and expand the beam. Both the imaging path and the holography path had spatial light modulators (SLM; HSP1920, 1,920 × 1,152 pixels; Meadowlark Optics). The imaging path SLM enabled optical axial focusing. The SLM was conjugated to the X resonant galvo and optical axial focusing was achieved by loading Fresnel-lens-like phase patterns on the SLM for each desired axial depth. The high refresh rate provided by the overdriven SLM allowed the acquisition speed to be limited only by the number of planes (no settling time or frame drop). The holography path SLM was used to display the holographic phase mask, calculated using the Gerchberg–Saxton algorithm to place several cell-sized diffraction-limited spots in 3D target positions50. A zero-order block was placed in the holography path. The imaging path and the holography path were merged by a polarizing beam splitter before the microscope tube lens and the objective (Olympus ×20 magnification, 9-mm focal length, 1.0 NA water immersion objective). To limit imaging artifacts introduced by the femtosecond laser, the femtosecond laser output was synchronized to the scan phase of the galvo-resonant scanner (8 kHz) using an Arduino Mega, gated to be only on the edges of every line scan.

Precise alignment of the imaging path and the holography path is achieved by a calibration procedure described previously26,49,50. Briefly, we place a thinly coated fluorescent slide on a substage camera to image both the imaging planes and the holograms at parametrically varied SLM coordinates. Then, the 3D coordinate transformation from imaging coordinates on each plane to SLM coordinates is computed through the ‘polyfitn' function in Matlab.

Before each experiment, the alignment is confirmed for each remote-focused plane by ‘burning holes' on a fluorescent slide (photobleaching). The intended imaging coordinates are displayed on ScanImage (Vidrio) as Integration ROIs. The match between the intended coordinates and the burnt hole positions confirms the validity of the current calibration.

As described in the ‘Results', the ‘all-optical read-write' 2p holographic optogenetic experiments were conducted in three stages. First was the ‘read' stage, where we image visual responses of neurons in the V1L2/3 field-of-view. Second was the online analysis stage, where we ran Suite2p on the imaging data collected in the first stage and identified functional groups of neurons (IC-encoders, segment responders). Third was the ‘write' stage, where we holographically stimulated these functionally identified neuron groups. Throughout all stages of the experiment, the mouse was head-fixed under the objective, and the imaging conditions were kept constant (same field-of-view of size 980 × 980 μm2, same set of four planes spaced 30 μm apart, with each plane being imaged every four frames at 7.525 Hz volumetric frame rate, imaging wavelength of 920 nm).

For fast online analysis, we converted ScanImage Tiff files into four h5 files, generating one h5 file per plane. Then, we ran Suite2p for each h5 file independently, in parallel (‘multiprocessing' package in Python). On an eight-core CPU (Intel Core i7 10700K 3.8 GHz) with 128 GB RAM, online Suite2p of a 25 min imaging data (512 × 512 pixels) took eight minutes. Then, all ROIs identified by the Suite2p were analyzed in Matlab to identify functional groups of neurons (IC-encoders and segment responders). Finally, Suite2p output ‘stat.med' was used as the coordinate of the ROIs of interest. These Suite2p coordinates were converted to SLM coordinates per the calibration described above.

Because IC-encoders are sparse, we targeted every neuron identified as IC-encoders during the online analysis step. For segment responders, we balanced the number of segment responders in the four groups (BR, BL, TL and TR). For example, if the BR-segment responders had the lowest number (N), we chose the top N most responsive segment responders from the other three groups. Responsiveness was quantified as the area under receiver operating curve in the ideal observer analysis discriminating between neural responses on inward vs. outward segment image trials. Mean number of targets in each holographic ensemble were as follows: 17 IC1-encoders, 18 IC2-encoders, 22 BR + TL segment responders 22 BL + TR segment responders.

After determining the holography groups with online analysis, holograms containing all targets in each group were calculated using the Gerchberg–Saxton algorithm50. The holograms were diffraction efficiency corrected to achieve homogeneous power delivery of 7 mW to all targeted cells. Holographic stimulation on each trial consisted of ten pulses at 10 Hz with 10 ms pulse width, and the ITI was 4.5 s. Stimulation of each holography group was repeated 50 times.

During post hoc offline analysis, Suite2p was run over the entire recording, including stage 1 (read stage, visual block) and stage 3 (write stage, holography block). On average, 1,968 ROIs were classified as putative neurons in the four-plane volumetric field-of-view. Targets were identified as the neuron closest to each target coordinate. Because online analysis does not entail manual curation of the ROIs, a target may not correspond to a neuron. Thus, a target was considered valid only if the closest neuron was within 10 µm, which left 81.5% of targets (mean number of valid targets for each holography group was 15 IC1-encoders, 16 IC2-encoders, 18 BR + TL segment responders and 17 BL + TR segment responders). Of these, holographic stimulation evoked substantial activation in 91.6% of valid targets (mean number of stimulated targets for each holography group was 14 IC1-encoders, 14 IC2-encoders, 16 BR + TL segment responders and 16 BL + TR segment responders). Nonphotoactivated neurons were defined as neurons >50μm from all holographic targets in each ensemble; distance threshold informed by the axial physiological point spread function in Extended Data Fig. 8a.

We developed the 2p holographic mesoscope by incorporating the 3D-SHOT into the Thorlabs 2p random access mesoscope. Full details are reported in a separate paper18. The holographic field-of-view was placed over V1 (gray-dotted rectangle in Fig. 6b, right). The imaging field-of-view encompassed V1, LM, RL, AL, PM and AM (2,400 × 2,400 m2). The imaging and holographic field-of-view was fixed throughout each recording session. The experimental pipeline was identical to the 2p holographic optogenetics experiments (Fig. 5a). During holographic ensemble stimulation, each target received 50 mW, and each stimulation consisted of ten pulses of 10 ms duration at 16 Hz. Zero-power ‘blank' trials were interleaved. Each trial type was repeated 100 times with an ITI of 5 s.

All Neuropixels recordings were made according to the standardized Neuropixels visual coding pipeline. Visual stimuli were generated using custom scripts based on PsychoPy62 and were displayed using an ASUS PA248Q LCD monitor, with 1,920 × 1,200 pixels (55.7-cm wide, 60-Hz refresh rate). Stimuli were presented monocularly, and the monitor was positioned 15 cm from the right eye of the mouse and spanned 120° × 95° of visual space. Monitor placement was standardized across rigs such that the mouse's right eye gaze would typically be directed at the center of the monitor.

For all 2p experiments, visual stimuli were generated using custom Matlab scripts based on Psychtoolbox-3 (ref. 53). In the standard 2p imaging setup, a 19-inch Samsung monitor was placed 15 cm from the mouse's right eye (1,280 × 1,024 pixels, 37.6 × 30.1 cm width and height, 60-Hz refresh rate). In the mesoscope 2p imaging setup and the 2p all-optical read-write setup, Adafruit Qualia 9.7″ DisplayPort Monitor was placed 8 cm from the right eye of the mouse (2,048 × 1,536 pixels, 19.7 × 14.8 cm width and height). The backlight of the Adafruit monitor was triggered by the galvo-resonant scanner such that the monitor would emit light only during the mirror turnaround time, similar to the gating of the holographic stimulation described above (12 kHz in the mesoscope 2p imaging setup, 8 kHz in the 2p all-optical read-write setup). In addition, in all 2p experiments, electrical tape was applied between the objective and the mouse's headplate to prevent monitor light from contaminating 2p imaging.

In all 2p experiments, retinotopic mapping was used to place the monitor such that the most common receptive field of the field-of-view would align with the center of the monitor. In the mesoscope 2p imaging, retinotopic mapping was additionally used to determine visual area boundaries using visual field sign maps54,55. After settling on the imaging field-of-view at the beginning of each 2p experiment, retinotopic mapping was conducted with 16° rectangular drifting grating patches appearing in one of 25 positions tiling an 80° × 80° visual degree grid. These patches had spatial frequency of 0.04 cycles per degree and a temporal frequency of 2 Hz, cycling through eight directions (0°/45°/90°/135°/180°/225°/270°/315°) over the course of 2 s, followed by a 1 s gray-screen intertrial interval (ITI). Each patch position was presented with three to five repeats, with randomized trial order.

After retinotopic mapping, visual stimulation consisted of three blocks—IC block, receptive field mapping block and size tuning block. Trial order was randomized within each block.

In the IC block, images described as IC, LC, IRE, TRE were shown (IC configuration 1; Extended Data Fig. 1b). In Neuropixels experiments and a subset of 2p imaging experiments, these images were also shown rotated 315° clockwise in a separate block (IC configuration 0; Extended Data Fig. 1b). The diameter of the white circles was 30 visual degrees, and the distance between the centers of the diagonally placed white circles were 46 visual degrees (that is, the gap between diagonal circles were 16 visual degrees). The black bar length on each inducer segment was 16 visual degrees, such that the IC support ratio in IC images would be 2/3. Edges delimiting the real bar in the real edge images (IRE/TRE/XRE) were at least 2° thick, which is well over the grating acuity threshold (0.55 cycles per degree) and, in fact, close to the maximum sensitivity of mouse vision (0.2 cycles per degree)19. Throughout each IC block, the four white circles stayed in place even during the ITI. In Neuropixels recordings, each image was presented for 0.4 s followed by 0.4 s ITI. In IC configuration 1, each image was repeated at least 50 times, and IC and LC images were repeated 400 times; in IC configuration 0, each image was repeated 30 times. Generally, in 2p experiments, each image was presented for 1 s followed by 0 s ITI. Each image was repeated at least 50 times, and IC and LC images were repeated 400–500 times. In 2p holographic optogenetics experiments, each image was presented for 1 s followed by 0 s ITI. Each image was repeated 50–100 times. In 2p recordings in Fig. 1, each image was presented for 1 s followed by a variable ITI of 1–2 s. Each image was repeated 10 times in 9 sessions and 50 times in 20 sessions.

In the receptive field mapping block, circular patches of drifting gratings with a fixed diameter of 16 visual degrees were presented in nine different locations, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 3a; one patch was positioned at the center of the monitor, the rest were positioned at 16 visual degrees distance from the center in 6/4.5/3/1.5/12/10.5/9/7.5 o'clock positions. Drifting gratings had a spatial frequency of 0.04 cycles per degree and a temporal frequency of 2 Hz. The drifting gratings had 100% contrast and were presented on a gray background. On each trial, a circular patch of drifting grating appeared in one of nine positions and cycled through several directions spaced 45° apart, drifting in each direction for 0.25 s (4/8 directions lasting 1/2 s in Neuropixels/2p experiments, respectively). Presentation at each location was repeated ten times, with 0 s ITI.

In the size tuning block, circular patches of drifting gratings were presented with a fixed position at the center of the monitor, in different sizes of 0/4/8/16/32/64 visual degrees. Spatial frequency, temporal frequency and contrast of drifting gratings were identical to the receptive field mapping block. On each trial, a circular patch of drifting grating at a given size appeared in one of eight directions (0°/45°/90°/135°/180°/225°/270°/315°). In Neuropixels experiments, the presentation lasted 0.25 s followed by 0.5 s ITI, and each combination of size and direction was repeated 10 times. In 2p imaging experiments, the presentation lasted 1 s followed by 0 s ITI, and each combination of size and direction was repeated 10 times. The size tuning block was skipped in 2p holographic optogenetics experiments.

For results presented in Extended Data Fig. 2, we limited the analysis to trials where the mouse was fixating (fixed-gaze trials). Video of the mouse eye during the neural recording session was analyzed using DeepLabCut56. Resting pupil position was determined as the mode of the pupil position. Fixed-gaze trials were defined as trials where pupil position was within eight visual degrees of the resting pupil position throughout the duration of the trial.

Exclusively center-responsive neurons were defined as neurons that exclusively responded to circular grating patches in the center position, corresponding to the illusory gap region, and not to any of the other adjacent positions (Fig. 1; Wilcoxon rank-sum test between trials with circular grating patches in each position and gray-screen trials, Bonferroni–Holm correction for multiple comparisons). In the Neuropixels data, there were n = 18 exclusively center-responsive neurons of 1,804 V1 RS units. In the 2p imaging data, there were n = 310 exclusively center-responsive neurons of 18,576 V1L2/3 neurons. The low proportion of neurons is expected from the strict criteria we imposed.

IC-encoders were defined as neurons that respond to one of the IC images, and to neither of the LC stimuli (Kruskal–Wallis test across responses to ‘blank' (four white circles) vs. IC1 vs. LC1 vs. LC2 vs. IC2 with Tukey–Kramer correction for multiple comparisons). Across ICwcfg0 and ICwcfg1, 159 of 1,804 V1 RS units were identified as IC-encoders in the Neuropixels dataset; 1,569 of 18,576 V1L2/3 excitatory neurons were identified as IC-encoders in the 2p dataset.

Segment responders were defined as neurons that selectively responded to inward-pointing inducer segments in each inducer position. For example, BR-segment responders are defined as neurons that respond substantially more to InBR than OutBR (Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Fig. 2a,b).

For all decoding analyses presented in the main figures (Figs. 3–6), we used a support vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel. First, we constructed the trial-by-trial response matrix (trials x neurons) as the response averaged over the visual stimulus presentation period (firing rate for Neuropixels data, z-F for 2p data). We divided the trials with the training trial types (IC1/LC1/LC2/IC2) into a training set (90%) and a testing set (10%). For tenfold cross-validation, there were ten splits of training/testing sets, and the ten sets of test trials were nonoverlapping. On each of the ten iterations, the trial-by-trial response matrix was z-scored based on the training set, that is, response matrix was subtracted by the mean of training trials and divided by the s.d. of training trials. On each iteration, SVM was trained using the ‘fitcecoc' function in MATLAB. Cross-validation accuracy was computed as the SVM's prediction accuracy on the testing set, averaged across ten iterations. The inference decoding performance and the holography-evoked activity decoding performance were also measured as the average prediction performance of the ten SVMs.

The holography-evoked response matrix, used as the input to the decoder in Fig. 5d,e, was calculated as the normalized z-F in the 1 s period following the onset of the holographic stimulation. Normalization entailed subtracting the mean and dividing by the s.d. across all holography trials. To analyze the effects of photoactivation in the rest of the network, we analyzed only the nonphotoactivated neurons that were at least 50 μm away from all holographic targets in each ensemble. As shown by the physiological point spread function (PPSF; Extended Data Fig. 8a), all direct influence of holographic light dissipates by 50 μm.

The holographic mesoscope data were analyzed similarly, but with two adjustments. First, we took the 1 s period following the offset of the holographic stimulation. As described above, the holographic stimulation was confined to the turnaround period of the resonant mirror. The 2p random access mesoscope patches together multiple imaging regions, and holographic artifacts appear on either side of each imaging region. The region affected by the holographic artifact is correspondingly larger. Thus, we did not analyze the holographic stimulation period. Second, nonphotoactivated neurons were defined as neurons >25 μm from targets in each holographic ensemble; distance threshold was informed by the lateral physiological point spread function in this case because the mesoscopic field-of-view was imaged at a single depth.

In Figs. 5 and 6, nonphotoactivated neurons are defined for each holographic ensemble. Hence, the decoders for nonphotoactivated neurons consist of different sets of neurons for each ensemble. To assess whether these differences in decoder population affected the results, we also tried decoding off of a common pool of nonphotoactivated neurons (Extended Data Fig. 9e–h). The results remain the same as when decoding different sets of nonphotoactivated neurons for each holographic ensemble (Extended Data Fig. 9a–d). As such, the differential effects of distinct holographic ensembles are not an artifact of decoding from slightly different subsets of neurons.

In Supplementary Fig. 3, we compared the decoding performance of several different kinds of decoders. SVMs were trained with different kernels—linear vs. quadratic polynomial vs. radial basis function. In addition, a fully connected artificial neural network (ANN) was trained using Pytorch, similar to the decoding described in ref. 57. The ANN had an input layer with number of nodes matching the number of neurons, two hidden layers each with 100 nodes, and one output layer with number of nodes matching the number of training trial types (that is, 4 nodes, each corresponding to IC1/LC1/LC2/IC2). Softmax function was applied to the output layer. The ANN was trained for 50,000 epochs with the Adam optimizer and the CrossEntropyLoss loss function. All decoders underwent tenfold cross-validation, as described in detail above.

The cross-correlogram is defined as:

where x1 and x2 are spike trains of two units across the IC configuration 1 block (72 min, 1-ms bins), L is the length of the spike trains, λ1 and λ2 are the net spike count across each spike train and τ is the time lag between the spike trains.

To account for cofluctuations in rate, smoothed cross-correlogram was calculated from spike trains smoothed with a 25-ms window. Then, we calculated the corrected cross-correlogram by subtracting the smoothed cross-correlogram from the original cross-correlogram.

To determine whether there was a putative excitatory connection between a pair of units, peaks in corrected cross-correlogram were found in 1–10-ms window. The connection was deemed substantial if the peak value exceeded the threshold, where the threshold was calculated as sevenfold of the cross-correlogram flank s.d. (between ±50 and 100 ms from zero).

Nonparametric two-sided tests are used unless otherwise noted. Adjustments for multiple comparisons have been noted wherever they were applied. When applicable, we used cross-validation to avoid overfitting.

No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size, but we used an equivalent or larger sample size than similar studies18,26,58,59. Trial order within each block was randomized. All data exclusions are described along with exclusion criteria and the rationale for exclusion. Analysis of Neuropixels data was performed blind to collection and spike sorting. Manual curation of 2p imaging data (Suite2p) was performed blind to visual and holography-evoked responses.

a, Schematic of visual stimulus sequences during the experiment. Throughout each IC visual block, the four circles were present in all stimulus frames. b, Images in the IC block were presented in four distinct types of blocks. The default block, ICwcfg1, has four white circles in each quadrant on black background. In the ICwcfg0 block, images are rotated 315° clockwise relative to ICwcfg1. ICkcfg1 and ICkcfg0 are black–white inverted from ICwcfg1 and ICwcfg0, respectively. c, Images shown in a ICwcfg1 block.

a, Top, pupil position on an example session. Bottom, contours demarcate, for each session, the isolines for the value of 0.01 in the two-dimensional probability distribution function (PDF). IC1 vs. LC1 vs. LC2 vs. IC2 images are shown in the background for relative scale. Mouse eye gaze is confined to a small region that fits within the illusory gap region. There are no systematic differences in pupil position among IC1 vs. LC1 vs. LC2 vs. IC2 presentations. b, Fixed-gaze trials were defined as trials where the pupil position stayed within 8 visual degrees of the mode pupil position throughout the duration of the trial. When analyzing only fixed-gaze trials, there were n = 11 exclusively center-responsive V1 RS units; 10 sessions had eye tracking data and of these, 9 sessions had a valid receptive field mapping block where the fixed-gaze constraint left at least one trial in each position. c, PSTH of exclusively center-responsive V1 RS units on IC and IRE trials, for preferred IRE orientation and corresponding IC and segment image trials (mean ± s.e.m. across n = 11 neurons). These neurons respond to IRE images and less strongly to IC images, but not to the individual segments on either side of the illusory contour. d, PSTH on IC and IRE trials for preferred IRE orientation and corresponding IC trials (top: mean ± s.e.m. across neurons, bottom: individual neurons with significantly IC-responsive (left) and IRE-responsive (right) neurons marked in magenta on the y axis). e, Top, comparison of the preferred orientation between ICs (IC stimuli) and real edges (IRE stimuli) for exclusively center-responsive V1 RS units. Bottom, CDF for the null distribution, acquired by shuffling the preferred IC vs. IRE orientations among exclusively center-responsive V1 RS units. Actual match proportion is indicated with a red dotted line. f, Match between receptive field position mapped with fixed-gaze trials vs. all trials. Match proportion is 0.81 among 398 V1 RS units with significant receptive fields (p < 0.05 Kruskal–Wallis test across responses to 9 positions in the receptive field mapping block). g, Pupil area, z-scored across each recording session, during visual presentation of various images in the IC block (n = 10 sessions with eye tracking data; p = 0.7220 Friedman test). Box-and-whisker plots are formatted as follows: centerline, median; box limits, upper and lower quartiles; whiskers, 1.5× interquartile range; circles, outliers.

a, 2p imaging sessions with IC block images that had larger gaps between white circles; the gap size between diagonal white circles was 24 visual degree gaps (4 sessions from 2 mice). b, Receptive fields were mapped with 16 visual degree circular patches in 9 positions, spaced 16 visual degrees apart, same as Extended Data Fig. 5. There were n = 32 exclusively center-responsive V1 layer 2/3 excitatory neurons. c, PSTH on IC and IRE trials for preferred IRE orientation and corresponding IC trials (top: mean ± s.e.m. across neurons, bottom: individual neurons individual neurons with significantly IC-responsive (left) and IRE-responsive (right) neurons marked in magenta on the y axis). d, Top, comparison of the preferred orientation between ICs (IC stimuli) and real edges (IRE stimuli) for exclusively center-responsive V1 layer 2/3 excitatory neurons. Bottom, CDF for match proportions in shuffled distributions is shown as a black solid curve, actual match proportion in red dotted line. e, 2p imaging sessions with dense receptive field mapping and standard IC block images (30 visual degree white circles and 16 visual degree gaps; 5 sessions from 2 mice). f, Receptive fields were mapped with 16 visual degree circular patches in 17 positions, spaced 8 visual degrees apart (dense mapping, as in Extended Data Fig. 2). Of note, evoked response heatmaps are not drawn to proportion (heatmap circles have half the diameter of the actual circular patches used for mapping). Receptive field positions were determined for neurons with p < 0.05 Kruskal–Wallis test for responses across circular patch positions. There were n = 71 V1 layer 2/3 excitatory neurons with receptive fields in the center position. g,h, Same as c and d, but for V1 layer 2/3 excitatory neurons with receptive fields in the center position in dense mapping sessions. i, 2p imaging sessions with IC blocks that had gray background (50% contrast), with 30 visual degree white circles and 16 visual degree gaps (7 sessions from 3 mice). Top, these blocks contained contrast real edge images (CRE) in addition to outline real edge images (IRE). Bottom, PSTHs of exclusively center-responsive neurons show similar evoked responses to CRE and IRE, and smaller evoked responses to IC (mean ± s.e.m. across n = 38 exclusively center-responsive V1 layer 2/3 excitatory neurons). j, Receptive fields were mapped with 16 visual degree circular patches in 9 positions, spaced 16 visual degrees apart, same as b. k,l, Same as c and d, but for CRE trials instead of IRE trials in 50% contrast sessions. m,n, Same as c and d, but for 50% contrast sessions.

a, Receptive fields (RF) of all neurons were mapped using 16-degree patches of circular drifting gratings appearing in one of the nine positions depicted (top). Position 1 corresponds to the gap region in IC and LC images (bottom; for reference, the nine positions in the receptive field mapping block are shown on top of the default image from the IC block). Note, 16 degrees is slightly larger than the typical size of receptive fields in mouse V1. b, Example IC1-encoder (top) and IC2-encoder (bottom), showing its receptive field (left), PSTHs to IC and LC images (center), and PSTHs to inward segment images (right). PSTHs are calculated in 1 ms bins and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel that has an s.d. of 5 ms and is 25-ms long. c, Receptive fields percentage in each position for IC-encoders (left, two panels) and segment responders (right, four panels). IC-encoders' receptive fields are not biased toward the illusory gap region (n = 367/386 IC1/IC2-encoders in 24 sessions from 4 mice). On the contrary, segment responders' receptive fields are biased toward the image segments that are used to define them (n = 552/482/409/410 BR/BL/TL/TR segment responders in 24 sessions from 4 mice). d, Positions of circular patches used for dense receptive field mapping shown in cyan and yellow lines, relative to the IC block ‘blank' image (19 sessions from 5 mice). e, IC-encoders' receptive fields percentage in each position (n = 458/578 IC1/IC2-encoders). First and third panels show circular patches and their relative positions in actual proportions; second and fourth panels show the same data with smaller circular patches for clarity. f, IC block images were scaled up by 1.5× (10 sessions from 5 mice). Receptive fields were mapped with 16 visual degree square patches positioned in a 5 × 5 grid. g, IC-encoders' receptive fields percentage in each position (n = 129/126 IC1/IC2-encoders). Second and fourth panels show the receptive field distribution in red, and 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals of IC-responsive/LC-responsive neurons in black. h–i, Decoder performance for images scaled up by 1.5× (n = 10 sessions from 5 mice). *p < 0.05 Wilcoxon signed-rank test compared to chance of 0.25 for cross-validation accuracy in h (p = 0.0020) and 0 for TRE inference score in i (p = 0.0020). Box-and-whisker plots are formatted as follows: centerline, median; box limits, upper and lower quartiles; whiskers, 1.5x interquartile range; circles, outliers.

a, Illusory bars are perceived as dark bars on white-circles blocks (n = 11 sessions from 5 mice) and light bars on black-circles blocks (n = 9 sessions from 6 mice). b, IC-encoders' orientation tuning was measured using single lines that span the entire screen; dark bars were used for IC-encoders identified in white-circles blocks and light bars for black-circles blocks. For both white-circles blocks and black-circles blocks, IC-encoders are tuned to the orientation of the illusory bar that they are selective for (mean ± s.e.m. across neurons; white-circles block n = 93 IC1-encoders and n = 159 IC2-encoders, black-circles block n = 409 IC1-encoders and n = 482 IC2-encoders; Wilcoxon signed-rank test for orientation of the illusory bar vs. orthogonal orientation p = 0.0017 in the white-circles block, p = 2.6 × 10−8 in the black-circles block). c, Size tuning was measured using circular patches of drifting gratings in various sizes, positioned at the center of the monitor. Size tuning for neurons with receptive fields in the center position is shown in black (mean ± s.e.m. across n = 1638 neurons with p < 0.05 Kruskal–Wallis test across responses to 9 positions, maximal activity in the center); size tuning for IC-encoders with receptive fields in the center is shown in green (n = 12 center-receptive field IC-encoders in the white-circles block, n = 48 in the black-circles block). Receptive field size measured in this way is not distinct for IC-encoders compared to other visually responsive neurons. d, Circular patches of drifting gratings with 16 visual degree diameters were shown in 17 different positions spaced 8 visual degrees apart, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 2d. Number of patches that IC-encoders respond to is not different from IC-responsive neurons (error bars indicate 95% bootstrapped confidence interval). e, When decoding across all neurons recorded in each V1 layer 2/3 imaging session, TRE-evoked neural activity patterns are more likely to be decoded as IC than LC on both white-circles blocks (Wilcoxon signed-rank test p = 0.0020 across n = 11 sessions) and black-circles blocks (Wilcoxon signed-rank test p = 0.0273 across n = 9 sessions). Error bars indicate mean ± s.e.m. across sessions, and gray lines indicate paired TRE inference decoding performance for each session.

a, IC/LC images used to define IC-encoders and segment responders in this figure. b, For the Neuropixels dataset, proportion of V1 IC-encoders (left, n = 87) and V1 segment responders (right, n = 636) in each layer. In c–f, same dataset as Fig. 3d,e (left: of 12 sessions in Neuropixels dataset, sessions with <50 RS units are excluded, which leaves n = 12, 8, 11, 10, 12 and 11 sessions for V1, LM, RL, AL, PM and AM, respectively; right: n = 8/11/19 sessions for V1L4 FOV, V1L2/3 FOV, and mesoscope FOV, respectively. For each visual area, sessions with <100 neurons in that area are excluded, which leaves n = 8, 11, 19, 8, 15, 2, 6 and 1 sessions for V1L4, V1L2/3, mesoscope V1, LM, RL, AL, PM and AM, respectively). In c,d, box-and-whisker plots are formatted as follows: centerline, median; box limits, upper and lower quartiles; whiskers, 1.5x interquartile range; circles, outliers. c, Proportion of IC-encoders, out of all neurons, in each area. d, Proportion of IC-encoders, out of visually responsive neurons, in each area. Visually responsive neurons are defined as neurons that respond to at least one of IC/LC images (p < 0.05 Kruskal–Wallis test across responses to blank vs. IC1 vs. LC1 vs. LC2 vs. IC2). In e,f, response on IC vs. LC trials, averaged across all neurons (e) or visually responsive neurons (f) for each session (mean ± s.e.m. across sessions, paired data for each session indicated with gray lines). IC images do not evoke greater responses than LC images (*p < 0.05 one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test for testing IC > LC; note that none of the visual areas showed significance). e, Response on IC vs. LC trials, averaged across all neurons. In Neuropixels dataset, one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test for testing IC > LC returned p = 0.9614, 0.9805, 0.7676, 0.7217, 0.9895 and 0.8398 for V1, LM, RL, AL, PM and AM, respectively. In 2p dataset, p = 0.7266, 0.9932, 0.8476, 0.8086, 0.9794, 0.5000, 0.2188 and 1.0000 for V1L4, V1L2/3, mesoscope V1, LM, RL, AL, PM and AM, respectively. f, Response on IC vs. LC trials, averaged across visually responsive neurons. In Neuropixels dataset, one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test for testing IC > LC returned p = 0.9788, 0.9805, 0.7114, 0.7842, 0.9866 and 0.6499 for V1, LM, RL, AL, PM and AM, respectively. In 2p dataset, p = 0.8750, 0.9878, 0.8902, 0.9023, 0.9990, 0.2500, 0.3438 and 1.0000 for V1L4, V1L2/3, mesoscope V1, LM, RL, AL, PMz and AM, respectively.

In a–c, box-and-whisker plots are formatted as follows: centerline, median; box limits, upper and lower quartiles; whiskers, 1.5x interquartile range; circles, outliers. a, Same data as Fig. 2, but showing statistical comparisons between areas (12 sessions from 12 mice; for each area in the Neuropixels dataset, sessions with <50 RS units are excluded, which leaves n = 12, 8, 11, 10, 12 and 11 sessions for V1, LM, RL, AL, PM and AM, respectively; Kruskal–Wallis test p = 0.0019 for cross-validation accuracy across areas, p = 0.0249 for TRE inference score). b, XRE inference decoding entails probing IC-evoked neural activity patterns with decoders trained to discriminate between XRE-evoked neural activity patterns. XRE inference score was defined as (P(IC1 → XRE1) + P(IC2 → XRE2))/2. As with TRE inference decoding (Fig. 2), layer 2/3 of V1 and LM consistently show high inference scores (*p < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test compared to chance of 0.5; left: of 12 sessions in Neuropixels dataset, sessions with <50 RS units are excluded, which leaves n = 12, 8, 11, 10, 12 and 11 sessions with p = 0.0005, 0.0078, 0.0049, 0.0020, 0.0005 and 0.0137 for V1, LM, RL, AL, PM and AM, respectively; right: n = 8/11/19 sessions for V1L4 FOV, V1L2/3 FOV, and mesoscope FOV, respectively. For each visual area, sessions with <100 neurons in that area are excluded, which leaves n = 8, 11, 19, 8, 15, 2, 6 and 1 sessions with p = 0.4609, 0.0020, 0.0007, 0.0078, 0.0054, 0.5000, 0.4375 and 1.0000 for V1L4, V1L2/3, mesoscope V1, LM, RL, AL, PM, and AM, respectively). c, Same data as b, but showing statistical comparisons between areas (Kruskal–Wallis test p = 0.0005 for cross-validation accuracy across areas, p = 0.0022 for XRE inference score).

a, Lateral (left) and axial (right) physiological point spread functions (PPSF) of the two-photon holographic photo-stimulation system, measured in GCaMP6m–ChRmine expressing neurons (mean ± s.e.m. across n = 294 neurons). b, Holography evoked responses in nonphotoactivated neurons (>50 μm from all targets in each ensemble), for neurons that are visually responsive to the corresponding IC image (x axis) vs. nonresponsive neurons (y axis) (24 sessions from 4 mice). Holography-evoked response was measured during the photoactivation window (0–1 s relative to holography onset), and baseline activity was subtracted (−1 to 0 s relative to holography onset). Left, targeting IC-encoders evoked significantly larger activity in IC-responsive neurons than nonresponsive neurons (p = 0.0023 one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test across n = 32 holographic ensembles). Right, targeting segment responders did not evoke a larger activity in IC-responsive neurons compared to nonresponsive neurons (p = 0.9660 across n = 37 holographic ensembles). c, PSTH of holography evoked responses. Baseline activity was subtracted as in b. Top, holography-driven PSTH averaged across all neurons in each group (mean ± s.e.m. across neurons; IC-responsive in red, nonresponsive in black). Bottom, holography-driven PSTH shown as a heatmap for each neuron in each group. d, Same as top panels in c (mean ± s.e.m. across neurons), but also showing targeted neurons in each holographic ensemble (cyan). Activity in directly photoactivated neurons is an order of magnitude higher than the activity in nonphotoactivated neurons. e, PSTH of visual evoked responses, for the same group of neurons shown in d (mean ± s.e.m. across neurons; directedly targeted neurons in cyan, nonphotoactivated IC-responsive neurons in red, nonphotoactivated non-IC-responsive neurons in black).

In a–d, decoders were constructed with nonphotoactivated neurons, separately for each holographic ensemble (>50 μm from all targets in each ensemble; 24 sessions from 4 mice expressing GCaMP6m–ChRmine in V1 neurons). a, Holography-evoked response patterns are classified into the image that evoked the most similar visual response patterns. The expected classification given the holographic ensemble is marked with ‘o'. Only the holographic ensembles with ≥10 targets were analyzed (n = 17 IC1-encoder ensembles, n = 15 IC2-encoder ensembles). b, The proportion of holography trials decoded as the expected visual label (y axis), as a function of the number of targets in each holographic ensemble (left); tenfold cross-validation accuracy of the decoder trained on visual responses (middle); and the proportion of holography trials decoded as the expected visual label when decoder was trained on all neurons (right) (ρ denotes the Spearman correlation across holographic ensembles; n = 24 IC1-encoder ensembles, n = 24 IC2-encoder ensembles). c, Same as a, but for segment responder ensembles (n = 19 BR + TL segment responder ensembles, n = 18 BL + TR segment responder ensembles). d, Same as b, but for segment responder ensembles (n = 24 BR + TL segment responder ensembles, n = 24 BL + TR segment responder ensembles). e–h, Decoders were trained on neurons that were commonly nonphotoactivated across four holographic ensembles; IC1-encoders, IC2-encoders, BR + TL segment responders and BL + TR segment responders (>50 μm from all targets across these four ensembles). Otherwise, same as a–d.

a, LC-encoders are defined as neurons that respond to either LC1 or LC2, but not to either IC1 or IC2 (p < 0.05 Kruskal–Wallis test across responses to blank vs. IC1 vs. LC1 vs. LC2 vs. IC2, post hoc Tukey–Kramer test). In b–g, LC-encoders were targeted in two distinct holographic ensembles; LC1-encoder photoactivation is expected to be decoded as LC1, and LC2-encoder photoactivation is expected to be decoded as LC2 (n = 24 sessions from 4 mice expressing GCaMP6m–ChRmine in V1 neurons). b, Visual responses of neurons in each holographic ensemble. Mean ± s.e.m. across n = 428 LC1-encoders, n = 292 LC2-encoders, n = 354 IC1-encoders, n = 372 IC2-encoders, n = 424 BR + TL segment responders, n = 409 BL + TR segment responders. In c–e, only the holographic ensembles with ≥10 targets were analyzed (n = 35, 32 and 37 ensembles for LC-encoders, IC-encoders and segment responders, respectively). Box-and-whisker plots are formatted as follows: centerline, median; box limits, upper and lower quartiles; whiskers, 1.5x interquartile range; circles, outliers. c, To compare visual information contained in holographic ensembles, we compared the tenfold cross-validation accuracy of visual responses for targeted neurons on corresponding visual trials; LC-encoder ensembles on LC trials (LC1/LC2-encoders on LC1/LC2 trials, respectively), IC-encoder ensembles on IC trials (IC1/IC2-encoders on IC1/IC2 trials, respectively) and segment responder ensembles on IC trials (BR + TL/BL + TR segment responders on IC1/IC2 trials, respectively; Kruskal–Wallis test p = 2.0 × 10−8, followed by Bonferroni–Holm corrected Wilcoxon rank-sum tests *p < 0.05). d, Decoders constructed with all neurons were trained on visual evoked activity patterns and used to classify holography evoked activity patterns. Only the holographic ensembles with ≥10 targets were analyzed (n = 35, 32 and 37 ensembles for LC-encoders, IC-encoders and segment responders, respectively; Kruskal-Wallis test p = 2.4 × 10−11, followed by Bonferroni–Holm corrected Wilcoxon rank-sum tests *p < 0.05). e, Decoders were constructed with nonphotoactivated neurons for each holographic ensemble (Kruskal–Wallis test p = 0.0012, followed by Bonferroni–Holm corrected Wilcoxon rank-sum tests *p < 0.05). f, Relationship between visual information contained in each holographic ensemble (x axis; shown in c), and the decoding of holographically driven activity in nonphotoactivated neurons (y axis; shown in e). Cross-validation accuracy of holographic ensembles (x axis) was divided into 6 equidistant bins between 0 and 1, and mean ± s.e.m. decoder performance (y axis) of each bin was plotted for three groups of holographic ensembles (orange: n = 35 LC-encoder ensembles, green: n = 32 IC-encoder ensembles, magenta: n = 37 segment responder ensembles). g, For the three groups of holographic ensembles, cross-validation accuracies of targets were matched by matching the number of samples in each x-axis bin shown in f. Specifically, in each of the three bins where all three groups had data, we chose the group with the highest number of samples, and bootstrapped data in the other two groups to match the sample number. As a result, the bootstrapped distributions were matched in cross-validation accuracies of targets (left; n = 48 ensembles in each group, Kruskal–Wallis test p = 0.5811). When comparing the decoding performance of holographically driven activity in nonphotoactivated neurons among these bootstrapped distributions, we again see the highest performance when targeting IC-encoders (right; n = 48 ensembles in each group, Kruskal–Wallis test p = 0.0022, followed by Bonferroni–Holm corrected Wilcoxon rank-sum tests *p < 0.05). Box-and-whisker plots are formatted as in c–e.

Aviation and road transport are among the sectors that currently depend on increasingly vulnerable GPS timekeeping. Credit: Kevin Carter/Getty

It might not be apparent, but almost everything people do in this digitally connected world, from sending a text or e-mail to doing an Internet search or paying for something online, depends on accurate, resilient timing. Most electronic communications rely on digital infrastructure that is synchronized to a common time reference, enabling information to flow at a known rate. Accurate timing is also crucial for synchronizing and stabilizing infrastructure such as electricity grids, for helping to ensure the integrity of financial transactions, for steering machinery for precision agriculture, and for managing transport, logistics and postal delivery systems, among a host of other essential functions.

Today, the necessary timing signals come overwhelmingly from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). These deliver signals from space, with only a radio receiver needed to receive and interpret them. Chief among them is the US-developed Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS is free to use, and the technology is mature: miniature GPS receivers are now embedded in every smartphone, at a cost of a few dollars per unit. This is an easy, low-cost way to reliably synchronize time, certainly compared with the old method of physically calibrating your clock to a reference clock at a national standards agency.

Best ever clocks: breakthrough paves way for ultra-precise ‘nuclear' timekeepers

But this success has bred complacency — and led to underappreciated risk. GNSS are far from fail-safe. In many parts of the world, organized-crime syndicates and military authorities are among those increasingly jamming GNSS signals (blocking them entirely) or spoofing them (transmitting false signals to provide misleading time and position coordinates). Disruptions to the signal due to extreme weather events are also on the rise. In some sectors, such as aviation, a multitude of systems would potentially be affected in the event of more-widespread outages. But there is low awareness of the risks — and protections are hugely variable between sectors.

The increasing vulnerability of time signals from space necessitates the development of alternative ways of accessing accurate, resilient and secure time. We (the authors) have been involved in varying capacities in technology and economic measures to deliver a nationwide, resilient terrestrial timing solution that is independent of GNSS in the United Kingdom. Here we set out three key steps that we think would help to facilitate the development of alternative time sources worldwide: increasing buy-in from business; linking up existing, heterogeneous local timing systems; and creating entirely new uses for time.

Constellations of GNSS satellites disseminate time from the national-standards laboratories that contribute to the formulation of the global time scale, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The GPS system was developed by the US Department of Defense during the cold war, initially for the exclusive use of the US military. Each GPS satellite carries multiple atomic clocks, which are ultimately synchronized with a representation of the UTC, known as UTC(USNO), generated by an ensemble of atomic clocks at the US Naval Observatory in Washington DC. The signals these satellites beam down to Earth enable users to determine the time to within an accuracy of 10–7 seconds, or 100 billionths of a second.

Recognition in the 1980s of the wider potential societal benefits of GNSS led the United States to make an intentionally degraded, ‘selectively available' version of the GPS signal accessible to everyone globally, free of charge. The full version was made public in 2000, since when its use has ballooned in a plethora of civilian applications. Other GNSS systems exist, such as GLONASS (operated by Russia), Galileo (the European Union) and BeiDou (China). But GPS remains dominant owing to widespread public confidence in a US-provided infrastructure and to the system's earlier availability for general use, which means a large number of older receivers are only GPS-compliant. Some 5.6 billion end-user GNSS receiver units were in use in 2023, a number predicted to increase to almost 9 billion units in 2033 (see ‘Sky-high demand'). The economic benefits of using GNSS have been estimated to be around US$300 billion annually for the United States, $81 billion across Europe and from $9 billion to about $18 billion for the United Kingdom (see ‘Productivity plus').

Source: EU Agency for the Space Programme (https://go.nature.com/42AQKJL)

The potential costs of disruption to GNSS are similarly considerable: across all sectors, a report for the UK government in 2023 estimated these costs, per day, to be almost $1.9 billion for the United Kingdom alone. But whereas the economic benefits of using GNSS often accrue to individual firms, the economic cost of disturbances to the GPS signal — for example, the failure of the electricity grid due to a GPS outage that might affect transport, financial and communication systems — tends to be borne by all of society.

More onus needs to be put on firms and utilities that provide services through GNSS to invest in timing resilience. Regulation to increase the liability of individual firms, and personal accountability of senior managers for ensuring resilience of time, is one way to make this happen. There is also a need to support the development of alternative assured ‘holdover time' capabilities: accurate, locally based clocks that can continue to provide time for a while if the main GNSS signals are lost.

Source: London Economics (https://go.nature.com/4G5NDYM)

The cumulative investment costs across every organization in every sector to provide such a holdover system are likely to be significant. Developing national public infrastructures for delivering resilient timekeeping directly from national representations of UTC — in effect, recreating timekeeping as a national public utility — is a way to reduce direct costs for businesses. Such a public utility could instil trust and confidence in users, and cover its costs by offering tiered, paid-for levels of assurance of time. In the United Kingdom, a supporting terrestrial clock system is being designed and developed as a nationwide time infrastructure through the National Timing Centre research and development programme (of which one of us, L.L., is head) at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) at Teddington. This system is linked to UTC(NPL), the United Kingdom's real-time realization of UTC.

But limited understanding of the need for alternative assured-time capabilities is a barrier to achieving business and political buy-in. A programme of public awareness about the use and importance of GNSS should be rolled out globally, emphasizing both the risks inherent in the current systems and the benefits of alternative timing systems for increased resilience and enhanced performance.

Crucial infrastructures, from financial services to transport and energy systems, are often interdependent. Yet they tend to operate as independent ecosystems, subject to their own legislation and with their own regulatory standards, policies, supply chains and digital ecosystems.

Little thought tends to be given to the security of timekeeping in the design and maintenance of the digital systems underpinning this infrastructure. Time's intangible nature means that it often falls in the gap between cybersecurity and physical-security measures designed to protect digital and physical assets, respectively. When mitigating GNSS loss or disruption is considered at all, it tends to be by individual firms on an ad hoc basis. For example, telecommunications network providers often have atomic clocks distributed across their fibre exchanges to enable synchronization to be maintained for the Internet backbone even if GNSS signals are disrupted. Such mitigation measures are rarely tested robustly for the possibility of GNSS outages across all interconnected sectors.

The increasingly interlinked nature of timing infrastructure implies that terrestrial clocks need to be integrated and able to coordinate time in the case of disruption to GNSS. This underlines the desirability of government intervention to provide a base capability that is accessible to all users wherever and whenever they need it. This might take the form of new legislation or regulation and standards to allow interoperability between essential infrastructures. It is part of the rationale behind the UK National Timing Centre's research programme.

A further consideration is that the global supply chain for timing systems — from atomic clocks, time distribution and monitoring systems to user equipment — is currently sparse and lacks diversity. The ubiquity and utility of GNSS for time has resulted in industry investing in and developing receivers that are low in size, weight, power and cost, proliferating dependency on this single solution. (One of us, D.P., is head of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position, Navigation and Timing, led by the University of Glasgow, UK, which runs a programme developing cheaper timing technologies.) A more diverse supply chain needs to be built to provide the enabling technologies to support a national timing infrastructure that can enhance the resilience of time. This needs to be complemented by an upgrade of the skills pipeline.

Private-sector investments in building such a resilient supply chain to provide reliable timing will depend on effective, long-term commitment from governments1. Policy initiatives such as direct public investment, or incentives such as tax credits, interest deferrals and loans, must be immune to political winds of change to truly de-risk such investments. This could be achieved by regulating the minimum holdover time — the length of time any backup system can provide accurate timekeeping — across industries to ensure commitment to build and develop such time-based resilience. Such regulation needs to define the requirements for specific clocks with the accuracy needed to enable each national infrastructure to operate effectively.

The extra revenue-generating opportunity of new timing systems is, on the face of it, limited when compared with the extra costs. A focus solely on managing risk and enhancing the resilience of time systems might not, therefore, be enough to convince firms of the need to invest in supporting the development of terrestrial holdover timing systems.

Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies have transformed our ability to profile gene expression while preserving crucial spatial context within tissues. However, existing ST platforms are constrained by high costs, long turnaround times, low resolution, limited gene coverage and inherently small tissue capture areas, which hinder their broad applications. Here we present iSCALE, a method that reconstructs large-scale, super-resolution gene expression landscapes and automatically annotates cellular-level tissue architecture in samples exceeding capture areas of current ST platforms. The performance of iSCALE was assessed by comprehensive evaluations involving benchmarking experiments, immunohistochemistry staining and manual annotations by pathologists. When applied to multiple sclerosis human brain samples, iSCALE uncovered lesion-associated cellular characteristics undetectable by conventional ST experiments. Our results demonstrate the utility of iSCALE in analyzing large tissues by enabling unbiased annotation, resolving cell type composition, mapping cellular microenvironments and revealing spatial features beyond the reach of standard ST analysis or routine histopathological assessment.

Understanding spatial gene expression distributions across tissues is essential for answering crucial biological questions and uncovering cellular functions, disease mechanisms and tissue development. ST technologies have transformed our ability to profile gene expression across tissues while retaining crucial spatial context1,2,3. However, major barriers to the widespread adoption of commercial ST platforms in biomedical research include high costs, long turnaround times, low resolution, limited gene coverage and inherently small tissue capture areas offered by current ST platforms. Sequencing-based ST platforms, such as Visium4, can sequence the whole transcriptome but lack single-cell resolution and come with a limited standard tissue capture area of 6.5 mm × 6.5 mm. Although Visium offers an extended version with a larger capture area of 11 mm × 11 mm, it is more expensive than the standard version. Additionally, many tissue samples still surpass this size limitation, restricting spatial profiling to a small portion of a biopsy or organ and often missing key biological regions. The recently released Visium HD5 offers subcellular resolution but at considerably higher cost than Visium, and its tissue capture area is only 6.5 mm × 6.5 mm. Imaging-based ST platforms such as MERSCOPE6, CosMx7 and Xenium8 provide subcellular resolution and can handle moderately larger tissues, but the number of genes is limited, and image scanning time is typically extensive. These limitations make commercial ST platforms impractical for large-scale investigations, particularly when studying sizable tissues common in human studies. A recent approach, ‘visiumStitched'9, attempts to extend the spatial profiling window by manually stitching a few Visium captures; however, it requires manual alignment and supports only low-resolution analysis of directly measured regions.

On the other hand, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained histology images, routinely used by clinical pathology laboratories, are considerably more cost-effective than ST. Additionally, the physical size of a standard whole-slide H&E image can be as large as 25 mm × 75 mm, greatly exceeding the capture area of all ST platforms. Previous studies showed correlations between gene expression profiles and histological image characteristics10,11,12,13,14,15, suggesting the feasibility of inferring spatial gene expression from these histology images16,17,18,19,20. Because obtaining histology images from large-sized tissues is easily achievable, this opens the possibility of virtually predicting gene expression directly from histology, overcoming the tissue size limitations of conventional ST platforms.

Here we introduce iSCALE (inferring Spatially resolved Cellular Architectures in Large-sized tissue Environments), a novel machine learning framework designed to predict gene expression for large-sized tissues with cellular-level resolution. By leveraging the gene expression–histological feature relationship, learned from a small set of training ST captures, iSCALE enables comprehensive gene expression prediction and tissue annotation across entire large tissue sections, including regions without direct gene expression measurements. Unlike existing resolution enhancement methods such as iStar16 and RedeHist19, which rely on a single ST capture for prediction, iSCALE aligns and combines information from distinct ST sections and leverages large-sized H&E images to infer gene expression across extensive tissue areas. This is achieved by mapping individual sections onto the full tissue image and integrating information across multiple ST captures to enable spatially continuous gene expression prediction. This flexible framework allows iSCALE to provide a more comprehensive and scalable approach for spatial gene expression analysis compared to current state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate that iSCALE can provide critical insights into disease by generating high-resolution spatial gene expression maps for large tissue sections.

An overview of the iSCALE workflow is shown in Fig. 1. Our goal is to predict gene expression in an H&E image generated from a large-sized tissue section, referred to as the ‘mother image'. The pipeline begins by selecting regions from the same tissue block, potentially spanning adjacent sections, with regions fitting standard ST platform capture areas (Extended Data Fig. 1). This process generates a small set of training ST captures, referred to as ‘daughter captures'. iSCALE then implements spatial clustering analysis on the daughter ST data to guide the alignment of the daughter captures onto the mother image through a human-in-the-loop, semiautomatic process (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). Next, iSCALE harmoniously integrates the gene expression and spatial information across the aligned daughter captures. To construct a gene expression prediction model, iSCALE extracts both global and local tissue structure information from the mother image. Subsequently, a feedforward neural network is employed to learn the relationship between histological image features and gene expression transferred from the aligned daughter captures. The resulting model predicts gene expression for each 8-µm × 8-µm superpixel—corresponding to approximately the size of a single cell—across the entire mother image. Leveraging these predictions, iSCALE further annotates each superpixel in the mother image with cell types and identifies enriched cell types in each tissue region, providing a detailed characterization of tissue architecture at cellular resolution.

iSCALE enables ST analysis in large-sized tissues using a multi-capture study design. A high-resolution mother H&E image is obtained from a large tissue slice while multiple standard-sized daughter ST captures containing both gene expression and spatial information are collected from adjacent slices. iSCALE aligns and integrates the daughter captures based on gene expression, corrects for batch effects and smooths across spatial neighborhoods. Histological features are hierarchically extracted from regions of the mother image and combined with integrated ST data to predict super-resolution gene expression across the entire large tissue section. These predictions are then used for automatic cell type annotation and tissue segmentation. iSCALE also supports out-of-sample predictions for additional tissue sections using only H&E images. px, pixel.

To evaluate the effectiveness of iSCALE, we conducted a benchmarking experiment using a ground truth single-cell gene expression dataset derived from a large gastric cancer tissue section profiled with 10x Xenium (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15164980)21. The section contains 377 genes and spans the full Xenium slide (12 mm × 24 mm), making it ideal for benchmarking. In this experiment, we simulated a scenario where gene expression data were available only from a set of daughter captures, each with size of 3.2 mm × 3.2 mm, mimicking the conditions typically observed in real large tissue studies. Within each daughter capture, we simulated pseudo-Visium data, following the spot size and layout of the Visium platform (Fig. 2a). First, to assess the accuracy of iSCALE's semiautomatic alignment algorithm, we aligned daughter captures using the proposed algorithm described in the Methods section and achieved 99% alignment accuracy (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Next, the iSCALE model was trained using the integrated gene expression data from five daughter captures, assuming their true alignment on the mother image. For comparison, we also predicted gene expression using iStar16 and RedeHist19. Because both iStar and RedeHist can process only one daughter capture at a time to build their prediction models, we applied these algorithms for each daughter capture. As RedeHist requires a reference single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset, we used a gastric tumor scRNA-seq dataset from Cheng et al.22.

a, Overview of the benchmarking design. Ground truth single-cell gene expression data were obtained using 10x Xenium. Five daughter captures, each measuring 3.2 mm × 3.2 mm, were generated with pseudo-Visium gene expression data. Daughter captures were aligned and integrated to generate a training dataset for the iSCALE model. b, Pathologist manual annotation and tissue segmentation across entire tissue sample using the predicted super-resolution gene expressions from iSCALE, iStar and RedeHist. c, Detailed examination of the upper-left region of the tissue. For iStar and RedeHist, segmentation results from the D1-trained model are displayed, as D1 is the only daughter capture among the five that covers the boundary between the tumor and mucosa. d, TLSs annotated by pathologist and detected by iSCALE segmentation.

Figure 2b shows the tissue segmentation results obtained from iSCALE, iStar and RedeHist. iSCALE's segmentation closely resembles the pathologist's manual annotation and successfully identified key tissue structures, including tumor, tumor-infiltrated stroma, mucosa, submucosa, muscle and tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS). In contrast, iStar and RedeHist segmentations varied noticeably across the five models, depending on the daughter capture used for training. For instance, iStar struggled to distinguish between tumor and mucosa when using daughter captures D1 and D5 as the training data. RedeHist performed even more poorly, failing to identify tissue structures regardless of which daughter capture was used as the training data. This is likely due to its inability to correctly detect a large portion of the nuclei (Supplementary Fig. 1), a critical component of its algorithm. To further demonstrate the advantage of iSCALE, we focused on the upper-left region of the tissue containing signet ring cells (Fig. 2c), which are associated with aggressive gastric cancer and poor prognosis and play a critical role in guiding treatment23. iSCALE accurately identified the boundary between the poorly cohesive carcinoma region with signet ring cells and the adjacent gastric mucosa, with its inferred boundary closely aligning with the pathologist's manual annotation. However, both iStar and RedeHist failed to detect this boundary when using daughter capture D1, which covers that boundary for model training (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 2). As another demonstration, we examined the TLSs in this sample. Detecting TLSs in cancer is crucial because they are associated with improved immune responses, enhanced antitumor activity and better patient prognosis, making them key indicators of the tumor microenvironment's immune dynamics24,25,26. As shown in Fig. 2d, cluster 11 (peach color) identified by iSCALE closely aligns with the manually annotated TLSs. In contrast, iStar tends to detect false-positive TLSs, whereas RedeHist exhibited substantially lower detection accuracy (Supplementary Fig. 3). Notably, the daughter capture models that performed well in certain regions often performed poorly for other critical regions, demonstrating considerable variability among predictions. These results underscore the importance of integrating multiple daughter captures to accurately detect fine-grained tissue structures, such as TLSs.

The availability of the ground truth single-cell gene expression data in this benchmarking experiment enables a quantitative evaluation of iSCALE's gene expression prediction accuracy. Although iSCALE was designed for Visium (spot-level) ST data, its prediction model can be readily adapted to use Xenium (cellular-level) ST data for training. In the following evaluations, we compared two versions of iSCALE: iSCALE-Seq, which used pseudo-Visium data for training, and iSCALE-Img, which used Xenium data for training. To evaluate the prediction performance, we focused on the top 100 highly variable genes (HVGs). We computed the following metrics: root mean squared error (RMSE), structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and Pearson correlation. As shown in Fig. 3a,b, iSCALE-Seq outperformed iStar across all evaluation metrics, achieving performance similar to iSCALE-Img, despite being trained on spot-level resolution ST data. RedeHist was excluded from this comparison due to its unsatisfactory performance (Supplementary Fig. 4). Although the Pearson correlation coefficients for iSCALE-Img and iSCALE-Seq were generally low at the superpixel level (8 µm × 8 µm), the correlations improved as the superpixel size increased. Approximately 50% of the genes achieved correlation coefficients greater than 0.45 at a spatial resolution of 32 µm × 32 µm for iSCALE-Seq. Moreover, we observed that low correlation values at the superpixel level, such as r = 0.27 for ACTA2, still resulted in spatial distributions that almost perfectly resembled the ground truth predictions (Fig. 3c). Additionally, the top 100 spatially variable genes, identified by Moran's I, revealed even stronger performance by iSCALE (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Results across all genes in the dataset (Extended Data Fig. 3b) confirm iSCALE's robustness and consistent superior performance compared to iStar.

Statistics were calculated across n = 1,971,625 superpixels. RMSE and SSIM were evaluated at 8-µm spatial resolution, whereas Pearson correlation was assessed at multiple spatial resolutions. iSCALE-Seq: iSCALE trained using pseudo-Visium data daughter captures. iSCALE-Img: iSCALE trained using Xenium data daughter captures. a, For each box plot, the boundaries of the box correspond to the interquartile range (IQR), spanning from the 25th percentile (lower quartile) to the 75th percentile (upper quartile), with the center line indicating the median (50th percentile).

Source data

For illustration purposes, we visualized gene expression predictions by iSCALE and iStar compared to the ground truth single-cell expression measured using Xenium (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 4). Across all examined genes, iSCALE's predictions showed the closest resemblance to the ground truth gene expression. For genes with distinct spatial patterns—for example, MYH11, TFF2, ACTA2 and CAPN8—iStar's predictions were highly dependent on the daughter capture used for training. Notably, the optimal capture varied by gene (Fig. 3c). This highlights the importance of integrating data from all daughter captures when constructing the prediction model, a strength clearly demonstrated by iSCALE.

Next, we evaluated iSCALE's performance for out-of-sample prediction, where the test sample was from a different subject and included only an H&E image with no available gene expression data. For this benchmarking experiment, we used two normal gastric tissue sections from different subjects (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15164978 and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15164947)27,28, both profiled using the 10x Xenium platform with 377 genes. Each tissue section was relatively large, spanning the entire Xenium slide. For this scenario, we assumed that gene expression data were available from only 10 daughter captures (each 2 mm × 2 mm) in the training sample (Normal 1) (Fig. 4a), whereas the test sample (Normal 2) had no gene expression data. We also simulated eight daughter captures (each 2 mm × 2 mm) in Normal 2 (Fig. 4a) to compare iSCALE's out-of-sample and in-sample predictions. As shown in Fig. 4b, the segmentation result from the out-of-sample predictions closely aligns with that from the cellular-level in-sample prediction and pathologist annotation, achieving an adjusted Rand index of 0.74 when comparing the two segmentations.

a, Overview of the benchmarking design. Ground truth gene expression data were obtained using 10x Xenium. Ten daughter captures for Normal 1 (N1) and eight daughter captures for Normal 2 (N2), each measuring 2 mm × 2 mm, were generated with pseudo-Visium gene expression data. Daughter captures were aligned and integrated to generate a training dataset for the iSCALE model. b, Pathologist manual annotation and tissue segmentations using the predicted gene expressions from the in-sample and out-of-sample analyses for Normal 2. c, Quantitative comparison of iSCALE in-sample and out-of-sample predictions by chi-squared statistic and Spearman correlation for the top 100 HVGs, with statistics calculated across n = 1,352,947 superpixels. Gene expression predictions were binarized using the threshold 0.025. Chi-squared statistic was calculated at a spatial resolution of 8 µm, whereas Spearman correlation was evaluated across multiple spatial resolutions. For the chi-squared statistic, the red dashed lines indicate significance thresholds set at α = 0.05. For each box plot, the boundaries of the box correspond to the IQR, spanning from the 25th percentile (lower quartile) to the 75th percentile (upper quartile), with the center line indicating the median (50th percentile). Whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5× IQR from the lower and upper quartiles, respectively. d, Visualization of ground truth gene expression directly measured by Xenium and predicted super-resolution gene expression by iSCALE in-sample and out-of-sample predictions, shown at the 8-µm spatial resolution. The visualizations include the predicted gene expression magnitude and the corresponding binary predictions. χ2, chi-squared.

Source data

We further evaluated the accuracy of gene expression predictions for the top 100 HVGs. Because the range of gene expression is unobserved for out-of-sample predictions, evaluation metrics such as RMSE, SSIM and Pearson correlation, which rely on the magnitude of gene expression, are not suitable. Instead, we used Spearman correlation, which is rank based, and introduced a chi-squared statistic to assess overall concordance between binarized (that is, expressed or not expressed) gene expression patterns from the ground truth and predictions. As shown in Fig. 4c, 99 of the 100 genes exhibited significantly concordant out-of-sample predicted expression patterns with the ground truth. Although the correlations for out-of-sample predictions were lower than those for in-sample predictions, at the spatial resolution of 64 µm, approximately 50% of the genes achieved correlation coefficients greater than 0.45. Although predicting gene expression magnitude is challenging, out-of-sample predictions yielded correlation coefficients similar to in-sample performance. Figure 4d and Extended Data Fig. 5 present a few representative genes with varying spatial patterns, demonstrating iSCALE's strong concordance between both in-sample and out-of-sample predictions and the ground truth expression patterns.

Encouraged by the promising performance of iSCALE in benchmark evaluations, we next applied the method to data generated from a postmortem human brain of a patient with multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a chronic inflammatory disorder that affects the central nervous system by mistakenly attacking the myelin sheath of nerve fibers, leading to inflammation and damage, which disrupts electrical impulse transmission along nerves29,30,31. Our focus is on cellular alterations in MS, specifically changes in abundance, distribution and activity of different cell types within and near MS lesions. Identifying distinct cellular profiles around MS lesions can offer insights into the disease's pathology, the immune response it provokes and potential therapeutic targets.

To characterize cell attributes associated with MS lesions, we analyzed a tissue block (Sample 1) containing an active core and complete white matter chronic active lesion from a patient with MS (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15151354)32. Because the size of the mother tissue section (approximately 22 mm × 19 mm = 418 mm2) greatly exceeded the standard ST capture area (Extended Data Fig. 6), we obtained 11 smaller daughter captures from the same tissue block following the large-tissue multi-capture study design in Fig. 1. These captures underwent gene expression analysis using the standard 10x Visium protocol with tissue capture area of 6.5 mm × 6.5 mm (Supplementary Table 1). Using the iSCALE alignment process described in the Methods section, we aligned these daughter captures onto the mother image (Fig. 5a, Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. 5). Traditional ST analysis, which relies solely on observed spot-level gene expression from directly measured daughter captures, would be inadequate due to its low-resolution, spot-level segmentation and limited coverage of critical regions, such as the lesion rim and core. In contrast, iSCALE integrates gene expression information from 11 daughter captures across different regions to train a super-resolution gene expression prediction model for the entire large tissue section. For this analysis, iSCALE predicted the expression of the top 3,000 HVGs, along with 145 additional key cell type markers selected based on in-house single-nucleus RNA sequencing data generated from the same brain. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 6, the iSCALE pipeline successfully removed gene expression batch effects across all daughter captures. In total, iSCALE predicted super-resolution gene expression for the entire mother image, consisting of 2,013,871 superpixels, after downsampling for computational purposes. These super-resolution gene expression data allowed iSCALE to segment the tissue and identify regions closely matching pathologist manual annotation (Fig. 5a). iSCALE successfully detected the white matter chronic lesion core (purple cluster), the rim with increased microglial activation (red cluster), normal-appearing white matter (orange cluster) and normal-appearing gray matter (blue and green clusters) continuously across the whole mother image.

a, Mother H&E image with pathologist manual annotation, observed Visium data from 11 daughter captures obtained from adjacent tissue sections containing 36,912 spatial observations, alignment of daughter captures onto the mother image and segmentation using iSCALE's predicted gene expressions for 2,013,871 superpixels. b, Experimental validation of iSCALE's predicted gene expression using IHC stains obtained for critical markers MOG and CD68 on adjacent tissue sections. Binarized gene expression is shown for iSCALE and iStar, where a superpixel is considered expressed if its value exceeds the 25th percentile of all MOG predictions or the 25th percentile among those with expression >0.05 for CD68. Different thresholds were used because the expression range of MOG is much larger than that of CD68. Because the expression values were standardized to the range [0, 1], using a lower threshold for MOG ensures that the absolute thresholds are more comparable between MOG and CD68. c, Cell type annotation of Sample 1 using the predicted super-resolution gene expression from iSCALE across the whole mother capture. d, Cell type enrichment analysis for the identified clusters from iSCALE.

An overlay of iSCALE segmentation on the mother H&E image (left), followed by close-up views of high-resolution H&E for four biological regions corresponding to iSCALE-identified clusters. ALR, active lesion rim; NAGM, normal-appearing gray matter; NAWM, normal-appearing white matter; WMILC, white matter inactive lesion core; E-neuron, excitatory neuron; IFNγ, interferon gamma; I-neuron, inhibitory neuron; Micro iron, iron-rich microglia; OL, oligodendrocyte; OPC, oligodendrocyte precursor cell; PVM, perivascular macrophage; Vascu, vascular.

Next, we assessed iSCALE's prediction accuracy using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. This technique was used to validate iSCALE's predictions for critical markers essential for identifying and classifying MS lesions, including MOG (used to discern MS lesion types based on reduced MOG immunoreactivity, indicative of demyelination) and CD68 (an activation marker of monocyte lineage). As shown in Fig. 5b, the iSCALE gene expression predictions agreed with the IHC staining patterns obtained from adjacent tissue sections. Specifically, consistent with the demyelinated nature of the MS lesion, iSCALE predicted negligible expression of MOG within the white matter chronic active lesion core. Furthermore, iSCALE's predictions indicate the presence of CD68 expression along the annotated rim of the lesion border, a pattern undetected by iStar using any of the representative daughter captures (Fig. 5b). For an in-depth analysis, we compared the observed spot-level gene expression and the predicted super-resolution gene expression for key marker genes. We illustrate this agreement for PLP1 (white matter, oligodendrocyte marker), SLC17A7 (gray matter, neuron marker) and HLA–DRA (active immune response, microglia marker), along with additional MS-related and cell type marker genes (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Fig. 7). The predicted expression aligned closely with the spatial distribution observed in the tissues while providing substantially enhanced spatial resolution and comprehensive tissue coverage.

We further show that the super-resolution gene expression predictions by iSCALE can provide deeper insights into the cellular attributes associated with MS lesions. Using the super-resolution gene expression prediction, iSCALE automatically annotates cell types for each superpixel (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 8). We observed distinct spatial distributions of different cell types across the normal and diseased portions of the tissue, including a high density of oligodendrocytes in the normal-appearing white matter, inhibitory neurons and excitatory neurons in the gray matter, fibrous astrocytes subpopulation C (Astro fibro C) within the inactive lesion core and a mixture of iron-rich microglial and T cells in the lesion rim (Fig. 5c). By inferring cell types within these superpixels, we gained insights into the spatial distribution and diversity of cell populations within the tissue. This is particularly valuable in regions of tissue that are challenging to differentiate through histological inspection or gene expression profiling alone. For instance, the red cluster, corresponding to the active lesion rim, is enriched with immune response-related cell types, including T cells, B cells and several microglia subpopulations, such as iron-rich microglia and foamy microglia, along with infiltrated T cells within the lesion (Fig. 5d). These subpopulations are challenging for pathologists to discern from H&E images. As a comparison, we performed cell type annotation using iStar-predicted gene expressions. Unsurprisingly, the annotations were highly variable depending on which daughter capture was used for model training, and the cells were frequently annotated in locations that did not align with biological expectations. For instance, when daughter captures 612-1, 612-4 and 695-4 were used for model training, iStar predicted a high volume of inhibitory neurons in the white matter lesion core, a result that contradicts established knowledge of MS lesion biology (Extended Data Fig. 9).

To further validate the biological relevance of the iSCALE segmentation results, we compared key tissue regions: normal-appearing gray matter (clusters 1 and 2, region a), normal-appearing white matter (cluster 3, region b), active lesion rim (cluster 5, region c) and inactive lesion core (cluster 4, region d). As shown in Fig. 5e, these regions reveal distinct histological features in the H&E image. Although the inactive core exhibits fibrous structures, the active rim is denser and more heterogeneous with a mixture of immune cells. The pathologist (E.P.) confirmed that cluster 5 aligns with the hypercellular rim containing reactive microglia and that cluster 3 reflects white matter with less smoldering microglial neuroinflammation.

In this section, we explore the feasibility of using the prediction model trained on Sample 1 to predict gene expression in another MS sample. The test sample, Sample 2, was obtained from a different region of the same MS brain. Sample 2 contains a complete white matter chronic active lesion and regionally distributed active and chronic subpial cortical demyelination, as identified by manual pathologist annotation (Fig. 6a) (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15151517)33. This sample measures approximately 22.3 mm × 23.6 mm (567.7 mm2) and consists of 2,042,781 superpixels, after downsampling for computational purposes, each measuring 8 µm × 8 µm. Similar to Sample 1, gene expression in Sample 2 was originally measured using six daughter captures from the 10x Visium platform, representing only a limited area of the tissue (Supplementary Fig. 9). To demonstrate iSCALE's out-of-sample prediction capability, we applied the model trained on Sample 1's daughter captures to predict super-resolution gene expression and performed tissue segmentation in Sample 2. For comparison, we also trained iSCALE using the six daughter captures from Sample 2 for in-sample predictions. As shown in Fig. 6a, the segmentation obtained from out-of-sample predictions in Sample 2 resembles the in-sample segmentation achieved using Sample 2's own daughter captures and aligned well with the overall tissue structure annotated by the pathologist. We further validated iSCALE's out-of-sample predictions using IHC staining for MOG and CD68 obtained from adjacent tissue sections and observed that iSCALE accurately inferred the expected general locations for both markers (Fig. 6b).

The subpanels include the mother H&E image with pathologist manual annotation, alignment of six daughter captures onto the mother image and segmentations using iSCALE's predicted gene expressions.

Right, cell type annotations derived from iSCALE's in-sample predictions. e, Cell type enrichment analysis by cluster using iSCALE's in-sample predictions.

Next, we evaluated iSCALE's performance in cell typing for out-of-sample predictions (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. 10). This is more challenging than the benchmarking experiment, as the two normal samples, although from different patients, are structurally similar. In contrast, the two MS samples, although originating from the same brain, exhibit distinct lesion characteristics. Sample 1 contains an active core and complete white matter chronic active lesion, whereas Sample 2 contains a chronic active lesion and areas of active and chronic subpial cortical demyelination (Supplementary Fig. 11). Despite these marked differences between the MS samples, the out-of-sample predictions in Sample 2 successfully inferred inhibitory neurons in the gray matter cortical regions, with the locations closely matching those inferred from in-sample predictions (Fig. 6c). In addition, the out-of-sample predictions in Sample 2 mapped T cells to the expected lesion rim and astrocytes to the expected normal-appearing white matter. Although iSCALE's out-of-sample prediction is currently limited to revealing broad tissue architecture through segmentation and identifying a limited number of cell types, these promising results were achieved even across samples with distinct pathology.

Notably, iSCALE's in-sample segmentation for Sample 2 closely aligned with the pathologist's manual annotation and detected the expected cortical layer structure when the number of clusters increased (Extended Data Fig. 10). We also observed strong alignment between the identified clusters and the iSCALE cell type annotation (Fig. 6d). Notably, too, cluster 3 (green) corresponded well with oligodendrocytes and the normal-appearing white matter in the pathologist's annotation. Additionally, astrocytes (Astro fibro C), T cells and oligodendrocytes were identified throughout cluster 4 (red) corresponding to the white matter chronic active lesion (Fig. 6d,e and Supplementary Fig. 12). Furthermore, predicted biomarkers using in-sample predictions revealed tissue regions that posed challenges for manual annotation. For instance, the subpial demyelination in the cortex was annotated by the pathologist using the mother H&E image and IHC staining for MOG obtained from an adjacent tissue section (Fig. 6a,b and Supplementary Fig. 11). This introduced uncertainty in defining the borders of subpial demyelination, highlighting the challenges that pathologists face when relying on IHC staining from different adjacent slices. In contrast, iSCALE provides simultaneous predictions for all markers and enables automatic annotation on the same large tissue sample, offering a more integrated and consistent approach for tissue analysis.

In summary, we presented iSCALE, an innovative framework for rapid gene expression prediction, cell type annotation and tissue segmentation for comprehensive ST analysis of large-sized tissues, extending beyond the capabilities of conventional ST platforms. By integrating high-resolution large-scale histology images with ST data from a small set of daughter captures, iSCALE effectively processes large tissue samples. Using benchmarking data from gastric cancer and normal gastric tissues, we demonstrated iSCALE's effectiveness in semiautomatic daughter capture alignment and its ability to accurately predict super-resolution gene expression across the entire large tissue. When applied to MS brain samples, iSCALE further demonstrated its utility in assisting scientists in high-throughput and unbiased tissue annotation of entire lesions, inferring cell type compositions and pinpointing regions of interest with features not easily discernible through human visual assessment alone.

Although we demonstrated the utility of iSCALE primarily using Visium, the framework is versatile enough to be applied to other ST platforms34,35,36 and helps improve our ability to uncover meaningful functions and insights from genomic data. For example, iSCALE can employ a set of selected fields of view (FOVs) in CosMx to train the gene expression prediction model, which will enable the prediction of single-cell resolution gene expression in tissue regions outside those FOVs, thereby expanding gene expression coverage to the entire tissue section. Despite this flexibility, iSCALE does not directly account for experimental design considerations, such as the strategic and optimized selection of daughter capture regions. Future research focused on systematic approaches for region-of-interest (ROI) selection, and determining the optimal number of captures could further improve data acquisition strategies and enhance the accuracy and efficiency of downstream analyses.

Furthermore, this paper also highlights the ability of iSCALE to perform out-of-sample prediction—a highly challenging task due to the absence of observed gene expression and heterogeneity between the training and test data, especially in disease contexts. Although our results remain preliminary, given the limited training data in both the benchmarking and real-world scenarios, they carry major practical implications. H&E-stained histology images are widely accessible, cost-effective to generate and well suited for large tissue sections. We anticipate that, as more ST data are available, iSCALE will benefit from the increased training data. iSCALE's capability for out-of-sample prediction could substantially reduce experimental costs, making large-scale ST studies more feasible.

In summary, iSCALE is a computational tool that can help enhance understanding of spatial tissue architecture at the cellular level, offering valuable insights for a wide range of human diseases. This capability has the potential to make substantial contributions to future advancements in human healthcare. With the increasing adoption of ST in biomedical research, we anticipate that iSCALE will have broad applications, particularly in human studies involving large-sized tissues.

All research was conducted in accordance with relevant ethical regulations. The human gastric tissue study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of the Seoul Metropolitan Government–Seoul National University Boramae Medical Center (IRB no. 30-2023-1). The human MS brain tissue study was approved by the Multicentre Research Ethics Committee (08/MRE09/31+5) through the Multiple Sclerosis Society Tissue Bank at Imperial College London.

In the gastric tissue study, samples were obtained from a 63-year-old female (BS06-9313; Patient 1, Tumor and Normal 1) and a 61-year-old male (AMS-47004; Patient 2, Normal 2). The gastric cancer sample was previously profiled using the 10x Xenium platform as described in Coleman et al.15. In the present study, we generated two additional Xenium datasets from normal gastric tissues. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections (5 μm) from two normal blocks were mounted on Xenium slides. Slides were deparaffinized at 60 °C for 2 hours, followed by 10 minutes in xylene jar 1 and 3 minutes sequentially in xylene jar 2, 100% ethanol jars 1 and 2, 96% ethanol jars 1 and 2 and 70% ethanol. After a 20-second water rinse, RNA decrosslinking was performed at 80 °C for 30 minutes. Probe hybridization using the 10x Human Multi-Tissue and Cancer Gene Panel V1 (377 genes) was carried out at 50 °C for 18 hours. Following protocol CG000582 (revision E), unhybridized probes were washed at 37 °C for 30 minutes, followed by 18-hour probe ligation at 37 °C and 18-hour rolling circle amplification at 30 °C. Background autofluorescence was quenched, and nuclei were fluorescently stained. Imaging was performed on the Xenium Analyzer (protocol CG000584, revision C), which conducted 15 automated cycles of probe hybridization, imaging and removal (firmware version 1.7.6.0). Image processing, including co-registration, probe filtering and nuclei/cell segmentation, was performed using xenium-1.7.1.0 software.

Postmortem human brain tissue was obtained from a 59-year-old female patient with secondary progressive MS. Two regions were sampled: one containing an active core and a chronic active lesion (Sample 1) and another containing a chronic active lesion and regionally distributed active and chronic subpial cortical demyelination (Sample 2). Fresh frozen tissue blocks were provided by Imperial College London. Blocks were equilibrated to −23 °C in a cryostat for at least 30 minutes using minimal optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound, gently faced and sectioned to obtain full-face slices. Before and after Visium slide collection, four 10-μm-thick serial sections were mounted on Superfrost Plus Gold glass slides, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 15 minutes and washed twice in PBS (10 minutes each). Slides were air dried and used for H&E, CD68 and MOG staining. CD68 and MOG staining were performed on a Leica BOND RXm or a Ventana Discovery Ultra automated stainer using standard chromogenic protocols. For antigen retrieval and permeabilization, slides were heated in EDTA buffer (pH 9) at 94 °C for 25 minutes, followed by 30-minute antibody incubation (CD68: 1:2,250, Cell Signaling Technology, D4B9C, no. 76437; MOG: 1:2,000, Abcam, EPR22629-310, no. ab233549). Bound antibodies were detected using an HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary polymer and visualized with DAB and hematoxylin counterstaining. Oil Red O (ORO) staining, previously performed by Imperial College London, was used to identify lipid-laden microglia/macrophages. Whole-slide images were acquired on a Pannoramic 250 digital scanner (PerkinElmer).

MS lesion types were characterized by the relative absence of MOG immunoreactivity, indicating demyelinating regions. The reactivity of lesion types was further characterized by the activity of CD68 and ORO stain. White matter lesion types were classified into active, chronic active and chronic lesion according to Kuhlmann et al.37. In brief, white matter active lesion was characterized by the loss of MOG reactivity and the presence of large numbers of lipid-laden macrophage/microglia cells with CD68 reactivity and positive ORO stain. White matter chronic active lesion was characterized by demyelinated lesion with CD68 immunoreactivity forming a rim at the lesion border. The active rim was annotated surrounding the white matter chronic active lesion with the presence of an extensive CD68-positive cellular infiltrate, corresponding to macrophages/activated microglia as described by Absinta et al.38. Inactive lesion was annotated by demyelinated lesion with a few ramified CD68-positive cells. Cortical gray matter lesion was characterized by the loss of MOG reactivity at gray matter regions and further subtyping into subpial, leukocortical and intracortical lesions39,40. Lesions showing loss of myelin indicated by MOG staining from the outer layer into the cortex were classified as subpial lesions.

To collect tissues onto Visium Spatial Gene Expression slides (10x Genomics Slide Kit, ref. no. 1000185), a pre-chilled razor blade was used to gently score the surface of the frozen tissue block in a grid format to subdivide the tissue for placement on individual capture areas. Slides were pre-chilled prior to collection of tissue sections, and individual sections were collected onto slides by placing a fingertip on the back of the slide to promote tissue capture. Frozen slides were then processed for ST analysis according to the manufacturer's instructions (10x Visium ‘Tissue Staining & Imaging'). Sections were heated at 37 °C for 1 minute, followed by methanol fixation at −20 °C for 30 minutes. Samples were then stained with H&E. Brightfield images were collected on an Olympus VS120 Virtual Slide Microscope equipped with a VC50 camera using a UPLSAPO ×20 objective. After imaging, tissue permeabilization was carried out using the supplied permeabilization buffer at 37 °C for 6 minutes. Permeabilization time was selected based on a prior optimization experiment in mouse tissues using Visium Spatial Tissue Optimization slides (10x Genomics, ref. no. 1000193). After permeabilization, reverse transcription was carried out on-slide according to Visium guidelines.

A critical step in iSCALE is aligning daughter captures onto the mother image. Given that the daughter captures are often derived from different tissue sections and exhibit drastically different shapes, existing alignment methods fall short of adequately addressing the complexity of these data. To overcome these challenges, we developed a semiautomatic, human-in-the-loop alignment approach. This method streamlines the alignment process while maintaining the flexibility needed to handle complex data structures. The approach involves the following steps:

Step 1: Clustering spatial gene expression data in daughter captures. Apply spatial clustering algorithms—for example, BayesSpace41—to cluster gene expression data in daughter captures. We recommend generating 2–4 clusters to minimize noisy clustering patterns. The resulting clusters can then be used to facilitate the identification of key points in Step 2.

Step 2: Identify key point pairs between a daughter capture and the mother image. Identify at least four key point pairs between a daughter capture and the mother image. Use the clustering results from Step 1 as a guide to locate key points by comparing the clustering patterns observed in the daughter capture with the histological patterns in the mother image.

Step 3: Find a transformation for alignment. Use the key point pairs identified in Step 2 as input for the RANSAC algorithm implemented in OpenCV to determine a transformation between the daughter capture and the mother image. This transformation enables the alignment of the daughter capture onto the mother image.

Step 4: Align a new daughter capture. Select a new daughter capture and identify key point pairs between this capture and the mother image. Leverage the clustering results of both the new daughter capture and the previously aligned daughter capture to guide the identification of key point pairs between the new daughter capture and the mother image. Apply the RANSAC algorithm, as outlined in Step 3, to find the transformation and align the new daughter capture onto the mother image.

Step 5: Repeat alignment of remaining daughter captures. Continue the above alignment process until no additional daughter captures can be aligned.

The semiautomatic procedure described above requires minimal manual work and is relatively straightforward to implement. Extended Data Fig. 2 provides an example to illustrate how this alignment algorithm works.

To construct the iSCALE training dataset, we integrate location and gene expression information from individual ST experiments. Let qs denote the number of spatial observations in daughter capture s and define the total number of observations as \(Q={\sum }_{s=1}^{S}{q}_{s}\). For each daughter capture \(s\in \{1,\ldots ,S\}\), we define the spatial coordinate matrix \({\phi }_{s}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{{q}_{s}\times2}\), where each row corresponds to the (x, y) coordinates of a spot. To combine the spatial locations across all captures, we concatenate the aligned coordinate matrices \({\phi }_{1},\ldots ,{\phi }_{S}\) into a single matrix \(L\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{Q\times 2}\).

Next, we combine gene expression data from multiple daughter captures. Let τs be the set of all genes measured in capture s with length ws. We define \({G}_{s}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{{q}_{s}{\times w}_{s}}\) as the gene expression matrix for daughter capture s, where each row corresponds to a spatial measurement (that is, spot or cell), and each column corresponds to a gene. Let \(\gamma =\mathop{\bigcap }\nolimits_{s=1}^{S}{\tau }_{s}\) represent the intersection of genes shared across all captures with length |γ| = φ. To ensure comparability, we subset each expression matrix to include only genes in γ defining the reduced matrices as \({G}_{s}^{* }={G}_{s}(:,\gamma )\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{{q}_{s}\times \varphi }.\) We concatenate the reduced matrices along the spatial axis to form a unified expression matrix \(G^{*} \in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{Q\times \varphi }\). This matrix serves as a large training dataset covering spatially distinct regions of the tissue section. To further integrate information across partially overlapping daughter captures, iSCALE applies a smoothing step based on dense spatial neighborhoods defined by a distance threshold d. Within each dense neighborhood, both spatial coordinates and gene expression values are averaged to propagate information across adjacent slices. This results in a smoothed expression matrix \(\widetilde{{{G}}}\) and location matrix \(\widetilde{L}\). This integration ensures consistency across slices by effectively smoothing spatially overlapping regions.

After constructing the gene expression training dataset, iSCALE automatically selects the top HVGs across all spatial locations. The user specifies the desired number of HVGs to be selected and can optionally modify this list to include additional genes of biological or clinical interest. Let \(\mho\) denote the final set of genes used to train the iSCALE model, where \(\mho \subseteq \gamma\) and the total number of selected genes is K = |℧|. Accordingly, we subset the expression matrix \(\widetilde{{{G}}}\) to obtain \({\widetilde{{{G}}}}^{{\boldsymbol{* }}}=\widetilde{{{G}}}(:,\mho )\).

Integrating gene expression data from multiple ST captures can introduce batch effects, potentially obscuring biological signals. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 6a, this issue was evident in MS Sample 1, where daughter captures formed distinct clusters in the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) space. To address this, iSCALE applies a minimum–maximum normalization across all daughter captures, scaling each gene to the [0, 1] range. Let \({\mathcal{G}}\) denote the normalized gene expression matrix, where each gene ‘k' is scaled as:

using the minimum and maximum expression across all spatial locations. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 6b, this procedure effectively mitigates batch effects, resulting in mixed expression profiles from different captures. iSCALE also generates pre-normalization and post-normalization UMAP plots to visualize batch effects and assess correction. If residual effects remain, users may consider alternative methods such as z-score normalization or batch correction tools such as CarDEC42 or Scanorama43 prior to model training.

Although histology images were leveraged to analyze ST data in previous works12,18,44,45, their use of histology information does not fully leverage the rich cellular information provided by high-resolution histology images. In practice, a pathologist examines histology images hierarchically—first identifying ROI by assessing high-level image features that capture global tissue structure and then examining low-level features reflecting local cellular structures.

To standardize resolution, each histology image is first rescaled so that the size of each pixel is 0.5 × 0.5 μm, making a 16 × 16-pixel tile correspond to an 8 × 8-μm2 area—approximately the size of a single cell. Next, mimicking this hierarchical review process computationally, we implement a multiscale image feature extraction strategy that captures both global and local tissue structures. This histology image feature extraction approach employs the Vision Transformer (ViT)46 in a hierarchical manner and extracts essential tissue details by breaking down the tissue image processing into stages. It starts by analyzing smaller tissue sections for the fine details, subsequently scaling up to grasp broader tissue patterns. Details of this image feature extraction were described in iStar16.

Previously, the method iStar16 was developed to enhance spatial resolution using a single ST sample as both input and training data. In our setting, however, there are multiple ST samples obtained from adjacent tissue slices, and the large target mother image lacks direct gene expression measurements. To address this, we incorporate multiple training ST samples and perform out-of-sample super-resolution gene expression prediction for the missing tissue regions. Histology features from the large-scale mother image are extracted as \(H={\left[{h}_{{mn}}\right]}_{m=1,n=1}^{M^{\prime} ,N^{\prime} }\), and gene expression prediction is performed by training on the integrated daughter data, \({\mathcal{G}}\), to minimize the specified objective function.

Specifically, when the daughter capture is from a sequencing-based ST platform, such as 10x Visium, then iSCALE integrates histology features and ST data using a spot-level weakly supervised loss function, allowing differences in spatial resolution between training and prediction. The loss, \({{\mathcal{L}}}_{\rm{{Seq}}}\), is computed over all observed spots \(q\in Q\) where \({g}_{k}\) is the prediction model for gene k; \({{\mathcal{M}}}_{q}\) is the spot mask of q (the collection of superpixels covered by spot q); and hmn is the histology feature at superpixel (m, n):

When the daughter captures are from an imaging-based ST platform, such as 10x Xenium or CosMx, iSCALE employs a directly supervised loss function using gene expression labels available at the superpixel level during training:

where P denotes the set of superpixels across all daughter captures. After model training, gene expression at each superpixel (m, n) in the mother image is predicted as \({\hat{y}}_{{kmn}}={g}_{k}({h}_{{mn}})\), yielding the continuous super-resolution gene expression image \({\hat{Y}}_{k}=[\;{\hat{y}}_{{kmn}}]_{m=1,n=1}^{{M}^{{\prime} },{N}^{{\prime} }}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{{M}^{{\prime} }{N}^{{\prime} }}\) across the entire large-scale mother image for each gene k.

A multilayer perceptron architecture was used, consisting of a feedforward neural network with four hidden layers, each containing 256 neurons and employing a leaky rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function (α = 0.1). The model was trained with a batch size of 100 using the Adam optimizer (learning rate 1 × 10−3) for 1,000 epochs across three random initialization states. The loss function minimized the difference between predicted and observed gene expression, at either the spot level (iSCALE-Seq) or the superpixel level (iSCALE-Img), depending on the resolution of the training data. No formal hyperparameter optimization was conducted; instead, architecture and training parameters were chosen based on prior experience and performance evaluation using RMSE loss. Training and validation were conducted on an NVIDIA graphics processing unit (GPU) with 64 GB of memory to accommodate the largest tissue sample.

We ran iSCALE on a server equipped with an NVIDIA GPU (driver version 550.54.15, CUDA 12.4). For the MS data, we used a single GPU with 64 GB of memory for Sample 1 and 32 GB of memory for Sample 2. The process of extracting histology image features, smoothing and exporting data took approximately 13 minutes for Sample 1 and 15 minutes for Sample 2. Integrating data across daughter captures, training the gene expression prediction model (1,000 epochs, repeated for three random states), predicting gene expression and exporting super-resolution gene expression data for 1,000 genes required 1 hour and 35 minutes for Sample 1 and 54 minutes for Sample 2.

The predicted gene expression can be used for tissue segmentation through clustering analysis with the k-means algorithm. iSCALE provides two options for this clustering analysis. The first option uses the embedding from the last hidden layer in the gene expression prediction neural network model as input, and the second option uses principal components derived from the predicted gene expression as input. By the end of the clustering analysis, iSCALE partitions the tissue into functionally distinct regions in an unsupervised manner based on their gene expression profiles.

To support interpretation of segmented tissue regions and reveal cell population heterogeneity, iSCALE performs cell type inference at the superpixel level across the full tissue section. Each superpixel is treated as an artificial cell, with its cell type label inferred using iSCALE-predicted gene expression and a marker gene reference panel. The traditional score-based approach from iStar16 often yields overdominant predictions, assigning a single cell type broadly—especially when marker genes have outlier or inflated expression, which is more likely when training data come from multiple ST captures. To address this, iSCALE introduces key modifications for more robust cell type annotation.

Let V be the total number of candidate cell types in the marker reference set. For each cell type \(v\in \{1,\ldots ,V\;\}\), suppose that we have a list of marker gene names ψv. In iSCALE, we apply a filtering criterion based on prediction uncertainty for genes in the marker set. Specifically, we compute the training RMSE for each gene and remove those exceeding the 95th percentile across all genes, yielding a refined marker set \({\psi }_{v}^{* }\). This step eliminates genes that are poorly predicted in the training set from being selected as a candidate for cell typing. For each gene in \({\psi }_{v}^{* }\), we then compute its percentile expression across all superpixels in the tissue. For each marker gene, the predicted super-resolution gene expression is transformed to \({\widetilde{Y}}_{k}^{* }=[\;{\widetilde{y}}_{{kmn}}^{* }]_{m=1,n=1}^{{M}^{{\prime} },{N}^{{\prime} }}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{{M}^{{\prime} }{N}^{{\prime} }}\), where we define \({\widetilde{y}}_{{kmn}}^{* }={\sum }_{{\rm{i}}=1}^{{M}^{{\prime} }{N}^{{\prime} }}1({\hat{Y}}_{k}\le {\hat{y}}_{{kmn}})/{(M}^{{\prime} }{N}^{{\prime} })\) with \({1(\hat{Y}}_{k}\le {\hat{y}}_{{kmn}})\), representing an indicator function that equals 1 if \({\hat{Y}}_{k}\le {\hat{y}}_{{kmn}}\) and 0 otherwise. This transformation standardizes the data into the range of [0, 1] while removing the large impact of outlying or overpredicted expression on the marker score calculation. For each superpixel (m, n), we compute the score, uvmn, for each cell type v by averaging the percentile transformed gene expression across its marker genes: \({u}_{{vmn}}=|{{\psi }_{v}^{* }|}^{-1}\sum _{k\in {\psi }_{v}^{* }}{\widetilde{y}}_{{kmn}}^{* }\), where \(\left|{\psi }_{v}^{* }\right|\) is the number of genes in \({\psi }_{v}^{* }\). To infer the cell type of superpixel (m, n), let \({t}_{{mn}}^{\max}=\mathop{{\rm{arg}}}\limits_{1\le {\rm{v}}\le {\rm{V}}}\max {u}_{{tmn}}\) be the cell type with the maximal score and \({u}_{{mn}}^{\max }=\mathop{\max }\limits_{1\le {\rm{v}}\le {\rm{V}}}{u}_{{tmn}}\) be the score of this cell type. Given a predetermined threshold \({u}_{{{\rm{threshold}}}}\in \left[0.0,1.0\right]\), if \({{u}_{{mn}}^{\max } > u}_{{{\rm{threshold}}}}\), then the cell type of superpixel (m, n) is predicted to be \({v}_{{mn}}^{\max }\); otherwise, the cell type of this superpixel is unclassified. In our experiments, we set \({u}_{{{\rm{threshold}}}}=0.05\) and found it effective in most cases.

Overall, the adjusted score-based approach sets thresholds more consistently across datasets with varying magnitudes of imputed expression and reduces reliance on arbitrary cutoffs typical of standard methods. The percentile adjustment mitigates the influence of outlier genes with high predicted expression that might otherwise skew scores and lead to a dominant cell type label, improving robustness to marker gene selection. Although our pipeline uses this percentile-based scoring, iSCALE also allows users to apply any preferred cell type annotation method to the predicted super-resolution gene expression. After cell type inference, iSCALE performs enrichment analysis by identifying abundant cell types within each tissue cluster to reveal biological activity for different spatial regions.

For in-sample predictions, we evaluated model performance using three metrics per gene. First, RMSE was calculated as \(1/\sqrt{n}\) times the Euclidean distance between observed and predicted expression across n superpixels. Expression values were normalized to [0, 1], allowing RMSE to quantify the accuracy of vectorized predictions. Second, we used the SSIM, which assesses both intensity and spatial structural similarity between expression images; SSIM scores range from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect similarity. Third, Pearson correlation was used to assess the linear relationship between observed and predicted values.

For out-of-sample predictions, where absolute gene expression magnitudes in the test data are unobserved, we instead applied Spearman correlation, which compares the ranks of expression values. We also evaluated concordance between binarized ground truth and predicted expression using a chi-squared test, categorizing gene expression as ‘expressed' or ‘not expressed' based on a predefined threshold. This test follows a chi-squared distribution with 1 degree of freedom under the null hypothesis of no association. Resulting P values were corrected for multiple testing across genes using the Bonferroni method. To account for extremely high values, the \({-\log }_{10}P\) metric was capped at a maximum of 10; values exceeding this threshold were set to 10.

a, Ideal grid-based layout design: The tissue is divided into a grid, and each section (daughter capture) is profiled using an ST platform (for example 10x Visium). This layout allows for systematic and contiguous spatial coverage of the tissue. b, Real-world adjacent tissue slice design: Daughter captures are obtained from adjacent sections of the same tissue block. Due to technical and experimental challenges of tissue processing, these captures often only partially overlap in the X-Y plane, and gaps may arise, leaving regions of the mother tissue unmeasured.

A time crystal as seen under a microscope.Credit: Zhao & Smalyukh, 2025, Nature Materials

A time crystal is a form of matter that shows continuous, repeating patterns over time, much like how atoms in a normal crystal repeat in space. Examples once existed in only complex, quantum matter, but now physicists have found a way to make a time crystal that can be seen, under certain conditions, with the naked eye.

The feat, accomplished by physicists at the University of Colorado Boulder, and published in Nature Materials on 4 September1, involved liquid crystals — bar-shaped molecules with properties between those of a liquid and those of a solid. Simply by shining a light on the liquid crystals, the team created ripples of twisting molecules through them. The ripples kept moving for hours, undulating with a distinct beat, even when the researchers changed the conditions. The rhythm was also out of sync with any incoming force — fulfilling the two defining criteria for a time crystal.

Although some of this behaviour of liquid crystals was already known, no one had previously considered whether it could be harnessed to make a time crystal, says Young-Ki Kim, a material scientist at the Pohang University of Science and Technology in South Korea.

The macroscopic scale of the time crystal — at millimetres to centimetres across — creates opportunities “to provide deeper understanding” of the phenomena, he says. The distinctive patterns in the crystals could also allow them to be used in anti-counterfeit devices, say the authors.



Nobel prizewinning physicist Frank Wilczek first proposed the idea of a time crystal in 2012. Wilczek's version was almost like a perpetual-motion machine; something that cycled endlessly while in its natural resting state. A team later published a paper that mathematically proved this concept was impossible2, but researchers soon found that other kinds of time crystal were possible. Ordered time crystals could exist, for example, in bizarre systems that were perpetually in flux, rather than at rest.

Time crystals have since been made in a variety of ways, using interacting nanoscale defects in diamonds, trapped ions and simulated on Google's Sycamore quantum computer. But most examples have been at the microscopic scale.

The latest system involves shining a light, even that from a normal light bulb, on a liquid-crystal film trapped between two glass plates. When the light hits photosensitive dye molecules on the glass plates, they switch their orientation, which triggers molecules in the liquid crystal to begin twisting.

Intermolecular forces between rod-like liquid crystal molecules mean that they usually all point in the same direction. If some begin twisting, this sets off a domino effect: the molecules reorient themselves in a complex interaction that moves across the sample like a Mexican wave. 

From this soup of molecules arise stable twisted formations that behave like particles. These particles interact with each other to create observable ripples. “We were surprised and excited to see that such time crystalline order can be readily observed in soft matter systems,” says Ivan Smalyukh, a physicist at the University of Colorado Boulder, who led the work.

To observe the molecular dance in detail, the authors looked at the time-crystal system using a kind of microscope that transmits only polarized light. The amount of light that passes through depends on a molecule's alignment, revealing the time crystal's ripples as a series of dark and bright stripes.

A Noble Madness: The Dark Side of Collecting from Antiquity to Now James Delbourgo Riverrun (2025)

The Galileo Museum, a science museum in Florence, Italy, has astronomer Galileo Galilei's preserved middle finger on display. Encased in a gilded glass egg, the digit is exhibited “as if it were the relic of a Christian saint”, remarks historian of science James Delbourgo in his illuminating and entertaining history of the ‘dark side' of humanity's obsession with collecting things. The finger was severed from Galileo's corpse in 1737 — long after his death in 1642 — along with an index finger also displayed at the museum and a vertebra held at the University of Padua, Italy. According to a witness to the dismemberment, the Italian nobleman who took the fingers desired them “because Galileo wrote so many beautiful things with them”.

It is an unusual story, but perhaps not entirely atypical. As Delbourgo shows in A Noble Madness, a large driver of the desire to collect artefacts is curiosity — whether scientific, historical, religious or otherwise. But perhaps even more often, it is obsession. Delbourgo focuses on this compulsive aspect, and the varying ways in which society has regarded people who are driven to amass stuff. He offers “a grand portrait gallery that charts the changing image of the collector from the ancient looter and medieval idolater to the decadent of the fin de siècle and the modern-day hoarder”.

A compelling example of such obsession is Henry Wellcome. He is known today through the biomedical research-funding organization Wellcome, and the Wellcome Collection museum and library in London. Born in 1853 to an itinerant missionary father in a log cabin in Wisconsin, by his death in 1936, Wellcome had become a highly successful pharmaceutical entrepreneur in the United Kingdom. He also owned a grotesquely overwhelming collection of objects, the variety and sheer number of which the world had never seen — mainly because few were on display.

Wellcome obtained many of these objects through highly dubious means, notes Frances Larson in her disturbing 2009 history of his collection, An Infinity of Things. In 1912, for example, Wellcome's right-hand man wrote to an agent in India, a doctor, that the country must be “completely ransacked as far as we possibly can for literature and other objects of interest connected with ancient medicine”. The agent duly did his best — but there is little evidence that Wellcome ever studied or ‘enjoyed' what had been collected. He was always too busy acquiring new things, right up to his death. His obsession was rooted in possession.

The Wellcome Museum deliberately avoids displaying information about its founder, notes Delbourgo. He regards this stance as “myopic: the Wellcome's abdication of its duty to educate visitors about its origins denies the public the chance to make up its own mind about its past”.

The British Museum, just down the road in London, is less coy about the man who provided its founding collection in 1753. Physician and naturalist Hans Sloane — the subject of Delbourgo's 2017 book Collecting the World — was an avid collector of curiosities and animal and plant specimens. His motivations were multifarious. He collected manuscripts from astrologers and alchemists to document their ascientific convictions as “disorders of the mind”, delusions that he felt might be cured by bloodletting, his specialism. But when it came to collecting from the natural world, he was explicit about a financial incentive: to “figure out what species were good for, what they cost, and how to make money off them”, in Delbourgo's words. To his critics, Sloane was an “ignorant arriviste”. Today, his financial links to the slave plantations in Jamaica that part-funded his collecting are openly acknowledged in an exhibit showing a bust of Sloane.

The publishing company behind USA Today and 220 other publications is today rolling out a chatbot-like tool called DeeperDive that can converse with readers, summarize insights from its journalism, and suggest new content from across its sites.

“Visitors now have a trusted AI answer engine on our platform for anything they want to engage with, anything they want to ask,” said Mike Reed, CEO of Gannett and the USA Today Network, at the WIRED AI Power Summit in New York, an event that brought together voices from the tech industry, politics, and the world of media, “and it is performing really great.”

Most publishers have a fraught relationship with AI, as the chatbots that trained on their content are now summarizing it and eating the traffic that search engines used to send them.

Reed said that Google's AI Overview feature has dramatically cut traffic to publishers across the industry. “We are watching the same movie as everyone else is watching,” Reed said ahead of today's announcement. “We can see some risk in the future to any content distribution model that is based primarily on SEO optimization.”

Like other publishers, Gannett has signed some deals with AI companies, including Amazon and Perplexity, to license its content. The company actively blocks the web scrapers that crawl websites in order to steal content.

DeeperDive represents a bet that harnessing the same generative artificial intelligence technology could help publishers capture readers attention by engaging with them in new ways.

The tool replaces a conventional search box and automatically suggests questions that readers might want to ask. For example, today it offers as one prompt, “How does Trump's Fed policy affect the economy?”

DeeperDive generates a short answer to the query along with relevant stories from across the USA Today network. Reed says it is crucial that DeeperDive bases its output on factually correct information and does not draw from opinion pieces. “We only look at our real journalism,” he says.

Reed adds that his company hopes that the tool will also reveal more about readers' interests. “That can help us from a revenue standpoint,” he said.

DeeperDive was developed by the advertising company Taboola. Adam Singolda, Taboola's CEO, says his firm developed DeeperDive by fine-tuning several open source models.

Singolda says DeeperDive benefits from data gathered from across its own network of more than 600 million daily readers across around 11,000 publishers. He says the tool “grounds every answer in articles retrieved from our publisher partners and requires sentence-level citations to those sources” and will avoid generating an output if information from two sources seems to conflict.

Gannett's CEO Reed said ahead of today's event that, together with Taboola, his firm is interested in exploring agentic tools for readers' shopping decisions. “Our audiences have a higher intent to purchase to begin with,” he says. “That's really the next step here.”

OpenAI appears to be ramping up its efforts in robotics, hiring researchers who work on humanoid systems as it explores new ways to advance artificial intelligence.

The company has recently recruited a number of researchers with expertise in developing AI algorithms for controlling humanoid and other types of robots. Job listings show that the company is putting together a team capable of creating systems that can be trained through teleoperation and simulation.

Sources with knowledge of the company's efforts also say OpenAI is recruiting people to work specifically on humanoid robots, or robots with a partial or full human form. One source who works in cutting-edge robotics says the company has begun training AI algorithms that are better able to make sense of the physical world and that could empower robots to navigate and perform tasks.

A number of recent hires suggest that OpenAI's robot efforts are now accelerating. For instance, Chengshu Li joined OpenAI in June 2025 from Stanford University, where he worked on a number of robotics projects, including the development of a benchmark designed to measure the abilities of humanoid robots capable of performing a wide range of household chores. Li's dissertation concerns the development of benchmarks and focuses on robots with a partly humanoid form, which has two arms but wheels instead of legs.

Two other researchers from another robotics lab have already joined the company according to their LinkedIn profiles. One professor at a third robotics lab that does humanoid work says one of their students was also recently recruited.

OpenAI declined to comment on its recruitment efforts or robot research plans. However, OpenAI has recently posted a number of revealing job listings related to robotics research on its site. One opening requires expertise in teleoperation and simulation. Teleoperation is a crucial part of training partial or fully humanoid robots: A human operator performs chores and controls the limbs of the robot, while an algorithm learns how to mimic their actions. The role also calls for expertise in simulation tools including Nvidia Isaac, which is widely used to train humanoids by having an algorithm learning inside a virtual physical environment.

It remains unclear whether OpenAI intends to build its own robots, use off-the-shelf hardware, or partner with a robotics company. However, another job posted in the past few weeks called for a mechanical engineer with expertise in prototyping and building robot systems with sensors for touch and motion. One roboticist says this could mean that OpenAI plans to build its own robot or that it is developing teleoperation systems for robot training. The job also calls for “experience designing mechanical systems intended for high volume (1M+), problem-solving on assembly lines,” which suggests systems that would be mass-produced or that might even be deployed in manufacturing.

All of OpenAI's robot job openings say that the company's robotics team “is focused on unlocking general-purpose robotics and pushing towards AGI-level intelligence in dynamic, real-world settings.”

A renewed focus on robots would suggest that OpenAI believes reaching artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI that exceeds human intelligence—may require developing algorithms that are capable of interacting with the physical world.

OpenAI did notable robotics research in its early years, including developing an algorithm capable of solving a Rubik's cube using a humanlike hand in 2019. The company shuttered its robotics effort in 2021, however, to focus on algorithms including the large language models that have driven recent breakthroughs such as ChatGPT. OpenAI restarted work on robots last year, and The Information reported in December 2024 that the company was considering developing its own humanoid robots.

Stefanie Tellex, a roboticist at Brown University, says that building more effective robots will involve designing and training AI models capable of “processing high-frame-rate, high-dimensional perceptual input, and producing high-frame-rate, high-dimensional physical outputs”—meaning models that can see and act with high fidelity. Tellex is not familiar with OpenAI's plans specifically, however.

Despite already having industry-leading models for conversation, reasoning, coding, and image and video generation, OpenAI will be racing a series of strong competitors as it seeks to develop the algorithms for more capable humanoid robots. A handful of humanoid startups, including Figure, Agility, and Apptronik, have emerged over the past few years, and some major AI companies, including Tesla and Google, are also investing in developing and testing humanoids. “I don't see them having any magical advantage over anyone else,” says Tellex.

Humanoids are becoming increasingly popular as the hardware and software needed to build functioning prototypes becomes more common. While humanoids are still expensive and difficult to develop, new kinds of motors and other components have made it cheaper and easier to put together functioning systems. Software such as Nvidia's Isaac robot development platform have also made it simpler to write the code needed to control and train humanoid systems.

Humanoid hype is also building. Venture capitalists have invested more than $5 billion in humanoid startups since the start of 2024. Morgan Stanley reckons that the humanoid industry could be worth $5 trillion by 2050.

While humanoids can perform impressive feats like dancing, they still lack the intelligence required to operate in complex and unpredictable, or “unstructured,” environments. To acquire this, they will need algorithms that go beyond a large language model's understanding of the physical world. These systems must be able to control limbs and grippers in order to walk and manipulate physical items. Some research groups are starting to demonstrate progress in developing more generally capable AI models for robots.

At the same time, it is becoming increasingly clear that new ideas may be needed to push AI forward. The recent disappointment of OpenAI's GPT-5 is part of a broader realization that reaching humanlike intelligence will require new avenues of research.

“They've asymptoted on GPT-5,” says Tellex. “They need to move towards the physical world.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Next Era of Gene Editing Will Be Disease Agnostic","https://www.wired.com/story/the-next-era-of-gene-editing-will-be-disease-agnostic/","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 09:30:00 GMT","

At the WIRED Health summit last week, Harvard biochemist and gene-editing pioneer David Liu said that later this year his lab plans to report on a single gene-editing strategy that could treat many unrelated diseases. He calls it disease-agnostic therapeutic gene editing.

“It sounds sort of crazy, but there's actually a very good molecular biology reason why this could be possible,” he told the audience in Boston, stopping short of details.

Gene-editing treatments are currently being developed for several rare and inherited genetic diseases. One gene-editing treatment, called Casgevy, is approved and available commercially to treat sickle cell disease and a related blood disorder called beta thalassemia. Earlier this year, KJ Muldoon, a baby boy born with an often fatal genetic disease that causes ammonia to build up in his blood, was saved with a customized gene-editing treatment—a medical first.

These treatments work by targeting specific mutations related to those diseases. But they can be costly to develop and must be designed for specific patient populations. Sometimes those patient populations can be very small, as in the case of baby KJ. His condition, called CPS1 deficiency, affects just one in 1.3 million live births.

Liu envisions a future in which one gene-editing approach could be used on multiple different diseases, regardless of what organ or tissue they affect or their genetic cause. He says this kind of streamlined strategy is needed because collectively, there are so many rare diseases, and it would be impractical to design treatments for each one. Global Genes, a rare disease advocacy organization, estimates that there are at least 10,000 rare diseases that affect more than 400 million people worldwide.

“Genetic disease as a whole is not so rare. It's actually many times more prevalent than cancer or HIV/AIDS,” Liu said. “We urgently need these ways to directly treat the root cause of these genetic diseases.”

Liu's lab has developed two such ways to tackle rare diseases: base editing and prime editing. These next-generation versions of Crispr are already being used in around two dozen clinical trials around the world.

Base editing involves lab-made proteins that can change one DNA base, or “letter,” in a DNA sequence to another, such as changing a C to a T. They are akin to pencils that can correct single-letter misspellings. Baby KJ's treatment used a base editor to treat his disease.

Prime editing, meanwhile, functions like a search-and-replace system for DNA. While traditional Crispr gene editing creates a double-stranded break in the DNA, prime editing allows for precise additions, deletions, or swaps without making that break. A prime editor, he explained, synthesizes a new segment of DNA and orchestrates repair processes in the cell, so that that new piece of DNA replaces the original sequence. Essentially, it's a DNA word processor.

At WIRED Health, Liu teased that his lab has found a way to use prime editing in a disease-agnostic manner.

“Taking advantage of the ability of prime editing to do search-and-replace gene editing raises the possibility that a single composition of matter—potentially, a single drug—might benefit many, many more patients than going after diseases one mutation at a time,” Liu said. “That kind of future for gene editing, I think, will amplify, many-fold its impact and, most importantly, its access to the patients who need these treatments.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","MAHA Wants Action on Pesticides. It's Not Going to Get It From Trump's Corporate-Friendly EPA","https://www.wired.com/story/the-epas-closeness-to-industry-stands-in-the-way-of-it-helping-maha/","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

When Jean-Marie Kauth first read the Make America Healthy Again commission report, released by the White House in May, she was “thrilled about some of the things they identified,” she says. “They clearly called out industry as a pernicious influence on why EPA has not been very successful in regulating chemicals, especially pesticides.”

Kauth's daughter died of leukemia at age 8 after, Kauth says, she was exposed to the insecticide chlorpyrifos, which the EPA banned in 2021. (That ban was overturned by a court order in 2023.) Kauth, a professor at Benedictine University in Illinois, now serves as a member of the EPA's Children's Health Protection Advisory Committee (CHPAC), a group of outside experts who advise the agency on children's health issues.

In late August, the committee met to discuss a new document: a draft strategy road map written as a follow-up to the May MAHA report, intended to execute its agenda. But Kauth's optimism about parts of MAHA's potential mission was undercut when EPA leadership—some of whom previously worked for and with the chemical and agricultural industries—had few answers for CHPAC about how the agency's numerous recent regulatory rollbacks around chemicals would help to protect children's health.

“By what mechanism are they going to actually accomplish anything when they've rolled back the meager protections we had at EPA?” Kauth says.

The final MAHA strategy report, with input from multiple agencies, was released from the White House on Tuesday. Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, said in a statement that the strategy outlined in the document would “ensure our kids and our environment are protected.” But critics—including some in the MAHA movement—are questioning how the EPA can truly protect public health when it is so friendly to corporate interests.

Zen Honeycutt is the executive director of Moms Across America, a grassroots advocacy group at the core of the MAHA movement. (Robert F. Kennedy, Jr is on the board of advisers.) Honeycutt says she has been overall “very encouraged by the collaborative initiatives of this administration to welcome bipartisan experts.” But she had harsh criticisms for how the new strategy document handled the issue of pesticides. The new report, she says, is “blatant pandering to the pesticide companies.”

The May MAHA commission report called out two popular pesticides—glyphosate and atrazine—by name as potentially harmful to human health. (As other outlets have asserted that the report possibly used AI to create false research, WIRED checked the footnotes in the sections on these two chemicals; all of the studies cited exist.) While multiple international bodies, including the EPA, have deemed these pesticides safe for use, some research has linked exposure to these chemicals to a variety of health issues, including cancer.

The MAHA movement has largely united around the need to keep pesticides out of the food supply, with many, including Honeycutt, naming these two pesticides as a particular problem. RFK Jr, the MAHA movement's leader and current secretary of health and human services, has a long history with glyphosate in particular. In 2018, Kennedy was part of a team of lawyers who successfully won a suit against agribusiness giant Monsanto on behalf of a terminally ill man who claimed exposure to Roundup, a weed killer whose main ingredient is glyphosate, caused his cancer.

The May report garnered criticism from multiple industry groups, including powerful farmers' and growers' groups, who called out the inclusion of pesticides in the report. The White House invited nearly 50 farm and food groups to discuss the report over the summer.

The new strategy report, released this week, steps back from its previous explicit takes on pesticides by not mentioning glyphosate and atrazine by name, and only makes a few mentions of concrete actions on pesticides. The report says that the EPA will “work to ensure that the public has awareness and confidence in EPA's pesticide robust review procedures”—a promise that doesn't pass muster with Honeycutt.

“A few words on a website explaining the pesticide review process to the American people is not going to reduce my children's allergies, or their autoimmune issues, or their mental health issues,” Honeycutt says. “The only thing that would reduce our children's chronic health issues and mental health issues would be if they reduced the exposure to our children of those pesticides.”

Honeycutt's critiques are echoed by David Murphy, who worked on Kennedy's presidential campaign. He called the strategy report “a major missed opportunity for the Trump administration,” telling Politico that “the pesticide industry are firmly embedded in the White House and intentionally short-circuiting Trump's campaign promise to the millions of MAHA voters who helped him return to power.” (“The Trump administration is committed to continuing to work with our stakeholders to deliver more MAHA wins for the American people,” White House spokesman Kush Desai told WIRED.)

The final report may actually signal the opposite of what MAHA wants. Under a section titled “Process Efficiencies and Deregulation,” the strategy document says that the agency will “work to reform the approval process” for both chemical and biological pesticides. However, Zeldin has said that under his supervision, the agency has new “expedited review processes” for pesticides and chemicals.

“It looks like they're actually trying to speed up the approval process,” says Betsy Southerland, a 33-year veteran of the EPA who became a whistleblower during the first Trump administration. “But that's not what MAHA supporters were thinking they were going to do. They were thinking they were actually going to do more health protection through the review of these pesticides, not just speed it up and put more ones out there.”

The EPA did not respond to a question as to whether or not it intends to initiate new reforms based on the MAHA agenda, and directed questions on the strategy document to the Department of Health and Human Services and the White House. HHS did not reply to specific questions about the strategy. “HHS is advancing bold reforms to make America healthy again,” HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon told WIRED. “We won't be swayed by partisan critics. Our focus is on transparency, science, and delivering results for the American people.”

Three of the key people currently leading the EPA's chemical work have extensive ties to the chemicals and pesticides industry. The New York Times reported in May that the leader of the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, Nancy Beck, pushed behind the scenes to exclude pesticides from the original MAHA commission report.

“President Trump made a fantastic choice in selecting Dr. Beck, who has never been a lobbyist in her life, by the way—no lamestream media outlet has reported that correctly,” EPA press secretary Bridget Hirsch told WIRED in a statement. Beck and her colleagues, Hirsch said, “remain committed to being led by the science, unlike Biden EPA appointees with major ethical issues that were beholden to radical groups.”

Zeldin's public calendar shows that he has met at least six times over the past seven months with chemical and plastics companies and lobbying groups—including a meeting in June with Bayer AG, which bought Monsanto in 2018.

“It's a disservice to your readers to cherry-pick six of Administrator Zeldin's many meetings over the last nine months from his very full calendar to paint an inaccurate picture and bolster your false narrative,” Hirsch said. “Administrator Zeldin is committed to protecting human health and the environment 100 percent—any implication otherwise is your opinion and nothing more.”

Brian Leake, the director of external communications for Bayer, said in an email that the company was “pleased to see feedback provided by the agriculture industry—in particular, farmers—was solicited and received by the commission, helping inform the report.

“Bayer stands behind the safety of our glyphosate-based products, which have been tested extensively, approved by regulators, and used around the globe for 50 years,” Leake said. “The EPA has an extremely rigorous review process which spans multiple years, considers thousands of studies, and involves many independent risk assessment experts at the EPA.”

As of May, 3,000 employees had already left the agency. That month, EPA leadership announced its intent to dissolve the Office of Research and Development, its independent scientific arm that employed more than 1,000 scientists at the start of the year, redistributing some to other areas of the agency while laying others off. That reorganization began in July. (Hirsch said that the reorganization will “improve the effectiveness and efficiency of EPA operations and align core statutory requirements with its organizational structure.”)

These crises, employees say, may be affecting the agency's work with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), colloquially called forever chemicals, which are another area of concern for the MAHA movement. A growing body of research has linked these chemicals, which don't degrade in the environment, to a variety of health concerns. The strategy document released this week says that the EPA and National Institutes of Health will help the CDC “update recommendations” regarding the health risks of PFAS in water.

It's unclear how robust such a review will be. In 2024, the Biden administration put limits on six PFAS chemicals in drinking water. In May, the EPA announced that it would be reconsidering limits on four of those.

Two EPA employees working on PFAS issues told WIRED that thanks to shake-ups at the agency, they are struggling to procure supplies, hire lab techs, and do their work. These employees spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to speak to the press. (“We are confident EPA has the resources needed to accomplish the agency's core mission of protecting human health and the environment, fulfill all statutory obligations, and make the best-informed decisions based on the gold standard of science,” Hirsch, the EPA press secretary, told WIRED.)

“I've been here for several years,” one employee told WIRED. “It is the least productive period for me, including Covid, and it seems like everyone else is in the same boat.”

Earlier this summer, I found myself lying flat on a padded table in Tucson, Arizona. A mechanical arm hovered above me, scanning my body from head to toe while I tried to remain still. Fifteen-ish minutes later, a clinician handed me a thick packet of results, which included details on bone density, lean muscle mass, body fat percentage, and color-coded visuals showing exactly where each of these metrics was located within my body.

This was a DEXA scan, short for dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Since the late 1980s, hospitals have used this method to diagnose osteoporosis, and it remains the gold-standard test for bone health. In recent years, however, it has been rebranded as a wellness service, promoted by longevity influencers like Peter Attia and Bryan Johnson, and is now offered at boutique clinics and luxury retreats. At Canyon Ranch, where I was attending the Longevity8 program, the DEXA scan was presented as a crucial snapshot of what might be diminishing my healthspan.

The appeal of the DEXA scan is clear. In a culture that is obsessed with optimization and biometric data, these scans promise hard numbers. But does all this information genuinely help you live longer, or does it simply provide expensive figures to obsess over?

DEXA BD (bone density) scans were introduced into clinical practice in 1987 for measuring bone mineral density in the spine and hip. Current medical guidelines recommend that women over the age of 65, as well as younger women with risk factors, should be screened for osteoporosis. Though by this age, it's often too late.

“We suggest earlier screening, especially during periomenopause, when women can lose up to 20 percent of their bone mass,” says Jennifer Wagner, chief health and performance officer at Canyon Ranch.

According to Wagner, the risks of osteoporotic fractures are high. “One in three women will experience one, and half of those have significant complications,” she says. “Prevention ideally starts 20 to 30 years before fracture risk peaks.”

What catapulted DEXA into the wellness world is its ability to measure more than bone. A DEXA BC (body composition) scan can also distinguish fat from lean muscle, providing a clearer picture of cardiovascular risk, metabolic health, and stroke risk.

“It gives a greater understanding of where fat is located, how much there is, and adds to our ability to stratify risk,” explains Josh Cheema, medical director of Northwestern Medicine's Human Longevity Clinic. “It hasn't made it into screening guidelines, but it's important. The most common way we currently screen for obesity is BMI, but BMI can be misleading, especially for people with high muscle mass, athletes, or younger individuals.”

DEXA also measures visceral adipose tissue, which is the inflammatory fat around the internal organs. According to internist and performance specialist Pooja Gidwani, high visceral fat increases insulin resistance and chronic disease risk. “Visceral fat is one of the most important metrics,” she says. “Knowing these numbers guides how you eat, exercise, and whether you need medications.”

The granularity of DEXA is compelling for athletes, but it's also increasingly popular with people on GLP-1 medications like Ozempic or Mounjaro. These drugs accelerate fat loss but can also erode muscle and bone density. “DEXA helps us see the quality of weight loss, how much is fat versus muscle,” Gidwani says.

Gidwani likens the scan to a financial audit: “Muscle and bone are your assets; fat is your liability.” Wagner offers a gentler take: “Think of it like a savings account,” she says. “Knowing your starting balance helps you plan before decline sets in.”

In hospitals, bone density scans may be covered by insurance if you meet the osteoporosis screening criteria. At luxury retreats like Canyon Ranch, they're bundled into a $20,000 program fee. Stand-alone scans typically run $300 or more, though some university labs sometimes offer cheaper options for research volunteers.

The bigger cost is the repetition. Experts agree that the value lies in tracking trends over time. “For patients on a fitness or body recomposition journey, I recommend repeating a DEXA every one to three months,” Gidwani says.

For most people, though, “if results are strong, maybe you don't need another scan for five years,” says Wagner. “If they're lower, lifestyle interventions can help, and you may want to recheck in a year.”

Radiation exposure is negligible, less than a chest x-ray. But the psychological impact can be more complicated. For some, the numbers motivate: “When I did a body composition test at 36, I had way more body fat than I expected,” Cheema says. “That pushed me to change my workouts and eating patterns in ways that improved my health—something BMI alone wouldn't have prompted.”

For others, especially those with histories of disordered eating or body image issues, it can be destabilizing and overwhelming. Numbers can become another metric to obsess over rather than a tool for health. “It can be overwhelming if you don't have a clinician to interpret the results,” Gidwani says. “That's why I review all of my patients' scans with them.”

Cheema agrees: “Too much detail without guidance risks overwhelming people with information that isn't clinically actionable.”

“I don't think DEXA gives too much information compared to, say, a whole-body MRI, which can reveal incidental findings that can cause anxiety and lead to unnecessary interventions,” says Gidwani. “Its data points are actionable: decrease body fat, reduce visceral fat, increase muscle.”

Experts emphasize that actionability is key. “The most important metrics are visceral adipose tissue and total body fat percentage, especially when tracked over time,” Cheema says. “But DEXA also breaks things down by arms, legs, trunk, etc. That can veer into aesthetics rather than health.

If you're 65 or older, or at risk for osteoporosis, your doctor may already recommend a DEXA scan for bone health. For women in perimenopause, when bone density can drop by as much as 20 percent, an early baseline scan could flag risks years before they become urgent.

DEXA also detects sarcopenic obesity, where muscle loss occurs alongside high body fat. “Someone may look normal weight on a scale, but a DEXA can reveal poor muscle-to-fat balance,” Gidwani says.

Beyond those groups, the use case narrows. Athletes, bodybuilders, and people on GLP-1 medications may find the data genuinely useful. For generally healthy adults who exercise, eat decently, and check in with a doctor, many clinicians are indifferent.

“For a healthy individual, I wouldn't universally recommend it,” Cheema says. “Lifestyle changes and basic care may matter more than getting a DEXA.” There are alternatives—bioimpedance scales, Bod Pods, and AI-enabled wearables—but none are as accurate as DEXA. For now, it remains the most precise, if expensive, tool available.

My DEXA results were somewhat humbling. Despite near-daily workouts and a decent diet, the scan flagged more body fat than I expected and the beginnings of osteopenia in my spine. The bright side was an “excellent” visceral fat score, something I'll be bragging about indefinitely.

Catching early bone loss feels actionable; I can tweak my workouts to prioritize strength and mobility. But the body fat percentages have lived in my brain rent-free ever since, without offering much in return. I don't plan to shell out a few hundred dollars for another scan anytime soon, so I may never know if my adjustments are actually working.

That's the paradox of DEXA. For those with medical risks, it can be invaluable. For athletes chasing marginal gains, it's another knob to turn. But for the rest of us, it's a reminder that data is only as useful as what you're willing or able to do with it. In the end, DEXA doesn't promise longevity so much as it promises numbers, and numbers alone don't add years to your life.

At the WIRED Health summit in Boston on September 9, we hosted some of the leading experts in CRISPR, whole-genome sequencing, vaccines, and more for a series of eye-opening conversations and keynotes. If you weren't able to join us in person, no worries; you can watch them all right here.

From 2025 Breakthrough Prize winner David Liu to Moderna CEO Stepháne Bancel, WIRED Health speakers gave deep insights into what's next for gene-editing, cancer treatment, and a host of other cutting-edge topics. We were also joined by neurosurgeon and CNN chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta, who discussed chronic pain and his new book, It Doesn't Have to Hurt: Your Smart Guide to a Pain-Free Life.

The next WIRED Health event will take place April 17 in London. In the meantime, get caught up on our Boston summit below.

Treatment for genetic diseases like sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia are hard to design, but ongoing CRISPR clinical trials offer new hope for patients. WIRED managing editor Hemal Jhaveri spoke with 2025 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences winner David Liu to discuss how new genetic-editing tools can fix the pathogenic gene mutations that cause thousands of diseases.

In the past two decades, MIT neuroscientist Ed Boyden has invented novel tools to map and control the brain. Now, he's building the world's first computer simulation of one. In this WIRED Health keynote, he spoke about how that invention can revolutionize AI, unlock new treatments for neurodiseases, and even help better understand the human condition.

From digital brain training to at-home screening devices, technology is transforming how and where people 50 and over live while managing conditions like dementia and chronic diseases. AARP CEO Myechia Minter-Jordan spoke with WIRED executive editor Brian Barrett about the promise of AgeTech, the booming longevity economy, and how startups are innovating to help us thrive as we age.

Nationwide whole-genome sequencing projects are being launched by governments around the world, from the United Kingdom to the United Arab Emirates. Harvard geneticist George Church and Orchid founder and CEO Noor Siddiqui spoke with WIRED staff writer Emily Mullin about how whole-genome sequencing is being used to prevent genetic diseases.

In this keynote, former Google and Facebook technical executive Mary Lou Jepsen—now chairman and founder of Openwater—shared an exclusive preview of her new invention: a portable modular device designed to combine ultrasound, holography, and cutting-edge physics to kill cancer tumors and other diseases with precision.

Cancer care still relies on slow, expensive procedures developed decades ago. Liquid biopsies are changing that—replacing CT scans and surgical biopsies with a single blood test that can detect cancers at an early stage and accelerate treatments. The cofounder and CEO of Guardant Health, Helmy Eltoukhy, sat down with WIRED Health curator João Medeiros to discuss how precision oncology is reshaping the cancer patient experience, and how liquid biopsies will soon be part of routine health care.

What's next for the company that developed a Covid-19 mRNA vaccine in record time? Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel spoke with WIRED's Brian Barrett about the biotech company's exciting work on individualized mRNA cancer therapies and other promising cancer treatments under development. Bancel also responded to the Trump administration's recent anti-mRNA rhetoric.

More than 52 million people worldwide suffer from daily chronic pain. CNN chief medical correspondent and Emmy Award-winning neurosurgeon Sanjay Gupta joined WIRED Health curator João Medeiros to talk about his new book and the best science-backed methods to treat pain.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","Project Orbion: Seeing the World Through a Crystal Ball","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/project-orbion-seeing-the-world-through-a-crystal-ball-179913.html","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 12:01:49 GMT","

There are moments in the history of technology that feel less like innovation and more like the arrival of magic. The first time a human voice traveled across a wire, the first time images flickered across a screen — these were feats that blurred the line between science and sorcery. Today, we stand at the precipice of another.

A coalition of companies led by simulation powerhouse Aechelon Technology is building something that was once the exclusive domain of fantasy: a real-time, all-seeing, perfectly accurate digital twin of our entire planet.

It's called Project Orbion, and it functions like a technological crystal ball, offering a form of clairvoyance that promises to reshape everything from national defense to disaster relief. This isn't just an advancement; it's the closest humanity has ever come to wielding true magic.

Let's talk technological magic this week. Then we'll close with my Product of the Week: a dietary supplement that I believe could extend your life and assure your health.

To understand the spell Project Orbion is casting, one must first understand the concept of “synthetic reality.” Born from the legendary DNA of Silicon Graphics, Aechelon Technology has long been a quiet giant in the world of high-fidelity simulation, particularly for defense clients. It pioneered a discipline that goes far beyond what most of us know as virtual reality.

It's crucial to distinguish between the different forms of manufactured perception:

Virtual reality (VR) creates a completely computer-generated world, immersing the user in an environment that has no connection to their physical surroundings. It's best suited for gaming or training in controlled, hypothetical scenarios.

Augmented reality (AR), by contrast, overlays digital information onto our real world, like the navigational arrows you might see in a car's heads-up display.

Extended reality (XR) is simply the umbrella term that covers them all.

Synthetic reality, however, is a far more demanding discipline. It is not an imagined world, but a perfect, physics-accurate, photorealistic re-creation of the real world, updated in real-time. It's a living, breathing digital doppelgänger.

The standard for accuracy is absolute. Consider the training mission depicted in the film “Top Gun: Maverick.” The pilots rehearsed their daring run in a simulation of the target environment. But that simulation was static. As the movie illustrated, if a single real-world variable had changed — a new missile emplacement, a different patrol pattern — the mission would have ended in disaster.

Synthetic reality solves this by providing a training and planning environment that reflects the target as it is right now, dramatically reducing the chances of failure in high-stakes operations.

A magical feat of this magnitude cannot be accomplished by a single sorcerer. Project Orbion is a powerful alliance, an assembly of technological wizards each contributing a unique and vital ingredient to the spell.

At the heart of the project is a constellation of “all-seeing eyes” in the sky. Iceye, a Finnish defense and technology firm, provides a form of scrying that defies the laws of nature. Using a fleet of over 50 satellites equipped with synthetic aperture radar (SAR), they can peer through clouds, dense fog, thick foliage, and the darkest night.

Iceye's microwave radar pulses paint a startlingly accurate picture of the ground below, and its sophisticated AI can even classify the objects it sees, distinguishing a tank from a truck, for instance.

Complementing this is BlackSky, a company dedicated to delivering space-based intelligence at “the speed of life.” While Iceye penetrates, BlackSky observes. Its constellation of 13 satellites provides real-time, high-resolution optical imagery, constantly updating the visual state of the world.

A software-first company, BlackSky understands that its customers often don't want raw images; they want answers. BlackSky's analytics provide immediate insights, and it is pioneering satellite-to-satellite communication to slash the latency between observation and action to nearly zero.

This torrent of data from the heavens is then handed to Spatial, the master cartographer. Using advanced AI, Spatial reconstructs the world from the fused radar and optical data streams, building the foundational map of this new reality. Critically, it also acts as a magical compass.

GPS signals and digital compasses are notoriously unreliable in the dense concrete canyons of modern cities. Spatial's technology provides hyper-accurate location and directional awareness, a crucial capability for guiding rescue teams through a disaster zone or ensuring the pinpoint accuracy of a weapon system.

Finally, the vision is made manifest by Distance. This Finnish deep-tech company is focused on creating next-generation situational awareness through computational optics and 3D light field systems. Think of Distance's technology as the crystal ball itself. It creates true 3D visualizations that require no special glasses and is capable of integrating thermal, night vision, and IR sensor data into the display.

While currently cost-prohibitive for widespread consumer use, the technology is capable of turning the entire windshield of a car or cockpit of a jet into a seamless window into this synthetic world, overlaying the unseen directly onto the scene.

Aechelon is the arch-mage that gathers these powerful components and weaves them into a single, cohesive enchantment. The continuous flow of data from Iceye and BlackSky is fused and reconstructed by Spatial's AI. Aechelon then takes this ever-updating, hyper-accurate 3D model and renders it into a fully navigable 4D environment — the three dimensions of space, plus the fourth dimension of real-time updates.

This isn't theoretical.

An early proof-of-concept for the U.S. Coast Guard demonstrated the profound effectiveness of this approach. Trainees were able to conduct complex missions in a perfect digital replica of their operational area, experiencing the environment with a fidelity that was previously impossible.

This capability is now being scaled to a global level with Project Orbion. The same technology that can train a pilot to navigate a treacherous coastline can also be used to train an AI. A robot can learn to navigate the complexities of a real-world city far more effectively and safely within its perfect digital twin than it ever could through physical trial and error.

While its origins are deeply rooted in defense, the magic of Project Orbion has applications that will touch every facet of modern life:

Project Orbion is more than just a technological project; it is the dawn of a new kind of perception.

By fusing real-time satellite imagery, advanced AI reconstruction, and revolutionary display technology, Aechelon and its partners are creating a living, breathing digital copy of our world. It grants us a form of technological omniscience, the ability to see and understand our planet with a clarity and immediacy that was, until now, the stuff of myths and legends.

This is the magic of our time — not of wands and incantations, but of data and algorithms — and it holds the power to help us solve some of the most complex challenges we face, turning fantasy into a synthetic reality.



Sometimes you stumble upon a game-changing product completely by accident. I was recently on a panel where a fellow panelist, an expert in innovation and marketing, mentioned a company that had turned a simple health supplement into a brilliant, data-driven service.

The company, Zinzino, offers a subscription product that combines at-home blood testing with a customized Omega-3 supplement. Intrigued, I looked into it, and I'm now convinced it's one of the most intelligent and effective approaches to personal health I've seen.

It's a system that moves beyond guesswork and provides verifiable proof that you are actively improving your health at a cellular level.

For decades, we've been told to take fish oil, but the conversation often stops there.

The real issue is the delicate balance between Omega-6 and Omega-3 fatty acids. Both are essential, but modern Western diets — rich in vegetable oils, grains, and processed foods — have skewed our intake dramatically in favor of pro-inflammatory Omega-6s. Scientific consensus suggests that for optimal health, our Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio should be close to 3:1.

The terrifying reality is that most Americans operate at a ratio of 15:1 or even higher, a state of chronic, low-grade inflammation that researchers now believe is a key driver of most modern chronic diseases, from heart disease to arthritis.

Achieving the correct balance helps protect cell membranes, supports brain and heart health, and is correlated with a longer, healthier life. The challenge is that you can't manage what you don't measure. Swallowing a random fish oil capsule from the drugstore gives you no insight into your personal ratio or whether the supplement is even working.

This is where Zinzino's approach is revolutionary. It is a Scandinavian wellness company that has built its flagship product, BalanceOil, around a rigorous, test-based protocol.



Image Credit: Zinzino

The process is simple: you receive an at-home dried blood spot test, prick your finger, and send the sample to an independent lab in Norway. About two weeks later, you receive a detailed, anonymous report on your body's Omega-6:3 ratio and other key fatty acid profiles.

Based on your results, you begin a subscription to Zinzino's BalanceOil — a high-quality, full-spectrum fish oil rich in polyphenols from olives, which protect the fragile Omega-3s from oxidation. After 120 days, the time it takes for your body's cells to regenerate, you take a second test. This closes the loop, providing concrete, scientific proof of whether the supplement has brought your body back into the healthy 3:1 balance.

There's also a compelling reason to trust a product like this from a Scandinavian company over a domestic one. The U.S. supplement market is notoriously under-regulated, operating under a 1994 law that essentially allows companies to sell products without proving their efficacy or purity beforehand.

In contrast, European and particularly Nordic countries have far stricter regulations regarding food supplements and contaminants. Zinzino's oil is sourced from wild-caught, small fish to minimize heavy metal exposure and undergoes rigorous third-party testing for purity, ensuring you're getting a safe and potent product.

Zinzino's system isn't just a product; it's a personalized wellness service that provides accountability. It forces both the company and the consumer to prove that the intervention is working. The initial test provides the baseline truth, and the second test delivers the verdict. It replaces hope with data. It's this commitment to verifiable results that my fellow panelist saw as a marketing masterstroke, and it's why I see it as a powerful new paradigm for managing our own health.

Now that I know of Zinzino's approach, I think that taking any supplement should come with two tests: one that tells you how bad you are and a second one that tells you whether the supplement is working. I wonder why we don't do this with all supplements, given that many don't work or are not needed.

The fact that Zinzino actually works and could not only help me live longer but also allow me to keep more of my hair makes it my Product of the Week.

— Ravi Soin has joined Smartsheet as chief information security officer. Soin was previously at Edifecs, where he served on the Bellevue, Wash., company's leadership team for more than 14 years. Soin's background also includes nearly a decade at Microsoft, where he was group program manager for Bing social initiatives.

“As we continue to scale and expand our AI capabilities, Ravi's leadership will be instrumental in reinforcing our commitment to security excellence and delivering a trusted enterprise experience for our global customers,” said Cynthia Tee, Smartsheet's chief technology officer, in a statement. 

Smartsheet, an enterprise software giant also based in Bellevue, turned private again in January in an $8.4 billion deal.

— After nearly 16 years with Amazon, attorney Mark Hoffman has left the company. Hoffman most recently held the title of vice president and associate general council of corporate and securities and head of legal operations. Hoffman began his career at Riddell Williams and was partner at both Gray Cary and DLA Piper before joining Amazon.

Hoffman said at Amazon he was “fortunate to have found such a wonderful group of smart, dedicated, creative, fun, and honorable people with whom to work.”

“Onward to travel, family time, board service, obscure hobbies, and all that the next chapter brings,” he added.

— Former Carbon CEO Derek Tu joined Stacklok as director of product management. The Seattle startup is developing AI assistants, agents and models.

“We're building a centralized control plane that gives security and IT leaders full visibility and governance over how agents access data and invoke tools — unlocking safe, scalable AI adoption in the enterprise,” Tu said on LinkedIn. 

Tu co-founded Carbon in 2022, and the startup was acquired by OpenAI rival Perplexity in December. Tu was previously a tech leader and early employee at Los Angeles e-commerce company Italic, and held product roles at Wayfair, Flywire and 6sense.

— Seattle-area tech leader Himanshu Tayal is now resident expert at AI House, a city hub supporting artificial intelligence startups and the AI sector. The role is part of Allen Institute for AI (Ai2), a nonprofit organization of roughly 225 people that includes some of the field's top researchers.

Tayal previously worked at Amazon Web Services in generative AI, and was at Microsoft and Amazon.

— Joseph Sunga was promoted to director of product management at Waabi, a Toronto-based autonomous vehicle startup with a cohort of Seattle engineers. Sunga's past roles include management positions at multiple Seattle companies including Aura, Mighty AI, Amazon and TeachStreet.

— Sarah Bell is now pipeline and portfolio lead for E8 Angels, a Seattle-based, climate-focused investment organization. Prior to her new role, Bell was an operating partner and chief of staff at LeapSheep for nine years, helping startup founders navigate business development challenges.

“[Bell] is passionate about accelerating the clean energy transition while expanding opportunities for both investors and entrepreneurs,” E8 posted on LinkedIn, noting her expertise in climate tech, agtech and space tech. 

— Christin Camacho left her role as vice president of marketing for Seattle's LevelTen Energy after nearly seven years with the company.

“We built awareness that there was a better, faster way to do deals with clean energy projects, helping LevelTen facilitate over $25 billion in clean energy transactions and over 150 [power purchase agreements] since 2018,” she said on LinkedIn. 

The startup, which runs an online marketplace facilitating clean energy projects, disclosed in August that it was laying off 60 employees. Camacho is looking for a role in clean energy, corporate sustainability, regenerative agriculture or social impact.

— Nori co-founder Ross Kenyon is executive in residence at Washington Maritime Blue, an organization supporting the maritime sector and sustainability. Kenyon helped launch Seattle's Nori in 2017, creating a marketplace for farmers to sell carbon removal credits for engaging in climate friendly agricultural practices. 

Nori closed last year after raising $17.25 million from investors. Kenyon has since worked with multiple organizations supporting climate tech startups and their founders.

Apple has officially absorbed the founding team of WhyLabs, the Seattle startup it acquired in a secretive deal. 

GeekWire first reported about the acquisition earlier this year.

Now the founders are working at Apple in various AI-related roles, according to LinkedIn.

The WhyLabs website is now updated with information about the company “discontinuing operations” and open-sourcing its platform.

Apple and WhyLabs execs haven't responded to our messages about the deal. 

The deal appears on a European Commission webpage that tracks tech acquisitions under the Digital Markets Act. “Apple will acquire the right to make employment offers to and hire certain Americas-based employees of WhyLabs and a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual and irrevocable license to use all WhyLabs' intellectual property,” according to the description of the deal.

The EU lists the deal as dated Jan. 24, noting that such acquisitions are typically published at least four months after notification. That suggests the WhyLabs acquisition came together in 2024.

WhyLabs built software to help companies monitor their AI applications for security and performance. It was part of a wave of AI observability tools that emerged alongside the rapid adoption of AI software.

The company joins a growing list of Seattle tech startups gobbled up by Apple. The Cupertino tech giant previously paid $200 million in 2020 to acquire Xnor, a Seattle startup that specialized in edge-based AI tools.

Apple also acquired Seattle-based machine learning startup Turi in 2016 and Union Bay Networks in 2014.

Apple has a substantial engineering hub in Seattle across multiple offices. Earlier this year it inked a big new lease in South Lake Union and currently has more than 200 open Seattle-based roles.

Apple has been seen as lagging behind rivals in the AI race. The company is working on an AI-powered search system slated to debut next year, according to Bloomberg, and has reportedly explored acquiring AI heavyweights including Perplexity and Mistral.

WhyLabs spun out of Seattle's Allen Institute for AI, the Seattle-based research institution that also housed Xnor. It was valued at $37 million following a $10 million Series A round in 2021, according to PitchBook. Investors included AI Fund; Defy Partners; Bezos Expeditions; Madrona; and Ascend.

Visnjic previously spent eight years at Amazon helping develop its machine learning infrastructure. Dang and Gracie were also former Amazon employees. Karaivanova was a former Cloudflare executive and principal at Madrona.

WhyLabs was ranked No. 81 on the GeekWire 200, our list of top privately held startups in the Pacific Northwest. It was a finalist for Startup of the Year at the GeekWire Awards in 2023.

PayPal is introducing a new way for people to send money to one another through peer-to-peer (p2p) payments made via personalized, one-time links. The system, called PayPal Links, complements the company's existing feature called PayPal Me, which will continue to exist as a way to share your profile information and make it easier to get found and paid.

The company explains that PayPal Me links are not payment requests tied to a specific amount — at least until the receiver inputs how much they plan to pay. 

PayPal Me links were only used to get paid. The new PayPal Links, however, allow customers to either request or make a payment to another person by selecting the link option, inputting the amount, and then copying the link into a conversation. This makes the feature more useful for one-time payments or requests directly with another person without needing to identify and verify their profile or account information. As a result, there are fewer steps involved, making the payments faster.

In addition, PayPal links will soon be able to support crypto in the U.S., allowing users to send Bitcoin, Ethereum, PYUSD, and more to PayPal, Venmo, and other digital wallets that support crypto and stablecoins.

The feature will first be available to users in the U.S. but will expand later this month to other markets, including the U.K., Italy, and elsewhere.

To create a PayPal Link, users open the PayPal app and enter the details of the payment or request to generate a unique, one-time link. This link is private and is associated with just that transaction.

These PayPal Links can then be used in online conversations, texts, and DMs where money, costs, and purchases are being discussed. Any unclaimed links expire after 10 days, though users can send out a reminder or cancel the payment link at any time, if needed.

The recipient taps the link to complete the request or to accept the payment in the PayPal app, where funds are transferred instantly. 

Personal payments remain exempt from 1099-K reporting, the company notes.

Trade tensions between China and the U.S. regarding semiconductors just got even more strained.

On Monday, China's State Administration for Market Regulation ruled that semiconductor giant Nvidia was in violation of the country's antitrust regulations, as first reported by Bloomberg. The ruling was in reference to Nvidia's 2020 acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, a computer networking supplier, for $7 billion.

An Nvidia spokesperson supplied the following statement, “We comply with the law in all respects. We will continue to cooperate with all relevant government agencies as they evaluate the impact of export controls on competition in the commercial markets.”

China didn't announce any consequences tied to its findings and will continue to investigate. Still, the ruling is likely to cast a pall over ongoing tariff negotiations between the U.S. and China, currently taking place in Madrid. While these trade discussions aren't specifically about semiconductors, the question of Chinese access to Nvidia chips is a major point of contention between the two regimes.

The outgoing Biden administration announced its AI Diffusion Rule back in January that was meant to restrict U.S.-made AI chips to many countries, with further restrictions specifically for China and other adversaries.

While the U.S. Department of Commerce formally repealed Biden's AI rule in May, the future of AI chip exports to China remains in flux. The Trump administration slapped licensing agreements on chips heading to China in April. A few months later, in July, these companies were given the green light to start selling these chips again.

Just a few weeks after that the country struck a deal requiring companies selling chips to China to give the U.S. a 15% cut of the revenue made on those sales. China has discouraged firms from buying Nvidia chips and, as of a recent earnings call, none of the company's chips have made it through the new export process.

Following its long-awaited launch of lossless streaming for paid subscribers, Spotify is upgrading its service for free users, too. On Monday, the company announced that free users globally will now be able to search and play any song they want or play a song shared by a friend or an artist they follow on social media. 

The company calls the new features “Pick & Play,” “Search & Play,” and “Share & Play,” respectively. With the former, free users can hit play in the Spotify app to pick and play any song they want, or can even search for a particular song and play it. 

The “Share & Play” feature could encourage free users to open Spotify when they come across music on social media. For instance, Instagram lets users share a Spotify track to Stories with sound and allows users to share music on Instagram Notes.

Previously, free users could shuffle songs with limited skips on mobile devices.  

Spotify says the new features will roll out globally to free users, but there will still be some restrictions that Premium users won't face. 

In recent months, Spotify's ad business has been struggling, with CEO Daniel Ek telling investors the company has been “moving too slowly” on this front. The streamer wants ad revenue to make up 20% of its overall revenue, but has grown it only to 11% as of June. By adding new free features, Spotify could boost engagement among its free user base, who would then be exposed to more ads.

Spotify says that other features, like its support for lossless, AI Playlists, and Mix, will remain Premium-only offerings, while others like the newly launched Messages and personalized playlist daylist, available to global users, will span both the free and paid experiences, as they had before.

The company's free users today make up the bulk of its user base. Out of Spotify's 696 million monthly active users in the most recent quarter, 433 million were free, ad-supported customers. In addition, there were 276 million Premium (paying) subscribers in the quarter.

The U.S. has reached a “framework” deal with China for social media platform TikTok, CNBC reported, citing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

“It's between two private parties, but the commercial terms have been agreed upon,” CNBC quoted Bessent as saying on the sidelines of a meeting between the two countries in Madrid on Monday.

The news comes barely an hour after U.S. president Donald Trump hinted on his social media platform Truth Social that a deal for the short-video app had been reached.

“A deal was also reached on a ‘certain' company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save,” Trump said in the post, adding that he will speak to China's president Xi Jinping on Friday.

Trump's post comes days before the fourth TikTok ban deadline on September 17, as delegations from both countries met in Madrid today to discuss economic policy. In June, the president indicated that he had found a group of buyers for TikTok.

Earlier on Monday, Reuters reported that the U.S. was ready to ban the social media app if China did not withdraw its demands for a reduction in tariffs and loosening limits around its technology.

The U.S. banned TikTok on January 19 after a federal law signed by former president Joe Biden went into effect. However, Trump has signed multiple executive orders since he took office to keep the app working in the country.

When Mark Lee was a law student at Harvard, a trademark class exposed him to the staggering scale of counterfeiting, an illicit industry worth more than $3 trillion annually, and set him on an unexpected path to entrepreneurship.

“I was always broadly interested in technology and startups, but I never really thought I'd be an entrepreneur. I assumed I was set to become a lawyer; most of my family members are lawyers, and practicing law felt like a natural path,” Lee said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. But when he got to Harvard Law, the education wasn't quite what he expected, Lee said, adding that he began to question whether a career as a corporate lawyer was the right fit.

“So I started exploring different ideas. One day, I took a trademark class and learned that counterfeiting is the world's largest criminal enterprise, $3 trillion in counterfeit products traded every year, about 8% of global commerce. What struck me was that during COVID, as everything was moving online, this already massive market was growing 20% a year, fueled by marketplaces and social media,” Lee continued. “I saw it as a universal problem—and one that could be solved with the technology I was passionate about at the time: computer vision.”

That insight became the seed for MarqVision, the company he later co-founded in 2021. The name itself reflects its origins: “Marq” from trademark, and “Vision” from computer vision. The mission was straightforward but ambitious: harness AI-powered computer vision to fight counterfeiting and trademark infringement on a global scale.

Fast forward to 2025 and the LA-headquartered AI startup has closed a $48 million Series B round, bringing its total capital raised to about $90 million.

Roughly half of the fresh capital will go toward expanding its AI and engineering teams to accelerate automation and integrate generative AI across its product suite. Another $10 million is earmarked for making the platform enterprise-ready as the company moves upmarket to target larger brands, while an additional $10 million will fund regional expansion. Already active in the U.S., Korea, China, and Europe, MarqVision is now entering Japan, highlighting the borderless nature of IP law and the company's push to scale globally.

The financing was led by Peak XV Partners — formerly Sequoia Capital India & SEA — with participation from Salesforce Ventures, HSG (formerly Sequoia China), Coral Capital, and Michael Seibel, partner emeritus at Y Combinator. Returning backers, including YC, Altos Ventures, and Atinum Investment, also joined the round.

“Increasingly, top-tier investors are looking for technology companies that leverage AI not just to enhance productivity, but to fundamentally transform service delivery,” Lee explained. “AI is expanding the total addressable market for software from efficiency tools into the execution of the work itself — unlocking a market opportunity of over $10 trillion. While many early-stage companies are experimenting with AI to disrupt labor-intensive service industries, very few have reached the early growth stage with the scale and traction.”

MarqVision serves more than 350 customers worldwide across industries ranging from fashion and luxury to gaming, pharmaceuticals, entertainment, automotive, and consumer electronics. The startup reached $1 million in annual recurring revenue within eight months, $10 million in three years, and recently crossed $20 million after four years, doubling annually along the way.

“Our goal is $100M ARR by mid-2027,” Lee said. “Growth could have been faster, but we prioritized two things: delivering the best customer experience and building a scalable AI-driven foundation. As a managed service, we can monetize many offerings, but everything ties back to one core promise—helping global brands control their digital presence and grow revenue.”

Once considered an unappealing category in technology, “services” is being redefined by AI, which brings software-like scalability and efficiency. This shift has fueled investor interest, with Peak XV, HSG, and Salesforce Ventures backing the company's vision. The rise of large language models has reframed its positioning from a “software company with humans in the loop” to a leader in the emerging AI-led services space, drawing strong competition in its latest funding round.

MarqVision started out fighting counterfeits, using AI to spot and remove fake products online. As the technology advanced, the startup shifted its focus toward helping brands directly recover lost revenue. Today, many clients report a roughly 5% boost in sales, making the platform valuable not just to legal teams but also to go-to-market organizations tracking revenue impact, according to Lee.

When Lee first pitched MarqVision, he envisioned a $5 billion software company, selling $50,000 tools to 10,000 IP teams worldwide. But YC partner Michael Seibel urged him to think bigger — beyond software — by reimagining how IP and brand professionals work. MarqVision has since expanded into end-to-end managed services, an opportunity Lee now believes is 100 times larger than his original plan.

Brand protection typically involves detecting and removing infringements like counterfeits and impersonations, while brand control goes further, giving companies the ability to manage their presence across e-commerce, social media, websites, and chat platforms, Lee noted. Looking ahead, the roadmap includes brand intelligence, offering insights into supply chains, pricing strategies, and reseller networks.

“Our vision is to be the backbone of every global brand that owns IP — becoming the AI-led services platform for IP, content, and brand professionals worldwide,” Lee said.

The thing I've most been convinced of in the past 5 years of building as much 'iot/smart home' stuff out as possible in my house is that nearly every vendor is selling crap that has marginal usefulness outside of a 'party trick' in isolation. Building out a whole smart home setup is frustrating unless it's all from one vendor, but there isn't one vendor which does all of it well for every need.On my phone I have apps for: Ecobee, Lutron, Hue, 4 separate camera vendors[1], Meross, and Smart Life. Probably a couple more that I'm forgetting.Only Lutron and Hue are reasonable in that they allow pretty comprehensive control to be done by a hub or HomeKit so I never have to use those apps.It's been years since Matter and Thread were supposedly settled upon as the new standards for control and networking, but the market is, instead of being full of compatible devices, instead absolutely packed with cheap wi-fi devices, each of which is cloud-dependent and demands to be administered and even used day-to-day only through a pile-of-garbage mobile app whose main purpose is to upsell you on some cloud services.[1] I admit the fact I have 4 is my fault for opportunistically buying cameras that were cheap rather than at least sticking with one vendor. But many people have a good excuse, perhaps one vendor makes the best doorbell camera, while another might make a better PTZ indoor camera.

It can stream to other stores, like Elasticsearch, but the current main focus is on PG to PG replication with DDL changes and anonymization.We've been using it in Xata to power  our `xata clone` functionality, which creates a ""staging replica"" on the Xata platform, with anonymized data that closely resembles production. Then one gets fast copy-on-write branching from this anonymized staging replica. This is great for creating dev branches and ephemeral environments.

Almost three years after Apple introduced the original AirPods Pro 2  (updated with USB-C in 2023) with category-defining sound quality and active noise cancellation (ANC), I can safely say that just about every company making ANC wireless earbuds has caught up or surpassed them, and often with buds that are sold for less than $250. Basic wireless earbuds features—good audio, good ANC, and good battery life—are table stakes, and each of these is improved on AirPods Pro 3. Apple's third-gen ANC wireless earbuds are an excellent gen-over-gen upgrade and an even bigger leap if you're coming from first-gen AirPods Pro.

But what's more interesting is seeing how Apple transforms the AirPods Pro 3 into a health and fitness-centric wearable and a vessel for AI features like Live Translation. To borrow a quote that's often misattributed to Wayne Gretzky, AirPods Pro 3 “skate to where the puck is going, not where it has been.”

AirPods Pro 3

Apple's third-gen ANC wireless earbuds improve all the basics and lay the foundation for going beyond audio with health and AI features.

Pros

Cons

I've never had complaints about the comfort and fit of AirPods Pro 2, so I was skeptical whether I'd feel any difference with AirPods Pro 3, which feature smaller buds with a more angled design, and foam-infused eartips. I've been using AirPods Pros almost daily since the originals came out in 2019, so I have a pretty good idea when the little white pieces of plastic that I stuff into my ears feel off—in a good way. AirPods Pro 3 sit deeper in my ears (your ears might be different), and the stems are just slightly farther away. I've been using the preinstalled medium-sized eartips on AirPods Pro 2 without issues, but just to see whether I'd get more noise passive noise cancellation from the new foam-infused eartips, I tried the small size tips, and lo and behold, they seemed to block out just a bit more environmental noise. So definitely try a size down if you're feeling like ANC could be better. Apple also includes an XXS size eartip (for a total of five sizes) this time around. (There's no USB-C cable in the box anymore, though, but who doesn't have a dozen of them lying around?)

See AirPods Pro 3 at Amazon

There are other subtle external changes, too. The inner vent is smaller; the outer vents are larger; and there's one more covering the heart rate sensor next to the eartip. The buds are also rated IP57 sweat- and water-resistant, which means they can be immersed in up to 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes and can survive heavier rain and dusty conditions. AirPods Pro 2 are only IPX4-rated, which is good for only splashes, and light rain and sweat.

The charging case is largely the same, save for some small tweaks. Most people won't notice this (I almost didn't), but the case is a teensy bit larger in all directions. Apple told me that the redesigned geometry of the buds required a slightly bigger case to ensure they'd slip in with the same satisfying clicks and snaps. Loose-fitting cases for older AirPods Pro should still be compatible with the AirPods Pro 3, but the ones that are snug might not, and you may need a new case. I don't do cases for my AirPods, so I'm fine sticking a cute keychain on the cases' built-in lanyard loop. The case also no longer has a physical button on the backside. Matching the AirPods 4 (with and without ANC), the AirPods Pro 3 case has a touch-sensitive button just below the battery indicator LED. Double-tapping it puts the wireless earbuds into pairing mode, and double-tapping it three times factory resets it.

Like any tech company, Apple takes every opportunity to boast about how it reengineered its products to offer even better this or that. For AirPods Pro 3, Apple says the wireless earbuds use a “new multiport acoustic architecture” for better sound across all frequencies—highs, mids, and lows. I'll leave the scientific tests to the audiophiles at SoundGuys and RTings, but to a regular Joe like myself, they sound virtually the same compared to AirPods Pro 2. That's not a knock—AirPods Pro 2 sound great—but we've reached a ceiling for sound quality in wireless earbuds. If there's any discernible difference, it's that the lows are just a bit cleaner, especially if you're using the AirPods Pro 3 in motion like running. Many of the bass-heavy tracks in the Power Hour playlist on Spotify sounded deeper with less distortion, and vocals sounded just a smidge clearer. I thought some of my favorite new songs from Linkin Park's latest album, “From Zero,” including “Stained” and “IGYEIH,” would sound miles better, but alas, they sound about the same. There wasn't much that Apple needed to improve in terms of sound quality, so I'm not surprised at all that any audible differences are minor. I'm fine with not messing with the already great sound. It's better than Apple forcing some kinda AI enhancement to remaster songs for the modern age and potentially ruining them.

Transparency mode is also more natural-sounding. Compared to other similar modes on other wireless earbuds that I've tried, like the Pixel Buds 2 Pro, Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, and Nothing Ear, I've always found Transparency mode on AirPods Pro 2 to sound the cleanest. Background noise is blended with music in such a way that it doesn't sound like a synthetic mode with tinniness or reverb that I've noticed on other wireless earbuds. On AirPods Pro 3, I could hear voices and ambient sounds mix more seamlessly with my music. It's subtle, but very nice!

ANC is a different story. Apple says it improved active noise cancellation by two times compared to AirPods Pro 2, and by four times compared to the first-gen AirPods Pro and AirPods 4 with ANC, which have the same level of noise cancellation. I don't have the tools to measure and verify that ANC claim, so again, I'll let the audio experts tackle that, but I can tell you the ANC (with the best-fitting eartip for my ears) is noticeably stronger in blocking out background noise. As I type this, I can't hear the whir of the Dyson Airblade fan from 10 feet across the room or even the battery-powered pocket fan on my desk. I didn't hear my cat, Kiwi, meowing like a maniac earlier when it was her dinner time. Outside, on the subway, the screeches and rumblings of the train were more drowned out compared to my AirPods Pro 2; I felt less irritated not having to hear a guy singing bad karaoke for two stops. All of this is to say, the ANC on AirPods Pro 3 is indeed better than on any other AirPods. Is it the best there is in any wireless earbuds? Better than the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds (2nd Gen) that my colleague James Pero says have “amazing ANC” and are best in class? Probably not—AirPods Pro 3 don't completely eliminate external sound—but they're gonna be more than enough for most people. Crank the volume up past 50% when you're listening to music, and you're gonna hear less environmental noise.

The biggest new addition in AirPods Pro 3 is the heart rate sensor. If you don't have an Apple Watch, you can use it to track your heart rate and calories while using the Fitness app. The Beats Powerbeats Pro 2, released in February, were Apple's first pair of wireless earbuds with a built-in heart rate sensor, but they fell short of being useful because you couldn't simultaneously track your heart rate and listen to music. Many reviewers also found the heart rate readings to be inaccurate compared to an Apple Watch, chest strap, or even smart rings like Oura.

Apple confirmed to Gizmodo that the heart rate sensor inside AirPods Pro 3 is completely different technology compared to the Powerbeats Pro 2 and wasn't based on it. Weird, how Beats is owned by Apple, but developed its own inferior tech. You'd think there would be more synergy between the two companies internally.

Either way, I'm happy to report that you can listen to music and get a real-time heart rate reading while using the AirPods Pro 3. I didn't have a chest strap monitor to compare the AirPods Pro 3 with, but there's a low deviation between the heart rate sensor in the wireless earbuds compared to an Apple Watch Series 9 and Series 10. Before, during, and after three outdoor walks and two 2-mile runs, I did back-to-back checks on the heart rate readings between the three wearables and found there was generally a beats per minute (bpm) difference between 1 and 5. Sometimes the AirPods Pro 3 and Apple Watches recorded the exact same heart rate. This heart rate variability is considered normal; anything higher than 5 bpm would have been reason to worry about the accuracy of the sensor in the AirPods Pro 3. Of course, there's always going to be some difference when you're measuring heart rate in your ear versus on your wrist or chest. There's also the matter of making sure the heart rate sensor on the AirPods Pro 3 is properly covered by your ear's front flap, or tragus. A poor fit could result in inaccurate heart rate readings, so keep that in mind.

You're probably thinking: if you have an iPhone, then you probably have an Apple Watch, so why would you need a heart rate sensor in AirPods Pro 3 as a duplicative feature? First, not everyone who has an iPhone owns an Apple Watch. Not everyone wants a smartwatch, though the new $250 Apple Watch SE 3 is going to be a value that's too good for fence-sitters to refuse. Second, the heart rate sensor in the AirPods Pro 3 is just a single stream of heart rate data. Apple says that, combined with an Apple Watch, you'll get multiple readings and the Health and Fitness apps will log whichever is the more accurate one. It's not an average of multiple connected heart rate sensors, Apple says. I pressed the company on what exactly “more accurate” means, but it seems it's keeping that info secret, only stating that the activity and calorie tracking reading is determined based on an AI model that was trained from over 50 million hours of data from its Apple Heart and Movement Study.

Companies have been trying to figure out how to shove real-time translations into wireless earbuds for years. Google first attempted live translations with its original Pixel Buds in 2017. To review them, I brought in two professional interpreters who had translated for UN conferences to help me test the accuracy and speed of Google Translate running on the Pixel Buds paired to a Pixel 2 XL. The results were not unexpected: the Pixel Buds were no replacements for live translations from humans. The live translation feature was convenient and helpful in a pinch, but clearly too literal in translations, and often incorrectly translated certain words or phrases. The professional interpreters were able to translate five times faster than waiting for Google to beam the translations from the cloud. Eight years later, Apple may have cracked it.

Live Translation on AirPods Pro 3 is the same feature, but it actually (mostly) works—in near real-time—from what I could gather. The number of supported languages at launch is short—English (UK), English (U.S.), French, German, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish (Spain)—but Apple says it plans to add Italian, Japanese, Korean, and Mandarin Chinese (Simplified) by the end of the year. As somebody who's been learning Mandarin Chinese and starting on Japanese, I was bummed I couldn't try out either. I'll have to revisit Live Translation when those languages are added.

I tested Live Translation in Spanish and French, though in most cases the Spanish was of the Mexican variety. Turning on Live Translation is easy, and there are several ways to do so. You can squeeze the stems of both buds, and your iPhone will launch the Translate app. You don't need to have the app open, but you'll get live transcriptions for both the language that is being translated and the one you're translating into. You can use a Siri Shortcut and map it to the Action button on a supported iPhone. Or you can simply say, “Siri, start Live Translation.” I found this to be the worst of the three ways, with the voice assistant constantly translating “live translation” into a language after the command. Siri also repeatedly got confused about where the start and end of a sentence I asked to be translated were. Clearly, Siri is still not as intelligent as it could and should be. Google's Gemini seems to misunderstand me a lot less on the Pixel 10 and Galaxy Z Fold 7.

I first tested translating Spanish with my friend Christian, who speaks it as her first language. We had a brief conversation about what types of food and activities there are to do in my neighborhood. She said the translations were about 95% accurate. There were some instances where the AirPods Pro 3 microphones failed to pick up on a few words that both of us said. For example, I tacked on “Thanks, honey” at the end of the convo, and the buds just didn't hear that part. I don't know if I spoke too quickly or too softly or what. It's not a dealbreaker unless you're mentioning something really important.

In classic Apple style, Live Translation has its nice attention to detail. When activated, ANC turns on and the beamforming mics in AirPods Pro 3 kick in to isolate the voice of the speaker directly in front of you so you can focus on what they're saying. If the other person is wearing AirPods Pro 3 (or Pro 2 or AirPods 4 with ANC), they'll get the same experience.

Then, I tried Live Translation with a fruit stand seller speaking Mexican Spanish, while Christian monitored the live transcriptions on my iPhone. I asked, “Can I get some fresh orange juice?” and the AirPods Pro 3 read back (and transcribed in the app), “¿Puedo conseguir un zuma de naranja fresco?” Christian told me that while that was correct because Live Translation was translating English to Spanish (Spain), she would have gone with “jugo” for juice instead of “zuma,” which is more common in conversational Spanish. Maybe one day, Apple Translate and Live Translation on AirPods Pro will be able to automatically detect accents and regional vocabulary, and personalize translations to them. For now, Live Translation seems to work mostly as advertised.

The best part of Live Translation is that it all works on-device—no internet connection is required. I tested it with the Wi-Fi turned off, and translations worked just as quickly. Of course, you will need to download the languages to your iPhone, so you will eat up some storage, but also your conversations (audio and transcriptions) are never saved on the device or anywhere in iCloud or the cloud, and Apple promises that it doesn't use any Live Translation data for training its AI models. That's a relief, because I don't need Apple or any AI knowing the very stupid conversations I like having with my international friends.

Another fun way I found to use Live Translation was while watching YouTube videos. I loaded up a video from a Spanish-speaker and turned the volume loud enough for the AirPods Pro 3 to pick up the audio and translate it back in real-time. All of a sudden, videos in Spanish became more accessible without having to glance down at the bottom of the screen and potentially missing what was happening. I compared the voice translations coming through the buds and the Translate app to the on-screen subtitles and auto-dubbed version from YouTube, and they seemed to track closely. AI voice translations are rapidly breaking down language barriers for video content, and I'm all for enabling more people to view and connect with videos regardless of their native tongue. What I'm not sure about just yet is using AI to deepfake or reproduce a person's voice (and sometimes even sync it to lip movements). Google's Pixel 10 phones have a feature called Voice Translate that does real-time voice translations (also on-device) during phone calls, but it clones your voice with near pitch-perfect tones and inflections. It's cool, creepy, and a month after reviewing the devices, I'm still not sure whether it's necessary. Google frames Voice Translate as “hear the voices you love, not a robot,” but this is going to be something consumers will decide whether it goes too far. Fortunately, you don't need to worry about deepfaked voices with AirPods Pro 3 and Live Translation—you get two female voices and a male one to choose from.

There are two ways to look at battery life for wireless earbuds: you can get longer battery life from a single charge for the buds and fewer hours total with the charging case, or less continuous listening time with the buds and more total hours with the charging case. On AirPods Pro 2, the buds could last up to 6 hours with ANC and get up to 30 hours total with the case—that's five additional charges. On AirPods Pro 3, Apple bumped up the buds an extra 2 hours to 8 hours on a single charge, but reduced the total amount of battery with the case to 24 hours—so you only get two extra charges.

That's an upgrade if you prefer more continuous listening time, like for a long-haul flight. But it's a downgrade if you want more battery life on the go. This split between continuous listening battery life and total battery life with the case is equal to Sony's WF-1000XM5 wireless earbuds. Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen) get up to 6 hours with ANC and only 24 hours total with the case.

This change may mean trips to the outlet sooner than before. I really wish Apple had sped up the fast charging. A 5-minute charge still provides only 1 hour of listening time, just like on AirPods Pro 2.

There are some other features that are nice, like the ability to press the stem of a bud to click the shutter when you've got the Camera app open; good if you're a vlogger or want to snap a photo with your iPhone propped up from afar. AirPods Pro 3 also have a newer Ultrawide band chip inside the charging case that lets you find them using Precision Find My from 1.5x farther away, according to Apple. I've maybe used Precision Find My only a handful of times with my AirPods Pro 2, so it's not a big addition for me, but if you're always misplacing your wireless earbuds, it could come in handy.

Apple is also doing more for hearing health and assistance, with the hearing test that you can take during setup for the AirPods Pro 3 now being scientifically validated.

Combined with the upgraded basics for sound, ANC, battery life, and durability, AirPods Pro 3 are an even better wireless earbuds package than the AirPods Pro 2. The price is still the same $250 MSRP, but if the deep sales on AirPods Pro 2 in the past years are any indication, AirPods Pro 3 may drop to $200 or $150 this holiday season. Yes, there are probably better-value ANC wireless earbuds out there, but they're not buds that are designed to pair and switch seamlessly between Apple devices. Nor will other wireless earbuds have the same tight integration with Apple services, like the heart rate tracking and Live Translation that are only possible with iPhone and the Fitness app. If you've got an Android phone, you'll get all the better core wireless earbuds features, but you won't get the health and AI stuff, and that's where the puck is going. With AirPods Pro 3, you're getting a front-row seat to where things are headed. I would bet money that once Apple gets its Apple Intelligence-powered Siri back on track, that's when we'll really see AI in AirPods open new doors.

The old debate of form over function remains true with iOS 26 and the final version that launched for all iPhones today. There's all but a faint whiff of that long-promised Apple Intelligence, though you'll still find plenty to love and more to complain about with the switch from iOS 18 all the way to the “26” generation.

Remember to set aside some storage on iPhone, as the update will demand a good chunk. iOS 26 showed up as 6GB for me on my iPhone 14 Pro, coming from version iOS 18.6. (Apple is also pushing out iOS 18.7 today.) Our senior editor, Raymond Wong, got the update on his iPhone 16 Pro and noted it was 14.9GB. So your mileage will vary depending on your device and software version.

Along with iOS 26, Apple also released iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, visionOS 26, and all the rest. The iPhone 17 lineup, from the 17 Pros to the Air, will come preinstalled with the new software update when those new phones launch on Sept. 19. Every Apple product now shares a similar design language centered on the “Liquid Glass” look. The UI is full of semi-transparent windows and bubbles that can distort and contort text and images underneath it, as if you were looking through a convex glass lens. It's a means of separating the controls from the content itself. The changes are both subtle and overt. For instance, the “Search” button on iPhones may blend more into your background wallpaper. In apps like Apple Music, the “Now Playing” bar will display a hint of the album artwork underneath it.

The iOS 26 release may be the most controversial since the drastic changes made to iOS 7 back in 2013. Users didn't appreciate having to watch short animations before getting into their apps. Many complained about the UI hiding useful buttons, making it harder for power users to find the right tools for the job. Despite the controversy, skeuomorphism—where Apple tried incorporating more familiar images and designs, such as the battery image representing battery life—still remains to this day. That brings us to now and the emphasis on “glassmorphism,” emphasizing opaque windows for a pseudo-3D effect.

As somebody who has used multiple versions of the iPadOS 26 and macOS 26 betas extensively during the beta period this past summer, I appreciated some design changes more than others. Apple removing the opaque layer for the menu bar at the top of the Mac screen helps make the screen feel larger without sacrificing functionality. Spotlight has also been beefed up to take actions directly in apps like Messages without having to click on the icon and type out your text to a recipient. The Mac is now more connected to the iPhone than ever with Live Activities, letting you monitor iPhone notifications without unlocking and fiddling with the device. Clicking on those notifications also opens up the iPhone Mirroring, a feature that was introduced in last year's macOS Sequoia. It's not all great, however. There's no more Launchpad available in the dock, and to bring it back you need to muck around in Terminal. Instead, you're granted an “Apps” folder that is overloaded with all your iPhone apps in addition to those you installed on Mac.

macOS 26 also sports a few more minor additions, like the largely ineffectual Game Overlay. All that functionality is now bedecked in the translucent layer of glass, from your app icons to the Control Center. The real innovation was saved for Apple's tablets. The iPad is now far more usable as a dedicated laptop replacement for all your tasks. Apple added the ability to have multiple apps open on-screen at once. You can tile them just by flicking them to the right or left side of the screen. If you want to watch YouTube and type up your notes, it's now easier than the previous Stage Manager or dual-screen solutions.

Apple has fine-tuned Liquid Glass from its initial dev beta into the public beta and again for the final release. The early versions were practically incoherent, especially with text layered over text. Follow-up betas dialed back some of the glass and liquid effect for a more “frosted glass” aesthetic. The latest public betas honed in on the current design, where you can catch a hint of content underneath menus, as if staring into a pool of glassy water. The effect wants to evoke something tangible, like you're doing more than scrolling pixels on a pane of glass. After months of playing with all the various betas, I still would prefer a version of Liquid Glass that matches up to the name.

Regular Apple users who use their iPhone for little more than accessing their camera or their TikTok feeds may not understand the hate, but the most-dedicated iPhone aficionados may grow impatient with the new design. Critics say Liquid Glass distracts you from the functions of each app. Some developers publicly lambasted the new design that sticks important functionality behind hamburger menus (those three horizontal bars that open up drop-down menus). Then again, that's a fact of life for living in Apple's ecosystem. The company is more concerned with devices that focus apps for specific use types.

Inevitably, you'll run up against a single instance where the glass garbles words or distracts you from an important part of a text or email. In that moment, you'll wish to scrap the entire exercise, decry Apple's hubris, and wish to switch back to iOS 18. After those fleeting moments where the raw hate overflows, you'll just keep using your devices the way you always have.

We've previously covered some of Hypershell's pro-level exoskeleton suits, and been impressed by them. Now the brand new Hypershell X Ultra is here, upping the specs and appeal in almost every department, ready to claim the title of the best outdoor exoskeleton on the market.

These exoskeletons are designed to fit comfortably and snugly around your frame, enabling you to travel farther for longer, and attempt hikes and challenges that might otherwise be beyond you. Even better, they adapt and adjust to your movements and the effort you're putting in, to feel like a natural extension of your body.

See X Ultra at Hypershell



It's a futuristic bit of kit that can transform your outdoor adventures, pushing your walks and your cycles to greater heights and farther distances, and unlocking a new level of human capabilities. With the addition of the X Ultra to the existing Hypershell range, the bar has been raised once again.

Some of the headline improvements here are a brand new M-One Ultra motor system—with one motor fitted to each hip—that provides 1000W of peak output (up from a maximum of 800W on previous models): That's 1.3 horsepower attached directly to your body. Range on the X Ultra is extended to 30 kilometers or 18.6 miles, up from 17.5 km (10.9 miles) on the X Pro and X Carbon.

Those improvements are in part down to the improved motor efficiency, which now stands at more than 90 percent, and the AI algorithms that analyze your movements in real time, ready to adjust the enhancements provided by the exoskeleton as you cross terrain. At times, it almost feels like you're flying.

So how can that be quantified out in the real world? Based on Hypershell testing, the new X Ultra can reduce physical exertion by up to 22 percent for walking and 39 percent for cycling, while heart rate can be lowered by up to 40 percent during exercise.



Do the calculations on your own outdoor expeditions, and you'll realize the kind of difference the Hypershell X Ultra is able to make. It can operate from -20°C to 60°C (that's -4°F to 140°F), it weighs a mere 1.8 kilograms (just under 4 pounds), and the aerospace-grade materials that the exoskeleton is made from—including carbon fiber—come with an IP54 rating to guard against dust, rain, and snow.

These figures and claims don't just come from Hypershell either. The performance of the exoskeleton has been meticulously audited and independently verified by the SGS (Société Générale de Surveillance) SA in Switzerland, one of the global leaders in testing, inspection, and certification.

There are more upgrades to talk about here as well. There's a new enhanced knee protection feature, which adjusts the assistance mode automatically when the exoskeleton senses you're going downhill—another example of how the technology works intelligently in the background to best help you, without you needing to dig through settings or open up an app.

With knee protection enabled, buffering is deployed that reduces impact on the descending leg while also increasing support on the stance leg. In addition, knee joint rigidity is enhanced, which means the wear and tear on your knees is minimized even on the most challenging of downhill descents.



You've also got smarter assistance and smarter movement in the new Hypershell X Ultra: The design and engineering of the exoskeleton has been further refined to offer extra assistance when you're accelerating or just getting started during runs and cycles, and there are new modes for getting across snow and dunes.

That brings the total number of modes available to you to 12, really showcasing the versatility and flexibility of the device. Those 12 modes are: Cycling, Down Stairs, Up Stairs, Downhill, Uphill, Mountain, Walking, Speed Walking, Running, Gravel, and the new Snow and Dune options.

The modes that the exoskeleton puts you in, as well as the other settings that control how the Hypershell X Ultra operates, can be adjusted through the companion Hypershell+ app for Android and iOS. It's also now available on watchOS for the first time, meaning instant control from your wrist even without your phone.

From camping expeditions to mountain biking, you don't need to worry about where you take the Hypershell X Ultra. It's lightweight, ultra-strong, and scratch-resistant, so you're not going to have to replace it after your first couple of trips: It's been put together to be as demanding as you are.



Now with four years of experience in the business, Hypershell has rolled all of its expertise into the new X Ultra exoskeleton, and it shows. Whether you're training for an Ironman, trying to keep pace with your kids on hiking vacations, or wanting to get to places that would otherwise be off limits, it's perfectly placed.

The mission of the Hypershell X Ultra is to get you moving farther, stronger, and smarter, giving you access to an even better, augmented version of yourself for your outdoor activities. The price for this cutting edge piece of technology is less than you might think as well: The exoskeleton can be yours for $1,999.

Futurama's new season is being called its 13th by Hulu, but the show, which premiered in 1999, has had a stop-and-start presence over the years across Fox, Comedy Central, and straight-to-video movies. The show's latest season—its third on Hulu—is again treading new ground, getting an all-in-one binge release.

One consistent element across Futurama's discombobulated history has been its loyal fans, so it seems unlikely that dropping the entire season in one go will be a strike against it. Still, the revolving message in the opening credits cautions viewers to “pace yourself” as the first episode begins.

That advice proves all too easy to ignore, though, as season 13 delivers a strong 10-episode punch full of clever writing and funny performances. While we've been fond of previous Hulu seasons, lucky 13 feels propelled by an extra jolt of energy. Now that Futurama is settled at Hulu, with season 14 already confirmed (and presumably the chance for more), you can imagine perhaps some of the pressure has lifted behind the scenes.

On-screen, that translates to a consistently enjoyable set of episodes; not all of them are instant classics, but even the lesser entries have goofy asides that make them more than worthy. As is Futurama tradition, the stories blend the quirks of life among the weirdos of far-future New New York with themes that feel plucked from more recent times, including screen addiction, greedy health care companies, monster movies, climate change, foodie culture, the great science vs. religion debate, and the unkillable “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory.

All the plot hijinks—deep-space missions, get-rich-quick schemes, professional and personal rivalries, interdimensional adventures, etc.—are made more resonant by the ways they draw on Futurama's well-established characters, especially the dynamics between them.

Leela's romance with Fry is a frequent touchstone, but we also dig into her complicated relationship with her kind but clueless sewer-dwelling parents. Amy and Kif's marriage and children, especially the teenage Axl, figure prominently across the season; there's also an emphasis put on Hermes' attempts to connect with Dwight, his own teenage son.

Unattached characters like Professor Farnsworth and Bender—who put their flirting “skills” on display in separate episodes, aiming for very different sorts of would-be conquests—also get their moments in the spotlight. Even Dr. Zoidberg, a character who usually works best in small doses, gets an arc that shows some surprising emotional depth under all the dumpster diving.

Alongside some very funny guest stars we won't spoil here, a lot of favorite supporting cast members also appear, including the insufferable Zapp Brannigan and mechanical fan favorites like the Robot Devil, Robot Santa Claus, Calculon, and Hedonismbot. As always, season 13 does an admirable job incorporating those characters in inspired ways, rather than just sticking them into episodes for no reason other than to have them show up.

If Futurama's creators have any worries about the binge release affecting the show's ratings—sure, there's always the danger that people will watch the whole season in one or two days, then move on, never to return.

But Futurama has built its following on fans who've become accustomed to watching favorite episodes over and over. There was no better way to endure all those long, uncertain gaps between seasons; prior to the show's Hulu revival, it had been almost exactly 10 years since the show closed up shop on Comedy Central.

Burn through season 13 once, and you'll be entertained. But the real rewards come when you go through the episodes a second or third time, when those over-the-top Bender line deliveries, pun-laden background gags, or random references—Paul Lynde on Hollywood Squares; a Shawshank Redemption-endorsed rock hammer; the meanest yet funniest John Williams dig ever—really sink in.

It's good to have you back, Futurama. The 31st century, you tease, has many terrible aspects, but at least they're consistently amusingly terrible, and that brings its own kind of wacky hope. All of season 13 is now streaming on Hulu.

It is also touted as a great choice for people with disabilities, and as an environmentally friendly product.

Over the years, there have been many and varied attempts to replace the ubiquitous computer mouse. Here's another one, called Finger Maus. As 3D Printing Industry magazine highlights, this innovation comes from Mausware, a startup backed by American artist, designer, and inventor Max Eternity. Finger Maus has been in development since 2020, and should hit crowdfunding (Indiegogo) very soon. Whether it can rival the best wireless mice in 2025, remains to be seen.

 




Finger Maus is claimed to improve on your typical deskbound mouse in several ways. The first major benefit of this finger-sleeve mouse, according to its maker, is that it can be comfortably worn on one of several fingers, and it will particularly appeal to user niches like the elderly, or those with any movement impairments.

While Mausware's Indiegogo is yet to materialize, despite mentions of an August launch by the source, there are more product details on the firm's website. Here we learn that the Finger Maus is all things to all people – typical marketing. However, some things are difficult to dispute, such as the fact that the new wireless pointing device is small and light (25g), and that it doesn't require a ""mousing"" surface to do its stuff.

In the above Finger Maus video, you can see a few more aspects of the Finger Maus Ultra design, which aren't mentioned by the two linked sources. There are two nubs to the left of the Finger Maus, as worn, which we guess are used for things like left and right-clicking, scrolling, or another modifier. On the top of the mouse is a USB-C port, for recharging, and it is also likely used for firmware updates. On the underside of the device appears to be a transparent window for the sensor.

Also in the video we see that a Finger Maus ‘Classico' is teased, a more rounded model which looks like it has a flexing joint. Until now, we've only been sharing images, details, and specs for the Ultra model.

Another feather in the Finger Maus cap is there by virtue of its green credentials. Apparently, this 20g (some sources say 25g) wearable uses “80% less plastic” than a typical mouse. Moreover, being “made from plant-based, 3D printed resin that is non-toxic and biodegradable,” its eco-credentials are further boosted.

 




Adopting a new pointing device is a very personal decision. I've been through lots of devices, and was even sucked into the Leap Motion controller campaign back in 2012/13, acquiring one of these 3D gesture-based sensors. It was disappointing, to say the least. Other fancy looking super-ergonomic devices have also soon found themselves in the spares cupboard.

Engineer and origami artist Bogdan Ionescu, AKA BogdanTheGeek, has created a web server that runs on a disposable vape. Inspired by his growing collection of these disposables, and prior work he had done on semihosting on any Arm CPU using “a few lines of code,” Bogdan had a lightbulb moment and decided to host “a web server on a vape,” thus creating the VapeServer.

Disposable vapes can contain a surprising amount of computing power/components. Bogdan had been collecting discarded units for ‘future projects' for a couple of years, with eyes on reusing the batteries. However, he recently became aware of “fancier” units that pack more advanced ICs and microcontrollers. They didn't just contain PCBs with unknown ‘blob chips.' He found some with more advanced microcontrollers.

Bogdan says one of the fancier units he disassembled contained an IC marked ‘PUYA C642F15.' This sparked some research, and the engineer determined that this was actually a PY32F002B, which has the following specs:

Those are not stellar specs, and perhaps “about 100x slower” than a 10-year-old mobile, by our hero's estimation. For web serving, though, Bogdan thought the PY32F002B-powered ex-vape with USB-C port could be leveraged to make a “blazingly fast” device.

The method, in brief, would see Bogdan emulate a dial-up modem on the microcontroller using SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol) over the USB serial connection. Linux ‘slattach' and ‘socat' utilities enabled IP packet transmission, and then the microcontroller leveraged the compact uIP stack to communicate via TCP/IP and set up a web server. The web page, a copy of the linked blog post, just about fit in the remaining 20KB of flash on the PY32F002B.

Optimization to get a usably performant web server presented several challenges. Bogdan says he almost gave up after the first tests, with the vape-powered performance being laughably bad. Pings were ~1.5s, and a simple page load took 20 seconds.

However, he humbly admits the big issue was his code. So the engineer added a buffer and batched writes to improve throughput, and with a few more tweaks managed to get pings down to 20ms with no packet loss, and full-page loading in about 160ms. Not bad.

The source link from Bogdan's blog we shared isn't hosted on this vape-powered web server. However, if you are really curious, you can try this link to get the post served from the VapeServer. We say ‘try' because the vape-hosted page is currently throwing up a ‘503' error, probably due to being overloaded by visitors.

Bogdan has also shared the semihost-ip project code for the VapeServer on GitHub.

Four digit FPS


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


According to many esports competitors, AMD currently makes the best gaming CPUs on the market, thanks in part to its revolutionary 3D V-Cache technology that stacks extra cache atop the CCD to boost FPS across the board. At the moment, as part of its Zen 5 line-up, AMD has the highest-performing processors on both mobile and desktop, and the company is clearly not shy to flaunt that. In what seems to be a new presentation from China, the Red Team has shown a promo for its CPUs hitting 1000 FPS in certain games.

Originally spotted by @realVictor_M, AMD calls this its ""1000 FPS Club"" in a promotional slide translated from Chinese to English. Its members are the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, Ryzen 9 9950X3D, and the mobile Ryzen 9 9955HX3D. Notably, the 9900X3D is missing from this list — perhaps because it does offer ~6% less performance in games. Regardless, the chipmaker says these X3D CPUs can cross the four-digit barrier officially in six titles when playing at 1080p resolution:

The slide includes the table with the above-mentioned games, along with details on what hardware combinations were used to cross 1000 FPS in these titles. Funny enough, only the RTX 5080 and 5090D (China-exclusive cutdown RTX 5090) can cross the mark in all six titles, when paired with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D and Ryzen 9 9950X3D, respectively. AMD's own Radeon RX 9070 XT only managed to hit 1000 FPS in Valorant and League of Legends.

Moreover, 6000 MT/s CL30 RAM was used for the testing, running on Windows 11 with Smart Access Memory (SAM/Resizable BAR) and virtualization disabled. AMD did not show benchmarks for the mobile 9955HX3D despite mentioning it as part of its 1000 FPS Club, so we'll just have to take its word for it. There was no specific cooler listed either so — as long as you're keeping these beasts in check, preventing them from thermal throttling — you too can expect to enjoy a glorious thousand frames.

Of course, 1000 Hz monitors don't exist yet so this is just an in-house flex of sorts, boasting how far ahead AMD is when it comes to gaming prowess. The fastest gaming monitors today are 720 Hz OLED panels that achieve that refresh rate while running in dual mode at a low 720p resolution. Perhaps, AMD can squeeze out even more frames at those settings.

More than meets the eye.

Nvidia unveiled the Rubin CPX GPU earlier this week at the AI Technology Conference as part of its next-generation data center portfolio, which is designed to accelerate inference workloads. Rubin CPX, in particular, focuses on compute rather than bandwidth to form the other part of a ""disaggregated"" AI architecture that will kick off with Vera Rubin next year. Today, however, a closer look at its silicon suggests there might be more to this AI accelerator than Nvidia has let on, with some speculating that it could even lay the groundwork for an RTX 6090.

High Yield, an independent semiconductor analyst, recently extended his work to Rubin CPX, labelling the up-close die shot Nvidia released as part of the press material. This is just an artistic render—which could be inaccurate, so take the news with a healthy dose of skepticism— but that didn't stop High Yield from discovering something strange: the presence of graphics-specific hardware blocks. He found a full set of Raster Output Pipelines (ROP), raster units, and even display engines on Rubin CPX — all of which are components irrelevant to AI tasks.

Some quick assumptions about @Nvidia's new Rubin CPX. Quiet similar to GB202, with some obvious changes to the GPCs. Looks like it has full raster units (full GPU) with up to 256 ROPs. Could this be the RTX 6090? (even though Rubin was supposed to be AI only) pic.twitter.com/EBRYpH39VBSeptember 10, 2025

High Yield's labelling highlights 16 Graphics Processing Clusters (GPC), each with 6 Texture Processing Clusters (TPC), which would add up to 192 Streaming Multiprocessors (SM) — same as the Blackwell-based RTX 5090. But there are also 256 Raster Output Pipelines (ROP) on this die, along with four display pipes — again, taking up precious die area for an otherwise AI-only GPU. That makes Rubin CPX a different beast altogether because the GB202 powering the 5090 has just 170 ROPs and 12 GPCs, in comparison.

For a potential RTX 6090, Nvidia would almost certainly follow its usual practice of repurposing partially functional dies. Even with two GPCs disabled, Rubin CPX would still deliver around 28,672 CUDA cores and 224 ROPs, showing a notable increase over the RTX 5090's 21,760 CUDA cores and 176 ROPs, respectively.

On the other hand, if Nvidia retains the 8 TPC-per-GPC layout carried over from Blackwell, the design could scale up to 32,768 CUDA cores. After accounting for typical yield-related cuts of roughly 10%, that still points to a gaming SKU in the 28,000+ CUDA core range, suggesting a 28–30% performance uplift gen-on-gen. That's even before factoring in clock speed or architectural refinements.

Moreover, the render also shows a 512-bit memory bus using GDDR7, and possibly 128 MB of L2 cache. That would push effective memory bandwidth to nearly 2 TB/s, comfortably ahead of the RTX 5090's 1.8 TB/s (on a 512-bit interface as well). Not only that, but support for PCIe 6.0, and the presence of video engines further point toward a possibility that Rubin CPX—while an AI accelerator today—is also a stepping stone for what's to come tomorrow.

 




If Rubin CPX is indeed the precursor to the RTX 6090, it would represent one of the largest, most feature-complete dies Nvidia has ever shipped. With up to 256 ROPs, far more than the 176 ROPs in GB202, Rubin CPX's GPU could hypothetically deliver significant gains in traditional rasterization at higher resolutions, along with improvements in pixel throughput.

Rubin CPX will be released at the end of 2026, following Vera Rubin's launch. They will combine to form what Nvidia bills as its most advanced and efficient AI inference solution ever. The RTX 6090, on the other hand, should be announced at CES 2027 if Nvidia follows the patterns from previous years. Therefore, the timeline lines up, but it's far from confirmed. But right now we have to remain skeptical.

AI isn't just consuming the GPU market. It's eating storage, too — and the shockwaves are likely to hit both HDD and SSD markets

The computing market is absolutely ablaze with AI-driven growth. Regardless of how sustainable it might be, companies are spending untold amounts of wealth on hardware, with most headlines revolving around GPUs. But the storage market is also under pressure, especially hard drive vendors who purportedly haven't done much to increase manufacturing capacity in a decade. TrendForce says lead times for high-capacity ""nearline"" hard drives have ballooned to over 52 weeks — more than a full year.

TredForce posted two articles on essentially the same topic today. One of them includes a letter from Western Digital to its customers warning of ""unprecedented demand for every capacity in [its] portfolio,"" and stating that it is raising prices on all of its hard drives. WD says, of course, that this is ""to support this growth and ensure continued excellence,"" but of course, the company will benefit from the bump to its margins and thus, profits.

📈 Following SanDisk's 10% #NAND hike and Micron's week-long pricing freeze, #WesternDigital is joining the price-raise club! #HDDs across all capacities are set to go up, and ocean freight delays could stretch delivery by weeks—better plan your orders now!💡More:… pic.twitter.com/iFj1vCPW5ESeptember 15, 2025

If you're unfamiliar with the term, ""nearline"" refers to storage that is not quite online, yet also not quite offline. It's ""warm"" data, information that needs to be available for ready access, but doesn't have to be as quick or responsive as the SSDs that serve as primary online storage for essentially all systems now. Because it isn't constantly being accessed, hard drives can fill this role in an economical fashion. While SSDs have made huge strides in price-per-gigabyte, hard disks are still typically four to five times cheaper by capacity.

Generative AI, as a class of workload, implies tremendous demands for nearline storage. Obviously, generative AI can spew out an unlimited pile of output, but it's not just the AI models' output that is filling up servers' storage. The software infrastructure to both set up and run generative AI workloads is itself quite heavy: Training datasets, model checkpoints, inference logs, and more specialized fine-tuning datasets can all eat up petabytes of data in a shockingly short amount of time.

 




That's why the trendline for warm storage is going vertical: You don't just need the data required to run inference. You also need the history of everything to prove to regulators that you're not laundering bias, to retrain when new data comes in, and to roll back to a previous checkpoint if your fine-tuned model goes feral and, say, starts referring to itself as MechaHitler. This stuff can't go to offline storage until you're certain it isn't needed in the short term. But it's too big to live in the primary storage of all but the beefiest servers. Thus, the need for nearline hard drives.

Because the supply of hard drives is insufficient, cloud service providers (CSPs) and other hyperscalers might be looking at economical QLC SSDs for cold data storage. This has its benefits; performance is better, physical density can be improved, power consumption is typically lower, and most importantly, they're actually available to purchase. However, as we noted, SSD prices start at around four times the cost per gigabyte, and that adds up real quick when you're buying hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of terabytes of storage.

In response, Trendforce reports that memory suppliers are actively developing SSD products intended for deployment in nearline service. These should help bring costs down once they hit the market. But in the short term, we can expect the storage crunch to cause rising SSD prices as well, at least for enterprise drives. If you're keen on picking up some solid-state storage, it might not be a bad idea to start shopping now. Make sure you check out our list of the best SSDs for 2025 before you do.

This may also be another indirect tactic in the ongoing trade negotiations.

China's market regulatory body accused Nvidia of violating anti-monopoly laws Monday after the conclusion of a preliminary investigation.

The specifics of the alleged breach remain murky, but the timing suggests it is indirectly related to the ongoing trade talks between the two countries in Spain. With much of those talks relating to China's access to high-end American processors for AI training and inference, Reuters reports, some believe China may be leveraging its legal system as a negotiating tool to encourage more favorable terms.

China launched the investigation into Nvidia's business practices related to Chinese anti-monopoly laws in December 2024, with authorities claiming it suspected Nvidia of violating the commitments it made when purchasing the Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies in 2020.

At the time it was seen as a retaliatory action aimed at the U.S. administration's restrictions on Chinese access to high-end GPUs for AI workloads. Since then the Trump administration and Chinese authorities have gone back and forth on whether Nvidia products could be sold to the country, and if so what types, and in what quantities.

The uncertainty has lead to the growth of smuggling and black-market operations, and China pushing for more domestic chip production and adoption among its high-tech firms. That included accusing Nvidia of adding tracking hardware to its graphics chips; a practice Nvidia has denied.

But now China claims it has fallen afoul of domestic law for which punitive fines can be quite extensive. In theory, it could levy fines of between 1% and 10% of its annual sales from the previous year.

It may not come to that, though, if it turns out this is just part of China's negotiating tactic with the U.S. during talks that are taking place in Madrid this week. Alongside a potential sale of social media company, TikTok, to an American firm, China's access to Nvidia's cutting-edge AI hardware is expected to be on the table.

This latest news follows the Chinese Minister of Commerce announcing over the weekend that it was initiating an an anti-dumping investigation into analog IC chips imported from America from companies like Texas Instruments and ON Semiconductor.

Vice president of the China Semiconductor Industry Association, has also called on China and other Asian countries to halt their use of Nvidia GPUs permanently, and instead to develop new application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) for the task. He claimed that such an over-reliance on America would pose a long-term risk to Chinese AI independence.

Jo  Shorthouse

 September 15, 2025  

A community-based study in Olmsted County, Minnesota, has documented the distribution of myocardial infarction (MI) causes in patients younger than 65 years, showing significant sex differences.

Published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, the study analyzed 4116 troponin-positive events in 2780 patients between 2003 and 2018. Researchers found that 53% vs 25% of heart attacks in women vs men aged 65 years or younger were due to nonatherosclerotic causes.

Investigators classified MIs into six categories: atherothrombosis, spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), embolism, vasospasm, myocardial infarction with nonobstructed coronary arteries of unknown cause (MINOCA-U), and supply-demand mismatch (SSDM).

In women younger than 65 years, 47% of MIs were caused by atherothrombosis and 53% by other mechanisms. The breakdown included SSDM (34%), SCAD (11%), vasospasm (3%), embolism (2%), and MINOCA-U (3%). In contrast, atherothrombosis represented 75% of MIs in men younger than 65 years.

“The most important take-home message is the need for heightened recognition of nonatherosclerotic causes of acute coronary syndrome, particularly in younger patients and women,” said lead author Claire E. Raphael, MBBS, PhD, from Mayo Clinic's Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota. “These patients often lack traditional cardiovascular risk factors, and as a result, their symptoms may not always trigger a full cardiac workup.”

The study reported that 55% of SCAD cases were initially misclassified, often as atherothrombotic disease or MINOCA. The incidence of SCAD was 5.2 vs 0.9 per 100,000 person-years in women vs men.

Most reclassifications occurred in cases presented before 2012, with 80% of the 61 revised cases occurring during this earlier period. Recognition improved after 2012, coinciding with research that defined angiographic characteristics and management strategies for SCAD.

“Recognition of SCAD improved dramatically after 2012,” Raphael noted, referencing pivotal publications that defined angiographic hallmarks and highlighted procedural considerations.

Five-year mortality varied widely:

“Supply-demand mismatch is fundamentally a marker of severe systemic illness rather than a primary cardiac event, and its prognosis is largely driven by the underlying noncardiac disease burden,” explained co-author Rajiv Gulati, MD, PhD, also from Mayo Clinic.

Commenting on the paper, C. Noel Bairey Merz, MD, director of the Barbra Streisand Women's Heart Center at Cedars-Sinai, Los Angeles, observed changes in clinical practice. “I think it's happening now,” she said, referring to recognition of conditions like SCAD. “I see fellows presenting SCAD cases, probably not as much as we would like, but I do think the interventional community, the younger trainees, are on it,” she told Medscape Medical News.

Raphael and colleagues described specific angiographic approaches used in their diagnostic process. “During invasive angiography, meticulous technique is paramount,” Raphael explained. “This includes ensuring adequate contrast opacification, performing long cine runs, and carefully interrogating the distal vasculature, where subtle dissections or embolic lesions can otherwise be missed.”

In uncertain cases, the team used second-operator review and intravascular imaging with intravascular ultrasound or optical coherence tomography.

The study found that 34% of patients with nonatherothrombotic coronary MI underwent cardiovascular MRI, 19% received intracoronary imaging, and 1% had invasive provocation testing.

Women had lower overall heart attack incidence than men (48 vs 137 per 100,000 person-years), particularly for atherothrombotic causes (23 vs 105 per 100,000 person-years). In women younger than 45 years, SSDM was the most common cause of heart attack, and acute nonatherothrombotic coronary causes collectively occurred as frequently as atherothrombosis.

Bairey Merz noted ongoing knowledge gaps, particularly regarding type 2 MIs. “We don't know best practices,” she said. “The prognosis is not great, but it's not horrible either.”

The research represents what the authors describe as the first community-based study determining incidence and outcomes of individual causes of heart attack in a younger population. The study design used troponin T elevation above the 99th percentile as the sole inclusion criterion to maximize event capture.

The cohort was predominantly White (78%), and the authors acknowledged that findings may not be generalizable to other populations. They noted this as a key research gap requiring future investigation across different racial, ethnic, and geographic populations.

“Most of the patients in our study were White Americans, so we do not know if the cause of heart attacks would be different in a different population,” the authors stated in their interview with Medscape Medical News.

The study provides baseline epidemiologic data on cause-specific heart attack incidence in younger patients, with researchers noting that the availability of International Classification of Diseases codes for type 2 MI may enable future large registry studies to expand understanding across diverse populations.

Raphael reported receiving modest consulting fees from Phillips and Abbott Vascular.

SEATTLE — A machine learning-based clinical decision-support tool predicted hip fracture risk from electronic medical records in Sweden with a significantly higher sensitivity than fracture liaison service (FLS).

The tool has a significant advantage over other approaches in predicting fracture risk because it does not require patient contact, said Mattias Lorentzon, MD, PhD, chief physician at the Osteoporosis Clinic at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden, during presentation of the results at the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) 2025 Annual Meeting.

The machine-learning model predicted 2-year fracture risk with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 compared with 0.55 for the commonly used FLS approach of screening people who have had a fracture in the past year.

“This high accuracy was largely sustained over longer follow-up periods and after accounting for competing risk of death. And finally, the implementation of [machine learning] has potential to be used for general population screening or implemented in electronic health records, which would allow automated risk prediction that would enhance the identification of high-risk patients. And by doing this, we could target more of the high-risk patients and reduce hip fracture rates,” said Lorentzon.

Claus Glüer, PhD, recently retired professor of medical physics at Kiel University in Kiel, Germany, who attended the presentation, called the study “very, very important” during the Q&A session. He endorsed the value of the approach for population studies but questioned Lorentzon as to whether the predictive factors would be applicable to individual patients in the physician's office. Lorentzon acknowledged the concern and said that one of the next steps for the research is to test the tool against bone mineral density and other commonly used individual risk factors to “see if it accurately captures those who would benefit from treatment.”

Another attendee asked Lorentzon about the need to validate the results in other populations. “We are hoping in the near future to be able to run our algorithm and test it in the Danish registered data set, which is very similar to the Swedish, so we hope to have external validation soon,” he replied.

But even the best population databases may be missing key data such as family history of hip fractures, Glüer said in an interview. He noted that it's unclear if the Swedish database includes such information, although it “seems to be one of the most complete ones.”

He also wondered further about the applicability of the results to the physician's office. “The strongest risk factors that we typically encounter in osteoporosis, like prior fractures, certain diseases like Parkinson's, et cetera. Probably you capture that person's risk by just looking at the one, two, or three strongest risk factors in that individual — much simpler and much more individualized. I'm not sure whether all the candidate predictors that are in this population-based model would be the same or the most relevant ones if you're dealing with an individual patient. It remains to be tested,” Glüer said.

He endorsed the approach for use in policy decisions. “You get the overall picture in the entire population, including prevalence of the disease and prospects to really calculate the burden of the disease. And also, maybe you can estimate how much you could do if you change your policy by providing earlier treatment,” he added.

In the study, the researchers analyzed data from all individuals living in Sweden between 2011 and 2013 who were at least 50 years old and had not previously been exposed to osteoporosis medicine (n = 3,542,647). All participants were followed up until the end of 2021.

They analyzed national register data that included fractures, comorbidities, surgery, socioeconomic factors, mortality, and prescriptions, including a total of 140,131 variables that encompassed diagnoses, medications, procedures, and demographics. The researchers divided the population into discovery (25%), development (65%), and validation (10%) cohorts. There were 142,327 hip fractures over an average of 9.04 years of follow-up.

The machine-learning model, using 2500 variables, predicted 1-year fracture risk with an AUC of 0.89, a 2-year AUC of 0.88, a 5-year AUC of 0.83, and a 10-year value of 0.82. A simplified model with 35 variables performed nearly as well, with corresponding AUC values of 0.88, 0.87, 0.85, and 0.81.

The most influential variables for prediction were age, sex, number of prescriptions, marital status, alcohol-related disorders, anti-dementia drugs, and hospital stay days in the previous 2 years. FLS-based screening for fracture risk yielded a 2-year AUC of 0.55.

At 2 years, the machine-learning method would have identified about seven times more individuals at risk for fracture than the FLS approach (sensitivity, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.82-0.85 vs 0.12; 95% CI, 0.11-0.13), although with a lower specificity (0.79; 95% CI, 0.79-0.79 vs 0.98; 95% CI, 0.98-0.98).

The study was funded by the Swedish Research Council, the Sahlgrenska University Hospital Research Funds, and the Gothenburg Medical Society. Lorentzon declared receiving lecture or consulting fees from Amgen, UCB, Janssen, Astellas, Alexion, Consilient Health, Parexel International, Medac, Medison, Pharmacosmos, and Gedeon Richter. Glüer declared having no relevant financial disclosures.

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), which assess symptoms, functional status, and quality of life, had independent prognostic value for overall survival in patients with cancer, according to a meta-analysis of 31 clinical trials. Better physical and role functioning, in particular, were associated with improved survival.

The results highlighted the “unique prognostic value” of PROs, over and above traditional clinical and disease-related factors, the study authors wrote. An invited commentary called such patient reports “the missing variable” in both routine care and clinical trials. “These data highlight the importance of the patient's voice, while supporting increasing efforts to develop, test, and implement baseline clinical decision support tools that integrate PROs to enhance survival prediction and inform clinical trial enrollment and routine care,” wrote Jamie Takayesu, MD, and Erin F. Gillespie, MD, MPH, of the University of Washington, Seattle.

The study, led by Ryan Huang, MSc, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, was published online in JAMA Oncology.

Variability in design, populations, and cancer types could have led to heterogeneity in findings. Selective populations of randomized controlled trials might limit the applicability of these prognostic associations. The study could not rank prognostic strength across PRO domains due to overlapping HR CIs.

A new study showed that cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) or flutter in the emergency department (ED) was safe and highly effective in patients with class III or IV obesity, with a 92.3% success rate and no adverse airway events.

""This is the first study to describe Emergency Physician's ability to [manage] both the procedural sedation and electrical cardioversion of class III and class IV obese patients,"" the authors wrote. ""The use of DCCV [for] recent-onset AF in obese patients is both safe and effective when performed in the ED setting,"" they added.

The study was led by Alfred Sacchetti, MD, Virtua Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Camden, New Jersey. It was published online on August 12, 2025, in The American Journal of Emergency Medicine.

The study's single-center, retrospective design may have limited the generalizability of the findings, and variations in emergency physicians' practice patterns may have affected outcomes. The relatively small sample size of patients with severe obesity may have reduced the study's statistical power.

No funding source was reported for the study, and the authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

The threat of antimicrobial resistance — the ability of organisms to defeat the very drugs designed to kill them — is well known in modern medicine. It is the reason infections are becoming harder to treat. It is one explanation for higher healthcare costs, longer hospital stays, and more than 35,000 deaths in the US alone.

Antimicrobial stewardship, a coordinated effort to promote optimal use of antimicrobials, can turn all that around, improving the health and well-being of all while also saving money, experts said.

Pediatric hospitalists have an important role in antimicrobial stewardship, according to speakers at a recent Pediatric Hospital Medicine meeting in Anaheim, California.

“We do so much antibiotic prescribing,” said Kristina Nazareth-Pidgeon, MD, inpatient medical director of general pediatrics at Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, in a post-meeting interview with Medscape Medical News. And that prescribing is not always appropriate, contributing to the threat of resistance.

While studies have found that 30%-50% of antibiotics prescribed for hospitalized patients of all ages are inappropriate, data on pediatric patients are limited. One recent analysis looked at antibiotic prescribing at 32 US children's hospitals and found that 1 in 3 pediatric hospital patients are given antibiotics during their stay.

For that study, researchers evaluated the hospitalized children with one or more antibiotic orders at 8 AM on one day per calendar quarter over 6 quarters from 2016 to 2017 to determine the appropriateness of the prescriptions. Antimicrobial stewardship program physicians or pharmacists used a standardized survey, collecting data on the orders and evaluating the appropriateness.

The researchers found that of the 1 in 3 receiving one or more antibiotics at any given time, one quarter were receiving suboptimal therapy, and nearly half of that was not captured by current antimicrobial stewardship program practices.

Of the 34,927 children hospitalized on survey days, 12,213 (35%) had one or more active antibiotic orders. The most common reasons for inappropriate use were a mismatch of bug to drug, surgical prophylaxis for more than 24 hours, overly broad empiric therapy, and unnecessary treatment. 

Before getting to the question of prescribing, Nazareth-Pidgeon said four areas need to be considered:

Antibiotic stewardship involves giving the right drug at the right dose to the right patient for the right duration, she said. The goal is to optimize antibiotic use. 

Antibiograms are important, Nazareth-Pidgeon said, and should be leveraged. Defined as an overall profile of antimicrobial susceptibility testing results of a specific microorganism to a battery of antimicrobial medications, the antibiogram profile is created by the laboratory. It uses aggregate data from a healthcare system or a hospital. 

According to Nazareth-Pidgeon, the Clinical and Lab Standards Institute is typically credited with creating the concept.

Using antibiograms effectively is critical, Nazareth-Pidgeon said. “There are studies that show patterns within a hospital can be different on different floors,” she said. “The bone marrow unit may have different patterns than the general peds wards.”

How to use antibiograms effectively? “Use as local [data] as possible,” Nazareth-Pidgeon said. Update information regularly. Keep the information pediatric-specific and unit-specific, when possible, she said.

Pediatric-specific information, not adult, “is essential for the best care of our patients,” said Laura Lemley Hampton, MD, assistant professor of pediatrics and director of pediatric quality improvement at the Children's Hospital of Georgia at Wellstar MCG Health, Augusta, Georgia.

“Practical strategies and support do exist, even if you don't have a pediatric infectious disease physician specialist at your hospital,” she said.

Her suggestions are to engage key stakeholders at your hospital, such as your pharmacist, your infection prevention team, and the microbiology lab. Discuss how you can embed the antimicrobial stewardship program into your quality improvement program.

Many consider those as two separate entities, she said, but she said that's not the best approach. “Marrying the two and embedding them [both] into the quality improvement program is helpful.”

Measuring impact is critical, Lemley Hampton said. “You have to track pediatric-specific metrics to demonstrate value and improvement.” She suggests using the resources from the CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network.

Be proactive about penicillin allergy delabeling, Nazareth-Pidgeon said. According to the CDC, 10% of the population reports a penicillin allergy, but less than 1% are truly allergic. Because of this, Nazareth-Pidgeon said, broad-spectrum antibiotics are used more. “Being proactive and delabeling patients from their penicillin allergies allows for the use of more narrow-spectrum antibiotics,” a goal to decrease antimicrobial resistance. The CDC has step-by-step suggestions on how to do so.

To do well with antimicrobial stewardship, “you don't need to be an expert in terms of having an infectious disease background,” said Margaret Oates Poisson, PharmD, pediatric pharmacy specialist at Children's Hospital of Georgia at Wellstar MCG Health and pharmacy representative to its stewardship program. Nor does a hospital need a formal program to practice stewardship, she and others said.

“Engaging key team members — pharmacy being one — when evaluating can be helpful,” Oates Poisson told Medscape Medical News.

Among the common questions she gets are how cultures are interpreted and how antibiotics are selected. “If you can engage your pharmacist, everyone can be a steward of antimicrobials.”

The talk had valuable takeaways for clinicians, said Aruni Gunaratne, MD, pediatric hospitalist and outpatient general pediatrician at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, DC, who attended. She cited an audience poll question asking about the most important variable in detecting bacteremia or fungemia in a blood culture.

“It was interesting to learn during the talk that the most important variable in detecting bacteremia or fungemia is the blood culture volume,” she said. (The other choices were timing of blood draw, technique and care in obtaining the specimen, and lab detection device interpretation.)

“Sometimes, as physicians, we are not always present during the actual blood culture draw, as our role is typically to decide whether a blood culture is needed and to place the order for a blood culture to be drawn.” Learning that the blood culture volume is crucial for accurate and sensitive detection of the bacteremia or fungemia, she said, “I plan to incorporate this into my future practice.”

In one study, more clinically significant microorganisms were found when two tubes of blood were collected compared with one.

Gunaratne said she would also suggest that colleagues reevaluate the antibiotic plan during rounds for each patient, because appropriate stewardship can change daily depending on new lab results, the patient's clinical status, and other factors.

“Discussing the antibiotic plan on rounds can help expose trainees, such as residents, medical students, and pharmacy students, to the thought process behind antibiotic stewardship discussions,” she said, which can help them when they make their own decisions in the future.

Lemley Hampton, Nazareth-Pidgeon, Oates Poisson, and Gunaratne reported having no disclosures.

In patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) who fail to respond to the initial therapy of hydroxyurea, the interferon drug ropeginterferon alfa-2b (ropeg) showed significantly improved responses and other important outcomes compared with the platelet-reducing agent anagrelide, new research suggests.

“Ropeg is now an approved option for patients with polycythemia vera (PV), and these [new] findings validate the role of ropeg in patients with the related condition of ET, in this case evidence for its benefit in the second-line setting,” senior author Ruben Mesa, MD, of the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, told Medscape Medical News.

Mesa was commenting on research that he and colleagues presented at Society of Hematologic Oncology (SOHO) 2025 held in Houston last week.

“If this leads to an additional FDA indication for ropeg in ET, it would be first approved new option for ET since anagrelide and would match the long-standing NCCN [National Comprehensive Cancer Network] guideline recommendations of considering a long-acting interferon for ET,” Mesa added.

For patients with high-risk ET, as many as a third are either intolerant of or fail to respond to the standard-of-care treatment of hydroxyurea. Anagrelide represents a standard second-line agent, however, no new therapy has been approved for ET in the US since anagrelide was approved in 1997.

ET, a myeloproliferative neoplasm, is a rare chronic blood cancer. Also known as primary thrombocythemia, this bone marrow disorder causes the overproduction of abnormal platelets.

Ropeg is currently approved for the treatment of PV, which, like ET, is also a Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm, hence raising the interest in its potential use for ET, however, the drug is not currently approved for ET.

To investigate, the researchers conducted the phase 3 SURPASS-ET randomized trial, enrolling 174 patients with ET who were intolerant or refractory to hydroxyurea.

Patients in the ropeg group (n = 91) were treated with a starting dose of 250 mcg, titrating to 350 mcg at week 2 and then, if tolerated, to 500 mcg from week 4 every 2 weeks.

The median age was 61 years in the ropeg group and 64 years in the anagrelide group; the groups were about half women; the median spleen size was somewhat smaller in the ropeg group (median, 13.10 cm vs 15.15) with no significant differences in other characteristics.

The study's primary endpoint was response to modified European LeukemiaNet criteria, including at least a 10-point decrease in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Symptom Assessment Form Total Symptom Score for at least 12 weeks, normalization of peripheral blood counts for at least 12 weeks, absence of vascular events and disease progression, and disappearance of bone marrow histological abnormalities.

The primary endpoint was met at 9 and 12 months by 42.9% in the ropeg group vs just 6% in the anagrelide group (P = .0001).

Specifically, the platelet count response rate was met in 56% in the ropeg group vs 21.7% in the anagrelide group, white blood cell count response was achieved in 73.6% vs 13.3%, and peripheral blood count remission was achieved in 56% vs 6.0%.

In further outcomes, improvement or nonprogression of splenomegaly occurred in 87.9% and 54.2% of ropeg and anagrelide patients, respectively, and an absence of hemorrhagic or thrombotic events occurred in 84.6% and 51.8% of patients, respectively.

While no molecular response was observed in the anagrelide group, those in the ropeg group had 30.7% in JAK2 V617F and 30.0% in CALR molecular responses.

Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 23.1% in the ropeg group vs 33.8% in the anagrelide group, and serious adverse events occurred in 15.4% vs 30.0%.

Adverse event-related discontinuations occurred in just 5.5% in the ropeg group vs 20.0% in the anagrelide group.

“Ropeg has very long-term follow-up for patients with PV, a disease with a very similar biology and natural history, so this is reassuring from a long-term safety and tolerability standpoint,” Mesa said.

Of note, ropeg is also discussed in the context of representing an important alternative to peginterferon alfa-2a (peg-IFN), which is also sometimes used for patients with ET who don't respond to hydroxyurea, but which has faced global shortages due to increased use for myeloproliferative neoplasms and a change in manufacturer that significantly slowed supply.

In a letter published last spring in the Annals of Hematology, Mesa and colleagues highlighted ropeg as an important viable alternative to the “critical shortage of peg-IFN” and offered guidance on switching patients with ET as well as PV to ropeg.

“Our group has accumulated experience in transitioning patients from peg-IFN to ropeg-IFN due to historic insurance issues and clinical trial participation, allowing us to propose practical strategies for safe conversion,” they reported.

“A best-practice approach to dose equivalence, based on collective experience and real-world data, is pragmatic given that no formal head-to-head dosing trials exist.”

The dosing, as well as important monitoring recommendations, are detailed in their letter.

“It is logical, based on efficacy, safety, and impact of molecular burden of disease of ropeg for PV, that we would see similar benefits in trials with ET,” Mesa said. “SURPASS ET provides now phase 3 data proving the safety, efficacy, and impact on variant allele frequency for ET in the second line.”

This study was sponsored by PharmaEssentia. Mesa disclosed relationships with AbbVie, Blueprint, BMS, CTI, Genentech, Geron, GSK, Incyte, Morphosys, Novartis, Sierra, Sierra Oncology, and Telios.

Exposure to fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) was associated with more advanced Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC) and faster cognitive decline, a large brain autopsy study showed.

Higher PM2.5 at a person's last known address was associated with more severe amyloid and tau pathologies after just 1 year of exposure compared with changes observed in individuals exposed to lower levels of air pollution.

“This study shows that air pollution doesn't just increase the risk of dementia — it actually makes Alzheimer's disease worse,” Edward Lee, MD, PhD, co-director of the Institute on Aging at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, said in a news release. “As researchers continue to search for new treatments, it's important to uncover all of the factors that contribute to the disease, including the influence of the environment in which they live.”

The study was published online on September 8 in JAMA Neurology.

Previous research evaluated a link between PM2.5 and ADNC but not to other dementia-related pathologies. The current study is the first to look at associations among PM2.5, neurodegenerative disease pathology, and cognitive and functional outcomes.

Investigators studied brain samples from 602 autopsies (mean age, 78 years; 55% men) from 1999 to 2022 from the Penn Medicine Brain Bank.

Investigators measured four tau, beta-amyloid, alpha-synuclein, and TDP-43 proteinopathies and assessed infarcts, amyloid angiopathy, and arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular lesions. They also investigated whether cerebrovascular pathology contributed to cognitive impairment.

Neuropathological outcomes included Thal amyloid phase, Braak stage, Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) score, level of ADNC, absence or presence of Lewey Body Disease, and LATE-NC stage.

Dementia was assessed using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB).

Overall, the median CDR-SB score was 12, suggesting a moderate level of dementia. The most common diagnosis was AD (47%), followed by Parkinson's disease (14%).

More than 50% of the total cohort had severe AD, including 71% who had Thal amyloid phase 4/5, 64% who had Braak stage V/VI, 64% who had a CERAD score of 3, and 62% who had high overall ADNC.

Investigators matched each individual's geocoded residential addresses before death or before the last CDR-SB assessment (up to 5 years prior to death) to calculate 1-year mean PM2.5concentration exposure.

The median 1-year mean PM2.5 concentration before death was 9.4 µg/m3. In adjusted models, higher PM2.5 exposure correlated to increased odds of more severe AD neuropathology.

For example, for every 1 µg/m3 increase in 1-year mean PM2.5 exposure before death, researchers found a 17% higher odds of a higher Thal amyloid phase, 20% higher odds of higher Braak stage, 20% higher odds of lower CERAD score, and 19% increased odds of increased overall ADNC.

Each of these factors was significant (P < .001).

In the subgroup with data based on last CDR-SB assessment, researchers found similar associations with pollution exposure, again indicating greater cognitive and functional impairment with greater PM2.5 levels.

“Population-based autopsy studies are further needed to replicate our findings and better understand relationships among PM2.5 exposure, cognition, and neuropathology,” the authors noted.

Study limitations included lack of adjustment for physical and leisure activities, smoking or alcohol history, differences between urban and rural exposures, and other confounders. Nearly 95% of the cases were White individual, which could limit the generalizability of the findings. And a large proportion of autopsies that did not include cases with vascular dementia, which could have resulted in selection bias.

This study was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Lee reported receiving grants from NIH during the conduct of the study and personal fees from Eli Lilly and Wavebreak Therapeutics outside the submitted work.

Cannabis use was associated with a nearly fourfold increased risk of developing diabetes over a 5-year period, according to an analysis of real-world data from more than 4 million adults.

“As cannabis becomes more widely available and socially accepted, and legalised in various jurisdictions, it is essential to understand its potential health risks,” the lead author noted. 

“These new insights from reliable real-world evidence highlight the importance of integrating diabetes risk awareness into substance use disorder treatment and counselling, as well as the need for healthcare professional to routinely talk to patients about cannabis use so that they can understand their overall diabetes risk and potential need for metabolic monitoring,” he added.

The study was led by Ibrahim Kamel, MD, MHA, Boston Medical Center. It will be presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes Annual Meeting in Vienna, September 15-19, 2025. 

Because of its retrospective design, the study could not conclude if cannabis use actually caused diabetes. Detailed information on cannabis consumption was absent. Despite propensity score matching, other confounded factors might have influenced results.

The authors reported no relevant conflicts of interest.

Scientists discovered that just one round of exercise can change blood chemistry in breast cancer survivors, releasing proteins that help suppress tumor cell growth in laboratory experiments and pointing to exercise as a powerful, non-drug therapy.

Study: A single bout of resistance or high-intensity interval training increases anti-cancer myokines and suppresses cancer cell growth in vitro in survivors of breast cancer. Image credit: shevtsovy/Shutterstock.com

A recent study in Breast Cancer Research and Treatment assessed the impact of a single bout of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) versus resistance training (RT) on anti-cancer myokines and in vitro cancer cell suppression in breast cancer survivors, potentially contributing to a lower risk of recurrence.

International guidelines support the use of exercise as a therapeutic intervention in the management of breast cancer. Exercise is safe and effective both during and after treatments for breast cancer to improve various health-related cancer outcomes, such as cardiorespiratory fitness and fatigue.

Research also shows that among breast cancer patients, exercise is associated with an approximately 20% lower risk for recurrence and mortality. Physical fitness is associated with a 31 to 46% risk reduction in all-cause mortality. Furthermore, exercise poses almost negligible risk of morbidity compared to other therapeutic interventions. Further research is needed to understand the biological mechanisms underlying the relationship between exercise and improved survival.

Skeletal muscle secretes myokines, which suppress the growth of cancer cells in various cancer cell lines. In specific breast cancer subtypes, IL-6 induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation, and decorin alters the tumor microenvironment and inhibits receptor tyrosine kinases. Studies have shown that serum collected after a single exercise bout reduces cancer cell growth in different cancer types, including breast cancer. However, the effect of different exercise modes on myokine expression and their suppressive effects on breast cancer cells have not been studied yet.

The current study assessed the effects of RT and HIIT on cancer cell suppression and myokine expression in breast cancer survivors. It also studied whether the two exercise modes induce different responses in cancer cell suppression and myokine levels. The sample comprised women with a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 35 kg/m2 and had been initially diagnosed with stage I–III breast cancer. They had also completed primary treatment and been medically cleared for exercise.

Blood samples were collected at baseline (following a 2-hour fast), after an acute exercise session (0P), and half an hour after exercise (30P), and the serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), decorin, oncostatin M (OSM), and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) were analyzed.

Subsequently, the negative growth of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was examined. Cell growth was monitored every 15 minutes to calculate the area under the curve (AUC).

A total of 32 breast cancer survivors were recruited and were randomly assigned to the RT or HIIT group in a 1:1 ratio. The mean age of the participants was 58.6 years, with a mean BMI of 27.9 kg/m². Participants were diagnosed with breast cancer on average for 29.3 months. Approximately 34%, 41% and 25% of the participants were at stage I, stage II, and stage III of breast cancer, respectively.

Significant changes were observed for RT at repeated time points for decorin, IL-6, OSM, and SPARC. Furthermore, a significant elevation in decorin by 23%, IL-6 by 9%, and SPARC by 15% was estimated at 0P. Significant increases in IL-6 and OSM were observed at 30P compared to baseline.

For HIIT, significant changes were observed at repeated time points for decorin, IL-6, and SPARC. At 0P, there were significant increases in decorin, IL-6, and SPARC. Furthermore, a significant increase in IL-6 was observed at 30P compared to baseline.

This study observed no significant adverse events during the single exercise bout. Concerning between-group changes of serum myokine levels, a statistically significant effect was only observed for IL-6 at 0P, with a greater increase in favour of HIIT.

Real-time cellular analysis revealed only a statistically significant effect for the AUC at 0P. A greater reduction was observed in favor of HIIT. For both RT and HIIT, considerable changes were found at repeated time points for the AUC. Compared to baseline, significant reductions in MDA-MB-231 cell growth were observed at 0P and 30P.

The current study highlighted that both RT and HIIT induce acute changes in circulating myokines and reduce cancer cell growth. Both RT and HIIT had a prominent cancer-suppressive effect on MDA-MB-231 cells.

The research findings favored HIIT compared with RT for a greater increase in IL-6 levels and the inhibitory effects on cancer cells immediately after exercise. Therefore, a single bout of exercise at moderate to high intensity could be considered an accessible, non-pharmacological intervention that may contribute to cancer control; however, the long-term effects on recurrence remain to be determined in breast cancer survivors.

In the future, more research is required to determine the long-term effects of this intervention on disease recurrence in breast cancer survivors.

People living in the UK and following a diet close to the Mediterranean diet are more likely to have better gum health, with potentially lower amounts of gum disease and inflammation. 

Findings from a King's College London study indicate that people not following a Mediterranean – style diet tended to have more severe gum disease, especially if they consumed red meat frequently. 

In these patients, the researchers observed higher levels of circulating inflammatory markers, such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP). 

However, patients whose diets were rich in plant-based food which are typical of a Mediterranean diet, such as legumes, vegetables, fruits and olive oil, showed lower levels of various inflammatory markers. 

The research, published today in the Journal of Periodontology, evaluated 200 hospital patients enrolled in the King's College London Oral, Dental and Craniofacial Biobank by performing dental exams, taking blood samples, and asking them about their diets through questionnaires. 

The Mediterranean diet is known for its emphasis on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats. It has been associated with a lower risk of developing major diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and certain cancers. 

There is substantial evidence showing that diet might play a role on human health by affecting the immune system and moderating inflammation. This depends on the composition of molecules in the diet, which include macronutrients, micronutrients and phytochemicals. Plant-based diets can contain more of these molecules which can lead to lower inflammation. 

Our findings suggest that a balanced, Mediterranean-type diet could potentially reduce gum disease and systemic inflammation. 

We observed that there may be a connection between periodontal disease severity, diet, and inflammation. These aspects should be holistically considered when assessing the treatment for periodontitis in patients. Our research offers an important starting point that can lead to more research to better understand the relationship between foods intake and gum disease."" 

Dr. Giuseppe Mainas, first author of the study and postdoctoral researcher, King's College London

Professor Luigi Nibali, lead author and a Professor of Periodontology from King's College London said: ""There is emerging evidence about the role that a balanced diet might have in maintaining a periodontal healthy status. Our research shows the potential effect that a nutrient-dense, plant-rich diet could play in improving the nation's gum health. Nevertheless, more investigation is needed to develop personalised approaches to help people manage their gum health.""

By reframing migraine as an energy deficit disorder, this review spotlights ketogenic therapy as a targeted metabolic intervention that could lower attack frequency and drug reliance, pending high-quality trials and structured monitoring.



Review: The Hypometabolic State of the Migraine Brain: Is a Ketogenic Diet the Answer? Image Credit: Lightspring / Shutterstock

In a recent Brain and Behavior review paper, researchers in Australia examined evidence linking metabolic dysfunctions to chronic migraines. They also explored ketogenic diets (KDs) as a possible therapy.

They found that KDs may reduce migraine frequency and pain intensity. KDs may also help migraine patients use less medication. However, large, rigorous randomized trials are still needed to confirm these findings.

The link between metabolic dysfunction and migraine has been recognized for nearly a century. In 1935, researchers observed that hypoglycemia could trigger migraine attacks and that correcting low blood sugar relieved symptoms.

In 1982, elevated lactate levels in blood and cerebrospinal fluid during migraines suggested that the brain's oxygen supply was low. These early findings highlighted metabolic abnormalities as key to migraine pathophysiology.

Current evidence suggests that migraines result from a combination of interrelated metabolic disturbances. These include mitochondrial dysfunction, imbalances in the gut microbiome, neuroinflammation coupled with oxidative stress, weight regulation problems, and impaired glucose metabolism. Such disruptions may collectively drive the hypometabolic state frequently seen in migraine patients.

Following a KD alters energy metabolism by shifting the brain's fuel source from glucose to ketones, and has been proposed as a way to correct these abnormalities. Historical and recent studies suggest that KDs may reduce migraine burden by improving cerebral metabolism.

Migraine progression involves multiple phases tied closely to energy imbalance. Early prodromal symptoms, such as yawning, cravings, and fatigue, may represent the body's attempts to conserve or restore energy.

During aura, cortical spreading depression (CSD) consumes large amounts of glucose, worsening the brain's metabolic deficit.

This wave triggers the trigeminovascular system, releasing inflammatory neuropeptides like CGRP and substance P, which amplify pain and sensitivity. Recovery from CSD further heightens oxygen and energy demands, creating hypoxia and mitochondrial stress.

Mitochondria, which are responsible for producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), are impaired in migraine, leaving the brain in a chronic state of energy deficiency. Excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) overwhelm antioxidant defenses, contributing to inflammation and the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).

Imaging studies show reduced ATP levels (up to 16% lower) and impaired mitochondrial enzyme function in migraine patients, correlating with attack severity. This dysfunction may explain the overlap between migraine and mitochondrial disorders.

Disrupted glucose metabolism also plays a role. Migraine sufferers often exhibit insulin resistance, limiting glucose entry into the brain during periods of high demand. Fasting and hypoglycemia are known triggers. Scans confirm that migraine brains frequently exceed their glucose supply during stimulation, leaving them vulnerable to attacks.

The gut-brain axis is influenced by altered microbiota compositions, with migraine patients exhibiting higher levels of pathogenic bacteria and lower levels of beneficial strains.

While gastrointestinal symptoms suggest a role for gut health, the efficacy of probiotic therapies remains inconclusive. Neuroinflammation is another key mechanism, with elevated pro-inflammatory peptides sustaining headaches.

Finally, obesity increases migraine risk and severity, possibly through adipose-driven inflammation and higher CGRP levels. Weight loss, whether via bariatric surgery or lifestyle changes, consistently improves migraine frequency and intensity.

Ketosis can be achieved through either a KD or caloric restriction. The KD is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat, moderate-protein diet designed to mimic fasting while providing a steady source of energy.

When glucose is depleted, the body metabolizes fatty acids into ketone bodies such as beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), acetoacetate, and acetone. BHB can supply up to 75% of the brain's energy, offering a more efficient fuel source than glucose.

Several KD variations exist, the most restrictive being the ‘classical' 4:1 fat-to-carbohydrate plus protein ratio, in which 90% of calories come from fat.

However, less strict forms, such as modified Atkins diets, are more tolerable and widely used, aiming to achieve physiological ketosis within a range of 0.5–5 mmol/L of serum BHB.

The review paper emphasizes that the diet should be initiated under the guidance of a dietitian and a medical professional to minimize the risk of complications. Without expert supervision, individuals may experience side effects like ""keto flu"" (nausea and dizziness), renal stones, vitamin deficiencies, and hypotension. The paper also notes that some animal studies raise concerns about potential long-term risks, such as accelerated atherosclerosis associated with a high-fat diet, although long-term human data are lacking.

Research on KD for chronic migraine dates back to the late 1920s. Early case series reported that approximately half of patients experienced reduced headache frequency or resolution, although the methods used were inconsistent.

More recent randomized controlled trials and observational studies, predominantly from Italy, consistently show reductions in monthly migraine days, headache duration, and medication use among KD groups compared to standard or low-calorie diets.

Some studies have found correlations between ketone levels and symptom improvement. However, ketone measurement methods varied widely, with significant differences in macronutrient ratios, inconsistent (or absent) ketone monitoring, and varying patient populations, including one notable study on patients with both chronic migraine and medication-overuse headache.

Despite differences in macronutrient composition, study design, and compliance, the findings suggest that KD may be an effective non-drug therapy for chronic migraines, warranting larger, standardized trials.

The review also examined ketogenic supplements, such as medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) and oral exogenous ketones, as a less restrictive alternative to the full diet. However, the authors found that the evidence for these supplements is currently limited and inconclusive. One study on beta-hydroxybutyrate salt suggested that supplementation did not provide the same benefits as intensive KD therapy, indicating that the diet's effects may go beyond ketosis alone.

The KD shows promise as a preventive strategy for chronic migraine, likely by addressing cerebral hypometabolism, a key factor in migraine pathophysiology.

However, robust prospective trials are needed to assess its safety, tolerability, effectiveness, and mechanisms. Future studies should clearly report macronutrient ratios, transition timing, and methods of ketone measurement.

Standardized reporting would enable meaningful comparisons across studies and help establish evidence-based clinical guidelines for incorporating KD into the management of chronic migraines.

A specialist form of therapy could offer hope for some of the most vulnerable young PTSD sufferers – according to a University of East Anglia study.

Researchers investigated the effectiveness of trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for treating children who had been through multiple traumas such as abuse, violence or serious accidents.

While this type of therapy is already known to help with PTSD, the new study focused on children who had experienced multiple traumas - a group often considered harder to treat.

The large clinical trial, funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), is one of the first of its kind to test this approach in real-world settings.

The research team hope that this therapy could offer a lifeline to some of the most vulnerable young people.

Lead researcher Prof Richard Meiser-Stedman, from UEA's Norwich Medical School, said: ""Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a deeply distressing and disabling psychiatric condition.

""Recent research has shown that more than seven per cent of young people in the UK will have developed PTSD at some point by the age of 18. 

""For many young people it may persist for years or even decades if untreated.

""We wanted to find out whether trauma-focused CBT, which concentrates on helping young people make sense of their experiences, could help.

Trauma-focused therapy is a specialised type of psychotherapy designed to help people process and recover from traumatic experiences. It focuses on addressing the impact of trauma on mental, emotional, and behavioral well-being – to help people develop coping mechanisms and a healthier understanding of their experiences.

A total of 120 eight to 17-year-olds took part in the study. These children had all been through multiple traumas and were seeking help through mental health services across the UK.

Half received trauma-focused CBT, while the others received the typical treatment offered at mental health clinics.

Many of the participants also had other significant mental health issues, such as depression or anxiety.

The results showed that while trauma-focused therapy was not dramatically better than standard treatment immediately after therapy, its benefits became clearer over time.

After 11 months, those who received trauma focused therapy showed significantly greater improvements in PTSD symptoms, anxiety, depression, and emotion regulation.

Researchers also noted that very few young people dropped out of the therapy, and there were no serious side effects, even though many participants had complex and severe symptoms.

Prof Meiser-Stedman said: ""These findings are really encouraging. They suggest that trauma focused therapy can be an effective and safe treatment for young people who have gone through more than one trauma, especially when they also have other mental health issues.

It also worked in real-world clinics, not just controlled research settings - so it's likely to help in everyday practice.

We hope our work will influence how PTSD is treated in young people across the UK and beyond, particularly those who've experienced repeated or long-term trauma.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","An AI assistant can interpret those lab results for you","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250915/An-AI-assistant-can-interpret-those-lab-results-for-you.aspx","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 10:40:00 GMT","

When Judith Miller had routine blood work done in July, she got a phone alert the same day that her lab results were posted online. So, when her doctor messaged her the next day that her overall tests were fine, Miller wrote back to ask about the elevated carbon dioxide and low anion gap listed in the report.

While the 76-year-old Milwaukee resident waited to hear back, Miller did something patients increasingly do when they can't reach their health care team. She put her test results into Claude and asked the AI assistant to evaluate the data.

""Claude helped give me a clear understanding of the abnormalities,"" Miller said. The generative AI model didn't report anything alarming, so she wasn't anxious while waiting to hear back from her doctor, she said.

Patients have unprecedented access to their medical records, often through online patient portals such as MyChart, because federal law requires health organizations to immediately release electronic health information, such as notes on doctor visits and test results. A study published in 2023 found that 96% of patients surveyed want immediate access to their records, even if their provider hasn't reviewed them.

And many patients are using large language models, or LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude, and Google's Gemini, to interpret their records. That help comes with some risk, though. Physicians and patient advocates warn that AI chatbots can produce wrong answers and that sensitive medical information might not remain private.

Yet, most adults are cautious about AI and health. Fifty-six percent of those who use or interact with AI are not confident that information provided by AI chatbots is accurate, according to a 2024 KFF poll. KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.

""LLMs are theoretically very powerful and they can give great advice, but they can also give truly terrible advice depending on how they're prompted,"" said Adam Rodman, an internist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Massachusetts and the chair of a steering group on generative AI at Harvard Medical School.

Justin Honce, a neuroradiologist at UCHealth in Colorado, said it can be very difficult for patients who are not medically trained to know whether AI chatbots make mistakes.

""Ultimately, it's just the need for caution overall with LLMs. With the latest models, these concerns are continuing to get less and less of an issue but have not been entirely resolved,"" Honce said.

Rodman has seen a surge in AI use among his patients in the past six months. In one case, a patient took a screenshot of his hospital lab results on MyChart then uploaded them to ChatGPT to prepare questions ahead of his appointment. Rodman said he welcomes patients' showing him how they use AI, and that their research creates an opportunity for discussion.

Roughly 1 in 7 adults over 50 use AI to receive health information, according to a recent poll from the University of Michigan, while 1 in 4 adults under age 30 do so, according to the KFF poll.

Using the internet to advocate for better care for oneself isn't new. Patients have traditionally used websites such as WebMD, PubMed, or Google to search for the latest research and have sought advice from other patients on social media platforms like Facebook or Reddit. But AI chatbots' ability to generate personalized recommendations or second opinions in seconds is novel.

Liz Salmi, communications and patient initiatives director at OpenNotes, an academic lab at Beth Israel Deaconess that advocates for transparency in health care, had wondered how good AI is at interpretation, specifically for patients.

In a proof-of-concept study published this year, Salmi and colleagues analyzed the accuracy of ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini responses to patients' questions about a clinical note. All three AI models performed well, but how patients framed their questions mattered, Salmi said. For example, telling the AI chatbot to take on the persona of a clinician and asking it one question at a time improved the accuracy of its responses.

Privacy is a concern, Salmi said, so it's critical to remove personal information like your name or Social Security number from prompts. Data goes directly to tech companies that have developed AI models, Rodman said, adding that he is not aware of any that comply with federal privacy law or consider patient safety. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, warned on a podcast last month about putting personal information into ChatGPT.

""Many people who are new to using large language models might not know about hallucinations,"" Salmi said, referring to a response that may appear sensible but is inaccurate. For example, OpenAI's Whisper, an AI-assisted transcription tool used in hospitals, introduced an imaginary medical treatment into a transcript, according to a report by The Associated Press.

Using generative AI demands a new type of digital health literacy that includes asking questions in a particular way, verifying responses with other AI models, talking to your health care team, and protecting your privacy online, said Salmi and Dave deBronkart, a cancer survivor and patient advocate who writes a blog devoted to patients' use of AI.

Patients aren't the only ones using AI to explain test results. Stanford Health Care has launched an AI assistant that helps its physicians draft interpretations of clinical tests and lab results to send to patients. Colorado researchers studied the accuracy of ChatGPT-generated summaries of 30 radiology reports, along with four patients' satisfaction with them. Of the 118 valid responses from patients, 108 indicated the ChatGPT summaries clarified details about the original report.

But ChatGPT sometimes overemphasized or underemphasized findings, and a small but significant number of responses indicated patients were more confused after reading the summaries, said Honce, who participated in the preprint study.

Meanwhile, after four weeks and a couple of follow-up messages from Miller in MyChart, Miller's doctor ordered a repeat of her blood work and an additional test that Miller suggested. The results came back normal. Miller was relieved and said she was better informed because of her AI inquiries.

""It's a very important tool in that regard,"" Miller said. ""It helps me organize my questions and do my research and level the playing field.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Why are more older people dying after falls?","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250915/Why-are-more-older-people-dying-after-falls.aspx","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 10:44:00 GMT","

For a while, walking the dog felt hazardous.

Earl Vickers was accustomed to taking Molly, his shepherd-boxer-something-else mix, for strolls on the beach or around his neighborhood in Seaside, California. A few years ago, though, he started to experience problems staying upright.

""If another dog came toward us, every single time I'd end up on the ground,"" recalled Vickers, 69, a retired electrical engineer. ""It seemed like I was falling every other month. It was kind of crazy.""

Most of those tumbles did no serious damage, though one time he fell backward and hit his head on a wall behind him. ""I don't think I had a concussion, but it's not something I want to do every day,"" Vickers said, ruefully. Another time, trying to break a fall, he broke two bones in his left hand.

So in 2022, he told the oncologist who had been treating him for prostate cancer that he wanted to stop the cancer drug he had been taking, off and on, for four years: enzalutamide (sold as Xtandi).

Among the drug's listed side effects are higher rates of falls and fractures among patients who took it, compared with those given a placebo. His doctor agreed that he could discontinue the drug, and ""I haven't had a single fall since,"" Vickers said.

Public health experts have warned of the perils of falls for older people for decades. In 2023, the most recent year of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 41,000 Americans over 65 died from falls, an opinion article in JAMA Health Forum pointed out last month.

More startling than that figure, though, was another statistic: Fall-related mortality among older adults has been climbing sharply.

The author, Thomas Farley, an epidemiologist, reported that death rates from fall injuries among Americans over 65 had more than tripled over the past 30 years. Among those over 85, the cohort at highest risk, death rates from falls jumped to 339 per 100,000 in 2023, from 92 per 100,000 in 1990.

The culprit, in his view, is Americans' reliance on prescription drugs.

""Older adults are heavily medicated, increasingly so, and with drugs that are inappropriate for older people,"" Farley said in an interview. ""This didn't occur in Japan or in Europe.""

Yet that same 30-year period saw a flurry of research and activity to try to reduce geriatric falls and their potentially devastating consequences, from hip fractures and brain bleeds to restricted mobility, persistent pain, and institutionalization.

The American Geriatrics Society adopted updated fall prevention guidelines in 2011. The CDC unveiled a program called STEADI in 2012. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommended exercise or physical therapy for older adults at risk of falling in 2012, 2018, and again last year.

""There've been studies and interventions and investments, and they haven't been particularly successful,"" said Donovan Maust, a geriatric psychiatrist and researcher at the University of Michigan. ""It's a bad problem that seems to be getting worse.""

But are prescription drugs driving that increase? Geriatricians and others who research falls and prescribing practices question that conclusion.

Farley, a former New York City health commissioner who teaches at Tulane University, acknowledged that many factors contribute to falls, including the physical impairments and deteriorating eyesight associated with advancing age; alcohol abuse; and tripping hazards in people's homes.

But ""there's no reason to think any of them have gotten three times worse in the past 30 years,"" he said, pointing to studies showing declines in other high-income countries.

The difference, he believes, is Americans' increasing use of medications — like benzodiazepines, opioids, antidepressants, and gabapentin — that act on the central nervous system.

""The drugs that increase falls' mortality are those that make you drowsy or dizzy,"" he said.

Problematic drugs are numerous enough to have acquired an acronym: FRIDs, or ""fall-risk-increasing drugs,"" a category that also includes various cardiac medications and early antihistamines like Benadryl.

Such medications play a major role, agreed Thomas Gill, a geriatrician and epidemiologist at Yale University and a longtime falls researcher. But, he said, ""there are alternative explanations"" for the increase in death rates.

He cited changes in reporting the causes of death, for instance. ""Years ago, falls were considered a natural consequence of aging and no big deal,"" he said.

Death certificates often attributed fatalities among older people to ailments like heart failure instead of falls, making fall mortality appear lower in the 1980s and 1990s.

Today's over-85 cohort may also be frailer and sicker than the oldest-old were 30 years ago, Gill added, because contemporary medicine can keep people alive longer.

Their accumulating impairments, more than the drugs they take, could make them more likely to die after a fall.

Another skeptic, Neil Alexander, a geriatrician and falls expert at the University of Michigan and VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, argued that most doctors have come to understand the dangers of FRIDs and prescribe them less often.

""Message delivered,"" he said. Given the alarms sounded about opioids, about benzodiazepines and related drugs, and especially about opioids and benzos together, ""a lot of primary care doctors have heard the gospel,"" he said. ""They know not to give older people Valium.""

Moreover, prescriptions for some fall-related drugs have already declined or hit plateaus, even as death rates because of falls have risen. Medicare data shows lower prescription opioid use beginning a decade ago, for example. Benzodiazepine prescriptions for older patients have slowed, Maust said.

On the other hand, the use of antidepressants and of gabapentin has increased.

Whether or not medication use outweighs all other factors, ""nobody disputes that these agents are overused and inappropriately used"" and contribute to the troubling increase in fall death rates among seniors, Gill said.

Thus, the ongoing campaign for ""deprescribing"" — stopping the medications whose potential harms outweigh their benefits, or reducing their dosage.

""We know a lot of these drugs can increase falls by 50 to 75%"" in older patients, said Michael Steinman, a geriatrician at the University of California-San Francisco and co-director of the US Deprescribing Research Network, established in 2019.

""It's easy to start meds, but it often takes a lot of time and effort to have patients stop taking them,"" he said. Harried doctors may pay less attention to drug regimens than to health issues that seem more pressing, and patients can be reluctant to give up pills that seem to help with pain, insomnia, reflux, and other common age-related complaints.

The Beers Criteria, a directory of drugs often deemed inadvisable for older adults, recently published recommendations for alternative medications and nonpharmacological treatments for frequent problems. Cognitive behavioral therapy for sleeplessness. Exercise, physical therapy, and psychological interventions for pain.

""It's a real tragedy when people have this life-altering event,"" Steinman, co-chair of the Beers panel on alternatives, said of falls. He urged older patients to raise the issue of FRIDs themselves, if their doctors haven't.

""Ask, 'Do any of my medications increase the risk of falls? Is there an alternative treatment?'"" he suggested. ""Being an informed patient or caregiver can put this on the agenda. Otherwise, it might not come up.""

Researchers have successfully used artificial intelligence (AI) to predict which patients need treatment to stabilize their corneas and preserve their eyesight, in a study presented today (Sunday) at the 43rd Congress of the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ESCRS).

The research focused on people with keratoconus, a visual impairment that generally develops in teenagers and young adults and tends to worsen into adulthood. It affects up to 1 in 350 people. In some cases, the condition can be managed with contact lenses, but in others it deteriorates quickly and if it is not treated, patients may need a corneal transplant. Currently the only way to tell who needs treatment is to monitor patients over time.

The researchers used AI to assess images of patients' eyes, combined with other data, and to successfully predict which patients needed prompt treatment and which could continue with monitoring.

The study was by Dr. Shafi Balal and colleagues at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, and University College London (UCL), UK. He said: ""In people with keratoconus, the cornea – the eye's front window – bulges outwards. Keratoconus causes visual impairment in young, working-age patients and it is the most common reason for corneal transplantation in the Western world.

""A single treatment called 'cross-linking' can halt disease progression. When performed before permanent scarring develops, cross-linking often prevents the need for corneal transplantation. However, doctors cannot currently predict which patients will progress and require treatment, and which will remain stable with monitoring alone. This means patients need frequent monitoring over many years, with cross-linking typically performed after progression has already occurred.""

The study involved a group of patients who were referred to Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust for keratoconus assessment and monitoring, including scanning the front of the eye with optical coherence tomography (OCT) to examine its shape. Researchers used AI to study 36,673 OCT images of 6,684 different patients along with other patient data.

The AI algorithm could accurately predict whether a patient's condition would deteriorate or remain stable using images and data from the first visit alone. Using AI, the researchers could sort two-thirds of patients into a low-risk group, who did not need treatment, and the other third into a high-risk group, who needed prompt cross-linking treatment. When information from a second hospital visit was included, the algorithm could successfully categorise up to 90% of patients.

Cross linking treatment uses ultraviolet light and vitamin B2 (riboflavin) drops to stiffen the cornea, and it is successful in more than 95% of cases.

Our research shows that we can use AI to predict which patients need treatment and which can continue with monitoring. This is the first study of its kind to obtain this level of accuracy in predicting the risk of keratoconus progression from a combination of scans and patient data, and it uses a large cohort of patients monitored over two years or more. Although this study is limited to using one specific OCT device, the research methods and AI algorithm used can be applied to other devices. The algorithm will now undergo further safety testing before it is deployed in the clinical setting.

Our results could mean that patients with high-risk keratoconus will be able to receive preventative treatment before their condition progresses. This will prevent vision loss and avoid the need for corneal transplant surgery with its associated complications and recovery burden. Low-risk patients will avoid unnecessary frequent monitoring, freeing up healthcare resources. The effective sorting of patients by the algorithm will allow specialists to be redirected to areas with the greatest need.""

Dr. Shafi Balal, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust

The researchers are now developing a more powerful AI algorithm, trained on millions of eye scans, that can be tailored for specific tasks, including predicting keratoconus progression, but also other tasks such as detecting eye infections and inherited eye diseases.

Dr. José Luis Güell, ESCRS Trustee and Head of the Cornea, Cataract and Refractive Surgery Department at the Instituto de Microcirugía Ocular, Barcelona, Spain, who was not involved in the research, said: ""Keratoconus is a manageable condition, but knowing who to treat, and when and how to give treatment is challenging. Unfortunately, this problem can lead to delays, with many patients experiencing vision loss and requiring invasive implant or transplant surgery.

""This research suggests that we can use AI to help predict who will progress, even from their first routine consultation, meaning we could treat patients early before progression and secondary changes. Equally, we could reduce unnecessary monitoring of patients whose condition is stable. If it consistently demonstrates its effectiveness, this technology would ultimately prevent vision loss and more difficult management strategies in young, working-age patients.""

College students with major depression who followed a ketogenic diet for 10–12 weeks saw rapid improvements in mood, well-being, and cognition, pointing to diet as a powerful ally in mental health care.

Study: A pilot study examining a ketogenic diet as an adjunct therapy in college students with major depressive disorder. Image credit: PeopleImages/Shutterstock.com

Ketogenic (“keto”) diets have become popular among the population to improve metabolic health. A paper published in Translational Psychiatry examines whether this could add value to the management of depression.

Major depression affects both adults and young people, being reported in up to 5% of adults worldwide. College campuses have seen increasing rates of depression. While behavioral and psychotherapy strategies are in use, either for individuals or groups, medications are often added. However, these may cause decreased libido, increased anxiety, and metabolic complications, potentially worsening depressive symptoms.

Obesity or being overweight increases the odds of depression. Dietary factors may lead to dysregulated metabolism, which may trigger or worsen inflammation, another risk factor for depression. This has prompted research on the potential impact of dietary interventions on depression.

The keto diet has improved metabolic health, especially for people with insulin resistance or obesity. A well-formulated ketogenic diet (WFKD) provides <50 g/day of carbohydrates, 1.5 g/kg/day of protein, and fat to induce satiety. The aim is to induce nutritional ketosis, with energy obtained chiefly from fatty acids and ketone bodies.

A WFKD may reduce inflammation, improve brain chemicals that stimulate positive mood and learning, regulate body fat, and stabilize neurotransmission. The current study sought to understand if a WFKD would work for most college students, help improve metabolic health, and alleviate symptoms of depression.

The researchers looked at 24 students who had major depression at the beginning of the study. All were receiving counseling with or without pharmaceutical treatment when enrolled in the keto diet intervention for 10-12 weeks. They were first educated about the diet to ensure higher compliance.

The participants were also coached after the study began. They were provided with several keto-friendly meals at the outset to help them understand how to pick foods for the rest of the study period at their homes. Some additional ketogenic foods, such as olive oil, packaged salmon and sardines, or beef jerky, were also provided to help cut food costs. Broth or other electrolyte packs were given to prevent sodium and fluid depletion, a common accompaniment of such diets.

They were instructed to be aware that cramps could occur and could be offset by increasing their magnesium and calcium intake through their diet. Their blood was monitored every morning for capillary levels of the metabolite capillary R-beta-hydroxybutyrate (R-BHB). 

Of the 24 enrolled, 16 completed the study, with most dropouts occurring for reasons unrelated to the diet itself. This represented an attrition rate of about 33%, with some students leaving due to stress or semester scheduling conflicts.

In the 16 students who completed the study, ketosis was achieved 73% of the time. R-BHB levels were maintained at the appropriate levels, while blood glucose levels were normal.

Symptoms of depression showed a ~70% reduction on average after the study. While two participants had medication adjustments, analysis showed no significant interaction between medication status and depression outcomes. However, the ketone levels were not correlated with the improvement in symptoms.

Most students began to feel better within 2-6 weeks. They reported an overall improvement in their well-being by threefold, as measured using the WHO-5 well-being index. By the end of the study, WHO-5 scores had nearly tripled compared to baseline, reflecting a substantial gain in overall quality of life.

There was a 32% increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a brain chemical that is reduced in certain key brain areas in depression but is increased by β-hydroxybutyrate.

Participants lost an average of five kilograms of body mass, and almost all experienced clinically relevant weight loss. On average, their body composition improved, with 6% of their body mass and 13% of their fat mass lost. There was no correlation between body weight changes and symptomatic improvement.

Metabolic markers remained largely unchanged, but urea and calcium increased. In addition, serum leptin decreased by about 52%, and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels declined, consistent with improved metabolic regulation. Cognitive improvement was also observed across multiple domains, including auditory, processing speed, flexibility, and accuracy.

The strongest improvements were in auditory verbal learning, processing speed, and executive functions, with other domains unchanged. The authors note, however, that practice effects from repeated testing could partly explain these gains, and that improvements may also be linked to reduced depressive symptoms and better metabolic regulation.

“This pilot study provides preliminary evidence that a WFKD is a feasible and synergistic strategy adjunctive to a counseling and consultation treatment program for young adults with MDD.”

However, the study did not have a control group, so improvements cannot be attributed solely to diet rather than counseling, medication, or time. Future research should embrace a broader and more diverse participant group, but health awareness, financial constraints, and the accessibility of dietary counseling could influence the feasibility of such interventions.

When applying this type of dietary intervention beyond college students, especially in settings where health literacy, financial barriers, or limited access to dietary counseling may pose challenges, messaging apps and providing individualized support may help improve outcomes.

The authors also caution that college students may have unique advantages, such as easier access to resources and support, which may not apply to other populations, and that adherence to the diet could be more difficult in groups without comparable structure or support.

A Danish national registry trial shows the RSVpreF vaccine is highly effective at preventing severe RSV illness and related hospitalizations in older adults, offering real-world support for broader immunization strategies.



Study: RSV Prefusion F Vaccine for Prevention of Hospitalization in Older Adults. Image Credit: CI Photos / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, researchers investigated the efficacy of the novel bivalent RSV prefusion F protein-based vaccine (RSVpreF) in preventing severe symptomatic Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infections, particularly in older adults (60 years and older).

The study leveraged an extensive (131,000 participants), open-label, pragmatic randomized trial conducted in Denmark during the 2024–2025 winter season. Participants aged 60 and above were primarily recruited via digital invitations through the national registry infrastructure. The trial was designed to reflect real-world conditions, utilizing broad eligibility criteria and integrating administrative health registries for recruitment, randomization (1:1 – vaccine vs. no trial-administered vaccine), and outcome tracking.

Findings revealed that the vaccine was 83.3% effective at preventing rigorously defined RSV-related hospitalizations (based on ICD-10 codes or positive tests within 7 days of admission) and 91.7% effective against RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease hospitalizations, confirming its role in protecting older populations within a real-world trial framework.

Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that, while common across age groups, can cause severe respiratory illness in infants and older adults, often leading to hospitalization of the latter. Reports highlight an estimated 470,000 hospitalizations and 33,000 deaths in adults aged 60 or more annually in industrialized nations. Despite this burden, routine RSV testing remains limited, potentially underestimating true incidence.

Titled A Pragmatic Randomized Trial to Evaluate Bivalent RSV Prefusion F Protein–based Vaccine Effectiveness for Preventing RSV Hospitalizations in Adults Aged 60 Years or Above (DAN-RSV), the trial randomly assigned 131,276 adults in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the RSVpreF vaccine or no trial-administered vaccine (control group). Notably, 1.2% of controls sought RSV vaccination outside the trial. The study's primary endpoint was hospitalization for RSV-related respiratory tract disease, defined using national registry data through ICD-10 codes or a positive RSV test within 7 days before or after admission. Key secondary endpoints included hospitalization for RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease and hospitalization for respiratory tract disease from any cause, tested hierarchically after the primary endpoint.

The study's findings demonstrated significant efficacy, with only three hospitalizations for RSV-related respiratory tract disease in the 65,642 participants who received the vaccine, compared to 18 hospitalizations in the 65,634 participants in the control group. Fewer events occurred than expected, partly due to reduced RSV testing in Denmark following the COVID-19 pandemic.

These findings translate to a vaccine effectiveness of 83.3% (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 42.9–96.9), exceeding the prespecified success criterion of 20% (p = 0.007). The vaccine also showed benefit against broader outcomes: 91.7% efficacy against RSV-related lower respiratory tract hospitalization (1 vs. 12 events; 95% CI, 43.7–99.8; p=0.009); a 15.2% reduction in any respiratory tract disease hospitalization (284 vs. 335; 95% CI, 0.5–27.9; p=0.04), though this secondary endpoint was not adjusted for multiplicity after hierarchical testing; and a 9.9% reduction in cardiorespiratory hospitalizations (exploratory). The greater absolute reduction in hospitalizations for respiratory disease from any cause (compared to confirmed RSV cases) suggests that the vaccine prevented many hospitalizations where RSV infection went undiagnosed due to limited testing.

The incidence of serious adverse events was similar between the two groups within 6 weeks of vaccination. Five vaccine-related SAEs occurred (including pericarditis and Bell's palsy), and a non-significant mortality imbalance emerged by season's end (146 vs. 120 deaths).

The study provides robust evidence from a pragmatic trial that RSVpreF significantly reduces RSV-related hospitalizations in adults aged 60 and older. By leveraging a large-scale, open-label design and national registries, the study addresses limitations of earlier trials. While potential healthy-volunteer bias and undertesting of RSV remain caveats, the vaccine demonstrated protection against severe outcomes with a manageable safety profile.

New genetic evidence suggests that targeting GIPR and GLP1R could reduce harmful drinking patterns while improving liver and metabolic health, opening the door to repurposing existing metabolic drugs for alcohol use disorders.



Study: Genetically modeled GLP1R and GIPR agonism reduce binge drinking and alcohol-associated phenotypes: a multi-ancestry drug-target Mendelian randomization study. Image Credit: Voyagerix / Shutterstock

A recent study published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry investigated whether genetically proxied agonism of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) influences alcohol use disorder (AUD) and problematic alcohol use (PAU) behaviors.

The therapeutic potential of GLP1R agonists and dual GIPR/GLP1R agonists (henceforth, GIPR/GLP1R) extends beyond metabolic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. Growing evidence suggests that these therapies may also address AUD and substance use disorders (SUDs). GLP1R agonists have been promising in decreasing drug and alcohol intake.

Preclinical evidence indicates GIPR agonism influences weight regulation and glucose metabolism. Further, genetic variants in GIPR are linked to alcohol dependence, highlighting its relevance in addiction biology. Moreover, GIPR/GLP1R agonists exhibit superior metabolic efficacy than GLP1R agonists alone, underscoring the potential synergistic effects of targeting both.

The present study assessed whether genetically proxied GLP1R and GIPR agonism influences AUD and PAU behaviors using drug-target Mendelian randomization (MR). GIPR and GLP1R were instrumented using body mass index (BMI) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) data, as these traits capture the core effects of their agonists.

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within 500 kilobases of the GLP1R locus and associated with HbA1c levels in European ancestry participants of the United Kingdom Biobank (UKB) were used to investigate GLP1R agonism. GLP1R and GIPR instruments were separately developed using BMI genome-wide association study (GWAS) data.

BMI and HbA1c instruments for GIPR and GLP1R were aggregated into single instruments capturing both loci to model the effects of GIPR/GLP1R agonists. To validate instruments, their associations with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) were examined for each exposure. Further, the proportion of individuals carrying at least one activation allele at GLP1R and GIPR loci was estimated in European, African, and East Asian populations. Findings were replicated in independent datasets, supported by colocalization analyses, and tested with multiple sensitivity instruments to strengthen causal inference.

A comprehensive set of alcohol-related outcomes was curated to assess the therapeutic potential of GIPR and GLP1R agonism. The primary analysis focused on PAU; in addition, distinct alcohol intake behaviors were examined.

Drinks-per-week results were largely null in European ancestry participants, suggesting effects may concentrate on binge/heavy patterns. Moreover, alcohol misuse classes identified through latent class analysis of over 410,000 UKB participants were incorporated to explore in-depth how GIPR and GLP1R activity may differentially affect drinking behaviors.

Relationships with other SUDs, including cannabis (CUD), opioid (OUD), and tobacco (TUD) use disorders, and food liking behaviors were also investigated. Further, six liver-related outcomes were analyzed; these were alcohol-related liver disease (ALD), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and liver enzymes: alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase.



This study used summary-level GWAS data relating to glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and body mass index (BMI) to construct genetic instruments modeling GLP1R and GIPR agonism. We constructed three instrument types: one that proxies GLP1R agonism, one that proxies GIPR agonism, and one combined instrument that proxies dual GLP1R and GIPR agonism. Each instrument type included multiple exposure sources mimicking the expected physiological responses to pharmacological modulation of the targets (lowered glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], reduced body mass index [BMI], and GLP1R or GIPR gene expression in the cortex). Instrument sets for each BMI and HbA1c exposure were constructed in two independent GWAS summary statistics (UK Biobank [plus GIANT for BMI] and the Million Veterans Program [MVP]). After instrumentation and validation with the primary clinical indications for GLP1R and GIPR agonism (type 2 diabetes and obesity), and assessing their impact on liver health, we obtained a selection of outcomes related to alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol consumption behavior to assess the impact of GLP1R and GIPR agonism. We contextualized the alcohol-related analyses by analyzing other substance use disorders and investigating outcomes related to self-reported food liking. Because of the availability of large sample sizes and the most relevant endpoints, we used data from European ancestry as the main analysis set, but we also performed analyses using East Asian and African ancestry data sources. Finally, for all drug-target MR estimates demonstrating evidence of a relationship (main drug-target MR method P < 0.05), we performed colocalization analyses to assess evidence of shared causal variants between the biomarker exposures and outcomes in the GLP1R and GIPR genomic loci. MR Mendelian Randomization, GLP1R Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor, GIPR glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor, NAFLD Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, ALD Alcohol-related liver disease, SNP Single nucleotide polymorphism, BMI Body mass index. 

For GLP1R agonism, genetically proxied reductions in BMI via GLP1R showed consistent associations with a decreased risk of obesity; lower HbA1c levels were also associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D).

For GIPR agonism, genetically proxied reductions in BMI by GIPR variants were robustly associated with a lower obesity risk; lower HbA1c levels via GIPR were similarly protective against type 2 diabetes (T2D). For GIPR/GLP1R agonism, lower BMI through both receptor activation substantially reduces the risk of obesity.

Similarly, lower HbA1c levels via the GIPR/GLP1R loci were associated with a lower risk of T2D. Receptor-activating alleles at both GLP1R and GIPR loci showed high prevalence across populations. However, modest ancestry-specific variation was evident. Further, there was evidence for lower binge drinking linked to BMI lowering through GIPR/GLP1R. Consistent reductions were observed with BMI lowering through GIPR alone, but not with GLP1R.

Further, genetically lowered HbA1c via GIPR/GLP1R was associated with 38% reduced odds of broad heavy drinking with psychiatric comorbidities compared to light drinking behavior. When analyzed separately, both GLP1R and GIPR also showed protective associations with heavy-risk drinking classes. CUD, OUD, and TUD analyses provided consistent null results.

However, genetically lowered BMI via GIPR/GLP1R showed robust associations with food preferences, especially vegetarian and fatty foods. BMI lowering via GIPR/GLP1R was associated with a lower preference for fatty foods and an increased preference for vegetarian foods. These effects were primarily driven by GIPR and were stronger for BMI-linked instruments than for HbA1c. HbA1c lowering via GIPR/GLP1R also exhibited beneficial relationships with a liking for vegetarian food, albeit this impact was less consistent and generally weaker.

HbA1c lowering by GIPR/GLP1R variants was associated with lower NAFLD, and GIPR primarily drove this relationship. No association was observed for alcohol-related liver disease (ALD). Notably, GIPR or GLP1R showed no relationship with ALD. Further, HbA1c lowering via GIPR/GLP1R was consistently associated with lower ALT and GGT, which were mainly driven by GIPR. BMI lowering by GIPR variants also showed similar protective relationships with liver enzymes.

Given the robust protective associations with heavy drinking behavior and documented links between cardiovascular disease and these behaviors, the researchers used two-step MR to investigate whether alcohol intake reductions mediate the cardioprotective effects of GLP1R and GIPR agonism on coronary artery disease (CAD) risk.

This study showed that lowering BMI via GIPR/GLP1R reduces CAD risk, whereas binge drinking increases the risk, and that approximately 12.6% of the GIPR/GLP1R effect and 12.2% of the GIPR effect on CAD risk were mediated through reduced binge drinking.

Exploratory analyses in non-European cohorts were underpowered and largely directionally consistent, so firm locus-specific conclusions could not be drawn.

In summary, the results highlight the therapeutic potential of GIPR and GLP1R agonism, particularly in targeting GIPR/GLP1R, in improving liver health and reducing PAU behaviors. The observed benefits underscore the potential of these agents to address the burden of AUDs and metabolic comorbidities.

The authors interpret BMI-anchored associations as more consistent with behavioral or CNS-linked pathways, and HbA1c-anchored associations as more consistent with metabolic pathways, while noting that mechanistic confirmation requires clinical trials. The study also notes that genetic models cannot capture drug-specific effects, underscoring the need for future clinical trials to test translation.

When Chelle Adams retired for the second time, she thought it was for real. She was fresh off a yearlong stint in the C-suite at SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, and had previously served as chief financial officer for The Cosmopolitan resort casino and hotel in Las Vegas, helping to transform the property and position it for a record-setting $5.65 billion sale in 2022. 

“One of the SeaWorld board members reached out and asked what I was going to do next,” Adams recalled. “I said, ‘Yeah, I'm not. I am going to retire this time. I'm going to spend time with my kids. I've worked a lot and hard, and I want to make sure that I can be that soccer mom for my little guy who's not so little anymore.” 

Her second retirement ended after about three months, when a recruiter came to her about the CFO position at the U.S. Soccer Federation. It was a perfect fit for Adams, who grew up playing soccer with the boys in Oklahoma when there wasn't a girls team and, later in life, coached both of her kids. 

“Soccer and the mission at U.S. Soccer — all the stars aligned,” Adams said. 

Since joining in 2023, Adams has been focused on funding the construction of the Arthur M. Blank U.S. Soccer National Training Center, a $225 million facility in the Atlanta area, and building a sustainable financial future for the once-troubled nonprofit organization. 

She led the federation's first bond raise last year, which attracted more than $3.2 billion in initial orders, and has helped the organization achieve surpluses in the 2024 and 2025 fiscal years after posting a $40 million deficit in 2023. Now, she is working to set up an endowment that will put the organization's recent influx of funding to work through prudent investment.

Why she's a Game Changer

Adams leads the team that is funding the Arthur M. Blank U.S. Soccer National Training Center, the future home of soccer in America that is set to open in spring of 2026.

NWSL

A National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) match between Racing Louisville and the Seattle Reign was postponed Sunday after a medical emergency involving Savannah DeMelo. The Racing midfielder received medical care on the field before being transported to a local hospital for further evaluation, according to the team. Her condition is stable, and she is alert.

The game will be rescheduled for a later date and start from the minute it was abandoned. Louisville said it would provide an update as appropriate.

The 27-year-old sat down in the 47th minute and appeared to fall backward shortly before medical staff from both teams arrived to attend to her on the field. Several Racing teammates looked visibly upset. As teams retreated to their benches, the match was immediately delayed, followed by an announcement of an early halftime.

“Our first priority is (DeMelo's) health and safety, and we are in close communication with Reigh FC and Racing Louisville's medical teams,” the NWSL said in a statement. “We recognize the concern this incident may cause, particularly in light of recent conversations around player safety.

“The NWSL remains committed to ensuring that the highest standards of medical care and emergency response are in place at every match.”

Broadcasters Jordan Angeli and Maura Sheridan, who were calling the game for CBS on Paramount+, later announced that DeMelo had been transported to the hospital in an ambulance. About 10 minutes later, they shared that the match had officially been abandoned and would resume at a later date determined by the league. The two teams were level in a scoreless draw before the game's postponement.

“Postponing the match was the right decision, as nothing is more important than the safety of Players and staff on the field,” a statement from the NWSL's player association reads. “This is a challenging time for all those affected, and we ask for continued respect of everyone's privacy.”

DeMelo revealed in May that she had been diagnosed with Graves' disease and hyperthyroidism last fall. Her statement came following a medical incident on March 22, when Racing played Bay FC in San Jose. During that match, Demelo reported feeling tightness in her chest and dizziness. She sat down and informed the referee of her condition and was soon stretchered off the field and taken to a nearby hospital.

“Playing a 90-minute game felt unbearable,” DeMelo told ESPN in May. “I would get to maybe the 25th minute, and I felt like my heart was just like beating so fast, like out of my chest. I felt so out of breath, so out of shape. I didn't really know what was going on.”

DeMelo added that she was prescribed medication that lowers her heart rate and slows down her thyroid after receiving her diagnosis, symptoms of which include rapid heart rate and weight loss. The incident that occurred when Racing played Bay FC in March was due to DeMelo's heart rate measuring below what is required to compete in a high-level soccer game, an imbalance that was later found to be related to her medication.

In 2023, DeMelo became one of just three U.S. women's national team players named to a World Cup roster without having previously earned a single cap. Known for her ability to unlock opponents' midfields and draw fouls in advantageous positions, DeMelo has also proven herself critical to Racing Louisville, which entered its match against Seattle eighth in the NWSL table with a shot at making the playoffs for the first time in club history. As Racing's No. 4 pick in the 2022 NWSL draft, DeMelo is the club leader in goals with 17 and assists with eight.

Sunday's postponement comes four months after a medical incident involving Angel City FC defender Savy King took place in Los Angeles during a match, which was resumed shortly after King was transported to the hospital.

King was later diagnosed with a heart abnormality that required her to undergo surgery. The 20-year-old, who is in her second year as a professional, was discharged roughly one week later and is currently on medical leave.

The question of whether to postpone or proceed with matches has been an increasingly fraught issue this season, and is not limited to medical emergencies involving individual players.

On Aug. 16, a match between the Kansas City Current and Orlando Pride continued after it had been delayed nearly 3.5 hours due to extreme heat. NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman threatened to fine the Current, who hosted the match, during a disagreement over the protocols.

According to the 2025 NWSL competition rules, the league “recognizes that emergencies may arise which make the start or progression of a game inadvisable or dangerous for participants and spectators. Certain event categories automatically trigger the league office into an evaluation of whether delay or postponement is necessary, including … serious incident, injury or fatality to a player, coach, official, team representative or spectator or other medical concern.”

The rules also state that matches “shall be postponed without the permission of the commissioner or a league-designated representative, unless such postponement is mandated by law enforcement.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","USWNT's Savannah DeMelo Suffers ""Medical Emergency"" Mid-Game","https://www.eonline.com/news/1422541/savannah-demelo-suffers-medical-emergency-during-soccer-game","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:32:00 GMT","

Savannah DeMelo collapsed on the field a few minutes into her team Racing Louisville's game against Seattle Reign on Sept. 14. The U.S. women's national soccer team player is now stable and alert.

Savannah DeMelo experienced a health scare on the field.

The Racing Louisville midfielder collapsed just a few minutes into her soccer team's Sept. 14 match against Seattle Reign at Lumen Field in Seatle.

The 27-year-old, who also plays for the United States Women's National Team, could be seen slowly sitting down on the field with a teammate by her side, per Reuters, as the referee called for trainers to check her out. She collapsed seconds later.

“Tonight's match between Seattle Reign FC and Racing Louisville FC has been abandoned following a medical emergency involving Racing Louisville midfielder Savannah DeMelo,” the National Women's Soccer League wrote on X later that night. “Savannah received immediate on-field care from medical personnel and was transported to a local hospital for further evaluation.”

“She is stable and alert,” the statement continued. “Our first priority is her health and safety, and we are in close communication with Racing Louisville's medical team.”

As for the game? The remainders will be played on a date mutually agreed on by both teams. And until then, the opposing team extended a message of support.

""We stand side by side with Louisville during this time,” the Seattle Reign wrote in a Sept. 14 statement, “and thank our fans for their support.”

DeMelo's latest health scare comes six months after she was stretchered off the field during her team's road game against Bay FC due to dizziness and chest tightness.

Two months later, she shared that she had been diagnosed with Graves' disease and hyperthyroidism.

""Playing a 90-minute game felt unbearable,"" she told ESPN in May. ""I would get to maybe the 25th minute, and I felt like my heart was just like beating so fast, like out of my chest. I felt so out of breath, so out of shape. I didn't really know what was going on.""

Graves' disease is an immune system condition that affects the thyroid gland and causes the body to make too much thyroid hormone, per the Mayo Clinic. And while DeMelo knew she hadn't quite been feeling like herself before receiving her diagnosis, she assumed it was due to lack of sleep.

""I said things like, 'Oh, maybe I need to sleep more. Maybe we were traveling a lot. Maybe I'm not eating enough protein,'” she recalled. “I kind of went through that for a while.”

But since receiving an official diagnosis for her thyroid problems, which cause symptoms like rapid heart rate and weight loss, DeMelo has been able to better understand the affects her condition have on her playing abilities.

""I think it was more the energy piece of it, the ability to make those runs, the ability to, when I get the ball, not be so fatigued that I can make clear decisions and be decisive and just provide energy,” she explained. “I think I'm a player that likes to go forward, get back in defense, like, I'm kind of everywhere. And I feel like I really couldn't do that because I was truly exhausted.""

Nikki Garcia's Breast Implant Injury

The Total Bellas alum revealed that one of her breast implants shifted after an elbow slam from fellow WWE star Piper Niven during a July 2025 wrestling match.

""It's OK,"" she told sister Bella Garcia at the time. ""We're going to get it fixed one day. I told the doctor, I go, 'Newly divorced, so the minute the boots are hung up, I'm going to come back to you and we're going to make these girls look real good, because these girls are going to get some action in the future and that can't look like that.'""

Lupita Nyong'o's Uterine Fibroids

The 12 Years a Slave star was diagnosed with uterine fibroids—non-cancerous growths that develop in or around the uterus—in 2014, the same year she won an Oscar for performance in the movie.

However, it wasn't until 2025 when she disclosed her diagnosis, writing on Instagram that she had been ""suffering in silence"" for more than a decade.

""When we reach puberty, we're taught periods mean pain, and that pain is simply part of being a woman,"" she shared. ""We're struggling alone with something that affects us most.""

 

Suki Waterhouse's Hernia

In July 2025, the Daisy Jones & The Six star shared that she had been hospitalized due to a hernia—a gap in the muscular wall that's commonly found in the abdomen or groin area—caused by wearing tight pants.

Brian Austin Green's Perforated Appendix

The Beverly Hills, 90210 alum revealed in April 2025 that he was recovering from surgery after his appendix nearly burst.

“Last week, I started feeling some pain in my stomach,” Brian said in an Instagram video at the time. “I ended up going to the emergency room, and I had a perforated appendix. Not quite burst, but just before.”

He added, “I'm on the road to recovery. It's not an easy process. This is my first major surgery.”

Adam Devine shared that injuries he sustained after getting hit by a cement truck when he was 11 years old are still affecting him to this day. 

“It's been a nightmare,” Devine said in a 2025 episode of the In Depth With Graham Bensinger podcast. “I have spasms all over. For a while, [the doctors] told me I was dying—literally, within this last year.”

He noted that pain comes and goes, adding, ""My body has all these things that are a little wonky and a little wrong with it.""

Jason Tartick's Back Injury

The Bachelor Nation alum shared that he went to the hospital “crawling on all fours” due to overwhelming back pain that was aggravated during an RV trip with a friend.  

“Right now, knees to my toes, it's, like, still tingly, which is crazy,” he said on a March 2025 episode of his Trading Secrets podcast. “And to put in perspective, I don't know, man, like not to sound douchey, but like two, three weeks ago, maybe a month ago, I was squatting probably like 295 pounds. And right now, I can't do a squat on my foot. I can't do a one legged squat, I fall. It's like I had a stroke or something.”

But with the help of a back specialist and some steroids, he added, “We're on the mend.”

Christy Carlson Romano's Eye Injury

The Even Stevens alum shared in February 2025 that she was shot in the face while on a trip to shoot clay pigeons to celebrate husband Brendan Rooney's birthday.

""There was another party with us and they unsafely fired in the wrong direction and shot me in the face,"" she wrote on Instagram. ""@thebrendanrooney immediately sprung into action, assessed me, and rushed me to the hospital. I was hit in 5 places, one was less than an inch from hitting me directly in my right eye.""

The Kim Possible alum continued, ""Unfortunately a fragment got lodged behind my eye and it is too risky to remove surgically at this time. Doctors will continue to monitor me (I can see normally at the moment).""

The actress said she was grateful to be alive. ""I love my daughters, husband, family, and friends so much,"" she said. ""I saw my life flash before my eyes and I'm telling you, hug the people around you every chance you can. Life can change in an instant.""

Amy Schumer's Cushing Syndrome

While the internet isn't always a kind place, Amy Schumer is happy that, in this case, it helped her get answers.""The internet really came for me after doing a bunch of press, and I was like, 'OK everybody, relax,'"" Amy recalled of her ""puffier"" face on a January 2025 episode of Call Her Daddy. ""But then doctors were chiming in in the comments and they were like, 'No no, we think something's really up. Your face looks so crazy that we think something's up. And I'm like, ‘Wait, I'm getting trolled by doctors?'""After these doctors said they thought she had Cushing syndrome and that it may be caused by spiking coritsol levels or steroid injections, the Life & Beth creator thought, ""Wait, I have been getting steroid injections in my scars.""I had a breast reduction, a C-section, whatever, and so I was getting these steroid injections,"" Amy said. ""So it gave me this thing called Cushing syndrome, which I wouldn't have known if the internet hadn't come for me so hard.""Toda, Amy is just relieved she's OK. As she shared in a February 2024 News Not Noise newsletter, ""Finding out I have the kind of Cushing that will just work itself out and I'm healthy was the greatest news imaginable.""

Hailey Bieber's Blood Clot

Hailey Bieber had the ""scariest moment"" of her life when she was having breakfast with husband Justin Bieber and started experiencing stroke-like symptoms in March 2022.""Justin was like, 'Are you OK?'"" the Rhode skincare mogul shared a month later on YouTube, ""and I just didn't respond because I wasn't sure. And then he asked me again and when I went to respond, I couldn't speak. The right side of my face started drooping. I couldn't get a sentence out.""While Hailey said the facial drooping stopped and her speech came back, she went to the hospital to make sure she was OK.""They did some scans and they were able to see that I had suffered a small blood clot to my brain,"" the model added, ""which they labeled and categorized as something called a TIA [Transient Ischemic Attack].""Later, Hailey went to the University of California, Los Angeles, where she found out she had a hole in her heart called a patent foramen ovale (PFO).She explained the blood clot had traveled into her heart, ""escaped"" through the hole and went to her brain, leading to the TIA.Hailey said she had a successful PFO closure procedure and was now feeling great.

Justin Bieber's Ramsay Hunt Syndrome

The same year Hailey had her health scare, Justin experienced one of his own.In June 2022, the ""Baby"" singer shared he was diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, a condition that caused temporary paralysis to parts of his face and forced him to cancel the remainder of his Justice World Tour.""It is from this virus that attacks the nerve in my ear and my facial nerves and has caused my face to have paralysis,"" Justin explained in an Instagram video at the time. ""As you can see, this eye is not blinking. I can't smile on this side of my face. This nostril will not move. So, there's full paralysis on this side of my face.""In fact, he told his followers it had gotten ""progressively harder to eat."" But after a while, the paralysis went away.""He's doing really well,"" Hailey said on a June 2022 episode of Good Morning America, later adding, ""He's feeling a lot better. Obviously, it was just a very scary and random situation to happen, but he's going to be totally OK and I'm just grateful that he's fine."" 

Jamie Foxx's Brain Bleed & Stroke

While Jamie Foxx initially kept details of his April 2023 hospitalization private, he later opened up about what he went through.One day in Atlanta, ""I was having such a bad headache, so I asked my boy, I said, ‘Listen, I need an aspirin,'” the Oscar winner said in his 2024 Netflix special What Had Happened Was... “Before I could get the Aspirin, I went out. I don't remember 20 days.”Jamie said he was initially taken to a doctor who gave him a cortisone shot and then sent him home. However, his concerned sister Deidra Dixon then drove him to a hospital, where they got an answer: He had a brain bleed that led to a stroke.Twenty days after undergoing an operation, the Django Unchained woke up May 4 in a wheelchair and couldn't walk. He then went to Chicago for rehabilitation and therapy.""All I can tell you is that I appreciate every prayer,” he said, “because I needed every prayer.”

Tracey Yukich's Medical Emergency on The Biggest Loser

The reality star revealed that she ""died"" while running a mile during the first challenge of the NBC competition series. 

“I don't remember a lot,” she explained on Fit for TV: The Reality of The Biggest Loser. “I remember hearing the helicopter. I just felt like I was floating. And then my grandpa was there. And then I saw darkness. But then I saw light. So I knew, I knew I died that day.”

“My organs were literally shutting down,” she continued. “I didn't realize that I had rhabdomyolysis. And rhabdomyolysis is your body's way of saying, ‘I'm going to shut down on you.'”

Emilia Clarke's Brain Aneurysm

Emilia Clarke filmed battle scenes for Game of Thrones, but in 2019, she published an essay in The New Yorker titled ""A Battle for My Life.""Having a bad headache at the gym, ""I reached the toilet, sank to my knees, and proceeded to be violently, voluminously ill,"" the actress wrote. ""Meanwhile, the pain—shooting, stabbing, constricting pain—was getting worse. At some level, I knew what was happening: my brain was damaged.""She was taken to the hospital for a brain scan.""The diagnosis was quick and ominous: a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a life-threatening type of stroke, caused by bleeding into the space surrounding the brain,"" the Emmy nominee added. ""I'd had an aneurysm, an arterial rupture.""Emilia had immediate surgery to seal the aneurysm, calling the pain ""unbearable."" While she was recovering, she continued, she experienced aphasia and was ""muttering nonsense.""A week later, ""the aphasia passed,"" Emilia added, and she left the hospital a month after being admitted. At a 2013 brain scan, she learned a growth ""doubled in size"" and that she needed surgery again.""When they woke me, I was screaming in pain,"" she wrote. ""The procedure had failed. I had a massive bleed and the doctors made it plain that my chances of surviving were precarious if they didn't operate again. This time they needed to access my brain in the old-fashioned way—through my skull.""Thankfully, Emilia shared, she's now ""at a hundred per cent.""

Cori Broadus's Stroke

Snoop Dogg's daughter Cori Broadus is grateful for her family.Because after she suffered a ""severe stroke"" in January 2024, her loved ones rushed to be by her side.""I texted them that I just had a stroke and sent them a picture,"" she told E!

""Everybody just came to my rescue.""Because of other medical concerns, Cori ended up staying in the hospital longer than she initially expected.""I could have went home after my stroke, but my lupus wasn't doing so well,"" the Snoop's Fatherhood: Cori and Wayne's Story star continued. ""My kidneys were failing. It was a lot going on.""Today, Cori is on the mend.""I'm doing great,"" she added. ""I just had a little bit of motor skills that I had to work back on. But other than that, I was fine.""

Shailene Woodley's Health Battle

Shailene Woodley's early 20s were not an easy time health-wise.“It got to the point where I was losing my hearing. I couldn't walk for longer than five minutes at a time without having to lay down for hours, and hours and sleep. Everything I ate hurt my stomach,” the actress said on a September 2024 episode of the SHE MD Podcast. “It was this conflation of issues and diagnoses and different doctors telling me different things.”So Shailene—who chose to keep the exact condition private—set out to find answers. “I come from a very holistic background and study herbalism,” she added. “So I was very keen on, ‘I'm going to work with real MDs, [and] I'm also going to work with independent kind of healers.' Just trying to search for some sense of comfort in my own skin.”It was a long journey—one that lasted for 10 years.“Throughout that decade, a lot of other things came from feeling so much discomfort physically,” the Big Little Lies star noted, “which was, ‘My gosh, if everything I eat hurts my stomach, I'm now suddenly afraid of food.' And then going into the kind of mental f--ckery that can happen with that of body dysmorphia and confusion about identity and feeling safe in my own capsule, in my own skin, what that meant, and what that should be.”After tending to both her physical and mental health, Shailene is feeling much better.“It was a journey that ultimately physically resolved itself, and I am very healthy,” she shared. “I'm so happy to be able to say that.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","‘I Will Be There'—Gio Reyna Makes Bold USMNT Claim After Disappointing Gladbach Debut","https://www.si.com/soccer/gio-reyna-bold-usmnt-claim-disappointing-gladbach-debut","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 11:00:03 GMT","

Even in a heavy defeat, Gio Reyna has the U.S. men's national team and the 2026 FIFA World Cup in his sights. 

The American midfielder made his debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach on Sunday following his transfer from Borussia Dortmund. Yet, it didn't go to plan, with a 4–0 defeat against Werder Bremen dropping Gladbach to 16th in the Bundesliga after three matches.

After arriving from Dortmund on a transfer worth up to a reported $7 million, Reyna did not appear in the club's first two matches of the season with a focus on building up his fitness, before eventually making his first start on Sunday.

The 22-year-old played 74 minutes in the defeat, primarily taking on the No. 10 role, where he helped create a chance with a through ball to Robin Hack, and mustered three shots of his own on a day where his side were heavily outplayed. 

While the loss won't turn many heads, his return to regular minutes in the German top flight grabbed attention, especially with him expressing his belief and hope that he will be on Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT roster come the summer. 

“I believe I will be there. That was one of the reasons for my move [to Gladbach],” he told BILD after the match. “I'm in open contact with the coach [Mauricio Pochettino]. If I play well here, I will definitely find my way back to the national team.

“I am now at a point where I want to take the next step and take my career to a higher level. I feel ready for it, that's why I came to Gladbach.”

Should he hope to play at the World Cup, he will not only need to improve his form and play significant minutes, but earn a call to an earlier USMNT camp, after Pochettino said the team will start to focus on its World Cup roster build following a September window that featured a loss to South Korea and win against Japan. 

Reyna's American teammate, Joe Scally, did not see the pitch on Sunday and appears to be well down the list of defensive options for Pochettino, especially with the USMNT potentially maintaining a three-man backline in the future. 

Gladbach return to Bundesliga action on Sept. 21 against Bayer Leverkusen, with Reyna and Scally eyeing October USMNT friendlies against Australia and Ecuador. 

“Of course, I want to be back in [the USMNT], but I know that's only possible with playing time and performing well,” Reyna said. “So that's how it is. That's how it should be also.”

Bayern Munich director of sport Max Eberl has been discussing Chelsea's Club World Cup triumph.

Bayern take on Chelsea in the Champions League this Wednesday, and Eberl has shared whether he thinks the Blues actually deserved to win the Club World Cup.

Enzo Maresca‘s men beat Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in the final to win the trophy and become world champions.

Chelsea could play in the next Club World Cup as FIFA weigh up whether to invite them back to the tournament following their success in the summer.

Chelsea were not the favourites to win the Club World Cup and their triumph in the competition surprised many.

Whatever the case, for Eberl, Chelsea were worthy winners of the trophy, and the Bayern director is now looking forward to watching his club go up against them later this week.

“I'm really excited about Wednesday's match,” the 51-year-old told Bild. “I think Chelsea deserved to win the final, with their incredible energy. They haven't gotten any worse since then. 

“On the contrary, they will of course have become even more stable. But this energy is precisely our game, too. That's why I believe a very, very exciting, high-quality match awaits us on Wednesday.”

Chelsea's Club World Cup success has been great for the club on and off the pitch. In the summer, it was claimed that the status of world champions had made Chelsea a more appealing destination for players.

Glory in the US has not raised expectations at Stamford Bridge, though. It is believed that top four is still the aim for Chelsea this season. 

Eberl has also spoken about Nicolas Jackson, who joined Bayern from Chelsea on the final day of the summer transfer window.

“He had other offers, even for a permanent transfer,” the former Bayern player said, as he discussed Jackson's loan move to the Allianz Arena.

The 24-year-old will be allowed to play against Chelsea on Wednesday, with UEFA's loan rules not being the same as the Premier League‘s.

Jackson made his Bayern debut over the weekend, helping the Bundesliga champions to beat Hamburg 5-0.

Harry Kane has discussed Jackson, too, describing his new teammate as a “great addition” to Vincent Kompany's squad. Maresca's men will have to keep both men quiet to have a chance of getting a positive result at the Allianz Arena.","{'href': 'https://www.thechelseachronicle.com', 'title': 'The Chelsea Chronicle'}","soccer"

FIFA has quietly revealed the new logo for the Intercontinental Cup. This fresh design marks a significant visual update, building upon the aesthetic of the all-new Club World Cup.

While an official reveal is expected in the near future, the new logo has already made its initial appearance. Eagle-eyed fans spotted the updated branding in promotional materials for the first-round match between Auckland FC and Pyramids FC, offering a sneak peek into the tournament's new visual identity.

Bayern Munich sporting director Max Eberl believes Chelsea will be even more improved from their FIFA Club World Cup success this summer.

Chelsea and Bayern collide in their Champions League opener on Wednesday evening in Munich. It's a rematch of the 2012 final and brings together two teams with big ambitions.

Chelsea made headlines in the summer after winning the FIFA Club World Cup in the USA. The West Londoners upset favourites Paris Saint-Germain to win the final 3-0 and Eberl was impressed by the performance of Enzo Maresca's side.

He is expecting a high-quality contest in midweek and believes Chelsea will have got even better since that summer triumph.

“I'm really excited for Wednesday's match. I think Chelsea deserved to win the [Club World Cup] final, with their incredible energy. They haven't gotten any worse since then,” Eberl told BILD.

“On the contrary, they will of course have become even more stable. But this energy is precisely our game, too. That's why I believe a very, very exciting, high-quality match awaits us on Wednesday.”

After a World Cup in Russia (2018) and a winter edition in Qatar (2022), and with an expanded, itinerant edition across three continents on the horizon (2030) and another journey to the Persian Gulf (Saudi Arabia 2034), it was by no means easy to legitimize the 2026 edition as a controversial World Cup. FIFA, after all, has forced us over the past decade to recalibrate every standard in this regard, and the upcoming tournament in the United States, Mexico, and Canada initially seemed the most normal of this particular historical moment. But then Donald Trump returned to the White House, the geopolitical scenario—both regional and global—changed drastically, and the next FIFA World Cup edition sank into an abyss of controversies, perplexities, and criticism.

Un post condiviso da Gianni Infantino - FIFA President (@gianni_infantino)

It couldn't be otherwise, after repeated visits of the global football leader Gianni Infantino to the Oval Office and the questionable statements made on those occasions, as well as after the American president suggested the possible presence of Vladimir Putin in the U.S. to attend the event. But even earlier, after the Trump administration's immigration and tariff policies, which closely concern the two co-host countries of the tournament, Mexico and Canada.

But that's not all. There are also the numerous issues highlighted by the Club World Cup last July, held in the United States and touted from day one as a pre-2026 general test; a month of football that revealed many uncertainties—not least the climate-related problems—and few certainties, except for Trump's omnipresence, which the international audience found only moderately welcome. Yet, according to promises from both the U.S. and FIFA presidents, it is “an event that can lift global spirits”, for which “we look forward to welcoming the fans”.

“Usually only the FIFA president, the winning team, and the president of the winning nation can touch it,” Gianni Infantino said on August 23, placing the World Cup trophy in the hands of the Republican leader. “But since you are a winner, you can touch it.” “Can I keep it?” – Trump replied, wearing a hat with the inscription Trump Was Right About Everything. “It would look good on that wall.” The scene took place during one of many visits by the football chief to Washington and was broadcast worldwide within minutes.

In August 2018, in the same walls, Infantino had presented Trump, then in the middle of his first term, with a personalized number 45 jersey (referencing his presidency) and a referee kit, “so he could send someone off.” A perfect setup for showing it off to the journalists present—no migrants nearby, after all—with the usual mix of joking, intimidation, and inappropriateness. In the background that day was the United 2026 (USA-Mexico-Canada) bid and, above all, the government guarantees package requested by FIFA for approval. Non-discriminatory access for athletes, officials, and fans, commitments on security, public order, and human rights, streamlined visa and work permit procedures, and so on. Political guarantees were formally documented by Washington between 2017 and the FIFA Congress vote in June 2018.

With the arrival of the 2025 Club World Cup and the approach of the national version, Infantino and Trump's interactions intensified. Along with it, the Swiss official's increasingly evident determination to assert himself as a partner and friend of the White House tenant, as well as a political actor—without any democratic legitimacy—on the international stage. In recent months, FIFA announced the opening of an office in Trump Tower, New York, visited Washington eight times (five of them in the Oval Office), shared information with a task force created by U.S. federal agencies, involved Ivanka Trump in the 2025 Club World Cup draw, and officially moved the 2026 group stage from the Las Vegas Sphere to the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.

On a personal level, Infantino shared some of the U.S. president's messages on his own channels, attended the ceremony for Trump's return to the White House, thanked him “for all he does for the development of football in the United States”, and publicly invited him to the next World Cup final, with “row 1, seat 1 reserved.” As if an invitation were needed to put Trump at the center of attention. “It will be impossible not to notice him next summer,” wrote Alexander Abnos in The Guardian, “Trump will make sure he is at the center of attention, even in places where he has no interest or where his involvement might be seen as inappropriate: a dynamic Americans know well, more than a decade after Trump's rise.”

Speaking of unnecessary invitations, during Infantino's latest visit two weeks ago, Trump once again pulled out a classic media ace. Showing cameras a photo of himself with Vladimir Putin and mentioning the Russian president's willingness to attend next summer's World Cup matches. Yet another unsettling vignette reminding us how much the football showcase will be shaped by his personalistic and political direction.

Even the image recently shared by Putin, showing the two presidents side by side at the recent Alaska summit, quickly went viral online and on social media. But how serious and realistic is it? Legally, since February 2022 (the invasion of Ukraine), Putin has been listed on OFAC's SDN list, which blocks assets and transactions with U.S. persons—not an automatic entry ban, but an obstacle for visa approval and public opinion. Outside U.S. borders, since March 2023, Putin is under an ICC arrest warrant for war crimes and illegal deportation of minors; while the U.S. is not bound by this, Canada and Mexico are.

The football context also doesn't support the hypothesis. FIFA and UEFA have suspended, until further notice, all Russian clubs and national teams from their tournaments, including 2026 qualifiers. How could the global audience legitimize Putin's presence while simultaneously excluding athletes who certainly do not bear the same responsibility as him—if any—for what is happening in Ukraine? It should be noted that Israel's lack of a ban in the same competitions already provides clear evidence of double standards, but Putin in the stands in New York and Miami would be very hard for American and European audiences to accept.

Beyond the feasibility of an invitation, there is the political point: Trump's allusion to Putin's possible presence, just days after the Anchorage bilateral summit, confirms the use of the upcoming football mega-event as a diplomatic instrument. A move that shifts the public discourse from how the tournament is organized to who can cross its borders, forcing FIFA to navigate the slippery terrain between long-abandoned sporting neutrality and international geopolitics.

In 2018, as mentioned, guarantees and standards for entry and anti-discrimination policies were put on the table to win the bid. Today, however, the call to respect those same promises comes not from FIFA—which seems to have forgotten everything in favor of the Infantino-Trump relationship—but from NGOs and human rights observers, such as Amnesty, Human Rights Watch, and the Sport & Rights Alliance, who, a year before the event, are demanding a public and mandatory Human Rights Framework for 2026, conflicting with increasingly restrictive U.S. immigration and public order policies. There is a justified concern about selective checks, denied visas, and obstacles for media, activists, and LGBTQ+ visitors.

In parallel, relations with the co-hosts have become tense in recent months. Trump raised tariffs on neighbors with trade war rhetoric, revived the narrative of Canada as the 51st state, and suggested military operations and political interventions in Mexican territory to combat drug cartels.

Then there are the issues inherited from Qatar 2022, resurfacing in practical terms. The 2025 trial run showed heatwaves and unexpected stoppages due to extreme weather, and academic studies (Queen's University Belfast) indicate that ten out of sixteen venues are at very high risk of heat stress in the summer of 2026. Players' stance, expressed in a FIFPRO open letter, is clear: implement cooling breaks when temperatures exceed 28°C, and postpone any match beyond the 32°C limit.

There is also the labor issue, inherited from Doha and relevant for future World Cup editions. In March, the union BWI accused FIFA of denying access to Estadio Azteca (Mexico City) for an independent inspection, and months of pressure were needed for a site visit on July 9. A first step toward transparency, but also a worrying signal considering the four months between the initial access attempt and actual opening of the site.

Starting in 2024, Saudi Aramco became a FIFA Major Worldwide Partner until 2027, including the 2026 edition and the path toward 2034 in Saudi Arabia. This choice underlines how FIFA's declared neutrality is increasingly, in reality, a policy of deliberate alliances and handshakes with actors who routinely violate the foundational values of sport: inclusion, hospitality, anti-discrimination, and respect for human, civil, and labor rights. But all things considered, are you ready to have your spirits lifted by Infantino and Trump?

The Norwegian Football Federation (NFF) has said profits from Norway's World Cup qualifier against Israel in October will go to Doctors Without Borders, an organisation providing humanitarian relief in Gaza.

The NFF announced on Monday its collaboration with the independent organisation, which has provided emergency medical care in over 70 countries affected by wars, natural disasters and epidemics. Israel's military invaded Gaza after Hamas's attacks in October 2023, and more than 60,000 people have died in the region, according to the local health ministry.

The NFF said the raised money would be “earmarked for the organisation's emergency relief work on the ground in Gaza”.

Norway host Israel in Oslo on October 11.

“We have an opportunity to qualify for an international men's championship for the first time in 26 years,” NFF president Lise Klaveness said in a statement. “At the same time, the match is being played at a time marked by serious humanitarian suffering and deep conflicts in the Middle East.

“As a member of FIFA and UEFA, the NFF must deal with Israel's participation in their competitions. At the same time, we cannot and will not be indifferent to the humanitarian suffering that is happening in the region, especially the disproportionate attacks against civilians in Gaza.

“We want to give the profits to an organisation that saves lives in the Gaza Strip every day and that contributes with active emergency aid on the ground, and that is what Doctors Without Borders does.”

The NFF added that since their announcement, one of Norway's largest investment companies — who wish to remain anonymous — has also pledged three million Krone ($305,000, £224,200) towards Doctors Without Borders.

Lindis Hurum, secretary of Doctors Without Borders, said the organisation is “completely dependent on private funds” and that the money “will save lives”.

Hurum added: “We work in Gaza and the surrounding areas where the situation is absolutely desperate for the civilian population, but people all over the world depend on our emergency response.”

Klaveness has previously called on FIFA to investigate Israel's participation in its competitions, saying “football must not be used in a way that undermines internationally recognised rights or established legal principles”.

The NFF also provided a donation towards a football project for children in Gaza, and has undergone a long-term initiative working with Palestinian schools and refugee camps, as well as opening coaching pathways for women and girls.

Klaveness was also opposed to the World Cup being held in Russia and Qatar in 2018 and 2022, saying “human rights, equality and democracy” had not been considered in allowing the countries to host the competition.

Carlo Ancelotti's new stint as the manager of the Brazilian national team saw the Selecao secure a 3-0 win over Chile before losing 1-0 to Bolivia.

A key feature of his management so far was the team selection, with the former Real Madrid manager resorting to a high degree of rotation between the two matches.

Nevertheless, as Brazil prepare for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the big question is how exactly will Ancelotti employ the services of three Real Madrid attackers in Endrick, Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo.

Ancelotti managed all three players at Real Madrid last season, but all of them ended up enduring a difficult campaign and were outshone by Kylian Mbappe.

In a recent interview with L'Equipe, Ancelotti was asked about Vinicius' role in the team and whether or not he will be a part of Brazil's World Cup squad next year.

“If he is in good health, yes. He must be at his best,” the Italian coach said about Vinicius' place in the team.

This should come as a huge boost for a player who has struggled with form and must reinvent himself sooner rather than later.

Ancelotti was also asked about Rodrygo's place in the World Cup, to which the Italian sounded a lot less confident despite confirming that he will be a part of the team if he is in good form.

“If he is at his best, he will be an excellent player. You can't talk to me about this duo, I won the Champions League with them,” he said about Rodrygo.

Finally, the former Real Madrid coach was asked about Endrick, who struggled to make a mark during his first season at the club.

Ancelotti admitted Endrick's struggles but added that the competition at Real Madrid might have played a key role.

“Endrick is similar to Estevao. He is a great talent. I coached Endrick for a year, and I was very impressed with him as a person and as a professional player. 

“It's clear that he didn't perform well last year because Real Madrid has Rodrygo and Vinicius. Competition in a big team is extremely important, and this can slightly affect a player's development,” he concluded.

It must be noted that Real Madrid have enjoyed a positive start to the new season under new coach Xabi Alonso.

While Rodrygo and Endrick have struggled due to game-time and injury, Vinicius' form has been encouraging, with the Brazilian being involved in three goals in La Liga so far.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Leading soccer officials view the 2026 FIFA World Cup -- with matches hosted in three cities across Mexico -- as a “runway that could lead to groundbreaking cross-border growth for Liga MX,” according to Felipe Cardenas of THE ATHLETIC. Foreign investment has “already become a factor and is poised to increase in stature,” while commercial opportunities could “turn Mexico's first division into one of the world's most profitable leagues and leave MLS, a valued partner, behind.” MLS wants to “appeal to the millions of Mexican-American fans in the U.S. and expose its clubs to more competitive matches against Liga MX teams.” Club officials in Mexico, along with the Mexican Football Federation, “view tournaments against MLS teams as commercially viable brand-building exercises.” Liga MX President Mikel Arriola last month said that a decision to play official Liga MX fixtures in the U.S. “would be made together with MLS.” Innovatio Capital founder Marc Spiegel -- whose company recently acquired Querétaro FC to become the first majority-U.S. ownership group in Liga MX -- “sees a future where Liga MX and MLS move past their current state, which he called ‘dating' to a relationship that could change the sport forever.” Spiegel: “Do the two leagues merge one day? I think that could be a game-changer globally in the football space.” Cardenas wrote “With foreign capital now actively flowing through the league and a new media rights deal on the horizon, Liga MX is primed for its own foundational transformation” (THE ATHLETIC, 9/12).","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","soccer"

This historic change is set to redefine the way in which the world's biggest sporting event plays out. With more nations, more matches, and more storylines, though, the competition promises to be bigger and more inclusive than ever before. Still, at the same time, it also raises questions about quality, logistics and tradition.

Fans all over the world are already looking forward to the feel of a tournament on an unprecedented scale, with announcements of the World Cup 2026 tickets and early details of match schedules.

The road to the event is paved with excitement, yet it is also filled with uncertainty about how the expanded format will impact the game itself.

In the past, the World Cup has been comfortably structured with 32 teams, with eight groups of four and a simple path to the knockout rounds.

The jump to 48 teams alters this balance completely. The tournament will now have 12 groups of 4 teams, after which the top 2 of each group and the best 8 of the remaining eight will go forward, including the third.

This new structure adds more games to the schedule, increasing the tournament's length and the number of matches from 64 to over 100.

The reason for the change is, in part, that football's governing organisation, the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), wants to include more nations in the competition.

For many countries that have struggled to qualify in their regions because of the massive competition, the door is now open.

This inclusivity will ensure that fans from more corners of the globe will see their national flags represented on the grandest stage of football.

The prospect of greater representation fits in with the World Cup's identity as a genuinely global festival. However, inevitably, there are worries about whether the quality of play will still be at the same elite level.

For smaller footballing nations, the expansion is a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Countries that have historically underperformed in terms of qualification have a good chance to participate.

The experience of playing against the best in the world can catalyze development in football back home, inspiring new generations of players and driving investment in infrastructure.

The World Cup has always meant more than crowning a champion, but has been about celebrating cultures, traditions, and the unifying power of the game.

An expanded format means that the cultural mosaic of the tournament will be even richer. Supporters from all over Africa, Asia and smaller parts of Europe and the Americas will bring new colours and energy to stadiums across North America.

While the goal of inclusivity is a laudable one, critics argue that the larger format runs the risk of watering down the quality of competition.

With the increasing number of teams involved, there will likely be more cases of mismatched fixtures in which footballing heavyweights will be pitted against inexperienced teams that have little hope of winning.

This could lead to one-sided scorelines, which would take the fun out of the group stages.

However, tournaments are characterised as much by upsets as they are expected victories. Some of the best World Cup memories have come from when underdogs defied odds and expectations, like Cameroon in 1990 or Costa Rica in 2014.

With more emerging nations in the mix, the chances of new Cinderella stories are high, and fans are given the opportunity to witness history being made.

An expanded tournament also means an increased amount of strain on players and coaching staff. With over 100 games to be played in multiple cities in three vast countries, travel and scheduling will become a larger factor than ever before.

Teams may be required to travel great distances from fixture to fixture with little or no rest time between. For players who already have gruelling schedules with their clubs, the demands of a longer World Cup could take its toll on physical limits.

Squad depth will prove more important, as managers will have to rotate effectively to ensure that their players are kept fresh.

Teams with deep rosters of talent may be better positioned to deal with the grind, while lesser teams could falter under the pressure. Fitness, preparation, and adaptability will probably be as crucial as tactics and skill in determining success.

For fans, the expansion is all opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, an increase in games means more opportunities to attend games and support their countries.

The spread of games throughout the United States, Mexico and Canada also means that fans from different regions have an easier time accessing matches without having to travel across continents.

On the other hand, such a large tournament may make it more difficult for travelling fans to follow their teams consistently, as fixtures may be scheduled thousands of miles apart.

Ticket demand is already high with anticipation growing as details of matchdays continue to emerge. Supporters are making sure they get their places in stadiums because this World Cup will be like no other in terms of scale and energy.

Balancing accessibility and affordability will be crucial if the tournament is to maintain its reputation as a global festival for fans, rather than simply a commercial venture.

The 2026 World Cup is not just another version of football's most significant event - it is a turning point in the game's history.

The move from 32 to 48 teams is a more expansive vision of inclusivity, expansion and global participation. It provides hope to emerging nations, it provides excitement to fans wanting new stories and it allows players to make their mark on the biggest stage.

Yet with these opportunities come challenges that cannot be ignored. Maintaining the competitive balance, looking after player welfare and ensuring a fan-centric experience will be key to the success of the tournament.

FIFA and the organising committees are faced with a tricky balancing act between ambition and practicality, inclusiveness and excellence.","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","soccer"

Winners and losers as derby defeat leaves Man Utd boss hanging by a thread but has Erling Haaland looking back to his best for Man City","https://www.goal.com/en-qa/lists/can-ruben-amorim-survive-winners-losers-derby-defeat-man-utd-boss-hanging-thread-erling-haaland-man-city/blt0ff9baa2acbeea78","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 06:32:04 GMT","

Just after Phil Foden had set Manchester City on their way to their damning 3-0 win over Manchester United on Sunday, fans could be heard chanting Ruben Amorim's name. At first it seemed that United's 3,000 visiting supporters were defiantly backing their coach, and yet it soon became clear that it was in fact City's fans who were doing the singing.

They were using the very same song United fans composed earlier this year, which claims that Amorim will ""bring the glory days again"" and ""turn the Reds around"" to laugh and mock the Portuguese. It was a stroke of genius from the City supporters, who used to be on the receiving end of such derision from their Red neighbours, and it is hard to disagree with them. The idea that Amorim is going to turn United around, on this evidence, is indeed laughable. 

His side had their moments in the early stages of the derby, but in the second half the contest felt as one-sided as a bullfight. And with blood pouring from the tortured animal, the question is: When should they be put out of their misery?

Amorim made it clear yet again that he is not going to walk away and nor is he going to change his methods or alter his formation. He is going to die by his ideas. So Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his fellow directors have a choice: Either grin and bear the misery, which is becoming more and more frequent, or end the experiment now.

""When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man,"" Amorim said. ""I don't believe in that or in the system or whatever, but I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change.""

Amorim might be the only one believing in his way right now after United confirmed their worst start to a league season since 1992-93. That campaign had a very happy ending as United went on to win the first ever Premier League title, but do Ratcliffe and co. really believe that Amorim is about to do a Sir Alex Ferguson and suddenly lead United to the promised land? If so, then they are right to keep him in charge. But a lot has changed since that first Premier League season, and Amorim, as he keeps reminding us, does not want to change.

1) Musetti Top Seed: Musetti returns to Chengdu for the third consecutive year. The Italian reached the semi-finals in 2023, before falling to Shang Juncheng in the championship match a year ago. Musetti has double motivation this time around in Chengdu: As well as chasing his third ATP Tour crown, he could also boost his Nitto ATP Finals qualification hopes with a deep run in Sichuan province. The 23-year-old is currently eighth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. 

 2) Shang Defends Title: #NextGenATP star Shang made history in Chengdu a year ago, when he became the first Chinese player to win an ATP Tour title on home soil. The 20-year-old has struggled with injuries and competed in just five tournaments so far in 2025, but he will hope to channel home support to relaunch his season. Shang faces Zizou Bergs in the opening round. 

Watch Shang defeat Musetti in 2024 Chengdu Final: 

 3) Can Darderi, Wong Back Up US Open Runs?: Luciano Darderi competes as the second seed in Chengdu, where the World No. 30 hopes to back up a third-round US Open run that only eventual champion Alcaraz was able to end. Coleman Wong also reached the third round in New York, and the Hong Kong star competes as a wild card on his Chengdu debut. 

 4) Prizmic On Course For Jeddah: Dino Prizmic is currently fourth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, and he can further boost his qualification hopes for the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF in Chengdu. The 20-year-old Croatian enters the main draw using a Next Gen Accelerator entry spot granted to #NextGenATP stars ranked in the Top 250 of the PIF ATP Rankings. 

 5) Harrison/King Lead Doubles Field: Christian Harrison and Evan King are the top seeds in Chengdu, where they seek to consolidate their chances of securing a Nitto ATP Finals debut: The Americans are currently eighth in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings. Their rivals in the draw in China include two-time defending champions Sadio Doumbia and Fabien Reboul, who are 10th. 



 FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN HANGZHOU 
1) Rublev To Rejuvenate Turin Hopes?: The 27-year-old Rublev needs to engineer a late-season surge if he is to make his sixth consecutive appearance at the Nitto ATP Finals. He is currently 11th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, 660 points shy of the qualification spots. Rublev is the top seed in Hangzhou, where he will first face Aleksandar Kovacevic or Luca Nardi. 

2) Medvedev Seeks Turnaround: The former World No. 1 Medvedev has gone 3-5 since reaching the Halle final in June, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. He will seek a quick response in Hangzhou, where he is bidding to win his 21st tour-level title. Medvedev could face another former Top 10 star and the defending Hangzhou champion, Marin Cilic, in his opening match.

3) Home Star Zhang Returns: Zhang Zhizhen competes for the first time since Indian Wells in March as a wild card in Hangzhou. He takes on his countryman Buyunchaokete in the first rond. Meanwhile Hangzhou native Wu Yibing, who is back inside the Top 200 after playing just six tournaments in 2024 before returning to action in March this year, opens against sixth seed Adrian Mannarino. 

4) Bublik, Tien Among Seeds: Alexander Bublik, who has won 11 of his past 12 matches, will have plenty of recent success to build on as the third seed in Hangzhou. Also competing is #NextGenATP star Learner Tien, the 19-year-old seventh seed making his first ATP Tour appearance in China. 

5) Cabral/Miedler Headline Doubles Draw: Francisco Cabral and Lucas Miedler are the top-seeded doubles team in Hangzhou, where they are chasing their second ATP 250 crown of the year. Americans Robert Cash and JJ Tracy, the recent US Open semi-finalists, are the second seeds. 

 FIVE THINGS TO WATCH AT LAVER CUP 
1) Alcaraz Back In Action As No. 1: For the first time since September 2023, Alcaraz will compete as the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings when he takes to court at the Laver Cup in San Francisco. The Spaniard made an immediate impact on event debut in 2024 in Berlin, where he won eight points from four matches in Team Europe's 13-11 triumph. 

 2) Top 10 Talent Powers Team World: World No. 5 Taylor Fritz and No. 8 Alex de Minaur will spearhead Team World's bid to recapture the Laver Cup trophy in front of its home fans. Fritz is competing at the event for the fifth time, including triumphs in London in 2022 and Vancouver in 2023. Australia's De Minaur returns for his second appearance after also featuring in Team World's London win.

 3) New Captains Agassi, Noah: The eighth edition of the Laver Cup brings with it new captains for both teams. Andre Agassi has replaced his fellow ATP No. 1 Club member John McEnroe as Team World captain, with another former World No. 1 Patrick Rafter as vice-captain. Frenchman Yannick Noah takes over from Bjorn Borg as Team Europe captain, with Tim Henman his vice-captain. 

 4) #NextGenATP Stars Make Debut: Two of the ATP Tour's hottest talents will make their Laver Cup debut in California. Czechia's Jakub Mensik, who lifted his maiden ATP Masters 1000 title in Miami in March, plays for Team Europe. Brazilian Joao Fonseca, the reigning Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion, represents Team World. 

 5) Unique Format: As in all previous editions, the Laver Cup will be played over three days, from 19-21 September, across five sessions. Each match win is worth one point on Friday, two points on Saturday and three points on a high-stakes Sunday. The first team to reach 13 points (out of a possible 24) wins the Laver Cup.

Frenchman Hugo Gaston spoiled Stan Wawrinka's hopes of becoming the oldest ATP Challenger Tour champion on Sunday at the Open Blot Rennes.


A full crowd in northwest France was treated to a final between the top two seeds, the home hope Gaston and fans' favourite Wawrinka, respectively. The lefty prevailed, ousting Wawrinka 6-4, 6-4. Wawrinka, 40, was aiming to surpass Ivo Karlovic's record of oldest Challenger champion (39 years, seven months).


“I thank my team, we are happy to start our collaboration with Tristan [Lamasine] with a title,” Gaston said during the trophy ceremony. “It's always a joy to play here. The arena is incredible. A big thank you to the fans, playing in a full stadium is great.""

Gaston, who entered the week on a five-match skid across all levels, dropped just one set all tournament to lift his fifth Challenger crown. He is up 22 spots to No. 106 in the PIF ATP Rankings, eyeing a return to the Top 100.


Wawrinka was competing in his second Challenger final of the season. He reached the championship match in Aix-en-Provence in May, falling to Borna Coric in a three-hour, 11-minute battle. The former No. 3 holds a 16-8 season record at the Challenger level and will be in action again this week in Saint-Tropez.


“I congratulate Hugo and his team,” Wawrinka said. “He had a great week, he was stronger, it's deserved. Despite the defeat, it was a very positive week, a success. I'm trying to make the most of my career, unfortunately I'm getting older. It's not good to be 40, but it's always a thrill to be on the court, thanks to the crowd, the emotions and the support they give me. It's one of the reasons why I keep fighting.”







In other Challenger action, Briton Jack Pinnington Jones captured his second trophy of the season to rise to a career-high No. 177. The former Texas Christian University standout triumphed at the Winston Salem Challenger in North Carolina.

Pinnington Jones, 22, did not drop a set all week and saved 17 of the 19 break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats. In the final, he defeated 19-year-old American Trevor Svajda 6-2, 6-2. Pinnington Jones completed his junior season at Texas Christian University in May and won his first Challenger title in July at the grass-court event in Nottingham.

Argentines Thiago Agustin Tirante, Juan Manuel Cerundolo and Marco Trungelliti also lifted trophies. The 24-year-old Tirante won the Invest in Szczecin Open, where he beat Spaniard Pablo Llamas Ruiz 6-3, 6-2 in the final. 

“I think it was a very, very good match for me,” said Tirante, who is back in the Top 100 for the first time since last September. “I played well from the first point until the last one, so I'm very happy to come back and win a title, I think the biggest of my career. I think it's my first title in Europe. I'm very happy to win and return to the Top 100.”

Cerundolo earned his 11th Challenger title and first on hard court at the
Guangzhou Huangpu International Tennis Open in China. The 23-year-old downed fellow lefty Alejandro Tabilo 6-2, 6-3 in the championship match. Following his triumph, Cerundolo is at a career-high No. 72 in the PIF ATP Rankings.

“I'm really happy because it's my first title on hard courts. I never expected this,” Cerundolo said. “This is my first time in China. There's an 11-hour time difference between here and my home, so the first days were pretty tough. I couldn't sleep, so I had to adapt very quickly. 

“I'm really happy about it and I hope to keep improving and keep getting better, especially on this surface.”

Trungelliti won the Intaro Open in Romania to cap back-to-back title runs. The winner of the previous week's Tulln Challenger, Trungelliti led Mili Poljicak 6-1 in the final when the Croatian retired due to an oblique injury. The 35-year-old has won six Challenger titles, three of which have come this season.

Italian Stefano Napolitano was crowned champion at his home tournament, the città di Biella. Entering the week at No. 847 in the PIF ATP Rankings, the 30-year-old relied on home support to become the lowest-ranked Challenger champion this season. A four-time Challenger champion, Napolitano ousted Swiss Kilian Feldbausch 7-5, 6-3 in the final.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","How Jakub Mensik leveraged ATP Tennis IQ powered by PIF to triumph in Miami","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/mensik-tennis-iq-september-2025","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:56:55 GMT","

Jakub Mensik's booming first serve has been the cornerstone of his rapid rise, and during his breakthrough run in Miami, ATP Tennis IQ powered by PIF helped elevate it to a new level.

The #NextGenATP Czech slammed 59 aces in his opening three matches at the ATP Masters 1000 event, yet he still looked for ways to gain an extra edge as he chased his first ATP Tour title.

Watch Jakub Mensik explain how he uses ATP Tennis IQ powered by PIF

Using ATP Tennis IQ powered by PIF, Mensik discovered just how effective he was when targeting first serves out wide — a strategy that proved decisive in the latter stages and ultimately the final, where he stunned six-time Miami champion Novak Djokovic to lift the title.

“This year in Miami, ATP Tennis IQ was very important, because throughout the tournament I had been changing a lot of tactics,” Mensik explained. “I could see in the first couple of matches that I was good in some kinds of patterns, for example serves out wide.

“In Miami, the surface is super fast, and I had been winning a lot of percentages. In the final rounds, I was using it more often, which could bring me the win.”



ATP Tennis IQ is an enhanced performance-analytics platform that delivers richer match data, advanced scouting, video breakdowns, and wearable integration, all in real-time. The tool is now available to more than 2,000 ATP Tour and ATP Challenger Tour players, as well as ATP coaches, bringing elite-level analysis within reach across the professional game.

By providing insights into opponents' tendencies, tactical patterns, and real-time physical metrics, it empowers players to refine preparation, adapt strategy mid-match, and elevate overall development. Read more about the platform here.

For Mensik, another key tool has been the ability to compare his own numbers with Tour averages, a feature that he believes has been vital in his rise to a career-high No. 16 in the PIF ATP Rankings.

“ATP Tennis IQ powered by PIF is a must for every pro,” said Mensik. “It can help me break into the higher rankings by seeing my reports. Also with the Tour average, the data from all of the players, take that and try to implement these numbers into your game.”

After an action-packed day in Guadalajara, three first-time WTA semifinalists emerged: Iva Jovic, Elsa Jacquemot and Nikola Bartunkova, who capped the night with a straight sets win over defending champion Magdalena Frech.

Ahead of quarterfinal day in Guadalajara, several rising stars were eyeing a breakthrough into their first WTA semifinal.

Among them was 19-year-old Nikola Bartunkova, who faced a stiff test against defending champion Magdalena Frech.

But if the Czech -- who entered the tournament outside the top 200 -- was fazed, she didn't show it. Instead, Bartunkova dispatched Frech in straight sets with poise and precision.

Guadalajara: Scores | Draw | Order of play

Playing later than anticipated and on the Grandstand court instead of the main stadium court due to weather delays, Bartunkova rolled with the punches. She overcame an early break in the opening set and never looked back, sealing a 7-5, 6-4 victory in 1 hour and 38 minutes.

With the win, Bartunkova advances to her first WTA semifinal -- coming in her first WTA-level tournament in nearly two years. 

It also marks the first top 30 victory of her career.

For 17-year-old American Iva Jovic, mission accomplished.

Jovic defeated Victoria Jimenez Kasintseva in a grueling 2-hour, 38-minute match that featured a nearly hourlong rain delay, an outfit change -- from a black kit to a purple one -- and dramatic momentum swings. She broke serve twice to stay alive in the third set, then saved a match point in a tense third-set tiebreak to clinch a spot in the next round.

Easy enough.

“I'm still shaking,” Jovic said after the match. “I can't believe I got through that match -- it was so up and down. But I never expected to get so much support here in Guadalajara. You guys got me through the match.”

With the win, Jovic improves to 11-3 in three-set matches across all levels this season.

To thank the fans for their support and for providing her with the final push she needed to secure the victory, Jovic gave it her best shot in Spanish.

“Muchísimas gracias por venir a apoyarme,” Jovic said. “Me pusieron los pelos de punta. Me ayudaron a superar el partido.”

Earlier in the day, fans at Akron Stadium were treated to another thrilling battle, as Elsa Jacquemot outlasted veteran Tatjana Maria to reach her first WTA-level semifinal.

Maria, the more experienced player, looked in control early, taking the first set 6-3. But the 22-year-old Frenchwoman from Lyon rallied from a set down to win 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 in 2 hours and 12 minutes.

Jacquemot was broken five times but broke Maria six times to edge ahead. Despite winning three fewer total points over the course of the match, Jacquemot found a way to prevail.

Elsewhere, Emiliana Arango continued her stellar run in Guadalajara, defeating Marina Stakusic 6-2, 6-3 in just 72 minutes to reach the semifinals without dropping a set.

It's Arango's second WTA 500 semifinal of the season -- both coming in Mexico, nearly seven months apart.

Why does Arango play such good tennis in Mexico? Even she's not sure.

“I have no idea,” Arango said after the match. “But I need more tournaments here in Mexico. I want all the tournaments to be here in Mexico so I can have all the people with me.”

Back in March, she reached the final in Mérida before falling in lopsided fashion -- losing 6-0, 6-0 to Emma Navarro. Now, as the only player left in the draw with experience this deep into a WTA-level tournament, she'll be looking for a better result this time around.

David Coulthard on McLaren team orders

Fred Vasseur has shared more thoughts on Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari adaptation two thirds of the way into his first season in red.

Ferrari team boss Fred Vasseur remains “convinced” that Lewis Hamilton will get back to his best at Ferrari sooner rather than later, admitting the squad might have “underestimated” the changes the Briton has experienced so far this year.

After two lengthy stints at McLaren and Mercedes, Hamilton made a blockbuster move to the Scuderia for the 2025 season – aiming to help end their championship-winning drought and get back to the top step of the podium himself.

It has been a mixed campaign for the seven-time World Champion so far, with highs including his Sprint pole position and victory at the Chinese Grand Prix, and lows including early Qualifying exits and point-less races.

Vasseur, though, is not concerned, underlining the various factors Hamilton has been getting used to in an appearance on F1's Beyond The Grid podcast.

“I don't know if we underestimated the importance of the change,” said Vasseur. “Probably, because he spent 10 years at McLaren, then 12 with Mercedes, but it was a kind of continuity – two teams based in the UK with the same engine, same environment.

“[Joining Ferrari] is a complete change for him, in his life, the culture of the team and everything. To do it in three test days in the winter period is quite difficult – and I think also the expectation was huge.

“We have to put everything in place, and it's taking time. We have to also manage expectations and manage the noise around the team.”

Making reference to F1's incredibly tight field in 2025, Vasseur continued: “The comments [about performances] are positive or negative for plus or minus one-tenth of a second, or plus or minus a click of front wing that you did or not – it's always marginal.

“If we are not able to put everything together from the preparation of the weekend, the adaptation to the simulator, blah, blah, blah, until Sunday, you can miss one-tenth there or one-tenth there. This is making a huge difference in terms of pure results.”

Moving forward, Vasseur stressed the importance of support – in both directions – as driver and team look to end the current season in a competitive way and approach F1's upcoming rules reset in a good place.

“It's up to us to support him when he is struggling, and we also need to push him when he's struggling,” said Vasseur. “Spa and Budapest were difficult for him, but he can be sure that he has the full support of everyone in Maranello to recover, to be back.

“I'm really convinced that he will do it. We have to be supportive with him every single day, and I will be supportive every single day with Lewis.

“It's a matter of support and mentality. He's fully committed, he's pushing like hell. He's trying to get the best from everybody, and he will always have my support for this.

“He's a champion, he's doing very well, and he has the pace. The other characteristic is to try to get the best from the people around you, extra motivation, and extra push. For sure, this characteristic is there.”

The Street Showdown is the next stage of the season and it is tense. Around the streets of Baku and Singapore, the walls are super close and with little run off, mistakes can end races.

David Coulthard on McLaren team orders

Red Bull and Ford are gearing up for F1's all-new regulations in 2026 – with Max Verstappen playing his part.

Red Bull team boss Laurent Mekies and Ford CEO Jim Farley have underlined the importance of four-time World Champion Max Verstappen when it comes to the success of their new power unit partnership.

Ahead of overhauled regulations coming into play next season, Red Bull Powertrains have been working in collaboration with Ford to develop engines that will be used by both Red Bull Racing and sister outfit Racing Bulls.

With current supplier Honda heading to Aston Martin, Mekies described the decision to make an engine from scratch as “the sort of crazy stuff Red Bull does” and likened the challenge to climbing Mount Everest.

As work continues at pace, Farley and Mekies – who appeared together at the recent Italian Grand Prix – both pointed to Verstappen as being a key part of the process on and off the track.

“I think this is one of the most important pillars or foundation for the PU's (power unit) success,” Farley told Sky Sports News.

“Talking to Max… we at Ford really have grown our respect for Max watching him this year. The way he has provided stability – without drama – in an environment where we're all just trying to do our jobs. I can really see that in his eyes today versus last year.

“I think it's one of the great things about Laurent and his team, that they all have this deep commitment to each other.”

Opening up on just how involved Verstappen is, Mekies added: “Max is doing a lot more than just asking for the numbers. You would be surprised. Max is giving so much to the projects also outside of the car.

“He's not just asking the numbers, he's testing the car in the simulators, he's working with engineers on both sides of the fence to understand how do we develop these 2026 cars? Where do we try to get the power? Where do we try to get the downforce?

“So, that's how central to the project he is. He certainly wants a fast car next year, and he's doing everything he can in the car and outside the car to help us give him that.”

David Coulthard on McLaren team orders

Trailer: F1 Memory Box with David Coulthard

Starring Brad Pitt and Damson Idris, F1 The Movie is driving a shift in fan fashion at Grand Prix weekends, moving from replica kits to the motorcore trend led by Tommy Hilfiger's APXGP collection.

Released in June 2025, F1 The Movie stars Brad Pitt and Damson Idris as APXGP drivers and brings Hollywood glamour to the Formula 1 paddock. Filmed at actual Grand Prix events with appearances by F1's biggest stars, it effectively merges reality with fiction – and its influence on fan fashion has been undeniable.

Before the movie, fan style at Grand Prix events primarily centred on team merchandise, such as replica jerseys and hats. Since the film's debut, a collaboration between Hollywood and Formula 1 has shaped global fan culture – especially in how trackside fashion now highlights the intersection of film, sport, and style. The shift is clear: fans wear more diverse and expressive wardrobes than ever before.

This influence has fuelled the “fashiontainment” experience, as F1 The Movie infuses motorsport fashion culture with iconic collaborations, Hollywood moments, and the rise of motorcore – all shaping what fans wear on and off the track.

The high fashion brand entered Formula 1 by dressing Lotus and Ferrari in the 1990s before, in 2018, partnering with Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes to create special capsule collections with the seven-time World Champion. Tommy Hilfiger's presence in F1 The Movie felt inevitable.

The American brand took a “go big or go home” approach and not only designed the actual team kit that the fictional APXGP used in the film, but also went a step further, launching it as a limited-edition item for Formula 1 fans. Released on 3 June, the capsule pieces are available on both the brand's website and the F1 Store, offering a perfect blend of Hilfiger's American style with bold motorsport elements – setting the stage for one of the latest and most influential fashion trends: motorcore dressing.

Fans now wear APXGP merchandise both at and away from the track, treating APXGP as the current “11th team”, showcasing the film's influence on fashion.

Damson Idris and his character Joshua Pierce, the face of the Tommy Hilfiger campaign, bring cinematic flair to the collection. Quilted jackets, mechanic shirts, and polos now serve as the perfect stylish alternative to team kits and merchandise.

One of the film's strongest fashion signals comes from the simplest costume. Brad Pitt, a self-declared fashion enthusiast, wanted his character's style to matter. He crafted subtle ambiguity – was he Sonny Hayes or Brad Pitt in the paddock during filming?

As declared by GQ, we later realised that it was all part of the character's wardrobe, with the pieces chosen by Julian Day, the costume designer, along with Pitt himself. With clothes that looked both authentic and comfortable, one garment in particular caught the attention of fans: a Sunspel sweatshirt. The demand was so high that the brand decided to create a relaunch of the exact one worn by Pitt in the film, featuring a thyme green and pale pink colour scheme, with fans not only wanting to wear branded gear but also a personal piece of clothing that speaks to Sonny Hayes' personal style.

While Brad Pitt brought grunge star power, Damson Idris brought next-generation cool and aspirational style for younger fans. The actor played a key role in influencing the film's style.

Damson Idris wore the APXGP collection, turning it into a collector's item for fans. But even more so, he embraced the movie's fashion in real life. At the 2025 Met Gala, themed “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” and co-chaired by Lewis Hamilton (also co-producer of F1 The Movie), Idris arrived driving an F1 car in a custom Tommy Hilfiger racing suit. He then dramatically revealed a red custom tuxedo on the red carpet – establishing himself as a fashion risk-taker and a new icon for F1 culture.

From Labubu to Balletcore, today's fashion is dictated by the cultural conversations. A fashion “core” refers to a specific fashion trend or aesthetic, centred around a particular visual style and lifestyle, accompanied also by the attitude of that specific niche. The influence of Formula 1 and F1 The Movie extends beyond official merchandise, tapping into a broader “motorcore” fashion momentum – a trend that mirrors how drivers have become fashion icons as well.

Leather motor jackets, leather trousers, chunky boots, and sneakers like the Puma Speedcats are key elements of the trend, along with visual cues such as sponsor logos and racing stripes. Additionally, the aesthetic is making waves in everyday streetwear, having been embraced by influencers and fashion enthusiasts – making it a relevant and relatable trend for the broader fashion scene.

Motorcore has a strong presence at racing events (especially in places like Monaco or Las Vegas), but has also taken to the streets of fashion capitals and even the runways in Milan and Copenhagen. It is also being applied in music, through stars like Rosalía, Dua Lipa, Rosé or Tate McRae who have all leaned into racing-inspired aesthetics – further amplifying the cultural crossover.

The Tommy Hilfiger APXGP capsule collection is a prime example, offering subtle yet instantly recognisable style for daily wear. On the runways, from Ferrari Style to Diesel, Vetements, Balenciaga, Alaïa, and Jil Sander, designers have debuted racer jackets and leather pieces in their collections.

The result is a more diverse fan fashion landscape during Grand Prix weekends. Not everyone chooses the same team merchandise; instead, fans style it their way, mixing it with streetwear or APXGP pieces to express their identity and passion – making Sundays as much a fashion moment as a racing spectacle.

The movie has sparked fashion evolution inside and outside the sport, and with Cadillac entering in 2026, Tommy Hilfiger will continue the narrative from the F1 movie as the official apparel and lifestyle sponsor of a real F1 team.

Where once the grandstands were dominated by replica team kits, now they are a place of fashion identity for the fandom. From the ones who wear traditional outfits to others who treat the paddock like a runway – together with the sport, they have created a richer and more diverse style culture, where the line between fashion and Formula 1 will continue to blur further.

The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), organizers of the beloved song contest, also said that reports Israel had been asked to compete under a neutral flag are false.

Eurovision 2026 is set to be another contentious one, despite the European Broadcasting Union's attempts to calm the chaos.


	Last week, news broke that Ireland and the Netherlands were threatening to withdraw from next year's song contest, held in Vienna, Austria in May, if Israel is permitted to take part. A statement from Irish broadcaster RTÉ said the decision was made “given the ongoing and appalling loss of lives in Gaza.”




	On Friday, Dutch public broadcaster Avrotros concurred, adding: “Human suffering, the suppression of press freedom and political interference are at odds with the values of public broadcasting.” Similar sentiments have come from Slovenia's RTVSLO and Iceland's RÚV, and calls have been made in neighboring countries — including from musician Phil Coulter in the U.K. — to follow suit.

	Reports then emerged that Israel had been given a choice to either withdraw temporarily this year or compete under a neutral flag, which the EBU has confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter to be false. “The EBU has not made any proposals to [Israeli broadcaster] Kan regarding participation in next year's Eurovision Song Contest,” a spokesperson told THR. “The consultation with the wider EBU membership is ongoing and no decisions will be made until the process concludes.”


	The group said that they “understand the concerns and deeply-held views around the ongoing conflict in the Middle East,” but that EBU members are still being consulted “to gather views on how we manage participation and geopolitical tensions around the Eurovision Song Contest.”

	











	The statement added about other countries sitting out: “Broadcasters have until mid-December to confirm if they wish to take part in next year's event in Vienna. It is up to each Member to decide if they want to take part in the Contest and we would respect any decision broadcasters make.”


	It comes after the 2025 edition of Europe's most popular singing competition proved similarly divisive as widespread protests and boycotts surrounding Israel's participation took place. Before the event, 72 former Eurovision contestants signed an open letter calling for Israel and Kan to be excluded, echoed by the Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez and the contest's 2025 winner, Austrian singer JJ. Israeli entrant Yuval Raphael finished in second place, though her performance was interrupted by protestors attempting to claim the stage.


	It isn't the first time the contest has had to brace itself for geopolitical fallout — Russia has been excluded since 2022 after invading Ukraine — but the unrest among members is proving to be catastrophic for organizers who have yet to find a way through that keeps each country happy.


	In previous years, Eurovision has been seen as a joyous celebration of the best of Europe's over-the-top but gloriously kitschy music-lovers. The world's largest live music contest has been a springboard to fame for some of the biggest acts in history, including legendary Swedish band ABBA or Italian glam rock band Måneskin.

Einbinder won the Emmy for her role as Ava Daniels in 'Hacks.'


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Hannah Einbinder took home her first Emmy on Sunday for best supporting actress in a comedy series for her role in Hacks at the 2025 awards ceremony.


	After being presented the award by Reba McEntire and Little Big Town's Karen Fairchild and Kimberly Schlapman, Einbinder took to the stage, where she said it's “punk rock” to win an Emmy.




	“Thank you so much, wow! I'm thinking out loud here — I was just really committed to the personal narrative that I have that it was actually cooler to continue to lose. I was pretty committed to that, had to be, right? But this is cool too. This is also punk rock!” she said in her acceptance speech.

	An emotional Einbinder also showed her appreciation to the creators of Hacks, Lucia Aniello, Paul W. Downs and Jen Statsky, for “changing my life in every conceivable way, but not just by giving me a great gig, but by being my friends and being my family.”


	“And I wanna thank Jean Smart, who is like the sun and I just get to stand in her warmth,” she continued, “and I also wanna thank the cast and crew of Hacks.”


	At the end of her speech, Einbinder added, “I just wanna say, finally, go birds, fuck ICE and free Palestine.”


	Later, in the press room backstage, she explained that she wanted to speak about Palestine and the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip “because it's an issue that's very close to my heart.”


	“I have friends in Gaza who are working as frontline workers, as doctors, right now in the north of Gaza to provide care for pregnant women and for school children to create schools in refugee camps,” Einbinder continued. “I feel like it's my obligation as a Jewish person to distinguish Jews from the state of Israel because our religion and our culture is such an important and longstanding institution that is really separate to this really ethnonationalist state.”

	











	The actress also explained why she chose to sign the Film Workers for Palestine pledge to boycott working with Israeli film institutions and companies that are “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people.” 


	“It's like many movements — boycotting is an effective tool to create pressure on the powers that be to meet the moment. The Film Workers for Palestine boycott does not boycott individuals, it only boycotts institutions that are directly complicit in the genocide. So it's important to me and I think it's an important measure and I was happy to be a part of it,” Einbinder added.

	Einbinder plays Ava Daniels in Hacks, which explores the ongoing dynamic between her young comedy writer and veteran Vegas comedian Deborah Vance (Jean Smart).


	Other nominees in the supporting actress in a comedy series category included Liza Colón-Zayas for The Bear, Kathryn Hahn for The Studio, Janelle James for Abbott Elementary, Catherine O'Hara for The Studio, Sheryl Lee Ralph for Abbott Elementary and Jessica Williams for Shrinking.


	As for Hacks, it earned 14 Emmy nominations total this year, including for best comedy series and best actress in a comedy series for Smart (which she won), among others.


	The 77th Emmy Awards, hosted by Nate Bargatze, aired live from the Peacock Theater at L.A. LIVE in downtown Los Angeles on Sunday, Sept. 14. Check out all the red carpet arrivals and 2025 Emmy winners.

True courage would have meant calling for peace, for coexistence, for the humanity of both Israelis and Palestinians, even if it risked boos instead of applause, writes Israeli activist Hen Mazzig.


							By 

	Hen Mazzig



As a queer Jew, son of refugees from Iraq and Tunisia (Berber) who has dedicated my life to fighting antisemitism, I read Hannah Einbinder's Emmys-night comments with sadness and fear. When the Hacks actor signed a pledge to boycott Israeli film institutions and used her platform to declare “Free Palestine,” she no doubt believed she was doing something bold, even righteous. But what she did wasn't brave, it was populist. And it was dangerous.There is nothing risky about parroting the most popular slogan in Hollywood. Wearing a pin or signing an open letter won't cost you jobs or red carpet invites — if anything, it buys you applause. But for millions of Jews, it comes with a cost: our safety.The claim that anti-Israel rhetoric is separate from antisemitism collapses under the weight of reality. Jews are attacked on the streets of New York, stabbed in Europe, shot in synagogues in Pittsburgh and Poway — by people who believe the same conspiracy theories anti-Israel activists spread.A Jew being punched in Los Angeles doesn't care that his attacker says it's “about Israel.” He cares that there is a fist in his face.Just this past May, a gunman opened fire outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., during a reception hosted by the American Jewish Committee, killing a Jewish woman and her partner. Witnesses say the shooter shouted, “Free Palestine.” Hannah Einbinder did not condemn it. Instead she repeated it onstage.Hannah should know there is no such thing as a “good Jew” who can launder antisemitism. The “good Jews” trope — the ones who sign boycott pledges or reassure progressives that this isn't about hatred — are always used as cover. They are never enough. And at the end of the day, the people demanding “good Jews” don't actually believe there is anything good about being Jewish.That is why Einbinder's words sting so deeply. She is not just a comedian with a platform — she is a Jewish comedian. When she singles out Israel, the one Jewish state in the world, home to half of global Jewry, she is telling millions of us that the single most unifying part of our identity is illegitimate.But the truth is that according to a Pew Research survey in 2021 more than 80 percent of American Jews say they are pro-Israel. Add to that the half of the world's Jews who live in Israel, and it becomes clear: Zionism is not a fringe ideology. It is the consensus of the Jewish people — the belief that we have a right to live freely and safely in our ancestral homeland after centuries of exile and persecution.To oppose Zionism is not merely to challenge a government policy. It is to challenge Jewish existence as a free people. You can criticize Netanyahu and his government's actions and policies — I know I have, and still hold this truth.Words have consequences. When celebrities make it trendy to vilify Israel, it fuels the climate that leads to Jewish schools under police guard, synagogues set on fire and children beaten on their way to class.True bravery would have been using that Emmy stage to call for the release of the 48 hostages still held in Gaza and end of the war. True courage would have meant calling for peace, for coexistence, for the humanity of both Israelis and Palestinians, even if it risked boos instead of applause.Hannah Einbinder had a rare moment when the world was listening. She could have built a bridge. Instead, she burned one.

She beat out Cate Blanchett, Meghann Fahy, Rashida Jones and Michelle Williams for lead actress in a limited series at the 2025 Emmys.


							By 

	Katherine Schaffstall



The Penguin star Cristin Milioti won the 2025 Emmy for lead actress in a limited series on Sunday, and she reflected on playing the role of Sofia Gigante in her acceptance speech.


	“Thank you so much. I'm so profoundly grateful,” she began, sharing that she wrote her speech on the back of a piece a paper from a recent therapy session. “I loved making this show and I loved playing Sofia so much.”




	The award marks Milioti's first Emmys win, as well as her first nomination. She beat out Disclaimer‘s Cate Blanchett, Sirens‘ Meghann Fahy, Black Mirror‘s Rashida Jones and Dying for Sex‘s Michelle Williams for the honor.

	“It's very hard to make sense of being alive right now in this world and so I'm deeply grateful for the bright spots,” she continued from the awards show stage. “And making this show with our incredible cast and our incredible crew and getting to inhabit this woman was a bright spot for me despite it being, like, very grisly. Playing her felt like flying.”

	After she thanked her “incredible family” in attendance for supporting their “strange kid” and showing her “movies that were very inappropriate for my age,” Milioti thanked her friends. “I have the best friends in the world. You're the reason that I'm standing. You're the whole reason that I've gotten through life,” she said through tears.

	











	Milioti began to wrap up her speech by thanking The Penguin showrunner Lauren LeFranc. “She is the reason our show is so special,” she said. Milioti then thanked her team and several of the people behind the scenes of the show.


	“I love you and I love acting so much!” she concluded.


	After her nomination was announced, Milioti reflected on the nod during an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. “I feel really good, it's so nice. I feel so thrilled for our show,” she said in August. “You never know how these things are going to go, and I'm so blown away by the amount of nominations we have and that so many members of our incredible crew got nominated.”


The Penguin snagged a total of 24 nominations across a wide variety of creative categories at the awards show. Her other series, Black Mirror, was also nominated.


	The 2025 Emmy Awards are hosted by Nate Bargatze and are being held at the Peacock Theater at L.A. LIVE in Los Angeles, which is airing on CBS and streaming on Paramount+ from 5-8 p.m. PT/8-11 p.m. ET.

	“Go Rest High on That Mountain,” originally released in 1995 and the winner of two Grammys in 1996, marks its 30th anniversary this year with the release of an extended version of the song.Gill wrote “Go Rest High on That Mountain” following the death of Keith Whitley in 1989, and the death of his brother Bob in 1993. 




	Sunday's “In Memoriam” performance at the 77th annual Emmy Awards — which were hosted by comedian Nate Bargatze and broadcast on CBS — included a third verse not heard on the original recording of “Go Rest High on That Mountain”: “You're safely home in the arms of Jesus/ Eternal life my brother's found/ The day will come I know I'll see him/ In that sacred place, on that holy ground,” Gill sang.Gill first performed the song with its additional verse in 2019 at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium with wife Amy Grant, later explaining that he'd “always felt like something was missing.”


	The third verse is on Gill's new recording of “Go Rest High on That Mountain” that was released this week, just ahead of the Emmys.

HUNTR/X slays the Archies and the Chipmunks (not literally).


													By
												

	Gary Trust



Saja Boys weren't the only animated singers in HUNTR/X's way.


	HUNTR/X, the heroic trio in Netflix's smash film KPop Demon Hunters, claims a fifth week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 with “Golden” — which becomes the sole longest-leading hit by an animated act in the chart's 67-year history. Two previous cartoon tunes each reigned for four weeks: The Archies, with “Sugar, Sugar” in 1969, and the Chipmunks with David Seville, with “The Chipmunk Song” over the 1958 holiday season.


	Upon the original ascent to No. 1 for “Golden,” HUNTR/X — the IRL singing trio of EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI (in the roles of the movie's characters Rumi, Mira and Zoey) — became the first female group associated with Korean pop to crown the Hot 100.


KPop Demon Hunters has also become the first soundtrack to generate four simultaneous Hot 100 top 10s over the chart's archives. The songs place in the bracket for a fourth week, with Saja Boys' “Your Idol” and “Soda Pop” each up a spot to return to their respective Nos. 4 and 5 bests and HUNTR/X's “How It's Done” lifting one place to a new No. 8 high.


	Meanwhile, KPop Demon Hunters charts three songs in the Hot 100's top five simultaneously for a third week. It surpasses the only other soundtrack that spun off three concurrent top five hits: For two weeks (April 8 and 15, 1978), three Saturday Night Fever songs were all in the top five: Bee Gees' “Night Fever” and “Stayin' Alive” and Yvonne Eliiman's Bee Gees-penned “If I Can't Have You” (at Nos. 1, 2 and 5, respectively).


	As previously reported, the KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack slashes its way to its first week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. Thanks to the set and “Golden,” a soundtrack and one of its songs lead the Billboard 200 and Hot 100, respectively, for the first time since the charts dated March 5, 2022, when Encanto and its ensemble anthem “We Don't Talk About Bruno” wrapped five weeks doubly dominating. (KPop Demon Hunters and Encanto are the only animated films to earn such honors.)


	Browse the full rundown of this week's Hot 100 top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Sept. 20, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Sept. 16.

Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	“Golden,” on Visva/Republic Records, tallied 33.8 million official streams (down 2% week-over-week), 26.3 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 19%) and 8,000 sold (down 11%) in the United States Sept. 5-11. Notably, the song has cleared 30 million streams for six weeks running, the most for a title this year; Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” logged five such weeks.


	“Golden” adds an eighth week at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart; pushes 24-20 on Radio Songs; and dips to No. 3 after two weeks atop Digital Song Sales.


	“Golden” is the ninth song in the realm of Korean pop to rule the Hot 100, and the first by female lead vocalists with ties to the genre. (HUNTR/X singers EJAE and REI AMI were born in Seoul, South Korea; Nuna is from New Jersey.)


	Among those nine, “Golden” becomes just the second to post at least five weeks at No. 1 on the Hot 100:




	Plus, “Golden” ties for the third-longest Hot 100 command for a song by an all-female group of three or more members, dating to the first four-week No. 1 in the category in 1963:




	Elsewhere in the Hot 100's top 10, Alex Warren's “Ordinary” keeps at No. 2, after 10 nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 beginning in June. It adds a 13th frame at No. 1 on Radio Songs, up 3% to 75.1 million in audience; it's the first song this year to reach 75 million in weekly reach, and the first since Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” last October. Warren performed “Ordinary” (in a medley with fellow ballad “Eternity”) Sept. 7 on the MTV Video Music Awards, broadcast on CBS; it also gained by 1% to 23.2 million streams in the tracking week.


	Two songs by Sabrina Carpenter sandwich Saja Boys' Hot 100 top 10s: “Manchild,” which led in its debut week in June, rises 4-3 and “Tears,” which Carpenter performed on the VMAs, drops 3-6 in its second week on the chart.


	Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, holds at No. 7, after it reigned in its first week in May , becoming Wallen's fourth No. 1 and McRae's first. It posts a 17th week atop the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart.


	Below HUNTR/X's “How It's Done,” which leads the Hot Dance/Pop Songs chart for an 11th week, Ravyn Lenae's “Love Me Not” falls 8-9 on the Hot 100, after hitting No. 5, and Justin Bieber's No. 2-peaking “Daisies” returns to the top 10 (11-10).

Many voters rallied behind Colbert for reasons that went beyond simply admiring his show. 


													By
												

	Paul Grein



The Late Show With Stephen Colbert won outstanding talk series at the 2025 Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday (Sept. 14), two months after CBS's stunning announcement on July 17 that they were canceling the show. Stephen Colbert‘s win was greeted with a standing ovation at the Ovation Theater at L.A. Live.


	Actually, Colbert received a standing ovation even before he won, when he presented the first award of the night. “While I have your attention, is anyone hiring?,” he joked. “'Cause I've got 200 very well-qualified candidates with me here tonight who'll be available in June. I also brought my own resume with me tonight.”

	











	When Colbert won the Emmy, later in the broadcast, he took the high road. “I want to thank CBS for giving us the privilege of being part of the late-night tradition, which I hope continues long after we're no longer doing this show.” He concluded his remarks with a comment that suggested he is looking to his post-CBS future. “If the elevator tries to bring you down, go cray and punch a higher floor.” (He borrowed the line from Prince's and the Revolution‘s 1984 hit “Let's Go Crazy,” a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100.)




			Trending on Billboard		







	This was Colbert's 11th career Emmy, but it was his program's first win in that top category, following eight consecutive losses. Colbert's previous show, The Colbert Report, won back-to-back awards in a predecessor category, outstanding variety series, in 2013-14. As an executive producer of the show, Jon Stewart won his 25th Primetime Emmy. He is closing in on the all-time Emmy winner, producer Sheila Nevins, who has won 31 awards.


	The other nominees in the category were Jimmy Kimmel Live! and The Daily Show.


Jimmy Kimmel Live! lost a top program award for the 14th consecutive year, though this year wasn't really a fair contest. Many voters rallied behind Colbert for reasons that went beyond simply admiring his show. Jimmy Kimmel's program was nominated three times for outstanding variety series and now 11 times for outstanding variety talk series.


The Daily Show was last year's winner in this category. In addition, The Daily Show With Jon Stewart won 11 times and The Daily Show With Trevor Noah won once.


	Comedian Nate Bargatze hosted the show, which, by coincidence, aired on CBS, the network that received industry ire for axing Colbert. (The three legacy networks – ABC, CBS and NBC – and Fox air the show on a rotating basis.)


SNL50 topped The Apple Music Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show Starring Kendrick Lamar, Beyoncé Bowl, SNL50: The Homecoming Concert and The Oscars to win for outstanding variety special (live).


	There were two musical performances on the show. Reba McEntire and the two women from Little Big Town – Karen Fairchild and Kimberly Schlapman – sang the theme song from The Golden Girls, which debuted on NBC 40 years ago to the day. Andrew Gold wrote and first recorded the song, “Thank You for Being a Friend,” in 1978, when it reached No. 25 on the Billboard Hot 100.

	











	Vince Gill and Lainey Wilson performed Gill's 1995 hit “Go Rest High on That Mountain” as this year's In Memoriam song. The song reached No. 14 on Hot Country Songs and won the Grammy and the CMA Award for song of the year. The In Memoriam spot included numerous people who had a music tie-in, including such legends as Quincy Jones and Ozzy Osbourne; Robin Kaye, the American Idol music supervisor who was killed by an intruder in her home;   variety TV producers Don Mischer, Gary Smith and Allan Blye; directors Jeff Margolis and Marty Callner; composers Mark Snow and Alf Clausen; choreographer Judith Jamison; and Hot 100 hitmaker-turned-game-show-host Wink Martindale.   


The Studio was the top winner across the three nights of the 2025 Primetime Emmy Awards – two nights of Creative Arts Emmys and now the main primetime telecast. The comedy won a total of 13 Primetime Emmys this season, setting a new record for the most Emmys for a comedy series in a single season. The old record was held by The Bear, which won 11 awards in 2024.


	Seth Rogan personally won four awards for his work on The Studio, tying the all-time record for most Primetime Emmys in one year. The feat was previously accomplished by Moira Demos (Making a Murderer, 2016), Amy Sherman-Palladino (Fleabag, 2018) and Dan Levy (Schitt's Creek, 2020).


	Other programs that won three or more Primetime Emmys this year across the three nights of awards were: The Penguin (nine); Adolescence, Severance and SNL50: The Anniversary Special (eight each); and Andor, The Pitt and The Traitors (five each).


	Jean Smart, 73, won her seventh career Emmy for her leading role in Hacks. Kathy Bates, 77, won her third career Emmy for her leading role in the reboot of Matlock. Catherine O'Hara, 71, won her third career award for her supporting role in The Studio. Harrison Ford, 83, won his first Emmy for his supporting role in Shrinking. (Just by being nominated, Bates become the oldest nominee in that category to date.)

	











	Smart has won more Emmys in acting categories than anyone else in the 2000s. In all of Emmy history, she is just one shy of the all-time record of eight acting awards shared by Cloris Leachman and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Smart has won four times for Hacks since 2021, twice for Frasier (2000 and '21), and once for Samantha Who (2008).


	At the other end of the age spectrum, Owen Cooper, 15, won outstanding supporting actor in a limited or anthology series or movie for Adolescence, becoming the youngest male actor ever to win a Primetime Emmy. He edges out Scott Jacoby, who was 16 when he won in 1973 for Seven time Emmy winneoutstanding performance by an actor in a supporting role in drama for playing the son of a gay dad in That Certain Summer, an ABC Movie of the Week that was groundbreaking for the time.


	Two actresses have won at even younger ages:  Roxana Zal, who was just 14 when she won outstanding supporting actress in a limited series or special for Something About Amelia in 1984, and Kristy MacNichol, who won outstanding continuing performance by a supporting actress in a drama series for Family on her 15th birthday (not a bad present).

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: Deadline can reveal the first look image and poster for Korean filmmaker Na Hong-Jin's (The Wailing) anticipated sci-fi thriller Hope, starring Hwang Jung-min, Zo In-sung, Hoyeon, Taylor Russell, Alicia Vikander, Cameron Britton and Michael Fassbender. You can see both below.


	The teaser poster uses a direct frame from the film, capturing “a moment in the depths of the forest as a rider on a galloping horse seizes a young man by the collar, saving him just as he is pursued by an alien threat”.


	Filmed in Retezat National Park in Romania, we're told the sequence proved to be very demanding, requiring exact synchronization between actor, horse, rigging, and camera, and a long period of training for cast and crew, including cinematographer Alex Hong, who wanted to capture the shot in natural light at 120 frames per second despite the covering of the forest. Hong is well known for his work on Parasite and Burning and worked with Na on The Wailing.

	Described as Na's most ambitious project to date, the sci-fi action thriller is set in the remote village of Hope Harbor, near the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). When a tiger is suspected to have appeared and local police chief Bum-seok is alerted, it throws the community into chaos. What begins as a local emergency soon spirals into a deeper, more terrifying mystery, one that forces the town's residents to confront the unknown.

	Hwang Jung-min plays Bum-seok, the arrogant yet duty-bound chief of the Hope Harbor police substation. Zo In-sung portrays Sung-ki, a young local who passes his days hunting and fishing. Hoyeon appears as Sung-ae, a tenacious officer who remains steadfast in her duties under any circumstance. They are joined by international stars Taylor Russell, Cameron Britton, with Alicia Vikander and Michael Fassbender, in the roles of the film's alien characters.


	The largely Korean language film, still in post-production, is slated for a summer 2026 release, with international sales handled by Plus M Entertainment and UTA Independent Film Group representing North America. Producers are Na's production banner Forged Films and Plus M Entertainment.

	











	The project is the director's first since 2016 box office hit and Cannes entry The Wailing.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


Karen Attiah, a columnist for The Washington Post who also served as global opinions editor, wrote that she was fired by the publication over her social media posts in the aftermath of the assassination of Charlie Kirk. 


	Attiah posted a Substack column on Monday in which she wrote that Post bosses “accused my measured Bluesky posts of being ‘unacceptable,' ‘gross misconduct' and of endangering the physical safety of colleagues — charges without evidence, which I reject completely as false.” 


	“They rushed to fire me without even a conversation,” she wrote. “This was not only a hasty overreach, but a violation of the very standards of journalistic fairness and rigor the Post claims to uphold.”

	In her Substack column, Attiah included screenshots of some of her social media posts, including one late in the afternoon on Wednesday, a couple hours after the shooting, in which she wrote, “I wish I had hope for gun control and that I could believe ‘political violence has no place in this country.' But we live in a country that accepts white children being massacred by gun violence. Not just accepts, but worships violence.”


	“Part of what keeps America so violent is the insistence that people perform care, empty goodness and absolution for white men who espouse hatred and violence…Again. I don't care for empty rhetoric.”


	She also posted one of Kirk's quotes, that “Black women do not have the brain processing power to be taken seriously. You have to go steal a white person's slot.” Social media has been rife with claims of what Kirk has said in the past, but Snopes rated the Black women quote, from a podcast in 2023, as true.


	A spokesperson for The Washington Post declined to comment on personnel matters. The Post has pointed to its policies and standards, including its social media policy. 


	Attiah continued to post on Bluesky in the hours and days after the shooting, defending her criticisms. “Refusing to tear my clothes and smear ashes on my face in performative mourning for a white man that espoused violence…is not the same as violence,” she wrote.

	











	Attiah, who joined the Post in 2014, was a prominent voice speaking out on the killing of columnist Jamal Khashoggi by agents of the Saudi regime. Her Substack post included a photo of her with Post owner Jeff Bezos, taken at the 2019 Gridiron dinner. She also noted in Substack that she was the last remaining Black full-time opinion columnist at the Post, which has seen an exodus amid some of Bezos' new editorial mandates and a buyout offer earlier this year.

She said nothing wrong. She should try and sue the Washington Post for trying to stop her from using her 1st amendment right. Everybody has the right to freedom of speech as long as the don't physically threatened anybody and as long as they don't threaten to steal from anybody.

Unfair to Richard Nixon. Why couldn't Jeff Bezos own the Post when Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward were reporting on Watergate?

The Washington Post is no longera player in the USA 5th estate. It's dead!

She did nothing wrong.

She should sue them.

On what grounds? Most major companies have policies against posting things that make the company look bad.

Senior Managing Editor


Netflix has dropped the full trailer for Monster: The Ed Gein Story, starring Charlie Hunnam as the crazed killer. The streamer also released some first-look photos (see below). The limited series premieres October 3 on Netflix.


	From Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan, the series tells the story of serial killer, grave robber, and psycho Ed Gein. In the frozen fields of 1950s rural Wisconsin, a friendly, mild-mannered recluse named Eddie Gein (Hunnam) lived quietly on a decaying farm – hiding a house of horrors so gruesome it would redefine the American nightmare.


	Driven by isolation, psychosis, and an all-consuming obsession with his mother, Gein's perverse crimes birthed a new kind of monster that would haunt Hollywood for decades. From Psycho to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre to The Silence of the Lambs, Gein's macabre legacy gave birth to fictional monsters born in his image. It ignited a cultural obsession with the criminally deviant. Ed Gein didn't just influence a genre — he became the blueprint for modern horror.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Known as the Butcher of Plainfield or the Plainfield Ghoul, Gein confessed to murdering two women in the 1950s and also allegedly made trophies out of bodies and skin of corpses he exhumed from graveyards. He is suspected of having been responsible for the deaths of others, including his brother Henry, but the authorities were unable to connect him definitively to any of the cases.


	The cast also includes Laurie Metcalf as Gein's mother, Augusta; Tom Hollander as Hitchcock, with Olivia Williams playing his wife Alma Reville; Addison Rae as Evelyn Hartley; Charlie Hall as Deputy Frank Worden, and Suzanna Son, in an unknown role. Olivia Williams, Lesley Manville, Joey Pollari, Tyler Jacob Moore, Mimi Kennedy, Will Brill, and Robin Weigert also star.

	











	Monster: The Ed Gein Story is executive produced by Ryan Murphy, Ian Brennan, Max Winkler, Eric Kovtun, Scott Robertson, Nissa Diederich, Louise Shore, Carl Franklin, and Charlie Hunnam. This season, Brennan will write and direct episodes 304 and 305, with Winkler tackling all the other Season 3 episodes up to the finale 308.


	Watch the trailer above.

Jeez, I mean what can one say about something so tasteless, dumb, and derivative?
I'm not even talking about the subject matter here. Every subject should be on the table, theoretically. But some subjects require a different, more nuanced, and much smarter set of tools instead of this same one-trick approach. Our industry has given Murphy a blank cultural check that he can spend however he wants and then they promote his shows so much they always do well, enough, more or less.
But at what point can we be done, at least, with his tedious, embarassingly horny, and puerile horror brand. It's only very rarely scary, it's never terribly enlightening, and it always feels like it makes the audience slightly worse people for having watched it.

					By Max Goldbart 

International TV Co-Editor


Channel 4 is planning a slightly different take on Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK. 


	The UK's irreverent network has revealed a “night of TV dedicated to Donald Trump untruths” that will take place in two days' time when the POTUS arrives at the home of his golf courses and ancestors.


Trump v The Truth is described as an “unbroken catalogue of over 100 falsehoods, distortions and inaccuracies uttered or written by the US President since taking office in January.” Running over several hours, these statements will be punctuated by brief text-based fact-checks, which Channel 4 said will “offer viewers the truth behind the tweets, speeches and soundbites.”

	On the same night, Channel 4 will air the second ep of The Donald Trump Show, a three-part documentary from Jimmy Savile: A British Horror Story indie 72 Films that “uses news footage from TV, podcasts and social media to tell the story of the last nine months of the presidency as an unfolding soap opera.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Ian Katz, who oversees content for Channel 4, said: “Donald J Trump loves making history. So, on Wednesday Channel 4 will do just that: we'll show what we believe to be the longest uninterrupted reel of untruths, falsehoods and distortions ever broadcast on television. We hope it will remind viewers how disorientating and dangerous the world becomes when the most powerful man on earth shows little regard for the truth. And if President Trump cares to watch along after the state banquet, he may even clear up a few misconceptions.” 

	











	Channel 4 is no stranger to these kinds of stunts. Just prior to the 2019 general election, the network replaced then-Conservative candidate Boris Johnson with a block of melting ice after he refused to participate in a debate about climate change. Channel 4 also made a Partygate factual drama about the notorious scandal that brought down Johnson's government nearly three years later.


	Trump arrives in the UK in two days at what is an awkward time for UK-U.S. relations after Peter Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the States, was stood down owing to his links with Jeffrey Epstein, the now-deceased serial sex offender who has been causing Trump a fair few problems on the other side of the pond. Protests against Trump's visit are planned in Central London on Wednesday. Trump has Scottish ancestry and is a huge fan of the UK.

We need this now more than ever. How can we see this in the USA?  He's destroying this country.

I went to YouTube and searched for “Trump lies.” I just about broke the internet with all the videos it brought up.

This is pathetic…

When Ian Katz was at the Guardian, he ran the letter writing campaign to try and get people in Ohio to vote democrat, which backfired spectacularly. This stunt feels right out of the same lame, sixth form common room playbook. 

Channel 4 is an embarrassment!

The fact that it's using news clips should tell us everything.  The news sources are corrupt and state lies everyday.  Then when confronted with the truth they don't retract their false statements.  Sounds like a TV show of comedy to me.

Quit drinking Trump's Koolaide.listen and believe the facts.

Executive Editor, Awardsline


	On Sunday night fans of Apple TV+ comedy The Studio were asking, Why didn't anyone thank Sal Saperstein? After all, the show's “Golden Globes” episode had a running bit on exactly that.


	In that episode featuring the awards show, Seth Rogen‘s beleaguered studio exec Matt Remick is devastated when his fellow exec Sal Saperstein, played by Ike Barinholtz, is repeatedly thanked by stars in their acceptance speeches, including by the show's guest star Zoë Kravitz, playing herself. 


	Following a total of 13 wins for The Studio Sunday night, including for Comedy Series and for Rogen as Lead Actor in a Comedy, not one person thanked the fictional Saperstein! Backstage, speaking to the press, Rogen explained why.

	











	“It's our own joke,” he said. “It feels weird to reference your own joke in my opinion.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	“I'm very disappointed,” Barinholtz cut in.


	Rogen was also asked if Apple CEO Tim Cook will join the long list of The Studio‘s guest stars, for Season 2. Rogen said, “I met him last night for the first time, and he said he was a fan of the show, which was very nice. I'm on another show on Apple [Platonic]. He didn't say he was a fan of that one. So, I believed him. We know he's honest, and I don't know, I hope we all get free iPhones out of this or something.”


	In the wake of all the Emmy wins for The Studio Season 1, Rogen also said he was going to “follow up” with a bunch of celebrities on his recruiting mission for Season 2 big name guest stars. “I hope if anyone was on the fence, this would maybe kick them over to the other side, but I don't know,” he said. “So far it's, it's been the same, I would say, but yeah, there's a few people I'm gonna follow up with tomorrow with a little more bounce in my step than maybe I had before. Literally, as I was standing on the stage, I was looking out at the crowd, being like, ‘Oh, maybe he'll do it now.' I do hope to parlay this into better episodes next year.”

TV Reporter


	There were plenty of noteworthy moments from Sunday night's 77th Primetime Emmy Awards, from Hannah Einbinder's “f*ck ICE and free Palestine” speech to Tramell Tillman becoming the first Black actor to win Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series.


	But some of the most intriguing moments actually happened off camera. Deadline was in attendance at tonight's show, keeping an eye on everything unfolding when and where the cameras weren't rolling. Here's some of what we saw:


Stephen Colbert was the man of the hourAs soon as The Late Show‘s Stephen Colbert hit the stage early in the night to present the award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series (which went to The Studio‘s Seth Rogen), he was met with a massive round of applause and a 30-second standing ovation. But what you might not have heard were the invigorated “Stephen! Stephen!” as the crowd began chanting for the late-night host. He also got a rousing and extended round of applause when he won Outstanding Talk Series later in the night. The chants returned, too. Really, the crowd was going crazy.

The pair exchanged a huge hug, seemingly excited to see each other just a few minutes before Hiller won his first Emmy Award.

A very buzzy concession standThere were lots of star-studded interactions happening in the lobby of Downtown L.A.'s Peacock Theater, where Emmy-goers could grab concessions from cocktails to popcorn. Step out during any commercial break, and you were bound to run a star or two, like Taika Waititi and Rita Ora or The Bear‘s Liza Colón-Zayas (and her husband David Zayas) and Abby Elliott all snagging some snacks in between awards. Jason Isaacs and Sam Rockwell got stopped by a few drag queens eager to say hello to The White Lotus actors. Their co-star Aimee Lou Wood also got stopped for some photos while grabbing a drink.

Service dog in the lobby –– everyone wants to stop and say helloEven with TV's biggest stars in attendance, the most sought-after interaction was with a service dog accompanying an Emmys guest. Everyone, and we mean everyone, was eager to get their moment with the furry guest of honor.

Kimmel even gave Colbert a friendly kiss on the cheek before snapping a photo.

When we say everyone, we mean just about everyone jumped to their feet when the newcomer won for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or TV Movie, becoming the youngest male actor winner in history.

The boos and the cheersThe audience always can be heard from the telecast, though sometimes their sentiments are hard to parse out. Let's just say there were a lot of boos when Television Academy chairman Chris Abrego mentioned Congress' defunding of public broadcasting. On the other hand, there were a ton of cheers when mentioning Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen's support of the LGBTQ community specifically.


Hannah Einbinder's mention of ICE and Palestine also got quite a bit of support in the room even though CBS parent company Paramount denounced a recent open letter from thousands of members behind Film Workers for Palestine, who announced a boycott of Israeli film institutions that are “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people.” Inspired by the 1987 pledge made by the Filmmakers United Against Apartheid movement, FWP noted its goal “takes aim at institutional complicity, not identity,” decrying Paramount “misrepresenting the pledge in an attempt to silence our colleagues in the film industry.”

	Those with the loudest applause during the In Memoriam segment: Ozzy Osbourne, John Amos, Maggie Smith, David Lynch and Quincy Jones. Interestingly, Severance commanded much more applause than The Pitt, even though the latter beat the former in a majority of the categories they competed in.


Scarlett Johansson racing back to her seat, cocktails in handWith just over an hour left in the show, Scarlett Johansson was spotted rushing back to her seat as the ushers urged everyone to clear the aisles mere seconds before the end of another commercial break. She clearly was coming from concessions, as illustrated by the two cocktails in hand. She was, of course, in attendance with her Emmy-winning husband Colin Jost. The couple snuck out of the show a bit early, aforementioned Emmy in tow, just ahead of Noah Wyle's win for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Task kicks into high gear","https://www.avclub.com/task-recap-season-1-episode-2-family-statements","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 03:03:00 GMT","

If Task weren't a serious HBO drama, it could make for a pretty good Coen brothers-esque crime caper. Two thieves head into a trap house to grab some easy cash only to wind up with four dead bodies, a kidnapped kid, and a bag full of 12 kilos of drugs they didn't know they were stealing. It sounds like the plot of a dark comedy, particularly when you've got a crime lord snarling “How the fuck did they know about the shipment?” like he's been outsmarted by a couple of masterminds. Between that and a young woman shocked to discover the fiancé she's only known for a few weeks is a burglar, there's something that could be—and sometimes is—slightly comical about the show's increasingly complicated story threads. 

In my recap of last week's premiere, I wondered if there would be enough plot to keep this series driving forward. But after a slow-burn, character-centric debut, “Family Statements” kicks the season into high gear with more than enough story to fill seven episodes. After the first installment narrowed its focus to the parallel stories of Mark Ruffalo's FBI Agent Tom Brandis and Tom Pelphrey's burglar/kidnapper Robbie Prendergast, this second one expands out to a whole world of organized crime. 

Specifically, it's the world of outlaw motorcycle clubs. As we learned last week, Robbie's break-ins largely centered on trap houses connected to the Dark Hearts biker gang. Now we get to see that group in action as they process the death of three of their own, the loss of a giant stash of drugs, and the kidnapping of young Sam (Ben Doherty). 

While the premiere mostly relied on vibes and inference, this hour delivers much more of a traditional exposition dump. As DJ Grassanova—sorry Agent Anthony Grasso—helpfully explains, the Delaware County chapter of the Dark Hearts is headed up by president Jayson Wilkes (Sam Keeley), a former wayward teen who was mentored by national “mother club” leader Perry Dorazo (Jamie McShane). Rumor has it that Perry murdered the last Delco president to speed up Jayson's rise to power. And Jayson then shifted the group's focus from heroin and cocaine to fentanyl. While Freddy Frias (Elvis Nolasco) and his Dominican biker gang handle the city of Philadelphia, Jayson's crew handles the rural communities from Lancaster County to New York—a business that's made them the second largest drug traffickers in the Northeast. 

That's bad news for Robbie. It's one thing to kidnap a kid. It's another to kidnap a kid who a terrifying biker gang considers family. But it turns out that's not Robbie's only personal connection to the Dark Hearts. His beloved brother Billy was actually a member of the club until he was beaten to death by Jayson because of a “rules violation.” And Billy's time in the Dark Hearts means his daughter Maeve is intimately familiar with the club's inner workings as well. It doesn't take her long to piece together the fact that Sam's parents are—well, were—members. And one quick internet search later, she realizes just how much trouble Robbie is in. (As Cliff put it last week, “People. They can just google you nowadays.”)  

While it's a little jarring to jump headfirst into the world of Dark Hearts after last week's premiere had such a narrow focus, the personal connections between Robbie and the biker gang help keep things grounded. Without those bonds, Task would be telling a more familiar story about stolen drugs, the thieves trying to sell them, and the crime lords who want them back. But with so much emotional baggage in the mix, Task is able to stay more personal and less abstract. This is a story about Robbie fucking up his own life by making terrible, impulsive decisions (even if he's really sweet with Sam on a personal level). But it's also a story about how those decisions fall back on those he loves too. As we see when Peaches' fiancée and her dad are attacked, Dark Hearts aren't above coming after the family members of their enemies. 

That's also bad news for Agent Tom Brandis, considering Jayson and Perry know he's leading the task force looking into the incident. But, for now, Tom's problems are closer to home. After last week left things ambiguous, we get much more clarity on Tom's family life. It turns out his older daughter Sara (Phoebe Fox) is alive and (mostly) well. She lives in Chicago with her husband and their new baby. But when she flies in for her brother's sentencing, all the lightly repressed family trauma comes rising to the surface. From the moment Sara only tentatively hugs her sister Emily, it's clear there's a deep divide in the Brandis family. 

As was suggested last week, we get confirmation that Ethan killed his mom while off his meds, throwing her down the stairs and breaking her neck. And we also learn that Emily and Ethan are bio siblings who were adopted into the Brandis family, while Sara is a biological child—a fact she cruelly weaponizes. For Sara, keeping Ethan locked up as long as possible seems like the only answer. But for Tom and especially Emily, the calculus isn't so simple. As Emily tells her therapist, it seems inhumane to keep Ethan in prison where he won't be able to get the mental help he needs. (She implies they had a tough childhood before the adoption.) Yet the idea of him getting out terrifies her just as much. 

In that way, “Family Statements” becomes an episode about moral dilemmas and the people who are or aren't capable of tackling them head-on. We learn that before Tom officially joined the FBI as an agent in 2003, he worked with them as a volunteer chaplain during mass casualty events like the Columbine shooting and the Oklahoma City bombing. Yet during his own crisis event, he's frozen. Tom remains uncertain about how to handle Ethan's sentencing, even as his two daughters are more confident in their polar-opposite perspectives. Similarly, it's Maeve who makes an immediate decision about what to do with Sam as Robbie and Cliff hem and haw—even if her plan ultimately goes completely awry. 

Indeed, the end of this episode introduces another note of dark comedy as Maeve drops Sam at a random store and calls the authorities to report his location, only to discover he's snuck back into her car by the time the police show up. It's a full-on comedy of errors that would be funny if it weren't so tense. Of all the ways I thought the crime and FBI halves of the show might meet, Maeve getting herself into and then out of a complicated ruse certainly wasn't one of them. (It was quick thinking on her part to stop the police from searching her trunk by claiming she saw Sam at her arcade job, though!)  

Task also introduces its first true ongoing mystery as we learn there's a mole in the Dark Hearts who's been feeding Robbie information. That fact—along with all the plot we get this week—makes “Family Statement” a crucial stepping stone toward narrative momentum. This episode still has hints of the poeticism we saw last week, like when Tom finds Emily hiding out at the place where Ethan once hid or when sweet little Sam shares all his empathetic animal musings with Robbie. But for the most part, this is Task in a more practical mode, putting up the scaffolding for the rest of the season to build on.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Emmys 2025: The best, worst, and weirdest moments","https://www.avclub.com/emmys-2025-best-worst-weirdest-moments","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 08:28:00 GMT","

After all of that predicting, The Studio proved to be the big winner at the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday, with the Apple TV+ show becoming the most awarded comedy to date and its star, Seth Rogen, tying for most individual wins in an evening. Adolescence also had a great night, nabbing six awards, while HBO Max's The Pitt bested Severance for the coveted Outstanding Drama Series trophy. (Check out the full list of winners.) Nate Bargatze hosted the festivities at Los Angeles' Peacock Theater, and the ceremony had its fair share of great, grating, and generally confounding moments. Here are The A.V. Club‘s takeaways from TV's big night. 



It's daunting to stand up on a glitzy stage in front of Hollywood bigwigs and host an awards show with the confidence and wit of, say, Conan O'Brien. And in his first attempt, a visibly nervous Nate Bargatze looked like he wanted to be anywhere but the Emmys. He kept beating the drum of that charity-countdown bit (more on that in a minute), and far too few of his jokes landed. But maybe the guy will get another hosting gig at Saturday Night Live, considering the hat tip he gave Lorne Michaels. [Saloni Gajjar] 



There was an almost surprising lack of political talk early on in the telecast, especially considering that the night's first presenter was Stephen Colbert. But then Hannah Einbinder wrapped up her speech for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series with a pointed “Go Birds, fuck ICE, and free Palestine.” (Support for Palestine was also made on the red carpet before the ceremony.) Near the end of the broadcast, Colbert returned to the stage, as his show predictably won for Outstanding Talk Series. And in a tasteful speech, he said that he originally “wanted to do a late-night show that was about love,” a sentiment that sadly almost feels like a statement in this climate. And after talking about the connection between love and loss, he noted that he's “never loved his country more desperately.” [Tim Lowery]   

Bargatze took the wonderful idea of donating to a charity, the Boys & Girls Clubs Of America, and turned into a tiresome bit where that donation shrunk for every second of a speech that went long. (Did he not learn from Anthony Anderson's mom heckling winners last year?) It was tough to sit through, especially when that counter popped up mid-speech. Next time, just to stick to orchestral music to remind folks that they need to wrap things up. [Saloni Gajjar] 



Anyone who's seen Severance knows that it's hard to keep your eyes off of Tramell Tillman as he brings the eerie Mr. Milchick to life. And now, the show's breakout star is the first Black man to nab Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. (Not even presenter Jason Bateman mispronouncing his name can take away from this historic win.) After not being nominated for season one, Tillman beat peers Zach Cherry and John Turturro in this category, dedicating his lovely speech to his mother and giving her a shout-out for being his “first acting coach.” [Saloni Gajjar] 



This riff on Bargatze's “Washington's Dream” sketch was a real sign of how lackluster his performance as host was about to be. Adding to the tired “Is The Bear a drama or a comedy?” and “Is Severance hard to understand?” discourse is a convenient way out of delivering something actually funny or biting. The six-minute-long ordeal, co-starring SNL‘s Mikey Day, Bowen Yang, and James Austin Johnson, had its moments though, like when it referred to CBS (which aired the Emmys) as the “Caucasian Broadcast System.” [Saloni Gajjar] 



The first moment of the evening that gave me a nice buzz was Jeff Hiller's surprising—and deserved!—win for Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series over favorites like The Bear‘s Ebon Moss-Bachrach and The Studio‘s Ike Barinholtz. Hiller's joy was infectious, with the performer saying that “for the last 25 years, I've been like, ‘World, I want to be an actor.' And the world's like, ‘Maybe computers.'” He wasn't the only unforeseen but by no means undeserving winner tonight: It was also great to see Andor‘s Dan Gilroy accepting onstage for Writing For A Drama Series and Slow Horses‘ Adam Randall for Directing for a Drama Series. [Tim Lowery]  

Maybe it's because they were back to back, but the intros for Supporting Actor in a Drama Series (by Jason Bateman and Jude Law) and Lead Actress in a Drama Series (by Angela Bassett) really stood out as leaning far into hyperbolic, we-get-it territory when it comes to describing the craft of performing. (Saloni rightfully Slacked me that “this is the stuff that the timer or countdown or whatever should be for.”) Bateman saying that these actors “deepened the emotion arcs of every episode” and then Law chiming in that “they make every scene they are in undeniably memorable” and then Bassett telling us that “they gave us a masterclass in acting that was just electrifying” was too much. [Tim Lowery]  

Against all odds, Cris Abrego delivered arguably the night's most memorable speech, discussing how Congress defunded the Corporation For Public Broadcasting (which was met with boos) and the cultural impact of shows like Sesame Street and Finding Your Roots on smaller communities. “In a time when division dominates the headlines, storytelling still has the power to unite us,” he said, citing everything from M.A.S.H to South Park to the work of Norman Lear. “In moments like this, neutrality is not enough,” he added. “We must be voices for connection, inclusion, and empathy because we know that culture doesn't come from the top down. It rises from the bottom up.” [Saloni Gajjar] 

Despite her historically entertaining kookiness at awards shows, Jennifer Coolidge ramblings about fan-casting herself on The Pitt just didn't land. And the banter between The Studio co-stars and Emmy nominees Kathryn Hahn and Ike Barinholtz, who pretended to hate writers only to realize how desperately they needed them when the prompter went out, didn't quite either. (However, Ray Romano and Brad Garrett, who had some real chemistry in a funny presentation as the evening was winding down, felt like a refreshing change of pace.) [Saloni Gajjar]  



Adolescence having such a big night wasn't a surprise—and neither was the raw, from-the-heart energy that Stephen Graham brought to his speeches. “I'm just a mixed-race kid from a block of flats in a place called Kirkby,” he told the audience during his acceptance of Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie. And later in the night, when the show got the win for Limited or Anthology Series, he noted: “So whether or not you were an executive producer…or you were the fella that was cleaning the toilets in our Winnebagos, we were all equal. So just look after each other, and give your mates a cuddle or a kiss and tell them that you love them.” [Tim Lowery]   

When John Oliver lands a win for Scripted Variety Series, he shouldn't have to speed through this victory lap because of Nate Bargatze's countdown. And yet, that's exactly what happened with him and a bunch of other folks throughout the night. Mercifully, 15-year-old Owen Cooper was spared from the timer being displayed. If anything had to be cut, it should have been some of the more bloated bits by presenters. [Saloni Gajjar]  

Not long after the 2025 nominations were announced in July, Variety reported that this was the “worst showing for actors of color in five years.” And that's despite a few historic gains and record noms for Abbott Elementary‘s Quinta Brunson, SNL‘s Bowen Yang, and The Bear‘s Ayo Edebiri. As for the actual winners, besides Tramell Tillman earning the trophy, the major Primetime Emmys were overwhelmingly awarded to white performers, directors, and writers. [Saloni Gajjar]

At the 2025 Emmys, host Nate Bargatze has attempted to keep the winners on track by deducting $1,000 from a fund for the Boys & Girls Clubs Of America for every second their speech runs past 45. There have been a few people to go over and a few to go under, but it took less than an hour for someone to outright say “I don't care” and go well past the time limit. That person was Hannah Einbinder, who won her first-ever Emmy for her supporting performance in Hacks. 

When Einbinder noticed that the dollars had begun dropping during her speech, she said, “Oh, I'll pay the difference, sorry,” to apparent laughs in the room. “Finally, I just wanna say, go birds, fuck ICE, and free Palestine. Thank you.” The extra time apparently cost the Boys & Girls Clubs about $20,000, at least out of Bargatze's pocket. Returning after the commercial break, Bargatze also threatened to start a swear jar while commenting on Einbinder saying “fuck ICE.” 

Einbinder's statement came after both her Hacks co-star and Monsters star Javier Bardem spoke out in support of Palestine on the red carpet. Ruth Negga, Chris Perfetti, and Aimee Lou Wood also wore Artists4Ceasefire pins on their outfits for the evening.

The red carpet for an awards show may be mostly for softball questions and name-dropping designers, but at least two actors at this year's Emmy Awards used the the time to lend support to the people of Gaza and Palestine as a whole. First was Hacks‘ and Too Much‘s Meg Stalter, who arrived at the ceremony with a bag with “CEASE FIRE!” written on it in marker. And while Stalter's most recent red carpet looks have ventured into high camp, she instead showed up to the Emmys in a T-shirt and jeans. “You're allowed to do what you want,” when asked about the jeans by Variety. As far as the bag, Stalter said, “It's most important to stick up for people and for peace… We have to use our platforms and say what's important to us. What's the point of being at these big events if you're not going to use your privilege?” 

Monsters star Javier Bardem was even more explicit, wearing a keffiyeh around his neck. “I am here today denouncing the genocide in Gaza,” he told Variety. “I'm talking about the IAGS, which is International Association of Genocide Scholars, who study thoroughly genocide and has declared it is a genocide. And that's why we ask for a commercial and democratic blockade and also sanctions on Israel to stop the genocide. Free Palestine.” Bardem has been frequently outspoken in support of the Palestinian people, signing a letter earlier this month pledging to boycott Israeli film institutions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Reba McEntire's Engagement: See Her Unique Ring! (PHOTOS)","https://entertainmentnow.com/the-voice/reba-mcentire-engagement-ring/","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 13:34:02 GMT","

Country superstar Reba McEntire had a very big night at the 2025 Emmys on September 14, 2025. “The Voice” coach and star of “Happy's Place” not only led a musical tribute for the 40th anniversary of “Golden Girls,” but also confirmed that she's engaged after five years of dating actor Rex Linn. 

The happy couple beamed as they walked the red carpet, with Linn, 68, in a black tuxedo and McEntire, 70, in a sequined black tuxedo jacket and matching long skirt. But it was the bling on the “Trailblazer” singer's left ring finger that fans really wanted to see. 

As outlets including E! News noted, McEntire sported a unique black diamond band throughout the evening — on the red carpet and during her “Golden Girls” tribute — rather than a traditional diamond ring. 

Natural, black diamonds are rare gems called carbonados, featuring a “distinct and unusual polycrystalline diamond material,” according to the International Gem Society. The organization says they are only found in Brazil and the Central African Republic, but that black diamond engagement rings have been rising in popularity in recent years.  

Although McEntire subtly confirmed her engagement at the Emmys, she did not say whether the ring she was sporting is her official engagement ring. She also didn't share details on Linn's proposal, but a source told People during the evening, “It happened a few months ago and they are very happy.”

The news of McEntire and Linn's engagement broke during their red carpet interview with Zuri Hall of E! News — though their confirmation of the news was very subtle. 

When Hall introduced the couple as “Reba McEntire and her fiancé, Rex Linn,” they both nodded and the country songstress said, “Yeah!”

Hall then noted that Linn is “co-starring on ‘Happy's Place,' I hear,” and McEntire replied, “We're having a blast on ‘Happy's Place' and so glad to be here tonight.”

McEntire and Linn first met in the 1990s, but didn't start dating until 2020 after he called to check in, having heard that her mom was ill.

“We'd gotten to see each other before because we're both on ‘Young Sheldon,'” she explained on “The Today Show” in 2021. So starting in March of 2020, we just kept talking and visiting and finally got together, see each other in June.”

In May, McEntire told Fox Digital that theirs is a “perfect union,” noting, “Rex and I get along in every aspect. He's a better cook than I am, so I like that, for sure. We love Longhorns, we love the cowboy way of life, cowgirl way of life, and we both got into the entertainment industry.”

McEntire was previously married to Charlie Battles from 1976 to 1987, and to Narvel Blackstock from 1989 to 2015, per Page Six, but Linn has never been married.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Former Costar Gives Warm Update on Will Smith Feud","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/will-smith-janet-hubert-what-happened/","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 12:26:23 GMT","

Will Smith‘s former “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” costar, Janet Hubert, just spoke out on “The Big Tigger Show” to reveal where she stands with the A-lister decades after pair famously butted heads numerous times.

As fans know, Hubert played Aunt Viv for three seasons, before her role was recast and filled by Daphne Maxwell Reid, who remained in the role until the show's conclusion in 1996.

Things went sour between Smith and Hubert after she departed from the hit series, citing a salary cut and turmoil in her personal life. But now, Hubert has revealed that things between the former costars are finally looking sunnier. Read on for details.

Hubert revealed her current relationship with Smith is “so good.” She told Bigg Tigg, “As a matter of fact, I'm gonna give my boy his props. He put together the website, with his team, for me. He gave me his entire website team, and paid for it!” Hubert was referencing the website for her project “JG and the BC Kids,” an independent animated feature film which encourages kids to get into STEM.

Hubert said Smith also let her work with his entire social media team. 

In a full circle moment, Hubert revealed the first public comments that ignited the feud were made by Smith at the very same radio station, Atlanta's V-103, where the current interview was taking place. “We are at the scene of the crime right now,” Hubert joked. She explained, “Back 35 years ago, this station was the station where he did that first interview. Yes, at V-103.” She described the incident by saying her costar “dogged me out.”

She went on, “It's very cathartic for me and very healing for me to be here.”

People says in a 2024 episode of Vice's “Black Comedy in America” series, Smith called the trouble with his costar “a horrible error.” He revealed that he undervalued the 68-year-old's “value and power and beauty to the show.” He went on, “I horribly underestimated what she was to me at that point in my life.”

The report says prior to the pair making up, Smith complained that Hubert wanted their famous sitcom to be “The Aunt Viv of Bel-Air Show.” For Hubert's part, the Independent says she once called the actor “an egomaniac” and told TMZ after the star posted a group photo with several castmates in 2011, “This constant reunion thing will never ever happen in my lifetime unless there is an apology, which he doesn't know the word.”

Reba McEntire and Rex Linn are officially engaged, as reported by People. The couple confirmed the happy news after an E! News reporter referred to them as fiancés on the 2025 Emmy Awards red carpet on Sunday, Sept. 14. McEntire, 70, and Linn, 68, first crossed paths in the 1990s but didn't begin dating until 2020, when they reconnected during quarantine. 

The couple's engagement was revealed during the star-studded Emmys red carpet, adding another milestone to their love story. 

McEntire, who has long been open about her relationship, appeared glowing as she celebrated both her career and personal joy.

McEntire previously shared that Linn reached out to her in 2020, shortly after her mother's passing. “In 2020, when Mama got sick, he called me,” she said on Today in October 2021. “We'd gotten to see each other before because we're both on ‘Young Sheldon.' So starting in March of 2020, we just kept talking and visiting and finally got together, see each other in June.”

Their bond quickly deepened during lockdown. “And we've been pretty much inseparable ever since,” McEntire said. Earlier this year, she told Fox News that they “get along in every aspect.” She added, “He's a better cook than I am, so I like that, for sure. We love Longhorns, we love the cowboy way of life, cowgirl way of life, and we both got into the entertainment industry.”

The couple not only shares life but also works side by side. They currently star in the sitcom “Happy's Place,” which Linn once described as “a dream come true.” He also emphasized their commitment to one another, saying, “We are best friends. We wanna cross the finish line with each other in a relationship.”

For McEntire and Linn, their engagement marks the latest chapter in a love story built on friendship, laughter, and a deep respect for one another.

From emotional speeches to surprise wins, the 2025 Emmys delivered a night to remember. See the complete list of winners and relive television's biggest moments here.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","VIDEO: Malcolm-Jamal Warner Honored by TV Mom at the Emmys","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/malcolm-jamal-warner-mom-emmys-cosby-show-tribute/","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 02:58:01 GMT","

Phylicia Rashad, who played Malcolm-Jamal Warner's mother on “The Cosby Show,” took the stage at the 2025 Emmy Awards on Sunday, Sept. 14, to say a few words before the In Memorium part of the show.

He was honored alongside so many who had an incredible impact, including Gene Hackman, Val Kilmer, Maggie Smith, Terence Stamp, Michelle Trachtenberg, Ozzy Osbourne, and Liam Payne.

Warner played Theodore Huxtable on “The Cosby Show, having earned an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy in 1986. Rashad portrayed his mother, Clair Huxtable.

“He was a beloved teenager in an iconic television series who the world watched grow into manhood,” Rashad said. “Like all our friends and colleagues who transitioned this past year, Malcolm-Jamal Warner remains in our hearts. Tonight, as is tradition at the Emmys, we remember them not just for their immense talent, but also for the way they made us believe in something bigger, the best that is within us. Even though they may not longer be here with us, we can all smile, knowing their impact will remain, knowing that their lasting impressions will continue to live on through story, knowing that they touched our lives. And whether you grew up watching them, or have just now discovered their brilliance, their light remains in the very fabric of our industry.”

A post shared by River and Ember (@river.and.ember)

For the first time since his tragic death, Warner's widow, Tenisha Warner, broke her silence, posting on Instagram on Friday, Sept. 12. She shared a photo of the two from their 2017 wedding.

“Thank you for holding us in so much love during this tender time,” she wrote.”Tomorrow marks our anniversary — and my heart is wide open.”

“For the first time, I'm sharing a glimpse of the love that began it all,” she continued. “I can still hear my husband's laugh, still feel the way he made room for every part of me — every tear, every dream.”

“Today, in his honor, my daughter and I are launching River & Ember and officially opening The Warner Family Foundation,” Warner detailed. “Together we carry the legacy my husband and I began— one that nurtures children's inner light and gives young artists the freedom to create outside the lines.”

“This is love,” she concluded. “Still moving. Still making. Still carrying us forward.”

Warner passed away in July at the age of 54 after drowning while on vacation in Costa Rica.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Sofia Vergara Rushes to Emergency Room & Misses the Emmy Awards","https://entertainmentnow.com/agt/sofia-vergara-misses-emmy-awards-health-scare/","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 13:58:02 GMT","

Sofia Vergara missed the 2025 Emmy Awards after an unexpected health scare. The “America's Got Talent” judge revealed on September 14 that she was rushed to the ER with a swollen eye allergy just before the ceremony.

“Didn't make it to the Emmys but made it to the ER,” the “Griselda” star, 53, wrote in a lighthearted Instagram caption alongside a carousel of photos, including a close-up of her red, swollen eye. “Sorry, I had to cancel! Craziest eye [allergy] right before getting in the car!”

A post shared by Sofia Vergara (@sofiavergara)

In addition to the close-up, Vergara shared videos from the hospital, including one of her moaning in pain while lying in bed and another rinsing her eye at a sink. The actress, who underwent her second knee surgery in July, tried to keep the moment humorous, adding emojis to her post.

The comments on her Instagram filled quickly with encouragement. “Oh no! Get well soon,” wrote “America's Got Talent” host Terry Crews, while Snoop Dogg sent a string of praying-hands emojis. Though she wasn't nominated, Vergara had been slated to present at this year's Emmys.

According to a September 9 press release, she was part of a starry list of presenters that included Elizabeth Banks, Angela Bassett, Jason Bateman, Kristen Bell, Sterling K. Brown, Jennifer Coolidge, Colman Domingo, Tina Fey, Mariska Hargitay, Jude Law, Sarah Paulson, Sydney Sweeney, Jesse Williams, and Catherine Zeta-Jones.

Vergara wasn't the only name absent. “Euphoria” star Eric Dane, who revealed his ALS diagnosis in April, was also set to present but did not attend. His “Grey's Anatomy” costar Jesse Williams took the stage alone to present the Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series award.

The 2025 Emmys, hosted by comedian Nate Bargatze, still brought out Hollywood's biggest stars. 

Stephen Colbert earned one of the evening's most memorable moments when “The Late Show,” which CBS had canceled in July, won Outstanding Talk Series. 

And history was made when Owen Cooper, 15, became the youngest male actor to win Supporting Actor in a Limited/Anthology Series for “Adolescence.”

 At the same time, Tramell Tillman became the first Black actor to win Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his role in “Severance.”

Among the winners were HBO Max's “The Pitt” for Outstanding Drama Series, Apple TV+'s “The Studio” for Outstanding Comedy Series, and “Adolescence” in the Limited/Anthology category. Notable acting wins went to Noah Wyle (“The Pitt”), Britt Lower (“Severance”), Seth Rogen (“The Studio”), Jean Smart (“Hacks”), Jeff Hiller (“Somebody Somewhere”), Hannah Einbinder (“Hacks”), and Cristin Milioti (“The Penguin”).

While the fall film festival season has slowly become known as the feeding ground of the film awards season (now stretching all the way until March), this year's mad dash through Venice, Telluride, and Toronto provided that and more. Yes, of course, awards contenders are on offer here (plus a bounty of standout performances and impeccable below the line work), but as we set about assembling our list of the best films to premiere at the fall fests, something else emerged: range.

That means not just the films you'd expect to see on our own year-end best-of lists or at the Oscars next year, but other gems too, including a horror debut, a surefire Netflix-backed crowdpleaser, a winner centered on a stork, and even a short film so good it begged to be included amongst its feature brethren.

So, we're taking stock of this new crop (and ready for NYFF, AFI FEST, and a flood of starry regional festivals in the coming weeks) the best way we know how: sharing our favorites and highlighting just what makes them so special.

The story of America is rife with such difficult realities, of course, and Laura Poitras (“Citizenfour,” “All the Beauty and the Bloodshed”), like subject Seymour Hersh, has made a career of unpacking the kind of civil violations and moral atrocities that would have been committed with impunity if not for a dedicated effort to bring the truth to light. In Hersh, whose ongoing body of work represents a chronology of American malfeasance that spans from the Vietnam War to the Gaza genocide, she and her co-director Mark Obenhaus have found the perfect opportunity to step back and see the big picture — to make one film that outlines a historic cycle of obfuscation rather than 10 films that grapple with each of these different subjects in a vacuum. 

The result is, in some respects, a rather straightforward documentary portrait of an indefatigable journalist. But in refracting more than 50 years of crime and conspiracy through the prism of Hersh's career as an investigative reporter, “Cover-Up” is also the deepest and most damning film that Poitras has ever made about truth in America — and the power to control it. —DE

Adapted from Maggie O'Farrell's 2020 novel of the same name, “Hamnet” is an emotionally pulverizing drama that imagines how the death of William Shakespeare and Anne (or Agnes) Hathaway's only son might have inspired the creation of his greatest tragedy; think of it as “Shakespeare in Agony.” And yet the violent beauty of this film, which rips your soul out of your chest so completely that its seismic grief almost feels like falling in love or becoming a parent, is that it's as much about the experience of having a child as it is about the experience of losing one. 

More to the point, “Hamnet” is a wrenching story about how those two experiences — so unalike in dignity — might ultimately be catalyzed by the same process of emotional transfiguration. In the first, your heart is placed into someone else's body. In the second, that body is subsumed into the world. To create anything, be it a person or a play, is to give a piece of yourself a life of its own; a life that you will never again be able to control or keep safe. It's to risk the infinite potential of an offering over the unborn reality of an idea, and to accept how even something that looks just like you can grow to assume unimaginable shapes. The author dies so that their work can be reborn anew forever. —DE

Eighteen minutes is all we have to save the country (or not) upon news of an impending nuclear missile in Kathryn Bigelow‘s horrifically gripping and cautionary “A House of Dynamite.” If we don't do something about the lunatics in power globally, and specifically at the helm of nine countries with a nuclear stockpile (including the United States), well then, we're fucked. Bigelow's explosively entertaining real-time thriller, told from multiple perspectives at various levels of government from situation room deputies to POTUS (Idris Elba) himself, does not mince on hopelessness.

Hardly mere agitprop due to the stylistic intensity of its filmmaking, this gun-to-your-head engrossing movie — with its eardrum-piercing and death-rattling sound design and a score by Volker Bertelmann so oppressive it could swallow you whole — also wants to shake you out of your slumber with a cataclysmic whisper of an ending. We used to duck under our desks to rehearse surviving a nuclear annihilation; now, we only duck our heads in the sand we keep shoveling over ourselves. You can't stop what's coming, and what's coming is worse than you thought. —RL

In appearing to give you nothing, Jim Jarmusch‘s almost perversely downplayed trio of short stories “Father Mother Sister Brother” winds up giving you almost everything if you can tap into its cool vibrations.

Packed into the film‘s triptych of globe-spanning episodes about estranged adult children and their late-in-life parents coming together again (at least geographically speaking, when not emotionally) is a profound appeal: If we as children don't bother to ask our parents questions, meet them halfway, why should they bother with us? If you felt not loved by your parents enough as a child or rejected by them as an adult, maybe that's because they felt you didn't need them anymore, and so resumed living their own lives. What if familial damage is too late to repair? Jarmusch would argue it's not, though with his hushedly sad new movie, he's not about to coax his characters along the psychoanalytic dotted line from childhood resentment to coughed-up, adult-age catharsis. —RL

Words like “bold” and “daring” and “wild” will be thrown around — really, have already been thrown around — in regards to Nia DaCosta's “Hedda,” one of the more original and thrilling adaptations of a classic work in recent memory. The same words apply to the title character at the film‘s center, the inscrutable and seemingly unscrupulous Hedda Gabler (a magnetic Tessa Thompson), here yanked firmly from the late 20th century setting of Henrik Ibsen's iconic play into the '50s, and not missing a single trick along the way.

 










The time setting is hardly the only thing DaCosta, who also wrote the film's screenplay has changed here, which now imagines Hedda to be a Black woman (one supporting character marvels at her “dusky” skin) whose love affairs involve both men and women. The former flame who shows up at her sprawling (read: unaffordable) country home for a raucous (read: deadly) party is, in DaCosta's telling, now a woman: Eileen Lovborg, no longer Eilert Lovborg. Again, bold and daring and wild changes, sure, but also imaginative and illuminating. Which is to say: this all works, very well. —KE

Arthur Schnitzler's novella “Late Fame” chronicles the renewed attention an erstwhile poet receives from a circle of young aspiring artists. One wintry eve, Eduard Saxberger comes home to his apartment to find an eager Wolfgang Meier itching to praise his name. Meier informs Saxberger that he read his slim collection of poetry, written and forgotten 30 years prior, and shared it with his “Enthusiasm Society” of ambitious writers. Meier encourages Saxberger to join the group, who are in the midst of organizing a reading that will debut their talents to Vienna. Flattered and reinvigorated by their admiration, Saxberger hangs around the young crowd and lets himself believe that he finally might be on the brink of recognition.

 










Director Kent Jones and “May December” screenwriter Samy Burch update and contemporize Schnitzler's novella for the big screen while otherwise remaining doggedly faithful to its emotional and thematic anxieties. Much like Stanley Kubrick and Frederic Raphael did with Schnitzler's “Dream Story” for “Eyes Wide Shut,” they shift the Austrian-set story to modern-day New York, but exchange that film's psychological menace with a wistful melancholy. —VM

There are any number of movies about people who try to reinvent themselves in the face of a crisis. There are many fewer movies about people who violently refuse to even consider that idea — people who would rather kill someone else than become someone else. Park Chan-wook's bleak, brilliant, and mordantly hilarious “No Other Choice” is the exception that proves the rule. 

Plotted with ornate precision but unfolding with the panic of a desperate man, this Vantablack comedy tells the story of a mustached paper manufacturing specialist (“Squid Game” villain Lee Byung-hun as Man-su) who achieves the suburban idyll just in time to be let go from the company where he's worked for the last 25 years. Some American investors have bought a piece of the business, and with it the right to restructure things as they see fit. 

 










Immaculately spacious for a story this unsubtle, Park's film toys with the idea that capitalism is an engine for moral impunity — that it's a universally accepted excuse for the kind of thoughtless cruelties that would seem beyond reproach in any other context. And even though we understand the general outline of Man-su's plan from the start, it's so riveting to watch it play out (and go wrong) because “No Other Choice” sees his murder spree as a natural extension of capitalism, rather than a bizarre aberration from it. Demented, yes. Insane, not so much. —DE

It's hard to stop thinking about Lucrecia Martel‘s gutting true-crime documentary “Nuestra Tierra (Landmarks),” long in the works and about the 2009 murder of an Argentine Indigenous leader, after you've seen it. And to call it true crime at all feels like a pitiful, prescriptive, catch-all response to the ambitions of the movie, her first feature-length documentary after fiction films like “The Headless Woman,” “La Cienaga,” and “Zama” (which almost took her down) pulled back the veil on her relationship to her country's fraught colonial history. But if a documentary that mixes cell-phone footage that feels ripped out of a found-footage horror movie with procedural courtroom red tape and testimony isn't true true crime, I don't know what is.

 










“Nuestra Tierra,” which began around the time the 2018 court hearings began for the murder of Javier Chocobar by three mining entrepreneurs who stepped on his community's land with firearms and a false sense of ownership, also makes the case that drone footage, which feels so overdone on Netflix crime documentaries and threatens to erase the feeling of an actual human being at the storytelling's wheel, actually works. Martel jettisons multiple drones into the sky overlooking the Chuschagasta native landscape in northern Argentina, acquiring the effect first of zoomed-in satellite footage, then of something more voyeuristic and frightening, adopting the viewpoint of colonialism itself. —RL

We're rapidly approaching the point where the most reliable route to becoming a horror director is to launch a short-form comedy career. Jordan Peele shocked the world with “Get Out,” Zach Cregger made it a pattern with “Barbarian” and “Weapons,” Danny and Michael Philippou jumped on the train with “Talk to Me” and “Bring Her Back.” Now, YouTube prankster Curry Barker has released one of the best horror films of 2025.

“Obsession” begins with the simplest of horror premises: Bear (Michael Johnston) is a shy and sensitive music store employee who can't find the courage to ask his co-worker and childhood friend Nikki (Inde Navarrette) on a date. Rather than be honest with her and tell her how he actually feels, he wanders into a woo-woo crystal store and buys a One Wish Willow, a kitschy antique toy from the 1960s that promises to grant its owner one wish when they snap a branch in half. The cashier warns him that most of the customers who buy them have complained about the results, but it wouldn't be much of a horror movie if he listened.

 










“Obsession” is proof that the Cregger-ification of 2020s horror is in full effect, as its combination of sadistic violence, ironic needle drops, and comedy mined from people responding to tragedy in pathetically self-serving ways will merit plenty of comparisons to “Barbarian” and “Weapons.” It also wisely continues the recent trend of allowing forces of unexplained evil to simply exist in its world, finding its social commentary in the way humans react to things they don't understand. Instead of turning the actual evils into metaphors. —CZ

Headlining action-movie idol and wrestler Dwayne Johnson drops “The Rock” from his identity in all senses to reveal a heartfelt core in Benny Safdie's nimbly executed and oddly endearing “The Smashing Machine.” Johnson, rarely considered a quote-unquote serious actor but most certainly a bona fide movie star thanks to the “Fast and the Furious” films and an abundance of popcorn outings often dismissed by critics, emotionally strips down to play pioneering MMA fighter Mark Kerr in the hole of painkiller addiction while trying to mount a post-rehab comeback.

Safdie's first solo-directed feature after helming episodes of TV's “The Curse” and creatively breaking up with his brother Josh sounds like the stuff of awards-season bait: An actor going out of his range to play a tortured athletic soul, physically transformed in a steroidal, vein-bulged-muscles sense, on the rocky path to redemption.

 










But “The Smashing Machine” is not that, nor is it “The Wrestler,” either (but that a Bruce Springsteen song also plays in this film at a moment of Mark's rock bottom will put you in the headspace of Darren Aronofsky's melodrama). Safdie's film is rather a sweet duet between a remarkably unembellished Johnson and a blazingly good, blue-collar and freshly blown-out Emily Blunt as his codependent girlfriend and eventual wife Dawn Staples-Kerr. —RL

An excellent documentary that also happens to be an achingly beautiful bit of poetry, “Honeyland” director Tamara Kotevska's “The Tale of Silyan” pairs a Macedonian fable with a stirring look at the economic disruptions of the 21st century. Government policy in North Macedonia has allowed for the price of the crops that the film's subject Nikola and his family farm from soil they've tilled for generations to go ever lower — to the point that farming is not a sustainable industry any longer. Kotevska turns her camera on agonizing scenes of Nikola and his family all but abandoning their potatoes, along with watermelon and other crops, and leaving them to rot because selling them makes no sense. Suddenly, an entire livelihood, and with it a way of life, has ended. And Nikola's family has to abandon him to seek better opportunities in Germany.  It all echoes with a centuries' old Macedonian fable about an old man, whose family abandoned him, finding solace in his loneliness by bonding with a stork — and indeed Nikola becomes friends with a stork, the kind that have taken to prowling the landfills across the country that used to be farms. Billed as a docu-fable, “The Tale of Silyan” blends non-fiction with the elements of a fairy tale in an extremely sophisticated way for a filmmaker still in her early thirties. This is a filmmaker capable of glimpsing both an instant — and the eternal. —CB

Hot on the heels of “The Brutalist,” Mona Fastvold and Brady Corbet have returned with another sweeping historical epic about a European iconoclast who comes to America in order to build a new kind of church. Even more excitingly, “The Testament of Ann Lee” — a speculative, feverish, and altogether rapturous biopic about the Mancunian preacher who founded the Shakers and believed herself to be the female incarnation of Christ on Earth — addresses the most glaring problem with last year's story about the fictional architect László Tóth: It wasn't a musical. 

In a sense, “The Testament of Ann Lee” is a celebration of — and then in its less rhapsodic second half, a plea for — the conditions required to make a movie like “The Testament of Ann Lee.” Here is another mad pursuit with shallow pockets and grand ambitions (which looks like a mega-budgeted studio project, thanks to production designer Sam Bader). It's another utopian prayer led by a woman in a business dominated by men, a woman who, in Fastvold's case, had to harness the energies of a crew much larger than Ann Lee's initial congregation in order to fulfill her vision. 

Like “The Brutalist” before it (to say nothing of Fastvold's heart-wrenchingly great “The World to Come” before that), the film doubles as a workable alternative for how films might be made. Just as Ann Lee's upbeat message appealed to a Christian population that had grown tired of being promised salvation through suffering, Fastvold and Corbet's model offers a more actionable response to an industry sick of Hollywood doomsayers. —DE

It would be sufficiently devastating if the atrocities in “The Voice of Hind Rajab” only existed in hyper-recent living memory, but no, the Israeli violence toward Palestinians has escalated since the date of its setting: January 29, 2024. Watching this film feels like RSVPing for a funeral of someone who is still alive. It is also an elegy for a child whose life force is heartrending, because we know it doesn't stand a chance.

The story of six-year-old Hind Rajab made headlines in January 2024 after the Palestine Red Crescent released audio of her distressed emergency call, made from a service station in Tel al-Hawa in southern Gaza. Even establishment news channels, generally averse to displaying the humanity of individual Palestinians, could not resist this cri de coeur of an innocent in peril. Her sweet, trembling voice, saying, “I'm scared, come and get me,” traveled around the world. She was begging to be rescued from a car full of the fresh corpses, as night and the IDF closed in on her.

For her latest film, Tunisian director Kaouther Ben Hania has sourced the entire call and treated it with respect, horror, and grief, affording it space to play out in in full without attempts to visualize, animate, or reconstruct what is happening on the ground for Hind. Instead, whenever we hear Hind's voice, sound waves fill the screen and in the corner: 240129.WAV. On every level, this is the right choice. The words are enough. The fear in her little voice as she explains her situation in bursts tells us everything. Any extra trimmings would land somewhere between glib and sacrilegious. —SMK

Even before Rian Johnson‘s much-anticipated third Knives Out mystery world premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival (as all of Johnson's wily whodunits have), word was already out that this was a bit darker. After all, it's right there in the title, “Wake Up Dead Man,” which doesn't fuss about with the fact that as fun as these capers are, they're still about murders. And Johnson himself didn't shy away from that early buzz, telling the crowd assembled at the Princess of Wales Theater on Saturday night that, if “Knives Out” was a more cozy mystery and “Glass Onion” was a bigger, sunnier deconstruction of the genre, “Wake Up Dead Man” was his dip into more Edgar Allan Poe-tinged waters.

It works, and it's no big mystery why — Johnson knows his form and format, and delivers on it, playing with tone and message but never losing sight of why these stories are so damn entertaining to watch and unravel.

As ever, master detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is joined by a murderer's row (oh, are they now? let's see) of big-name talents, though Josh O'Connor as young priest Jud Duplenticy steals the show as a terrified murder suspect who comes to partner with Benoit. Johnson has always been aces at casting, but he's here given rising star O'Connor a special role: both dark and funny, desperate and in control. When the film really flips its tone about halfway through, O'Connor ably carries that twist. (And, no, we doubt any other young working actor could so winkingly deliver a line about being “young, dumb, and full of Christ” quite like the multi-faceted O'Connor.) —KE
 










Plus, a special bonus short film pick:

Short films don't often find their way onto IndieWire's best-of lists, but if there's one director making them who should be on your radar in 2025, it's Blake Winston Rice. After charming Cannes audiences with his Michael Gandolfini-led short “Tea,” he returned to the festival circuit this fall with “DISC,” a hilarious two-hander starring Jim Cummings and Victoria Ratermanis (who also co-wrote the script with Rice). It's everything that a short film should be: elegantly simple, milking a unique premise with a charismatic cast for all that it's worth and then exiting early enough to leave us wanting more. 

Cummings and Ratermanis are illicit lovers who hook up in a seedy motel at a work convention, only to end up getting to know each other in a matter that's far more intimate than sex when her “tampon alternative” becomes stuck inside her and he is asked to find a way to get it out. Cummings — who spends the vast majority of the film clad in tighty whities — gives one of his best non-directorial acting performances in a film that sees him brilliantly straddle the line between moral obligation and the deeply human desire to get the hell out of an unpleasant situation. Watching him frantically explain to a hotel maid that he's deep in a “male-female situation” and will be unable to let her clean the room is one of the great pleasures of the 2025 festival season, and Rice's wry sense of visual humor shines through in every shot. Someone give this man the money to make a feature ASAP. —CZ

Nate Bargatze, the immensely popular stand-up comedian who admitted near the top of Sunday night's Emmys telecast that he's less well-established in Hollywood proper, was always going to have his work cut out for him as the host of television's most prestigious awards show. By hiring the Nashville, TN native known for self-deprecating humor and charming nonchalance, CBS and producers Jesse Collins, Dionne Harmon, and Jeannae Rouzan-Clay were taking aim at an audience outside the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles. Bargatze's everyman appeal lies not with the famous actors and directors gathered to celebrate their best work, but with onlookers who otherwise may not think to watch the Emmys on a night where they could catch an NFL game, an MLB game, or the theme park ride-turned feature film “Jungle Cruise” (on ABC!).

So when his latest and most formal gig began with a sketch — harkening back to his most renowned small-screen success to date: the “Washington's Dream” sketch on “SNL” — there was reason to believe he'd be able to walk the fine line between sincerely honoring artistic accomplishments and poking fun at those being honored (and, presumably, himself). It's the host's eternal struggle, after all: combining the ceremony's three main genres — comedy, drama, and limited series — into one fun, moving, and snappy show.

Well, “snappy” is a nice way of putting what followed.

While many bad bits are often used to reference infamous awards shows (“Remember when Seth MacFarlane sang ‘I Saw Your Boobs' at the Oscars?”), it's rare for a single bit to be so disastrous it tarnishes the entire three-hour production as it's happening. Then again, it's also rare for a host to go on live television and hold charity money hostage — his only demand being that those lucky enough to win keep their speeches so short they're either rushed, forgettable, or bleeped into oblivion. 

The rules were simple enough: Winners would be limited to 45 seconds for each speech and penalized $1,000 for every second they go over. If they finished early, Bargatze would donate an extra $1,000 for every second they were under, but the latter situation clearly wasn't going to outpace the former, and even if it did, the best-case scenario would have been that the show finished early, the speeches were all whittled down to nothing, and the 2025 Emmys telecast was remembered for… ruthless efficiency? 

Many viewers took issue with the idea right away, before the donation ticker appeared next to Emmy recipients as they were still speaking, or was cited as a reason for wrapping up before they could remember what they wanted to say, or when it was clear Bargatze wrote 90 percent of his jokes pegged to how much money he was or wasn't donating to the Boys and Girls Club of America. (And why did those jokes all follow the same structure? It felt like Bargatze said some version of, “That last speech cost me money/saved me money” roughly 19 times.)

 










Aren't the speeches why people watch the Emmys? Aren't the honorees supposed to be thinking about their colleagues, families, and friends, and not how many tens of thousands of dollars thanking them will cost children in need? Shouldn't they feel proud of their accomplishment by the end, and not ashamed of how many seconds they took up acknowledging it? 

And from the audience's point of view, do we want to be screaming at our favorite TV stars to hurry up and get off the stage? Do we want to feel guilty for savoring those fragile moments when they take a second to fight back the tears and find just the right words? Would everyone prefer if they just sent out the list of winners as an email? That's the most efficient way to do it!

The Emmys, for two years in a row and too many years overall, have felt driven more by embarrassment for existing than pride for the mission at hand. Why so many producers feel the need to cater awards shows to people who don't like awards, I'll never understand, but the 77th Emmy Awards did little to counter that imbalance, no matter what the final balance of Bargatze's charity offering turned out to be. (CBS ended up donating $100,000 to Bargatze's $250,000 for a total of $350,000, after the tracker plunged well into the red following the final few speeches.)

 










Still, there were highs on the night, and none were higher than when Stephen Colbert sprinted to the stage after winning Best Talk Show for the soon-to-be-canceled “The Late Show.” 

“Sometimes you only truly know how much you love something when you get a sense that you might be losing it,” he said. “Ten years [after starting the show], in September of 2025, my friends, I have never loved my country more desperately. God bless America. Stay strong, be brave, and if the elevator tries to bring you down, go crazy and punch a higher floor.”

That sentence may have cost the Boys and Girls Club a few thousand dollars, but in the moment, no one cared — which is how it's supposed to feel. We're all supposed to get caught up in the moment. We're all supposed to share in the excitement. We're all not supposed to be hoping for a polite nod, a curt word, and then onto the next terse speaker. Colbert's glee gave his well-written speech an extra oomph, and the crowd was eager to hear anything and everything he had to say. One could even argue they were starved for a heartfelt and inspiring address on a night designed to keep them at bay. (Thank goodness for Hannah Einbinder, as well, whose years-in-the-making speech made a salient political point and came straight from the heart — in just six short words.)

 










Cristin Milioti's exuberant win for “The Penguin” stood out in similarly unconstrained fashion, when the long-toiling actress earned her first Emmy (for her first nomination) and let loose on stage. Grinning ear to ear yet clearly overwhelmed by the moment, Milioti notably only broke from her earnest thanks and overt enthusiasm when she noticed her time was about to run out. (“Are you kidding?” she said. “Wow, this really speeds.”) But that didn't stop her from shouting, “I love you, and I love acting so much!” before letting out an actual scream to end it. 

Would the show have been notably better without those nods to love, art, and humanity itself? I think not! Nor would the night be better served if Tramell Tillman, the first Black man to win Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, or Jeff Hiller — adorned in sparkling pink suit — had faded quietly into the background. “The last 25 years I've been like, ‘World, I want to be an actor,' and the world is like, ‘Maybe computers?'” Hiller said, accepting Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his role in “Somebody Somewhere.” Thank goodness the Emmy statue, if not the Emmy telecast, spoke up on behalf of a world eager for more of his acting.

Beyond the misjudged charity gambit, the 2025 Emmys also suffered from a general lack of enthusiasm for its honorees — and fans of awards shows in general. There were no clips for the nominees and shockingly few examples of their work shown during the broadcast. The reunions (if you can call them that) did little to stoke nostalgia for shows like “Gilmore Girls” and “Law & Order.” The celebrities in attendance (when they weren't being hurried off-stage) weren't well-utilized either. JB Smoove talking to Ben Stiller should be good for at least one laugh, but it was like Stiller had no idea what was happening! Were there no rehearsals this year? 

 










Even Bargatze's opening sketch felt casually slapped together. As Philo T. Farnsworth, the inventor of television, Bargatze joked that people don't actually understand “Severance,” no one knows what a producer does, and only women watch true-crime TV. His few sharper jokes — “What is streaming, sir?” “A new way for people to lose money” — teased better quips to come (like when he alluded to the Paramount-Warner Bros. merger while introducing “Gilmore Girls”), but Bargatze didn't even give himself enough time to get there. He didn't do a monologue, and instead moved from the sketch to the first category before returning to introduce the doomed charity speech timer. 

“If you want to say more, do it on social media later,” he said. “More people will see it there anyway.”

That may be true, but you still have to put on a show for the people in the auditorium, and the speeches are the show. Don't be so embarrassed to admit it. 

The 77th Primetime Emmy Awards were held Sunday, September 14 at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles, CA. The telecast aired on CBS and is available to stream on Paramount+.

As many had predicted, the 77th Primetime Emmys were dominated on the comedy side by “The Studio.” Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's film industry satire has been the talk of Hollywood since it premiered, so few were shocked to see it win 13 Emmys across the Primetime and Creative Arts ceremonies, including Best Comedy Series and Leading Actor in a Comedy Series for Rogen. The Apple TV+ show ended up breaking the record for most Emmy wins for a comedy series in one year — and that's on top of the record that it already set with its 23 nominations.

 










But there was one “The Studio“-related Emmy prediction that didn't come true: Sal Saperstein was never mentioned during the show. A memorable episode of “The Studio” Season 1 saw the fictional Continental Pictures executive (played by Ike Barinholtz) go viral after seemingly being thanked by every celebrity at the Golden Globes, much to the chagrin of Rogen's Matt Remick. The joke made its way into the real world at last weekend's Creative Arts Emmys, when many of the show's winners in below-the-line categories referenced the fictional character in their own speeches. Once a “Studio” sweep began to feel inevitable on Emmy night, many expected Rogen and his pals to continue the trend. But that never happened.

When the cast and creative team visited the winners' room after the Emmys broadcast concluded on Sunday night, the lack of Sal Saperstein references was one of the first questions Rogen encountered. And the comedian gave a straightforward answer that definitely put the bit to bed (at least, until next year's Emmys).

“It's our own joke. It feels weird to reference your own joke in my opinion,” Rogen said. “We were hoping Jack Thorne would do it.” 

Given the show's knack for recreating real award shows, Rogen was also asked if his night at the Emmy's had given him any ideas for a future episode. The multi-hyphenate explained that, as tempting as the idea might sound, the Continental team would never get to enjoy such a seamless night of success.

“This was far too good a thing to happen on our show, unfortunately,” he said. “Our show is generally based on stress and disappointment, but right now we're all happy.”

Even on television's biggest night, the small screen can only show so much. While the vast majority of TV fans who tune in to watch the Emmys inevitably do it by way of the telecast, a few lucky folks are in the room (and the backstage press space!) where it happens, including our own publisher James Israel, awards editor Marcus Jones, and senior editor Christian Zilko.

So, what's it like on the inside of the Emmys? Funny, well-produced, and all about honoring the art and craft of TV. (Of course.) Here's what we spied backstage, in the room, and all around Sunday night's ceremony.

 










Check out the full list of winners right here, along with our coverage of last weekend's Creative Arts Emmys.

Host Nate Bargatze reunited with some of his “Saturday Night Live” pals — Bowen Yang, Mikey Day, and James Austin Johnson — for a live opening sketch. While it wasn't quite as snappy and tight as the two-time “SNL” host's beloved “Washington's Dream” sketches, it went over very well in the room. Smartly built around the (very fake) creation of the TV, the sketch poked fun at everything from the price of streamers to the category designation of “The Bear.” Ah, we love history!

 










Emmy attendees might not get treated to all the (many, many) commercials that play during the telecast (including plenty of new looks at upcoming TV series, naturally), but that doesn't mean it's all dead air in the room during those breaks. When commercials were playing at home, the crowd at the Peacock Theater was treated to clips of classic Emmys moments of yore (like Meryl Streep's big win for “Angels in America,” Merritt Wever's “I gotta go, bye” speech, Barbra Streisand's very first Emmy win, and more) and TV themes (like “Good Times,” “Seinfeld,” “Full House,” “Family Matters,” “Charlie's Angels,” “The O.C.,” “Only Murders in the Building,” “Gilligan's Island,” and more).

For her first win, the “Hacks” star kicked off her acceptance speech by joking about convincing herself it was more “punk rock” to not win. But a win? Pretty good, too! And Einbinder ended her speech with a three-part callout that spoke to that spirit, complete with a timely congrats to her Philadelphia Eagles, who had just won their Sunday afternoon game before the ceremony kicked off: “Go Birds, Fuck ICE, Free Palestine!” (Only the second sentiment was bleeped on the telecast.)

 










Host Bargtaze introduced an intriguing concept at the top of the show: He would donate $100,000 to the Boys & Girls Club. There was just one condition: Each winner must stay within their allocated 45 seconds for their “thank you speech.” For every second they went over? Bargatze (and a running tally!) would take away $1,000. (If someone went under their 45 seconds, any amount under would be given back to the fund.)

Soon enough, however, the fund got a new dimension. During Einbinder's speech (the one with the bleep!), the actress noted that she'd be willing to pay any funds necessary to cover her overage time. After she departed the stage, Bargatze noted, “I will find her later. She also cursed, and, let me tell ya, I'll start a swear jar real fast.”

That swear jar might have proven more popular as the night went on (at some point during Stephen Graham and Jack Thorne's acceptance speech for Outstanding Writing for a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie for their “Adolescence,” at least one person in the ballroom booed the appearance of the on-screen tally). When John Oliver won Outstanding Scripted Variety Series for his “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver,” he zipped through his speech, only to cheekily add both a “Fuck you, Nate Bargatze!” and “That's some money in the swear jar for you!”

 










As the tally ticked frighteningly downward over the course of the night, Seth Rogen joked during his acceptance speech for “The Studio” and its big Outstanding Comedy Series win, “We're already in debt. We fucked over the Boys & Girls!” (No worries: Bargatze eventually bumped the total donation up to $350,000.)

When Hannah Einbinder won the Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, the “Hacks” star ended her speech with a nod to the Philadelphia Eagles and a political rallying cry: “I just want to say Go Birds, fuck ICE, and free Palestine.” 

Appearing in the winners room alongside her “Hacks” co-star Jean Smart (who picked up a fourth win for Lead Actress in a Comedy Series tonight), Einbinder elaborated on her comments. 

“I thought it was important to talk about Palestine,” Einbinder said when asked about her support for Palestine and her opposition to Israel's ongoing response to the October 7th attacks. “It's an issue that's very dear to my heart. I have friends in Gaza who are working as frontline workers, as doctors now in the north of Gaza to provide care for pregnant women and to create schools in refugee camps.”

Einbinder was one of over 4,000 actors and filmmakers who signed a petition organized by Film Workers for Palestine calling on Hollywood to boycott Israeli film companies that they believe are “complicit in genocide.” (The petition does not explicitly call for the boycott of all Israeli companies, but lists “whitewashing or justifying genocide and apartheid and/or partnering with the government committing them” as boycott-worthy behavior.) When asked about the pledge, Einbinder explained that she does not see support for Israel as a necessary condition of her Jewish faith and sees a potential Hollywood boycott as an effective means of protesting the war in Gaza.

“I feel like it is my obligation, as a Jewish person, to distinguish Jews from the state of Israel. Because our religion and our culture is such an important and longstanding… basically an institution that is separate from this ethno-nationalist state,” she said. “And in terms of the pledge, it's like many movements. Boycotting is an effective tool to create pressure on the powers that be to meet the moment. So the Film Workers for Palestine boycott does not boycott individuals. It only boycotts institutions that are directly complicit in the genocide. So yeah, it's important to me and I think it's an important measure. And so I was happy to be a part of it.”

It wasn't the only time that Einbinder made news on Emmy night, as she also seemingly revealed on the red carpet that the hit HBO Max show will be ending with the upcoming Season 5.

With 13 total nominations for its heart-stopping four episodes, Netflix's smash hit limited series “Adolescence” seemed destined to clean up at this year's Emmys ceremony. One big question entering Sunday, though, would that love be spread above and below the line?

Star and co-creator Stephen Graham might have wondered about the same thing, but with two Emmys, including both his first Emmy win for acting and writing in the bag, he's got plenty to celebrate. 

On Sunday evening, Graham first picked up the Emmy Outstanding Writing for a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie (shared with Jack Thorne) and then added to his total tally with his win for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie, beating out other major names like Colin Farrell (“The Penguin”), Jake Gyllenhaal (“Presumed Innocent”), Cooper Coch (“Monster”), and Brian Tyree Henry (“Dope Thief”).

 








Related Stories ‘Task': Inside the Creation of a Working-Class ‘Heat' on HBO The 77th Emmy Awards Ran Out the Clock 

Upon hitting the stage for the second time this evening, Graham expressed his surprise, noting that this isn't the sort of thing “doesn't normally happen to a kid like me, I'm just a mixed race kid from a block of flats in a place called Kirkby. So, for me, to be here today in front of my peers and to be acknowledged by you is the most humbling thing I can imagine in my life. Any dream is possible.”

 










Graham is also nominated as part of the overall “Adolescence” team for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series. In the series, he plays the seemingly average suburban dad Eddie Miller, who is shocked to learn his son (fellow Emmy winner Owen Cooper) has been accused of a horrific crime.

During a May appearance on IndieWire's Filmmaker Toolkit podcast, Graham opened up about the ethos he and co-creator Jack Thorne brought to set. “We've all earned the right to have the opportunity and to be there. And you must treat people as you would expect to be treated yourself. So that was one of our key components: To make sure that there [were] no dicks on set, you know what I mean,” Graham said. “Then it was putting a team together that we wanted to spend time with, but also we knew were massively creative.”  

Next up for Graham: a lot. He stars in Scott Cooper's “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere” as Bruce Springsteen's dad, Dutch, and he recently appeared in the TIFF premiere “Good Boy.” He's also in production on a number of projects, including “The Immortal Man,” “Lazarus,” and “Animol,” and he's rumored to have a role in the upcoming Tom Hanks-starring sequel to “Greyhound.”

The 76th Annual Emmy Awards honor series that aired between June 1, 2024 and May 31, 2025. The 77th annual Primetime Emmy Awards are airing live right now, Sunday, September 14, on CBS, with host Nate Bargatze. Check out all our predictions for the night's big wins right here.

In 2015, Ohio duo Twenty One Pilots broke through with a mix of nasally rap, faux reggae, and sentimental alt-rock that left audiences exclaiming: Who are these watered-down Linkin Park/311 hybrids, and where are their pants? Vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Tyler Joseph and drummer Josh Dun positioned themselves as defiantly uncool music for “the few, the proud, and the emotional.” Their high-concept nonsense and faith-influenced introspection were tailor-made for dorky high schoolers searching for their place in the world. The angsty, sheltered attitude of lines like “I wasn't raised in the hood, but I know a thing or two about pain and darkness,” off “Lane Boy,” made the band an easy punching bag, but the sincere attempt at reckoning with mental illness garnered a fanbase nicknamed “the Skeleton Clique,” years before therapyspeak became common pop parlance. Charitably, Pilots could be a gateway to more sophisticated rap and alternative selections; less charitably, they made music for the easily impressed.

But when the Chainsmokers get in their feelings or Sleep Token's album goes to No. 1, it's Joseph and Dun's footprints in the sand. They were also a formative favorite of Billie Eilish, and Turnstile tapped Pilots engineer Adam Hawkins to work on their records. Starting with 2018's Trench, Joseph shifted to a more detailed, atmospheric sound with Paul Meany of 2000s rock band Mutemath. He even matured as a lyricist, culminating in songs like last year's single “Next Semester,” which methodically trickled out details of a suicide attempt: “I remember/I remember certain things/What I was wearing/The yellow dashes in the street.”

That brings us to Breach, the eighth Pilots album and the final chapter in a complicated narrative plot encompassing nearly their entire career. To summarize: Main character Clancy tries to escape the city of Dema, but the evil Bishops always drag him back. Clancy joins the Banditos, basically a stand-in for the Skeleton Clique, and they work together to resist the Bishops. The idea is that healing is not linear; the rest is dystopian-YA window dressing. On Breach, Clancy faces off for the last time against Bishops leader Blurryface—yes, the one who, if you were near a radio a decade ago, cared what you think. Joseph and Dun send off Clancy with a chaotic, maximalist record that no one else could make, mostly because no one else would consider it.

This is Twenty One Pilots in its purest form. Opener “City Walls” is a five-minute litmus test, with gigantic “oh-woah” hooks, soaring choruses, fuzzy bass tones, overdriven drums, and yes, rapping. It's also pure fan service; the deeply ludicrous $1 million music video frequently calls back to past work and the song itself interpolates their single “Holding on to You.” It's fascinating to hear a Christian-adjacent band reprise the words “entertain my faith” as the video depicts Clancy's submission to a religious cult, but this isn't the band to handle those implications.

Having once contributed to the Suicide Squad soundtrack, Pilots now convey the bubbly energy of James Gunn's Superman reboot. You don't need to know about the Bishops' necromancing powers to enjoy the frenetic snowboarding-game breakbeat and maniacal vocal processing of “The Contract.” There are dumb-clever antics throughout: “Garbage” teases an uplifting “Something Just Like This” piano part before Joseph blurts out “I feel like garbage!” The song “Rawfear” speeds up on the line “never slowing down,” then abruptly returns to the original tempo—because he can't escape the cycle. There's hardly a breather until “Cottonwood,” a loving tribute to Joseph's grandfather, and the meditative closer, “Intentions.” There's also “Downstairs,” a dolled-up demo from their pre-major label days, but the vestigial self-seriousness feels out of place on an album like this.

The most engaging motif in the Pilots catalog remains Joseph's complex relationship with his fans. On Vessel standout (give or take a reggae break) “Guns for Hands,” he felt responsible for their mental health as his own deteriorated. On Trench ballad “Neon Gravestones,” he cautioned them not to glorify his death should he one day lose his battle with depression. The tension comes to a head on Breach. Earlier this year, somebody briefly stole a kick drum from Dun's kit at a concert, and throughout “Center Mass,” the band samples another fan's cautionary “I really don't think you should take that!” On “Drum Show,” seemingly in response to this fiasco, Joseph pays tribute to his burnt-out bandmate, who's “stuck between a rock and a home, two places he does not wanna go.” When Joseph says, “This has not been interesting in a while” on “One Way,” a fundamentally earnest band fully admits to disillusionment.

Twenty One Pilots' pure pop songs—like Scaled and Icy's “Shy Away”—are often their best, which makes their ongoing attempts at hip-hop all the more frustrating. Joseph once gave Zane Lowe a playlist of his greatest influences, and not only was Ben Gibbard on it twice, the only rapper was Matisyahu. On Breach, they sound like they maybe gave GNX a passing listen (the call-and-response on “Center Mass” is very “Reincarnated”), but their engagement with the genre remains shallow. No one has ever sounded less convincing than Tyler “gangstas don't cry, therefore I'm Mr. Misty Eyed” Joseph singing about “empty Uzis” on “Rawfear.” But when they get the balance right, they wind up with some of their best material to date: “Mass” starts with a suitably moody verse over a two-chord vamp and ends with a genuinely exciting double-time outro.

Right now it's hard to imagine a cultural re-evaluation for Twenty One Pilots, the way people who grew up in the '00s eventually gave My Chemical Romance and Linkin Park (both obvious influences) their flowers. But seeing the likes of MGK attempt a similar style without the same ambition puts the duo's merit into perspective, and at least Pilots are thoroughly committed to their uncool niche. They'd be more respected if they did away with the rapping entirely, but that would fundamentally change what this band is and why it got this far. As for poor Clancy, he fails to break the cycle and, in a Matrix Reloaded-esque twist, the rebels must find another “Clancy” to continue the fight. It's a surprisingly sobering ending: No one here truly transcends their limitations, but it's only a matter of time before they try again.

It's all blurring together. Ambient is emo now. Rap sounds like harsh noise. Drum'n'bass is basically bedroom pop. And Ben Bondy, who until now has primarily dealt in disorientingly dubby ambient music, has emerged with something resembling a singer/songwriter album, but not quite. Bondy, a New York/Berlin-based producer who's made a name as part of the latter's cozy Kwia collective, has built a sprawling body of work across a number of labels representing the bleary haze of the left-field electronic underground. West Mineral Ltd., 3XL, Motion Ward, Quiet Time—if they deal in grainy, dissociative soundscapes, Bondy has probably released something for them. Across his scattered releases and DJ sets, Bondy's demonstrated a voracious, shapeshifting sense of taste, though he's never put it on display quite as openly as he does on XO Salt Llif3. As its Uzi-quoting name implies, his latest is a referential grab bag of sounds clubby or otherwise, albeit reconfigured here into a confessional diary of gauzy, acoustic laptop pop.

This isn't the first time Bondy has strolled on the indie or cloud rap side of the tracks, but nothing he's released previously could prepare you for opening track “Bend,” with its tropical blend of amapiano log drumming, Alex G guitars, and Auto-Tuned sighs. Picking up the thread on the dembow-powered minimalist R&B of Organ Tapes and Palmistry, Bondy brings a lushness that stands apart from those artists' MIDI-controller-and-a-mic ethos. The front half of XO Salt Llif3 shows off the producer's touch: The Drainer shoegaze of “Dreamseed” picks up more and more distortion as it lurches along, while “Ur Ghost Is My Shadow” grows from a dejected Blunt-ian folk strummer into a trip-hop depression spiral, Bondy's low growl balancing coarsely against Berlin singer Kissen's soft vocals. Bondy treats his pop inspirations as just another piece of material to repurpose, a natural extension of his experimental collages.

XO Salt Llif3's best moments are constantly shapeshifting, refusing to leave songs exactly where they started. The album fulfills that promise less as it goes on; the record's back half largely settles into a mold of shimmering hypebeast emo, leaning a bit too heavily on Bondy's underdeveloped songwriting to carry it over the finish line. “There Is a Place” and “Flood” slow their strums to the point of melodrama, while “Stunned Suddenly” drifts between passages of fingerpicked guitars and glitchy beats over its six and a half minutes, ultimately dragged down by Bondy's endlessly repeated mantra, “You're beautiful/You're amazing/You're driving me crazy.” “Bend” has a similarly featherlight hook (“Cause I love ya, ayy”), but surrounded by a more contrasting cocktail of sounds, it's easier to hear his words as a simple complementary flavor.

A recent wave of artists is trying to forge a new kind of club-comedown-inflected songwriting, be it deer park's splintering dream pop, untitled (halo)'s druggy shoegaze, or the quilted trip-hop of urika's bedroom. Bondy may have seemed an unlikely candidate to throw his hat into this particular ring, but the more he channels his wide-ranging inspirations, the closer he gets to creating legitimately amorphous and unpredictable songs. When he's transforming his nasally whisper on “Halfmoon” into a drawling croak for “Dreamseed,” or luxuriating in rich details like the fog of strings that drowns out “Ur Ghost Is My Shadow,” you can hear him trying to reimagine his typically mulching sound design toward a new, more vulnerable context. It's a target he doesn't always hit, but when he does, it's fun to watch him adapting from one mode to the next, surrendering to the blur.

Massive Attack will perform at the São Paulo arena Espaco Unimed, on a bill with the Sepultura side project Cavalera, on Thursday, November 13. They timed the event to coincide with the COP30 International Climate Change Summit taking place in the Brazilian city of Belém. The bands partnered with the Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon to put on the show, in support of their fight to achieve climate justice and secure immediate recognition and protection for Indigenous lands.

Representatives of Indigenous movements will appear at the event itself, a press release notes, and the two bands will also work within Brazil to support Amazonian Indigenous movements. Sepultura founders Max and Iggor Cavalera will perform the band's Chaos AD album in full at the show.

Robert “3D” Del Naja added that he is honored to work with the brothers “in support of the extraordinary integrity and vital role of the Indigenous people of Brazil and the wider Amazon region. This is more than a passing of the mic. It's an opportunity to listen to the knowledge, moral authority and wisdom of the Indigenous alliances and help ensure they are heard in the negotiation rooms of COP30. We've never needed their presence within that distorted political space as much as we do right now.”

The announcement comes with a joint statement from three Indigenous bodies: the G9, the Coordination of Indigenous Organizations of the Brazilian Amazon, and the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil. It reads: “We, Indigenous peoples, step onto the stage as if lighting an ancient fire in the heart of the night. Together with Massive Attack and Cavalera, we turn sound into uprising. Our voices—alive, ancestral, untamed—will cut through the air, cross every border, and unite peoples, from the Amazon to the Pacific. We are the roots that resist, the future that insists. We have never left. We are here to remind you: The Earth remembers. And through us, it demands—dismantle the machine that devours her. The answer is already here. It rises from the very ground we walk together. The Answer Is Us. All of us. And we will advance.”

7.2

Genre:

Rock

Label:

self-released

Reviewed:

September 15, 2025

As far as indie rock origin stories go, “mailman moonlighting as a rock star gets word-of-mouth breakthrough, no label needed” is about as cool as it gets. Mike Maple started driving for USPS in 2020, shortly before his band Liquid Mike released its first two albums. Since then, the prolific group has put out a record a year of high-octane garage rock, drawing in a cult fanbase: Its 2023 album S/T struck a nerve on Bandcamp and Twitter, despite having almost no formal promotion; then, 2024's Paul Bunyan's Slingshot earned the group critical buzz and support slots with bands like Descendants, Joyce Manor, and Militarie Gun.

Like other Midwest rockers before them—The Replacements, Hüsker Dü, and Guided By Voices all come to mind—Liquid Mike like their runtimes short, their guitars loud, and their hooks easy to sing along to no matter how many beers you've had. The band's first five albums were mostly inspired by Maple's time driving the mail truck around Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and the small-town shenanigans he and his friends got up to off the clock. Their discography is filled with “get out of this town” anthems—but on their sixth album, Hell Is an Airport, Liquid Mike asks what happens when a hometown hero's journey takes him outside of his familiar surroundings.

A lot of what happens, it turns out, is more of the same. Most of these songs see Maple in head-on collision with the realization that the ennui of his home life won't disappear once he hits the road. “What are you running from?/A middle-aged Houdini/Locked ice box/Works hard to take it easy,” Maple sings on “Grand Am,” pondering the hours he spent at previous dead-end jobs—now that his dream job has become his day job, was the less predictable path worth it? “AT&T” features some subtle record scratching underneath its shimmery guitar progression, as Maple drags out the line, “How the days move slow” in a way that could apply both to the hurry-up-and-wait of his life as a touring musician, or the grind that preceded it when this kind of success was just a daydream.

Maple's fears of becoming an “out-of-touch out-of-towner” bubble to the surface of the speedy and metallic “Double Dutch,” though oftentimes Hell Is an Airport sees Maple and his band leaving town only to discover that the rest of the country embodies the same monotony they've been trying to escape. Abandoned malls, endless highways, and dead-eyed service workers are reminders of alienation on all fronts. Hell Is an Airport soundtracks industrial wastelands and suburban sprawl with wiry power-pop, crunched-up grunge-gaze, and even the occasional coughing fit of stoner metal.

A strain of nihilism runs through all Liquid Mike albums, but Hell Is an Airport is perhaps the band's darkest. Its most sobering moments, though, are also some of its most raucous—because sometimes, it's just plain fun to hear Mike Maple call himself a “prick” or an “evil bastard” over a steady shred and some rapid-fire drum fills. “You took his brother's name/He died when you were born/And you will die just the same,” Maple sings on “Crop Circles,” a song that blends the catchiest offerings of emo's second wave with turn-of-the-millennium alt-rock radio. Love song-slash-road song “'99,” which piles hooks upon hooks upon hooks into two and a half crushing minutes, is pure summertime joy from its gleefully Westerbergian opening couplet: “Nowhere you need to run to/Here comes the boy who loves you!” For a moment towards the end of the track, all other instruments cut out to make way for a spindly guitar solo—a single butterfly knocking around in the stomach of someone who's fallen hard.

The line between consistency and predictability is razor thin, and aside from the lyrical themes, Hell Is an Airport doesn't deviate much from the band's tried-and-true formula: compact songs with lyrics about boredom and burnout; muscular riffs; and overdubbed vocals that lend themselves to singalongs. It would get old if the songs weren't so damn catchy. “Run around, you won't find nothing better,” Maple sings on “Crop Circles.” History repeats itself, he suggests, and whether you're delivering the mail, touring with a band, or working any other job, boredom can be the only guarantee. The challenge, then, is finding fun in repetition; Liquid Mike can make even spinning your wheels sound like a joyride.

Theodore Shapiro has won the 2025 Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Original Dramatic Score). During last weekend's 2025 Creative Arts Emmys, the composer was honored for his work on Severance, beating out fellow nominees Brandon Roberts (Andor), Sherri Chung (Based on a True Story), Leo Birenberg and Zach Robinson (Cobra Kai), Antonio Sánchez (The Studio), and Cristobal Tapia de Veer (The White Lotus). It's Shapiro's second Emmy Award, following his win in the same category with Severance in 2022.

Shapiro's award is not to be confused with Outstanding Music Composition for a Limited or Anthology Series, Movie, or Special (Original Dramatic Score), which went to Mick Giacchino for The Penguin. Meanwhile, the Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics was given to Christopher Lennertz, for “Let's Put the Christ Back in Christmas,” from The Boys.

This year, countless musicians were nominated for Emmy Awards, including Kendrick Lamar, Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Kamasi Washington, Caroline Shaw, Hamilton Leithauser, Mark Ronson, Hans Zimmer, Devo co-founder Mark Mothersbaugh, and the Roots' Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson.

	President Donald Trump will be traveling London this week for a state visit with King Charles III and Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The trip has already drawn criticism given Trump's increasingly authoritarian governance of the United States, and one UK news station is adjusting its programming to ensure the American president's affinity for lies and misinformation isn't overlooked in the pageantry.  


	Channel 4, the publicly owned broadcaster founded in 1982, announced on Monday that it will greet Trump's visit with a televised special chronicling the many lies told by the president during the first months of his second administration. Trump v The Truth will air on September 17 and, according to a statement provided to The Hollywood Reporter, the special will likely be “the longest uninterrupted reel of untruths, falsehoods and distortions ever broadcast on television.”


	The special will catalogue over 100 of Trump's lies and falsehoods, with “brief text-based fact-checks, offering viewers the truth behind the tweets, speeches and soundbites.”

	











	Channel 4 Chief Content Officer Ian Katz told The Hollywood Reporter that he hopes the special programming “will remind viewers how disorientating and dangerous the world becomes when the most powerful man on earth shows little regard for the truth. And if President Trump cares to watch along after the state banquet, he may even clear up a few misconceptions.”


	This is not Trump's first visit with the British monarchy. Trump met with Queen Elizabeth II in 2019, during his first term, in a state visit that was marked by widespread protests in London, and a visibly frosty reception from the queen. While the queen reportedly found Trump to be “very rude,” the visit provided Trump with a level of public legitimacy on the international stage — which he hopes to burnish this week despite ever increasing turmoil at home. 

	











	Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will travel to the United Kingdom on Tuesday, and on Wednesday the president and his wife will be greeted by the prince and princess of Wales, William and Kate, at Windsor Castle before meeting King Charles and Queen Camilla for an inspection of the Guard of Honour at the historic royal residence. Trump is also expected to lay a wreath at the tomb of Elizabeth II, and attend a state banquet in the evening.

	On Thursday, the president is scheduled to meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer for a bilateral summit. The pair are expected to sign off on a series of economic and tech deals during the visit, including plans to develop a dozen nuclear power plants and nuclear powered data centers. 


	The visit comes just weeks after Trump met with Starmer in Scotland at one of his golf clubs. Trump inaugurated a new golf club on the same, taxpayer-funded trip. As European leaders wary of Trump's erratic economic whipsawing over the last few months attempt to butter up the American president, the masses should expect an excess of pomp and circumstance for this state visit that only the British monarchy could provide.

Hannah Einbinder used the Emmys stage to deliver a powerful message of support for the people of Gaza and those affected by the Trump administration's attacks on migrants.


	While accepting her award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her role in Hacks on Sunday night, Einbinder took a moment at the end of her speech to deliver a political message.


	After a comical speech about convincing herself that it was “cool” not to win after so many years, Einbinder — who wore an Artists4Ceasefire pin on her dress — declared: “Finally, I just want to say: Go Birds, fuck ICE, and free Palestine.” (The “Birds” mention was, of course, a nod to the Eagles, who defeated the Kansas City Chiefs earlier on Sunday.)


	On the broadcast, both CBS and Paramount+ cut out the curse word, cutting to a wide shot of the awards show crowd, before zooming back in on the actress for the end of the word “ICE.”

Hannah Einbinder says “Go Birds, F— ICE and Free Palestine” after winning an #Emmy for #Hacks


	‪“It's an issue that's very close to my heart for many reasons,” she told the press room backstage. “It Is my obligation as a Jewish person to distinguish Jews from the state of Israel, because our religion and our culture is such an important and long-standing institution that is really separate to this sort of ethnonationalist state.”‬

	Einbinder wasn't the only Hacks actor to address the conflict between Israel and Gaza at the awards show. Earlier in the night, actress Meg Stalter, who is typically known for her over-the-top outfits, instead wore a black leather bag emblazoned with a white tape reading, “CEASE FIRE!”

Our religion and our culture is such an important and long-standing institution that is really separate to this sort… pic.twitter.com/FNVTji7VC3


	On her Instagram story, Einbinder's last few posts were related to Israel's “relentless bombs” on the Gaza region. She's one of the main actors to participate with Artists4Ceasefire, even co-posting a call-to-action noting the “two million Palestinians in Gaza face unprecedented levels of starvation” back in July.


	“We call on our leaders, all those with power in the U.S. and around the globe, to use their influence and ACT NOW and demand Israel LET AID IN,” read the July statement. “Our call has not changed— we demand an immediate and permanent ceasefire, immediate, unrestricted delivery of aid to civilians in Gaza, and the release of all the hostages.”

	After Einbinder left the stage, Emmys host Nate Bargatze joked about her usage of a curse word: “She also cursed… I'll start a swear jar real fast,” he said, referencing his ongoing Boys and Girls Club fund, which he said will increase or decrease depending on the length of Emmys' acceptance speeches.


	In the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series category, Einbinder beat out last year's winner Liza Colón-Zayas, The Studio‘s Catherine O'Hara and Kathryn Hahn, Abbott Elementary‘s Janelle James and Sheryl Lee Ralph, and Shrinking‘s Jessica Williams.

	If the 77th Annual Emmy Awards had a theme, it would be first-timers. Television's biggest night was emceed by comedian Nate Bargatze at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles, marking his first time hosting a major awards show. While the evening featured familiar awards-show beats including corny musical tributes and iconic cast reunions, the highlights of the night were the wins for rookie shows and actors, and for a few longtime also-rans. 


	On his first nomination, Tramell Tillman became the first Black man to win the Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. Netflix's devastating limited series Adolescence swept its categories, with Owen Cooper becoming the youngest winner in his category — off his very first acting job. In its first season, Apple's love letter to Hollywood, The Studio, rivaled Severance in wins and nominations. Max's new medical procedural The Pitt won the coveted Outstanding Drama award at the end of the night. And even established stars like Cristin Milioti, Katherine LaNasa, Jeff Hiller, and Noah Wyle got to take their first spins accepting awards on the Emmy stages. Perhaps most meaningful of all, especially given that the telecast was being broadcast by CBS, the soon-to-no-longer-exist Late Show With Stephen Colbert took home the talk series statuette for the first time. But those feel-good moments couldn't be celebrated without an awards ceremony equally full of mishaps and general mayhem. Here are the best, worst, weirdest, and wildest moments from the ceremony.   


	Sometimes the best new bit is an old bit. That's a lesson comedian Nate Bargatze took to heart for his first time hosting a major awards show. With the help of SNL stars Bowen Yang, James Austin Johnson, and Mikey Day, Bargatze opened the 77th Emmy Awards by re-creating his viral sketch about George Washington dreaming about the future of America, this time from the perspective of Philo T. Farnsworth — the inventor of television. Instead of a tri-corner hat, Bargatze donned a white lab coat, but Farnsworth's dreams were equally baffling as Washington's, including a channel for history that's all about aliens, shows for wives that only focus on real-life murderers, and a new kind of television, “streaming,” that only exists for “companies to lose money.” The skit had plenty of nods to nominees like Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, The Bear, and The Pitt, while cashing in on some of Bargatze's internet clout. It was a smart move, especially considering how Bargatze spent the rest of his time as host freezing, dropping jokes entirely, and generally looking lost. Maybe he should've dreamed up a better rehearsal.  —C.T. Jones


	It speaks to the greatness of The Pitt that LaNasa beat out four stars of the Emmys juggernaut The White Lotus (and, you know, Patricia Arquette for Severance). It also speaks to the power of working hard and staying in the game. LaNasa has been acting for more than three decades, making one-episode appearances in everything from Seinfeld to Touched by an Angel to ER, and doing short arcs on procedurals like NYPD Blue and sitcoms like Two and a Half Men. Now, The Pitt's beleaguered, badass charge nurse Dana is the role she was born to play. LaNasa gave a shout-out to executive producer John Wells in her acceptance speech for Best Supporting Actress. “I'm so much better when you're around,” she said. “Mostly because I don't want to get fired.” Here's hoping Dana doesn't actually quit the ER, and we get more of her in Season Two. —Angie Martoccio


	In the beginning of the evening, Bargatze announced that he was starting the telecast with a $100,000 donation to the Boys & Girls Club of America — but there was a catch. For any speech over 45 seconds, he'd deduct $1,000 per second; for any speech under 45 seconds, he'd add $1,000 per second. It was a cheeky effort to prevent winners from droning on too long, and while it was somewhat charming and funny at first, the bit quickly became exhausting and tacky, as a meter wildly ticked up and down (mostly down) at the bottom of the screen while each recipient gave their long list of thank yous … or just scampered off the stage without saying much of anything — which is, ah, not very entertaining! (You know a joke is lame when even the shy kid from Adolescence says, “Uh-oh, I'm going down!”) We knew all along that Bargatze would make a big donation regardless of the speeches — why torture the audience, and the children you genuinely want to highlight and help, with emotional porn? —A.M.


	When the beloved Jennifer Coolidge took the stage to present the award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, she was warmly welcomed by a crowd eager to see what her brand of kooky comedy would bring to the moment. On this night, that kookiness ended up being a slow-moving, mostly awkward, rambling bit that earned precious few laughs. The one good joke — Coolidge saying she had played a grandmother mid-colonoscopy on The Pitt in a scene that was cut for time — was immediately forgotten in the silence surrounding some riffs on the number of actresses who could've been nominated, the time Coolidge won, and a nominees group chat she's no longer a part of. Coolidge's shtick works best when she's given room to riff — exactly what you don't get at an awards show that is desperate to finish on time. But suffering through this meandering talk immediately after host Nate Bargatze had admonished people to keep their speeches short only made it feel all the slower. —C.T.J.


	We're still eight days away from the start of fall, but the Emmys kicked the season off a little early this year with a Gilmore Girls reunion. For a few minutes, the stage transformed into the charming town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut, as Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel appeared on their front porch. “Twenty-five years ago, a show called Gilmore Girls premiered, and apparently took the season of fall hostage,” Graham said to laughter. Despite their “autumnal dominance,” the duo joked about how broke their little show was — saving up all year for “one snow episode” and having to eat the leftovers of Drew Carey's sheetcake. They were there to present the award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, but in a show packed with lame bits and quick speeches, their famous quick-witted banter (originally crafted by showrunner Amy Sherman-Palladino) felt very welcome. —A.M.


Golden Girls was an Eighties classic that made superstars of its cast of veteran comedy actresses — Bea Arthur, Rue McClanahan, Estelle Getty, and the great Betty White. Centering a show on four older women who were single was downright revolutionary for the time, and it turned out to be comedy gold for seven seasons. The show earned 68 Emmy nominations with 11 wins over its run, and each of its stars won one, too. It was certainly worthy of celebration — but why was that celebration nothing more than a performance of the theme song by a trio of country singers on a lame replica of the original kitchen set? Were the golden girls fans of country music? The show was set in Miami, not Nashville, but maybe? Is Reba McEntire a huge Golden Girls fan? Are Little Big Town singers Karen Fairchild and Kimberly Schlapman? Maybe! We'll never know, because they just sang a song, gave out an award, and left the stage. —Maria Fontoura


	While the Boys & Girls Clubs of America were hemorrhaging cash thanks to some lengthy acceptance speeches, there was at least one kid who won big at the 77th Emmys. Owen Cooper, who made his acting debut in Netflix's four-episode Adolescence, took home the award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie — making him the youngest winner in that category at 15. His stunning performance as 13-year-old murderer Jamie Miller beat out work by the likes of Oscar winner Javier Bardem, veteran character actor Bill Camp, and writer-comedian-mensch Rob Delaney. “I think tonight proves that if you listen and you focus and you step out of your comfort zone, you can achieve anything,” Cooper said during his acceptance speech. “I was nothing about three years ago. I'm here now. Who cares if you get embarrassed?” —C.T.J.


	Stephen Colbert received a standing ovation at the beginning of the evening, when he presented the award for Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, casually handed Harrison Ford his resume (featuring his teenage headshot), and hilariously asked, “Is anyone hiring?” He returned to the stage later that night to accept the Emmy for Outstanding Talk Series, two months after CBS canceled The Late Show (the network claimed this was a financial decision, but we know it was political). And while it was technically the show's second Emmy — they won last week at the Creative Arts ceremony — their win tonight was momentous and poignant. Colbert, who's hosted the show for a decade, capped his tender speech with a nod to Prince's “Let's Go Crazy”: “Stay strong, be brave, and if the elevator tries to bring you down, go crazy and punch a higher floor!” —A.M.

	The Emmys celebrated the lives of many celebrities who've worked in the TV industry over the past year during the gala event in Los Angeles on Sunday night. Vince Gill and Lainey Wilson provided the soundtrack, a eulogy in the form of Gill's “Go Rest High on That Mountain,” for the farewell. 


	During the performance, an array of performers, writers, directors, executives, and other TV industry creatives were honored. Among them were actors like Teri Garr, Michelle Trachtenberg, four-time Emmy winner Maggie Smith, and 


George Wendt, the Cheers star who earned six Emmy nominations for his portrayal of Norm Peterson on Cheers, was mentioned. As was two-time nominee Loni Anderson (for WKRP in Cincinnati), and John Amos, the Good Times star, who received a nomination for his work on the classic miniseries Roots. 


	The tribute also included nods to Twin Peaks co-creator David Lynch; Robin Kaye, the American Idol music supervisor who was killed in her home alongside her husband earlier this year; original Wheel of Fortune host Chuck Woolery; and longtime Simpsons composer Alf Clausen. Heavy metal legend and reality TV pioneer, Ozzy Osbourne, was also featured, while the in memoriam section closed with the towering musician, producer, and composer, Quincy Jones.

	Prior to Gill and Wilson's performance, the in memoriam section was introduced by Phylicia Rashad, who paid special tribute to her Cosby Show co-star, Malcolm-Jamal Warner.


	“He was a beloved teenager in an iconic television series who the world watched grow into manhood,” she said. “Like all our friends and colleagues who transitioned this past year, Malcolm-Jamal Warner remains in our hearts. Tonight, as is tradition at the Emmys, we remember them not just for their immense talent, but also for the way they made us believe in something bigger, the best that is within us.”

	











	Gill and Wilson performed a duet of “Go Rest High on That Mountain,” a song that Gill wrote and recorded on his 1994 album, When Love Finds You. The singers posted a video of a rehearsal of the song to social media a few days before the broadcast.

He completed writing it in 1993 after his older brother, Bob, died of a heart attack. Ricky Skaggs and Patty Lovelace provided background vocals on the studio rendition. Gill sang the song at George Jones' funeral.


	Comedian Nate Bargatze hosted the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences' 77th annual event, which took place at L.A.'s Peacock Theater. The event aired on CBS and Paramount+. Severance, The Penguin, and The Studio were the most nominated programs of the night.

	Among the many treasures now on display at the just-opened David Bowie Centre in London is a letter Lady Gaga wrote the legendary musician in the early 2010s. 


	The short note wasn't dated, but it was likely sent around late 2012 or early 2013. Gaga mentions having received an “advanced copy” of Bowie's new album, and later says she's finishing her own LP, Artpop, which eventually came out in November 2013. The Bowie album Gaga received was probably The Next Day, which arrived in March 2013. 


	Gaga told Bowie it was “truly an honor” to receive the album, adding, “I cried, in fact, listening to each song. How does he know I exist? I feel as though my entire career has been an artistic plea for you to notice me.”


	After telling Bowie that she was finishing Artpop, she told him she was “in New York and would be grateful and honored to meet you.” The letter is signed “Love + Art, Gaga.”

	While Gaga and Bowie never did meet, the former later revealed that she kept up a correspondence with Bowie. After Bowie's death in 2016, Gaga led a tribute to the late musician at the Grammy Awards, performing a medley that included “Space Oddity,” “Fashion,” “Let's Dance,” “Rebel Rebel,” and “Heroes.”

	Speaking with NPR around the same time, Gaga spoke with NPR about Bowie's influence, saying he introduced her to “a lifestyle of total immersion in music, fashion, art and technology.” Remembering the life-changing experience of encountering his album Aladdin Sane, she said, “That was just the beginning of my artistic birth.”

	











	The David Bowie Centre opened this past weekend at the Victoria and Albert East Storehouse in London. The collection boasts a trove of pieces from Bowie's archive, including recently discovered notes for an 18th-century-set musical the musician was working on before his death.

Iron Maiden frontman Bruce Dickinson offered his take on the American national anthem at Pittsburgh's Acrisure Stadium on Sunday. 


	The English musician was asked to perform the song at the Pittsburgh Steelers' first home game of the season against the Seattle Seahawks, noting on Instagram that it was “a huge honour” to be invited. Dickinson left the field to chants of “U.S.A! U.S.A!”


	“I'll let you in to a secret,” Dickinson said in a recent interview on podcast The Charismatic Voice. “I've got to sing the national anthem in Pittsburgh for the Pittsburgh Steelers. They've asked me to do this. I'm going to do it a cappella and stuff, and as long as you start at the right place, you're good to go.”

A post shared by Bruce Dickinson (@brucedickinsonhq)


	Fans were entertained by the NFL‘s decision to enlist a musician from the U.K. to perform America's anthem at a very American sport. “The most random thing I saw today was a British man singing the American national anthem,” one commenter wrote on Instagram. Another added, “Why is a Brit singing the American national anthem? Especially at this current time?”

	Iron Maiden is celebrating their 50th anniversary in 2025, with a new documentary about the metal greats is slated to be released later this year. Directed by Malcolm Venville, the as-yet-untitled film will dig into Iron Maiden's remarkable 50-year history and legacy, telling the story from the perspective of both band and fans (including famous ones like Javier Bardem, Lars Ulrich, and Gene Simmons). The film will also feature interviews with key members from throughout the band's run, including the last interview with original vocalist Paul Di'Anno, who died last year.

Buried in all the news this week was another congressional hearing on UFOs.

For some reason, our government now prefers the acronym UAP, which stood for Unidentified Aerial Phenomena until they changed it again Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. So, in other words, an unidentified flying object or UFO, right?

The highlight of this week's congressional hearing was a leaked military video purportedly taken by a U.S. military MQ-9 Reaper Drone showing a hellfire missile striking sphere-like object in the skies off the coast of Yemen and having little to no effect.

Having lived on the Space Coast for 24 years, I've long wondered what the military and people at NASA know about UFOs and have been surprised at the lack of information made available to the public regarding the possibility that we are not alone.

After watching the video, I was dumbfounded. Is this the smoking gun, the proof that so many have longed for? Was this finally proof that an alien invasion was imminent?

I sought out some experts in the field.

Author, researcher and filmmaker Mike Ricksecker, who's been featured on the History Channel's “Ancient Aliens and The UnXplained” shows, called the release of the video footage an ""astonishing revelation.""

But he had questions similar to mine.

""First of all, why was the drone firing upon the sphere?"" he said. ""Did someone authorize the firing of the missile or was this simply automatic by the drone?""

I spoke to a family member who served several tours in Afghanistan and he told me there is a chain of command and permission needed before a Hellfire Missile is fired.

""Was there any attempt at communication? Was there some sort of perceived threat and, if so, what was that threat?"" Ricksecker added.

""I believe those are the most pertinent questions, but upon seeing this footage we also have to ask ourselves, what sort of technology could cause this result? The Hellfire Missile was designed for anti-armor attacks and is able to destroy any known armored vehicle in the world, and it lost. The target, while it seemed to lose a few bits and veered from its course momentarily, rebounded almost immediately and kept going. That's not a known technology we have here on Earth ... unless something else is being hidden from us, militarily or otherwise.""

Was it finally time to build my bunker in the backyard? Were the monsters really due on Maple Street?

Not so fast, says Adam Frank, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Rochester whose research delves into Theoretical Astrophysics, and in particular the hydrodynamic and magneto-hydrodynamic evolution of matter.

Frank said there are way too many unknowns to make any sort of scientific declaration based on what he described as a ""grainy video with blobs on it that comes with a predigested story.""

""If you really want to know what it is, you've got to do a proper investigation of it,"" he said. ""That means knowing what time of day is it? What instrument is being used? Where is the sun when this is happening? Right now that can't be answered. We're just given this thing and we're told it's an amazing mystery.""

The other thing to take into account, Frank said, was that the object was not moving very fast since Hellfire Missiles are used mainly to attack stationary or slower-moving objects like tanks and helicopters.

But the biggest takeaway from my discussion with Frank was something I hadn't noticed on the video or even considered. The missile never detonated.

""It's not like you see the missile hit whatever the thing was and explode in a giant explosion and then the thing propagates away from it like in one of those science fiction movies,"" Frank said.

""It looks like it's a glancing blow right which means that the targeting wasn't that great. What you see is the missile's trajectory changes like it it clearly knocks into something and it diverts the path. You see it move, so this is not some kind of super alien technology which is impervious to anything, it kind of behaves like you might expect something to behave if it got a glancing blow from a fast moving object.""

OK, so maybe it's not from outer space. But what the heck is it?

Florida Congresswoman and chair of Declassification of Federal Secrets Anna Paulina Luna, R-Florida, wants to know as well. She has been calling on the government to be more transparent when it comes to these types of things.

""From Roswell to the coast of Jacksonville, the sightings of UFO's have rarely been explained by the people who have first-hand accounts of these situations,"" she said last year.

""This is largely due to the lack of transparency by our own government and the failure of our elected leaders to make good on their promises to release explanations and footage and mountains of classified documents that continue to be hidden from the American people.""

I've only recently come across the term “Peer State Adversary,” meaning a country with similar technology as ours that is adversarial. We used to call them enemies. Anyway, more likely than an alien spacecraft, the object on the video could be a drone operated by one of those adversarial countries. And if that's the case, Frank explains, the military would have good reason to keep tight-lipped about it.

For example, Frank said, what if a country like China or Iran was testing the camera-spoofing technology of an experimental drone? Our military leaders would not want to tip their hand and reveal to those nations what we know about them.

OK, makes sense.

“As somebody who studies the possibility of life in the universe professionally, I would love if we found aliens,"" Frank said. ""That would answer the question I've been interested in my whole life. But there's just nothing there to be able to make that giant leap without the right kind of scientific evidence.""

I gotta admit being relieved after speaking with Frank. The bunker can wait, for now.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q='unidentified+flying+objects'","Whistleblowers detail ‘UFO' experiences to Congressional Oversight Task Force","https://new.finalcall.com/2025/09/15/whistleblowers-detail-ufo-experiences-to-congressional-oversight-task-force/","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 13:12:10 GMT","

More whistleblowers have spoken out about the truth about so-called Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) also called Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs). They are seeking, along with some members of Congress, protection, transparency, accountability and certainty about the origin of such craft.

However, not only is the so-called UFO phenomenon a reality, the Most Honorable Elijah Muhammad, Eternal Leader of the Nation of Islam, taught on the wheels and the reality of the Mother Plane in the early 1930s, first described to him by His Teacher. 

Allah (God) in the Person of Master W. Fard Muhammad, the Great Mahdi. The Most Honorable Elijah Muhammad described the purpose of the wheels in His book, “Message to the Blackman in America.”

In His Book, “The Fall of America,” in the chapter, “The Mother Plane,” He writes: “The Mother Plane, according to what has been described of it by the devil scientists, is capable of not only staying up for long periods of time; but it is also capable of eluding the scientists. 

They want to attack and destroy it; but if a plane did get close enough to attempt to carry out this purpose, it would be destroyed instead. The White man has learned that this is not a plane to be played with. Planes come out of the Mother Plane.”

Recently, the U.S. Congressional Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets called for more transparency after whistleblowers testified about their concerns and the existence of so-called UAPs/UFOs.

During the “Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection” hearing held Sept. 9, witnesses comprised of military veterans and a counsel for the Project on Government Oversight called for the disclosure of such phenomena and information held by federal agencies. 

For too long, the issue of UAPs has been shrouded in secrecy, stigma, and in some cases outright dismissal, said task force Chairwoman, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), during opening remarks for the hearing.

“Today, I want to state clearly: this is not science fiction or creating speculation. This is about national security, government accountability, and the American people's right to the truth,” she stated.

Elected representatives are duty bound to follow the facts, wherever they lead, and to ensure those facts are not buried under classification stamps or bureaucratic excuses, continued Rep. Luna. 

U.S. Air Force veteran Jeffrey Nuccetelli said that between 2003 and 2005, five UAP incidents occurred at Vandenberg Air Force Base, home to the National Missile Defense Project, a top national security priority, she explained. 

They were conducting launches deemed by the National Reconnaissance Office as “the most important in 25 years,” said Mr. Nuccetelli, about incursions he said began on October 14, 2003.

“Boeing contractors reported a massive, glowing red square silently hovering over two missile defense sites. After several minutes, it drifted east and vanished behind the hills,” he reported.

Mr. Nuccetelli also reported a witness seeing a strange light over the ocean, heading toward the base. The object descended, hovered briefly or landed, then vanished instantly into the night sky. “The witness was later threatened and told to keep quiet about the incident, discouraging further reports,” he stated.

In 2005, he said, he watched an object start “maneuvering like a butterfly and would vanish and reappear in a different patch of sky. The object dropped steadily in altitude, and it vanished, then reappeared 200 feet over my house. 

It was a huge glowing orb of blue-white light, but it appeared solid and the light did not radiate from it. It vanished again, and reappeared a moment later in a different position. 

The orb then gently accelerated and we watched it for about 40 seconds as it receded into the night sky and became indistinguishable from the stars.”

Alexandro Wiggins is an active duty U.S. Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer (Operations Specialist) with approximately 23 years of service, whose written testimony to the task force included seeing a “self-luminous, “Tic-Tac”-shaped object in his experience aboard USS Jackson on February 15, 2023, off the Southern California coast.

The object then linked up with three similar objects, according to Chief Wiggins. “All four departed simultaneously in a highly synchronized, near-instantaneous manner. No sonic boom or conventional propulsion signatures were observed,” he continued.

Chief Wiggins underscored the safety issue of crews observing objects that maneuver or accelerate in ways that do not match known profiles and do so near U.S. ships and aircraft. 

George Knapp, chief investigative reporter for KLAS-TV in Las Vegas, emphasized at the hearing he's not a whistleblower or a UFO witness, but became hooked on the subject because of massive paper trail piles of government documents which he said paints a very different picture than what the public, the press and Congress have been told about UFOs.

“I was ticked off that they were lying to us,” said Mr. Knapp. While the public has been told over and over since the late 40s, “there's nothing to worry about here” or that these mysterious craft seen by millions of people in the skies, in the oceans, over the land, “are not real. They're not a threat. The witnesses are wrong. They're crackpots. Don't believe it,” evidence indicates otherwise, he said.

“Documents from military and intelligence personnel behind closed doors admit that ‘these things are real.' They're not fictitious. They can fly in formation, they're evasive, and they outperform any aircraft known to exist, including ours,” said Mr. Knapp.

Dylan Borland, a former geospatial intelligence specialist for the U.S. Air Force from 2010-2013, is a federal whistleblower. He told the task force that he has testified to both the Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) and All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) with direct firsthand knowledge of and experience with craft and technologies “that are not ours and that are reportedly operating without Congressional oversight.”

Rep. Eric Burlison (R-Mo.) shared a video during the hearing “captured by a U.S. reaper drone shows a glowing orb off the coast of Yemen. Then in the video, a Hellfire missile suddenly struck the unidentified object and bounced off it,” reported cbsnews.com. 

The video was from October 30, 2024. “‘We've never seen a Hellfire missile hit a target and bounce off,' said Lue Elizondo, a former senior intelligence official with the Pentagon,” the network reported.

The reality of the so-called UAP/UFO phenomena further confirms the Divine Truth taught by the Most Honorable Elijah Muhammad which is also verified in scripture. “There is no known equal of the Mother Plane. 

This is the reason why she is called the Mother Plane. The Mother Plane is made for the purpose of destroying the present world. She has no equal,” He wrote in “The Fall of America,” in the section, “Ezekiel's Prophecy of the Wheel.”

“The Mother Plane and her work is a display of the power of the mightiest God, Master Fard Muhammad, to Whom praises are due forever. Master Fard Muhammad, to Whom praises are due forever, is the Wisest and Best Knower; He is the Mightiest of Them All,” the Most Honorable Elijah Muhammad wrote.

“‘O wheel,' says the prophet Ezekiel. She was so high up in the sky that she looked dreadful. She is capable of staying away from you who plan the destruction of her. She is capable of confusing you who would try to reach her with your means of destruction,” the Most Honorable Elijah Muhammad continued.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=uap","UAP appoints Simon Monks as group sales and marketing director","https://internationalfireandsafetyjournal.com/uap-appoints-simon-monks-director/","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 07:04:00 GMT","

UAP has announced that Simon Monks has been appointed as its new Group Sales and Marketing Director.

According to UAP, Monks joins with almost 20 years of experience in the door and fenestration sector, including senior management positions in the UK and overseas.

The company reported that he previously worked his way up through the hardware industry, moving from sales roles into board-level positions.

It added that Monks has spent a decade as a director, including seven years as Managing Director, during which time he gained experience across a range of international markets.

The appointment, it said, follows UAP's recent acquisition by Allegion plc through one of its subsidiaries.

On his appointment, Simon Monks, Group Sales and Marketing Director at UAP, said: “I was drawn to UAP because of its ambition, growth plans, and reputation for innovation, with products like the Armasmart and Kinetica ranges driving progress in the industry.

“In such an exciting time for the business group, I can't wait to get stuck into shaping its future alongside the stellar team.”

UAP explained that it was founded in 1996 and is headquartered in Manchester.

The company said its product portfolio includes fire-rated hardware, locking systems, and door and window security products.

It added that its design approach centres on customer requirements and responding to ongoing developments in fire and security standards.

The business stated that its solutions are intended to support both safety and security in residential and commercial applications.

It reported that the appointment of Monks supports its wider strategy under Allegion ownership.

Steve Cox, Managing Director of UAP, said: “Simon has joined us at an integral stage of our growth journey. His market knowledge and industry standing are exceptional, and his leadership and customer skills are key additions to our team.

“Simon's insights will be fundamental as we consolidate our UK plans, including targeting repair markets, and expand into international markets that are new to us.”

UAP explained that its acquisition by Allegion plc has created new opportunities to extend its reach and resources.

The company noted that Allegion is a global security products provider with operations in several regions.

It stated that this wider backing will support UAP's efforts to expand into new territories.

The business added that the leadership changes form part of aligning its growth strategy with Allegion's global network.

Reddit user Exotic_Thing_2850 recently asked, ""What's the creepiest, most unexplainable thing you've ever seen with your own eyes that still haunts you to this day?"" Read the responses, if you dare! And good luck sleeping tonight...or ever again!

1.""I live in a rural area of my state. Think 'driving 30 minutes to get to a store' type of rural. This actually happened recently. I was outside with my dogs at around 3:00 a.m. (a story all on its own). Our house backs up to the woods, but a clearing is a few yards in. So the dogs and I are near the edge of the woods when I hear war drums. I called my dog to come inside with me and turned to walk away, but he was firmly planted, looking in the direction of the noise, and would not move. After about a minute, the sound of the drums stopped, and there was a roaring noise. It was like the sound of thousands of people rushing into battle. It wasn't windy that night, but we were hit with a heavy gust of wind, and all the noise stopped. It thoroughly freaked out my dog...and me. I haven't heard it since.""

2.""When my sister and I were very young, we had a sandbox in our backyard. One day, we were playing in it, and a hand came up from the sand, grabbed my sister, and pulled her down. My sister was screaming and crying. I grabbed her and pulled her back up. We both ran to get our mom. She didn't believe us. To this day, we both still talk about that and can't explain what happened. So creepy!""

—Appropriate_Music_24

3.""On multiple occasions, in 2004, when I was around 15, I'd suddenly wake up around 3:00 a.m. to find every single light on in the house. My mom worked nights, dad didn't live with us, and my brother and sister were still out cold when I checked. On one of those nights, all the lights were turned on, the bathtub faucet was blasting, the tub was nearly overflowing, and the bathroom sink and kitchen faucets were also running full blast. The water and lights at night terrified me so much that I ran and shook my older sister awake, yelling, 'Did you do this?!' She shrugged me off and had no idea what I was talking about. Same with my younger brother. After a couple of nights of it, I started yelling for whoever was there to please stop. I said I acknowledged their presence and now needed them to leave. It never happened again.""

4.""My sister and I moved in together in our mid-20s. She had the ensuite upstairs, while I had a room down the hall from the open-plan kitchen/lounge/dining room. One night, shortly after heading to bed, we both heard a noise in the kitchen and immediately texted each other, 'Was that you?' Nope. Then we both heard giggling. Fucking GIGGLING. We met in the kitchen, turned all the lights on, and there was…nothing. We spent about three hours sitting on the patio, chain-smoking cigarettes (we had long stopped smoking at that point) to calm ourselves. We were too scared to go back inside.""

""A couple of nights later, we were watching TV on the couch. We had a fan on in the center of the kitchen counter, not remotely close to the edge, and it suddenly flew off, the plug pulled out of the socket, and it landed on the floor. Neither of us was even close to it. There was no breeze, nothing. It was a heavy metal fan.""

—Born-Guard3733

5.""I have a brother who is eight years older than I am. My mom used to talk about a creepy, grinning version of my brother that she and a babysitter saw when he was little. It seemed to age with him, and my mom saw him multiple times. The babysitter saw him once and freaked the fuck out. I saw him when I was in high school. My brother worked multiple jobs and was gone a lot. To help him make some extra cash, I would clean his room and do his laundry each week. I usually stayed up late Saturday nights to watch Mad TV and SNL while folding laundry. I started feeling like I was being watched, but my brother was at work and everyone else was asleep. When I turned to look, my brother was peeking around the hallway wall at me with a super creepy grin on his face. All I could see were his hands holding the wall and his head sticking out around the corner, but that grin was freaky.""

""I instantly thought my brother was messing with me, so I said something along the lines of, 'Ugh. Fuck off,' and looked back at the TV. Then I remembered that he wasn't even home, and the hairs on my arms stood up. I looked back, and he was gone. But the next morning, I told my mom what I had seen, and she just nodded in understanding.""

—Katemonster89

6.""More cool than creepy, but when I was younger, we would always play hide and seek in the dark, but in the woods. One time, I was hiding in a tree, and I saw two kids walking on the path holding hands — a little girl and a boy about the same age. They were both dressed in early 1920s-style clothes and just walking super calmly as if they had nowhere to go. When I told my mom and described them, she mentioned seeing the same little boy multiple times as a child in her room. He would come from her antique armoire and just sit at the end of her bed. Not sure about the little girl, but it was so fascinating and trippy, even as a child. Just writing this gave me chills, but not in a bad way. They seemed to be very relaxed and not worried about me at all. Never saw them again.""

—cottoncandyskylines4

7.""I was driving home from work and got struck by another car. I have no memory of the crash itself; I just recall waking up on the side of the road. As I was lying there, I noticed movement in a stand of trees a ways off from the road. I couldn't make out anything initially, except movement, until it stepped into the beams of my vehicle's headlights. Picture a werewolf with black fur, no visible ears, and a wolf's skull for a head, and that's about what I saw. The thing walked over to the other car and seemed to snoop around like it was looking for something, but it didn't find it, so it made its way over to my vehicle. And when it saw me, I could see its eyes light up. But all it ended up doing was standing over me and looking down at me as I stared up at it, too scared to so much as blink.""

""But after what felt like hours, the thing finally blinked, and next thing I know, I'm being loaded into the back of an ambulance.""

—Strange_Stage1311

8.""I once saw a 'man' in my closet. I was around 9 or 10, and always had a vivid imagination. I was also terrified of the dark and had problems with nightmares and insomnia my whole life (I still do at 24, tbh). One night, I woke up and there was a man in my closet. He was tall, wearing a black suit and a blank white face, and had symbols on his cheeks (think Jigsaw's markings, but not swirls; they were symbols). I ran into my parents' room, sobbing. I didn't sleep in my own bed for weeks. I still don't 100% think it was a dream, but I'm not sure what else it could have been.""

9.""My mom passed several months prior. I woke up around 3:00 a.m. with the lights on in the living room, and the TV was on at full volume. I walked out of my room into the living room, and my mom was sitting in my rocker/swivel chair, knitting with her back to me, the TV at full blast, and all the lights on. I turned to look at the clock, and it was 3:44 a.m. I looked back; it was dark, the TV was off, and nothing was in the chair but an afghan my mom knitted for me. I lost it.""

—Got_Bent

10.""When my son was 5 (he is now 20), he, my now ex-wife, my infant daughter, and I were traveling back from my parents' house after dark. They live about two hours away. My aunt 'R' had recently passed away, maybe two months earlier. My son randomly said, 'I see Aunt R!' We asked him where, and he said she was up on the hill watching us. There was a hill at this particular location, but there weren't any lights on it for him to see a person on it. Then, a couple of months ago, I was visiting my mom, and she mentioned that around this time, she was watching my son at their house, and he was playing in the backyard. She heard him talking to someone, carrying on a conversation, and when she asked whom he was taking to, he said it was Aunt R.""

—Kahless-1

11.""When I was in high school, my mom had a nightmare and we shared the experience. The way our house was set up, my bedroom was the first in the hallway, then my brother's, the bathroom, the laundry room, and my mom was at the end of the hallway. While we were all in bed (I sleep with my door open because of the pets), I heard her gasp, but didn't really think anything of it. A few moments later, a shadow as tall as my doorframe walked past my door. I got up and immediately started flicking on lights and asking if she had walked up the hallway. Of course, my mom saw since she was awake, and we walked through the house. I went to get into bed with her after we found nothing, and she was telling me about her nightmare, which was that a tall man in a wife-beater was at the end of her bed with an axe, swinging it towards her (which is why she gasped awake in the first place).""

""While lying there, we heard and felt knocking on the bed's footboard. We just sat there in silence, holding each other's hands, until it stopped, and asked one another if we both heard it. My brother stayed asleep throughout the entire thing, and nothing else ever happened, but boy, that was a scary ass night. I definitely don't look at my doorway for too long at nighttime if I can help it, and I have fairy lights in my room, so it's never completely dark.""

—chickpeadawg

12.""My sister and I were walking, and I said, 'Hey, let's take a detour through the woods for a change.' We get about one-third of the way through, and I hear someone shouting my name deep into the woods to my right. I freak out for a second and look at my sister, who is to my left. She is looking behind her, incredibly terrified. I look behind us but see nothing. I decide to distract my sister by talking about my day. We leave the woods, and I lie on the grass. She looks at me and tells me in a scared voice, 'I heard someone shout my name behind me and it sounded like our older brother, but as if he was young.' We both heard a voice of our older brother saying our names, but separately, in different places. For me, to my right, for my sister, it was behind her. We speculated for fun, said we went through some portal or something, and lightly laughed. But we are scarred for life. Since then, I know I will never ever take that route again.""

13.""I had a very overactive imagination as a child, and it would often lead to either hallucinations or daydreams that blurred the line between real and not. One day, I blinked, and the white flowered bathroom wallpaper was replaced with a yellow and brown striped wallpaper. The vinyl floor was replaced with a lush brown carpet, and the vanity was replaced with a half-decomposed corpse that was somehow still alive enough to stare at me until I blinked again, and it disappeared.""

14.""I saw a lady in a white dress jump off a bridge into the river below. It was dark and there were no lights about. I got out of the car and rushed over, but there was no sign of her or anything that looked white, and there were no ripples in the water. Freaked me the fuck out.""

15.""My sister and I saw Santa Claus in the living room in our house. What should've been a magical experience was actually terrifying. I was 3 and my sister was 5. We awoke to loud, hard shuffling and thumping noises on our roof. We wondered what it was, then we noticed someone was in our living room. Our room was down a skinny hall, and from our room, we looked into the living room and saw him. We saw a robust man dressed in red with his back turned to us in front of our Christmas tree. He wasn't putting the presents down; he was sprinkling gold, shimmering dust onto them. Santa Claus, dressed in his red and white velvet suit, hat, white beard, everything. It was very obvious who it was. It was weird, though; he looked like an old school movie projection with fuzzy edges and static. Like a ghost.""

""We immediately looked in our parents' room. Our parents were asleep, and we could see them sleeping in bed from our room down the hall because they had the door open. We even heard our dad snoring, so it wasn't him. Santa Claus stood up straight, turned around, looked right at us, and with a twinkle in his eye, went 'shhhh' 🤫. He disintegrated into that fine, shimmering gold dust as he did that gesture. That was when we screamed bloody murder, ran into our parents' room, and woke them up.

My dad saw how terrified we were and ran into the living room. The door was open. Eerily enough, wet snow was on the living room floor and fine gold glitter everywhere. There were footprints in the snow. My dad, suspecting my uncle was playing a trick on us, angrily called him on the phone and demanded to know why he would do such a thing to scare us. My dad's phone call woke my uncle up; he was still asleep at his house. He had no idea what my dad was talking about.

My parents called the cops and everything. I still remember the red and blue lights flooding our living room when they filed a police report. The cops didn't take my sister and me seriously until my dad showed them the snow on the ground, the footprints, and the weird gold glitter all over the room.

I'm 32 now, and my sister is 34, and we still remember the morning we saw Santa Claus. It was downright chilling, and I can't believe that happened to us. Nothing this overtly paranormal has ever happened to me since then.""

16.""I used to have weird and creepy experiences at home when I was a kid. It was across the street from an open field with a church on the far right of the lot. It was a big church with a loud bell that you would hear every day at noon. It had an energy that I can't explain as an adult. When I was little, my bed was along the far wall in the room. Depending on which way I was facing, I would be looking at the wall or down the hallway all the way to the other side of the house. I remember constantly forcing myself to face the wall because I often saw a figure at the other side of the house in the middle of the night. It was tall, masculine, had red eyes, and wore a top hat. I swear to god. No features could be made out other than the bright red eyes and the shape of the top hat.""

""It would never enter my room or make a sound. It would just stand at the other side of the house and slowly make its way down the hallway until it stopped at my door. I could feel it staring at me even when I wasn't facing the door. I remember many nights just lying in bed facing the white wall in my room, waiting until I was too tired to stay awake.

There were other times when I remember hearing family members calling out from throughout the house or basement when they weren't there. They were always saying 'help!' or 'come here!' I was told to never listen unless they responded, which they never did, or at least I don't remember. My sisters and mom said they heard the same thing as adults.

My parents divorced when I wasn't much older, so I never got to investigate it. The whole family talks about it now, as we're all older and have all had strange experiences. But those weird memories never left, and thinking back as a 28-year-old, they still give me the chills.""

—SlippyMcDibbons

17.""When I was around 4 years old, I remember looking out of my bedroom window and seeing cars driving through our side yard. Instead of looking like our yard, it looked like an actual road, and the cars looked old-fashioned, like they were from the 1940s (this was in the 1970s). Our house was in a plan of homes with pretty large lots, and the through street ran in a completely different area. Naturally, I was frightened by what I saw and ran to tell my mother and older sister. They dismissed it and said I was either dreaming or making things up. I guess I can't really blame them for that. My sister occasionally would tease me about it over the years, and for some reason, every time I was in that part of the yard, I would get a creepy feeling that I shouldn't be there.""

""I must have been about 12 or 13, and my grandmother was visiting. She told my sister and me that when she was a young girl, our neighborhood was part of a farm, and the main road used to run right through our side yard. The road was moved when the farm was broken up into housing lots. My sister and I looked at each other. All I could say was, 'Yes, I know...' Years later, I found aerials and maps online that proved the road was there until the 1940s.""

—Dull-State-2457

18.""One night, when I was a kid, I woke up in the middle of the night. I would leave my bedroom door open as a kid, and my parents' room was to the right of mine, down the hallway. Suddenly, a figure appeared in the dark doorway, and it looked like my mom. I was just looking at her from my bed, confused why she was just standing there. Then out of nowhere, she screamed as loud as she could and stepped back out of my doorway. I remember just lying in bed, freaked out, for a long while before I finally fell back asleep. I've mentioned it to her several times since then, but she knows nothing about it. A few creepy things happened in that house, but that is the one that sticks out the most in my head.""

19.""I didn't see it; I felt it. I was at an ex-friend's house, and she started telling me that she had a demon in the house. I immediately got annoyed because I figured this was just another lie coming out of her mouth. And as I was about to tell her that, something grabbed my ankle. I was immediately pulled from the couch to the floor, and then my friend and I just stared at each other. It made no sense at all. I thought the friend was playing a trick on me, but she was a good 10 feet away from me. And the only other person in the house was in the bathroom. It ended with all three of us leaving the house for a while.""

20.""I live in a decently sized city in western Indiana surrounded by farm land. One evening, as the sun had begun to set, my brother and I were driving back home on the southern side of town, where it turns from your average outlet shopping areas into cornfields. It had started to get dark enough that the car's headlights turned on, but you could still see the scenery fairly well. We approached the crossroad that we lived on and started to turn right. As we turned, the headlights illuminated this tall humanoid creature resembling a deer standing on its hind legs, full-on sprinting away into the cornfield. The stalks were only about shin height at the time, so I could see it for maybe three seconds. Judging by the distance it travelled across the field in that time, it had to have been moving faster than any regular person could run.""

""Immediately, I was disturbed by what I had seen, but I thought it was just some sort of trick of the light. I didn't say anything. My brother, however, confirmed my fears by asking if I had just witnessed what he had. Every time I see the field, I'm reminded of whatever it was. The worst part is knowing it was less than a few hundred feet from my house.""

—Nurkk

21.""When my son was 2 years old, we lived in a house with interior doors (living room, dining room, kitchen, etc.). The doors also had handles rather than knobs. My son was napping, and I was sitting at my desk in the living room with the door closed. The desk was directly next to the door. While sitting there, I watched the door handle completely depress, as if someone was about to open it. Then the handle went back up, slowly, and the door never opened. I figured my son was being cheeky, and got up to open the door myself. No one was on the other side. I checked on my son immediately, and he was sound asleep in bed. His room was on the opposite end of the house and on a different floor.""

—timewasty

22.""I was 20 years old and lived at home with my parents. I woke up one night to see what I thought was my dad sitting on a chair at the foot of the bed. He was facing me, but I couldn't make out any features as it was dark. I said, 'What are you doing?' and got no response. I got up and walked past this figure, who was still sitting and looking at the bed. I was about six feet away from it when I turned on the light, and then he faded away. Yep, I haven't slept in darkness for the last 20 years, and if a chair is in the room, I have to turn it away from the bed.""

—Kindly_Tutor_5320

23.And: ""My husband left to run errands, so I started cleaning the house while he was gone. I was washing dishes at the sink and saw him walk down the hall. I asked if he forgot something, but he didn't answer. I watched him walk into our son's room and followed him to see what was happening. When I walked into the room, no one was there. That was over 10 years ago, and I still can't make sense of it.""

As a middle-aged nerd, I sometimes find myself referring to the movies of my childhood and being surprised by how weird they are by modern standards of political correctness. At the same time, some of these films retain the quality and charisma that won over the audiences of yesteryear, and I'm fine looking at them as entertaining products of their time. That's why I think you should watch Weird Science on Netflix, a raunchy ‘80s classic from legendary director John Hughes that is sure to become your new problematic fave.

The plot of Weird Science is that two teenage nerds who can't land a girlfriend decide to do the next best thing: to use a computer and create their own floppy disk Frankenstein of a woman. The insane plan works better than they could have ever hoped, and they bring a dream woman to life who can magically create everything from fake IDs to a sweet convertible. But the more they fall in love with their digital hottie, the less likely it becomes that these geeky teens will connect with the real world.

The cast of Weird Science is small but filled with big names, starting with Anthony Michael Hall (an ‘80s icon thanks to movies like The Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles) playing one of our unlucky-in-love teen protagonists. His partner in crime is Ilan Mitchell-Smith, who is best known outside of this movie for his role in the Superboy television show. Meanwhile, his character's grumpy older brother is played by Bill Paxton, the iconic actor sci-fi fans know best from his performance in Aliens (“game over, man, game over!”).

Speaking of horror fans, they will be delighted to see Michael Berryman, the wide-eyed star of The Hills Have Eyes, in Weird Science. He is joined by fellow genre performer Vernon Wells, whose character is deliberately designed to resemble the actor's memorable character in Mad Max 2. The most surprising performer in this movie, though, is Marvel icon Robert Downey Jr., looking absolutely babyfaced in this iconic ‘80s film.

The movie is undeniably of its time, and when rewatching it, I couldn't help but think how strange it would be if Weird Science were made today. Mainstream critics would likely decry our two main characters as terminally online incels, and everyone would make fun of their efforts to bring a glorified chatbot to life. In the ‘80s, this film worked because it smashed two basic concepts together: nerdy teens (a staple of countless films of the decade) and computers (which, at the time, truly seemed like they could do anything).

While critics thought this was one of John Hughes' weaker teen comedies, Weird Science still has a 60 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, certifying this exemplar of sci-fi silliness as “fresh.” Audiences, amusingly enough, gave the film a score of 69 percent, which I'm pretty sure our teen main characters would have found amusing (maybe they'd give us a Bill and Ted-esque line delivery of “69, dude!”).

Back in 1985, audiences voted with their dollars in a big way, helping Weird Science earn $38.9 million against a budget of only $7.5 million. That's why we eventually got a surprisingly solid TV show adaptation in 1994.

Will you find Weird Science to be your new problematic fave, or is this one chaotic computer invention you'll want to put into your desktop's recycle bin? You won't find out until you stream it for yourself, returning to a simpler time of streamlined cinematic storytelling. Afterward, I'm confident you'll fall in love with a quirky comedy that could very well have gone by a different name: two guys, a girl, and a PC place.","{'href': 'https://www.yahoo.com', 'title': 'yahoo.com'}","other"

SAN ANTONIO — A non profit organization continued its efforts to locate a missing San Antonio woman on Sunday, leading a search in a wooded area near, where she was last seen.

Search and Support San Antonio, organized the operation in hopes of uncovering new evidence in the disappearance of Katelyn ""Kate"" Vara, who vanished more than a year ago.

“This is actually the second time we've come out to this area,” Eric Herr, VP Search & Support San Antonio said.

Vara was 26, when she was last seen on August 6, 2024. 

According to her family, she left her home on Maria Elena Drive, near Culebra Road, to attend a medical appointment. She made it to the appointment, but never returned home, leaving behind her young son.

San Antonio police say someone called 911 from Vara's phone at a Northeast-side motel, but the caller hung up. 

Officers responding to the scene spoke with witnesses who claimed Vara had been assaulted, though no evidence was found at the motel.

Joining Sunday's search was psychic medium Vic Andrea, who has been working with Vara's mother, Valerie Mendoza, since February.

“She is simply looking to gain closure,” Andrea said.

Andrea claims she receives visions and impressions from conversations with family members, which help identify potential “hot spots” for search efforts.

""Based off those notes, I get visions, signs, and feelings. That leads me to specific areas, what I would call a hot spot."" Andrea said.

Andrea's guidance led volunteers to the location on Sunday. Eric Herr, a team lead with Search and Support San Antonio, said the information from the psychic had similarities to information police had received but had not made public.

“We had a psychic who gave us some information, and it actually was corroborated by the police,” Herr said. “It was almost the same information that the police had not released.”

The exact location of Sunday's search is being withheld due to the ongoing nature of the police investigation. However, Herr said searchers focused on a two-mile radius in a wooded area.

“We're still very interested in this area,” Herr said. “We're looking for any information, any articles of clothing, any signs that she was here. She was in a location not too far from here the day she disappeared.”

Vara's case remains an active investigation by the San Antonio Police Department.

Andrea, the psychic medium, previously assisted a caregiver, and authorities in finding a missing elderly man, in January of this year.

""Charlie Kirk worked tirelessly against the movement on behalf of Israel. What did it get him? A bullet, because Jews are radicalized people in America and across Europe.""

""Pretty obvious that Israel ordered the hit after Charlie started noticing.""

""He was their friend. He basically dedicated his life to them. And they murdered him in front of his family. Israel just shot itself.""

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has just published a report showing a sharp surge in antisemitic conspiracy theories online following the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk. Almost immediately, while the manhunt was still underway and no suspect had been identified, antisemites flooded social media with conspiracy theories and claims blaming Israel for the assassination or targeting Jews in general. Within two days of Kirk's shooting, more than 10,000 posts on X had appeared blaming Israel for his death.

Throughout history, a strong indicator of societal collapse is when Jews become the target and scapegoat during times of crisis or social unrest. After Tsar Alexander II was assassinated in 1881, pogroms broke out across the Russian Empire. During the Black Plague, Jews were falsely accused of poisoning the wells, which led to violent attacks, massacres, and expulsions in many European cities. During political instability in France, a Jewish army officer, Alfred Dreyfus, was falsely accused of treason in what became known as the Dreyfus Affair, sparking a wave of antisemitic hysteria across the country. And in Germany, as the economy collapsed after World War I, people latched onto the rumor that Jews controlled the banks, a lie that laid the groundwork for the antisemitism that eventually fueled the Holocaust. Similarly, during the coronavirus pandemic, uncertainty and fear allowed conspiracy theories to spread online, showing the same pattern of scapegoating and targeting of Jewish communities during times of crisis.

Unfortunately, the same antisemitism is now driving online discourse around Kirk's murder, with many claiming that his criticism of Israel and opposition to American involvement in a potential war with Iran were motives for his killing. Notorious antisemitic American political commentator Jackson Hinkle has amplified these false claims, maintaining a running list titled ""EVERY ISRAELI connection to Charlie Kirk's ASSASSINATION (so far),"" which escalates from Kirk mildly criticizing Israel to absurd assertions that he said Epstein was Mossad or opposed an Iran war – each entry framing Jews and Israel as responsible for his death.

Hinckle is one of many figures promoting ""false flag"" conspiracy theories suggesting that Israel politically orchestrated Kirk's murder. The ADL report even shows that some posts blame American Jewish organizations for orchestrating Kirk's murder because he had become more critical of Israel or because they feared that Kirk would ""turn on them.""

While it is true that Kirk received backlash from some Jewish communities for hosting Tucker Carlson at the Turning Point USA conference and for moderating a debate between comedian Dave Smith and Josh Hammer, a pro-Israel conservative and senior editor at Newsweek, those citing these events as motives for his murder offer no evidence whatsoever.

Other fueling conspiracy theories suggest that Israel and the US government worked together to have Kirk assassinated the day before the anniversary of September 11 to fuel hate against Muslim people.

We now know that Charlie's murderer is suspected to be 22-year-old Tyler James Robinson, who was arrested two days later after being identified through surveillance footage and tips from his family. Police are still unclear about his motives, but at a time when political violence is surging, Jewish communities are becoming more of a target, and allowing these conspiracy theories to fester online is putting Jews in danger. We have seen time and time again that, especially when it comes to antisemitism, what starts online will never just stay there.

The truth is that while Charlie Kirk was a controversial figure, to many American Jews and Israelis, he was a source of comfort during a dark period. After Hamas massacred 1,200 Jews during the October 7 attacks, Jewish communities around the world felt abandoned and isolated. While I did not agree with Kirk's stance on many issues, seeing someone outside the Jewish community who could fiercely challenge some of the most prominent antisemites and critics of Israel with such conviction was a powerful sign that we were not alone.

Antisemites and those who thrive on spreading hate will try to exploit Kirk's death for their agenda, but for the average person, even those who disagreed with him politically, his murder was an attack on humanity and a stark reminder of the urgent need to confront violence, intolerance, and the destructive power of hatred.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Elon Musk, Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg are worth about as much as one of America's largest companies.","https://www.businessinsider.com/musk-ellison-zuck-buffett-berkshire-stock-tech-ai-trillion-wealth-2025-9","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 13:09:00 GMT","

The three wealthiest people on the planet are worth a combined $1 trillion, or about as much as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg had net worths of $419 billion, $349 billion, and $265 billion as of Friday's close, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Together, they're worth $1.03 trillion, rivaling Berkshire's $1.07 billion market capitalization and comfortably surpassing the $800 billion-plus market values of JPMorgan, Walmart, and Oracle.

It's striking that three individuals are worth almost as much on paper as Berkshire, a corporate behemoth that generates around $370 billion in annual revenue, employs nearly 400,000 workers, and has arguably the world's greatest living investor at its helm.

Musk, Ellison, and Zuckerberg are worth so much because they're the biggest shareholders of some of the world's most valuable companies. Musk owns about 13% of Tesla and 42% of SpaceX, Ellison holds about a 41% stake in Oracle, and Zuckerberg has around a 13% stake in Meta.

The trio clear the $1 trillion mark because they've hugely increased their wealth as a group. While Musk's fortune has shrunk by $14 billion this year to date, Ellison's net worth has nearly doubled, surging by $157 billion as Oracle stock has soared over 75% since January 1. Moreover, Zuckerberg's wealth has jumped by $58 billion, fueled by Meta stock's 29% gain in 2025.

Most ultrawealthy people have also grown substantially richer this year. The 17 members of the $100 billion club have added a net $434 billion to their joint fortunes this year, boosting their combined wealth to $3.2 trillion at Friday's close — a figure greater than the market values of Alphabet or Amazon.

Musk, Ellison, and Zuckerberg have seen their fortunes balloon in recent years thanks to investor optimism around AI's potential to slash corporations' costs and supercharge their profitability.

Oracle's stock price climbed as much as 43% last Wednesday alone, lifting the company's market value by nearly $300 billion at its peak, after it projected rapid revenue growth fueled by AI demand.

Musk could become the world's first trillionaire with the help of a prospective Tesla pay package unveiled last week. The proposed deal would grant Musk shares worth over $1 trillion if he manages to increase his company's market value by around eightfold and hit a slew of operational targets within the next decade or so. 

Musk purchased around $1 billion worth of Tesla stock on Friday, signaling he likes his chances.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Netanyahu admits Israel faces prolonged ‘isolation' over Gaza war","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/15/middleeast/netanyahu-israel-isolation-intl","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 16:50:55 GMT","


            With global anger mounting over the nearly two-year war in Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Monday that Israel is facing a “kind of isolation” that could last for years, and has no choice but to stand on its own.
    


            Speaking at a finance ministry conference, Netanyahu said Israel's economy would need to adapt to “autarkic characteristics” – becoming more self-sufficient and less reliant on external trade.
    


            “It's a word I hate,” Netanyahu said, adding that it was he who had brought a “free-market revolution to Israel.”
    


            One of the key industries facing isolation is weapons trade, he said, which may force Israel to avoid reliance on foreign arms imports.
    


            “We'll need to develop our weapons industry - we're going to be Athens and super Sparta combined. We have no choice, at least for the coming years when we'll be required to deal with these isolation attempts,” he said.
    


            Netanyahu's statements mark a rare acknowledgement of the massive international backlash Israel faces as it escalates its war in Gaza. He has refused to change course, despite warnings from the United Nations and others that a looming assault on Gaza City will lead to more death and destruction, and amid mounting accusations that Israel is committing genocide in the enclave, which Israel strongly denies.
    


            Israel now faces partial or complete arms embargoes from France, the Netherlands, the UK, Spain, Italy and others due to its conduct in the Gaza war. The majority of its weapons imports however, come from the United States, which hasn't placed any such restrictions – and has warned others from doing so. A Biden-era delay on a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs was quickly lifted by the Trump administration.
    


            The Israeli public, hostage families, and even the military have opposed expanding the war over concerns it could endanger the hostages and worsen the humanitarian toll. But the prime minister has insisted on pressing ahead.
    


            For years, Israel has been considered an economic powerhouse regionally and globally, driven in large part by its vaunted high-tech industry. But the war has had an economic impact and is already the longest and most expensive in the country's history.
    


            Netanyahu partly attributed the isolation to “an extreme Islamist agenda” which he claimed had a “very negative influence” on European foreign policy. He also said rival states – “among them Qatar” – have shaped global discourse on social media, which “puts us into a kind of isolation.”
    


            “This situation threatens us with the beginnings of economic sanctions and problems importing weapons and weapon parts,” Netanyahu said.
    


            ‘There will be no second chance'
    


            Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid slammed Netanyahu in response, dubbing his statement that Israel is entering isolation as “crazy.”
    


            “Isolation is not fate; it is the result of Netanyahu's flawed and failed policy,” Lapid wrote on X.
    


            Gadi Eisenkot, the former Israeli military chief planning a political run, also blasted the prime minister, saying, “There will be no second chance to repair the damage caused by him and his partners who abandoned the hostages and isolated Israel in the world.”
    


            Later on Monday, Netanyahu addressed the “pessimists” about the economy, saying Israel's stock market is the “strongest in the world.”
    


            “Investing in Israel is the smart thing to do,” he said in a statement, adding that Israel would continue to increase investments in weapons production to avoid dependence on “weak Western European leaders who surrender to extreme Muslim minorities in their countries.”
    


            Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich appeared to echo the prime minister's statement, posting to X that the stock market is rising, inflation is falling, and commending the country's management of the economy amid the war in Gaza.
    


            Earlier Monday, Netanyahu spoke alongside US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who lavished praise on “the friendship that Israel has shown towards the United States on so many issues we've worked on together that extend beyond the causes of war and peace.”
    


            The two criticized a number of countries, including France, Canada, Australia and others that are set to recognize a Palestinian state ahead of the United Nations General Assembly this month.

Canada's main stock index was flat on Monday, as investors stayed cautious ahead of key policy decisions from both the Bank of Canada and the U.S. Federal Reserve.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index was up 0.06 per cent at 29,201.96 points.

Bank of Canada and U.S. Fed expected to resume rate cuts this week

Economists anticipate the BoC will cut its overnight rate by a quarter point on September 17, as the labour market deteriorates and economic activity weakens. They also expect one more cut in the next quarter. 

Canada's central bank has faced growing pressure to resume easing after holding rates steady since March following a cumulative 225-basis-point reduction - one of the most aggressive among the country's G10 peers.

Meanwhile, the U.S. central bank's rate decision will take center stage, with investors largely expecting a 25-basis-point cut on Wednesday after a series of economic indicators pointed to a worsening jobs market in the world's biggest economy.

Investors are cautious before the two central banks' meetings, said Allan Small, senior investment adviser of the Allan Small Financial Group with iA Private Wealth.

“Markets price in well in advance what the Fed or Bank of Canada is more than likely to do and unless there's a surprise either way, you're probably going to see a muted response.”

On Monday, the probability of a 25-basis-point interest rate cut by the Canadian central bank stood at 95.5 per cent, according to data compiled by LSEG.

“It's a pretty much a done deal,” added Small.

Several other central banks will also announce their policy decisions this week, including those in the UK and Japan.

On the TSX, consumer staples stocks slipped 1.4 per cent, while an index of communication stocks fell 1.2 per cent.

Among individual stocks, B2Gold fell 3.5 per cent after the Canadian miner provided an update on Goose Mine commissioning and confirmed its consolidated 2025 production guidance range.

Parex Resources posted the biggest percentage gain on the TSX, up 5.3 per cent, after BMO upgraded the stock to “outperform” from “market perform”. 

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq hit intraday record highs on Monday, beginning the week with the Federal Reserve's policy meeting on a strong note, while Tesla shares gained following CEO Elon Musk's stock purchase.

The electric vehicle maker jumped 5.8 per cent to its highest level since late January after regulatory filings revealed Musk had acquired nearly $1 billion worth of Tesla's stock on Friday.

This week, the Fed's rate decision will take center stage, with investors largely expecting a 25-basis-point cut on Wednesday following a series of economic indicators that pointed to a deteriorating jobs market.

Traders are pricing in a total of 68.9 points in monetary policy easing by end-2025, data compiled by LSEG showed.

“Everyone is anticipating at least one (25 bps) cut, some people are thinking 50 bps. That's overreaching, but the market is certainly built for one,” said Joe Saluzzi, co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading.

“Anything less than that (25 bps) would be a severe disappointment and we'd have a very, very sharp sell-off.”

Tesla's gains boosted the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector 1.4 per cent to its highest level in nearly nine months.

The communication services sector was 1.8 per cent higher on a boost by Google-parent Alphabet, which hit $3 trillion in market capitalization for the first time.

Conversely, Nvidia's 1.1 per cent decline weighed on the tech sector. China's market regulator said it will continue an investigation into the AI chip leader after preliminary findings showed it had violated the country's anti-monopoly law.

Other U.S. chipmakers that faced pressure after China launched an anti-discrimination investigation into U.S. chip trade policies and a separate probe into dumping practices, pared earlier declines.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 20.02 points, or 0.04 per cent, to 45,854.24, the S&P 500 gained 23.54 points, or 0.36 per cent, to 6,607.83 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 123.71 points, or 0.56 per cent, to 22,264.81.

Declines in UnitedHealth and Home Depot limited gains on the Dow.

Wall Street's three main indexes had logged weekly gains in the previous session, with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 hitting intraday record highs on Friday as technology-linked stocks remained resilient.

The major indexes have performed positively thus far in September, a month considered historically bad for U.S. equities. The benchmark S&P 500 has shed 1.5 per cent on average in the month since 2000, data compiled by LSEG showed.

Among the final datasets before the Fed's September 16-17 meeting, Tuesday's retail sales report will provide crucial insights into the U.S. consumer's health, following a slightly hotter-than-expected inflation reading last week.

Intel gained 4.6 per cent after the chipmaker trimmed its full-year expense outlook.

CoreWeave jumped 7.7 per cent after the data center operator signed

a deal

with Nvidia that guarantees that the chipmaker will purchase any residual cloud capacity not sold to customers. The deal's initial value is $6.3 billion.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.16-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.53-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 51 new highs and 16 new lows.

A Washington Post columnist has been fired after posting about the death of Charlie Kirk and “white men who espouse hatred”.

Karen Attiah claimed bosses at the newspaper deemed her comments on Bluesky, a social media platform popular with Left-wingers, “unacceptable”.

Ms Attiah, 39, the last full-time black op-ed writer at the Post, wrote on the platform: “Part of what keeps America so violent is the insistence that people perform care, empty goodness and absolution for white men who espouse hatred and violence.”

In another post, she said: “Refusing to tear my clothes and smear ashes on my face in performative mourning for a white man that espoused violence is… not the same as violence.”

“America, especially white America, is not going to do what it needs to do to get rid of guns in their country,” Ms Attiah wrote in another.

She only referenced Kirk by name in one post, quoting him as saying that “black women do not have the brain processing power to be taken seriously”.

Kirk made the comment when speaking about “affirmative action”, the process of giving university places to under-represented students, which critics say discriminates against white and Asian people.

Speaking on his podcast, The Charlie Kirk Show, he played a video of Sheila Jackson-Lee, a former congresswoman, saying that she “may have been admitted on affirmative action” being a black woman, but that she “did not graduate on affirmative action”.

Kirk said: “If we would have said that Joy Reid and Michelle Obama and Sheila Jackson Lee and Ketanji Brown Jackson were affirmative action picks, we would have been called racists. 

“Now they're coming out and they're saying it for us… You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously. 

“You had to go steal a white person's slot to be taken somewhat seriously.”   

Ms Attiah published the posts in the wake of 31-year-old Kirk's death last week. He was shot in the throat while addressing a crowd of 3,000 at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.

The Turning Point USA co-founder was on the first stop of his American Comeback tour, attending college campuses across the country, where he would host “prove me wrong sessions,” in which he would personally debate students.

In a post on Substack addressing her firing, Ms Attiah claimed her “moral values” prevented her from engaging in “false mourning” for Mr Kirk, whom she said “routinely attacked black women”.

Kirk's staunch views on abortion, trans rights, and same-sex marriage sometimes made him a polarising figure – especially on university campuses.

He has been praised for his willingness to debate and listen to others' opinions, and previously said: “What we have to get back to is being able to have a reasonable disagreement where violence is not an option.”

Ms Attiah's removal comes amid turmoil at the Post with dozens of staff leaving after Jeff Bezos announced in February its comments pages were embracing a more libertarian vision.

That led to David Shipley, the Post's opinions editor whom Mr Bezos recruited from Bloomberg in 2022, quitting, and numerous other journalists departing.

In her post, Ms Attiah, who has written for the Post for more than a decade, included an image of herself holding a burning copy of the newspaper and with a rose in her mouth.

The caption alluded to the Post's official slogan and read: “Democracy dies in darkness, but some of us will still carry on the light.”

She said: “As a columnist, I used my voice to defend freedom and democracy, challenge power, and reflect on culture and politics with honesty and conviction.

“Now, I am the one being silenced – for doing my job.”

She claimed the Post accused her Bluesky posts of being “gross misconduct” and of endangering her colleagues.

“Charges without evidence, which I reject completely as false,” Ms Attiah said.

“They rushed to fire me without even a conversation. This was not only a hasty overreach, but a violation of the very standards of journalistic fairness and rigour the Post claims to uphold.”

“I did my journalistic duty, reminding people that despite President Trump's partisan rushes to judgment, no suspect or motive had been identified in the killing of Charlie Kirk – exercising restraint even as I condemned hatred and violence,” she said.

“My journalistic and moral values for balance compelled me to condemn violence and murder without engaging in excessive, false mourning for a man who routinely attacked black women as a group, put academics in danger by putting them on watch lists (and) claimed falsely that black people were better off in the era of Jim Crow.”

Ms Attiah told her followers that they could support her by attending her “Resistance Summer School”, a graduate-level course she used to teach at Columbia University about the intersection of race, media, and international affairs.

The Telegraph has contacted the Washington Post for comment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Why you can't pee and what to do about it","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/15/health/cant-pee-what-it-means-wellness","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 17:35:24 GMT","


    Dr. Jamin Brahmbhatt is a urologist and robotic surgeon with Orlando Health and an assistant professor at the University of Central Florida's College of Medicine.



            The day after I had kidney stone surgery, I suddenly couldn't pee. My bladder felt full, but nothing was coming out. I'm a urologist and even I was freaking out: I felt stuck, panicked and helpless. After what felt like five hours — but was really only five minutes — the urine started to flow.
    


            Once I remembered I'm a urologist, I realized the problem wasn't just my bladder. The problem was constipation from all the medications I had to take the day before surgery. Once that issue was sorted out, my bladder finally relaxed — and the urine flowed just fine.
    


            My case was situational and temporary, and it could be for you, too. But for many people, difficulty urinating is a real quality-of-life issue that won't go away easily.
    


            The problem could be urinary retention, when your bladder is full but can't empty. Or your bladder may be empty but you still feel the urge to go. Either way, the experience is the same — you're trying to pee and nothing's coming out.
    


            To understand why, I'll go over some basic anatomy. Made of muscle fibers, the bladder is a balloon-like structure in the lower abdomen that holds urine. At the bottom is a narrow region called the bladder neck, which opens into the urethra – the tube that carries urine out of the body. In men, the urethra runs through the prostate before reaching the penis; in women, it's shorter and exits just in front of the vagina.
    


            For urine to flow, the bladder muscle must contract or squeeze while the outlet and urethra relax. If anything interferes with this process — a blockage, weak bladder muscles or poor nerve signals — the urine is unable to flow.
    


            This issue is most common in men older than 50, but women and younger people can experience it too, especially if medications or other health conditions are involved.
    


            In men, the most common cause is an enlarged prostate blocking the flow of urine. In fact, studies show that after age 70, about 1 in 10 men will have developed acute urinary retention within five years, and by the time they reach their 80s, that number rises to nearly 1 in 3.
    


What your peeing frequency can say about your health



            In women, nerve issues or a cystocele (a type of pelvic organ prolapse, or dropped bladder) can alter flow, but acute urinary retention is much less common, affecting only about 3 in 100,000 women each year.  Sorry, guys, this problem is more common in you, thanks to the prostate and longer urethra!
    


            This is not just a condition of being old. Many cases, like mine, come down to something more everyday: constipation. When the bowels back up, they can physically change the angle of the bladder neck, essentially kinking the outlet.
    


            Medications are another significant factor. Think about the pills you might take for allergies or a cold — decongestants and antihistamines are known to slow or even stop urine flow. Some antidepressants, bladder medications and pain pills can have the same effect.
    


            Other causes may include urinary stones, strictures, blood clots and infections that can block the outlet. For those with a neurologic condition such as multiple sclerosis, diabetes, a spinal cord injury or stroke, the nerves that control bladder emptying can be damaged.



            Not all trouble urinating looks the same. A weak stream or stop-and-start flow is one thing — bothersome, but often gradual and not immediately dangerous.
    


            If you cannot urinate at all and your bladder feels painfully full, your belly feels swollen, you've tried to relax, you've had a bowel movement and still nothing comes out — that's likely an emergency. Go to the ER right away. You may need to have your bladder drained with a catheter to relieve the pressure, empty your bladder and prevent kidney damage.
    


            Some people have no symptoms at all. In our urology office, we'll do an ultrasound scan of the bladder and find hundreds of milliliters of urine still inside. This “silent” retention can be just as risky over time, leading to infections or long-term bladder problems if left untreated.
    


            In one hospital-based study of male patients, approximately half presented with acute retention, while about 30% were found to have chronic retention. That's why it's important to have routine checkups with your primary care doctor and tell them about any symptoms you may have — sometimes your bladder can be in trouble even if you feel fine.
    


            The first step is determining whether the issue is proper retention — your bladder is full but can't empty — or simply having the sensation that you need to go but your bladder is already empty. Those two situations may seem the same, but the treatment is quite different. That's why we review your medical history and get new, objective data. For example, we check how much urine is left in the bladder after you try to void, test urine and blood for infections, and look at kidney function.
    


Stress doesn't just affect your bladder. It can hijack your overall health



            We also have tools that eliminate some of the guesswork. A uroflow machine can measure the strength and pattern of your urine stream. And, if needed, we can put a small camera (cystoscopy) into the urethra and bladder to see what might be blocking the flow.
    


            Just this week, I saw a young man who was having significant trouble urinating — rare for his age. A quick look with the scope showed a urethral stricture, or scar tissue, that was obstructing the flow of urine. As urologists, we see similar issues all the time: Sometimes it's scar tissue, other times a large prostate pressing on the urethra. In women it could be a dropped bladder. Different causes, same results — urinary flow is blocked, and the bladder cannot empty properly.
    


            In rare, acute cases — when someone is in severe pain and unable to urinate at all — we immediately insert a catheter to drain the bladder. More commonly, however, patients have minor, bothersome symptoms that creep up over time. When caught early, many of these problems can be improved or even fixed before they turn into emergencies.
    


            Pay attention to subtle changes, such as a weaker stream, straining or frequent nighttime trips to the bathroom. Don't brush these off as just getting older. Review your medication list with your doctor and stay hydrated. Most importantly, don't ignore constipation — it doesn't just affect your gut; it can affect your urination, too.
    


Here's why you keep waking up to pee in the middle of the night



            Keep an eye on your bathroom habits the way you would your blood pressure or weight. Small changes addressed early can make a big difference.
    


            Talking about not being able to pee can feel embarrassing or awkward, but it's important that you tell your doctor if it's happening to you. After all, having this problem is your body's way of asking for help. I know firsthand how unsettling it can be since I went through it myself.
    


            In my case, the cause was straightforward, and the symptoms cleared up quickly. In other cases, the cause may be more complex. This is when a doctor can help determine whether the issue is a blockage, a nerve problem, a side effect of medication or something else entirely. Whether the fix is as simple as changing a medication or as involved as having a medical procedure to open the prostate channel, getting checked early makes all the difference.
    


            That's why I shared my story — it was embarrassing even for me, but I hope it will help you avoid the same issue. Don't ignore the symptoms if you have them. Just get checked.

Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor involved in the Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell and Sean Combs cases, has sued the Trump administration over her firing this summer, levying another legal challenge to the Justice Department's treatment of career officials.
    


            Comey, the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, alleges in a lawsuit filed Monday in federal court in Manhattan that she was not given any explanation for her termination and says it was done in retaliation for being her father's daughter.
    


            “Ms. Comey's termination – without cause, without advance notice, and without any opportunity to contest it – was unlawful and unconstitutional,” according to the lawsuit. “In truth, there is no legitimate explanation. Rather, Defendants fired Ms. Comey solely or substantially because her father is former FBI Director James B. Comey, or because of her perceived political affiliation and beliefs, or both,” the lawsuit alleges.
    


            Comey is one of several federal civil servants fired by the Trump administration who have filed lawsuits to reinstate their positions or seek pay in a challenge to the administration's sweeping removal of FBI agents and other federal prosecutors without notice or conforming to legal procedures.
    


            The Justice Department and US Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York declined to comment.
    


            Comey was notified by email just before 5 p.m. on July 16 that she had been removed from her position “pursuant to Article II of the United States Constitution,” according to the lawsuit.
    


            She said no reason was given for her termination following a near decade of positive performance reviews and promotions.
    


Maurene Comey, fired by Trump DOJ, says ‘fear is the tool of the tyrant' in memo to her former colleagues



            Jay Clayton, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, told Comey, according to the lawsuit, “All I can say is it came from Washington. I can't tell you anything else.”
    


            At the time of her firing CNN reported a person familiar with the situation said being a Comey is untenable in this administration given her father James Comey is “constantly going after the administration.”
    


            Comey joined the US attorney's office in November 2015 and rose through the ranks becoming chiefs of several units, but ultimately asked to rejoin her colleagues so she could get back into the courtroom.
    


What it was like inside the courtroom during the Sean ‘Diddy' Combs trial



            Her final trial was the prosecution of Sean “Diddy” Combs, who was convicted in July of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. He was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and two counts of sex trafficking. She led the questioning of several key witnesses, including of Combs' former girlfriend who testified under the pseudonym Jane.
    


            In addition to investigating and prosecuting Epstein and Maxwell, Comey also prosecuted gynecologist Robert Hadden for sexually abusing patients.
    


            Comey was fired the day after she was asked to take the lead on a “major public corruption case,” according to her lawsuit.

US President Donald Trump has not ruled out striking mainland Venezuela, accusing the country of sending gang members and drugs into America.

The comments come after weeks of escalating tensions between the two countries. Washington has deployed three warships and about 4,000 troops to the Southern Caribbean, saying the mission targets drug cartels. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro insists his country has already dismantled trafficking networks on its territory.

Speaking to reporters in Morristown, New Jersey, on Sunday, Trump was asked about the possibility of launching a strike on Venezuela and whether he feared escalation from Maduro.

”We'll see what happens,” he said. “Look, Venezuela is sending us their gang members, their drug dealers, and drugs. It's not acceptable.”

Maduro insists his government has eliminated all major trafficking networks and vanquished prominent gangs. Speaking to RT on Thursday, the Venezuelan leader said Washington is using the fight against drug traffickers as a pretext for gaining access to the country's vast natural resources. According to Maduro, these actions fit into a broader “war plan” aimed at subjugating the world to the will of the US.

Relations between the two countries have been tense for years. Washington refused to recognize Maduro's reelection in 2018 and imposed sweeping sanctions while backing the opposition.

Recently, military frictions intensified with the US sinking a Venezuelan boat, claiming it was carrying members of the Tren de Aragua gang. After the incident, two Venezuelan jets conducted a flyover of a US warship. Trump has said Venezuelan planes could be shot down if they pose a threat to American vessels.

Last month, Caracas mobilized 15,000 troops near Colombia and later raised the number to 25,000 in border and coastal states described as “drug trafficking routes.”

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova earlier warned that the situation is being “unacceptably escalated” around Venezuela, with potentially far-reaching ramifications for regional and global security.

MOSCOW, September 15. /TASS/. The European Union is veering down a troubling path of restrictive practices, with countries encircling themselves in ""barbed wire"" and repeatedly imposing bans on their own citizens, according to Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova.

""It is astonishing how the European Union is now following the very worst practices they once warned us against - reminiscent of the Soviet system,"" Zakharova remarked. ""Suddenly, they have surrounded themselves with barbed wire, constantly restricting their own citizens from certain freedoms.""

She further emphasized that such measures fundamentally undermine the principles of the OSCE and the European Union's own commitments to free movement. ""All that remains are empty words. I believe soon there will be nothing left to say.""

Zakharova highlighted the barriers Poland has erected for Russian and Belarusian citizens seeking to visit the EU. ""Look at the numerous obstacles Poland has placed in the way of Belarusian and Russian visitors - denying visas and provoking incidents,"" she noted.

In contrast, Zakharova pointed to Belarus's openness.

""Belarus has always welcomed Polish citizens,"" she said. ""I personally experienced this when I visited last year to commemorate Victory Day. I traveled around Belarus by car, wanting to see Brest and Khatyn with my own eyes - to pay tribute to these places. I encountered Polish license plates and met Poles who had come for tourism, shopping, or leisure. Many came simply because Belarus offers better and more affordable goods.""

She also drew attention to the stark difference between the positive reality on the ground and the negative portrayal in Polish media. ""There is a friendly population eager to build relationships and develop cooperation,"" Zakharova asserted. ""I believe that the disparity between perception and reality has become intolerable for the Polish authorities. They have gone so far as to barricade their borders to prevent their citizens from experiencing the truth firsthand.""

On September 9, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced the closure of Poland's border with Belarus, effective from the night of September 11-12. This measure was implemented in response to the commencement of the Belarusian-Russian military exercises Zapad 2025. The closure applies to both entry and exit, affecting individuals as well as freight transportation by road and rail, and will remain in place ""until further notice.""

The Belarusian Foreign Ministry condemned Warsaw's decision, describing it as unfounded and harmful to ordinary people. Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry urged Poland to reconsider its actions, warning of potential repercussions and calling for the border closure to be reversed as soon as possible.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theguardian.com","Washington Post columnist says she was fired over posts after Charlie Kirk's killing","https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/sep/15/karen-attiah-fired-washington-post-charlie-kirk","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 17:55:00 GMT","

Karen Attiah says she was dropped by newspaper after 11 years for addressing political violence, race and gun control

Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah says she has been fired from the newspaper over social media posts about gun control and race in the aftermath of far right commentator Charlie Kirk's killing.

Attiah, 39, recounted in a Substack post that she had been dropped as a Post columnist after 11 years for “speaking out against political violence, racial double standards, and America's apathy toward guns”.

The Post, she wrote, accused “my measured Bluesky posts of being ‘unacceptable, ‘gross misconduct' and of endangering the physical safety of colleagues – charges without evidence, which I reject completely as false”.

Attiah continued: “They rushed to fire me without even a conversation. This was not only a hasty overreach, but a violation of the very standards of journalistic fairness and rigor the Post claims to uphold.”

The columnist's job was understood to be in jeopardy after she clashed with Post opinion editor Adam O'Neal, formerly of the Economist and the Wall Street Journal, who has reportedly offered buyouts to writers whose work does not fit with the editorial mix of the newspaper owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos.

The Bezos-owned Amazon contributed $1m to the fund for the inauguration of the second presidency of Donald Trump, for whom Kirk was a close ally. And the Post decided to forego endorsing a candidate in the November election won by Trump, a Republican, after the newspaper's editorial board had voted to endorse Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.

In her Substack post, Attiah noted that she “was the last remaining Black full-time opinion columnist” on the paper and blasted that Washington DC, “one of the nation's most diverse regions, … no longer has a paper that reflects the people it serves”.

Attiah said her firing was “part of a broader purge of Black voices from academia, business, government, and media – a historical pattern as dangerous as it is shameful – and tragic”.

The Washington Post is under an editorial mandate for the newspaper's opinion section to focus specifically on supporting and defending “personal liberties and free markets”.

A Washington Post spokesperson declined to comment on personnel matters and pointed to the organization's policies and standards, including a section governing social media use.

In writings on Bluesky, Attiah lamented that the US, in her opinion, “accepts and worships” gun violence.

“My only direct reference to Kirk was one post – his own words on record,” she said in her Substack letter. The letter included a screenshot of a Bluesky post alluding to a 2023 remark from Kirk about how several prominent Black women “do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously.

“You have to go steal a white person's slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.”

Attiah continued that she was pointing “to the familiar pattern of America shrugging off gun deaths and giving compassion for white men who commit and espouse political violence”.

The firing described by Attiah came after the Status media newsletter – citing sources – reported in August that she had refused a buyout offer. It also comes days after MSNBC political analyst Matthew Dowd was dismissed for describing Kirk – in the aftermath of his killing – as a “divisive” figure who pushed “hate speech”.

Some accused Dowd of implicitly justifying the violence against Kirk by having said that “hateful words” lead to “hateful actions”. Dowd has since written his comments were “misconstrued” and MSNBC caved to pressure from a “rightwing media mob”.

Dowd was one of the earliest instances of people across the US either being fired from or disciplined at their jobs amid a coordinated effort to clamp down on commentary that is critical about Kirk.

In August, the Post published an opinion piece by Trump administration official Jay Bhattacharya to argue that the federal health and human services department's decision to cut to support to mRNA vaccine development was a “necessary” step. Experts have warned that the approach is wrongheaded, with mRNA vaccines having saved millions of lives during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The editorial page also published an opinion from Jeanine Pirro, a former host at the conservative Fox News network who is now serving as a Washington DC district attorney, that promoted the administration's decision to deploy national guard troops on the streets of the capital to allegedly make them safer – even though the city's violent crime rate is at 30-year low.

O'Neal reportedly sent a memo on 14 July asserting that his “top priority will be to significantly increase the reach and effect of our work”.

“Advocating for free markets and personal liberties will be critical as we rebuild trust with more Americans and scale our high quality journalism,” the memo reportedly said. It said the changes were “not a partisan project” and the paper “won't let sentimentality slow down much-needed reform”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Key developments on Sept. 15:

Ukrainian forces have cleared Russian troops from the village of Pankivka in the Dobropillia sector of Donetsk Oblast, the National Guard's 1st Azov Corps reported on Sept. 15.

Ukrainian forces have spent the past month pushing Russian troops back after they advanced nearly 10 kilometers (6 miles) toward the strategic Dobropillia–Kramatorsk highway, near the embattled city of Pokrovsk. Since late August, Ukrainian units have regained control of several villages in the area.

The operation to clear the settlement was conducted jointly by units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the National Guard, according to the statement.

Meanwhile, Russian forces continue to reinforce their positions in the area, prompting Ukraine to deploy additional reserves to the sector overseen by the 1st Azov Corps of the National Guard, which comprises four infantry brigades and a marine regiment.

""Ukrainian defense forces are making every effort to halt the enemy's advance and prevent a breach in the defenses,"" the statement read.

Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi has dismissed Volodymyr Silenko and Maksym Kituhin, commanders of the 17th and 20th respective Army Corps, Ukrainska Pravda reported on Sept. 15, citing two unnamed military sources.

These are the first senior personnel changes since President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Feb. 3 that the Ukrainian Armed Forces would transition to a corps-based structure.

Both commanders were reportedly removed one to two weeks ago following battlefield losses in the areas under their command, according to Ukrainska Pravda.

The 17th Corps, led by Silenko, was responsible for the sector of the front line south of Zaporizhzhia, where Ukrainian forces recently lost control of the village of Kamianske and were partially driven out of Plavni, both located along the Dnipro River.

Kituhin's 20th Corps was deployed along the border between Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts, which Russian forces crossed in August, digging into the latter region for the first time.

Ukraine's Brave1 defense innovation cluster has completed the final stage of testing for new kamikaze drones with a range of over 40 kilometers (25 miles), Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov announced on Sept. 15.

The drones are built to withstand Russian electronic warfare systems and will soon be tested in combat.

""Kamikaze attack drones with a range of 40 kilometers, capable of overcoming electronic warfare, represent a new level of capability to attack the enemy,"" Fedorov said.

Electronic warfare has become one of Russia's key defenses against Ukraine's drone arsenal, as jamming and spoofing aim to disrupt navigation and prevent drones from striking targets.

If proven resilient, the new systems could improve Ukraine's ability to strike logistics hubs, artillery positions, and equipment behind Russian lines.

""Strike drones are becoming a cheap and practical solution for the front lines — they are affordable to manufacture and easily scalable,"" Fedorov added.

Starlink, the satellite internet service owned by Elon Musk, suffered a global outage on Sept. 15, the company announced on its official website.

The service has become vital for hospitals, schools, and front-line military units across Ukraine.

""Starlink is once again down across the entire front line,"" Ukraine's top drone warfare commander, Robert ""Madyar"" Brovdi, wrote on Telegram.

Downdetector, a platform that tracks service outages, reported tens of thousands of user complaints worldwide. The company said it was investigating the cause.

Nearly an hour later, Brovdi reported that connectivity was beginning to ""gradually restore,"" though Starlink has not officially confirmed a full recovery. Downdetector also shows a decline in outage reports.

This marks the second major Starlink outage in recent months.

The stakes are high for Ukraine, as Starlink has replaced much of the country's destroyed communications infrastructure and supports both civilian and military connectivity.

Protesters block the road in an attempt to disrupt the twenty-first stage of the Spanish cycling race La Vuelta, on Sunday.Manu Fernandez/The Associated Press

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez on Monday called for Israel to be banned from sports events after pro-Palestinian activists disrupted the final stage of the Spanish Vuelta cycling race in chaotic scenes in Madrid. Israel's foreign minister responded by calling Sánchez an “antisemite and a liar.”

Tensions between the two countries have escalated in recent weeks as Spain's left-wing government expressed support for protesters who interrupted several stages of the Vuelta, including Sunday's final stage in Madrid, because an Israeli team was taking part.

Speaking to members of his Socialist Party, Sánchez said Israel, just like Russia, should not be allowed to compete in international sports events because of its military campaign in Gaza.

“The sports organizations should consider whether it's ethical for Israel to keep participating in international competitions. Why expel Russia after the invasion of Ukraine and not expel Israel after the invasion of Gaza?” Sanchez said. “Until the barbarity ends, neither Russia nor Israel should be in any international competition.”

Vingegaard secures Vuelta title as race stopped by Madrid protests

Sánchez spoke a day after Sunday's final stage of the Vuelta was cut short when pro-Palestinian protesters opposing the participation of Israeli team Israel Premier Tech threw barriers onto the road and clashed with police near the finish line in the Spanish capital. Authorities said two people were arrested and 22 injured, none of them seriously.

The Spanish government had already expressed sympathy with the protesters and suggested that the Israel Premier Tech team should have withdrawn from the three-week-long race that became a diplomatic battleground. 

The team removed its name from its uniforms but remained in the race until the end despite protesters' calls for it to be expelled.

The central government's representative for the Madrid region said an estimated 100,000 people were on the streets during the protests.Bruna Casas/Reuters

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar criticized Sánchez with a post on X that included a video link to the Spanish leader's speech Monday.

“An antisemite and a liar,” Saar wrote. “Did Israel invade Gaza on Oct. 7th or did the Hamas terror state invade Israel and commit the worst massacre against the Jews since the Holocaust?”

The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. There are still 48 hostages remaining in Gaza, of whom Israel believes that 20 are still alive.

Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't say how many were civilians or combatants. The offensive has displaced most of Gaza's 2 million people, caused widespread destruction and severe hunger across the territory.

As the war has ground on, Israel has grown increasingly isolated, with Spain at the forefront of growing list of European countries increasingly critical of Israel due to the heavy civilian toll. A number of countries, including the U.K. and France, have said they plan on recognizing a Palestinian state, and the European Commission's president has called for scaling back Europe's trade ties with Israel.

Anti-Israel protests seize the limelight at the Spanish Vuelta cycling race

Europe remains divided on its stance toward Israel, and its limited sanctions and condemnations so far have had little effect.

Madrid's conservative mayor, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, also criticized Sánchez and described Sunday's events as a sad day for the Spanish capital.

Danish rider Jonas Vingegaard, who was leading the overall classification going into the final stage, was declared the winner of the Vuelta but the customary podium ceremony was cancelled.

“It's a pity that such a moment of eternity was taken from us,” Vingegaard said. “Everyone has the right to protest, but not in a way that influences or endangers our race.”

The teams reportedly improvised a private podium ceremony later so riders could celebrate.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen condemned the protesters for “spoiling” the race and criticized Sanchez for “praising” the protests.

“Instead I want to praise the athletes and everyone who doesn't spoil things for others,” she wrote on Instagram.

Vuelta race director Javier Guillén on Monday defended the decision to let the Israeli team stay in the race.

“The Vuelta's position was clear, we had to abide to the norms of the International Cycling Union. It's the UCI that regulates the right of admission to the race,” Guillén said at a news conference. “We never got into any other type of debate. All we wanted to do was to be able to finish the race with normalcy, and that wasn't possible.”

The UCI on Monday expressed “its total disapproval of and deep concern about the events that marked” the Vuelta. It also said it “strongly condemns the exploitation of sport for political purposes in general, and especially coming from a government.”

“We also regret the fact that the Spanish Prime Minister and his government have supported actions that could hinder the smooth running of a sporting competition and, in some cases, expressed their admiration for the demonstrators.

“This position is contradictory to the Olympic values of unity, mutual respect, and peace. It also calls into question Spain's ability to host major international sporting events, ensuring that they take place in safe conditions and in accordance with the principles of the Olympic Charter.”

The central government's representative for the Madrid region said an estimated 100,000 people were on the streets during the protests. The number could not be independently verified.

Guillén said the Vuelta protests would likely have implications for future sports events with Israeli participants.

“After this Vuelta, the international entities will need to make decisions and cycling will need to have some internal discussions to find solutions,” he said.

Next year's Tour de France begins with a stage in Barcelona.

“Hopefully everything will be solved by then,” he said. “I don't want to speculate with any possibilities. I'm sure Barcelona will have a great Tour de France.”

The Israeli leader said his country must prepare for ""some sort"" of isolation, partly blaming it on Muslims in Europe. Meanwhile, Doctors Without Borders warned of a ""real disaster"" as Gazans head south. DW has more.

Here is a roundup of developments in Israel's war in Gaza and the wider Middle East regionon Monday, September 15:

In the wake of Israel's airstrike on Hamas leaders in Doha, Arab and Muslim leaders called urged ""all possible legal and effective measures to prevent Israel from continuing its actions against the Palestinian people.""

They made the call after an emergency meeting of 57 Arab and Islamic in Qatar's capital.

The six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, which held its own meeting on the sidelines of the summit, decided to take steps ""to activate the mechanisms of joint defense and the Gulf deterrence. ""

The Gulf states also called on the US to use its influence to rein in Israel. 

""They have leverage and influence on Israel, and it's about time that this leverage and influence be used,"" the Gulf Cooperation Council Secretary General, Jasem Mohamed Al-Budaiwi said.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was in Israel on Monday, will head to Qatar next to voice ""America's full support for Qatar's security and sovereignty,"" the US State Department said. 

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has called for Israel and Russia to be barred from international sports competitions, citing what he described as ""barbaric acts"" in Gaza and Ukraine.

He expressed ""deep admiration"" for thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters who forced the Vuelta e Espana cycle race's final stage to be abandoned.

The protesters repeatedly targeted the race because of the participation of the Israel-Premier Tech team.

""Our position is clear and categorical: as long as the barbarity continues, neither Russia nor Israel should participate in any international competition,"" Sanchez said.

Cycling's global governing body, UCI, said it ""regretted"" the Spanish government's support for the protests and it ""could call into question Spain's ability to host major international sporting events.""

Germany's President Frank-Walter Steinmeier condemned the cancellation of a concert by Israeli conductor Lahav Shani in Belgium as ""blatant antisemitism.""

Last week, organizers of the Flanders Festival Ghent in Belgium said the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra would no longer perform on September 18 as planned due to concerns surrounding conductor Laha Shani.

In a statement, the organizers said they were ""unable to provide sufficient clarity about his [Shani's] attitude"" towards the Israeli government, which they referred to as a ""genocidal regime.""

The decision has drawn international criticism, including from Belgium's Prime Minister and Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

On Monday, Steinmeier hosted Shani in Berlin ahead of a performance of the Munich Philharmonic in the city in the evening. 

Born in Tel Aviv in 1989, Lahav Shani is considered one of classical music's brightest young stars. He is a conductor, pianist and double bassist.

Though he is already directing concerts with the Munich Philharmonic, he will officially become the new chief conductor of the German orchestra starting in September 2026. 

The Qatari ambassador to Berlin said his country is ""evaluating the situation"" following the Israeli strike in Doha that targeted several members of Palestinian militant group Hamas that reside in the city.

In a conversation with DW, ambassador Abdulla Al Hamar said Qatar is a ""very small, peaceful"" country that was hit by a ""barbaric"" Israeli attack, while trying to ""help release the (Israeli hostages).""

""That what we've been rewarded with from the Netanyahu government,"" he said.

Al Hamar also warned the mediation efforts could be harmed due to the anger felt by the Qatari people after the Israeli attack.

The diplomat also praised the ties between Qatar and the US, and expressed hope that Washington will tell Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel's strike on Qatar is unacceptable.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended his country's decision to launch an airstrike on Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar.

Almost a week after the Israeli strike in Doha, there has been no confirmation that any of the strike's targets was killed as a result, with Hamas saying its targeted leaders are all still alive.

""I don't accept the premise that the attack failed,"" Netanyahu said at a joint press conference with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

According to Netanyahu, the attack's purpose was to ""send out a message to terrorists: You can run, but we'll get you.""

""Terrorists should not have immunity, wherever they are,"" Netanyahu said, comparing the Israeli attack to US strikes targeting Al Qaeda head Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan.

The Israeli strike in Qatar resulted in widespread condemnations from around the world.

Jean-Guy Vataux, Head of Mission for Gaza from Doctors Without Borders says the situation in Gaza is ""hell,"" especially with the Israeli military's operation increasing in scale.

""Most of the movements we ask for at the moment have been denied by the Israeli army,"" he says.

Looking ahead, with the Israeli operation in Gaza City looming, Vataux says the hundreds of thousands to move to the enclave's southern parts threaten to collapse the area's health system as a whole.

""Gaza is the most dangerous place in the world for humanitarian action,"" he told DW, adding that the Gaza residents who go towards the south, as asked by Israel, will not have enough supplies and hospital beds.

""We're facing a real disaster in terms of provision of healthcare,"" he said. There is not enough water, food, or shelter available in the south for the people fleeing, Givateau added.

""In the south, all the hospitals are [already] overwhelmed,"" he said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel must prepare ""for some sort of (international) isolation.""

Netanyahu was quoted by Israeli media as saying the country will need to be ready for ""getting more and more used to an economy with autarkic (self-sufficient) aspects.""

""We will need to develop our weapon industry here… We don't have a choice,"" Netanyahu said.

The Israeli leader also said Europe's Muslim population would be party responsible for Israel's isolation.

""We live in a very challenging world. The Muslims who immigrated to Europe have become a significant, vocal minority. It bends local governments on Gaza,"" he said.

Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid criticised Netanyahu for his statement, saying the Israeli leader is responsible for the country's diplomatic issues.

""Netanyahu's statement that Israel is entering (international) isolation… is a mad statement,"" Lapid said, adding that Netanyahu and the Israeli government are turning Israel into a ""third world country.""
 

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Hamas ""feels emboldened"" by the announcement of several Western countries to recognize Palestinian statehood at the UN General Assembly in New York next week.

According to Rubio, Hamas ""walked away from agreements that they actually had tacitly agreed to"" due to what he called ""the international support they believe they're getting.""

The recognition of Palestine is ""largely symbolic"" and has ""no impact whatsoever about bringing us any closer to a Palestinian state,"" Rubio said.

The US diplomat spoke at a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netnayahu in Jerusalem.

The US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is continuing his visit to Israel in the wake of the Israeli attack on Hamas officials in Qatar, and multiple countries are expected to acknowledge Palestinian statehood at the UN General Assembly next week.

We are also looking at the situation in the Gaza Strip as the Israeli military offensive in Gaza City continues to expand.

Despite his public call to “just kill” unhoused people, Brian Kilmeade continues to host “Fox & Friends.”

After four days of backlash, Fox News anchor Brian Kilmeade has apologized for saying that authorities should “just kill” people experiencing homelessness and mental health crises with “involuntary lethal injection” — but it appears that he will remain in his role at “Fox & Friends.”

Kilmeade made his original comment during a “Fox & Friends” discussion on a woman who was stabbed and killed on a train in Charlotte, North Carolina, last month. 

Co-host Lawrence Jones said, of people experiencing homelessness: “You either take the resources we give you, or you decide that you're going to be locked up in jail.”

“Or involuntary lethal injection, or something, just kill them,” Kilmeade added.

The clip circulated widely across social media. Many users denounced Kilmeade's comments as disturbing and eugenicist, and some called for Kilmeade to resign.

Homelessness is at record highs and rising in the U.S. An estimated 770,000 people are experiencing homelessness across the country, as housing costs have skyrocketed, lawmakers have cut the social safety net, and Wall Street firms have bought up huge swaths of housing stock.

On Sunday, Kilmeade apologized, suggesting that “not all” people experiencing homelessness are the same.

“[We have] to stop these kinds of attacks by homeless, mentally ill assailants, including institutionalizing or jailing such people so they cannot attack again. During that discussion, I wrongly said they should get lethal injections. I apologize for that extremely callous remark,” he said.

“I'm obviously aware that not all mentally ill homeless people act as the perpetrator did in North Carolina, and that so many homeless people deserve our empathy and our compassion,” he went on.

Kilmeade has previously supported the killing of people experiencing homelessness. Last year, Kilmeade said that Daniel Penny was a “hero” for killing a Black unhoused man, Jordan Neely, on the subway in New York City in 2023.

Fox has not commented on Kilmeade's remark suggesting that hundreds of thousands of Americans should be eligible for capital punishment.

Some commentators have noted that dozens of people are currently losing their jobs for far less inflammatory comments about the killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk last week. Indeed, on Monday, Kilmeade promoted a story on the suspension of a New Jersey doctor accused of “celebrating” Kirk's death, inviting the nurse who reported the doctor— who is filing a lawsuit over the comment — on his show for an interview.

            Poland's foreign minister has suggested that NATO states should consider imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine to protect the alliance's territory and people from Russian drones.
    


            Radoslaw Sikorski's remarks follow an intrusion last week by Russian drones into Polish airspace. NATO fighter jets and air defenses shot down the drones, which were not armed.
    


            Speaking about extending such missions to Ukrainian airspace, Sikorski told the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine: “We as NATO and the EU could be capable of doing this, but it is not a decision that Poland can make alone; it can only be made with its allies.”
    


            “Protection for our population – for example, from falling debris – would naturally be greater if we could combat drones and other flying objects beyond our national territory.
    


            “If Ukraine were to ask us to shoot them down over its territory, that would be advantageous for us. If you ask me personally, we should consider it,” Sikorski added.
    


            A Ukrainian no-fly zone, which was promoted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky soon after Russia invaded Ukraine, was discussed by NATO allies during the Biden administration in 2022 but rejected for fear that direct confrontation with Russian combat planes could broaden the war.
    


            Sikorski's current proposal appears to be restricted to dealing with Russian drones approaching Ukraine's borders with NATO states.
    


            A total of 16 drones were found throughout the country after last Wednesday's incursion, Poland's interior ministry said. Polish and Dutch jets intercepted the drones, with assistance from Italian, German and NATO's multinational forces, officials said.
    


            In response to the drone incursions, Poland's NATO allies announced an “Eastern Sentry” mission to defend the country's airspace. On Monday, the United Kingdom announced that its Royal Air Force will join the mission.
    


            “The UK's commitment to helping NATO defend every inch of allied territory is unshakeable,” the UK's Ministry of Defense wrote on its X account.
    


            Sikorski told Frankfurter Allgemeine that it was no coincidence that so many drones had suddenly appeared over Poland.
    


            “Our air force repelled the threat for seven hours. So far, we have heard two explanations from the Russian government: that the drones accidentally flew over the border and that it is impossible for Russian drones to fly that far at all.”
    


            Russia's defense ministry said last week that it had carried out a strike against Ukraine overnight into Wednesday. It said that “no targets on the territory of Poland were planned for destruction,” and that the drones it used in Ukraine have a flight range of no more than 700 kilometers (435 miles).
    


            In addition to the intrusion into Poland, just days later Romania scrambled fighter jets after a Russian drone breached its airspace on Saturday.

            • New details: Tyler Robinson, the suspect in Charlie Kirk's murder, apparently confessed to the killing in a small chat group on the online platform Discord, the Washington Post reported today.
    


• Assassination roils DC: Vice President JD Vance hosted the “Charlie Kirk Show” podcast today as last week's political assassination continues to roil the country.
    


• Suspect's note: FBI Director Kash Patel provided new details about an alleged note written by the suspect. His interview with Fox was highly unusual, as FBI officials and Justice Department prosecutors generally avoid giving investigative details in a case that will be prosecuted.
    


            Tyler Robinson, the suspect in Charlie Kirk's murder, apparently confessed to killing the right-wing activist in a small chat group on the online platform Discord, the Washington Post reported today.
    


            A series of messages sent by Robinson to a small group of people show him saying he had “bad news,” and that it was “me at UVU yesterday,” the Post said, citing sources and screenshots the Post viewed.
    


            He told the group that he would be surrendering shortly and thanked them for “all the good times and laughs,” the outlet said, adding it didn't appear anyone responded to the chat.
    


            CNN has reached out to law enforcement about Discord chats in the case, as well as the Utah Department of Public Safety for comment.
    


            Robinson sent the messages about two hours before he was taken into custody, the Post said.
    


            Vice President JD Vance blamed Charlie Kirk's death on “a growing and powerful minority on the far left,” in his concluding remarks while hosting “The Charlie Kirk Show” today.
    


            “We can thank God that most Democrats don't share these attitudes, and I do, while acknowledging that something has gone very wrong with a lunatic fringe, a minority, but a growing and powerful minority on the far left,” Vance said on the show.
    


            Vance added that there could be “no unity” with the people who “celebrate Charlie Kirk's assassination” or “people who scream at children over their parents' politics.” He was referencing a time he went to Disneyland with his kids, when he said multiple people yelled offensive things at his family.
    


            “There was a loud and very vocal minority that would shout at my children, who were eight, five and three, whenever they got the opportunity. ‘You should disown your dad, you little sh*t,' one middle-aged woman yelled at my five year old,” Vance said. “‘Tell the Secret Service to protect the Constitution, not your father,' screamed another.”
    


            “Are these women violent? Probably not. Are they deranged? Certainly,” Vance concluded, claiming it was a “statistical fact” that “most of the lunatics in American politics today are proud members of the far left.”
    


            Vance's comments echo recent remarks by President Donald Trump and others within the administration. Speaking to NBC News on Saturday, Trump said he wants the nation to “heal,” but added, “We're dealing with a radical left group of lunatics, and they don't play fair and they never did.”
    


            Utah Democrats have received threatening calls and messages since Charlie Kirk was killed last week, Democratic state Rep. Angela Romero told CNN's Pamela Brown and Wolf Blitzer, calling it “a real eye-opener” to be blamed for Kirk's death.
    


            Romero, the Democratic leader in the state House, said that one person called “almost every Democrat,” calling them names and telling them to “leave the state,” with a tone that she described as “really frightening.”
    


            Asked by Blitzer whether state lawmakers are considering any bills in response to the fatal shooting, Romero said that “those are conversations we're going to have.” She and Utah Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla are also weighing an appropriation request related to safety and security funding, Romero said.
    


            “A lot more information” is expected to be released tomorrow once the state files charges against the suspect accused of killing Charlie Kirk, the Utah Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason told CNN's Boris Sanchez.
    


            “I do believe a lot more information tomorrow after those charges are filed will be able to speak to more of the intricacies of this investigation,” Mason said.
    


            Mason declined to offer any details on the case, saying he did not want to compromise the integrity of the case against the suspect, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson.
    


            He said investigators believe Robinson “acted alone” as the shooter. They are looking into the timeframe before and after the shooting, examining the suspect's online behavior and interviewing personal contacts to learn more about him, Mason said.
    


            “What I can speak to is we are still conducting follow-up interviews and a lot of investigative leads to determine any relationship that may have played into this, whether that be political or personal,” he said.
    


            He added that those who had contact with the suspect were “very cooperative” with investigators.
    


            Mason's decision not to offer further details on the evidence is a contrast to that of FBI Director Kash Patel, who provided intimate details on the case in an interview with Fox News this morning.

            A deal with China that would allow TikTok to remain operating in the United States is a crucial step toward arranging a meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the coming months, US officials said today after a framework plan was announced.
    


            Without a TikTok deal in place, a meeting between the two leaders wouldn't be possible, the officials said. But an agreement makes it more likely the two men sit down when Trump visits Asia at the end of October, according to those officials.
    


Here are the key things to know:



            White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said today the White House will be going after leftist “terror” networks who organize doxxing campaigns after the killing of Charlie Kirk.
    


                    “The organized doxxing campaigns, the organized riots, the organized street violence, the organized campaigns of dehumanization, vilification, posting people's addresses, combining that with messaging that's designed to trigger and incite violence and the actual organized cells that carry out and facilitate the violence. It is a vast domestic terror movement,” Miller told Vice President JD Vance, who was guest hosting an episode of “The Charlie Kirk Show.”
                





            Miller did not specify any specific groups. He vowed to “use every resource we have at the Department of Justice, Homeland Security, and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle, and destroy these networks and make America safe again for the American people.”
    


            He added they would do it “in Charlie's name.”
    


            Vance had numerous guests on the show to talk about Kirk's assassination last week. Erika Kirk, the slain conservative activist's widow, on Friday called the vice president a “dear friend” of her husband and thanked him and second lady Usha Vance “for their love and support.”
    


            Officials from US and China held “candid and in-depth exchanges” and have “reached a basic framework consensus” to keep TikTok operational in the United States, Li Chenggang, China's top trade negotiator and vice commerce minister, said today.
    


            The talks between the two countries took places over the last two days in Spain and is the culmination of a years-long effort to determine the future of TikTok in the United States.
    


            The framework agreed upon includes “resolving TikTok-related issues through cooperation, reducing investment barriers, and promoting relevant economic and trade cooperation,” Li said at a news conference in Madrid, according to Chinese state media.
    


            US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said President Donald Trump will speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping Friday to finalize the deal.
    


Remember: TikTok briefly went dark on January 18, 2025, ahead of a US ban of the app. A bipartisan bill passed by Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden toward the end of his term banned TikTok in the United States because of national security concerns, allowing the app to continue operating in America only if its China-based owner divested its stake in the US assets of the social media company.
    


            Lawyers for Jeffrey Epstein's estate provided a second production of documents to the House Oversight Committee on Friday, according to a letter obtained by CNN.
    


            The document production included two more pages from Epstein's so-called birthday book – a collection of letters gifted to the late convicted sex offender for his 50th birthday – that were redacted in the first production earlier this month.
    


            The latest batch of documents also included another address book belonging to Epstein, according to the letter.
    


            Epstein's estate will continue producing documents to the congressional panel on a rolling basis in response to its subpoena.
    


            Charlie Kirk's team had been in constant coordination with the FBI ensuring Kirk's safety amid many threats, Andrew Kolvet, the executive producer of “The Charlie Kirk Show” told CNN's Pamela Brown.
    


            Kolvet said they discussed additional protective measures but ultimately held back because Kirk “loved interacting with” the community. He said Kirk wanted to be as close to his supporters as possible, shaking hands and tossing hats into the crowd.
    


            As Kirk mobilized young conservatives on college campuses, he faced numerous personal threats in recent years.
    


            And his stops on campus tours were often met with impassioned protests that sometimes spiraled into chaos and violence, leading some schools to adopt strict security measures around his appearances.
    


            As authorities continue investigating Kirk's fatal shooting at his campus visit in Utah on Wednesday — the first on another nationwide tour of colleges — they have not yet said whether he faced any specific, recent threats before the event.
    


CNN's Curt Devine, Rob Kuznia and Dalia Faheid contributed to this report.



            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio doubled down on the administration's pledge to deny and revoke visas from those who the US deems as celebrating the murder of Charlie Kirk.
    


                    “We should not be giving visas to people who are going to come to the United States and do things like celebrate the murder, the execution, the assassination of a political figure,” Rubio said in an interview with Fox News today.“And if they're already here, we should be revoking their visa. Why would we want to bring people into our country they're going to engage in negative and destructive behavior?” he continued.
                





            The State Department has not responded to questions on whether any visas have actually been revoked or how many officials are working on this initiative. It is unclear under what legal authorities the State Department would revoke the visas. The agency has said free speech is a priority.
    


            In a post last week, Deputy Secretary of State Chris Landau said he had directed consular officers, who are involved in adjudicating visas, “to undertake appropriate action” against people “praising, rationalizing, or making light of” Kirk's death.
    


            The suspect in last week's killing of Charlie Kirk wrote that he had the “opportunity to take out” the conservative influencer, and “I'm going to take it,” FBI Director Kash Patel said today.
    


            The message was written prior to Wednesday's shooting, Patel told Fox News. It's unclear which form the message took; Patel described it as both a “note” and a “text message exchange.” He said the writing had since been “destroyed” but was recovered by investigators.
    


            Patel did not share the full text of the message.
    


            Patel's interview with Fox is highly unusual, as FBI officials and Justice Department prosecutors generally avoid giving investigative details in a case that will be prosecuted for fear that it could damage the case.
    


            Patel also said that DNA recovered from a screwdriver and towel which were both found with the gun used in Kirk's killing were matched for the suspect in the assassination, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson.
    


            Robinson's family, Patel said, told investigators that Robinson had “subscribed to left-wing ideology.” Patel did not provide specifics on what that ideology included.
    


            Robinson's family, Patel said, told investigators that Robinson had “subscribed to left-wing ideology.”
    


            Patel defended his agency's role in the shooting amid mounting questions over his handling of the case and his leadership of the FBI. Bureau employees previously told CNN they were frustrated with how Patel led the investigation.

            Qatari and US  officials had “serious discussions” about the two countries' bilateral security and defense partnership after Israel targeted Hamas officials in an airstrike in Doha last week, a diplomat with knowledge of the discussions told CNN.
    


            The discussions also included Qatar's potential purchase of more advanced US defense equipment, the diplomat said.
    


            Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani visited the White House and had dinner with US President Donald Trump on Friday, three days after the Israeli strike.
    


            Trump has said publicly that he was “very unhappy about every aspect” of the Israeli attack.
    


            Arab and Muslim leaders are meeting in Qatar today to discuss a response to last week's Israeli strike. The diplomat said that Gulf Arab nations are in advanced discussions to solidify their collective military defense.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will visit the Qatari capital Doha tomorrow following a visit to Israel, the diplomat told CNN earlier.

            If you're just joining us, we're covering political developments in Washington, DC and beyond.
    


Here's what to watch so far this morning:



Charlie Kirk: Vice President JD Vance said that he will host the “Charlie Kirk Show” podcast at noon today. Meanwhile, FBI Director Kash Patel provided new details about a note written by the suspect in Kirk's assassination. The White House has also requested an additional $58 million in security funding for the executive and judicial branches Kirk's assassination, a Republican aide said.
    


Rubio in Mideast: Rubio met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem this morning. Israeli sources told CNN before the meeting that the Netanyahu was expected to raise his government's potential West Bank annexation plans. Rubio's visit comes after Israel's strike in Doha last week. The secretary of state will also travel to Qatar, a senior State Department official said.
    


Nuclear power deal with UK: The US and UK governments will sign an agreement this week ushering in new deals on nuclear power between companies in the two countries. The news comes ahead of Trump's state visit. You can read more details here about what to expect.



TikTok deal: A deal has been reached between the Trump administration and China to keep TikTok operational in the United States, US administration officials said, concluding a yearslong effort that began during President Donald Trump's first term. The US president said he would be speaking to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Friday.
    


Ukraine-Russia: Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there has been no progress toward setting up a trilateral summit with Ukraine and the United States.
    


            Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there has been no progress toward setting up a trilateral summit with Ukraine and the United States.
    


            US President Donald Trump had raised that prospect after his Alaska summit last month with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin has since insisted on several conditions for such a meeting.
    


            But asked about the possibility on a media call today, Peskov said: “There is no progress so far,” adding there was a “pause” in the negotiation process on the conflict in Ukraine.
    


            Asked about Trump's remarks on Friday that his patience with Putin was wearing thin, Peskov said that the Kremlin had “heard these statements,” and Russia remained ready to resolve the crisis by political and diplomatic means.
    


            President Donald Trump suggested that a deal has been reached with China to keep TikTok operational in the United States, the conclusion of a yearslong effort that began during Trump's first term.
    


                    “The big Trade Meeting in Europe between The United States of America, and China, has gone VERY WELL! It will be concluding shortly,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “A deal was also reached on a ‘certain' company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save. They will be very happy! I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday.”
                





More on TikTok talks: Chinese and US diplomats have been meeting this week in Spain, to discuss trade and other matters. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, leading the latest round of trade talks on behalf of the United States, had said that TikTok was one of the subjects likely to be discussed.
    


            Trump multiple times has extended a self-imposed deadline to reach a deal with China to sell at least part of its US TikTok business to an American-backed owner. A bipartisan bill passed by Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden banned TikTok in the United States unless its China-based owner divested its stake in the US assets of the social media company.
    


            The deadline had most recently been extended to Wednesday.
    


            The killing of Charlie Kirk is an attempt to silence those who want to openly engage in debate with those with opposing views, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said today while in Israel.
    


            Rubio said that it was a “particularly difficult week” for the White House because Kirk was not only a supporter of President Donald Trump but also a “personal friend” to a lot of people at the White House.
    


            Rubio went on to talk about Kirk's efforts to engage with people he disagreed with.
    


                    “Apart from the tragedy of it for him and for his family and for the nation really is the irony: Charlie was one of the few people out there who was actually engaging in what we need more of. And that is debate and conversation among people with strong disagreements,” Rubio said.He added, “He would go on college campuses, and he would actively seek out and invite people who strongly disagreed with him to come to the microphone and engage in a back and forth. The alternative to the back and forth is just to attack each other. It's very easy to do just do podcasts and just do interviews and give speeches where you attack the other side. It's much harder to engage with people whose views are diametrically opposed to yours and engage them in a debate. And he did that.”
                





            The secretary of state said that he believes the assassination was not only an effort to silence Kirk but also to intimidate others who wanted to engage in open dialogue with those with opposing viewpoints.
    


            The US and UK governments will sign an agreement this week ushering in new deals on nuclear power between companies in the two countries.
    


            Among other things, the accord will make it easier to build new nuclear power stations in both countries – for example, by reducing the time it takes for a nuclear project to get a license from roughly three or four years to about two, the UK government said in a statement today.
    


                    “With President Trump's leadership, the United States is ushering in a true nuclear renaissance – harnessing the power of commercial nuclear to meet rising energy demand and fuel the AI revolution,” US energy secretary Chris Wright said in the statement.
                





            The agreement between DC and London, announced ahead of President Donald Trump's state visit to the UK this week, clears the way for “a major expansion” of new nuclear projects in the country, according to the British government.
    


            It is also in line with moves by the US administration earlier this year to boost nuclear energy, which include measures to speed up reactor testing and expand the enrichment of uranium.
    


            Nuclear power, generally, doesn't emit planet-warming pollution when generated or used. However, one problem is storing radioactive waste, which can remain dangerous for thousands of years.
    


            Charlie Kirk's assassination has not yet crystallized into hard policy responses by the Trump administration, leaving the country in limbo, on the brink of something potentially significant that is yet to be defined.
    


            The graphic nature of Kirk's killing, which could be witnessed by anyone with a cellphone, and the conservative activist's youth, political power and proximity to President Donald Trump may enshrine it as a searing collective moment in modern US history.
    


            Its potential to galvanize profound reactions is more potent because it took place in a nation racked by its most venomous divides in decades, where every political win or loss can seem existential, and under an administration that often shows a desire to wield almost unlimited power.
    


            This is also an age when activists and partisan media figures on the left and the right have personal and financial incentives to stoke division and social media tools to magnify their extremism.
    


            This is a significant impediment for those political leaders who genuinely want to cool tempers. And no wonder lawmakers and opinion formers are reconsidering their exposure to the public following Kirk's killing in a hunkering-down that could further constrain American democracy.
    


                    Trump has not chosen the traditional presidential route of invoking calm at perilous political moments. He's ominously blaming his opponents collectively for a spate of worsening political violence that has spilled blood on both sides. “The problem is on the left. It's not on the right,” he said Sunday.
                





            One fear is that the assassination of Kirk, who took Trump's MAGA movement to a younger generation of voters, will provoke more violence or reprisals against other political leaders, or will stifle open public debate.
    


Read the full analysis.



            The White House has requested an additional $58 million in security funding for the executive and judicial branches following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, a Republican aide said.
    


            The funding request is being “actively processed” in the context of the stopgap funding bill, the aide said.
    


            The request comes amid heightened concerns about security, including among members of Congress, in the wake of the Kirk assassination. On Sunday, House Speaker Mike Johnson said leadership is looking at “all options” to bolster member security.

Fox News correspondent Christina Coleman reports on the upcoming memorial service for Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk and the outpouring of support his family has received since his assassination on 'Fox News Live.'

A small business in Idaho is receiving backlash for paying tribute to Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk.

Grooveberries Frozen Yogurt in Coeur d'Alene has been placing stickers with a photo of the conservative activist on its red cups, with ""1993-2025"" shown beneath his name.

Sarah and Chase Gibson, owners of Grooveberries and the parents of three children, told Fox News Digital they have received death threats for honoring Kirk's legacy.

""We have been receiving hate. Even someone saying we should be dead,"" said Sarah Gibson.

A main reason for the outpouring of community support they've received, she said, is likely due to the initial hate that came their way.

""I love how supportive our community is,"" said Sarah Gibson. ""Their support for Charlie and what he stands for completely outshines the negativity.""

Grooveberries has received direct emails to the shop and a slew of hateful reviews on Facebook.

As shared with Fox News Digital, one email said, ""You guys are sick. … The man is dead, thank God for that, you guys should be dead for what you're doing, selling products [about] a piece of s--- person.""

""Better not make a black and white Charlie Kirk recipe,"" said another message, in part.

One Facebook review called the shop owners ""White supremacists,"" telling other people not to give them their money.

""I don't like fascism mixed in my yogurt,"" posted one user.

Another person said, ""Imagine using a fascist's death to increase prices to rip off other fascists. Guess I actually support that.""

The owners said they plan to reach out to Meta to see if the troubling comments can be removed. 

""People need to know that this is how [those on] the Left choose to handle people they don't agree with,"" said Gibson.

Gibson added that the backlash they've received has been a big reason their community has become even more emboldened to take a stand.

""Charlie Kirk died a martyr for his faith in Jesus Christ,"" she told Fox News Digital on Sunday. ""He spoke the truth even when it was hard. He never backed down from his stance on spreading the truth with the goal of saving the lost.""

Sarah Gibson said Kirk's legacy needs to be honored and his messages continued.

""We refuse to allow his voice to go silent,"" she said. ""The world as a whole needs us to continue carrying his message forward in his earthly absence.""

Stephanie Hamill, a political commentator, told Fox News Digital the number of people celebrating Kirk's death has shaken her to her core.

""That's why it was so refreshing to see even small gestures of kindness — like a tribute cup honoring Charlie Kirk's life in my own community,"" she said. ""When I stopped in for frozen yogurt with my family on Saturday night, I was pleasantly surprised to see those cups sitting on the counter.""

""Charlie Kirk died a martyr for his faith in Jesus Christ,"" said the co-owner of a store that is honoring him with special commemorative cups.  (Grooveberries)

She said Grooveberries is her favorite frozen yogurt shop.

""Regardless of where anyone stands on Charlie's political views, he was a husband and a father,"" she said. ""His life was taken from him in one of the most horrific and public ways imaginable, and honoring his memory should never be controversial.""

The Gibsons opened Grooveberries in 2021 after the coronavirus pandemic. They've written on their website that ""their faith is the cornerstone of their lives and work.""

Sarah Gibson said she's already placed another ""huge order"" of Kirk stickers and wants to continue making the cups available for as long as consumers demand them. 

The shop has been tracking all sales and plans to send funds to Charlie Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, for a ""blueberry budget,"" referencing what Mrs. Kirk said in her public statement after her husband's assassination.

Pastor and Project H.O.O.D. founder Corey Brooks reflects on his friendship with Charlie Kirk and the legacy the Turning Point USA founder leaves behind.

The Dallas Cowboys were among the teams to honor Charlie Kirk before kickoff on Sunday following the conservative influencer's assassination in Utah earlier in the week.

The Cowboys put a picture of Kirk onto their videoboard in AT&T Stadium before the team played the New York Giants.

Cowboys team owner Jerry Jones talked to reporters after the game and explained why the team decided to honor the 31-year-old.

""We just all abhor violence. And it's impacting us all. And, certainly, we all stand together on any front, relative to the threat of violence.… I was a young guy, but aware, in the ‘60s when we had huge violence, lost President (John F.) Kennedy and his brother and many, many others, Martin Luther King,"" he said, via The Athletic. 

""It's something that we all really need to just be aware of, support our law enforcement, and do everything we can to keep the violence in check.""

The Cowboys, Tennessee Titans, New York Jets and New Orleans Saints honored Kirk before the 1 p.m. ET games began. The Arizona Cardinals and Kansas City Chiefs followed suit in the late afternoon games.

The Baltimore Ravens, Cincinnati Bengals, Detroit Lions, Minnesota Vikings and Indianapolis Colts chose not to.

Kirk was shot and killed while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. The shooting sparked a 33-hour manhunt and led to the arrest of Tyler Robinson in connection with the incident on Friday.

Arizona State Sen. Jake Hoffman (R) joined 'Fox & Friends First' to reflect on the D.C. vigil, Charlie Kirk's legacy after his assassination and more. 

Hundreds of mourners attended a memorial service and prayer vigil for Charlie Kirk at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., on Sunday night to honor the political activist's legacy after an assassin's bullet took his life last week.

Lines of people, many of whom were wearing black or shirts and pins with the word ""freedom,"" were seen waiting to enter. Inside, young children were seen running up and down the aisles as their parents sang praise and worship songs at the faith-filled memorial. Top Republican leaders, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, delivered remarks at the event.

""It's been a mixture of unspeakable sadness and grief and anger and even fear,"" Johnson said. ""It's as if a dark shadow was cast over our country.""

Johnson added that he believes Kirk ""would never want us to be overcome by despair, he would want exactly the opposite.""

""And we'd do well to be reminded that the best way to honor his memory and to honor his unmatched legacy is to live as Charlie did,"" the Louisiana Republican said.

Gabbard reflected on how even though the 31-year-old's life was cut short, ""his impact here and around the world is profound, and it is a beautiful thing to see it playing out now.""

""Ultimately, for every one of us, the time that we have in this world is temporary,"" said Gabbard. ""Our time will come sooner or later.""

""And so the critical question that we have for ourselves is whatever time we have, what are we doing with it? How are we making the most of every day that we have?""

""He encouraged young people to get married and to have children. It is our most important mission on this earth,"" she said.

Kennedy said he and Kirk became ""spiritual brothers"" after meeting during a podcast interview in 2021 before sharing a personal anecdote about dealing with grief and loss in his family.

""When my brother David died, I had a conversation with my mother who had been through more than her share of loss and tragedy,"" Kennedy said. ""And I said, I asked her ... does the hole they leave in you when they die, does it ever get any smaller?""

""And she said, no, it never gets any smaller. But our job is to build ourselves bigger around the hole,"" he added.

Colin Cowherd lists his NFL power rankings entering Week 2 of the 2025/26 NFL season, including the Green Bay Packers, Los Angeles Rams, Kansas City Chiefs, and Philadelphia Eagles. 

The Philadelphia Eagles' use of the tush push was a hot topic of discussion in the offseason as NFL owners nearly voted to effectively ban the play.

While the Eagles' famous play survived the vote, it came under fire on Sunday evening in the team's 20-17 victory against the Kansas City Chiefs. The play was used multiple times during the game, and quarterback Jalen Hurts scored on it in the fourth quarter, which gave the team a comfortable enough lead to secure the victory.

NFL fans noticed that Eagles offensive linemen may have been moving before the snap while the center may have been over the ball before it was given to Hurts.

ESPN NFL insider Adam Schefter said on ""Get Up"" on Monday that the Chiefs lost the game in March.

""This game was lost in March. This game was lost when the NFL owners refused to ban the tush push from happening. It wasn't lost yesterday. It was lost in March,"" he said. 

""And there might be a lot of games the Eagles play that were lost in March because this play is unstoppable. Not only the defense doesn't know how to handle it but not even the officials know how to handle it. You're seeing the Eagles' linemen jump offside every play and nothing's called.""

The Eagles have used the play for a few years and opposing teams have not been able to stop it for the most part.

FAYETTE CITY, Pennsylvania — “I grew up here,” says Don, a 57-year-old man at the bar after a Tuesday of digging ditches and mowing lawns. “It's the black hole of Pennsylvania.”

Don isn't talking just about Fayette City, this tiny dying town on the Monongahela River. He's talking about this whole corner of Pennsylvania, this part of the Monongahela Valley, and mostly about Fayette County.

“This is a s***hole,” says Ashley, a bartender in Uniontown, the county seat. “It's scary.”

WHAT HAPPENS AFTER TRUMP IN STEEL AND COAL COUNTRY?

You wouldn't call it a hole of any sort if you were just passing through on the highways. In fact, this is beautiful country. The Monongahela River winds through the hills and bluffs. While you drive around the county, the sights often take your breath away.

This is where Frank Lloyd Wright built Fallingwater, his legendary home. When Pittsburgh industrialists Willard Rockwell and later Joseph Hardy wanted to build a resort — Nemacolin, it's called — they chose a Fayette County mountainside.

When steel and coal were king, this area was the beating heart of the American dream. Good jobs were plentiful in the mills. Small towns swarmed with families. Downtowns bustled, and churches burst at the seams.

Now it's gone: the mills, the flower shops, half the churches. The Community Center of Fayette City, where today's middle-aged residents recall Girl Scout meetings and summer theaters, is abandoned and crumbling.

“Most of the buildings up in town need to be torn down,” says Vicky Prokopovitch, proprietor of the Pitt Stop convenience store at the end of Fayette City's Main Street.

And the less visible absences are just as profound: Marriage and work are less common here than in the past and less common than in neighboring counties, while crime and drugs are worse.

“Something left here,” sighs Don, at the bar down the road, meditating on the tales of Fayette City's golden days.

It's no mystery on one level: The steel jobs left. The Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Company shuttered the Allensport mill, right across the river from Fayette City, in 2008 after decades of a slow death. Bethlehem Steel closed its Monessen plant a few years earlier.

“That's where everyone used to work,” Prokopovitch says.

But many other parts of Pennsylvania and Ohio were hit hard by the steel industry's woes, including Pittsburgh itself. Most of those places have recovered at least a bit and found new footing. Not Fayette County.

“I don't think it's ever going to happen here,” Don says. Prokopovitch and her friend Cathy at the Pitt Stop convenience store in Fayette City agree — they have no hope for the future.

And you'll hear the same talk at Smitty's Bar and Restaurant down in Uniontown.

So, why does this one county lag behind the rest of the state and have so much more suffering?

The story of Fayette County doesn't end with the economy, but that's a good place to start.

More than 12% of Fayette County families live in poverty. That's 50% higher than the statewide level. Among Pennsylvania's 31 counties with populations above 100,000, only Philadelphia has a higher percentage in poverty.

Here's another measure: The average income in the state is about $69,000. In Fayette County, it's $51,000. Only two large Pennsylvania counties are poorer than Fayette by this measure.

Economic woe isn't surprising in a place where the steel mills closed down. But here's a stat that might surprise you: The unemployment rate is about 5%, worse than the statewide average today but historically very good.

But the unemployment rate doesn't tell you everything, because people not seeking work don't count as unemployed. Fayette has the lowest labor-force-participation rate of any large county in the state, minus Centre County, where Penn State's massive student body, who, as full-time students, are not full-time workers, throws off the number. In other words, Fayette County leads the state in men and women who aren't even looking for work.

Sheryl, a woman in her 20s, sits on her front stoop on Millview Road on Wednesday morning. She's double-hatting: babysitting a toddler and working as the caretaker for a woman the age of her own mother. “A lot of people around here get mainly SSI and stuff like that,” referring to Supplemental Security Income, or disability pay.

Likewise, 1 in 4 residents of the county is on food stamps, a higher proportion than in any county besides Philadelphia.

In bordering Washington and Westmoreland counties, the food stamp rates are about half the rate in Fayette County.

Prokopovitch worked for 20 years in the Belle Vernon Area School District, which has consolidated over the years as the population has shrunk. The district straddles the county line with Washington County.

Prokopovitch says you could tell by sight which students were from which side of the county line.

“You got the poverty side and you got the hoity-toities, or whatever you want to call them,” she says.

This divide is true on all sorts of indicators. Fayette County stands above, or below, its neighbors and most of the rural counties in Pennsylvania. And it's not just about economics.

Kevin Crossland sits at the breakfast counter of Mark C's, an old Steelers-colored diner on the edge of Uniontown, and proudly tells me the term he introduced to the locals: “Firstmas.”

“Happy Firstmas,” he tells his buddies on the first of each month, when they get their disability checks. “It's the only holiday the government celebrates 12 times a year,” he chuckles. Around Uniontown, he says, “You can see everybody like, ‘Oh my God, Happy Firstmas.' You know, Walmart's packed. Everything's out. The restaurants are full. So we call it Firstmas.”

The food stamp numbers, like the men and women not even in the labor force, are the quantifiable signs of collapse.

Walk the streets of downtown Uniontown, and you see the other signs: Idle men, in their 20s, 30s, and 40s on the stairs of public housing near Gallatin Avenue, a few blocks from stores with “help wanted” signs. Talk to employers — Don, who does landscaping; Crossland, who maintains rental homes; funeral directors — and they'll tell you how hard it is to hire anyone, especially on the books.

“Under-the-table is everything here,” one employer says. “The minute you mention a W-9, they walk away,” because an on-the-books job would cost them their disability or unemployment checks.

The working men and women I talk to admit to feeling like chumps at times because their neighbor gets by on giving occasional front-porch haircuts and otherwise being idle.

But it's clear that the unemployed men of Uniontown or nearby Connellsville are not thriving.

A Fayette County man is 10% less likely to get married than the average Pennsylvania man, and much more likely to get divorced. Last year, for instance, there were 631 marriages and 361 divorces in the county. That's 57 divorces per 100 marriages — by far the worst ratio among the state's large counties.

“The road across from me,” Prokopovitch says, “we call it Divorce Lane. Everybody on that road has been divorced.”

Family life here is pretty tough. Conversations about the areas typically turn to all the family or kid activities that have disappeared.

“We used to have a drive-in,” says Cathy, a middle-aged woman drinking coffee at Pitt Stop. “Where the Walmart is, that used to be Super 71 drive-in. … Then, as kids, we also had a roller-skating rink on 906 — Piggly-Wiggly. … Ice skating at Rostraver Gardens.”

Crystal Pool in Uniontown, the go-kart track in Uniontown — all gone.

“There used to be all this stuff,” says Shannon, a retired and disabled lady sitting on a stoop on Millview Road. “There's not much for kids up here to do.”

Ashley, the bartender at Smitty's, is raising three children here, and “I don't let them do anything,” because of safety concerns. “Some kid O.D.'d on fentanyl at a high school football game.”

Ashley does plenty with her children. “We hike. We fish. But I don't let them do anything without me.”

Sheryl says it's a fine town as long as you don't let your children out after dark, and they stay away from Gallatin Avenue, which is a couple of hundred yards from where she is babysitting. “That's where you find your prostitutes and stuff.”

It's when you talk about family that the conversation turns dark, and folks start to mention Child and Youth Services.

At one point, Ashley leans over the bar and asks me, “Did you hear what happened to that 9-year-old girl?”

She's not the first one this week to ask the same question in hushed tones. Talk to anyone for long enough in Fayette County, and they'll mention “that 9-year-old girl,” Renesmay Eutsey, whose body was found last week in a trash bag in the Youghiogheny River.

Eutsey was reported missing on Sept. 3. Her biological mother had placed her and her two siblings in the care of a relative, Kourtney Eutsey. Kourtney and her wife, Sarah Shipley, lived in Dunbar Township, just outside of Connellsville, which is one city over from Uniontown.

Renesmay Eutsey died on Sept. 2, and the couple tried to bury the body, not wanting officials to see her horrible burns. Soon, they decided to put her corpse in a trash bag inside a tote bag and toss her in the river.

Both women have been charged with criminal homicide, and questions are arising about how long Kourtney Eutsey and Shipley abused and neglected the children — and why CYS never intervened.

The local district attorney says the tale of abuse goes back further: “There has been a long, long history of family issues involving drugs, sexual offenders, deplorable conditions. It's pretty clear, from at least what I've seen, that there have been years and years of failures with the family with this child.”

“A lot of people around this area have gone through a lot of trauma,” Sheryl says from the stoop on Millview Road.

Smitty's is the place where, years ago, I first came face to face with the rural plague of deaths of despair. I drove to Fayette County ahead of the 2016 election because it showed up in my research as the county with the greatest drop-off in religiosity, both protestant and Catholic. I figured, correctly, that this would be a hot spot of President Donald Trump's surge in Pennsylvania.

I underestimated the extent of Uniontown's pathologies. At one point, I was giving a hard time to Dave, a customer who told me he was on disability because his back pain precluded even sitting at a desk for half an hour. “You've been sitting at the bar for an hour and a half,” I prodded him.

“I'm numb right now,” he said, staring straight at me, “because my son just died.”

It was an overdose. Those aren't rare here, though Prokopovitch says Fayette City doesn't have too many addicts now because they all died a few years back.

Crossland, the local landlord, points to drugs as the reason he can't retain workers. “I know too many people that think that's the only way, you know: get up and smoke one,” and get on welfare.

“One of the rarest things in this valley is clean piss,” Don says.

Mike is drinking at Smitty's in Uniontown on Tuesday night. He grew up here, got married, had two children, and got a job in the mines. Then, his wife died.

“She drank herself to death,” he tells me.

Before COVID-19, Fayette County had a premature death rate of 677 per 100,000. That's 43% higher than the statewide average and 20% higher than neighboring counties Washington and Westmoreland.

“For every person we get over 80, we get three or four ages 30 to 60,” a local funeral home director tells me.

On drug overdose deaths per capita, Fayette is among the five worst of the 31 large counties.

Some locals will tell you it's not too bad. Crossland argues that it's a great place to live, but he also told me that he packs heat when it comes time to confront a nonpaying tenant.

“It's the same as anywhere,” Sheryl says.

But it's not.

Uniontown has a violent crime rate of 12.6 per 1,000 residents. That's almost five times the state rate, and it puts Uniontown in the worst 1% of cities. Philadelphia's violent crime rate is 9.9, and Pittsburgh's is 5.8.

It's one more score where Fayette County is a black hole.

What is it about this county that makes it stand out in all the worst ways?

It's “the mentality,” Don says from the bar in Fayette City. “The mentality will never leave here.” What is that mentality, I ask. “I don't know. I can't figure it out. The work ethic?”

When you ask locals for an explanation, most just describe the county as stuck. Bad things happened in the past, and it created a culture of drug abuse, neglect, and laziness. Now that culture, that mentality, dominates.

The closure of the mills, by this telling, dug a hole, a “black hole” or a “s***hole,” and nobody can climb out of this valley of death.

Welfare is probably the most common culprit in my conversations with locals. One local businessman says Fayette County makes it easier to get benefits such as disability, food stamps, and housing assistance. Eligibility rules are uniform throughout the state, but the locals who work say that the county is more liberal in practice than others.

Stay out late enough, earn the trust of the locals, and folks will start talking about corruption. Nobody will badmouth the local politicos and kingmakers on the record, but they'll tell stories. “The same guy painted the lines on the roads for 50 years,” one local woman said. “There was no bidding on the job.”

The insiders entrenched themselves and enriched themselves and did nothing to help this part of the valley climb back up.

All of these explanations are true. None allows for an easy cure.

The state pumps money into redevelopment here. A few years back, folks were talking about Uniontown gentrifying. No more.

WHY THEY DON'T LEAVE

Trump keeps promising to resurrect the steel industry here. That's not happening.

Sometimes, when the social fabric is thin and when the economy hangs on just one or two pillars, a place is vulnerable.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is calling on states to submit “bold, audacious proposal ideas” to revitalize rural healthcare using the funds appropriated by Republicans in the budget bill this summer. 

Kennedy and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz announced on Monday that states are now eligible to submit proposals for funding by the Rural Hospital Transformation Program passed in President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July. 

“We encourage governors to submit bold, audacious proposal ideas as strong as the people they serve,” Kennedy said in a video posted on X. Together, we will build a rural health system that works strong, sustainable, centered on patients, and we will make rural America healthy again.” 

The Rural Hospital Transformation Program allocates $10 billion annually between 2026 and 2030, totaling $50 billion over the next five years. 

Each year, the $10 billion will be split down the middle, with 50% going evenly to each state and the other half being given to states based upon “a variety of factors” as determined by the CMS administrator. 

Securing rural healthcare funding was a point of bipartisan contention during debates over the passage of Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, largely due to the statute's $1 billion reduction in long-term Medicaid spending and technical changes on how states can raise Medicaid revenues. 

Rural hospitals have been struggling for decades. More than 1 in 4 of the nation's 1,700 rural hospitals in the United States had negative operating margins in 2023. 

That's mainly because, as medical technology becomes more specialized and expensive, it becomes more difficult for smaller hospitals to afford to offer high-quality care to patients. As a result, patients are increasingly willing to travel farther distances for top-notch services, creating a negative feedback loop of low revenue streams for rural providers. 

During his video address with Kennedy on Monday, Oz said that rural health funding is “not about sustaining failures” but rather “building success.”

“The program tackles the root causes of rural healthcare failure. It gives states the tools to design solutions that last, not band aids that fail,” Oz said.

The statute gives Oz as CMS Administrator a wide latitude to determine which states and projects receive funding. 

Oz and Kennedy said the funding is circumscribed to five “buckets” ranging from innovative care and technology solutions to improving rural facilities and regional systems. 

The Make America Healthy Again agenda, which focuses on preventive medicine, also offers funding opportunities for states focused on nutrition and physical activity resources. 

Oz also outlined that improving the rural healthcare workforce will be a key priority, including reforming medical licensing procedures for better interstate exchange.

“Rural health depends on people,” said Oz. “States can recruit and retain professionals by letting pharmacists and nurse practitioners expand their roles and by streamlining licensing across state lines; all this becomes feasible, and without it, shortages are going to continue to choke rural healthcare.”

In an exclusive interview with the Washington Examiner during the rural health program's planning stages, Oz said his agency intended to provide governors with a “Chinese menu approach” of program ideas that could be modified and tailored to each state's individual needs.

 “Take them if you want, modify them so they fit the needs of your state, and hopefully that'll accelerate the process for you,” Oz said in August.

DR. OZ'S PLAN FOR THE $50 BILLION IN RURAL HOSPITAL FUNDS

The deadline for states to apply for funding is Nov. 5. Award decisions will be announced by CMS on Dec. 31, with funds to be allocated in January 2026. 

“For too long, when it comes to health care access and infrastructure, we've left behind the backbone of America,” Oz said in a press statement. “That stops now with this program that will spark real change for rural health care.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

One might expect the Left, which so often brands itself as the champion of love and tolerance, to extend sympathy and solidarity even toward those with whom it disagrees after the murder of Charlie Kirk. Yet recent events reveal that this claim rings hollow.

An adjunct professor at New York University wrote that “MAGAS” are “liars” and “should be excluded from public discourse,” The College Fix reported.

‘LOVE TRUMPS HATE,' DEMOCRATS' IRONIC MESSAGING

The post received comments from supporters, who added that Kirk was the “cause” of the shooting, not the victim. But his post, and the replies, are not isolated incidents. 

“Kill all Charlie Kirks” was spray-painted on a sign in Seattle Central College, which goes to show that leftists hate and their calls for murder have only intensified throughout college campuses. 

Overseas, George Abaraonye, president of the student union at the University of Oxford, publicly called the Right “cancers” that must be removed “by any means necessary.”

Abaraonye was elected to his seat by a wide margin and previously debated Kirk at the university in May.

Now, these remarks do not come as a surprise. As seen last week, we already know that Western academia has fallen victim to the Left's radicalization tactics. However, the fact that these remarks have been mirrored beyond the boundaries of American college campuses is alarming. 

Fiona Wild, a local elected official in England, championed his death, saying “good riddance,” and implied that more acts of violence against Kirk's supporters should follow. 

The nightmare then worsens, as the Left has begun to go after those who survived Kirk, including his wife, Erika. 

Pakistani-American writer Wajahat Ali took shots at Erika Kirk, stating she will now promote “Kirk's vehicle of hate.”

“Erika Kirk is using her husband's death to promote Kirk's vehicle of hate, Turning Points USA. Fascinating to watch this right now,” the failed political commentator wrote on X. 

“Charlie Kirk was a horrible, hateful man who spent his life radicalizing young people to embrace their worst demons,” he added in another post. 

Social media is riddled with similar remarks from liberals who claim Kirk had his days counted. 

Other remarks, such as those made by Democratic activist Rebekah Jones, a former government employee in Florida and self-proclaimed “famed government whistleblower,” shifted the blame from the Left's hateful narrative to the conservative movement, inferring that the Left is the true victim of the murder of a conservative figure.  

CHARLIE KIRK MURDER REVEALS RADICALS IN ACADEMIA

“Save your sympathies for the innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire of MAGA's violent political messaging machine,” Jones wrote. 

These remarks have made it clear that the Left will not hold back on the opportunity to spin a tragedy into a message to recruit hate-filled members to its hate-filled movement. ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Cook v. Trump is one of the highest-stakes cases of Trump's presidency.

A long-simmering showdown over whether President Donald Trump may seize control over the Federal Reserve appears to be entering its endgame. It is highly likely that the Supreme Court will weigh in on this dispute either Monday evening or Tuesday.

If the Court does side with Trump, that would be one of the most consequential economic policy decisions in the federal judiciary's history. And it could potentially have disastrous consequences both for investors and for the US economy broadly.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

The Fed is one of several federal agencies that are labeled as “independent” from the president. Though the president chooses who will serve on the Fed's Board of Governors, these governors must be confirmed by the Senate, and they serve 14-year terms. By law, the president may only remove a member of the Fed's board “for cause,” unlike most agency leaders who serve at the pleasure of the president.

The Supreme Court's Republican majority, however, subscribes to a theory known as the “unitary executive,” which claims that it is unconstitutional for Congress to shield agency leaders from presidential control. If you care about the details of this theory, I've written more explainers on it than I can count, but the gist of it is that the Constitution places all “executive” power in the hands of the president. So any agency leader who wields authority that the Court deems to be “executive” in nature must be fireable at will by the president.

For most of the past two decades, the Republican justices have slowly expanded the president's power to fire officials under this theory. And they kicked this process into overdrive shortly after Trump took office for his second term. But, in a May decision, the Court did signal that it was spooked about giving Trump the authority to fire members of the Federal Reserve.

Although the Court's May decision in Trump v. Wilcox was cryptic, it's not hard to suss out why some of the justices feel torn between their loyalty to both Trump and the unitary executive theory on the one hand, and a desire to preserve Fed independence on the other.

The Fed essentially has the power to inject cocaine into the US economy. When the Fed lowers interest rates, it makes it easier for businesses to borrow money that they can use to begin new projects and hire new workers. But it also risks spiking inflation rates. Thus, if the president controls the Fed, he can engineer a short-term, politically advantageous boost to the economy — but at the cost of much greater economic turmoil down the road.

Nor is this concern merely hypothetical. In advance of his reelection bid in 1972, President Richard Nixon successfully pressured Fed chair Arthur Burns to lower interest rates. The economy boomed that year as a result, and Nixon won in an historic landslide. But Burns's capitulation is often blamed for years of “stagflation,” slow economic growth and high inflation, during the 1970s.

In any event, a lawsuit known as Cook v. Trump is now barreling toward the Supreme Court, and is likely to land on the justices' doorstep as soon as Monday night. Trump has asked the courts to weigh in on this case on an exceedingly expedited basis, in the hopes that he can gain the power to fire Federal Reserve governors in advance of an important Fed meeting that begins Tuesday.

As of this writing, Cook is pending before a federal appeals court. Trump asked that court to issue its decision “by the close of business on Monday, September 15, 2025.” If the appeals court does not comply, however, Trump will almost certainly attempt to bypass it and seek review from the Supreme Court in advance of the Tuesday Fed meeting.

So we are likely to find out very soon if the Court's Republican majority intends to place the Fed under Trump's control.

Last month, Trump attempted to fire Lisa Cook, a member of the Fed's Board of Governors who was appointed by President Joe Biden in 2022.

Trump claims he fired her because she allegedly committed mortgage fraud by claiming two separate properties as her principal residence — and thus he is firing her “for cause” — but this claim is an obvious pretext. Trump has raised similar allegations against several of his political foes, including Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James. And, in any event, the allegation against Cook was later revealed to be false.

Last week, Reuters reported that Cook declared one of the two properties as a “vacation home,” so the lender that helped her purchase that property was aware it was not her principal residence.

Nevertheless, Trump claims that he is allowed to fire Cook anyway. In briefs filed in a federal appeals court, Trump's lawyers argue that the president's false determination that Cook committed mortgage fraud “is not subject to judicial second-guessing,” and thus no court can prevent Trump from firing her based even on a transparently made-up pretext.

Under Trump's legal theory, he could have justified firing Cook “for cause” by accusing her of being responsible for the 1881 assassination of President James Garfield, or for causing the fall of Rome. Trump is asking the Court to neutralize the law protecting Fed governors from political firings in its entirety.

What stands in Trump's way is the Court's decision last May in Wilcox, which indicated that the Fed is exempt from the unitary executive theory, and that Trump may not fire its leaders at will.

Admittedly, the opinion in Wilcox was gobbledygook. It claimed that the Fed is special because it “is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States” — whatever that means. Numerous legal experts, including the Republican chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, have questioned whether there is actually a principled way to distinguish the Fed from other independent agencies.

Ultimately, however, the question of whether the Court's decision in Wilcox rests on a principled distinction is academic. This Court frequently hands down bizarre or incomprehensible decisions, and those decisions are no less binding than cases that rest on sound legal reasoning.

The important thing is that, just four months ago, this Court handed down a decision indicating that Trump cannot fire members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. If the Republican justices reverse course after such a recent decision, either by overruling Wilcox explicitly or by defining the term “for cause” so narrowly that it becomes meaningless, that wouldn't just have stunning implications for the US economy.

It would also be an unusually loud signal that this Court has decided to become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Trump Organization.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Mortgage regulator Bill Pulte has posted at least 13 agency orders on his personal X account","https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-pulte-fhfa-agency-orders-personal-x-account-2025-9","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 15:59:00 GMT","

Until he became the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and a warrior in President Trump's fight with the Federal Reserve, Bill Pulte was mostly known for posting on X. Under the handle @pulte, the businessman frequently sent groceries and gas money to people in need.

In his governmental role, which he assumed in March, Pulte has continued to use X as a megaphone. Over the last six months, he has posted at least 13 official orders on his personal account — and they don't appear to be posted publicly anywhere else.

The practice is unusual for the head of an agency that regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two housing-finance companies under federal conservatorship central to the $21 trillion residential mortgage market.

Under previous leaders, the FHFA hasn't followed a single standard for publishing orders. Some have appeared in the Federal Register or on the agency's website, while others were only circulated by email.

Former FHFA employees said they couldn't recall learning about orders on Twitter or social media before.

Former FHFA officials and a legal expert said publishing directives — including one instructing the companies to consider cryptocurrency assets in mortgage underwriting — on a personal social media account raised concerns about legality and how those inside and outside the industry are supposed to track changes that could affect lenders, investors, and tenants.

pic.twitter.com/O3x6a6vD0M

The orders, including two that roll back climate change and tenant protection requirements, don't appear to have been posted on any government websites. Some of the posts were previously reported by Inman, a housing industry publication.

The FHFA is not required to post all of its orders and policy directives online. Pulte said in an interview posted April 30 that he had already signed 80 orders. In the past, the agency has often drafted orders collaboratively and circulated them by email to relevant parties when they were finalized, said Victoria Nahrwold, a former senior official at the FHFA who retired in June.

Pulte's most recent post, from June, called on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider the value of a homebuyer's cryptocurrency when calculating their assets.

Pulte posted about what he described as an ""official government account"" back in May. He hasn't yet posted from it.

Janell Byrd-Chichester, the FHFA's chief of staff from 2014 to 2019, called Pulte's social-media use ""very bizarre"" and out of step with past practice. 

""It's so far off the radar about what activity is contemplated by government officials,"" said Byrd-Chichester, who is now the general counsel of the National Fair Housing Alliance.

Nahrwold said that while she worked at FHFA, she followed Pulte on X to learn about what was going on at the FHFA and the entities it regulated. ""If you didn't see it on social media, you wouldn't know,"" she said. At least some orders posted on X were also circulated by email, she said.

""This is very abnormal,"" said David Reiss, a law professor at Cornell University who focuses on housing policy and real-estate finance. ""I don't know what a court would do if someone sued based on an order that he only posted on X."" He added by email that impacted parties might argue that carrying out official acts by an X post doesn't comply with the Administrative Procedure Act.

The FHFA did not respond to questions about Pulte's posts. Pulte didn't respond to a request for comment.

Despite the relative obscurity of the FHFA — which was created by Congress in 2008 to be a stronger regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac amid a wave of mortgage defaults — Pulte catapulted to prominence in recent weeks after accusing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud.

The American Banker reported that his posts about Cook may violate the Privacy Act. Pulte said in a Bloomberg TV appearance that he only posted public information.

Pulte also owns a stake in X valued at between $1 million and $5 million, according to an official financial disclosure.

Though he deleted nearly all of his X posts after Trump was elected president in 2024, he eventually resumed posting at a rapid pace. He posted or reposted 33 times on September 5, for example, mostly to assail the president's political opponents, including Cook.

The orders that Pulte posted on X are hardly the biggest thing on FHFA's plate; the National Association of Realtors described some of them in a blog post as not creating any ""notable cost savings."" More important to observers of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and their regulator are the Trump administration's plans to sell part of the US Treasury's massive stake in the mortgage securitization companies.

The sale, if it goes through, could generate billions of dollars for the federal government. It could also derail efforts by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to grow a capital cushion that could be needed to avoid a bailout in a future major housing downturn.

U.S. and Chinese trade negotiations concluded in Spain Monday, after two days of talks on several sticking points ranging from tariff rates, export controls and the imminent deadline for a divestment of Chinese-owned TikTok.

Talks on trade were overshadowed by a ""framework"" deal regarding the social media platform, announced by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Monday.

""It's between two private parties, but the commercial terms have been agreed upon,"" he said from U.S.-China talks in Madrid. Both President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet Friday to discuss the terms.

The news comes ahead of a Wednesday deadline to either divest TikTok's U.S. business or shut down the social media app in the country.

Bessent led negotiations alongside Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on the U.S. side, with the Chinese represented by Vice Premier He Lifeng and top trade negotiator Li Chenggang.

There were no major developments in trade discussions, however, with Greer saying talks on ""those kinds of things"" had been ""deferred"" to another time. ""We were very focused on TikTok,"" he added.

The meetings in Madrid mark the fourth round of bilateral meetings in four months, after both sides reached an agreement in May to pause most of the steep tariffs and walk back some of their mutual restrictions. A trip to Washington by Chinese senior trade negotiator Li Chenggang last month yielded little progress.

Tensions between the countries have ramped up in recent days. Over the weekend, China launched two investigations targeting the U.S. semiconductor industry, including an anti-dumping probe relating to certain American-made analog IC chips, along with an anti-discrimination investigation into U.S. moves against the Chinese chip sector.

The investigations were kicked off after the U.S. added 23 more China-based companies to its entity list last Friday.

On Monday, China's market regulator said that a preliminary investigation found Nvidia was in violation of the country's anti-competition laws, adding that a further probe into the U.S. chip giant will be carried out.

After the end of the talks Monday, Bessent described the Nvidia investigation announcement as ""poor timing.""

Nvidia has become ""a leverage for both sides,"" with the extended probe as ""clearly part of negotiation tactics run by Beijing to show its tough side to Washington,"" said George Chen, partner of digital practice at business advisory The Asia Group.

The barbs exchanged ahead of the Madrid rapprochement were ""not encouraging,"" said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade representative and head of the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington, adding that China was ""going to drive a hard bargain"" in Trump's second mandate and likely demand some compensation in exchange for lifting these new measures.

Cutler pointed out that Beijing had managed to get Washington to remove certain controls on exports of tech equipment to China, after it tightened exports of critical minerals and magnets to the U.S.

""With this approach, [it's] hard to see how the bilateral economic relationship improves. More like running to [a] stand-still,"" Cutler said.

Separately, China's Ministry of Commerce in a statement pushed back against Trump's request for the European Union to impose secondary tariffs of up to 100% on China over the country's purchases of Russian oil.

This was ""a classic act of unilateral bullying and economic coercion"" and ""a severe violation of the consensus reached"" during a call between Trump and Xi earlier this year, a spokesperson for the ministry said in the statement, vowing to take ""any necessary measure"" to defend Beijing's legitimate interests.

Officials were also expected to discuss details of a potential face-to-face meeting between Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping later this year. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that Beijing has for the past two months sought to broker a Trump visit to China, what would be the U.S. president's first state visit to the country after a trip in 2017.

— CNBC's Evelyn Cheng and Samantha Subin contributed to the report.

SPECIAL REPORT: See The Most Trusted Financial Firms By Category



This options move can capitalize on further weakness in Strategy stock. (Adobe).

Investors piling into bitcoin play Strategy (MSTR) have faced disappointing results in recent months.

Although the company still operates a small software business, its primary function today is as a bitcoin treasury vehicle, with a strategy centered on continually accumulating bitcoin through debt issuance and equity offerings.

This approach has effectively turned Strategy – previously called MicroStrategy – into a leveraged bet on bitcoin.

 Cofounder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has promoted this strategy as a once-in-a-lifetime play on ""digital gold."" Despite his often bold claims, critics have had little traction while bitcoin remains near record highs — with the cryptocurrency hitting an all-time peak of over 124,000 on Aug. 14.

Yet despite bitcoin's strength, Strategy shares have significantly underperformed. The stock trades well below its late-November 2024 high of 543, hovering closer to 325 today.

The underperformance stems largely from the rapid expansion of bitcoin-related investment products, including spot bitcoin ETFs and options. The products give investors alternative ways to gain exposure without paying a premium for Strategy shares. More recently, the growth of other bitcoin treasury companies has intensified competition, further diluting Strategy's unique appeal.

As a result, the company's premium to net asset value, or NAV, of its bitcoin holdings has collapsed — sliding from over 300% to just above 40%.

For investors who expect this trend to continue, a put option offers a way to capitalize on further weakness.

With shares of Strategy trading around 325 on Monday, investors can consider buying the 320 put option with an expiration of Oct. 17.

 This put option currently costs around $17 per contract, equating to a maximum loss on the trade of $1,700, should shares remain above 320 on expiration. This trade will break even if Strategy stock trades at 303 on expiration. In the event of the rapid decline in share prices, the maximum profit could be many multiples of the original premium paid. 

Unlike shorting shares, this put option limits the risk to the debit paid, allowing investors superior risk management. The key to a put option here is also muted volatility. 

Strategy's October options have an implied volatility of 51%. While that is in line with recent realized volatility, it is well below the stock's historical annualized volatility, which has averaged around 80%.

Shares of Strategy are currently trading below both their 50-day and 200-day lines. The stock has continued to underperform bitcoin recently, falling 11% over the past month vs. just a 2% decline in the iShares Bitcoin (IBIT) exchange traded fund over that same time.

Oops, something went wrong

BitMine Immersion Technologies Inc (AMEX:BMNR) has amassed over 2.15 million ETH tokens worth approximately $10 billion, cementing its position as the world's largest Ethereum (CRYPOT: ETH) treasury company.

What Happened: The company's total crypto and cash holdings reached $10.771 billion as of Sep. 14, including 2,151,676 ETH, 192 Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), $214 million in “moonshot” investments and $569 million in unencumbered cash.

This positions BitMine as the second-largest global crypto treasury behind Strategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), which holds $74 billion worth of Bitcoin.

“BitMine has nearly $11 billion in total crypto holdings, surpassing the 2 million ETH milestone,” said Chairman Tom Lee, referencing the company's pursuit of acquiring 5% of Ethereum's total supply.

Lee emphasized that “the power law benefits large holders of ETH, hence, we pursue the ‘alchemy of 5%' of ETH.”

Why It Matters: The announcement comes as digital asset investment products experienced $3.3 billion in inflows last week, according to CoinShares data, pushing total assets under management to $239 billion near August's record high.

Ethereum particularly benefited from renewed investor interest, recording $646 million in inflows after eight consecutive days of outflows.

The positive sentiment extended across digital assets, with Bitcoin attracting $2.4 billion in weekly inflows and Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) recording its largest-ever single-day inflow of $145 million on Friday.

This broad-based recovery followed weaker-than-expected U.S. macroeconomic data and end-of-week price gains across digital assets.

What's Next: BitMine's strategy centers on Lee's thesis that Wall Street's migration to blockchain infrastructure will primarily occur on Ethereum.

“We continue to believe Ethereum is one of the biggest macro trades over the next 10-15 years,” Lee said.

“Wall Street and AI moving onto the blockchain should lead to a greater transformation of today's financial system. And the majority of this is taking place on Ethereum.”

About us

Stripe's head of crypto John Egan has jumped ship for Polygon Labs, less than a month after the payments giant announced its highly-anticipated Tempo blockchain. 

Egan joins the firm as its first chief product officer, where he will work directly under CEO Marc Boiron. In the new role he will advance Polygon's capacity as a stablecoin payments blockchain, helping increase adoption, scalability, and interoperability, according to information shared with DL News.

It's not clear why Egan decided to leave Stripe just as the firm prepares to launch Tempo, which will compete with Polygon in the stablecoin payments sector. 

Egan said in a statement that he and Polygon Labs have “a clear opportunity to make Polygon the leader in global blockchain payments.”

Egan did not respond to a request for comment. 

His move comes at a crucial time for the crypto industry. 

The Trump administration's pro-industry tilt has incentivised both native firms and traditional financial firms to ramp up their digital asset strategies.

Stablecoins play a key role in those efforts after President Donald Trump signed the Genius Act into law in July and legitimised crypto tokens designed to trade at parity with the dollar after years of uncertainty.

Not only are blockchain protocols like Hyperliquid working on their own stablecoins, but banking giants like Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo are also reportedly exploring launching their own stablecoins.

Enter Tempo. Unveiled on September 4, it is a new blockchain specifically designed for stablecoin payments. It is incubated by Stripe and crypto venture firm Paradigm but will operate as a standalone company. 

Polygon was originally launched in 2020 as a way to scale the Ethereum blockchain. It initially soared in popularity but has since been eclipsed by other Ethereum-compatible blockchains, such as Arbitrum and Coinbase's Base. 

In recent months, Polygon has found a new lease of life in stablecoin payments. Since the start of the year, the monthly volume of peer-to-peer stablecoin transactions on the blockchain has grown almost 40%.

There are almost $3 billion stablecoins on Polygon, close to the record for the blockchain, according to DefiLlama data.

Egan joined Stripe in 2023, and was key to the firm's push to integrate blockchain technology into its payments infrastructure.

He oversaw the firm's $1.1 billion February acquisition of Bridge, a stablecoin infrastructure platform, and the acquisition of crypto wallet provider Privy in June. 

Before joining Stripe, Egan spent several years at Meta, formerly Facebook, and also founded multiple companies, including Caffeinated Mind, which was acquired by Facebook, blockchain art platform Editional, and incident management company Kintaba.

“As we push Polygon to become the foundation for digital payments, we need someone who's proven they can bridge between what's technically possible and what users most need,” Marc Boiron, CEO of Polygon Labs, said in a statement. 

“John's that rare leader who's done it repeatedly,” he said.

In a surprising revelation that underscores the evolving challenges in educational cybersecurity, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has issued a stark warning about an unexpected source of data breaches: the students themselves. According to recent findings, over half of the cyber incidents reported in schools and colleges stem from pupils hacking into their own institutions' IT systems, often driven by curiosity, dares, or simply for fun. This trend, which has surged since 2022, highlights a critical “insider threat” that educators and IT administrators have largely underestimated.

The ICO's analysis, based on hundreds of incidents, reveals that children as young as seven are involved in these breaches, using tactics ranging from guessing passwords to deploying more sophisticated hacking tools. These actions not only expose sensitive personal data but also disrupt school operations, leading to potential long-term consequences for the young perpetrators. As TechSpot reported, the watchdog is urging schools to bolster their defenses and educate students on the risks of such behavior, emphasizing that what starts as playful experimentation could lead to a path of cybercrime.

Rising Incidents and Underlying Causes

Delving deeper, the ICO's report indicates a 57% involvement rate of students in these hacks, with motives varying from altering grades to accessing restricted content. This insider dynamic complicates traditional cybersecurity strategies, which typically focus on external threats like ransomware or phishing. Publications such as PublicTechnology have noted that the ease of access granted to students via school-issued devices exacerbates the issue, turning trusted users into potential vulnerabilities.

Industry experts point out that the proliferation of digital tools in education, accelerated by the pandemic, has inadvertently created fertile ground for such activities. Schools often lack robust monitoring systems, and students, growing up in a tech-saturated environment, possess skills that outpace outdated security measures. As detailed in WebProNews, over 215 incidents have been logged since 2022, prompting calls for enhanced training and awareness programs to mitigate these risks without stifling technological integration.

Implications for Educational Institutions

For school administrators and IT professionals, this warning serves as a wake-up call to reassess internal security protocols. Implementing multi-factor authentication, regular password audits, and student education on ethical hacking could curb these breaches. The ICO advises treating students not just as learners but as potential actors in the security ecosystem, fostering a culture of responsibility. Insights from TechRound suggest that ignoring this trend could lead to broader data privacy issues, affecting compliance with regulations like the GDPR.

Moreover, the psychological aspect cannot be overlooked. Many of these hacks are born out of boredom or peer pressure, as echoed in reports from Security Affairs, which highlight how children's natural curiosity intersects with advanced tech access. Schools must balance discipline with guidance, perhaps channeling this energy into positive outlets like cybersecurity clubs or ethical hacking workshops.

Broader Industry Ramifications

Beyond the UK, this phenomenon raises questions for global education sectors grappling with similar digital transformations. Cybersecurity firms are now tailoring solutions for educational environments, incorporating AI-driven monitoring to detect anomalous student behavior. As ITV News covered, the ICO's findings could influence policy, pushing for mandatory cybersecurity curricula in schools to preemptively address these threats.

Ultimately, the ICO's alert, as amplified by Infosecurity Magazine, warns that without proactive measures, these student-led breaches could escalate, potentially setting young individuals on a trajectory toward more serious cyber offenses. For industry insiders, this underscores the need for adaptive strategies that evolve with the ingenuity of the next generation, ensuring that education remains a safe space for innovation rather than exploitation.

Payments firm PayPal (PYPL) said it is expanding its peer-to-peer service by adding cryptocurrency transfers to its payment flow, the company announced on Monday.

Users in the U.S. will soon be able to send bitcoin BTC$115,432.42, ether (ETH), PayPal's dollar stablecoin PYUSD and other digital assets across PayPal, Venmo and an increasing number of crypto-compatible wallets worldwide, the firm said in a Monday press release.

The integration arrives alongside ""PayPal links,"" a new tool that lets users generate a one-time personalized link to send or request money. The links can be dropped into text messages, chats or email, embedding payments into everyday conversations.

Personal transfers between friends and family will remain exempt from IRS 1099-K tax reporting requirements, meaning gifts, reimbursements and shared expenses won't generate tax forms even if crypto is involved in the transaction, the firm said.

The company said the move builds on ""PayPal World,"" its new interoperability initiative aimed at connecting the largest digital wallets and payment systems. Peer-to-peer payments are a key growth driver, with consumer payment volume climbing 10% in the second quarter year-over-year. In July, the firm said to expand crypto payments for U.S. merchants as part of its deeper push into global digital currency payments.

Key Takeaways

For years, blockchain technology has promised to change the way in which the internet operates – decentralized, immutable and transparent.

But for all its potential, a fundamental drawback has prevented widespread adoption by businesses: transparency often means a complete lack of privacy.

The global blockchain market is projected to reach USD 248.9 billion by 2029, as venture capital continues to pour into blockchain projects .

The hard truth, however, is that for highly regulated industries like healthcare and finance, privacy isn't a nice-to-have; it's a legal and ethical requirement.

Until blockchain can meet that standard, it will remain confined to pilot projects and niche applications.

Privacy-enhancing technologies address a lot of the concerns around privacy in blockchain, but they often carry steep trade-offs in the form of high compute costs, slower performance, and complex integration.

No enterprise wants all of its data, supplier relationships, spending patterns, and inventory levels to be available to the world. In healthcare specifically, privacy is non-negotiable.

Regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR mandate strict protection of patient data. The idea of storing a patient's medical history on a fully transparent ledger is a non-starter.

Additionally, publishing operational or personal information to an immutable public ledger also conflicts with some privacy laws, especially GDPR's “right to be forgotten.”

In blockchain, what goes on-chain stays on-chain. Even pseudonymised records can be deanonymised when cross-referenced with other datasets, exposing individuals or businesses to potential risk.

Emerging technologies like zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), multiparty computation, and ring signatures can provide confidentiality, but they still face limitations in performance and ease of use.

One promising technology is Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). It allows computations on encrypted data without ever decrypting it.

This means a bank, for example, could settle transactions on a shared blockchain while hiding actual numbers, or a healthcare provider could let a specialist analyse encrypted patient records without exposing sensitive information.

FHE has the potential to address blockchain's privacy-transparency divide, enabling sensitive industries to benefit from decentralization without sacrificing confidentiality.

In finance, it could support secure trading, risk analysis, and compliance checks. In healthcare, it could also enable collaborative research without sharing any patient data.

However, despite its promise, FHE remains far from widespread adoption. The computational power required is significant, and often slower than handling unencrypted data, making high-volume, real-time applications a challenge for enterprises.

Standardized tools are also scarce, and integration usually requires specific cryptographic expertise.

To solve the transparency problem in blockchain, advances in PETs efficiency and dedicated hardware for technologies like FHE will be essential.

Standardization across the industry will play an equally critical role, providing common protocols and toolkits that make integration into existing systems and blockchain platforms far easier.

Regulatory clarity is also necessary, with recognition of FHE as a solution that complies with existing regulations.

Alongside these developments, deployment projects that demonstrate measurable returns while maintaining security and compliance will be key to proving its value and driving mass adoption across different industries.

Blockchain must not force a choice between transparency and confidentiality. With innovative technologies like FHE, we could finally realise blockchain's full potential and create a resilient, decentralized infrastructure that safeguards even the most sensitive data.

If we bridge the gap between the transparency of distributed ledgers and the privacy enterprises and industries handling sensitive data demand, blockchain can evolve from a niche tool into the backbone of a secure, global digital economy.

The technology is here. The challenge is making it efficient, simple, and scalable enough for the industries that need it most.

The first exchange-traded fund (ETF) built around a meme coin could hit the market this week, after multiple delays and much speculation.



The DOGE ETF — formally called the Rex Shares-Osprey Dogecoin ETF (DOJE) — was originally slated to debut last week, alongside a handful of politically themed and crypto-related ETFs. Those included funds tied to Bonk BONK$0.0₄2313, XRP, Bitcoin BTC$115,432.42 and even a Trump-themed fund. But DOJE's debut never materialized.



Now, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart believe Wednesday is the most likely launch date, though they caution nothing is certain.



“It's more likely than not,” Seyffart said. “That seems like the base case.”



Ahead of the introduction of the ETF, DOGE has been among the top performers over the past month, ahead 15% even including a decline of 3.5% over the past 24 horus.



If launched, DOJE would mark a milestone as the first U.S. ETF to focus on a meme coin — cryptocurrencies that generally lack utility or a clear economic purpose. These include tokens like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu SHIB$0.0₄1301 and Bonk, which often surge in popularity thanks to internet culture, celebrity endorsements and speculative trading.



Balchunas described DOJE's significance in a post on X: “First-ever US ETF to hold something that has no utility on purpose.”



DOJE is not a spot ETF. That means it won't hold DOGE directly. Instead, the fund will use a Cayman Islands-based subsidiary to gain exposure through futures and other derivatives. This approach sidesteps the need for physical custody of the coin while still offering traders a way to bet on its performance within a traditional brokerage account.



The ETF was approved earlier this month under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which is typically used for mutual funds and diversified ETFs. That sets it apart from the wave of bitcoin ETFs that received green lights under the Securities Act of 1933, a framework used for commodity-based and asset-backed products. In short, DOJE is structured more like a mutual fund than a commodity trust.



More direct exposure may be coming soon. Several firms have filed applications to launch spot DOGE ETFs, which would hold the meme coin itself rather than derivatives. These applications are still under review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has grown more comfortable with crypto ETFs since approving a slate of bitcoin products in early 2024.



The broader crypto market has shown that investor demand can outweigh fundamental critiques. Meme coins have long drawn skepticism for having no underlying value or use case, but that hasn't kept them from drawing billions in speculative capital.



Seyffart said the ETF market is likely to follow the same path. “There's going to be a bunch of products like this, whether you love it or need it, they're going to be coming to market,” he said.



He added that many existing financial products serve no deeper purpose than providing a vehicle for short-term bets. “There's plenty of products out there that are just being used as gambling or short-term trading,” he said. “So if there's an audience for this in the crypto world, I wouldn't be surprised at all if this finds an audience in the ETF and TradFi world.”



Whether the DOJE ETF opens the door to more meme coin funds — or just proves the concept is viable — may depend on how the market responds this week. Either way, it signals a new phase in the merging of internet culture and traditional finance.

Death Rates from Chronic Diseases Dropped in Most Countries

A report finds that death rates from cancer and heart disease have declined since 2010 in roughly 150 countries. Experts explain potential reasons why

The chance of dying from chronic illnesses such as heart disease, cancer and diabetes declined in four out of five countries between 2010 and 2019, finds a study of 185 countries published in The Lancet today.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of death globally. The United Nations has set the goal of reducing deaths from these diseases by one-third by 2030.

The latest study is the first to investigate the change in NCD mortality across countries. It finds that, from 2010 to 2019, the probability of dying from an NCD before the age of 80 fell in 152 countries for women and in 147 countries for men.

Despite these gains, more than half of the countries saw slower declines in the 2010s compared with the previous decade. “Around the beginning of the millennium, we saw significantly lowered mortality rates, but despite political attention suddenly over the last decade, things are not doing as well as before,” says Majid Ezzati, a co-author and global-health researcher at Imperial College London.

In 2019, women in Japan and men in Singapore had the lowest risk of dying from a NCD among the countries studied, while women in Afghanistan and men in Eswatini had the highest (see ‘Risk of dying from chronic disease').

Nature; Source: “Benchmarking Progress in Non-Communicable Diseases: A Global Analysis of Cause-Specific Mortality from 2001 to 2019,” by James E. Bennett et al., in The Lancet; Published online September 10, 2025 (data)

All 25 high-income countries in the data set saw declines in NCD mortality between 2010 and 2019, with Denmark recording the largest drop for both sexes and the United States the smallest (see ‘Most and least improved'). China, Egypt, Nigeria, Russia and Brazil had a reduction in chronic-disease deaths, whereas India and Papua New Guinea experienced an increase in NCD deaths over the same period.

Veronica Le Nevez, a public-policy specialist at the George Institute for Global Health in Sydney, Australia, says that the report finds the biggest drivers of improvements in death rates were embedding better treatments and preventions in health-care systems, the widespread adoption of statins and hypertensives to lower the risk of heart attack and stroke and the development of vaccines for hepatitis and cervical cancer.

Government restrictions on tobacco and alcohol have also helped to reduce mortality from diseases linked to their use, such as lung cancer and alcohol-use disorder.

Ezzati says that the slowdown between 2010 and 2019 could be because of underfunding, poor targeting of vulnerable populations and a lack of clarity in public-health priorities. In many countries, proven interventions to reduce chronic-disease deaths, such as treatment for high-blood pressure and diabetes and cancer screening, have stagnated or even declined since 2010, despite being low-cost and highly effective, he says. Government restrictions on tobacco and alcohol have also lost momentum in many regions, he adds.

“It is disappointing to note that liver cancer contributed towards higher NCD mortality in most countries despite the strong evidence base and availability of alcohol-control policies,” says Naomi Gibbs, a health economist at University of York, UK.

High-income countries such as the United States and Germany saw a decline in improvements because of a rise in neuropsychiatric conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, other dementias and alcohol-use disorders. “Mortality from Alzheimer's disease and dementias increased in 65% of countries, and in 90% of high-income countries,” says Le Nevez. Accelerated funding and the implementation of programmes addressing these conditions is needed urgently, she adds.

Le Nevez notes that the study looked only at mortality, but many people live with an NCD, and often with more than one chronic condition, for many years. “We need to also consider how to live well with chronic disease,” she says.

Dry eyes can cause significant discomfort, and the symptoms become more common as we age. However, until now, it was unclear what proportion of the population suffered from the condition, with estimates ranging from 5-50%.

In fact, research presented today (September 15) at the 43rd Congress of the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ESCRS) [1], found that more than half of the general population in the USA and Europe experience dry eyes, yet only 20% of European patients and 17% of US patients were diagnosed, and they can wait years for professional help.

Dr Piotr Wozniak, refractive surgeon and dry eye specialist at Optegra Eye Clinics in Warsaw, Poland, and a lecturer and clinical instructor at Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University in Warsaw, told the Congress: ""Results from our studies reveal a substantial group of patients suffering without help. The European questionnaire explored why people don't seek treatment. Many see dry eye as a normal part of aging and something to endure. As a medical doctor, I find this particularly concerning because a simple eye drop could offer significant relief - but many people aren't even asking for help.""

Dr Wozniak presented findings from a survey of 2,003 adults in the US conducted in April 2024, and from an ongoing, international arm of the study conducted by Bausch and Lomb with over 5,000 adults in the UK, France, Germany, Poland, and Saudi Arabia: the 'Needs Unmet in Dry Eye: Symptoms, Treatment and Severity' (NESTS) study. In June 2025, the NESTS international arm surveyed 2,580 adults in the general population and 2,572 dry eye sufferers [2].

""In the NESTS study, we found that 58% of the general population reported experiencing dry eye symptoms, yet only one in five have received a formal diagnosis from a healthcare provider,"" he said. ""The large size of this study makes these results robust.

""The study explored the patient journey in detail. What stood out was that up to one-third of patients had experienced symptoms for more than five years before seeking professional help. NESTS also found that around half of sufferers experience symptoms every single day. The delay in seeking treatment is concerning, especially since dry eye is a progressive disease and early intervention can prevent a vicious cycle of inflammation.""

Other results from NESTS showed that 60% of dry eye sufferers waited at least four months before seeking help and 20% waited more than a year before talking to health care provider about their symptoms. Many sufferers stopped driving at night (17%), no longer wore makeup (14.8%), or reduced their use of heat or air conditioning (15.2%) due to their uncontrolled dry eye symptoms. One in three sufferers (34%) reported that their symptoms had worsened in the past year and only 9% said there had been an improvement.

Lubricating eye drops were the first and most common treatment, chosen either by the patient or by an eye or health care provider. Yet only 25% believed their current treatment was specifically tailored to their needs.

Dr Wozniak said: ""NESTS also examined patient-provider interactions, revealing national differences. For example, in France fewer than half of dry eye sufferers had planned follow-up visits, while in Saudi Arabia, the majority, 84%, were proactively followed up by their providers.""

In the US study, eye dryness frequently affected 50% of survey respondents, and 80% experienced symptoms such as fatigue, itchy or watery eyes, but only 17% had a diagnosis from an eye care provider. Between 35-75% of people were very or extremely bothered by dry eyes, with reading, using electronic devices or driving being the most common activities to be disrupted; 70% lacked knowledge of treatment options; 40% were unaware that untreated dry eyes can cause other eye problems and vision loss; only about 25% visited an eye care provider every two years or more frequently; 67% of people with dry eyes waited six months or more to see an eye care provider, and 31% waited two or more years.

Dr Wozniak said: ""These findings highlight the widespread impact of dry eye disease on quality of life, showing a large number of people suffering silently.

""We need to educate patients and the public on the causes, consequences and treatment options for dry eyes, as well as the importance of regular eye checks. In addition, we must support healthcare professionals in distinguishing between different types of dry eye and matching treatments appropriately. One person's 'dry eye' can be very different from another's.""

Diagnosis of dry eye often involves a combination of patient-reported symptoms, medical history and clinical tests. However, some patients are diagnosed only on the basis of symptoms and a standard eye examination, for instance with a microscope. Specific diagnostic tools include looking at the time it takes for a dry spot to appear on the cornea after a blink, using dye to stain the surface of the eye, measuring the concentrations of salts and other particles in tears, or an assessment of the Meibomian gland, which is responsible for producing the oily part of tears.

Left untreated, dry eyes can be very uncomfortable, can cause inflammation and a condition called blepharitis when eyelids become sore and inflamed. Symptoms include a sandy or gritty feeling, soreness, uncomfortable and painful eyes, itching or burning sensation, short-term blurred vision, and watery eyes. Dry eyes are more common in people over the age of 50 because the glands that make tears, particularly the oily component, become less effective, causing the tears to dry up too quickly and the front of the eye to become dry and irritated. The condition may also affect the outcome of nearly every ophthalmological surgery, including cataract and refractive procedures, making its diagnosis and management important, even before surgery takes place.

Dry, dusty, windy and cold conditions can also make eyes feel dry, as can air-conditioning, central heating, smoking and certain medical conditions such as autoimmune diseases and hormonal conditions.

ESCRS President, Dr Filomena Ribeiro, who is Head of the Ophthalmology Department at Hospital da Luz, Lisbon, Portugal, was not involved in the research. She commented: ""These findings reveal the true extent of dry eye disease in the general population. It is concerning that such a small proportion of sufferers seek help for the condition, especially as it can make a real difference to the outcomes of ophthalmological surgery and also to their quality of life. Eye and health care professionals need to discuss this with patients when they see them and encourage people to have regular eye care checks.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Who are the Papua New Guineans? New DNA study reveals stunning origins","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250914205853.htm","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 13:26:24 GMT","

Papua New Guineans are living proof of how isolation, ancient mixing, and survival in remote islands can preserve a unique piece of our shared human story.

A team of European researchers has shed new light on the genetic origins of Papua New Guineans. The team uses advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to demonstrate that Papua New Guineans are closely related to other Asian populations. They share a common ancestry from the same 'Out of Africa' event that also gave rise to other non-African groups.

Papua New Guineans look strikingly different from other Asian groups and share some features with Sub-Saharan African populations, which fueled theories that they might have descended separately from other non-African populations.

According to lead author Dr. Mayukh Mondal, the unique physical features of Papua New Guineans probably come from natural selection: ""Perhaps adaptations to tropical climates that make them look more like Sub-Saharan African groups, even though their genetics clearly link them to other Asian populations. More studies are needed to uncover how evolution shaped this remarkable population.""

The genetic origin remains unresolved

Scientists generally agree that modern humans left Africa about 50,000 to 70,000 years ago, spreading into Europe, Asia, and beyond. Early archaeological studies have suggested that the ancestors of Papua New Guineans came from a separate, earlier migration (also known as the 'First Out of Africa' hypothesis), taking a coastal route through India and Southeast Asia. Archaeological evidence confirms that some of the Papuan New Guineans' genetic ancestry could have come from this 'First out of Africa' event. This is because the earliest human site in Oceania dates back to around 50,000 -- 60,000 years ago, older than Europe's oldest sites.

In recent decades, advances in DNA sequencing have tested this 'First out of Africa' hypothesis. However, studies of maternal (mitochondrial) and paternal (Y-chromosome) DNA have found no clear evidence that the main ancestry of Papua New Guineans came from an earlier migration. Instead, analyses suggest that their lineages connect to other non-African populations. Still, we cannot rule out a trace number of ancient migrations from the 'First out of Africa' population.

Interestingly, the Papua New Guinean genome carries a significant percentage of Denisovan DNA -- a ghostly relative of Neanderthals. This unique inheritance likely came from mixing with Denisovans in Southeast Asia or Oceania -- another element that confirms the complexity of Papua New Guinean ancestry.

Despite these researches, the genetic origin of Papuan New Guineans remains unresolved. Did Papua New Guineans split off before Europeans and Asians? Or have similar populations contributed to their genome? Did they carry ancestry from the enigmatic 'First out of Africa' population? Or are they part of the same family tree as other Asians living in proximity?

Unique demographic history

In this study, scientists used high-quality genomic data and AI-powered models to compare different demographic scenarios for the origin of the Papuan New Guineans' genetic diversity. Their results suggest that Papua New Guineans are a sister group to other Asian populations. Contribution from a 'First Out of Africa' migration might not be needed to explain their origins.

The researchers found that the ancestors of Papuan New Guineans went through a dramatic population bottleneck -- most likely their numbers dropped sharply after reaching Papua New Guinea and stayed low for thousands of years. Unlike other non-African groups, they did not experience the farming-driven population boom that reshaped Europe and Asia. This unique demographic history left genetic signatures that, if misunderstood, could look like evidence of a contribution from an unknown population.

‘God's influencer' Carlo Acutis was canonized on 7 September by Pope Leo XIV. Acutis was known for his use of digital media to promote Catholic devotion.Credit: Vatican Pool/Getty

The canonization of Carlo Acutis by Pope Leo XIV on 7 September was a sign of how the Catholic Church is increasingly embracing the digital world.

Acutis, who died of leukaemia in 2006 at the age of 15, was known for using the Internet to further his faith, maintaining a website documenting Eucharistic miracles recognized by the church. It earned him the moniker God's influencer.

But the work of a saintly teenage tech-wizard is just one way that new technologies are finding their way into religious practice: artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots and ritual-performing robots are already taking on spiritual roles that are conventionally filled by humans. Worshippers have mixed feelings about them.

The rise of generative AI chatbots has led to the creation of tools that purport to offer people the opportunity to speak directly with religious figures, such as Jesus Christ. Anné Verhoef, a philosopher at North-West University in Potchefstroom, South Africa, analysed five popular Jesus chatbots by asking them questions about themselves and basic theology, and found some worrying trends.

None of the chatbots he studied were developed or endorsed by any church, and it is not clear what religious texts they were trained on. Four of the five were created and managed by private companies — with names such as Catloaf Software, a mobile-development company in Los Angeles, California — whereas the fifth is run by a Christian group in South Korea with no official connection to any church. All are free but supported by advertisements, with one offering an ad-free premium subscription.

“It's difficult to know if they are really about religion, or just milking money from the faithful,” says Verhoef.

Another concern is that most religious AI bots claim to be Jesus rather than an AI impersonation developed by humans. “If this is really about Christianity and being sincere about faith, they should not be pretending to be God,” he says. “The possibility for abuse is huge” — if people believe a chatbot is actually divine, they might be convinced to follow its instructions for nefarious purposes, Verhoef says.



Jesus chatbots are growing in popularity and have hundreds of thousands of users, Verhoef estimates. The AI technology is also being used in more official capacities. Last year, as part of an experiment with a local university, a Catholic church in Lucerne, Switzerland, installed a Jesus chatbot in its confessional booth that could answer theological questions and offer spiritual guidance. In 2023, hundreds of Lutherans in Nuremberg, Germany, attended a church service generated and delivered by chatbot ChatGPT. Both were reasonably well-received, says Verhoef. Many of the functions of a priest could be replaced by AI chatbots in the future, but he sees a problem with it.

“If a sermon is prepared by an AI not a person, how seriously can we take that as a spiritually inspired sermon or thought?” asks Verhoef.

Christianity isn't the only religion using generative AI tools. There are also Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish and Islamic chatbots, but some religions are more open to adopting new technologies than are others, and for different uses. Hinduism and Buddhism, for example, already incorporate some simple forms of automation in their rituals. Some temples in India have begun using robotic arms to perform the Hindu aarti ritual, in which a devotee offers an oil lamp to the deity to symbolize the removal of darkness, and one temple in Kerala has an AI-driven animatronic elephant.

AMPA-type glutamate receptors, fundamental ion channels for fast excitatory neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity, contain a GluA tetrameric core surrounded by auxiliary proteins such as transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) or Cornichons. Their exact composition and stoichiometry govern functional properties, including kinetics, calcium permeability and trafficking. The GluA1–GluA3 subunits predominate in the adult forebrain and are well characterized. However, we lack structural information on full-length GluA4-containing AMPARs, a subtype that has specific roles in brain development and specific cell types in mammals. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structures of rat GluA4:TARP-γ2 trapped in active, resting and desensitized states, covering a full gating cycle. Additionally, we describe the structure of GluA4 alone, which displays a classical Y-shaped conformation. In resting conditions, GluA4:TARP-γ2 adopts two conformations, one resembling the desensitized states of other GluA subunits. Moreover, we identify a regulatory site for TARP-γ2 in the ligand-binding domain that modulates gating kinetics. Our findings uncover distinct features of GluA4, highlighting how subunit composition and auxiliary proteins shape receptor structure and dynamics, expanding glutamatergic signaling diversity.

a, Cryo-EM data processing workflow of GluA4rest, from movie processing to 3D maps. Processing steps were carried out with Relion 4.1 (black) or CryoSPARC (blue). Squared maps correspond to the final maps used for modeling, obtained with Relion PostProcess. b, Left: A stain-free SDS-PAGE gel displaying a band corresponding to purified GluA4 sample at approximately 100 kDa. Right: Motion-corrected micrograph (defocus value -1.7 μm). For the selection of the micrograph, we automatically selected all the micrographs with defocus values between -1.7 to -2.1 μm and selected a micrograph with intermediate density of particles, as depending on ice thickness we obtain some micrographs with denser or more sparse particle distribution. The density of particles on micrographs varied with ice thickness, with micrographs in thin ice presenting a denser particle distribution and micrographs in thick ice presenting less particles. Scale bar corresponds to 50 nm. c, Representative 2D class averages obtained with the particles of the final refined model (59,714 particles). The 2D classes excluded correspond to noisy classes due to a reduced number of particles (the selected 16 classes correspond to 56,319 particles). d, Particle distribution of the TMD/LBD final map.

In yellow, the distance between opposing Ala687 residues is highlighted (Ala665 in GluA2).

a, Left: Motion-corrected micrograph (defocus value -1.8 μm). For the selection of the micrograph, we automatically selected all the micrographs with defocus values between -1.7 to -2.1 μm and selected a micrograph with intermediate density of particles, as depending on ice thickness we obtain some micrographs with denser or more sparse particle distribution. Scale bar corresponds to 50 nm. Right: A stain-free SDS-PAGE gel displaying a band corresponding to purified GluA4:γ2 at approximately 130 kDa. b, 2D class averages obtained with the subset of particles from GluA4:γ2rest class I (top) and class II (bottom). For Class I, the 296,802 particles in class I were imported into Relion for 2D classification. All the main 2D orientations are included, and excluded classes correspond to more top views or particles with a reduced number of particles. For Class II, the 266,467 particles of Class II were imported into relion for 2D classification. The classes represent all the views, with aditional top views excluded. c, Particle distribution of the final TMD/LBD maps corresponding to class I and class II. d, Cryo-EM data processing workflow of GluA4:γ2rest, from movie processing to 3D maps.

GluA4:γ2 and WT GluA2:γ2 are palmitoylated (or their cryo-EM maps contain densities compatible with palmitoylation) and, consequently, the C-terminal of helix M4 is displaced towards TARP.

a, b, Comparison of currents elicited by Glutamate (black), CNQX (blue) and NBQX (cyan). As expected, NBQX does not elicit currents. c, Average of representative peak responses to rapid 1 ms applications of 10 mM glutamate recorded from outside-out patches of HEK293T cells expressing GluA2:γ2, in the absence (left trace) or presence (right trace) of 50 μM cyclothiazide (CTZ). Note that, in the CTZ condition, the patches were jumped from a control solution containing CTZ to a glutamate solution containing the same concentration of CTZ. d, Same as in c, but for GluA4:γ2, where an enhancement of the response is clearly observed (124% of the amplitude measured in the presence of CTZ in this example). e, Pooled data showing the effect of CTZ on peak response amplitude. Box-and-whisker plots indicate the median (line), 25–75th percentiles (box), and minimum–maximum values (whiskers); crosses denote the mean.

Although a reduction of protein expression is observed, the GluA4 5Cys variant expression is adequate for crosslinking experiments. The expression of these variants was evaluated in two independent experiments. g, top view of the LBD layer with the position of the interface cysteines S751C and S698C, represented as yellow spheres. Note that the native cysteines involved in disulfide bonds are also presented as spheres. h-j, Western blots of the cysteine mutants obtained in non-reducing conditions in resting (NBQX), desensitized (L-Glu) and open (CTZ + L-Glu) conditions. Note that S751C forms dimers in all conditions, as a result of its position in the LBD dimer interface. The introduction of two cysteines generates high molecular weight oligomers, which are enhanced in desensitizing conditions. For the cross-linking experiments conducted in the presence of NBQX or CTZ and L-Glutamate, the amount sample loaded for the double mutant was twice that of the single mutants and wild-type. In contrast, for the cross-linking performed in the presence of L-Glutamate alone, equal amounts of all samples were loaded onto the gel. Each crosslinking experiment was performed at least three times. Below each gel, the relevant 2D class averages representing classes with two dimeric LBDs and classes with one ruptured LBD are shown.

More than 200 contractors who worked on evaluating and improving Google's AI products have been laid off without warning in at least two rounds of layoffs last month. The move comes amid an ongoing fight over pay and working conditions, according to workers who spoke to WIRED.

In the past few years, Google has outsourced its AI rating work—which includes evaluating, editing, or rewriting the Gemini chatbot's response to make it sound more human and “intelligent”—to thousands of contractors employed by Hitachi-owned GlobalLogic and other outsourcing companies. Most raters working at GlobalLogic are based in the US and deal with English-language content. Just as content moderators help purge and classify content on social media, these workers use their expertise, skill, and judgment to teach chatbots and other AI products, including Google's search summaries feature called AI Overviews—the right responses on a wide range of subjects. Workers allege that the latest cuts come amid attempts to quash their protests over issues including pay and job insecurity.

These workers, who often are hired because of their specialist knowledge, had to have either a master's or a PhD to join the super rater program, and typically include writers, teachers, and people from creative fields.

“I was just cut off,” says Andrew Lauzon, who received an email with the news of his termination on August 15. “I asked for a reason, and they said ramp-down on the project—whatever that means.” He joined GlobalLogic in March 2024, where his work ranged from rating AI outputs to coming up with a variety of prompts to feed into the model.

Lauzon says this move by the company shows the precarity of such content moderation jobs. He alleges that GlobalLogic started regularly laying off its workers this year. “How are we supposed to feel secure in this employment when we know that we could go at any moment?” he added.

Workers still at the company claim they are increasingly concerned that they are being set up to replace themselves. According to internal documents viewed by WIRED, GlobalLogic seems to be using these human raters to train the Google AI system that could automatically rate the responses, with the aim of replacing them with AI.

At the same time, the company is also finding ways to get rid of current employees as it continues to hire new workers. In July, GlobalLogic made it mandatory for its workers in Austin, Texas, to return to office, according to a notice seen by WIRED. This has directly impacted several workers who either cannot afford to travel to the office due to financial constraints or cannot go to work due to disabilities or caregiving responsibilities.

Despite handling work they describe as skilled and high-stakes, eight workers who spoke to WIRED say they are being underpaid and suffer from lack of job security and unfavorable working conditions. These alleged conditions have impacted worker morale and challenged the ability for people to execute their jobs well, sources say. Some contractors attempted to unionize earlier this year but claim those efforts were quashed. Now they allege that the company has retaliated against them. Two workers have filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, alleging they were unfairly fired, one due to bringing up wage transparency issues, and the other for advocating for himself and his coworkers.

“These individuals are employees of GlobalLogic or their subcontractors, not Alphabet,"" Courtenay Mencini, a Google spokesperson, said in a statement. ""As the employers, GlobalLogic and their subcontractors are responsible for the employment and working conditions of their employees. We take our supplier relations seriously and audit the companies we work with against our Supplier Code of Conduct.” GlobalLogic declined to comment.

For a decade, software company GlobalLogic had a team of “generalist raters” who would help rate Google's search results. In the spring of 2023, Google asked GlobalLogic to assemble a team of “super raters” to evaluate its AI products, starting with AI Overviews.

Ricardo Levario, a teacher from Texas, was hired among the first batch of super raters. Back then he worked on Google's “search generative experience,” where the search results would display an AI generated summary—now renamed AI Overviews. His job was to determine how well the model performed and rewrite its responses to make sure it was grounded and made better use of sources.

“After the success [of this pilot], we learned that Google was interested in growing the program, and they were going to bring on cohorts of 20 people every week,” says Levario, adding that the company eventually ended up hiring as many as 2,000 super raters to work on Google's AI. But problems began when GlobalLogic started using third-party contractors to ramp up hiring, Levario claims—because while GlobalLogic super raters' pay ranged from $28 to $32 an hour, the super raters brought in via third-party contractors were paid $18 to $22 an hour for the same work. The company also has a few hundred “generalist raters” for its AI products who don't necessarily have a higher degree like the super raters. One such generalist rater, Alex, who was hired in 2023 to rate the bot's output based on the guidelines provided—which included “fluffier” questions like asking about the closest restaurant but also “not as savory” ones. She says that she hasn't received a “notable pay increase” despite being pulled into “more demanding” projects. (Alex requested that WIRED identify her by first name only due to privacy concerns).

“We as raters play an incredibly vital role, because the engineers between messing with the code and everything, they're not going to have the time to fine tune and get the feedback they need for the bot,” says Alex. “We're like the lifeguards on the beach—we're there to make sure nothing bad happens.” Alex was eventually able to secure a full time position with GlobalLogic, but she alleges that roughly 80 percent of her project folks continue to be on contract, without any benefits or paid time off.

At the end of 2023, workers created a WhatsApp group named Super Secret Secondary Location with around 80 members where some of them started discussing ways to organize. In the spring of 2024, some of these workers got together with the Alphabet Workers Union to discuss ways to create a GlobalLogic chapter for the AI raters to be able to demand better pay and working conditions. “We started building the movement underground,” says Levario. “We were essentially laying down the foundation for our union, developing our systems.” By December 2024, their chapter had 18 members.

Around that time, workplace frustrations were only growing. Alex, along with several other workers, was pulled into a project a few months prior which she initially thought would lead to promotions. But, instead it led to intensified workplace stress. Alex says that in this project, their task timers were set at five minutes, raising concerns amongst her and her coworkers that they are “sacrificing quality at this point.” “I don't even keep count of how many I do in a day,” says Alex. “I just focus more on the timer than anything else—it's gone from mentally stimulating work to mind-numbing.” She added that she often does not reach that metric of completing each task within five minutes and that the company has been “threatening many of us with losing our job or the project in general if we don't get these numbers down.”

In January when a worker quit and left messages on their social channels and via email asking the workers to organize, things started to spiral. It “opened the floodgates,” and workers started having conversations about working conditions and wage parity on these social channels. “GlobalLogic's reaction was to suppress the conversation, so they began deleting threads,” claims Levario. “One team lead even told us that we were violating company policies, which wasn't true—there was no company policy around that.” Later that month, to channel this worker agitation into action, Levario—who was one of the more vocal organizers—shared a pay and condition survey in the social channels. This worked, and the union membership grew from 18 to 60 by February.

After this incident, however, things unraveled quickly. In the first week of February, many workers received an email saying that the company's social channels—which was a way for all the remote workers to connect and forge friendships—were banned from use during work hours. These were Google's chat spaces for all sorts of groups and interests—ranging from queer and gay people to video gamers and writers. “The social spaces helped us to feel less robotic and more human,” says Faith Frontera, about the company eliminating the use of social channels. “It's important especially in a remote environment where you don't get to see your coworkers face-to-face.” Frontera joined GlobalLogic as a generalist rater to annotate, proofread, and write responses for Gemini and Magi, which is Google's new project to integrate AI in search.

Many workers believe that the banning of social spaces was a direct result of workers discussing the pay parity. “I believe that [because] the union was happening, people were discussing their pay and stuff, painting a bad picture” of GlobalLogic, claims a super rater who joined the company two years ago, requesting anonymity to speak freely. “And so they did it as a means to stop us from communicating with one another and that's what made the environment hostile.”

Even as the company restricted the use of the social spaces, Levario continued to engage on the social channels, following which he was called into a meeting to warn him from using these spaces. Levario then filed a whistleblower complaint with Hitachi. Four days later, Levario received a response to his complaint and a calendar invite. During the five minute call, Levario was fired. They told him they were terminating his contract “for violating the social spaces policy.”

Labor researchers allege this is how it typically plays out around the world with contracting agencies and workers. “This is the playbook,” says Mila Miceli, a research lead at DAIR Institute, an organization that works with AI data workers around the globe. “We have seen this in other places, almost every outsourcing company doing data work where workers have tried to collectivize and organize—this has been difficult. They have suffered retaliation.”

Globally, other AI contract workers are fighting back and organizing for better treatment and pay. Earlier this year, a group of Kenyan AI data labelers formed the Data Labelers Association in a bid to fight for better pay and working conditions and mental health support. At the same time, content moderators from around the world, who have faced and continue to deal with similar issues, formed the global trade union alliance in April. The Global Trade Union Alliance of Content Moderators includes workers from Kenya, Turkey, and Colombia.

Those that remain working at GlobalLogic say they are afraid to speak up because they may lose their jobs. “It's just been kind of [an] oppressive atmosphere,” says Alex. “We can't really organize—we're afraid that if we talk we're going to get fired or laid off.”

Nostalgic for beloved gadgets from your childhood? One easy and uncommon way to celebrate these gizmos is to frame them up on your wall. Grid Studios has been deconstructing old-school gadgets for 5 years now, and to celebrate its anniversary, the company is offering a 20 percent off sitewide discount with code GRID5, though the sale event ends September 17.

Grid Studio

Grid Studios

I've linked to the Nintendo Game Boy Advance version, the 2001 handheld that was my first portable gaming console. But Grid has all sorts of products you can choose from, including the first-ever iPhone 2G, the Google Pixel, the Samsung Galaxy S, and even the first Android phone. It extends past phones, too, with the iPod, MacBook, Apple chips, and other game consoles.

Grid says the products deconstructed in the art frame are original parts, and some of them may even show some wear and tear; however, the company uses fake batteries to prevent any hazards. Its studio is located in China, and it has warehouses in China, the US, and the Czech Republic. The frames come in two sizes, rectangular (11.7 x 16.4 inches) and square (13 x 13 inches).

The gadget is neatly laid out on the back of the frame, and there are labels pointing to and explaining what the parts are. On the Game Boy Advance, it highlights all of the buttons and internal parts, from the speaker and CPU to the L button and battery cover. At the top, you'll also find the year of the product's release (it's been 24 years since the Game Boy Advance launched!). Some of the pieces have extra text on them—the iPhones come with quotes from Steve Jobs.

These make great gifts, or a fun way to decorate a room or home office. There are preinstalled D-rings on the back of the frame, so hanging the piece up is an easy affair. You just have to peel off the plastic cover over the plexiglass. The danger is that once you buy one, you'll probably be ready to purchase another. Beats having these go to the landfill!

On Sunday, Russia released images of its launch of a 3M22 Zircon hypersonic missile from a frigate in the Barents Sea, in the Arctic Ocean, near NATO borders. The launch comes against a backdrop of rising tensions with the West, just days after several Russian drones violated the airspace of North Atlantic Treaty Organization member countries Poland and Romania.

The Zircon test is part of the Zapad 2025 joint maneuvers with Belarus, a week of military exercises aimed at assessing defensive and coordination capabilities between the two allied countries. It also serves to show that Russia's military force has not lost its strength, despite heavy losses more than three years after the start of the invasion of Ukraine.

In the video originally shared on Telegram, the crew aboard the frigate Admiral Golovko fires the Zircon at a target in the Barents Sea, an area bounded to the west by the Norwegian Sea. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the target was destroyed in a direct hit by its hypersonic missile, which can reach a distance of up to 1,000 kilometers and travel at Mach 9—nine times the speed of sound.

The images also show exercises with Sukoi Su-34 supersonic fighter-bombers, a two-seater fighter-bomber that can carry up to eight tons of armament and can fly up to 2,485 miles (4,000 kilometers) without refueling (or more than 4,350 miles, or 7,000 km, with external tanks).

There is evidence that Russia has employed hypersonic missiles against civilian targets in Ukraine, such as the Zircon or Kinzhal, which are virtually impossible to intercept. This is not only because of their speed, but also because of their maneuvering capabilities, allowing them to change course mid-flight to evade defense systems (albeit in a limited way).

This week, NATO set off international alarms due to a series of Russian drone incursions into Polish and Romanian airspace, a violation that had not been recorded so far in the Russia-Ukraine war, at least not on this scale. On September 10, at least 19 drones from Russia invaded Polish airspace, being intercepted and shot down by NATO fighters with no major damage on the ground. The incident was described by the Polish government as an ""unprecedented violation"" and a “large-scale provocation,” expressions shared by Mark Rutte, NATO's secretary general.

Poland then invoked Article 4 of the NATO Charter, which establishes a mechanism for consultation between NATO members “to exchange views and information and discuss issues before reaching agreement and taking action.” Following this debate among member countries, they launched Operation Eastern Sentinel, a military initiative to strengthen the defensive posture on the alliance's eastern flank through the deployment of advanced fighters and defense systems, among other measures, to counter missile and drone threats.

The alerts were triggered again on September 13, when Romania detected a drone, allegedly from Russia, in its airspace. Russian drone incursions into NATO airspace generated widespread international condemnation. The United States expressed support for the affected countries. “We consider this an unacceptable, regrettable and dangerous event,” said Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state. “No doubt the drones were intentionally launched. The question is whether they were intended to enter Poland.” The Russian government claimed it was not targeting Poland, while Belarus suggested the drones deviated from their initial trajectory.

Notwithstanding the attempts to offer explanations, the joint Zapad 2025 military exercises between Russia and Belarus do little to reduce tensions in Eastern Europe. Although both nations insist that the exercises are defensive in nature, the proximity of the exercises to NATO borders, as well as tests of hypersonic missiles in the Arctic, raise new concerns among Atlantic Alliance member countries.

Apple revealed Liquid Glass as part of its WWDC announcement this June, with all the pomp usually reserved for shiny new gear. The press release promised a “delightful and elegant new software design” that “reflects and refracts its surroundings while dynamically transforming to bring greater focus to content.” Today it launches globally onto compatible Apple devices.

If you haven't encountered it yet, brace yourself. Inspired by visionOS—the software powering the Apple Vision Pro mixed reality headset—Liquid Glass infuses every Apple platform with a layered glass aesthetic. This is paired with gloopy animations and a fixation on hiding interface components when possible—and showing content through them when it isn't.

The reaction during the summer's public beta program was divisive. And while some people just hate change, Liquid Glass does invite criticism. Instead of sharpening focus, it too often muddies it due to legibility issues and distracting visual effects. On Mac, controls are overly prominent, yet on iPhone, they are relentlessly eager to disappear into a new Apple take on hamburger menus, denying users the chance to build effective muscle memory.

At times, Apple even verges on parody. Its press release talked of “establishing greater harmony between hardware, software, and content,” which in practice often means further blurring the line between interface and content and slapping huge rounded corners that echo the iPad's screen onto every Mac and iPad window. The result: chopped-off content and a baffling disregard for more conventional rectangles, the most efficient shape in the history of multi-window computing.

Apple's own press images champion a desktop devoid of color, making it tricky to distinguish between a row of “etched glass” icons.

Jonas Downey, designer of Hello Weather, doesn't entirely buy Apple's pitch: “I dig Apple and weird flashy stuff and am impressed with a lot of execution details in the glass concept. But the new interfaces feel complicated and overbearing, with Apple imposing its own aesthetic ideas on everyone else. I could get on board if there was an obvious benefit,” he adds, “but I haven't seen one beyond the old adage that user interfaces should get out of the way of content. That's a fine principle, but Liquid Glass too often does the opposite.”

He reels off a list of issues. Translucent components causing distraction. Low contrast making it harder to differentiate elements. Excess shading and dimension on buttons and tabs making them pop more than the content beneath them. This, he says, can result in friction rather than focus. “Liquid Glass splits the difference between flat and skeuomorphic design, landing in a fragile middle space,” he concludes. “By trying to become more floaty and deconstructed, the system ends up more visually complex.”

For Ben McCarthy, creator of Obscura Camera, there's at least promise in the “Liquid” part of the equation: “Dynamic Island was praised for its fluidity—how it expanded and contracted like viscous ink. Liquid Glass seems born of similar thinking, in that animations should be fun, dynamic, and rooted in material behaviors—and that aspect is hugely successful.”

The “Glass” part, though? Not so much. “Apple's goal is to blend interface and content to reduce distraction, but I think Liquid Glass achieves the opposite,” McCarthy says. “It creates distortions that catch your eye as content scrolls. There are fundamental legibility issues, because Liquid Glass can't control what passes behind it. And as the system tries to adapt, flipping between light and dark to stay readable, that only further adds to the distraction.”

The iPad menu's glassy blurred backgrounds often make text hard to read.

Not everyone is down on Liquid Glass, though, and there has been excitement about the existence of a fresh, new design. Gregory de Jonckheere, creator of Quiche Browser, echoes McCarthy in being “particularly drawn to the exquisitely organic animations that build on what Apple started with Dynamic Island.” But he adds, “Even if these don't directly improve usability, a Dieter Rams principle is that good design is aesthetic. Liquid Glass makes iOS feel more alive than ever. Apple raising the bar on visual delight pushes me to do the same in my own apps.”

He also reckons many of the loudest critics are “old-timer Apple developers from the pre-iPhone era,” rooted in nostalgia and resistant to change. He suggests Liquid Glass should be considered an opportunity: Users will see their devices refreshed, and creators infusing their output with new life may convince people to reconsider their go-to apps.

Guillaume Ardaud of Héliographe spent eight years at Apple and is less convinced. He identifies the deeper problem: Liquid Glass can't decide what it wants to be. “There are real tensions between stated goals—separating interface and content layers, and then elevating the latter—and the reality of elements partially obscuring content and creating a swirl of distracting, constantly shifting colors as you scroll,” he says.

For Ardaud, though, this aspect of Liquid Glass merely reflects a wider trend in tech. Early computing emphasized usability because hardware was limited. Now that such constraints are gone, aesthetics are free to dominate, even when they may undercut information hierarchy and discoverability. Still, he retains optimism: “Apple has a history of course correction. Many of its people care deeply about usability, consistency, and accessibility. If we don't see improvements over time, that's when we'll have to start worrying.”

To be fair, some change has already happened. Liquid Glass isn't quite the same beast it was in June. As the operating systems featuring it roll out on September 15, they'll have replaced transparent glass with surfaces that appear more frosted. Aspects of design have been honed. Text on iPhone buttons has evolved from impossible-to-read to sometimes merely being indistinct. Progress. And that's what a public beta is for: iteration in the open.

In June, Apple Music had unreadable UI (left). Things improved by late August (right), but legibility remained a concern.

Still, the degree to which we saw the sausage being made was unusual. Apple likes to present designs as if they sprang forth fully formed. Even when the company feels compelled to make rapid alerations—Safari's controversial iOS 15 redesign, for example—the fallout doesn't usually impact entire operating systems. And regardless of any improvements, this year's changes will still be seismic for everyday users who don't follow Apple's every move. “I'm curious to see the reactions of people who've never heard of Liquid Glass before updating their devices,” says Ardaud. “Some people dislike sudden change, particularly on gear they use for hours every day. Drastic redesigns can cause negative reactions, not least when they discard hard-earned lessons.”

App creators may also struggle. Instead of building new features, they're now stuck supporting Liquid Glass alongside legacy interfaces. “It's extra overhead,” says Ardaud. His fix: Use Liquid Glass sparingly, “only where it makes sense,” rather than plastering it everywhere. And he suspects companies with their own design systems may ignore it entirely.

All of which raises a larger question: Should we just move beyond wholesale redesigns that are heavily driven by aesthetic novelty? Downey believes so: “Devices like the iPhone and the Mac are no longer rapidly evolving technologies that demand constant reinvention. They've matured into essential tools that power global communication and commerce. They're infrastructure, and they need to be stable.”

So why risk it? Why throw everything into upheaval when nobody needs Liquid Glass? Because Apple needs it. Design changes aren't only about usability—they're about marketing. Shiny visuals help keynote demos pop and screenshots look fresh. A feature called Liquid Glass sounds sexier than “refinements to Safari's tab bar.” A whole new look plays better with potential customers than more of the same.

It's also strategic. Rendering Liquid Glass is computationally expensive, creating what Ardaud calls a “design moat” around Apple. The effects run smoothly on recent Apple gear but would choke lower-spec devices common in the Android world. In short, Liquid Glass is Apple's alone—and tricky to steal.

But who'd even want to? Some critics argue Android's current aesthetic looks and feels sharper than Apple's. And while Apple's previous bout of major wheel reinvention, iOS 7, had copycats, it arguably aligned with prevailing simplification trends of the time. Skeuomorphism was done. Everyone needed something new. In 2025, though, who is clamoring for interfaces that recall the shapeshifting “big bad” from Terminator 2?

Control Center now has a transparent background, showing any distracting animated content behind it.

If Apple is doing this primarily for itself, that's a real problem. Steve Jobs once said, “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” By that measure, Liquid Glass falls short. As it stands, it often objectively doesn't work, at least not well. Ideally, form should follow function. Good design should be informed by function, or it's just gloss.

For its part, Apple clearly disagrees. It's proud of Liquid Glass. And it even used the Jobs quote to headline its September 2025 event that featured new iPhones with Liquid Glass—much to the chagrin of many Apple followers.

Yet it apparently also took until a public beta for Apple to spot fundamental flaws like unreadable text in the first place. This led some to question whether anyone sufficiently senior at Apple now has the taste and authority to kill such bad design decisions? Sure, those aforementioned tweaks have since come. However, as McCarthy points out, “Apple spent the summer tweaking the behaviors of Liquid Glass, but a design that still has to lean either toward illegibility or constant flickering is fundamentally flawed.”

There may be one final angle. Alan Dye, Apple's VP of human interface design, called Liquid Glass “the foundation for new experiences in the future.” Translation: Don't judge it too harshly today—it'll make sense on hardware you can't yet buy. Foldables, maybe, or a “bezel-less” iPad. But Liquid Glass isn't launching on hypothetical gadgets. It's arriving on your iPhone, iPad, and Mac imminently. And instead of elevating content, it frequently obscures or dominates it.

Naturally, Apple won't talk about future plans. It wouldn't even comment on the record to WIRED about the present state of Liquid Glass. So we're left to guess about the why. Future hardware? Marketing? Rousing apathetic customers? Apple's design team chasing a sci-fi aesthetic that dazzles in Avengers movies but breaks down in actual use?

Layered glass works when you're supposed to focus on an actor. But in the real world, Liquid Glass too often doesn't help you focus attention on what matters most—your content. It demands attention for itself.

Tin Can has struck a chord — with parents, kids, and now venture capitalists. 

The Seattle startup behind a landline-style telephone for kids has raised $3.5 million from PSL Ventures, Newfund Capital, Mother Ventures, and Solid Foundations.

“I think you can legitimately say Tin Can is one of the fastest growing and most viral businesses I have seen in more than 25 years of venture investing,” Greg Gottesman, managing director at Seattle-based PSL, told GeekWire. 

We first spotlighted Tin Can in April, just as the company was getting off the ground. Its colorful WiFi-enabled landline phones — shaped like oversized tin cans — let kids talk to one another without screens, texting and apps.

The 7-person company quickly sold out its first two batches of products and is now taking pre-orders for shipments in December. 

“We started by building a phone just for our own kids, and it's been amazing to see that snowball into something much bigger that clearly resonates with families everywhere,” said Tin Can co-founder and CEO Chet Kittleson.

The company declined to share specific revenue or sales metrics.

Tin Can's early success comes amid mounting concern over the impact of smartphones and social media on kids' mental health, attention spans, and social development.

“Parents everywhere are grappling with how to give their kids independence without handing them the internet too soon,” Kittleson said. “That cultural shift — away from screens and toward more analogue forms of connection — has been a huge tailwind for us.”

Tin Can phones are priced at $75 and sold directly to families. Parents can choose between two calling plans — a free version that allows calling to other Tin Can devices, and a $9.99/month version that enables calls to approved outside numbers (cell phones, landlines). 

A companion mobile app lets parents manage contacts. Only approved numbers can get through, blocking robocalls or strangers. Quiet hours can disable calls and there's voicemail capability — which Tin Can calls an “answering machine.” Tin Can also supports 911 emergency calling that can be enabled in the mobile app.

Kittleson said the device helps relieve parents' anxiety about the risks that come with smartphones and apps. 

“And kids love it because it feels like their very own phone,” he said. There are also fun easter egg surprises, such as dialing “HAHA” for a daily joke or “WORD” for a daily definition.

Kittleson said even grandparents say calls with Tin Can phones are “more thoughtful, more focused” — especially compared to “dizzying FaceTime tours of the living room.”

Kittleson founded Tin Can with Graeme Davies and Max Blumen, his former colleauges at Seattle real estate startup Far Homes, which shut down last year. 

Vivek Ladsariya, managing director at PSL, praised the company's mission-driven approach.

“It shows in the product, messaging, and branding and it's why customers love them,” Ladsariya said. “They want kids to live in an analog world and as I think of my brand new daughter that's what I want for her.”

Apple's iOS 26 software update for iPhones is available Monday to people who have an iPhone 11, iPhone SE 2, and later. iOS 26's marquee feature is Apple's Liquid Glass design, which includes elements on screen that resembled a “glassy” look. Other features include a call screening assistant, a new gaming and preview app, in-app translation across the system, and updates to Genmoji and Image Playground apps.

The operating system update also went through a big numerical change as Apple jumped from iOS 18 to iOS 26 for two key reasons. First, it wanted to bring all operating systems — iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and VisionOS — in sync. And it also wanted to reflect the year number in which the majority of the people will use this update.

Liquid Glass design has been the most significant visual overhaul for iOS in years. Apple's intention with this redesign was to take inspiration from the Vision Pro interface and apply it to all of its operating systems. The elements are meant to look like they are made of translucent glass. This resulted in challenges in terms of readability and how elements in the background look.

Since June, Apple has made changes to how “glassy” the interface looks multiple times through beta releases. While the company is releasing the stable version of iOS 26 today, we might expect visual tweaks for improved readability and usability in the coming months. This visual change might take a bit of time for users to adjust, and they might not like certain elements right away.

The Phone app has a new unified look where your favorites are up top in a card format with recents and voicemails on the same screen. You can tap the filter button on the top right and look at these sections individually as well. (If you don't like the new interface, Apple also gives you an option to switch to the classic look.)

iOS 26 also brings a call screening feature to iPhones, which is a personal favorite. When an unknown number calls you, the system asks for their name and the purpose of the call. Once they give this information, the system invokes the ringer and notifies you of the call. You can look at the conversation and interject at any time. Transcription of voicemail doesn't work well for all languages, but call screening has reduced the number of calls I've had to pick up.

There's also a holding assist for when a restaurant or a helpline places you on hold; you can use call assist to notify when an agent starts talking again.

The Messages app is getting to feature party with other chat apps like WhatsApp and Telegram with backgrounds, new conversation flow, polls, text selection, photo previews, and typing indicators in groups. Apple has been working on SMS filtering for a few years now. The company said it updated its spam filtering with this release. Plus, it places messages from unknown senders in a new folder. One thing I didn't like about this update is that it takes me a couple of taps to go to the transactions tab.

The games app overhaul means that you can look at the games you are playing (or have played), arcade games, challenges, and achievements in one place, along with suggestions for new titles. The app also shows you what your friends are playing.

Apple finally added Mac's Preview app to iOS 26, which means you can edit, annotate, and sign PDFs more easily. 

Meanwhile, Apple Music now has automixing for dynamic song switching, along with lyrics translation and pronunciation. What's more, you can pin your favorite songs and playlists.

With iOS 26, Apple Maps lets you define preferred routes while commuting. In case your choice of route has more traffic or any incidents, Maps sends you a notification along with suggesting alternative routes. The app also lets you easily view visited places through a new places library. 

The Camera app in iOS 26 adopts the Liquid Glass design with only Video and Photo options visible by default. You can scroll to the left or right to switch between different modes. Apple has placed some controls like Flash and Night mode on the top right, and you can switch them on/off with one touch. For more options like filters, styles, exposure controls, and timer, you can swipe up from the bottom of the screen.

If you didn't like the previous Photos app design, the tabs are back in this version.

Unlike last year's grand launch of Apple Intelligence, this year's operating system is light on AI features, especially given delays in launching and rolling out features. The company is making AI-powered translation easily available in apps like Messages, FaceTime, and Phone. Currently, this feature supports English (UK, US), French (France), German, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish (Spain). 

Through iOS 26, the company is also launching live translation on AirPods, including the newly launched AirPods Pro 3, AirPods Pro 2, and AirPods 4. 

iOS 26 updates visual intelligence to understand the content on the screen. You have to press Power + volume down button to bring up this menu. Apple Intelligence can then suggest events to add to your calendar. You can also ask questions about the content on the screen, using Google Visual Search or ChatGPT. Apple is also releasing its own “Circle to search” called Highlight. 

The most confusing part about this update is that the buttons used to bring up on-screen visual intelligence are the same as the screenshot button. Because of this, it takes an extra step to save a screenshot, and I have forgotten to save some important screenshots. 

Apple is updating Genmoji with iOS 26 to let you merge two emojis with a text prompt and make something new. You can now add expression to people in both Genmoji and Image Playground. Update to Image Playground now allows you to modify attributes like hair and facial hair, along with new styles from ChatGPT.

We have a list of tons of small but useful iOS features here. You can update to iOS 26 by going to Settings>General>Software Update and downloading the latest version.

OpenAI announced Monday that it's releasing a new version of GPT-5 to its AI coding agent, Codex. The company says its new model, called GPT-5-Codex, spends its “thinking” time more dynamically than previous models, and could spend anywhere from a few seconds to seven hours on a coding task. As a result, it performs better on agentic coding benchmarks.

The new model is now rolling out in Codex products — which can be accessed via a terminal, IDE, GitHub, or ChatGPT — to all ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, and Enterprise users. OpenAI says it plans to make the model available to API customers in the future.

The update is part of OpenAI's effort to make Codex more competitive with other AI coding products, such as Claude Code, Anysphere's Cursor, or Microsoft's GitHub Copilot. The market for AI coding tools has become much more crowded in the last year, as a result of intense user demand. Cursor surpassed $500 million in ARR earlier in 2025 and Windsurf, a similar code editor, was the subject of a chaotic acquisition attempt that saw its team split between Google and Cognition.

OpenAI says that GPT-5-Codex outperforms GPT-5 on SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark measuring agentic coding abilities, as well as a benchmark measuring performance on code refactoring tasks from large, established repositories.

The company also says it trained GPT-5-Codex for conducting code reviews, and asked experience software engineers to evaluate the model's review comments. The engineers reportedly found GPT-5-Codex to submit fewer incorrect comments, while adding more “high-impact comments.”

In a briefing, OpenAI's Codex product lead Alexander Embiricos said that much of the increased performance was thanks to GPT-5-Codex's dynamic “thinking abilities.” Users may be familiar with GPT-5's router in ChatGPT, which directs queries to different models based on the complexity of a task. Embiricos said GPT-5-Codex works similarly, but has no router under the hood, and can adjust for how long to work on a task in real-time.

Embiricos says this is an advantage compared to a router, which decides how much computational power and time to use on a problem at the outset. Instead, GPT-5-Codex can decide five minutes into a problem that it needs to spend another hour. Embiricos said he's seen the model take upwards of seven hours in some cases.

But we found that most developers struggled to write reliable code with implicit determinism, found breaking their work into small “steps” tricky, and they wanted to install any system packages they needed. Serverless timeouts made this even more painful.We also wanted to allow you to wait for things to happen: on external events, other tasks finishing, or just time passing. Those waits can take minutes, hours, or forever in the case of events, so you can't just keep a server running.The solution was to build and operate our own serverless cloud infrastructure. The key breakthrough that enabled this was realizing we could snapshot the CPU and memory state. This allowed us to pause running code, store the snapshot, then restore it later on a different physical server. We currently use Checkpoint Restore In Userspace (CRIU) which Google has been using at scale inside Borg since 2018.Since then, our adoption has really taken off especially because of AI agents/workflows. This has opened up a ton of new use cases like compute-heavy tasks such as generating videos using AI (Icon.com), real-time computer use (Scrapybara), AI enrichment pipelines (Pallet, Centralize), and vibe coding tools (Hero UI, Magic Patterns, Capy.ai).You can get started with Trigger.dev cloud (https://cloud.trigger.dev), self-hosting (https://trigger.dev/docs/self-hosting/overview), or read the docs (https://trigger.dev/docs).Here's a sneak peek at some upcoming changes: 1) warm starts for self-hosting 2) switching to MicroVMs for execution – this will be open source, self-hostable, and will include checkpoint/restoring.We're excited to be sharing this with HN and are open to all feedback!

However I do personally really dislike that everyone is either marketing themselves or has truly pivoted to AI agents…This seems like a great platform to run any type of tasks.

I'm the CEO of a direct competitor to trigger, and we're in the same boat.  What we make is great for any type of workflow, but our investors are pushing us hard to frame it as AI agents.FWIW, more than 1/2 of our customers are AI agents, so it does make sense.  But you're right, it's great for all sorts of use cases (trigger and us).

We use it as an extension of our node app, for all things asynchronous (long or short). The fact that it's the same codebase on our server and trigger cloud is a huge plus.For me, it's the most accessible incarnation of serverless. You can add it to your stack for one task and gradually use it for more and more tasks (long or short). Testing and local development is easy as can be. The tooling is just right. No complex configurations. You can incrementally use the queuing, wait points, batch triggers for more power.We've had some issues with migrating from v3 to v4. The transition felt rushed (some of the docs / examples are still showing v3 code, that is deprecated in v4). I understand that it might take some time to update the docs and examples, because there is a lot of content.

Question: is a first-class Supabase/Postgres integration on the roadmap so we can (a) start Trigger jobs from SQL functions and (b) read job status via a foreign data wrapper? That ""SQL-native job control (invoke from SQL, query from SQL)"" path would make Trigger.dev feel native in Supabase apps.Disclosure: I'm building pgflow, a Postgres-first workflow/background jobs layer for Supabase (https://pgflow.dev).

Listing hero allows ecom brands to generate consistent templated infographics so I reinvented all these things via data share between Django, Celery processes, Prefect, and webhooks. Users can start multiple generations at the same time and all run in parallel in Prefect and realtime progress  visible in frontend via webhooks.I will try playing with Trigger next weekend and probably integrate with a static stack like cloudflare worker. Excited to try it out!

One thing I did notice though from looking through the examples is this:Uncaught errors automatically cause retries of tasks using your settings. Plus there are helpers for granular retrying inside your tasks.This feels like one of those gotchas that is absolutely prone to benign refactoring causing huge screwups, or at least someone will find they pinged a pay for service 50x by accident without realising.ergonomics like your helper of await retry.onThrow feel like a developer friendly default ""safe"" approach rather than just an optional helper, though granted it's not as magic feeling when you're trying convert eyeballs into users.

When you setup your project you choose the default number of retries and back-off settings. Generally people don't go as high as 50 and setup alerts when runs fail. Then you can use the bulk replaying feature when things do wrong, or if services you rely on have long outages.I think on balance it is the correct behaviour.

Both of them are focused more on being workflow engines.Temporal is a workflow engine – if you use their cloud product you still have to manage, scale, and deploy the compute.With Temporal you need to write your code in a very specific way for it work, including working with the current time, randomness, process.env, setTimeout… This means you have to be careful using popular packages because they often using these common functions internally. Or you need to wrap all of these calls in side effects or activities.Restate is definitely simpler than Temporal, in a good way. You wrap any code that's non-deterministic in their helpers so it won't get executed twice. I don't think you can install system packages that you need, which has been surprisingly important for a lot of our users.

Trigger.dev is a queue and workflow engine but we also run compute. This makes some things possible which aren't when you only control one side:1. No timeouts, you can run code for as long as you need.
2. You don't need to divide your work into steps. If you want you can use multiple tasks.
3. You can install any system packages you need, like ffmpeg, Puppeteer etc. Depending on where you're deploying this can be a problem with other tools. There are maximum bundle sizes on a lot of platforms which are surprisingly easy to hit.
4. Atomic versioning. Each deploy of your tasks is separate and any runs that have started will continue until finished, locked to that version of the code. This means you don't need to think about versioning inside your code which can becomes messy and error prone.One other note is that we're Apache 2.0.

- We're not really an agent framework, but more like a agent runtime that is agnostic to what framework you choose to run on our infra. We have lots of people running langchain, mastra, AI SDK, hand-rolled, etc on top of us, since we are just a compute platform. We have the building blocks needed for running any kind of agent or AI workflow: ability to run system packages (anything from chrome to ffmpeg), long-running (e.g. no timeouts), realtime updates to your frontend (including streaming tokens). We also provide queues and concurrency limits for doing stuff like multitenant concurrency, observability built on OpenTelemetry, schedules for doing ETL/ELT data stuff (including multitenant schedules).
- We are TS first and believe the future of agents and AI Applications will be won by TS devs.
- We have a deep integration with snapshotting so code can be written in a natural way but still exhibit continuation style behavior. For example, you can trigger another agent or task or tool to run (lets say an agent that specializes in browser use) and wait for the result as a tool call result. Instead of having to introduce a serialization boundary so you can stop compute while waiting and then rhydrate and resume through skipped ""steps"" or activities we instead will snapshot the process, kill it, and resume it later, continuing from the exact same process state as before.  This is all handled under the hood and managed by us. We're currently using CRIU for this but will be moving to whole VM snapshots with our MicroVM release.

We don't use Trigger for marketing at all and I actually never thought of it for that use case.We're an AI design tool - prompt to create an interactive mockup - and we use Trigger to take screenshots of designs to provide a preview image. Taking a screenshot sounds easy, but it's not because Puppeteer constantly hits OOM errors.  So you need a high-end machine, and so it can get expensive. We originally were using a homegrown solution, a microservice, but it would constantly crash (even though were paying $$$$$ for it).Trigger spinning up jobs was perfect and we migrated in a day and now I never think about it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Trump Admin Says ‘Framework' Reached for U.S. Owners to Take Control of TikTok","https://gizmodo.com/trump-admin-says-framework-reached-for-u-s-owners-to-take-control-of-tiktok-2000658887","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 16:21:23 GMT","

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday that the U.S. has “a framework for a TikTok deal,” suggesting that some kind of agreement is imminent to allow the social media platform to continue operating in the U.S. despite a law passed in 2024 that sought to ban the app or force a sale.

The comments from Bessent came as he and U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer took questions from reporters after two days of meetings with Chinese officials in Madrid. 

“We believe we have an agreement. It's just subject to the leader's approval,” Greer said about the TikTok negotiations specifically.

Greer was asked about whether there would be any further extensions beyond Wednesday's deadline, and he said that if there were, it would be “some period of time just to get it signed,” but “we're not going to be in the business of having repetitive extensions.”

There have been repeated extensions, though, despite President Donald Trump's insistence that there wouldn't be. Congress passed a law in 2024, signed by President Joe Biden, that said Bytedance is required to sell TikTok to American interests or be banned entirely in the U.S. The first deadline was Jan. 19, but that was extended until April. And then Trump signed an executive order extending it again until June. That was then extended yet again until Sept. 17, which is this Wednesday.

When Bessent was asked by reporters about timing, he deflected but confirmed that the framework involves control by U.S. interests.

“The framework is for it to switch to a U.S.-controlled ownership,” said Bessent. “But again, I'm not going to get ahead of the leaders' call on Friday. We have a framework. They'll have to confirm the deal.”

It's not clear if “U.S.-controlled ownership” would involve some form of U.S. government ownership or just private American ownership. The U.S. recently took a 10% stake in Intel in a highly controversial move.

U.S. negotiators in Spain talked about a range of trade issues, including tariffs and rare earth minerals, in talks Sunday and Monday. The U.S. has placed high tariffs on China (30% on most imported goods), but even higher tariffs (145%) have been paused until November.

President Trump suggested there was a deal even before Bessent talked with reporters Monday, describing a “certain” company in terms that looked like an attempt to be vague while also being incredibly obvious. In one of several posts to Truth Social on Monday morning, Trump did his best wink-wink about TikTok.

“The big Trade Meeting in Europe between The United States of America, and China, has gone VERY WELL! It will be concluding shortly,” Trump wrote.

“A deal was also reached on a ‘certain' company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save. They will be very happy! I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday. The relationship remains a very strong one!!!” Trump continued.

Trump was actually the one to first sign an executive order trying to ban TikTok during his first term. But the president pulled a complete one-eighty in March 2024, about eight months before the election. It's unclear why Trump changed his mind so drastically, but pundits noticed at the time that he had recently spoken with Republican mega-donor Jeff Yass, a billionaire with a big investment in ByteDance.

Bytedance has repeatedly said it's not interested in selling TikTok, and it's not clear what exactly is being worked out behind closed doors. Several potential U.S. buyers have come forward, but one of the biggest sticking points is TikTok's algorithm, which is considered its secret sauce and the reason people become addicted to it.

Without the algorithm, you've just got a recognizable name. But if Chinese officials still don't want the U.S. to have control of the algorithm, it's unclear where that would leave a potential deal.

The Texas Chainsaw Massacre could head to TV with an assist from Glen Powell. Filming has wrapped on Practical Magic 2. Plus, could even more be on the way from Matt Reeves' Batman universe? To me, my spoilers!



In response to a fan on Threads (via Comic Book), James Gunn stated the decision to decorate the set of Clayface with stickers, graffiti, and fliers referencing Robert Pattinson's Batman movie “never came across [his] desk” and was likely done over his head.

Although the trash can is from the set I have a hard time believing the bat was put there by the art department. But if so it never came across my desk (I don't have time to ok every piece of set dressing.)

Despite last night's Emmy win for The Penguin, Matt Reeves confirmed to MTV that Cristin Milioti will not return as Sofia Falcone in The Batman, Part II.

Cristin is not in this one [The Batman, Part II]. But that's because we were so deep into the script by the time we were in the show. But we'll see. I mean, I think she's incredible. What she did in the show is just astonishing. And what [The Penguin showrunner] Lauren [LeFranc] did in creating that character. I mean, creating this version of the character. It's so special, so it'd be really exciting to do something with her. But she's not in this one, in full disclosure, because we were so far along in the story.

During a recent interview with Republik, Don't Look Up director Adam McKay revealed he's struggling to find producers willing to make his climate change disaster movie, Greenhouse, starring Amy Adams and Sam Rockwell.

It's probably the biggest film I've written so far, simply because of its scale and the many tones it combines. It ranges from drama to action. There are humorous elements, but also elements of great tragedy. And indeed, this film also contains hopeful scenarios that show what concrete action against global warming can look like. And how beautiful and transformative that can be. The film encompasses many scenarios, characters, and places around the world. The only catch is: I'll see if I can even make the film.

Bloody-Disgusting reports Johannes Roberts (47 Meters Down, The Strangers: Prey at Night, Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City) is attached to direct Primate, a “primal tale of horror and survival” that sounds like a cross between Link and 12 Feet Deep. The story concerns recent college grad, Lucy, as she “reunites with [her] family, including pet chimp, Ben. Ben contracts rabies during a pool party and turns aggressive. Lucy and friends then barricade [themselves] in [the] pool, devising ways to survive the vicious chimp.”

Filming has wrapped on Practical Magic 2, according to Nicole Kidman on Instagram.

A carnival barker plans to exhibit a castle of monsters in the trailer for Stitch Head.

Should the company win the bidding rights, Deadline suggests J.T. Mollner, Roy Lee, and actor Glen Powell have plans to produce a TV series based on The Texas Chainsaw Massacre at A24. Though “the deal hasn't closed yet, A24 has pole position” on the auction as its current highest bidder.

Matt Reeves confirmed to IndieWire he's “talked” to DC about further Batman-related spinoff series' following The Batman, Part II.

I totally do, we've talked about it. That's where the priorities have been [The Batman Part II]. These conversations may or may not… Look, I'm not in control of DC, and I can only tell you what I'd love to do, and there are things they know we would love to do, and those conversations may begin again when it's appropriate.

Finally, the first nine minutes of the new Netflix animated series, Haunted Hotel, are now available to watch on YouTube.

The generative AI industry has promised to “disrupt” society, and on that front, it can be said to have succeeded. AI has certainly disrupted many parts of society, including education, social media, and politics. Most of all, it seems to have disrupted the tech industry itself, where what was once a profitable career (software development) increasingly seems to be more of a precarious one, thanks to the rise of so-called “vibe coding”—a form of AI-assisted software development that requires less experience and more automation.

This whole vibe coding thing doesn't seem to be working out for companies, however, as generating code via an LLM prompt at breakneck speed can, predictably, lead to less-than-stellar work. Now, in an ironic twist, it seems that, having dispensed with more skilled coders for the cheap effectiveness of a chatbot-aided code monkey, companies are having to hire additional contractors to fix the AI's screw-ups.

404 Media writes about the rise of an entire new class of coders, dubbed the “vibe coding cleanup specialists,” who can swoop in to fix the problems that AI-generated code creates for companies. The outlet cites one description shared with them by a specialist, who said his particular expertise was to “polish” up codebases that might be a little rough around the edges:

“I've been offering vibe coding fixer services for about two years now, starting in late 2023. Currently, I work with around 15-20 clients regularly, with additional one-off projects throughout the year,” Hamid Siddiqi, who offers to “review, fix your vibe code” on Fiverr, told me in an email. “I started fixing vibe-coded projects because I noticed a growing number of developers and small teams struggling to refine AI-generated code that was functional but lacked the polish or ‘vibe' needed to align with their vision. I saw an opportunity to bridge that gap, combining my coding expertise with an eye for aesthetic and user experience.”

Siddiqi told 404 that he commonly assists companies with “inconsistent UI/UX design in AI-generated frontends, poorly optimized code that impacts performance, misaligned branding elements, and features that function but feel clunky or unintuitive.” Yet another cleanup specialist, Swatantra Sohni, told the outlet that they think AI is being leveraged by people who don't otherwise have the digital skills to build products. The results are predictable:

“Most of these vibe coders, either they are product managers or they are sales guys, or they are small business owners, and they think that they can build something,” Sohni told me. “So for them it's more for prototyping. Vibe coding is, at the moment, kind of like infancy. It's very handy to convey the prototype they want, but I don't think they are really intended to make it like a production grade app.”

It's unclear how widely these services are being offered, but given the rising popularity of vibe-coding amongst small businesses, it seems likely that it would be a growing market. As with many other AI-led industries, humans are still necessary after all.

The companies frantically building and leasing data centers are well aware that they're straining grids, driving emissions, and guzzling water. The electricity demand of AI data centers in particular could increase as much as 165% by 2030. Over half of the energy powering these sprawling facilities comes from fossil fuels, threatening to reverse progress toward addressing the climate crisis.

Some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence say they have a solution: Just stick these colossal computer clusters in space. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told manosphere podcaster Theo Vonn that he considers a massive expansion of data centers inevitable. “I do guess a lot of the world gets covered in data centers over time,” he said. (This is not, in fact, inevitable, but the result of unfathomably wealthy companies choosing to invest unfathomably large sums of money. Altman has speculated that he would quite literally put trillions into it, and OpenAI is part of the consortium behind the $500 billion Stargate project.)

Altman is aware, however, that some people might not like this. “I've spoken with environmentalists,” he said. Then, he offered a suggestion. “Maybe we put [data centers] in space,” he said. “I wish I had, like, more concrete answers for you, but like, we're stumbling through this.”

Now, the idea of hurling data centers, the largest of which can cover over a million square feet, into orbit may seem impractical. But Altman's not alone in considering it. Jeff Bezos and Eric Schmidt are also betting on the idea.

Altman has proposed creating a Dyson sphere of data centers around the sun, referring to a hypothetical megastructure built around a star to capture much of its energy. The rather glaring downside to this is that building it would likely require more resources than exist on Earth, and could make the planet uninhabitable. But somewhat more realistic plans are inching closer to reality. Startups like Starcloud, Axiom, and Lonestar Data Systems have raised millions to develop them.

There are at least 5,400 data centers in the United States, ranging from micro-size to thousand-server “hyperscalers,” and the number is growing fast. These facilities are expected to consume up to 12% of the nation's electricity by 2028. Putting them in space, then, can seem like a panacea: solving the energy-use problem with 24/7 solar power, and freeing communities from the burden of air, noise, and water pollution.

There's some real science behind this. Ali Hajimiri, an electrical engineer and professor with Caltech's Space Solar Power Project, sought a patent for a “massively parallel computational system in space”—as in, a data center—back in 2016. Since then, launch costs have gone down (to around $1,500 per kilogram, by one estimate), and solar panels have gotten lighter and more efficient. Hajimiri and his colleagues recently proposed a lightweight space-based solar power system that could generate electricity at 10 cents per kilowatt-hour, significantly cheaper at scale than comparable systems here on Earth.

Such technology theoretically could power orbital data centers like those Altman imagines, though Hajimiri is still not sure when they could be built at the kind of scale companies like OpenAI demand. “I never want to say something cannot be done,” he said. “But there are challenges associated with it.”

For one thing, the systems he imagines process data relatively slowly compared to those on terra firma. They'd be constantly bombarded by radiation, and “obsolescence would be a problem” because making repairs or upgrades would be confoundingly difficult. Hajimiri believes that data centers in space could, someday, be a viable solution, but he hesitates to say when that day might come. “Definitely it would be doable in a few years,” he said. “The question is how effective they would be and how cost-effective they would become.”

The idea of simply putting data centers in orbit is not limited to the offhand musings of techies or the deeper thoughts of academics. Even some elected officials in cities where companies like Amazon hope to build data centers are raising the point. Tucson, Arizona, councilmember Nikki Lee waxed poetic about their potential during an August hearing, in which the council unanimously voted down a proposed data center in their city.

“A lot of people are saying data centers don't belong in the desert,” Lee said. But “if this is truly a national priority,” then the focus must be on “putting federal research and development dollars into looking at data centers that will exist in space. And that may sound wild to you all and a little science fiction, but it's actually happening.”

That's true, but it's happening on an experimental scale, not an industrial one. A startup called Starcloud hoped to launch a refrigerator-sized satellite housing a few Nvidia chips in August, but the launch date was pushed back. Lonestar Data Systems landed a miniature data center, carrying precious information like an Imagine Dragons song, on the moon a few months ago, though the lander tipped over and died in the attempt. More such launches are planned for the coming months. But it's “very hard to predict how quickly this idea will become economically feasible,” said Matthew Weinzierl, a Harvard University economist who studies market forces in space. “Space-based data centers may well have some niche uses, such as for processing space-based data and providing national security capabilities,” he said. “To be a meaningful rival to terrestrial centers, however, they will need to compete on cost and service quality like anything else.”

For now, it's much more expensive to put a data center in space than it is to put one in, say, Virginia's Data Center Valley, where power demand could double in the next decade if left unregulated. And as long as staying on Earth remains cheaper, profit-motivated companies will favor terrestrial data center expansion.

Still, there is one factor that might encourage OpenAI and others to look toward the heavens: there isn't much regulation up there. Building data centers on Earth requires obtaining municipal permits, and companies can be stymied by local governments whose residents worry that data center development might siphon their water, raise their electricity bills, or overheat their planet. In space, there aren't any neighbors to complain, said Michelle Hanlon, a political scientist and lawyer who leads the Center for Air and Space Law at the University of Mississippi. “If you are a U.S. company seeking to put data centers in space, then the sooner the better, before Congress is like, ‘Oh, we need to regulate that.'”

Video game publisher 2K Games has released an extensive list of recommended graphics settings for Borderlands 4 across Nvidia and AMD GPUs at 1080p, 1440p, and 4K. These presets are said to offer players a reliable baseline, something that many found missing right after the game's launch last week.

The official requirements for Borderlands 4 highlight just how demanding the game is across GPU generations, and the results aren't flattering by any means. If we look at Nvidia, the minimum requirements list the RTX 2070, which can barely scrape by at 1080p, managing just 30 FPS with DLSS upscaling, along with low settings for textures, shadows, and foliage. A smoother 60 FPS gaming experience at 1080p requires an RTX 3060 Ti. If you want to play the game smoothly at 1440p with 60 FPS, the RTX 3080 12GB is the minimum requirement, but not without DLSS and demanding texture features set to medium.

More settings have been listed by 2K Games for Nvidia GPUs and AMD GPUs.

On paper, the RTX 5090 stands out as the most powerful gaming graphics card available, and Borderlands 4 puts that muscle to good use. According to 2K's recommendations, it's the only GPU positioned to run Borderlands 4 at 4K (with DLSS and frame generation enabled) while pushing nearly every visual setting to the max. Notably, these recommendations only target a minimum of 60 FPS, which feels less than impressive for a flagship-grade GPU that costs upwards of $3,000.

On the other hand, the Radeon RX 5700 XT from AMD serves as an entry point for 1080p, although this can only be achieved using FSR and reduced settings for shadows and lighting to maintain frame rates at 60 FPS and above. As for mid-range GPUs like the RX 6700 XT and RX 7700 XT, they should be good enough at 1440p while maintaining much of the game's visual quality. At the higher end, the RX 6950 XT and RX 7900 XTX push into 4K territory, but still rely on FSR in Balanced or Performance mode to deliver consistent performance.

AMD's latest Radeon 9000 series is also part of the recommended list, with the latest RDNA 4 GPUs offering the best experience for Borderlands 4. The lineup benefits from FSR 4 and improved frame generation support, thus making the Radeon RX 9060 and 9060 XT suitable for 1440p, while the RX 9070 and 9070 XT are recommended to run the game at 4K / 60.

The release of these preset settings comes in the wake of Borderlands 4 drawing criticism for severe performance issues. Players have reportedly been running into all sorts of issues, ranging from low frame rates, stuttering, and crashes, even on top-tier graphics cards like the RTX 5090. While a 2.7GB day-one patch improved stability and fixed some crashes and errors, reports of inconsistent performance continue to surface. Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford acknowledged the situation, noting that players with systems below spec or without SSDs would likely struggle.

The recommended settings also highlight just how demanding the game truly is. Even with Nvidia's latest RTX 50-series and AMD's Radeon 9000-series GPUs, players are expected to lean on upscaling and frame generation to achieve smooth performance at higher resolutions. That in itself speaks volumes about the game's hardware demands, underlying optimization issues, or likely both.

Bernard-Alex Gauzere, MD

 September 15, 2025  

A recent US study published in JAMA Surgery analyzed national mortality data and found that surgeons had significantly higher mortality risk than other doctors, highlighting the occupational toll of surgical practice.

The analysis found that death rates of surgeons were 56% higher than those of nonsurgeon physicians, raising urgent questions about the workplace conditions, stressors, and lifestyle burdens unique to the profession.

Although decades of research have examined mortality among physicians and healthcare professionals, data specific to surgeons are scarce.

Long hours, high-stress environments, workplace violence, and occupational exposure to ionizing radiation place surgeons at particular risk.

Researchers examined US death certificate records from the 2023 National Vital Statistics System for adults aged 25-74.

The records included demographics, cause of death, and usual occupation as reported by the informant.

Mortality rates were calculated using population denominators from the 2023 American Community Survey, stratified by age, sex, and profession.

The figures for surgeons and physicians were cross-referenced with the AMA Physician Masterfile, a population-based registry of physicians.

Nonsurgeon physicians served as the primary comparison group, while lawyers, engineers, and scientists were included because of similar education and income profiles. All other professionals were grouped separately for the analysis.

Mortality rates were age- and sex-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population using direct standardization. Mortality rate ratios (MRRs) were used to quantify relative risks across professional groups.

The study included 1,080,298 deaths, comprising 224 surgeons (0.02%) and 2740 other physicians (0.25%).

The age- and sex-adjusted mortality rate per 100,000 was higher for surgeons (355.3; 95% CI, 274.5-458.8) than for nonsurgeon physicians (228.4; 95% CI, 218.7-238.4), yielding an MRR of 1.56 (95% CI, 1.36-1.78).

The adjusted mortality rate of surgeons was similar to that of lawyers, engineers, and scientists (404.5; 95% CI, 397.5-411.6; MRR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77-1.00) but lower than that of the broader workforce (632.5; 95% CI, 631.3-633.7; MRR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.49-0.64).

Cancer and cardiovascular disease remained the leading causes of death across all occupations; however, distinct patterns emerged among surgeons.

Road traffic accidents ranked as the fourth most common cause of death among surgeons compared with ninth rank in other professions.

Surgeons were also more likely to die from hypertension-related diseases and assaults. Cancer mortality was notably higher among surgeons (193.2; 95% CI, 128.2-284.0) than among nonsurgeons (87.5; 95% CI, 81.4-94.0), with an MRR of 2.21 (95% CI, 1.75-2.80).

Nonsurgeon physicians showed reduced mortality relative to other high-income professionals, but this pattern was not observed among surgeons.

The elevated risk may reflect differences in workplace demands, schedules, and exposures. The results indicate that several causes of death, such as road traffic accidents, affect surgeons more, which is consistent with data showing that road traffic accidents related to long working hours are more frequent among surgeons.

A limitation of this study is that only 2023 data were available, which prevented the analysis of annual mortality trends. The small number of surgeon deaths reflects the workforce size as all eligible deaths were included.

Pauline  Anderson

 September 15, 2025  

Liafensine, a first-in-class triple-reuptake inhibitor targeting serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters, was effective and well tolerated in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) who are carriers of the ankyrin-3 (ANK3) gene, results of a phase 2b randomized trial showed.

Treatment with liafensine was associated with significantly greater decreases in symptoms of major depressive disorder than placebo, with improvements reported just 1 week after therapy initiation.

“This represents a first successful genetic biomarker-guided clinical trial in psychiatry, advancing a new treatment for TRD and providing a new path for developing precision medicines in the field,” the investigators wrote.

The findings were published online on September 10 in JAMA Psychiatry.

The ANK3 gene plays an important role in neuronal signaling through modulation of cell membrane proteins and is primarily expressed in the nervous system. Research links this gene to psychiatric disorders, including depression.

Unlike most commonly used antidepressants that inhibit reuptake of serotonin or serotonin and norepinephrine, liafensine inhibits the transporters for all three key monoamines, including dopamine transporters.

Despite expectations, the drug failed to demonstrate efficacy in two prior large-scale phase 2b trials in nonbiomarker-selected patients with TRD.

However, a genome-wide scan using DNA from patients in the earlier trials determined that there was a strong correlation between single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12217173 status and efficacy in patients treated with liafensine. This SNP resides in the ANK3 gene and showed the strongest association with drug efficacy, the investigators wrote.

In the 20% of study participants in the original trials who were ANK3 biomarker positive, liafensine demonstrated significant efficacy compared with the control antidepressants duloxetine or escitalopram.

To prospectively confirm liafensine's efficacy in ANK3-positive patients, the investigators launched a new trial at 59 sites in the US, Canada, and China. The ENLIGHTEN study was blinded and included 189 adults with TRD (mean age, 43 years; 63% women; 48% White). 

Although most participants were ANK3-positive, the study included a few ANK3-negative patients who were enrolled for exploratory observation.

Participants had a median major depressive disorder duration of 7.8 years and, on average, had tried three prior antidepressants. 

Overall mean baseline scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scale were 25.1, 33.0, and 4.8, respectively.

Study participants were randomly assigned to receive once-daily 1-mg liafensine, 2-mg liafensine, or placebo. The primary outcome was the change in MADRS scores (range, 0-60) at day 42 for the combined 1-mg and 2-mg doses.

Results showed a statistically significant mean difference of 4.4 points for the combined liafensine group over placebo (-15.4 vs -11.0; 95% CI, -7.6 to -1.3; P = .006).

The two liafensine doses separately demonstrated similar statistically significant MADRS improvements (mean treatment differences, -4.4 for 1 mg and -4.5 for 2 mg; P = .02 for both).

The standardized effect size was 0.42 for the combined liafensine group (0.41 for 1 mg and 0.44 for 2 mg), which the investigators said was clinically meaningful. 

Improvements in MADRS scores were observed in the first week of liafensine treatment, suggesting a rapid onset of symptom relief.

The trend for increased improvement over time “may suggest further improvement in efficacy with longer treatment,” the investigators noted.

Liafensine was also superior in all secondary endpoints at day 42, including changes on the CGI-S and CGI-Improvement scales.

The proportion of patients who reported at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was comparable between the liafensine group (57.3%) and the placebo group (56.3%). The most common TEAEs were nausea and headache, and most were tolerable.

In liafensine-treated patients, 4% discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 14.1% of those who received placebo. One patient taking liafensine died of an unknown cause.

None of the side effects commonly associated with the two drugs currently approved for TRD — Symbyax (olanzapine/fluoxetine, Eli Lilly and Company) and Spravato (esketamine, Janssen) — were observed, the investigators reported. These include dissociation, respiratory depression, movement disorders, and metabolic dysfunction with significant weight gain.

This, the investigators noted, suggests liafensine “represents the potential for an improved risk-benefit profile using precision medicine in ANK3-positive patients with TRD.” 

The results suggest “a single locus, if identified correctly, could be successfully used to predict antidepressant response, which represents major progress in advancing precision medicine in psychiatry,” the investigators wrote.

The 1-mg dose had comparable efficacy to the 2-mg dose and had better tolerability, so future studies will use the lower dose, they added.

The precise mechanism of how the ANK3 gene affects liafensine is likely related to the dopamine pathway but is not yet fully characterized. Although the 6-week study duration is consistent with FDA guidance for approval, long-term efficacy is yet to be tested.

The FDA granted Fast Track designation for developing liafensine to treat patients with TRD, and the company is moving ahead with a phase 3 study, Matthew A. Spear, MD, study investigator and chief medical officer/chief development officer for liafensine manufacturer Denovo Biopharma, told Medscape Medical News.

“We're discussing that with regulatory agencies,” said Spear. “That would serve as a second pivotal study, which would potentially allow liafensine to be approved.”

Commenting for Medscape Medical News, Philip Muskin, MD, professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City, said the findings underscore the potential of using genetic biomarkers to guide treatment in psychiatry, particularly with an agent that targets three neurotransmitter systems simultaneously.

Applying genetic profiles to determine which antidepressant works best for a particular patient represents the future of depression treatment, said Muskin. 

“When we talk about personalized medicine, this is pretty personal,” he said, adding that the study represents an important step toward precision medicine and could signal a future in which treatments are increasingly tailored to individual patients.

Muskin said he envisions a scenario in which a clinician takes a detailed history, prescribes an initial antidepressant, and then uses genetic testing results to guide the next treatment if the first is ineffective.

For now, clinicians would likely prescribe the first medication without waiting for genetic results until such tests become widely available, rapid, and affordable. Muskin noted that genetic analysis could potentially guide nondrug treatments as well, including behavioral approaches.

While he finds the results promising, Muskin also expressed some concerns about the study. He described the genome-wide scan used to identify a relevant response marker as a broad, “shotgun” approach and noted that it is somewhat surprising that researchers identified only one marker given the genetic complexity of depression. However, he also acknowledged that he is not a genetics expert.

He also questioned the assertion that the drug has an exceptionally favorable side effect profile. While this may be true for the limited number of study participants, broader use in larger populations could reveal additional side effects, Muskin said. He also noted that the differences in MADRS scores between the drug and placebo were statistically and clinically significant but not dramatic.

The study was funded by Denovo Biopharma. Spear reports employment, salary, and equity from Denovo Biopharma during the conduct of the study and outside the submitted work. Muskin reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

 September 15, 2025  

Of all the foods a child can be allergic to, egg is one of the most challenging due to its widespread and sometimes undetectable use in many products.

Yet, physicians must do detective work to figure out the best approach to treat egg allergy.

“We're relying on tons of different protocols that people are using and relying on products that are being purchased in the grocery store,” said Robert A. Wood, MD, professor of pediatric allergy and immunology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. “Both from the research standpoint and the clinical side, oral immunotherapy [OIT] has continued to grow, but it's a somewhat dissatisfying state that we're in.”

Some studies have estimated that 0.9% of children and 1.3% of children younger than 5 years have the allergy. In recent years, physicians have increasingly turned to OIT. But clinicians cannot rely on standardized protocols on OIT for egg allergy. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases advises against clinicians using allergen-specific immunotherapy for all food allergies, saying that the safety and therapeutic effect have not been proven. The guidelines, however, on the modality and emerging research on OIT have not been updated since first publishing in 2011.

Over a year ago, a task force was formed by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology and the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology to write immunotherapy guidelines that will provide more clarity for clinicians on OIT for food allergies. A spokesperson for the groups said no release date has been set.

“There isn't a manual that shows what dose and whether the powdered or baked egg approach will desensitize a child or teen,” said Scott H. Sicherer, MD, director of the Elliot and Roslyn Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.

In many cases, children will outgrow this condition, thus requiring careful assessments of needed treatment to reduce risk. Studies estimate that 4% of children will outgrow their allergy to egg by age 4 years, 37% by age 10 years, and 68% by age 16 years.

Like any treatment, OIT comes with risks, including anaphylaxis, gastrointestinal upset, and the development of eosinophilic esophagitis.

Much of the work published on OIT for egg is based on relatively small studies, often conducted at a single center, Wood said. The lack of larger trials leaves a lot of uncertainty in what a patient might consume for their immunotherapy, the risks, and the benefits.

Approaches for desensitizing children to eggs include exposure to extensively heated forms of egg or using small amounts of egg white powder.

Sicherer and co-authors over a decade ago published a seminal trial of children aged between 5 and 11 years who received up to 2 g of egg white powder per day in The New England Journal of Medicine. After 10 months, more than half passed an oral food challenge and were considered to be desensitized to egg. None of the children who received a placebo did so. Adverse reactions were oral or pharyngeal.

This year, other researchers published results in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global, testing a lower, 300-mg daily maintenance dose of egg white protein powder in 15 patients. By the end of the study, 53% of participants developed tolerance to the protein equivalent of a full egg.

Wood was the principal investigator of the OUtMATCH trial, which compared the drug omalizumab for several food allergies with a placebo. The FDA first approved omalizumab in 2003 for allergic asthma. The drug interferes with the harm that can be triggered by excessive immunoglobulin E, a culprit in some food allergies.

The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled children and adults who were allergic to peanuts and at least two other foods, including egg, milk, wheat, cashew, hazelnut, or walnut. While the trial's primary endpoint was reaction to peanuts, the drug also fared well on secondary endpoints based on reduced reaction to other allergens.

Among the 46 study participants with egg allergies, 31, or 67%, were able to consume a single dose of egg protein without moderate-to-severe allergic symptoms.

The results led the FDA in 2024 to approve omalizumab for certain cases of food allergy. Researchers are now studying whether this drug could be used in combination with immunotherapy.

A parents' commitment to OIT can be critical to success in treating egg allergy, said Jonathan Tam, MD, medical director of the Gores Family Allergy Center at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles.

Opting for this approach means parents must enforce what can be burdensome restrictions on the child. These include not running after taking their dose, often for a period of 2 hours. Parents also need to be prepared to have someone watch the child for reactions.

Clinicians must educate parents and children on what to expect. Desensitization can take months, without a guarantee of complete success, Tam said.

“There is a lot of misunderstanding about it; a lot of people go into it with an idea like, ‘This is an absolute cure and it's easy,'” Tam said.

Allergists said many parents will seek out research on solutions for their children, including OIT. Some may consider trying the protocols at home, without fully understanding potential risks.

With that in mind, pediatricians should make clear to parents the need for supervised care of their children in addressing allergies, Sicherer said.

“Parents might be tempted to try it on their own,” Sicherer told Medscape Medical News. “I emphasize, ‘Do not try this at home.'”

Wood reported receiving funding from Aimmune, ALK, DBV, Genentech, Novartis, Siolta, and Aravax, and consulting fees from Genentech. Tam has been a speaker for ARS Pharma. Sicherer reported having no relevant financial disclosures.

Invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) affect approximately 1 in 50 patients with complicated alcohol-related hepatitis (CAH) and are associated with a more than fourfold increase in mortality risk.

“These findings support the urgent need for evidence-based guidelines on systematic screening and risk-adapted antifungal prophylaxis in CAH,” the authors of the study wrote, adding that, “bacterial pneumonia may serve as a clinical sentinel for fungal superinfection.”

The study was led by Charlotte Mouliade, MD, AP-HP. Centre, Groupe Hospitalier Cochin Port Royal, DMU Cancérologie et Spécialités Médico-Chirurgicales, Service Des Maladies du Foie, Paris, France. It was published online in Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

IFDs were identified via diagnostic codes rather than microbiologic/histopathologic confirmation, which could underestimate actual prevalence. Precise timing for key clinical events (diagnosis of CAH, corticosteroid initiation, IFD onset) was unavailable, as was information on antifungal/antibiotic therapies.

No study funding was reported. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

Mustafa Sahin, MD, PhD, Neurologist-in-Chief and Chair of the Department of Neurology at Boston Children's Hospital, and his collaborators have been awarded an NIH grant of over $8.6 million for the third five-year cycle of the Rare Disease Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) project, ""Developmental Synaptopathies Associated with TSC, PTEN, SHANK3, and SynGAP1 Pathogenic Variants"".

This grant, which now involves 13 hospitals across the United States, aims to continue the comprehensive characterization of individuals with these rare diseases, focusing on cognition, communication, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The project also seeks to develop neurophysiological biomarkers of sleep and sensory deficits, support pilot projects through strategic disorder-specific priorities, and foster a new generation of skilled investigators. Additionally, efforts to expand the research activities and effective dissemination of information, and plan for the consortium's sustainability beyond RDCRN funding will also be a main focus of the next five years. This initiative represents a significant step forward in both rare disease research and patient advocacy. 

Our work with many institutions across the United States and partnership with many patient advocacy groups to date have brought several clinical intervention trials to these rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorders. Our infrastructure and experience also provide a roadmap for comparative analysis across conditions with the goal of providing more therapeutic opportunities for these rare disease communities.""

Older patients susceptible to chronic neurological conditions are willing to use wearables for remote monitoring to support their health and well-being at home. Conducted at the University of Eastern Finland, a recent study found that older patients are open to using wearable smart rings and view themselves as active contributors to their own care. The possibility for caregivers to access patient data collected was seen as reassuring and motivating, providing a sense of safety and guidance.

The study was conducted at Kuopio University Hospital and involved interviews with patients. Patients were asked about their perceptions and expectations of the Oura Ring, a Finnish-designed smart ring originally created for wellness tracking but also being considered for health monitoring purposes. Patients appreciated the small size and comfortable design of the ring compared to wrist-worn devices. However, they also raised questions about the durability of the ring, data accuracy, privacy and who would access the information.

The study stresses the need to involve patients early in the design and implementation of digital health solutions to ensure that technologies are acceptable, user-friendly and supportive of long-term engagement.

Listening to patients at the pre-implementation stage provides crucial insights for adopting effective and meaningful remote monitoring solutions. For healthcare professionals, this means being prepared to integrate user-friendly tools into older adults' care where appropriate, while also addressing concerns about devices, data protection and the benefits of continuous monitoring.""

A pioneering international project led by prominent female scientists, involving research staff from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M) and promoted by the Spanish Space Agency (AEE), has just completed its parabolic flight campaign in Bordeaux (France). Its main objective is to study and counteract the adverse effects of microgravity on the human body, a key challenge for future exploration of the Moon and Mars.

The research is led by Professor Ana Díaz Artiles, from Texas A&M University (TAMU, USA) and honorary professor in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at UC3M. Her team tested an innovative countermeasure to protect the cardiovascular and ocular health of astronauts on long-duration missions.

The results of this research will not only be crucial for the future of human space exploration, but could also have important applications on Earth, such as in the treatment of vascular diseases and cardiovascular rehabilitation.""

Ana Díaz Artiles, Professor, Texas A&M University, USA

This project marks a milestone due to its approach and its team members, which include a notable number of women and Spanish participants. Participants include: Sara García Alonso, reserve astronaut for the European Space Agency (ESA); Isabel Vera Trallero, director of the Office of Space and Society at the Spanish Space Agency; and Beatriz Puente-Espada, director of the Aerospace Medicine Training Center (CIMA) of the Air and Space Force. The Spanish team is completed by: Professor Óscar Flores Arias, director of the Department of Aerospace Engineering at UC3M; master's student Huc Pentinat Llurba at TAMU; and the participation of the National Institute of Aerospace Technology (INTA).

During space missions, the absence of gravity gradients causes a redistribution of body fluids towards the head, which can cause vision problems, increased intracranial pressure, and increased risk of blood clots in the neck. To combat these effects, the team tested a technique called Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP), which applies negative pressure to the legs to redistribute fluids back to the lower body and normalize circulation.""The most interesting thing about this project is that we are evaluating such a promising countermeasure as LBNP in real microgravity conditions. This will allow us to analyze the effectiveness of LBNP in protecting the ocular and cardiovascular health of astronauts, two of the major challenges of long-duration space missions,"" says Oscar Flores. In addition to marking a turning point in protecting the health of astronauts, ""the validation of the LBNP technique may also open the door to medical applications here on Earth"" he adds.Throughout the parabolic flight, the effectiveness of this technique will be analyzed by measuring blood circulation in the neck and other cardiovascular and ocular parameters. This collaborative effort is an example of global research with renowned partners in the US, such as the University of California, Davis, and the University of Florida. The project is funded by ESA, NASA, TAMU, and Lockheed Martin Corporation, underscoring its international importance.

                Bellingham included in the 23-man Real Madrid UCL squad.            

After a tormenting injury lay-off, Jude Bellingham has made his highly anticipated return to the Real Madrid setup. The 22-year-old has been included in the Los Blancos squad for their 2025-26 UEFA Champions League opener against Olympique de Marseille. After numerous weeks of intense recovery and rehabilitation, the England international superstar will rejoin the men in white – hoping to continue their strong start to the campaign.

Bellingham joined Real Madrid in June 2023, with huge aspirations to win the La Liga and Champions League crowns. In one of the groundbreaking deals at the time, Real Madrid signed the prodigious talent on a six-year contract. In his first season with the Spanish giants, Bellingham tore the league apart. Completing the league + UCL double, Bellingham's supremely impressive stats made the then manager Carlo Ancelotti term him “a veteran.”

With 36 goals and 24 assists to his name, Jude Bellingham is well and truly a key inclusion in the Real Madrid midfield. Slotting in as an attacking midfielder and an occasional false-nine, Xabi Alonso will be delighted that the Englishman has returned to match fitness.

On Monday, Real Madrid confirmed that Jude Bellingham has been included in the match-day squad for their upcoming UEFA Champions League group stage match against Marseille. He completed training with the team for the first time since his shoulder injury which kept him out after the FIFA Club World Cup. Initially expected to return only in October, Bellingham's recovery has gone better than expected.

The box-to-box midfielder suffered a shoulder dislocation during Real Madrid's encounter against Rayo Vallecano in November 2023. He played through the initial knock, until the discomfort worsened to a large extent. After the Club World Cup in July 2025, Bellingham underwent surgery in London to address the recurring pain in his shoulder. Yet, the road to recovery has been more than successful for the midfielder – as Real Madrid said ‘Hey Jude' by welcoming their pivotal cog back to the 23-man squad to face Marseille on Wednesday.

Will Real Madrid continue their invincible start to the 2025-26 outing after Jude Bellingham's return? Only time will tell.

The Kansas City Council approved a “temporary pause on permit fees” for sidewalk cafes, street cafes and mini park spaces for dining establishments and will help in offering more attractive spaces for resident and visitors for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, according to Chris Higgins of the K.C. STAR. The pause will last three years and could “save restaurants $850 in fees annually while potentially boosting their sales.” Officials also said that will “help clear a barrier for small businesses, particularly those in areas with fewer resources, while increasing economic activity and tax revenue for the city” (K.C. STAR, 9/15). 

WATCHDOGS: In Atlanta, Matt Reynolds noted as Atlanta readies for the World Cup, a new coalition called Play Fair ATL is vowing to hold officials accountable for their promises on housing, along with the rights of immigrants and workers.

                        For the World Cup in Philly next summer, Lemon Hill Park will host the five-week FIFA Fan Festival with watch parties, food vendors and other activities for soccer fans. City officials have been working to enhance the park ahead of the World Cup. Above, a rendering of the festival grounds. 
                    

With about eight months before Philadelphia hosts its first World Cup 2026 match, work is underway to get Lemon Hill Park ready for thousands of soccer fans expected to attend watch parties at the FIFA Fan Festival next summer. 

The historic section of Fairmount Park, formerly a 19th century estate on the east side of the Schuylkill River, was chosen last year as the designated space for a free-to-attend, five-week festival that will run the course of the World Cup from June 11 to July 19. The site will have big screen monitors to watch matches, activity stations and vendors selling food and merchandise.

Although the city's five World Cup matches will be played at Lincoln Financial Field, in South Philly, Lemon Hill Park was picked as the festival grounds because of its sweeping views of Center City, city officials said. Planners hope the atmosphere will resemble Brazil's beaches and Germany's town squares during past World Cups. 

The roughly 46-acre area is getting a series of upgrades to make the space more inviting and accessible. People who visit the park in the coming months can expect to see a range of construction activity, road closures and detours. 

The existing pathway up the hill at the park will be replaced, allowing it to be reseeded as a green space. The Streets Department also will make improvements to about 1,700 feet of sidewalks along Sedgley Drive, Poplar Drive and Girard Avenue. Twelve new ADA-compliant ramps will be constructed at the park, including two at the mid-block crossing on Sedgley Avenue near the basketball court. 

Resurfacing work will take place at the Lemon Hill Mansion parking lot and along Sedgley Drive, Poplar Drive and Lemon Hill Drive. Temporary parking restrictions will be in place during milling, paving and line striping activity. Several corners also will get curb realignments and bump-outs to calm traffic, reduce crossing distances and improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists. 

The Philadelphia Water Department also plans to install drinking water stations in multiple areas of Lemon Hill Park. Other park upgrades include improved electrical service and the installation of security cameras. 

Philadelphia is one of 16 World Cup host cities in the the United States, Canada and Mexico. FIFA's expanded format in 2026 will feature 104 matches over 39 days, headlined by a new knockout round of 32 national teams that will be drawn from the best of 12 groups of four teams.

Lincoln Financial Field will have group-stage matches on June 14, 19, 22, 25 and 27. One Round of 16 match will be played there on July 4, coinciding with the city's celebration of the nation's 250th birthday. Specific matches in the group stage will not be known until after FIFA's World Cup draw in December. 

The festival at Lemon Hill Park is part of a busy summer schedule in Philadelphia, where Citizens Bank Park is slated to host the 2026 MLB All-Star Game on July 14. 

FIFA opened up its first ticket presale for World Cup matches last week, inviting Visa cardholders to enter a lottery-style drawing to gain early access to tickets. Two more lotteries will open to the general public before the end of the year, and the general ticket sale will start in the spring. 

The Lemon Hill estate was purchased by the city in 1844 and became the first piece of land used to create Fairmount Park when it was formally dedicated to the public in 1855. The improvements taking place ahead of the FIFA Fan Fest are part of a long-term plan to revitalize Lemon Hill Park, including the development of a new playground after the World Cup.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Forget rent — Zohran Mamdani's latest fight is with $6,000 tickets for World Cup","https://fortune.com/2025/09/15/zohran-mamdani-fifa-world-cup-6000-tickets-greed/","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 15:01:00 GMT","

New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, who won the Democratic nomination on a platform of making the city more affordable, is now calling on soccer's global governing body to make it cheaper for New Yorkers to attend the World Cup.

In a petition released Wednesday, Mamdani demanded FIFA reverse its plan to set ticket prices for next year's tournament based on demand, likening the practice to “price gouging.”





The Democratic socialist, who dubbed his campaign “Game Over Greed,” also called for 15% of tickets to be set aside at discounted prices for residents.





“As a lifelong football — sorry, I mean soccer fan, I couldn't be more excited,” Mamdani said in an accompanying social media video, affecting a faux-British accent as he juggled a soccer ball in his dress shoes. “But are any working-class New Yorkers actually going to be able to watch any of the matches?”





The tournament will be played across 16 cities in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Eight matches, including the final, will be held at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, a short train ride away from New York City.




“So many of our neighbors will not be able to afford to be there,” Mamdani added, accusing FIFA of “pricing working people out of the game that they love.”





A spokesperson for FIFA said the adoption of dynamic pricing reflects the market practices of the host countries.





As with past years, some tickets will be set aside for “specific fan categories” at fixed prices, according to the spokesperson, who noted the details around eligibility and pricing were still being worked out.





In recent days, FIFA's plan to adopt a dynamic pricing model — similar to the one used by airlines or hotels — has sparked controversy among some fans.





Tickets will start at $60 for group-stage matches and increase to $6,730 for the final, officials said last week, but could fluctuate under the demand-based pricing model.




Mamdani also called on the governing body to implement a cap on resale ticket prices — something it has agreed to do in Mexico, but not in the United States or Canada. A spokesperson for FIFA said the cap on resale prices in Mexico was a result of the country's strict laws around secondary ticket markets.





Mamdani, who surged to victory in the primary based on promises such as freezing rent for New Yorkers and making buses free, situated the World Cup fight as part of his larger battle against rising costs for working people.





“Pope John Paul II said, ‘Of all the unimportant things, football is the most important,'” he said at a press conference Wednesday. “This is part and parcel of a larger affordability crisis in this city. Once again, it will be working people who will be left behind.”

It is not every day the record-holder for weeks at No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings is in the stands for a match, but that is exactly what happened Sunday in Athens.

Novak Djokovic was in attendance with his son, Stefan, for the Davis Cup tie between home side Greece and Brazil. The 100-time tour-level titlist watched Joao Fonseca seal Brazil's victory against Stefanos Tsitsipas.

Tsitsipas led Fonseca 5-3 in the deciding set and had an opportunity to serve for the match, which would have led to a deciding fifth rubber. Instead, #NextGenATP star Fonseca won the final four games of the match for a 6-4, 3-6, 7-5 victory against the former World No. 3.



It was the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. Fonseca had already defeated Stefanos Sakellaridis 7-5, 6-3 to begin the tie, and Tsitsipas had eased past Thiago Seyboth Wild 6-2, 6-1.

Rafael Matos and Marcelo Melo put Fonseca in position to close out the tie with a 6-2, 6-2 victory against Aristotelis Thanos and Petros Tsitsipas.

Jessica Pegula's back was spasming up during her US Open quarterfinal match against Barbora Krejcikova, so she took an uncharacteristic bathroom break and did some emergency crunches on the bathroom floor.

Champions do whatever it takes to win, right?

Even if that means doing emergency crunches on a bathroom floor.

That's exactly what World No. 7 Jessica Pegula did halfway through her quarterfinal win over Barbora Krejcikova at the US Open.

As she explained on The Player's Box podcast -- which she hosts alongside Madison Keys, Jennifer Brady and Desirae Krawczyk -- Pegula has been dealing with sacroiliac joint issues since Wimbledon, and it cropped up when she was up 4-3 in the first set.

A post shared by The Players Box (@theplayersboxpod)

After closing it out 6-3, the 31-year-old took a bathroom break -- which she never does -- threw some towels on the bathroom floor in Arthur Ashe Stadium and began knocking out crunches and core exercises to unlock her back.

""I needed to lay down on the floor and do some core exercises because my back was spasming up,"" Pegula explained. ""It wasn't to the point where I couldn't play, but I was like, 'Oh s***!' So I did core and glute activation stuff.""

The crunches proved effective, because Pegula returned to Ashe -- the world not knowing she had been lying on a bathroom floor moments earlier -- and took the second set 6-3 to advance to the semifinals.

""After, my coaches were like, 'We were wondering if you were OK, if you ate something or something was wrong,'"" Pegula said. ""I was like, 'No, my back just really locked up on me and I had to do some core.'""

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Pegula gave eventual champion Aryna Sabalenka a run for her money in the semis, taking the first set, but lost the next two in what was still a highly productive fortnight in New York.

The American will be representing the United States this week at the Billie Jean King Cup Finals in Shenzhen, China. She'll then play the WTA 1000 China Open, in Beijing, next week, and is scheduled to play the Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open in October.

But redemption was on the line against Medvedev, who himself was looking for his first win of the week after losing in a match tiebreaker to Tiafoe on Day 2.

“I wanted to redeem myself after this morning,” Shelton said. “Obviously I lost my singles yesterday and I didn't want to come out of here winless, I thought I was playing too well.“I really used my guys on the bench today, and the captain John of course really helped me get over the line,” added the American, referring to seven-time Laver Cup captain John McEnroe.Medvedev nearly went off the boil in the first-set tiebreaker, bouncing his racquet into the stands in a moment that nearly saw the former No. 1 defaulted. Though Medvedev calmed down in time to take the tiebreaker, it was Shelton who took momentum into the second and subsequent Sudden Death, playing aggressive tennis to hand Medvedev an 0-2 record in singles play.Team World was ultimately unable to consolidate Shelton's lead as Team Europe won the final two matches of the tournament: Alexander Zverev and Carlos Alcaraz overcame tough challenges from both Tiafoe and Taylor Fritz to clinch a 13-11 win over Team World.📲 🖥️ Watch the 2025 Laver Cup beginning Friday, September 19, on the Tennis Channel app

Shelton looked to be a key player for Team World in 2025, but the American was ruled out of the event after suffering a shoulder injury that forced him to retire from the US Open.“A small setback like this, yeah, it hurt,” said Shelton, who won his first Masters 1000 title at the National Bank Open in August. “I was playing really well, I was in form, a lot of confidence. Just so many things to be happy with the way that I was playing, moving on the court, competing.“But like I said, it's been a great summer, a lot of things to be thankful for. You won't hear me over here pouting about how bad things are with the summer that I've had, the things that I've been able to do in this sport in a short amount of time and the people I got around me, like I said, a lot of blessings.”

David Coulthard on McLaren team orders

Trailer: F1 Memory Box with David Coulthard

From McLaren's Constructors' Championship bid to Red Bull's form – here are the big stories ahead of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in Baku.

With the European swing of races now complete, it's time for the 2025 Formula 1 season to enter its final third. Sixteen races down, eight still to go, and the remaining flyaway rounds kick off with a visit to Baku, which can often be a chaotic weekend...

So much of the focus this season has been on the battle between the two McLaren drivers, as Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris duel it out for the Drivers' Championship in what has become a two-driver race.

With both performing at such a high level – seven wins for Piastri, five for Norris, and seven 1-2s within that – the byproduct of such impressive point-scoring is McLaren have a significant lead over the chasing pack in the Constructors' Championship. So significant, in fact, that they could wrap up the title this weekend in Baku.

A combined finish of first and second, or first and third, would be enough for McLaren to become champions regardless of what second-placed Ferrari do, while beyond that they just have to outscore the Scuderia by nine points. If they manage to do that, then as long as they don't lose 12 points to Mercedes, or 33 points to Red Bull, then McLaren will be champions.

Should the title be secured this weekend, it would mark the earliest point in a season that it has been won, with seven rounds still remaining after the trip to Azerbaijan.

Constructors' Championship ahead of Baku

Despite standing on the verge of winning a championship, McLaren were actually beaten for the first time in six races at Monza, and it wasn't by their nearest title chasers.

Ferrari were victorious at their home race a year ago, but this time around it was Red Bull who took the win, with the result marking a significant turnaround in fortunes at Monza over the past 12 months.

From being over half a minute adrift of the race-winner in 2024, Max Verstappen beat the two McLarens by over 19 seconds this time around to secure his third win of the season. It was Verstappen's first win since the other Italian round in Imola – a run of nine races.

While Verstappen appears too far back in the title fight to hold any realistic ambitions of his own, he could still be a major factor if Red Bull can replicate their Monza pace at any other venues. A new floor introduced last time out delivered a step forward, but both Verstappen and Red Bull pointed to setup choices as particularly significant.

Baku will provide a very different challenge and was another track that Verstappen struggled at a year ago as Red Bull's form declined, so this weekend will give us further evidence of whether Monza was a one-off due to the unique track characteristics, or if McLaren could face more regular opposition from the defending champion.

Italian rookie Kimi Antonelli has enjoyed very strong support from Mercedes throughout his career so far, both during his junior years and since making the step up to race for the team alongside George Russell this year.

That support remains, but team principal Toto Wolff was the most critical we have heard him be towards Antonelli after the Italian Grand Prix, a race weekend that Wolff described as “underwhelming”.

Antonelli spun off during FP2 and then struggled at times to make progress through traffic during the race itself, picking up a penalty for forcing Alex Albon off track – described by the stewards as “erratic driving” – as he was classified ninth.

That was actually Antonelli's best result of a difficult European part of the season, with his only other score coming courtesy of a tenth place in Hungary. So the return to tracks in different parts of the world could actually mark a change in form for the 19-year-old.

The last time he raced outside Europe, in Canada, he was on the podium for the first time, and the Italian has previously said he was putting too much pressure on himself to perform on European tracks he knows. Baku was a happy hunting ground in F2 for Antonelli last year as he secured a feature race podium, and offers the chance to reset after Monza.

Not for the first time this season, we're entering a race weekend with a driver within just two penalty points of being banned for an event. And while Ollie Bearman should be reflecting positively on the anniversary of his racing debut for Haas, he is the driver who is most at risk.

It was actually a race ban for Kevin Magnussen – earned when he exceeded the 12 penalty point limit at Monza a year ago – that opened the door for Bearman to drive at Baku in 2024, and he duly took it by securing a point in tenth place. That made Bearman the first driver in F1 history to score points in his first two races for two different teams.

But this year, he arrives in a similar situation to Magnussen. A penalty earned at Monza – for causing a collision with Carlos Sainz – leaves Bearman with 10 penalty points on his licence. Two more would trigger an automatic one-race ban, a tightrope that Bearman will have to walk until after the Mexico City Grand Prix in four races' time.

The penalty points system, and penalties in general, could become a talking point among the drivers this weekend, after Williams managed to successfully overturn Sainz's penalty regarding his collision with Liam Lawson in Zandvoort. The team said the decision to request a right of review was “important for us to understand how to go racing in future”, and the stewards agreed new footage showed it was a racing incident, leading to the rescinding of penalty points Sainz was given.

The Azerbaijan Grand Prix has become a bit of a fan favourite during its relatively short time on the Formula 1 calendar, with its eight editions so far generally taking on one of two guises. There have been a few largely incident free runs to the flag, or there have been some extremely dramatic races.

Drivers appeared to play it safe for the inaugural race in Baku back in 2016, expecting to bank a good result if they stayed out of trouble based on extremely chaotic support races. When that led to little in the way of incidents, the approach changed a year later for what was perhaps the most chaotic race of the lot in 2017.

There was plenty of drama in 2021, too, while last year's race also provided brilliant action courtesy of a thrilling fight for the win between Oscar Piastri and Charles Leclerc, and a last-lap collision between Carlos Sainz and Sergio Perez.

Baku's extremely tight and twisty castle section, paired with an extremely long flat-out run at the end of the lap, creates a unique challenge of a high speed street circuit with plenty of overtaking potential, while also punishing mistakes.

David Coulthard on McLaren team orders

Trailer: F1 Memory Box with David Coulthard

David Coulthard is the next Grand Prix personality to feature as F1 TV's ‘F1 Memory Box' series continues.

Another new and exclusive series is available on F1 TV this year with the launch of F1 Memory Box, which involves legends of the sport sharing memories from their story-filled careers via previously unseen footage.

After the late, great Eddie Jordan opened the show, it was David Coulthard's turn to sit down for a chat with host Tom Clarkson – going back to where it all started at Williams, reflecting on his title-challenging years at McLaren and much, much more.

There are video clips the Scotsman has never seen before and stories he has never told before while looking back on an F1 journey that spanned almost 250 starts, and yielded 13 Grand Prix wins, through the 1990s and 2000s.

One standout example (in the video clip below) is Coulthard's recollection of the pit stop confusion and McLaren team orders situation at the 1998 Australian Grand Prix, where team mate Mika Hakkinen took victory in controversial circumstances.

Check out a trailer for Coulthard's ‘F1 Memory Box' episode by hitting go on the video player at the top of the page, with news on future instalments to follow soon.

The award-winning Formula 1 Exhibition will opens its doors at the world-renowned Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre in November.

The award-winning Formula 1 Exhibition will make its long-awaited Asia-Pacific debut when it opens its doors at the world-renowned Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre in Australia on 29 November 2025.

Following hugely successful runs in Madrid, Vienna, Toronto, London, Buenos Aires, and most recently Amsterdam – where the show was extended due to overwhelming popular demand – Melbourne will become the eighth city to host the critically acclaimed show after the recently announced F1 Exhibition in Oberhausen, Germany.

Known for its headline sporting and cultural events, Melbourne has been a hub for Formula 1 since 1996. The Australian Grand Prix remains one of the highlights of the season, and with a long-term agreement in place, F1 will continue to race at Albert Park for years to come.

F1 Exhibition will pay homage to Australia's rich motorsport heritage, with the show celebrating former World Champions Jack Brabham and Alan Jones, past race winners Mark Webber and Daniel Ricciardo, as well as current title contender Oscar Piastri.

The show will offer fans the ultimate immersive experience, with exclusive archive content, interviews with some of the sport's biggest icons and historic memorabilia. Other highlights include F1 cars from different eras, interactive installations that showcase the technology behind Formula 1, and a dedicated room paying homage to Australia's racing history.

Fans will also get a chance to race around the iconic Albert Park circuit in state-of-the-art F1 driving simulators.

The Melbourne edition will start with Once Upon A Time In Formula 1, a gallery of previously unpublished photos, films, artefacts and numerous interviews with F1's most famous personalities, taking visitors through some of the most popular and defining moments in the sport's history.

Guests then move onto the Design Lab which gives a rare insight into the development of an F1 car and shows how the teams design and produce new components for their cars. The room takes fans inside an F1 factory, and features contributions from Pirelli, Williams, McLaren, Red Bull, Mercedes, and Kick Sauber.

Drivers and Duels tells the stories of legendary drivers and rivalries, with highlights including the Hall of Fame, which features over 60 helmets and the most iconic race suits from Formula 1's 75-year history. Revolution By Design explores the sport's groundbreaking innovations and the future of F1, with contributions from Lotus, McLaren, Ferrari, Mercedes, Honda, and F1 ACADEMY's Managing Director Susie Wolff, plus more.

Visitors then enter Survival, where previously unseen remains of parts of Romain Grosjean's burnt out Haas car – including the steering wheel and a tyre – and his boots and gloves from his dramatic 2020 crash in Bahrain will be displayed. The show then reaches its climax at The Pit Wall – a cinematic and immersive experience that allows fans to relive the greatest moments in Formula 1 history.

Details of a seventh room dedicated to the significant contribution Australia has made to motorsport will be revealed in the coming weeks.

Emily Prazer, Chief Commercial Officer at Formula 1, said: “Every time Formula 1 comes to Melbourne we feel the passion for the sport throughout this amazing city, so it's only fitting for it to be the destination for the first F1 Exhibition in Asia-Pacific.

""The show celebrates the sport's rich history and Australia's outstanding contribution to Formula 1. I'm really excited for fans to go on an incredible immersive journey through our sport's most memorable moments.”

“I apologize for that extremely callous remark,” the ‘Fox and Friends' host said during Sunday's broadcast. 


							By 

	Lexy Perez


Associate Editor


Fox and Friends host Brian Kilmeade has issued an apology for comments he made last Wednesday about the mentally ill homeless when discussing the death of Iryna Zarutska. 


	During a Wednesday broadcast of Fox and Friends, Kilmeade was having a discussion with co-hosts Lawrence Jones and Ainsley Earhardt about Zarutska, the 23-year-old Ukrainian woman was stabbed and killed on a train in North Carolina in August. The assailant reportedly had former convictions and a record of mental illness. 




	During their conversation, Jones addressed public money being spent to attempt to help mentally ill homeless people and suggested that those who didn't accept the offered services should be jailed. Kilmeade then added, “Or involuntary lethal injection, or something. Just kill ‘em.”

	Kilmeade's comments sparked controversy, leaving the host to speak out about them during Sunday's broadcast. In his apology, Kilmeade referred to his comments as “callous.”  


	“In the morning, we were discussing the murder of Iryna Zarutska in Charlotte, North Carolina and how to stop these kinds of attacks by homeless, mentally ill assailants, including institutionalizing or jailing such people so they cannot attack again,” he said. “Now during that discussion, I wrongly said they should get lethal injections. I apologize for that extremely callous remark. I am obviously aware that not all mentally ill, homeless people act as the perpetrator did in North Carolina and that so many homeless people deserve our empathy and compassion.”

	The Justice Department has charged Decarlos Brown Jr., the man accused of fatally stabbing the Ukrainian refugee on a North Carolina commuter train last month. As reported by the Associated Press, the case has sparked a debate over whether cities such as Charlotte are adequately addressing violent crime, mental illness and transit safety. 


	“Iryna Zarutska was a young woman living the American dream — her horrific murder is a direct result of failed soft-on-crime policies that put criminals before innocent people,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement of the murder. “We will seek the maximum penalty for this unforgivable act of violence — he will never again see the light of day as a free man.”

Billboard attended the invite-only gala, and spoke with Meek Mill, Michael Rubin and Jessica Jackson along the way.

	To the untrained eye, it seems like just any other weekend inside Atlantic City's Ocean Casino Resort. The last trickle of summer tourists meander the casino halls, lounge by the pool, and hit the beach's boardwalk in a desperate attempt to soak up one of the last steamy weekends of the year. But on Saturday (Sept. 13), half of Hollywood quietly descended on the resort for the REFORM Alliance Casino Night and Gala, one of the year's most sumptuous fundraisers and parties in support of REFORM's efforts to transform probation and parole in America.

	As the plethora of stars — including Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Kevin Hart, Travis Scott, Ice Spice, Machine Gun Kelly, Quavo, DJ Khaled, Latto, Emma Roberts, Jamie Foxx, French Montana and Ne-Yo — all made their way into the resort's Ovation Hall, they were handed fizzling glasses of Armand de Brignac, while other attendees sipped on spicy D'USSÉ Sidecars or warm, comforting Espresso Martini's. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Foxx reunited with his Back in Action co-star Cameron Diaz, laughing and gabbing the night away while Foxx's towering Buffalo Hat shielded his face from nosy onlookers (like Billboard). Robert Kraft — sandwiched in between Travis Scott and his fellow REFORM Alliance Board Member Michael Rubin — shared hushed conversations with both. Kraft would later bid almost a million dollars for a round of golf with his old friend Tom Brady, who during the night's scheduled auction appeared illuminated on the stage via Zoom to oversee the bidding war.

	











	That round of golf, which would be played at Michael Jordan's private Grove XXIII golf club, would actually go for $1.8 million. Elsewhere, an exclusive concert from Megan Thee Stallion and a one-of-one linen George Condo painting would soon after sell for $600,000 and a whopping $3.4 million, much at the teasing and baiting of the evening's host Kevin Hart.


	“It's a round of golf, Tiffany,” Hart called out at one point to Tiffany Haddish, who put up a good fight to try and secure herself a 9-hole game with the seven-time Super Bowl champ. “It's not a date with Tom Brady!”


	Elsewhere in the auction, a painting by Rashid Johnson, titled “Soul Painting for Freedom,” sold for over a million, while another bidding war ensued for an Audemars Piguet timepiece made exclusively for Jay-Z, who sat alongside his wife Beyoncé in the middle of the banquet hall.


	Money was spent, drinks were poured, belly laughs echoed through the halls. Yet while the evening felt like an aristocratic dinner with some of today's biggest stars, there were solemn reminders along the way about the true impact at play with REFORM's work.


	“The mission hasn't changed,” Meek Mill told Billboard, drink in hand outside the gala in a neatly tailored black tie ensemble. “We've changed about 22 laws and statutes in a bunch of states. I think the goal is just to keep going. We're gonna one day talk about the people in the system that need jobs, so eventually we'll venture over to that. But right now we're focusing on parol and probation by going state to state, we've done eight or nine states so far.”


	Since REFORM's inception in 2019 — which started after Meek Mill's controversial parole violation in 2017 when he popped a wheelie on his dirt bike and received a two-to-four year prison sentence —  the non-profit has passed 22 bills in 12 states aimed at curtailing the supervision-to-prison pipeline and the supervision-to-poverty trap that effects millions of ex-convicts.

	











	One of those impacted individuals, James Severe, spoke onstage prior to the auction, and grew emotional as he shared his own struggles within the prison system and how REFORM's efforts changed his life. Regardless of these heartwarming stories, it's hard to ignore whether the second Trump Administration will value criminal justice reform in the same way as REFORM itself.


	“I think overall, no,” Rubin said when Billboard asked if criminal justice reform was as unifying a topic as it used to be. “But for what we do at REFORM, absolutely. This is the one place people aren't debating. People know we need to fix this. There are a lot of parts of criminal justice reform people don't agree with, but I think the mission here has been clear since we started.”


	However, REFORM's CEO Jessica Jackson added that since the nonprofit's last gala in 2023 they'd passed five new bills, including the groundbreaking Act 44 in Meek's home state of Pennsylvania, which eases the more draconian aspects of Pennsylvania's restrictive probation system. This movement alone shows there is some bipartisan flexibility on this issue.


	“I think because of the way REFORM Alliance does our work, where we actually sit down with key stakeholders from all across the aisle — business leaders, faith leaders, law enforcement — we have been able to find that people on all sides of the aisle really think there needs to be reform, that there needs to be common sense injected into [the system],” Jackson added. “Our biggest obstacle has just been the ability to really get out there. But the incredible news is that as we've been passing these bills, we've been working on implementing them, and part of that involves collecting data. What we've found is our bills work. They make communities safer. They save states money. They promote human dignity.”

	











	“I'm not really deep in the political world but we have always had Republicans and Democrats working with REFORM,” Meek noted. “I don't know what the level of political change will be.”


	After the auction, The Weeknd floated on stage to perform some of his biggest hits, including “Starboy,” “The Hills” “Timeless” and more. Along the way, Abel took shots of whiskey, shouted out Quavo and kept the vibes light and celebratory for his 40-minute set. The night was then capped off by a high-stakes, closed-door Blackjack tournament at Ocean's Gallery Bark Book & Games area. Hov, French Montana, Taylor Rooks, Tyrese Haliburton and guest Andrew Ramus all emerged as semi-finalists, with the latter winning the coveted $1 million prize. Along the way, Travis Scott, Ice Spice, Quavo, DJ Khaled and Chase B performed, before all the guests choppered off to the night's afterparty. 


	Overall, the high-energy event was a blockbuster success, raising over $20 million for criminal justice reform for the second time.

The rapper has pleaded not guilty to felony charges stemming from a strange naked walk in Los Angeles.

Lil Nas X has entered an inpatient treatment program after being arrested and hit with felony charges for allegedly attacking police officers and resisting arrest while wandering naked in Los Angeles.


	Lawyers for Lil Nas (Montero Hill) appeared in Los Angeles court on Monday (Sept. 15), but the 26-year-old musician was notably absent. Judge Shellie Samuels stated that Lil Nas is “in treatment” outside of California.


	“We're not going to get specific about where he is,” said the judge. “It's private, nobody needs to know where he is, but he is in treatment.”

	Judge Samuels left Lil Nas' bail at $75,000 and modified the conditions of his release so he can remain out of state. The rapper's next court date is set for Nov. 18.


	After the hearing, defense attorney Drew Findling spoke to press outside the courthouse and said they do not yet know when Lil Nas will be released from treatment. Findling did not specify the nature of his treatment program.


	“We're doing what is best for Montero from a personal standpoint, and a professional standpoint, but most importantly for his well-being,” said Findling. “He is surrounded by an amazing family, an amazing team of people that care about him and love him, and we're just addressing those issues. It's really as simple as that. He's had a great life, he'll continue to have a great life. This is a bump that he's gonna get over.”


	Lil Nas was arrested in the early hours of Aug. 21 in Los Angeles' Studio City neighborhood. The rapper was captured on video wandering the streets wearing only underwear and cowboy boots, and he allegedly charged at police officers who were attempting to take him into custody.


	After a brief hospitalization, Lil Nas was booked in jail. He spent the weekend in custody before being charged with three felony counts of battery with injury to a police officer and a fourth felony count of resisting arrest.


	Lil Nas pled not guilty to the charges and was granted bail on Aug. 25. He posted on Instagram the next day, saying the encounter was “f—king terrifying” but assuring fans, “Your girl is gonna be all right.”


	The rapper had engaged in some other unusual behavior in the days leading up to the naked walk through Los Angeles, including changing his name on Instagram to “Queen Madeline” and posting content of himself in various costumes.


	Lil Nas' father told news outlets that his son was experiencing mental instability during the incident. Police officers initially hospitalized the rapper for a possible drug overdose, but his attorneys have since stated that they do not yet know whether drugs were involved.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	For a second year in a row, it came down to the final Emmy category of the night, and in both cases, HBO Max walked away with a surprising big win. Last year it was Outstanding Comedy series for Hacks, and this year it was Outstanding Drama Series for The Pitt, which went head-to-head with the most nominated program of 2025, Apple TV+'s Severance. 


	“It was obviously a huge night for The Pitt,” Casey Bloys, Chairman and CEO, HBO and HBO Max Content, told Deadline at the streamer's post-Emmy party Sunday night at San Vicente Bungalows.


HBO Max tied Netflix for most Emmy wins this year with 30, including five for medical dram The Pitt, from ER alums John Wells, R. Scott Gemmill and Noah Wyle: Drama Series, Lead Actor in a Drama Series for Wyle, Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for Katherine LaNasa, Guest Actor in a Drama Series for Shawn Hatosy, and Casting for a Drama Series.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	 “For John and Scott, to do a show starting out with 15 episodes — and remember, we're coming back in January, that's not what a lot of Emmy winners are doing right now,” Bloys said of The Pitt, which is being produced under a broadcast-type model — a modest budget, larger seasons (15 episodes each, double the average for a streaming drama) and a quick turnaround that delivers a new season every 12 months. 


	Season 2 of The Pitt is slated to premiere in January 2026, exactly a year after Season 1 debuted in January 2025. 


	“To come out first season, not only to get nominated and to have Katherine and Noah win, but for the show to win, that's a huge deal, so I'm proud of them,” Bloys continued. “It was a very exciting night, we didn't know which way it was going to go.” 


	He confirmed that there are “a couple shows that we are developing” under the same model as The Pitt, with announcements expected soon.


	One of the most unexpected Emmy winners Sunday was Somebody Somewhere‘s Jeff Hiller for his role on the underrated HBO comedy. And Hannah Einbinder earned her first Emmy after four seasons of Hacks alongside lead Jean Start who nabbed her fourth. 

	











	“I was very pleasantly surprised to see Jeff recognized and the show. It is a beautiful show about friendship, and I was just so thrilled for it to be recognized tonight,” Bloys said. “I was also very pleased that Hannah was recognized.”


	On the flip side, Colin Farrell didn't win for The Penguin as some predicted, and The White Lotus was shut out in the Supporting Actor/Actress categories despite six nominations across the two fields. (Farrell's co-lead, Cristin Milioti, did win her category.)


RELATED: Emmys Snubs & Surprises: ‘The Pitt', Britt Lower, Jeff Hiller Win, ‘White Lotus' Shut Out


	“I was surprised that Colin — he's a great guy, I was a little surprised. But that's awards shows, it's unpredictable,” Bloys said. “I do think that The White Lotus may have been a victim of his own success with so many nominations in the categories. But again, that's the way it goes.”


	Deadline's impromptu interview with Bloys was crashed by Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, who jumped in to praise the veteran HBO executive.


	“Casey Bloys, the man, he's killing it. HBO has never been this strong,” he said. 


	Since Bloys took over HBO in 2016, the network has managed to win at least one of the top scripted categories, Drama, Comedy and Limited Series, every year except 2021, which was impacted by the pandemic.


	“I just celebrated my 21st year at HBO. So I've been here 21 years, and I will say every year I have been at HBO, there have been stories about, is it the end of HBO? So can we please, after 21 years, put that to rest?,” Bloys asked. “I just want to celebrate what the team has done across the board, specials, documentaries, drama, comedy, everything. I'm really proud of what everybody has done tonight.”


	In addition to the Drama Series Emmy award for The Pitt and another Scripted Variety Series Emmy for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, HBO this year also won Best Documentary or Nonfiction Series for 100 Foot Wave and Documentary or Nonfiction Special for Pee-wee As Himself.


	“That's the thing that HBO has consistently done, it's usually not one show that wins everything,” Bloys said, taking a subtle dig at Apple TV+ and Netflix, which swept the comedy and limited series Sunday night with The Studio and Adolescence, respectively, as their main Emmy tally drivers. “We are consistent across the board; all the different teams are usually putting up shows that are high quality, and they do it consistently.”


	Deadline reported earlier this month that The White Lotus will be going to France for its upcoming fourth season. Is France the destination for sure?


	“France for sure but details and location TBD,” Bloys said.


The White Lotus creator/executive producer Mike White was noticeably missing from the Emmy ceremony Sunday despite being nominated. Word is that he is France, writing the new season. Is that the case?


	“I believe that is the case,” Casey said.


	Deadline reported last month that Oscar winner Nicolas Cage is in talks to headline the upcoming fifth season of HBO‘s Emmy-winning crime anthology series True Detective, playing a detective in the new installment, which will be set in New York, in Jamaica Bay. Is he now set?


	“I can't comment on that but I'm a fan of Nic Cage,” Bloys said diplomatically.

	











House of the Dragon is looking at an early summer 2026 return, possibly in June. “I think it'll be just outside of [the 2026 Emmy eligibility window],” Bloys said. The window closes May 31, 2026.


	Fellow Game of Thrones prequel A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, originally slated to debut in 2025, will premiere in January.


	Also targeted for a January 2026 launch is Season 4 of Industry. 


	“I would love to see that show and those performers break through,” Bloys said of the financial drama, which is yet to get major awards recognition in the U.S. The most recent third season of Industry won a Best Leading Actress BAFTA TV Award for star Marisa Abela.


Euphoria‘s third season is targeting a spring release and will fit into the 2026 Emmy eligibility window. 


	In July, HBO Max handed the long-awaited series green light to Stuart Fails To Save The Universe. When will The Big Bang Theory spinoff hit the streamer?


	“I don't know that we've given you time period, but how about I say in 2026,” Bloys said. “I'm very excited, it's really funny.


	As for Harry Potter, the high-profile fantasy series will not arrive until 2027. 


	There was some confusion Sunday over the upcoming fifth season of Hacks. Einbinder said on the red carpet that Season 5 will be the Emmy-winning comedy's last, but then she tempered those comments after winning her Emmy by saying the decision was ultimately lies with series creators Jen Statsky, Lucia Aniello and Paul W. Downs.


	The trio had spoken about their original five-season plan for the show plan  signaled after Season 4 that the remaining story may need a little longer.


	“As usual, we leave that up to the creators, so they will tell us,” Bloys said about the endgame decision on Hacks.


	He indicated that the HBO Max team has not yet heard on that from Statsky, Aniello and Downs.


	“They're thinking about it, and they're going to let us know,” he said.


	As for Euphoria, whose long-delayed third season has been rumored to be its final chapter, Bloys said, “We always leave it up to producers, you never know.”


	That said, he was realistic about the odds of continuing a show that stars Zendaya, Sydney Sweeney and Jacob Elordi, with Colman Domingo also part of the cast.


	“I've never had a show with that many legitimate movie stars,” Bloys said. “So as you can imagine, the scheduling is hard enough with actors having multiple jobs, but these are probably three or four of the biggest movie stars working of their generation, so we'll see. But I'm excited to have the third season coming.


	Nathan Fielder's unique docu-comedy The Rehearsal hit its stride in Season 2 with four Emmy nominations, including for writing and directing.


	Five months after the second season ended its run on HBO, there has been no word on a third.


	“Nathan, obviously, takes a lot of time to think about,” Bloys said of Fielder. “He's got an idea, I believe. He's thinking about something, he's turning something over his head, so when he's ready to do it, we'll do it because I think he is a comic genius.”


	For reference, the gap between Seasons 1 and 2 was almost three years. 


	Three and a half months into the 2026 Emmy eligibility window, HBO Max has already launched two potential contenders: Season 3 of The Gilded Age and limited series Task from Mare of Easttown creator Brad Ingelsby and headlined by Mark Ruffalo.

	











	The 2026 race may have just been reshaped by the 2025 Emmys.


	“I go into next year with the drama frontrunner, because The Pitt is back in January,” Bloys said. “And we'll have The Gilded Age, hopefully Task breaks through, because I think the performances are phenomenal, and Hacks will be coming back. We've got a new Bill Lawrence and Steve Carell show. We've got a really great limited series called DTF with Jason Bateman and David Harbour by Steve Conrad, Euphoria is coming back. Nancy [Abraham] and Lisa [Heller] have always got an amazing docs, so I think we'll have another good year.”

Senior Managing Editor


Saturday Night Live has undergone a fairly large cast shakeup ahead of its 51st season, with five departing and five new cast members joining. Creator and executive producer Lorne Michaels broke his silence about the changes Sunday night on the Emmys red carpet.


	“The show has always brought people in from different ages and different generations and it's how it revives itself,” Michaels told Entertainment Tonight. “It's always hard when people leave but there's a time for that and our audiences always stayed relatively young and more so now with Tik Tok, and change is good. And the people we're bringing in I'm really excited about.”

Too many cast.  

Nobody at NBC has the nerve to tell him it's time to go.

He just doesn't realize it is time to turn over the keys.

If change is good, can you PLEASE retire already!

So the guy who's been doing the same job for over 45 years says change is good… Ok.

Change is good for SNL…except for you, Lorne…right.

Lol came here to say the same thing

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The Boys & Girls Clubs Of America would like to thank the Emmys","https://www.avclub.com/emmys-boys-and-girls-clubs-donation","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 15:47:00 GMT","

At the Emmys last night, host Nate Bargatze opened the show with a plan to donate $100,000 to the Boys & Girls Clubs Of America, provided that the winners' speeches didn't go past their allotted 45 seconds. For every second they went beyond 45, Bargatze promised to take $1,000 from the charity. This bit lasted the whole evening, with a decreasing ticker popping up on the screen during some of the show's more poignant moments, like when Dan Gilroy accepted his award for writing Andor, or when The Studio producer Frida Perez became the first Latina to win the award for Best Comedy. Of course, Bargatze and CBS ended up donating the money (and then some) anyway, making the intrusions ultimately unnecessary.

While some Emmy winners were probably less-than-thrilled by the bit, the charity is pretty happy about the attention. “Our heartfelt thanks to Nate Bargatze, CBS, and the Emmy Awards team for supporting Boys & Girls Clubs in such a big way,” Jim Clark, president and CEO of the organization, said in a statement, per E! News. “It was a true honor for our Club Kids to share the stage with the night's winners, especially knowing some of our alumni have gone on to become Emmy winners themselves.”

In the end, the challenge didn't end up actually raising any money for the Boys & Girls Clubs; when the ceremony ended, the total purportedly raised by the bit was sitting around -$60,000, meaning that the thank you speeches ran about 160 seconds longer than planned over the course of a three-hour telecast. But the charity did leave the ceremony with $350,000 anyway—$100,000 donated by CBS and $250,000 from Bargatze himself. Clark continued, “The generous $350,000 donation from CBS and Nate is a powerful investment in the dreams and great futures of millions of young people nationwide.”

Spoiler Space offers thoughts on, and a place to discuss, the plot points we can't disclose in our official review. Fair warning: This article features plot details of The Long Walk.

From the very first novel Stephen King published under the name Richard Bachman—the 1977 school-shooting novel Rage—his pseudonymous work has been even bleaker than what's normally associated with the horror master. The stories collected in The Bachman Books are downbeat and bloody. The heroes almost always die at the end, usually in a self-inflicted act of violence or terrorism. They thrum with an angry, youthful nihilism so potent and potentially seductive that King let Rage fall out of print after it was associated with a number of high school gunmen. All things considered, The Long Walk might have one of the sunnier endings in the Bachman oeuvre, since there's at least a chance that the protagonist is alive on the final page. Even after countless young men died on the road to glory and the lone survivor has lost his marbles, there remained something like relief beckoning the exhausted Long Walk‘s winner. But the feel-bad ending of director Francis Lawrence and writer JT Mollner's adaptation lacks even that small consolation—and it hides its even sadder finale under the guise of satisfaction.

Around the third act of the film, we learn that Ray Garraty (Cooper Hoffman), as friendly and good-hearted as he is throughout the walk, was motivated to enter and to win by the dream of violent revenge. His quest is not one of financial greed or mere survival. He wants to use the wish he gets for winning to snag a carbine and shoot The Major (Mark Hamill) in the head, just like so many of his peers on this walk (and his dissident father) were executed. 

It's a childish eye-for-an-eye fantasy, one that his level-headed—almost saintly—pal Pete McVries (David Jonsson) questions from the get-go. What will this solve? Will cutting off the head of the snake really change anything about the Walk, or will it just be a cheap hit of dopamine? These questions haunt Mollner's new ending, which makes good on The Long Walk‘s film-long investment in Pete as an enlightened guy worth corrupting.

In the novel, like in the film, the final three Walkers are Ray, Pete, and Stebbins (Garrett Wareing), The Major's bastard son. But because Stebbins is a bigger character in the book, not to mention a bigger threat, he's the one that persists alongside Ray at the end. Pete, tired of walking and tired of being saved by Ray—something the film reverses, having Pete always saving Ray—chooses to simply sit down and die. As Ray mourns his friend, he spies a shadow on the road in front of him; when he turns to tell Stebbins, Stebbins keels over, leaving Ray the winner. King never makes Ray's desires explicit in the book, and his ending capitalizes on that ambiguity: Ray never even seems to grasp that he's won, simply pursuing the dark force ahead.

Either he's lost his mind and can only see life through the lens of this contest, haunted by visions of infinite competitors one step ahead of him, or he's so close to dying that he can literally see the Reaper who's come to take him away. It's a narrative move that emphasizes the all-encompassing nature of the death march—a literalized nihilism, a specter of military PTSD or endless economic competition keeping him on the dystopian hamster wheel. Ray, in the story's final moments, even begins to run towards his fate.

And that's one of Bachman's lighter endings! But Lawrence and Mollner, in part, I imagine, to keep the ending as grounded as the rest of their bloody adaptation, nix the Ghost Of Long Walks Future. They also change the winner. The Long Walk spends its runtime not just establishing a straightforward genre premise or building the bromance between two young men caught in its meat grinder, but establishing Pete's moral fiber and idealism, born of past mistakes. And, knowing how pessimistic The Long Walk is, a character this pure must only exist to fall back down to grubby earth.

In the film, Stebbins kicks the bucket a little earlier, and then it's Ray who quits early. He sacrifices himself for his friend, knowing that Pete has the big heart and silver-lining perspective needed to actually do some good with the power bestowed upon the Walk's winner. Or at least, he did before The Long Walk broke him. After Pete enacts Ray's plan, wishing for the carbine of the soldier right next to him, then blowing away The Major in an act of impotent political violence, his lurch off into the night has no hope, no glimmer of possibility that by snuffing the loudmouth at the top, anything has changed aside from tarnishing his own morality.

Lawrence refuses to show any of the aftermath of The Major's death, any chaos from spectators or soldiers, because he doesn't need to. By following through on this juvenile daydream, this delusion that killing one man can stop interlocking systems of oppression, Pete has compromised himself. Even if he keeps walking forward, he hasn't really changed anything. The future is just as uncertain as in the book, but with the added certainty that corruption awaits even the best of us as long as we're stuck in societies like this. That some in the audience—probably some younger guys who look a lot like those on the Walk—will inevitably cheer The Major's death is just another facet of the ending's broad tragedy.

The most frustrating part of this year's Primetime Emmy Awards was the wasted potential. Multiple records were broken, there were many history-making wins, plus upsets galore, and yet all anyone is talking about is a bit that wore out its welcome the second the Boys & Girls Club charity pot went from six figures to five.

Walking into the lobby of the Peacock Theater on a particularly muggy Sunday afternoon, there was actually a lot of enthusiasm for comedian Nate Bargatze's first stint as host. Not only was he already an Emmy nominee this year for his most recent Netflix comedy special “Your Friend, Nate Bargatze,” but he had also been one of the hosts during the landmark 50th season of “Saturday Night Live.”

His opening sketch, a play on “SNL” highlight “Washington's Dream,” co-starring cast members Bowen Yang, James Austin Johnson, and Mikey Day, worked super-well in the room, with jokes like “What is streaming, sir?” “A new way for people to lose money,” eliciting laughs from the audience full of Television Academy members who work in the industry.

Maybe chalk that up to beginner's luck, or playing the hits, but forgoing a traditional monologue to announce an ongoing bit about taking money away from charity in the name of shorter speeches was dead on arrival. And following it shortly with actress Jennifer Coolidge taking triple the amount of time anyone took to give a speech just to present the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series to “Hacks” star Jean Smart didn't help.

Immediately, it was clear that Bargatze and Emmys producers Jesse Collins, Dionne Harmon, and Jeannae Rouzan-Clay did not realize the extent to which they were prioritizing a bunch of presenter bits that did not work (as often is the case) over the main thing fans of awards shows generally tune in for: heartfelt acceptance speeches.

Thankfully, the charity pot countdown did not seem to get in the way of speeches from actors who gave breakthrough performances this season, like “The Pitt” star Katherine LaNasa and “Severance” star Tramell Tillman, the latter of whom became the first ever Black winner for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series.

But even when there weren't those imposing numbers on the board, Bargatze's only commentary on those emotional TV moments was always just some play on how the winner damaged the charity pot.

 










It was emblematic of a problem with awards shows in general, one that Bargatze and company are just another example of: These are live events, and live events feed off of the energy in the crowds. 

If you lose the crowd, you lose the show. The past two Golden Globes also suffered from this, as part of the reason comedian Jo Koy tanked was that no one in the Beverly Hilton ballroom could actually hear him. The next year, they made sure host Nikki Glaser's mic was on, yet none of the presenter bits worked because the staging had them perform jokes to the camera, with their backs to the majority of the audience in the room.

If “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” winning its first Emmy for Outstanding Talk Series on the precipice of the show coming to an end continues to be seen as the highlight of the telecast, it is because the audience inside the Peacock Theater was clapping and cheering for host Colbert before they even read off the nominees. That win? It was the most hype the crowd ever got.

Despite the production's shortcomings, at least there was an overall sense of contentment with the actual awards results, especially given the amount of surprise wins. (For instance, virtually everyone was happy to see “Somebody Somewhere” star Jeff Hiller unexpectedly triumph in the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series over big stars like Harrison Ford and Colman Domingo and perennial nominees like Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Bowen Yang.)

 










The after-parties were all jubilant, and refreshingly free of the kind of bad, distracting bits that so hurt the show itself. As one awards specialist sagely put it, “We all love a surprise, you just hope it goes in your favor.” On the telecast, it didn't.

Drive-By Truckers are reissuing another album. A new edition of 2003's Decoration Day is out November 14 via New West. The Definitive Decoration Day includes a remixed and remastered version of the original album and a bunch of songs recorded live at Flicker Bar, in Athens, Georgia, in 2002. Below, listen to two versions of “Sink Hole,” the remixed and remastered track and a recording from Flicker Bar.

The Definitive Decoration Day is being released digitally and in a 4xLP box set. David Barbe, who produced the original album, did the new remix, and Greg Calbi remastered it. The physical collection includes a 40-page, full-color book with photographs, artwork, and a new essay by longtime Pitchfork contributor Stephen M. Deusner.

In a press release, Patterson Hood discussed the band's Flicker Bar show that's now captured on The Definitive Decoration Day. “We decided that it would be fun to go play an acoustic late-night show at the tiny Flicker Bar, less than a block away from our beloved 40 Watt Club,” he said. “We ended up playing a set that included all but one song off of our new, but still unfinished album. I didn't even know until recently that there was an existing tape of the show. This is a beautiful document of our band at a very crucial and joyous moment in time. I'm so happy that it exists.”

Decoration Day was the follow-up to Drive-By Truckers' acclaimed third album, Southern Rock Opera, and it was the band's first with Jason Isbell. “The legacy of the band has definitely grown,” Isbell reflected in a statement, “and there's a new appreciation for the Truckers and especially for that era of Decoration Day. Without them, you wouldn't have the kind of work being done by MJ Lenderman and Wednesday and Waxahatchee and a bunch of other acts. I can hear the Truckers in all that music.”

In 2023, Drive-By Truckers reissued 2004's The Dirty South as The Complete Dirty South. Then, last year, they shared a new deluxe edition of Southern Rock Opera.

	Grammy-winning artist Lil Nas X, born Montero Hill, is “in treatment” at an undisclosed facility in another state following his arrest and arraignment on felony charges last month, his lawyers confirmed at a court hearing Monday.


	“Defendant is allowed to remain out of state as long as he remains in treatment,” Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Shellie Samuels said as she modified the conditions of Hill's release to allow for the ongoing inpatient care. If Hill's “treatment changes, and he becomes outpatient, then we'll talk,” she said, setting the next hearing in the case for November. The judge sealed the details of the type of care Hill is seeking.


	“You heard the ‘treatment' word. We're doing what is best for Montero from a personal standpoint and a professional standpoint, but most importantly, for his well-being,” Hill's lawyer, Drew Findling, said after the hearing. “He is surrounded by an amazing family, an amazing team of people that care about him and love him. And we're just addressing those issues. It's really as simple as that. He's had a great life, and he'll continue to have a great life. This is a bump that he's going to get over.”

	











	In August, Hill was charged with three felony counts of battery with injury on a police officer and one felony count of resisting an executive officer. Prosecutors claim Hill was “strolling naked” along Ventura Boulevard around 5:40 a.m. on Aug. 21 when police arrived at the scene. They allege Hill assaulted the responding officers trying to take him into custody, injuring at least three of them. If convicted as charged, Hill faces up to five years in state prison.

	Hill pleaded not guilty at an arraignment Aug. 25 and was released on a $75,000 bond after spending the weekend in jail. He later addressed the arrest in a social media post, assuring fans he was safe. “Your girl is gonna be OK, y'all,” Hill said in an Instagram Story post. “OK? She's gonna be all right. Shit.” Letting out a weary laugh, he said, “That was fucking terrifying. That was terrifying. That was a terrifying last four days. But your girl is gonna be all right.”

	Bystander video of Hill roaming along the main thoroughfare in Studio City was posted on TMZ. It showed Hill wearing underwear and a pair of cowboy boots as he walked in the street. In one clip, he was seen with an orange traffic cone on his head.


	Before the arrest, Hill shared some unreleased music and mirror selfies in Instagram posts that sparked concern. Los Angeles Police initially transported Hill to a nearby hospital for a possible overdose. He spent several hours there before being taken to jail.

	Hill's father, Robert Stafford, raced to Los Angeles to support the “Old Town Road” rapper and later told London's The Times that Hill had been dealing with “pressure” that he placed on himself as an artist and the “breadwinner” for multiple people.


	“We all have breakdowns every now and then, but the difference is, yours get played out in the public eye,” when you're a celebrity, Stafford told the outlet. “Hopefully, this is a turning point in his mental stability.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Unsolved+Mysteries","The Biggest Mysteries In The Zelda Universe That Still Haven't Been Solved","https://www.thegamer.com/zelda-universe-biggest-mysteries-still-not-solved/","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 19:15:00 GMT","

The Legend of Zelda series has never been known for coherent lore. Heck, one look at the timeline (if you can even call it one) and you'll see that the developers don't exactly have lore and narrative at the forefront of their minds when making these games.

Having said that, it's still fun to dive into the story of the Zelda games and piece together what we do have. In doing that, the fan community has come across a lot of mysteries that are yet to be solved in any game. These are the biggest of those mysteries, and my best guess at what the answers to them might be.

Majora's Mask has so many mysteries, I could easily write an entire article covering its mysteries alone. Its most obvious mystery, however, is the titular Majora's Mask itself. Did Majora make the mask? What is the mask based on? 

Beyond the mask itself, you have to wonder how the Happy Mask Salesman got his hands on it. He clearly knows that it's dangerous, and he certainly acts… odd when discussing it. I'd put my money on the fact that he had some hand in it all, personally. He doesn't seem innocent to me.

In classic Zelda fashion, Tears of the Kingdom didn't answer all our questions from Breath of the Wild. Instead, it gave us many, many more questions. Top of the list for me has to be the identity of Rauru and Sonia's child. 

For the Hyrule Royal Family line to continue after Rauru and Sonia are killed, they must have had a child offscreen. Who is this child? What do they look like? Why are they never with their parents? I'm mostly curious because I want to know what a Zonai and Hylian hybrid would look like. Is it cursed or cute? Nintendo probably just didn't want to delve into that and decided to leave it to our imaginations. Maybe Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment will tell us, but I don't have high hopes.

Ocarina of Time has a largely straightforward story as far as Zelda games go. The only real question by the end of it all is, where is Navi off to? Once Link returns to his childhood, Navi flies off. Link goes to look for her, which leads him into the Lost Woods and the events of Majora's Mask.

Metaphorically, Navi flying away symbolises Link being a grown-up and not a fairy child anymore. But why didn't she say goodbye? Is she off on another adventure now, with some other child who needs her? We'll never know.

One of the big twists revealed in Skyward Sword is that Ghirahim is to Demise what Fi is to Link: a companion residing in a powerful sword. The Master Sword is an important part of Zelda lore and features in almost every game since its debut, so where is Demise's sword?

Ganondorf doesn't really have a signature weapon like Link does, so we could assume it's the same sword, but this has never been confirmed.

Twilight Princess is confirmed to be a sequel to Ocarina of Time, with Ganondorf in both games being the very same man, and Twilight Princess Link being a descendant of the Hero of Time. However, despite this connection, one aspect of Hyrule is very different: the Hyrule in Twilight Princess has no Gerudo.

Instead of Gerudo Valley, in its place is Arbiter's Grounds. Where did all the Gerudo go after the events of Ocarina of Time? Were they ashamed of their connection to Ganondorf, and fled the lands to escape their shame? Twilight Princess doesn't tell us anything, so we'll just have to make up our own interpretation of events.

At the end of Link's Awakening, it's revealed that Koholint Island, and everyone on it, was part of the Wind Fish's dream. However, since Link was there and he's real, was anyone else? Marin also ‘becomes' real by turning into a seagull, which was her wish.

Was she always real (just not in the form of a girl), or was her wish so strong that she became real anyway? We never see Marin again, so we'll never find out if she was a dream-turned-real, or if she was real all along. I'd like to think she was a dream who became real, personally. It's a lot more whimsical that way.

Remember when I said Majora's Mask could have a whole article of its mysteries on its own? Well, we have another whopper from Majora's Mask. If you collect every single mask in the game, you can trade them in and get the Fierce Deity Mask, which transforms Link into an adult and gives him the Fierce Deity Sword.

Aside from it being extremely powerful, we have next to no information about what the Fierce Deity actually is. Is it from Termina? Is it from the same place as Majora's Mask? Does the Fierce Deity actually look like that, or is it just adapting to Link's form? So many questions, and literally zero answers. Thanks, Nintendo.

Breath of the Wild is full of creatures, big and small. At every stable, and in lots of towns, you can find adorable dogs. You can even feed them food! But, I hear you asking, what about cats? 

Apparently, Calamity Ganon wiped out every single cat that ever lived in Hyrule. There's not a single one in the entire game, and they don't come back in Tears of the Kingdom either. Seriously, why is this world completely devoid of cats? Twilight Princess had it right and had an abundance of cats. Link could even pick them up to snuggle with them. Breath of the Wild has no such joys. I don't care about where the dragons came from or where BotW is on the timeline - I want to know where all the cats have gone!

Teck Resources's Highland Valley Copper Mine near Logan Lake, B.C. The company announced mining deal with Anglo American last week, and Prime Minister Mark Carney said London-based Anglo would need to move its headquarters to Canada to get the necessary government approval.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press

Prime Minister Mark Carney told Anglo American PLC NGLOY that it had to move its headquarters to Canada or its proposed acquisition of Teck Resources Ltd. TECK-B-T would not be allowed to proceed, two sources familiar with the matter told The Globe and Mail. 

London-based Anglo last week unveiled an all-stock takeover of Vancouver-based Teck worth approximately US$20-billion. In an unusual move, Anglo said it would move its headquarters to Vancouver once the deal closed. 

Mr. Carney also made it clear in his conversations with Anglo American that the requirement to move headquarters to Canada would be a bar that any company planning on buying Teck would have to hit, the sources said.

The Globe and Mail is not identifying the sources because they were not authorized to speak publicly. 

Eric Reguly: With Anglo American at its side, Teck's mission to become a pure critical metals company takes a hit

What does the massive Anglo Teck deal mean for the future of mining in Canada? We answered your questions

Audrey Champoux, a spokesperson for Mr. Carney, declined to comment. 

James Wyatt-Tilby, senior vice-president, corporate affairs with Anglo, declined to comment. 

Teck declined to comment on Carney's conditions for the Anglo deal, but Doug Brown, Teck's vice-president of communications and government affairs, wrote in an email to The Globe that “it is unprecedented for a major multi-national mining company to move its global headquarters to Canada in this fashion.“ 

With Mr. Carney insisting that any potential suitor for Teck move its headquarters to Canada, the chances of other bidders surfacing appears to be low. Other previously speculated suitors for Teck, including BHP Group Inc., Glencore PLC, Vale SA, and Freeport-McMoRan Inc., all which have headquarters outside of Canada. 

Analysis: Teck Resources justified its takeover to shareholders – but not to Canadians

Ottawa in 2024 tightened the rules around proposed acquisitions of Canadian critical minerals companies. After approving Glencore PLC's acquisition of a majority stake in Teck's coal business, then-industry minister François-Philippe Champagne said Canada would only approve foreign acquisitions of important Canadian mining companies engaged in significant critical-minerals operations “in the most exceptional of circumstances.”

In justifying the higher bar, he said it was because of the strategic importance of Canada's critical-minerals sector and the need to protect it.

The proposed takeover of Teck by Anglo must still be approved by Ottawa before it can close. Industry Minister Mélanie Joly will scrutinize the transaction for national-security concerns, and it must make economic sense for Canada under the net-benefit test.

Anglo also said that its chief executive officer, deputy CEO, chief financial officer and “a significant majority” of the executive management team will be based in and live in Canada; and “a substantial proportion” of the board of directors will be Canadian. In addition, the company will be renamed “Anglo Teck.”

While Anglo has promised to move its headquarters to Canada, it will remain a British company domiciled in London. In addition, the company's primary stock listing will be in London. A secondary stock listing is planned for Canada.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Price predictions 9/15: SPX, DXY, BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, BNB, DOGE, ADA, HYPE","https://cointelegraph.com/news/price-predictions-9-15-spx-dxy-btc-eth-xrp-sol-bnb-doge-ada-hype","Mon, 15 Sep 2025 18:25:52 GMT","

 Bitcoin is facing solid resistance at $117,500, but the possibility of a rally to $124,474 remains high as long as the price remains above the moving averages. 

Key points:

Bitcoin is facing significant resistance at $117,500, but the bulls remain on top as long as the price stays above $113,400.

Several altcoins are showing signs of profit booking in the near term, but lower levels are likely to attract buyers.

Bitcoin's (BTC) failure to cross above the $117,500 resistance on Monday attracted profit booking by short-term buyers, who have pulled the price below $115,000. Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan said in a post on X that BTC has not topped out at $124,500 because of strong institutional demand, which is growing. 

Spot BTC exchange-traded funds recorded $642.35 million in inflows on Friday, according to SoSoValue data. That propelled the weekly inflows to $2.34 billion. The inflows were not limited to BTC ETFs alone. Ether (ETH) ETFs garnered $637.68 million in inflows last week.

However, not everyone is buying BTC in this market. Lookonchain said in a post on X that a long-term BTC whale, who swapped $4 billion in BTC for ETH two weeks ago, has sent 1,176 BTC worth over $136 million into the trading platform Hyperliquid (HYPE) on Sunday, and has started dumping.

Could BTC overcome its overhead resistance? Will select altcoins start a new up move? Let's analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. 

The S&P 500 Index (SPX) continued its northward march higher, signaling that the bulls are firmly in the driver's seat.

Buyers will try to extend the uptrend to 6,700, where the bears are expected to pose a substantial challenge. If the bulls do not allow the price to dip below the 20-day exponential moving average (6,491), the up move may reach the 7,000 level.

The bears will have to sink the index below the 50-day simple moving average (6,391) to gain strength. The index may then tumble to the breakout level of 6,147, which is likely to attract buyers.

The bears repeatedly thwarted attempts by the bulls to push the US Dollar Index (DXY) above the moving averages.

Sellers will try to strengthen their position by pulling the price below the 97.10 support. If they do that, the next stop could be the solid support at 96.37. Buyers are expected to defend the 96.37 level with all their might because a break below it may sink the index to the 95 level.

The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the moving averages. That suggests the selling pressure may be reducing. The index could then rally to 99 and, after that, to 100.50.

BTC has been trading above the 20-day EMA ($113,365), but the bulls are struggling to push the price above the $117,500 resistance.

The bears will try to yank the price below the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, it suggests that the BTC/USDT pair may extend its stay inside the $107,000 to $124,474 range for a few more days.

Alternatively, if buyers push the price above $117,500, the pair could reach the $124,474 level. Sellers are expected to vigorously defend the level, but if the buyers bulldoze their way through, the next leg of the uptrend could reach $141,948.

ETH turned down from the $4,788 to $4,956 resistance zone, indicating that the bears are active at higher levels.

The ETH/USDT pair has reached the 20-day EMA ($4,438), which is a critical level to watch out for. If the price bounces off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to push the pair above the overhead zone. If they can pull it off, the Ether price could start the next leg of the uptrend toward $5,500.

Contrarily, if the price skids below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are losing their grip. The bears will then try to sink the price to the critical support at $4,060.

XRP (XRP) turned down from $3.18 on Saturday and is retesting the breakout level from the descending triangle pattern.

If the price turns up from the downtrend line, it signals that the bulls are trying to flip the level into support. Buyers will then try to resume the up move by pushing the XRP/USDT pair above $3.20. If they do that, the XRP price could rally to $3.40 and subsequently to $3.66.

Alternatively, if the price breaks below the downtrend line, it suggests that the breakout above the triangle may have been a bull trap. The pair could then plummet to the solid support at $2.69.

Solana (SOL) turned down from $250 on Sunday, indicating that the bears are selling as the price nears the $260 overhead resistance.

The SOL/USDT pair could dip to the 20-day EMA ($217), which is likely to attract buyers. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it signals demand at lower levels. The bulls will then strive to push the Solana price above $260, targeting the all-time high at $295.

Instead, if the price continues lower and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits in a hurry. The Solana price could then drop to the 50-day SMA ($195).

BNB (BNB) has been in a strong uptrend for the past few days, indicating sustained demand from the bulls.

Both moving averages are sloping up, and the RSI is in the positive territory, signaling that buyers are in control. The bulls will try to push the price to $1,000, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense.

The first support on the downside is at the 20-day EMA ($884). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with force, it signals that the uptrend remains intact. The bulls will then try to propel the BNB price to $1,100. A short-term top will be signaled if the BNB/USDT pair turns down and plummets below the 50-day SMA ($841).

Dogecoin (DOGE) pierced the $0.29 resistance on Saturday, but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels.

The bears are trying to pull the price to the 20-day EMA ($0.24), which is a vital level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with force, it shows demand at lower levels. The bulls will try to propel the DOGE/USDT pair above $0.31. If they succeed, the Dogecoin price may rise to $0.35 and then to $0.44.

Sellers will have to tug the price below the 20-day EMA to weaken the bullish momentum. The pair may then slide to the 50-day SMA ($0.22).

Cardano (ADA) has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision about the next directional move.

The bulls will have to drive the Cardano price above the resistance line to gain the upper hand. If they can pull it off, the ADA/USDT pair could surge to $1.02. Sellers will try to halt the up move at $1.02, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could soar to $1.17 and then to $1.25.

This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the support line. The pair could then plunge to $0.78 and eventually to $0.68.

HYPE pulled back after hitting $57.44 on Friday, but the shallow correction suggests the bulls are not rushing to the exit.

The upsloping 20-day EMA ($50.11) and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that buyers remain in command. The bulls will try to resume the uptrend by pushing the Hyperliquid price above $57.44. If they manage to do that, the HYPE/USDT pair could rally toward the pattern target of $64.25.

The first support on the downside is at $49.88 and then at the 50-day SMA (45.28). A close below the 50-day SMA signals a short-term top is in place.

 September 15, 2025  

SCOTTSDALE, AZ — In patients with Graves disease, prescribing a lower maintenance dose of methimazole (MMI) before discontinuing the drug is associated with significantly higher rates of remission, compared with a higher dose, according to a new study presented at the 2025 American Thyroid Association Annual Meeting.

“If further research confirms this association, these findings could contribute to revisions in clinical guidelines and encourage the broader adoption of tailored tapering strategies in clinical practice,” the researchers wrote in the study, which was published online in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism. “These strategies could substantially reduce the number of relapsed cases, considering the global prevalence of Graves' disease.”

Relapse of Graves disease after standard antithyroid treatment with MMI and other antithyroid drugs is common, ranging from 20% up to 70%, with risk factors including the total duration of time on antithyroid medication and the length of time patients remain on a minimum dose, the authors noted.

Recent studies have indicated that a minimum maintenance dose prior to discontinuation has emerged as “a critical, modifiable factor under the control of physicians,” wrote first author Takashi Akamizu, MD, of the Center for Excellence in Thyroid Care, Kuma Hospital, Kobe, Japan, and colleagues.

In Japan, a lower dose is easier to achieve with a 2.5-mg tablet formulation that was made available there in February 2021. The current lowest dose available in tablet form in the United States is 5 mg.

Because evidence regarding the optimal maintenance dose before discontinuation was lacking, the researchers conducted a retrospective cohort study to determine whether a lower dose than 2.5 mg would reduce relapse rates.

The researchers identified 4352 patients at Kuma Hospital who were newly diagnosed with Graves disease between 2008 and 2024 and who had discontinued MMI after receiving a minimal maintenance dose of 2.5 mg per day or less.

The patients were categorized into four groups according to their final maintenance dose prior to discontinuing MMI: 2.5 mg/day (n = 3523); > 1.25 to < 2.5 mg/day (n = 526); 1.25 mg/day (n = 227); and < 1.25 mg/day (n = 76). Those who had doses below 2.5 mg received the pill every other day.

The rates of relapse at 1 year in the four groups were 13.8% for a maintenance dose of 2.5 mg/day; 13.1% with > 1.25 to < 2.5 mg/day; 7.1% with 1.25 mg/day; and 2.6% in the < 1.25 mg group.

Of note, 85.5% of those in the 1.25 mg/day group had thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) titers below the detection limit at baseline, compared with approximately 55% in the < 1.25 and > 1.25 to < 2.5 mg/day groups and 45.8% in the 2.5 mg/day group.

After adjusting for factors — including age, sex, thyroid volume, smoking status, total duration of MMI treatment, duration of maintenance dose, and TRAb titer at the time of discontinuation — the associations were unchanged.

Compared with those tapered at 2.5 mg/day, the adjusted risk ratios (RRs) for relapse were 0.92 for the > 1.25 to < 2.5 mg/day group, 0.46 for the 1.25 mg/day group, and 0.18 for the < 1.25 mg/day group.

“A statistically significant trend was observed across dose categories (P for trend <.05), suggesting a dose-response relationship where lower MMI doses prior to discontinuation were associated with a reduced risk of relapse,” the authors reported.

In a propensity score analysis in which patients were matched into two groups of 172 patients with similar characteristics, those receiving 1.25 mg/day of MMI had a significantly lower 1-year relapse risk compared with those receiving 2.5 mg/day (RR, 0.44).

In propensity score comparisons of patients receiving ≤ 1.25 mg/day vs those receiving > 1.25 to ≤ 2.5 mg/day of MMI prior to discontinuation (with 271 patients in each group), the 1-year risk of relapse was significantly lower in the ≤ 1.25 mg/day group compared with the > 1.25 to ≤ 2.5 mg/day group (RR, 0.46).

The findings underscore that “a lower minimal MMI dose before discontinuation is associated with lower relapse,” Akamizu told Medscape Medical News. 

“A less than 2.5 mg per day tapering strategy may be useful, [and] the final MMI dose should be considered before discontinuation,” he said.

Previous studies have indicated that the duration of the maintenance period, and not necessarily the minimum maintenance dose itself, may be associated with the risk of relapse.

“The minimum dose has received less attention in discussions, partly because it is often determined by the available tablet strengths,” the researchers wrote.

The authors noted that treatment duration has been suggested to contribute to TRAb negativity, suggesting that the lower minimum maintenance dose prolonged the treatment period and resulted in the reduced risk of relapse.

However, the current study showed an association between the lowest dose and lower relapse risk, even after adjusting for both treatment duration and the duration of maintenance at the minimum dose.

“This suggests that the minimum dose itself, as well as the gradual tapering process, may independently reduce the risk of relapse,” the authors wrote.

The specific mechanism could involve “stabilizing the immune state or minimizing immune reactivation,” they added. “However, these remain speculative hypotheses, and further research is needed to elucidate the underlying immunological and physiological mechanisms of these observations.”

In the meantime, lower-dose tablet formulations should be considered for broader availability, the authors noted.

“Dissemination and development of lower-dose formulations, such as 2.5 mg and 1.25 mg, may be more cost-effective compared with new drug development,” Akamizu told Medscape Medical News.

While TRAb negativity can guide discontinuation, relapse rates can still vary, and — particularly in older populations — longer-duration low-dose MMI can be beneficial, James Hennessey, MD, an associate professor of medicine, at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, told Medscape Medical News.

“I've got a lot of patients, especially older patients, who have been reduced to 1.25 mg per day or 2.5 mg per day, and others might say ‘that's such a small dose, what good is it doing?' But when they discontinue, the hyperthyroidism comes back,” added Hennessey, who was not involved in the study. “So, a lot of people get by on very low doses, and it can be just enough to keep them in balance and keep their thyroid function normal.”

Akamizu said that he continues patients on the low dose, even if their TRAb levels are negative.

“Patients are generally more satisfied with the 1.25 dose, probably because they feel [they are] getting better or approaching the remission,” he added.

The study findings show that “dose reduction is feasible in daily practice,” Akamizu said.

“The take-home message from this for clinicians should be to try the lower dose of MMI if your aim is the remission of Grave' disease,” he said.

Akamizu and Hennessey had no disclosures to report related to the study.

Nearly half of U.S. adults - 122.4 million people - are living with high blood pressure (BP), a leading preventable risk factor for heart disease, stroke and premature death, according to the 2025 American Heart Association Statistical Update. Yet just a quarter of them have their BP under control, making both diagnosis and effective management critical.

The American Heart Association, a relentless force changing the future of health for everyone everywhere, and American Medical Association (AMA) are recognizing 2,307 health care organizations - 495 more than in 2024 - for tackling this public health challenge through the Target: BP™ initiative.

Target: BP™ is a national initiative launched in 2015 by the American Heart Association and AMA in response to the high prevalence of uncontrolled blood pressure. Together, the associations:

This year's participating organizations span 49 states or U.S. territories and serve more than 38 million patients, including nearly 10.6 million people with hypertension. More than 40% of participating organizations are nonprofit health centers that receive federal funding from the Health Resources and Services Administration to reach medically underserved populations.

Among those organizations recognized for their efforts, nearly 60% received Gold or Gold+ award level recognition for achieving BP control rates of greater than or equal to 70%. Approximately 37% of awardees achieved Silver or Silver+ recognition for adopting evidence-based activities. The remainder received Participation-level recognition for submitting data for the first time and committing to reducing the number of adult patients with uncontrolled BP.

Hypertension is called the 'silent killer' for a reason - too often it goes unnoticed until serious damage is done, and it accounts for nearly $50 billion in annual health care costs in the U.S.. Through programs like Target: BP, we're seeing how health care organizations and care teams can work to close gaps in blood pressure control through patient awareness and education and improve overall well-being.""

Stacey Rosen, M.D., FAHA, volunteer president of the American Heart Association and senior vice president of women's health and executive director of the Katz Institute for Women's Health of Northwell Health in New York City

Since the American Heart Association and AMA launched Target: BP™, more than 4,900 health care organizations have joined the nationwide movement to make heart health a priority. For the past five years, approximately 80% of participating organizations have continued their engagement year after year - reflecting a continuous commitment to improving BP and sharing a common goal to improve health outcomes associated with heart disease, the No. 1 killer in the U.S.

""We know hypertension control is possible when physicians, care teams and patients work together,"" said AMA President Bobby Mukkamala, M.D. ""The Target: BP program provides physicians and care teams with the tools they need to effectively partner with patients and ensure all Americans have access to quality care, to manage their blood pressure.""

Olivia Moultrie's 20th birthday is just days away on Sept. 17, but before that, the 19-year-old made history by becoming the highest-scoring teenager in NWSL history.

Moultrie tallied her 14th career goal for the Portland Thorns in a 1-1 draw to the Chicago Red Stars on Sunday. In the 12th minute, Moultrie launched a 20-yard strike off a free kick that arched above the Red Stars goalkeeper's reach.

In an interview after the goal during the broadcast, Moultrie said while she didn't realize that goal set the record, scoring off set pieces was something she had been working on with assistant coaches.

“I watched [Lionel] Messi become too good at them, so I decided I wanted to add that to my arsenal,” she said.

The Thorns midfielder tied the milestone last month, before surpassing fellow USWNT midfielder Jaedyn Shaw, who previously held the record for most NWSL goals scored by a teenager. Meanwhile, Shaw recently transferred from the North Carolina Courage — the team Moultrie tied the record against — to Gotham FC. Shaw scored in her club debut this past weekend as the 20-year-old continues the strong start to her career she had as a teenager. The future is bright for both midfielders.

The finish was Moultrie's fourth goal of the season. Her career high for a single season is seven, which she set in 2024. Moultrie made her NWSL debut when she was just 15 years old and later became the youngest player in the league to score at 16 years old in 2022. In 2023, she earned her first USWNT cap and has made nine total appearances and scored two international goals.

The goal in NWSL Matchday 20 of 26 helped keep Portland (8-6-6, 30 points) as a top four team in the league as the regular season's end draws closer. The San Diego Wave's (8-6-6, 30 points) recent win has tied the Thorns record-wise, but the Thorns top the Wave in goal differential by two.","{'href': 'https://www.ussoccer.com', 'title': 'US Soccer'}","soccer"
