                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prime Minister Mark Carney told Anglo American PLC NGLOY that it had to move its headquarters to Canada or its proposed acquisition of Teck Resources Ltd. TECK-B-T would not be allowed to proceed, two sources familiar with the matter told The Globe and Mail. London-based Anglo last week unveiled an all-stock takeover of Vancouver-based Teck worth approximately US$20-billion. Mr. Carney also made it clear in his conversations with Anglo American that the requirement to move headquarters to Canada would be a bar that any company planning on buying Teck would have to hit, the sources said. Audrey Champoux, a spokesperson for Mr. Carney, declined to comment. James Wyatt-Tilby, senior vice-president, corporate affairs with Anglo, declined to comment. With Mr. Carney insisting that any potential suitor for Teck move its headquarters to Canada, the chances of other bidders surfacing appears to be low. Other previously speculated suitors for Teck, including BHP Group Inc., Glencore PLC, Vale SA, and Freeport-McMoRan Inc., all which have headquarters outside of Canada. Ottawa in 2024 tightened the rules around proposed acquisitions of Canadian critical minerals companies. After approving Glencore PLC's acquisition of a majority stake in Teck's coal business, then-industry minister François-Philippe Champagne said Canada would only approve foreign acquisitions of important Canadian mining companies engaged in significant critical-minerals operations “in the most exceptional of circumstances.” Industry Minister Mélanie Joly will scrutinize the transaction for national-security concerns, and it must make economic sense for Canada under the net-benefit test. Anglo also said that its chief executive officer, deputy CEO, chief financial officer and “a significant majority” of the executive management team will be based in and live in Canada; and “a substantial proportion” of the board of directors will be Canadian. In addition, the company will be renamed “Anglo Teck.” Study and track financial data on any traded entity: click to open the full quote page.

After four days of backlash, Fox News anchor Brian Kilmeade has apologized for saying that authorities should “just kill” people experiencing homelessness and mental health crises with “involuntary lethal injection” — but it appears that he will remain in his role at “Fox & Friends.” Homelessness is at record highs and rising in the U.S. An estimated 770,000 people are experiencing homelessness across the country, as housing costs have skyrocketed, lawmakers have cut the social safety net, and Wall Street firms have bought up huge swaths of housing stock. On Sunday, Kilmeade apologized, suggesting that “not all” people experiencing homelessness are the same. “[We have] to stop these kinds of attacks by homeless, mentally ill assailants, including institutionalizing or jailing such people so they cannot attack again. During that discussion, I wrongly said they should get lethal injections. “I'm obviously aware that not all mentally ill homeless people act as the perpetrator did in North Carolina, and that so many homeless people deserve our empathy and our compassion,” he went on. Kilmeade has previously supported the killing of people experiencing homelessness. Last year, Kilmeade said that Daniel Penny was a “hero” for killing a Black unhoused man, Jordan Neely, on the subway in New York City in 2023. Some commentators have noted that dozens of people are currently losing their jobs for far less inflammatory comments about the killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk last week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since late August, Ukrainian units have regained control of several villages in the area. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi has dismissed Volodymyr Silenko and Maksym Kituhin, commanders of the 17th and 20th respective Army Corps, Ukrainska Pravda reported on Sept. 15, citing two unnamed military sources. These are the first senior personnel changes since President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Feb. 3 that the Ukrainian Armed Forces would transition to a corps-based structure. Both commanders were reportedly removed one to two weeks ago following battlefield losses in the areas under their command, according to Ukrainska Pravda. Ukraine's Brave1 defense innovation cluster has completed the final stage of testing for new kamikaze drones with a range of over 40 kilometers (25 miles), Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov announced on Sept. 15. The drones are built to withstand Russian electronic warfare systems and will soon be tested in combat. Electronic warfare has become one of Russia's key defenses against Ukraine's drone arsenal, as jamming and spoofing aim to disrupt navigation and prevent drones from striking targets. If proven resilient, the new systems could improve Ukraine's ability to strike logistics hubs, artillery positions, and equipment behind Russian lines. "Strike drones are becoming a cheap and practical solution for the front lines — they are affordable to manufacture and easily scalable," Fedorov added. Starlink, the satellite internet service owned by Elon Musk, suffered a global outage on Sept. 15, the company announced on its official website. The service has become vital for hospitals, schools, and front-line military units across Ukraine. "Starlink is once again down across the entire front line," Ukraine's top drone warfare commander, Robert "Madyar" Brovdi, wrote on Telegram. Nearly an hour later, Brovdi reported that connectivity was beginning to "gradually restore," though Starlink has not officially confirmed a full recovery. This marks the second major Starlink outage in recent months. The stakes are high for Ukraine, as Starlink has replaced much of the country's destroyed communications infrastructure and supports both civilian and military connectivity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Karen Attiah says she was dropped by newspaper after 11 years for addressing political violence, race and gun control Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah says she has been fired from the newspaper over social media posts about gun control and race in the aftermath of far right commentator Charlie Kirk's killing. Attiah, 39, recounted in a Substack post that she had been dropped as a Post columnist after 11 years for “speaking out against political violence, racial double standards, and America's apathy toward guns”. Attiah continued: “They rushed to fire me without even a conversation. This was not only a hasty overreach, but a violation of the very standards of journalistic fairness and rigor the Post claims to uphold.” Attiah said her firing was “part of a broader purge of Black voices from academia, business, government, and media – a historical pattern as dangerous as it is shameful – and tragic”. The Washington Post is under an editorial mandate for the newspaper's opinion section to focus specifically on supporting and defending “personal liberties and free markets”. A Washington Post spokesperson declined to comment on personnel matters and pointed to the organization's policies and standards, including a section governing social media use. “My only direct reference to Kirk was one post – his own words on record,” she said in her Substack letter. Attiah continued that she was pointing “to the familiar pattern of America shrugging off gun deaths and giving compassion for white men who commit and espouse political violence”. The firing described by Attiah came after the Status media newsletter – citing sources – reported in August that she had refused a buyout offer. It also comes days after MSNBC political analyst Matthew Dowd was dismissed for describing Kirk – in the aftermath of his killing – as a “divisive” figure who pushed “hate speech”. Dowd has since written his comments were “misconstrued” and MSNBC caved to pressure from a “rightwing media mob”. Dowd was one of the earliest instances of people across the US either being fired from or disciplined at their jobs amid a coordinated effort to clamp down on commentary that is critical about Kirk. O'Neal reportedly sent a memo on 14 July asserting that his “top priority will be to significantly increase the reach and effect of our work”. “Advocating for free markets and personal liberties will be critical as we rebuild trust with more Americans and scale our high quality journalism,” the memo reportedly said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor involved in the Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell and Sean Combs cases, has sued the Trump administration over her firing this summer, levying another legal challenge to the Justice Department's treatment of career officials. Comey, the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, alleges in a lawsuit filed Monday in federal court in Manhattan that she was not given any explanation for her termination and says it was done in retaliation for being her father's daughter. Rather, Defendants fired Ms. Comey solely or substantially because her father is former FBI Director James B. Comey, or because of her perceived political affiliation and beliefs, or both,” the lawsuit alleges. Comey is one of several federal civil servants fired by the Trump administration who have filed lawsuits to reinstate their positions or seek pay in a challenge to the administration's sweeping removal of FBI agents and other federal prosecutors without notice or conforming to legal procedures. Comey was notified by email just before 5 p.m. on July 16 that she had been removed from her position “pursuant to Article II of the United States Constitution,” according to the lawsuit. She said no reason was given for her termination following a near decade of positive performance reviews and promotions. Maurene Comey, fired by Trump DOJ, says ‘fear is the tool of the tyrant' in memo to her former colleagues I can't tell you anything else.” At the time of her firing CNN reported a person familiar with the situation said being a Comey is untenable in this administration given her father James Comey is “constantly going after the administration.” Comey joined the US attorney's office in November 2015 and rose through the ranks becoming chiefs of several units, but ultimately asked to rejoin her colleagues so she could get back into the courtroom. She led the questioning of several key witnesses, including of Combs' former girlfriend who testified under the pseudonym Jane. In addition to investigating and prosecuting Epstein and Maxwell, Comey also prosecuted gynecologist Robert Hadden for sexually abusing patients. Comey was fired the day after she was asked to take the lead on a “major public corruption case,” according to her lawsuit.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With global anger mounting over the nearly two-year war in Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Monday that Israel is facing a “kind of isolation” that could last for years, and has no choice but to stand on its own. Speaking at a finance ministry conference, Netanyahu said Israel's economy would need to adapt to “autarkic characteristics” – becoming more self-sufficient and less reliant on external trade. One of the key industries facing isolation is weapons trade, he said, which may force Israel to avoid reliance on foreign arms imports. We have no choice, at least for the coming years when we'll be required to deal with these isolation attempts,” he said. Netanyahu's statements mark a rare acknowledgement of the massive international backlash Israel faces as it escalates its war in Gaza. He has refused to change course, despite warnings from the United Nations and others that a looming assault on Gaza City will lead to more death and destruction, and amid mounting accusations that Israel is committing genocide in the enclave, which Israel strongly denies. The majority of its weapons imports however, come from the United States, which hasn't placed any such restrictions – and has warned others from doing so. But the prime minister has insisted on pressing ahead. For years, Israel has been considered an economic powerhouse regionally and globally, driven in large part by its vaunted high-tech industry. Netanyahu partly attributed the isolation to “an extreme Islamist agenda” which he claimed had a “very negative influence” on European foreign policy. He also said rival states – “among them Qatar” – have shaped global discourse on social media, which “puts us into a kind of isolation.” Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid slammed Netanyahu in response, dubbing his statement that Israel is entering isolation as “crazy.” Earlier Monday, Netanyahu spoke alongside US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who lavished praise on “the friendship that Israel has shown towards the United States on so many issues we've worked on together that extend beyond the causes of war and peace.” The two criticized a number of countries, including France, Canada, Australia and others that are set to recognize a Palestinian state ahead of the United Nations General Assembly this month.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez on Monday called for Israel to be banned from sports events after pro-Palestinian activists disrupted the final stage of the Spanish Vuelta cycling race in chaotic scenes in Madrid. Israel's foreign minister responded by calling Sánchez an “antisemite and a liar.” Tensions between the two countries have escalated in recent weeks as Spain's left-wing government expressed support for protesters who interrupted several stages of the Vuelta, including Sunday's final stage in Madrid, because an Israeli team was taking part. Speaking to members of his Socialist Party, Sánchez said Israel, just like Russia, should not be allowed to compete in international sports events because of its military campaign in Gaza. “The sports organizations should consider whether it's ethical for Israel to keep participating in international competitions. “Until the barbarity ends, neither Russia nor Israel should be in any international competition.” Vingegaard secures Vuelta title as race stopped by Madrid protests Authorities said two people were arrested and 22 injured, none of them seriously. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar criticized Sánchez with a post on X that included a video link to the Spanish leader's speech Monday. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't say how many were civilians or combatants. A number of countries, including the U.K. and France, have said they plan on recognizing a Palestinian state, and the European Commission's president has called for scaling back Europe's trade ties with Israel. Madrid's conservative mayor, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, also criticized Sánchez and described Sunday's events as a sad day for the Spanish capital. “Everyone has the right to protest, but not in a way that influences or endangers our race.” The teams reportedly improvised a private podium ceremony later so riders could celebrate. “Instead I want to praise the athletes and everyone who doesn't spoil things for others,” she wrote on Instagram. “We never got into any other type of debate. “This position is contradictory to the Olympic values of unity, mutual respect, and peace. It also calls into question Spain's ability to host major international sporting events, ensuring that they take place in safe conditions and in accordance with the principles of the Olympic Charter.” Guillén said the Vuelta protests would likely have implications for future sports events with Israeli participants. Next year's Tour de France begins with a stage in Barcelona. “Hopefully everything will be solved by then,” he said. “I don't want to speculate with any possibilities. I'm sure Barcelona will have a great Tour de France.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The European Union is veering down a troubling path of restrictive practices, with countries encircling themselves in "barbed wire" and repeatedly imposing bans on their own citizens, according to Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. "Suddenly, they have surrounded themselves with barbed wire, constantly restricting their own citizens from certain freedoms." I believe soon there will be nothing left to say." Zakharova highlighted the barriers Poland has erected for Russian and Belarusian citizens seeking to visit the EU. "Look at the numerous obstacles Poland has placed in the way of Belarusian and Russian visitors - denying visas and provoking incidents," she noted. In contrast, Zakharova pointed to Belarus's openness. "Belarus has always welcomed Polish citizens," she said. I encountered Polish license plates and met Poles who had come for tourism, shopping, or leisure. Many came simply because Belarus offers better and more affordable goods." "There is a friendly population eager to build relationships and develop cooperation," Zakharova asserted. They have gone so far as to barricade their borders to prevent their citizens from experiencing the truth firsthand." On September 9, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced the closure of Poland's border with Belarus, effective from the night of September 11-12. The closure applies to both entry and exit, affecting individuals as well as freight transportation by road and rail, and will remain in place "until further notice." The Belarusian Foreign Ministry condemned Warsaw's decision, describing it as unfounded and harmful to ordinary people. Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry urged Poland to reconsider its actions, warning of potential repercussions and calling for the border closure to be reversed as soon as possible.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO, has purchased nearly $1bn worth of the electric-vehicle maker's stock, a regulatory filing showed, reinforcing Musk's push for greater control over Tesla. Tesla shares jumped more than 8% in premarket trading on Monday following the news. As of December, Musk held a roughly 13% stake, according to LSEG data. Musk disclosed buying 2.57m shares in open-market transactions on Friday, paying between $372.37 and $396.54 per share, according to the filing. Tesla shares jumped more than 7% on Friday, extending solid gains from the previous session. The stock, which is down about 2% this year, is on track to record a third straight session of gains if premarket moves are sustained. Musk has consistently demanded a bigger stake and increased voting power at Tesla, having also threatened to build AI and robotics products outside of Tesla if he cannot get 25% voting power. Earlier this month, Tesla's board proposed a trillion-dollar compensation plan for Musk, in a huge vote of confidence for Musk's leadership from the board, even as the company stumbles amid heated competition and flailing EV demand. On Friday, board chair Robyn Denholm dismissed concerns that Musk's political activity had hurt sales and said the billionaire was back “front and center” at the company after several months at the White House. Musk's political activity and public clashes with Donald Trump had stirred worries among investors about distractions and potential lost sales, weighing on the company's stock this year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By providing military assistance to Ukraine, NATO countries are "at war" with Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian journalists during a Sept. 15 briefing. NATO provides direct and indirect support to the Kyiv regime," Peskov said, repeating Moscow's narrative that Western backing for Ukraine equals participation in the war. The remarks came just days after Poland confirmed it had shot down Russian drones in its airspace, the first known case of a NATO member downing Moscow's military assets over its own territory. A disinformation analysis center by NASK, Poland's national research institute, has reported an increased disinformation activity among Russian and Belarusian sources shortly after the incident. One of the narratives listed by Polish researchers is that the incursion means Poland is effectively at war with Russia — a false claim that could "cause panic among the public," NASK warns. Poland and other NATO members are not combatants in the Russia-Ukraine war but have supplied Kyiv with weapons, training, and financial aid to support its right to self-defense against Russia's full-scale invasion. The only country waging war in Ukraine is Russia. Russian disinformation narratives identified by NASK are often contradictory, ranging from denying the incident altogether to blaming Ukraine, claiming Kyiv seeks to draw Poland and NATO into an open war with Russia. Res Futura, a Polish NGO, also said the incursion was followed by an organized psychological operation (PSYOP) aimed at "escalating emotions, polarizing public opinion," and undermining trust in the Polish state and its allies. As a result, the narrative portraying the incident as a "Ukrainian provocation" and a "false flag" operation was dominant among social media commentators (38%), followed by those blaming Russia (34%), according to the analysis. "The drone attack was used not only as a military incident, but above all as a tool of psychological warfare," Res Futura's report read. Romania also scrambled F-16 fighter jets on Sept. 13 after detecting a drone crossing into its airspace during a Russian strike near the Ukrainian border. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the drone entered Romanian territory for nearly an hour. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas described the incident as a "reckless escalation." Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, known for incendiary rhetoric, warned that any NATO move to enforce a no-fly zone would mean "war between NATO and Russia." Warsaw has since triggered NATO's Article 4, which allows consultations when a member believes its security is threatened. NATO has also launched its Eastern Sentry mission following the incident.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Ryan C. Berg, Daniel Byman, Iselin Brady, Riley McCabe, Alexander Palmer, and Henry Ziemer Since returning to the White House, U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged to defeat the Western Hemisphere's violent drug traffickers by any means necessary. In a March address to Congress, Trump declared, “The cartels are waging war in America, and it's time for America to wage war on the cartels.” Over the last several months, his administration has designated 13 cartels and criminal groups, including six based in Mexico and two in Venezuela, as foreign terrorist organizations. In July, Trump directed the Department of Defense to prepare such plans. Then, in September, the U.S. military struck what administration officials claimed was a vessel used by members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to smuggle drugs, killing 11. But there is a more productive path forward than drastically shifting the rules of engagement with transnational criminal groups. More extensive border measures, increased bilateral security coordination, and more frequent (but not more lethal) maritime interdiction efforts can accomplish just as much as unilateral U.S. military interventions using drones and special operations forces would, all while limiting risk to U.S. personnel and mitigating blowback. Fueled by weak Mexican state capacity (and by complicity), demand for illicit drugs in the United States, and a steady flow of guns south, violent transnational criminal groups have morphed from relatively small-scale trafficking operations to sophisticated organizations, combining the financial networks and political influence of multinational corporations with the lethality of private military contractors. Although Mexico, with U.S. assistance, has achieved many operational successes in its decades-long battle against the cartels, the fight is, at best, at a stalemate. Mexico's 2006 “kingpin strategy,” which targeted cartel leaders, actually increased violence. In 2008, when the Mérida Initiative institutionalized U.S.-Mexican security cooperation, Mexico's homicide rate stood at about eight murders per 100,000 inhabitants. “Hugs, not bullets” was no more successful than the Mérida Initiative, however, eventually becoming a byword for government passivity in the face of spiraling criminal violence. Sheinbaum, López Obrador's successor, has forged a different path. On the first day of his new term, Trump signed an executive order that described cartels as national security risks to the United States and vowed their “total elimination.” The subsequent designation of several transnational criminal organizations as foreign terrorist organizations made available new legal tools to bring charges against those who provide financial or other material support to these groups. The Department of Justice has previously brought material support charges against individuals in the United States who have provided time, labor, or financial assistance to help suspected members of terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda. Like insurgents in Afghanistan and Somalia, the cartels are nonstate actors that take advantage of state failure to exert authority over large swaths of territory. Like the Islamic State (ISIS), cartels use violence to spread fear and achieve their goals through intimidation. And like many terrorist groups, cartels are organized as networks of smaller cells, often with international links. Furthermore, Mexico is not a faraway country but a U.S. neighbor with much deeper cultural, historical, and diplomatic ties to the United States than Afghanistan or Iraq have. U.S. counterterrorism and counterinsurgency methods, if they are used, must be modified to reflect these differences. In Mexico, many cartels exhibit poor operational security, enabling intelligence agencies to intercept their communications, track their movements, and compile information about organization membership, hierarchy, activities, operating structure, and patterns of behavior. Once cartel members are captured, intelligence is also necessary to prosecute them in courts of law. In June, for example, the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network identified three Mexican financial institutions suspected of involvement in cartel-related money laundering, prohibiting certain economic transactions involving these banks. As long as Washington continues to share its information with trusted agencies within the Mexican government, Mexican security forces can use it to interdict cartel activity. As Washington considers military options short of an invasion, one that became a common tool in counterterrorism campaigns is raids by special operations forces. Carried out in countries including Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, and Syria, such raids eliminated senior terrorist leaders including al-Qaeda's Osama bin Laden and ISIS's Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, degraded or dismantled insurgent cells, and provided opportunities to gather intelligence that enabled subsequent operations. Yet there can be steep costs if the raid goes wrong. Sobering examples include a 2017 raid in Yakla, Yemen, which left one Navy SEAL dead and several others wounded, and the 1993 Operation Gothic Serpent in Mogadishu, Somalia, which triggered a firefight that resulted in the deaths of 18 U.S. soldiers and hundreds of Somalis. Failed or controversial raids can provoke political scrutiny and erode public support for ongoing military operations. Civilian casualties, such as those in the 2017 Yakla raid, can further undermine local support and serve as powerful propaganda for militant groups. In theory, special operations forces deployed to Mexico could eliminate cartel members, disrupt hubs of drug and human trafficking activities, and collect actionable intelligence in the process. But carrying out such raids would come with considerable risk. These operations always endanger U.S. personnel and, especially when they happen in densely populated urban areas, risk collateral damage. A botched operation would also jeopardize broader security cooperation with the Mexican government. Over decades of U.S. counterterrorism efforts, drones have been used in one-off strikes against top leadership and in sustained campaigns targeting the middle ranks of an organization. Sustained drone strikes against al-Qaeda in Pakistan removed key figures, disrupted communications and organizational processes, forced leaders into hiding, and prevented the establishment of large-scale training camps. Yet even successful drone campaigns rarely destroy a group entirely. They force decentralization, which does make it harder for terrorist groups, especially those with far-flung affiliates, to coordinate globally and carry out acts of spectacular violence that require a high degree of training and skill. Moreover, U.S. drone campaigns have resulted in significant numbers of civilian deaths. The U.S. drone campaign in Pakistan from 2004 to 2018, for example, killed between 303 and 969 Pakistani civilians. A drone campaign against cartels in Mexico might kill leaders, disrupt the transport of drugs, and destroy production facilities. But this sort of drone campaign would face strong headwinds. Cartels are primarily motivated by profit, so their leadership is generally easier to replace than that of ideological terrorist groups because of the material benefits that usually accompany membership in a cartel. Leadership decapitation also tends to be more successful for small (less than 500 members), new (fewer than ten years old), and centralized networks. Given the risks of and likely backlash to both drone strikes and targeted raids, the United States should consider other strategies to suppress Mexico's cartel operations. Some of the U.S. military's most expansive counterterrorism efforts have involved securing territory to exert pressure on and deny safe haven to terrorist groups. To impede smuggling routes and disrupt cartel operations, the United States could establish a buffer zone along the U.S.-Mexican border, perhaps extending into northern Mexico, by increasing border patrol and military deployments, as well as defensive measures such as physical barriers and sensors. Maritime buffers, established by increasing U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Navy patrols and maritime surveillance, could also prevent cartels from island hopping between countries in the Caribbean with poor littoral security to move drugs and precursor chemicals without detection. A more ambitious alternative would see U.S. forces work with Mexican forces to seize and occupy key cartel strongholds deep in Mexican territory, including in Sinaloa, Michoacán, Jalisco, and Tamaulipas. But sending U.S. forces into the Mexican interior would demand a significant commitment of personnel, provoke cartel retaliation, risk prolonged conflict in occupied areas, and jeopardize the Sheinbaum administration's cooperation. And even if military operations were coordinated with the Mexican government, they could lead to a fierce backlash in Mexico against the United States. Sticking to buffer zones would not come without risk: this strategy would endanger U.S. personnel and require long-term joint operations with the Mexican army. But the risk would be lower than in a larger occupation of cartel territory, and this approach could still enable important gains, such as denying traffickers access to key corridors, disrupting cross-border activity, exposing cartel movements to greater surveillance and interdiction, and creating secure staging areas for U.S. intelligence collection and rapid response operations in Mexico. Finally, U.S. counterterrorism strategies have often included efforts to improve the capacity of partner governments and their military forces, which may be poorly trained, corrupt, brutal, and politicized, in an attempt to prepare them to fight terrorists on their own. Partner governments typically welcome these efforts; unlike unilateral U.S. military action, they do not threaten the country's sovereignty. Building the capacity of a partner, however, is difficult. Not only does U.S. training often fail to guarantee respect for human rights or improve norms of civilian control; it often fails to equip a foreign military for victory. Mexico's track record does not necessarily promise a better outcome. Mexican security forces have already been receiving U.S. training and aid for years, yet their capacity is still lacking, and cartel-linked corruption is common at all levels of government. Recently uncovered networks of fuel theft in the armed forces do not inspire confidence. Nonetheless, Sheinbaum is under intense political pressure, from both Washington and from many Mexicans rightly preoccupied with violence, to deliver security gains. Washington would no doubt do some damage to major drug cartels, but the overall flow of drugs might not change substantially, and violence in Mexico might increase as the chaos leads to competition among surviving groups. Some cartels could even conduct revenge attacks across the border. Mexico could end its migration and security cooperation, reducing overall pressure on cartels and curtailing enforcement actions with long track records of success, even as showy U.S. efforts proceed. The resulting anger in Mexico could easily spill over into other areas of the U.S.-Mexican partnership, including trade, undermining one of Washington's most important economic and diplomatic relationships. But to embrace the entire U.S. counterterrorism playbook without considering what may and may not work against the cartels would be to court catastrophe.

MOSCOW, September 15. /TASS/. Vladimir Zelensky's Western backers will not allow him to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow to prevent the Kiev leader from "messing things up," Russian senator from the Kherson Region Igor Kastyukevich said in an interview with TASS.

"Zelensky coordinates every step with Western curators, even though he still manages to mess things up. That's why no one will let him into Moscow. Moreover, he is partly responsible for the crisis, as he was brought to power through a military coup. I think a meeting at the highest level is possible, but it would require a lot of preliminary work," Kastyukevich said.

Earlier, following his visit to China in early September, Putin said he was ready to invite Zelensky to Moscow if he wished to meet. However, during a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron, Zelensky declined the offer. Later, speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum, Putin described Moscow as the best venue for a potential meeting and noted that Russia was prepared to guarantee the safety of both Zelensky and his representatives if they decided to come.</p>
