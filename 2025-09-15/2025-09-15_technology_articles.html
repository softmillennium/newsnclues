                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The generative AI industry has promised to “disrupt” society, and on that front, it can be said to have succeeded. AI has certainly disrupted many parts of society, including education, social media, and politics. Most of all, it seems to have disrupted the tech industry itself, where what was once a profitable career (software development) increasingly seems to be more of a precarious one, thanks to the rise of so-called “vibe coding”—a form of AI-assisted software development that requires less experience and more automation. This whole vibe coding thing doesn't seem to be working out for companies, however, as generating code via an LLM prompt at breakneck speed can, predictably, lead to less-than-stellar work. Now, in an ironic twist, it seems that, having dispensed with more skilled coders for the cheap effectiveness of a chatbot-aided code monkey, companies are having to hire additional contractors to fix the AI's screw-ups. The outlet cites one description shared with them by a specialist, who said his particular expertise was to “polish” up codebases that might be a little rough around the edges: “I've been offering vibe coding fixer services for about two years now, starting in late 2023. Currently, I work with around 15-20 clients regularly, with additional one-off projects throughout the year,” Hamid Siddiqi, who offers to “review, fix your vibe code” on Fiverr, told me in an email. “I started fixing vibe-coded projects because I noticed a growing number of developers and small teams struggling to refine AI-generated code that was functional but lacked the polish or ‘vibe' needed to align with their vision. I saw an opportunity to bridge that gap, combining my coding expertise with an eye for aesthetic and user experience.” Siddiqi told 404 that he commonly assists companies with “inconsistent UI/UX design in AI-generated frontends, poorly optimized code that impacts performance, misaligned branding elements, and features that function but feel clunky or unintuitive.” Yet another cleanup specialist, Swatantra Sohni, told the outlet that they think AI is being leveraged by people who don't otherwise have the digital skills to build products. Vibe coding is, at the moment, kind of like infancy. It's very handy to convey the prototype they want, but I don't think they are really intended to make it like a production grade app.” As with many other AI-led industries, humans are still necessary after all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Sunday, Russia released images of its launch of a 3M22 Zircon hypersonic missile from a frigate in the Barents Sea, in the Arctic Ocean, near NATO borders. It also serves to show that Russia's military force has not lost its strength, despite heavy losses more than three years after the start of the invasion of Ukraine. The images also show exercises with Sukoi Su-34 supersonic fighter-bombers, a two-seater fighter-bomber that can carry up to eight tons of armament and can fly up to 2,485 miles (4,000 kilometers) without refueling (or more than 4,350 miles, or 7,000 km, with external tanks). There is evidence that Russia has employed hypersonic missiles against civilian targets in Ukraine, such as the Zircon or Kinzhal, which are virtually impossible to intercept. This is not only because of their speed, but also because of their maneuvering capabilities, allowing them to change course mid-flight to evade defense systems (albeit in a limited way). This week, NATO set off international alarms due to a series of Russian drone incursions into Polish and Romanian airspace, a violation that had not been recorded so far in the Russia-Ukraine war, at least not on this scale. On September 10, at least 19 drones from Russia invaded Polish airspace, being intercepted and shot down by NATO fighters with no major damage on the ground. The incident was described by the Polish government as an "unprecedented violation" and a “large-scale provocation,” expressions shared by Mark Rutte, NATO's secretary general. Poland then invoked Article 4 of the NATO Charter, which establishes a mechanism for consultation between NATO members “to exchange views and information and discuss issues before reaching agreement and taking action.” Following this debate among member countries, they launched Operation Eastern Sentinel, a military initiative to strengthen the defensive posture on the alliance's eastern flank through the deployment of advanced fighters and defense systems, among other measures, to counter missile and drone threats. The alerts were triggered again on September 13, when Romania detected a drone, allegedly from Russia, in its airspace. Russian drone incursions into NATO airspace generated widespread international condemnation. “We consider this an unacceptable, regrettable and dangerous event,” said Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state. Notwithstanding the attempts to offer explanations, the joint Zapad 2025 military exercises between Russia and Belarus do little to reduce tensions in Eastern Europe.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>iOS 26's marquee feature is Apple's Liquid Glass design, which includes elements on screen that resembled a “glassy” look. The operating system update also went through a big numerical change as Apple jumped from iOS 18 to iOS 26 for two key reasons. First, it wanted to bring all operating systems — iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and VisionOS — in sync. Liquid Glass design has been the most significant visual overhaul for iOS in years. Apple's intention with this redesign was to take inspiration from the Vision Pro interface and apply it to all of its operating systems. Since June, Apple has made changes to how “glassy” the interface looks multiple times through beta releases. This visual change might take a bit of time for users to adjust, and they might not like certain elements right away. The Phone app has a new unified look where your favorites are up top in a card format with recents and voicemails on the same screen. (If you don't like the new interface, Apple also gives you an option to switch to the classic look.) Transcription of voicemail doesn't work well for all languages, but call screening has reduced the number of calls I've had to pick up. The Messages app is getting to feature party with other chat apps like WhatsApp and Telegram with backgrounds, new conversation flow, polls, text selection, photo previews, and typing indicators in groups. Apple has been working on SMS filtering for a few years now. The company said it updated its spam filtering with this release. Plus, it places messages from unknown senders in a new folder. One thing I didn't like about this update is that it takes me a couple of taps to go to the transactions tab. The games app overhaul means that you can look at the games you are playing (or have played), arcade games, challenges, and achievements in one place, along with suggestions for new titles. The app also shows you what your friends are playing. Apple finally added Mac's Preview app to iOS 26, which means you can edit, annotate, and sign PDFs more easily. Meanwhile, Apple Music now has automixing for dynamic song switching, along with lyrics translation and pronunciation. What's more, you can pin your favorite songs and playlists. With iOS 26, Apple Maps lets you define preferred routes while commuting. In case your choice of route has more traffic or any incidents, Maps sends you a notification along with suggesting alternative routes. Apple has placed some controls like Flash and Night mode on the top right, and you can switch them on/off with one touch. For more options like filters, styles, exposure controls, and timer, you can swipe up from the bottom of the screen. Unlike last year's grand launch of Apple Intelligence, this year's operating system is light on AI features, especially given delays in launching and rolling out features. The company is making AI-powered translation easily available in apps like Messages, FaceTime, and Phone. Currently, this feature supports English (UK, US), French (France), German, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish (Spain). Apple is also releasing its own “Circle to search” called Highlight. Because of this, it takes an extra step to save a screenshot, and I have forgotten to save some important screenshots. Apple is updating Genmoji with iOS 26 to let you merge two emojis with a text prompt and make something new. You can now add expression to people in both Genmoji and Image Playground. Update to Image Playground now allows you to modify attributes like hair and facial hair, along with new styles from ChatGPT. Ivan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The old debate of form over function remains true with iOS 26 and the final version that launched for all iPhones today. There's all but a faint whiff of that long-promised Apple Intelligence, though you'll still find plenty to love and more to complain about with the switch from iOS 18 all the way to the “26” generation. Remember to set aside some storage on iPhone, as the update will demand a good chunk. Our senior editor, Raymond Wong, got the update on his iPhone 16 Pro and noted it was 14.9GB. Along with iOS 26, Apple also released iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, visionOS 26, and all the rest. Every Apple product now shares a similar design language centered on the “Liquid Glass” look. For instance, the “Search” button on iPhones may blend more into your background wallpaper. Users didn't appreciate having to watch short animations before getting into their apps. Despite the controversy, skeuomorphism—where Apple tried incorporating more familiar images and designs, such as the battery image representing battery life—still remains to this day. That brings us to now and the emphasis on “glassmorphism,” emphasizing opaque windows for a pseudo-3D effect. As somebody who has used multiple versions of the iPadOS 26 and macOS 26 betas extensively during the beta period this past summer, I appreciated some design changes more than others. Clicking on those notifications also opens up the iPhone Mirroring, a feature that was introduced in last year's macOS Sequoia. There's no more Launchpad available in the dock, and to bring it back you need to muck around in Terminal. Instead, you're granted an “Apps” folder that is overloaded with all your iPhone apps in addition to those you installed on Mac. macOS 26 also sports a few more minor additions, like the largely ineffectual Game Overlay. All that functionality is now bedecked in the translucent layer of glass, from your app icons to the Control Center. The real innovation was saved for Apple's tablets. The iPad is now far more usable as a dedicated laptop replacement for all your tasks. Apple added the ability to have multiple apps open on-screen at once. If you want to watch YouTube and type up your notes, it's now easier than the previous Stage Manager or dual-screen solutions. Apple has fine-tuned Liquid Glass from its initial dev beta into the public beta and again for the final release. The latest public betas honed in on the current design, where you can catch a hint of content underneath menus, as if staring into a pool of glassy water. The effect wants to evoke something tangible, like you're doing more than scrolling pixels on a pane of glass. After months of playing with all the various betas, I still would prefer a version of Liquid Glass that matches up to the name. Regular Apple users who use their iPhone for little more than accessing their camera or their TikTok feeds may not understand the hate, but the most-dedicated iPhone aficionados may grow impatient with the new design. Critics say Liquid Glass distracts you from the functions of each app. Some developers publicly lambasted the new design that sticks important functionality behind hamburger menus (those three horizontal bars that open up drop-down menus). Then again, that's a fact of life for living in Apple's ecosystem. The company is more concerned with devices that focus apps for specific use types. Inevitably, you'll run up against a single instance where the glass garbles words or distracts you from an important part of a text or email. After those fleeting moments where the raw hate overflows, you'll just keep using your devices the way you always have. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Soin's background also includes nearly a decade at Microsoft, where he was group program manager for Bing social initiatives. “As we continue to scale and expand our AI capabilities, Ravi's leadership will be instrumental in reinforcing our commitment to security excellence and delivering a trusted enterprise experience for our global customers,” said Cynthia Tee, Smartsheet's chief technology officer, in a statement. — After nearly 16 years with Amazon, attorney Mark Hoffman has left the company. Hoffman said at Amazon he was “fortunate to have found such a wonderful group of smart, dedicated, creative, fun, and honorable people with whom to work.” “Onward to travel, family time, board service, obscure hobbies, and all that the next chapter brings,” he added. — Former Carbon CEO Derek Tu joined Stacklok as director of product management. The Seattle startup is developing AI assistants, agents and models. Sunga's past roles include management positions at multiple Seattle companies including Aura, Mighty AI, Amazon and TeachStreet. — Sarah Bell is now pipeline and portfolio lead for E8 Angels, a Seattle-based, climate-focused investment organization. Prior to her new role, Bell was an operating partner and chief of staff at LeapSheep for nine years, helping startup founders navigate business development challenges. “[Bell] is passionate about accelerating the clean energy transition while expanding opportunities for both investors and entrepreneurs,” E8 posted on LinkedIn, noting her expertise in climate tech, agtech and space tech. — Christin Camacho left her role as vice president of marketing for Seattle's LevelTen Energy after nearly seven years with the company. “We built awareness that there was a better, faster way to do deals with clean energy projects, helping LevelTen facilitate over $25 billion in clean energy transactions and over 150 [power purchase agreements] since 2018,” she said on LinkedIn. The startup, which runs an online marketplace facilitating clean energy projects, disclosed in August that it was laying off 60 employees. Camacho is looking for a role in clean energy, corporate sustainability, regenerative agriculture or social impact.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than 200 contractors who worked on evaluating and improving Google's AI products have been laid off without warning in at least two rounds of layoffs last month. In the past few years, Google has outsourced its AI rating work—which includes evaluating, editing, or rewriting the Gemini chatbot's response to make it sound more human and “intelligent”—to thousands of contractors employed by Hitachi-owned GlobalLogic and other outsourcing companies. Most raters working at GlobalLogic are based in the US and deal with English-language content. Just as content moderators help purge and classify content on social media, these workers use their expertise, skill, and judgment to teach chatbots and other AI products, including Google's search summaries feature called AI Overviews—the right responses on a wide range of subjects. Workers allege that the latest cuts come amid attempts to quash their protests over issues including pay and job insecurity. These workers, who often are hired because of their specialist knowledge, had to have either a master's or a PhD to join the super rater program, and typically include writers, teachers, and people from creative fields. “I was just cut off,” says Andrew Lauzon, who received an email with the news of his termination on August 15. “I asked for a reason, and they said ramp-down on the project—whatever that means.” He joined GlobalLogic in March 2024, where his work ranged from rating AI outputs to coming up with a variety of prompts to feed into the model. He alleges that GlobalLogic started regularly laying off its workers this year. According to internal documents viewed by WIRED, GlobalLogic seems to be using these human raters to train the Google AI system that could automatically rate the responses, with the aim of replacing them with AI. At the same time, the company is also finding ways to get rid of current employees as it continues to hire new workers. These alleged conditions have impacted worker morale and challenged the ability for people to execute their jobs well, sources say. Some contractors attempted to unionize earlier this year but claim those efforts were quashed. Now they allege that the company has retaliated against them. Two workers have filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, alleging they were unfairly fired, one due to bringing up wage transparency issues, and the other for advocating for himself and his coworkers. We take our supplier relations seriously and audit the companies we work with against our Supplier Code of Conduct.” GlobalLogic declined to comment. In the spring of 2023, Google asked GlobalLogic to assemble a team of “super raters” to evaluate its AI products, starting with AI Overviews. Ricardo Levario, a teacher from Texas, was hired among the first batch of super raters. Back then he worked on Google's “search generative experience,” where the search results would display an AI generated summary—now renamed AI Overviews. His job was to determine how well the model performed and rewrite its responses to make sure it was grounded and made better use of sources. “After the success [of this pilot], we learned that Google was interested in growing the program, and they were going to bring on cohorts of 20 people every week,” says Levario, adding that the company eventually ended up hiring as many as 2,000 super raters to work on Google's AI. But problems began when GlobalLogic started using third-party contractors to ramp up hiring, Levario claims—because while GlobalLogic super raters' pay ranged from $28 to $32 an hour, the super raters brought in via third-party contractors were paid $18 to $22 an hour for the same work. The company also has a few hundred “generalist raters” for its AI products who don't necessarily have a higher degree like the super raters. One such generalist rater, Alex, who was hired in 2023 to rate the bot's output based on the guidelines provided—which included “fluffier” questions like asking about the closest restaurant but also “not as savory” ones. (Alex requested that WIRED identify her by first name only due to privacy concerns). “We're like the lifeguards on the beach—we're there to make sure nothing bad happens.” Alex was eventually able to secure a full time position with GlobalLogic, but she alleges that roughly 80 percent of her project folks continue to be on contract, without any benefits or paid time off. At the end of 2023, workers created a WhatsApp group named Super Secret Secondary Location with around 80 members where some of them started discussing ways to organize. Alex, along with several other workers, was pulled into a project a few months prior which she initially thought would lead to promotions. Alex says that in this project, their task timers were set at five minutes, raising concerns amongst her and her coworkers that they are “sacrificing quality at this point.” “I don't even keep count of how many I do in a day,” says Alex. “I just focus more on the timer than anything else—it's gone from mentally stimulating work to mind-numbing.” She added that she often does not reach that metric of completing each task within five minutes and that the company has been “threatening many of us with losing our job or the project in general if we don't get these numbers down.” In January when a worker quit and left messages on their social channels and via email asking the workers to organize, things started to spiral. “GlobalLogic's reaction was to suppress the conversation, so they began deleting threads,” claims Levario. “One team lead even told us that we were violating company policies, which wasn't true—there was no company policy around that.” Later that month, to channel this worker agitation into action, Levario—who was one of the more vocal organizers—shared a pay and condition survey in the social channels. This worked, and the union membership grew from 18 to 60 by February. In the first week of February, many workers received an email saying that the company's social channels—which was a way for all the remote workers to connect and forge friendships—were banned from use during work hours. “It's important especially in a remote environment where you don't get to see your coworkers face-to-face.” Frontera joined GlobalLogic as a generalist rater to annotate, proofread, and write responses for Gemini and Magi, which is Google's new project to integrate AI in search. “I believe that [because] the union was happening, people were discussing their pay and stuff, painting a bad picture” of GlobalLogic, claims a super rater who joined the company two years ago, requesting anonymity to speak freely. “And so they did it as a means to stop us from communicating with one another and that's what made the environment hostile.” Labor researchers allege this is how it typically plays out around the world with contracting agencies and workers. “This is the playbook,” says Mila Miceli, a research lead at DAIR Institute, an organization that works with AI data workers around the globe. “We have seen this in other places, almost every outsourcing company doing data work where workers have tried to collectivize and organize—this has been difficult. Earlier this year, a group of Kenyan AI data labelers formed the Data Labelers Association in a bid to fight for better pay and working conditions and mental health support. The Global Trade Union Alliance of Content Moderators includes workers from Kenya, Turkey, and Colombia. “It's just been kind of [an] oppressive atmosphere,” says Alex.

Video game publisher 2K Games has released an extensive list of recommended graphics settings for Borderlands 4 across Nvidia and AMD GPUs at 1080p, 1440p, and 4K. These presets are said to offer players a reliable baseline, something that many found missing right after the game's launch last week. If we look at Nvidia, the minimum requirements list the RTX 2070, which can barely scrape by at 1080p, managing just 30 FPS with DLSS upscaling, along with low settings for textures, shadows, and foliage. A smoother 60 FPS gaming experience at 1080p requires an RTX 3060 Ti. On paper, the RTX 5090 stands out as the most powerful gaming graphics card available, and Borderlands 4 puts that muscle to good use. Notably, these recommendations only target a minimum of 60 FPS, which feels less than impressive for a flagship-grade GPU that costs upwards of $3,000. On the other hand, the Radeon RX 5700 XT from AMD serves as an entry point for 1080p, although this can only be achieved using FSR and reduced settings for shadows and lighting to maintain frame rates at 60 FPS and above. As for mid-range GPUs like the RX 6700 XT and RX 7700 XT, they should be good enough at 1440p while maintaining much of the game's visual quality. At the higher end, the RX 6950 XT and RX 7900 XTX push into 4K territory, but still rely on FSR in Balanced or Performance mode to deliver consistent performance. Players have reportedly been running into all sorts of issues, ranging from low frame rates, stuttering, and crashes, even on top-tier graphics cards like the RTX 5090. While a 2.7GB day-one patch improved stability and fixed some crashes and errors, reports of inconsistent performance continue to surface. Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford acknowledged the situation, noting that players with systems below spec or without SSDs would likely struggle.

Even with Nvidia's latest RTX 50-series and AMD's Radeon 9000-series GPUs, players are expected to lean on upscaling and frame generation to achieve smooth performance at higher resolutions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday that the U.S. has “a framework for a TikTok deal,” suggesting that some kind of agreement is imminent to allow the social media platform to continue operating in the U.S. despite a law passed in 2024 that sought to ban the app or force a sale. The comments from Bessent came as he and U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer took questions from reporters after two days of meetings with Chinese officials in Madrid. Greer was asked about whether there would be any further extensions beyond Wednesday's deadline, and he said that if there were, it would be “some period of time just to get it signed,” but “we're not going to be in the business of having repetitive extensions.” Congress passed a law in 2024, signed by President Joe Biden, that said Bytedance is required to sell TikTok to American interests or be banned entirely in the U.S. And then Trump signed an executive order extending it again until June. That was then extended yet again until Sept. 17, which is this Wednesday. When Bessent was asked by reporters about timing, he deflected but confirmed that the framework involves control by U.S. interests. “But again, I'm not going to get ahead of the leaders' call on Friday. U.S. negotiators in Spain talked about a range of trade issues, including tariffs and rare earth minerals, in talks Sunday and Monday. The U.S. has placed high tariffs on China (30% on most imported goods), but even higher tariffs (145%) have been paused until November. President Trump suggested there was a deal even before Bessent talked with reporters Monday, describing a “certain” company in terms that looked like an attempt to be vague while also being incredibly obvious. In one of several posts to Truth Social on Monday morning, Trump did his best wink-wink about TikTok. “A deal was also reached on a ‘certain' company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save. I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday. Trump was actually the one to first sign an executive order trying to ban TikTok during his first term. It's unclear why Trump changed his mind so drastically, but pundits noticed at the time that he had recently spoken with Republican mega-donor Jeff Yass, a billionaire with a big investment in ByteDance. Bytedance has repeatedly said it's not interested in selling TikTok, and it's not clear what exactly is being worked out behind closed doors. Several potential U.S. buyers have come forward, but one of the biggest sticking points is TikTok's algorithm, which is considered its secret sauce and the reason people become addicted to it. Without the algorithm, you've just got a recognizable name. But if Chinese officials still don't want the U.S. to have control of the algorithm, it's unclear where that would leave a potential deal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tin Can has struck a chord — with parents, kids, and now venture capitalists. “I think you can legitimately say Tin Can is one of the fastest growing and most viral businesses I have seen in more than 25 years of venture investing,” Greg Gottesman, managing director at Seattle-based PSL, told GeekWire. Its colorful WiFi-enabled landline phones — shaped like oversized tin cans — let kids talk to one another without screens, texting and apps. The 7-person company quickly sold out its first two batches of products and is now taking pre-orders for shipments in December. “We started by building a phone just for our own kids, and it's been amazing to see that snowball into something much bigger that clearly resonates with families everywhere,” said Tin Can co-founder and CEO Chet Kittleson. Tin Can's early success comes amid mounting concern over the impact of smartphones and social media on kids' mental health, attention spans, and social development. “Parents everywhere are grappling with how to give their kids independence without handing them the internet too soon,” Kittleson said. “That cultural shift — away from screens and toward more analogue forms of connection — has been a huge tailwind for us.” Tin Can phones are priced at $75 and sold directly to families. Parents can choose between two calling plans — a free version that allows calling to other Tin Can devices, and a $9.99/month version that enables calls to approved outside numbers (cell phones, landlines). Kittleson said even grandparents say calls with Tin Can phones are “more thoughtful, more focused” — especially compared to “dizzying FaceTime tours of the living room.” Kittleson founded Tin Can with Graeme Davies and Max Blumen, his former colleauges at Seattle real estate startup Far Homes, which shut down last year. Vivek Ladsariya, managing director at PSL, praised the company's mission-driven approach.

The company explains that PayPal Me links are not payment requests tied to a specific amount — at least until the receiver inputs how much they plan to pay. PayPal Me links were only used to get paid. This makes the feature more useful for one-time payments or requests directly with another person without needing to identify and verify their profile or account information. As a result, there are fewer steps involved, making the payments faster. In addition, PayPal links will soon be able to support crypto in the U.S., allowing users to send Bitcoin, Ethereum, PYUSD, and more to PayPal, Venmo, and other digital wallets that support crypto and stablecoins. Any unclaimed links expire after 10 days, though users can send out a reminder or cancel the payment link at any time, if needed. Personal payments remain exempt from 1099-K reporting, the company notes.

Inspired by his growing collection of these disposables, and prior work he had done on semihosting on any Arm CPU using “a few lines of code,” Bogdan had a lightbulb moment and decided to host “a web server on a vape,” thus creating the VapeServer. Disposable vapes can contain a surprising amount of computing power/components. However, he recently became aware of “fancier” units that pack more advanced ICs and microcontrollers. They didn't just contain PCBs with unknown ‘blob chips.' Bogdan says one of the fancier units he disassembled contained an IC marked ‘PUYA C642F15.' Those are not stellar specs, and perhaps “about 100x slower” than a 10-year-old mobile, by our hero's estimation. For web serving, though, Bogdan thought the PY32F002B-powered ex-vape with USB-C port could be leveraged to make a “blazingly fast” device. Optimization to get a usably performant web server presented several challenges. Pings were ~1.5s, and a simple page load took 20 seconds. However, he humbly admits the big issue was his code. So the engineer added a buffer and batched writes to improve throughput, and with a few more tweaks managed to get pings down to 20ms with no packet loss, and full-page loading in about 160ms.

The computing market is absolutely ablaze with AI-driven growth. But the storage market is also under pressure, especially hard drive vendors who purportedly haven't done much to increase manufacturing capacity in a decade. TrendForce says lead times for high-capacity "nearline" hard drives have ballooned to over 52 weeks — more than a full year. TredForce posted two articles on essentially the same topic today. WD says, of course, that this is "to support this growth and ensure continued excellence," but of course, the company will benefit from the bump to its margins and thus, profits. 📈 Following SanDisk's 10% #NAND hike and Micron's week-long pricing freeze, #WesternDigital is joining the price-raise club! #HDDs across all capacities are set to go up, and ocean freight delays could stretch delivery by weeks—better plan your orders now!💡More:… pic.twitter.com/iFj1vCPW5ESeptember 15, 2025 It's "warm" data, information that needs to be available for ready access, but doesn't have to be as quick or responsive as the SSDs that serve as primary online storage for essentially all systems now. Because it isn't constantly being accessed, hard drives can fill this role in an economical fashion. While SSDs have made huge strides in price-per-gigabyte, hard disks are still typically four to five times cheaper by capacity. Generative AI, as a class of workload, implies tremendous demands for nearline storage. Obviously, generative AI can spew out an unlimited pile of output, but it's not just the AI models' output that is filling up servers' storage. The software infrastructure to both set up and run generative AI workloads is itself quite heavy: Training datasets, model checkpoints, inference logs, and more specialized fine-tuning datasets can all eat up petabytes of data in a shockingly short amount of time. Because the supply of hard drives is insufficient, cloud service providers (CSPs) and other hyperscalers might be looking at economical QLC SSDs for cold data storage. This has its benefits; performance is better, physical density can be improved, power consumption is typically lower, and most importantly, they're actually available to purchase. These should help bring costs down once they hit the market. But in the short term, we can expect the storage crunch to cause rising SSD prices as well, at least for enterprise drives. If you're keen on picking up some solid-state storage, it might not be a bad idea to start shopping now. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GeekWire first reported about the acquisition earlier this year. Now the founders are working at Apple in various AI-related roles, according to LinkedIn. Apple and WhyLabs execs haven't responded to our messages about the deal. The EU lists the deal as dated Jan. 24, noting that such acquisitions are typically published at least four months after notification. That suggests the WhyLabs acquisition came together in 2024. WhyLabs built software to help companies monitor their AI applications for security and performance. The company joins a growing list of Seattle tech startups gobbled up by Apple. The Cupertino tech giant previously paid $200 million in 2020 to acquire Xnor, a Seattle startup that specialized in edge-based AI tools. Apple has a substantial engineering hub in Seattle across multiple offices. Earlier this year it inked a big new lease in South Lake Union and currently has more than 200 open Seattle-based roles. Apple has been seen as lagging behind rivals in the AI race. The company is working on an AI-powered search system slated to debut next year, according to Bloomberg, and has reportedly explored acquiring AI heavyweights including Perplexity and Mistral. WhyLabs spun out of Seattle's Allen Institute for AI, the Seattle-based research institution that also housed Xnor. Investors included AI Fund; Defy Partners; Bezos Expeditions; Madrona; and Ascend. Visnjic previously spent eight years at Amazon helping develop its machine learning infrastructure. Dang and Gracie were also former Amazon employees. Karaivanova was a former Cloudflare executive and principal at Madrona. Have a scoop that you'd like GeekWire to cover?

Besides DDL changes, pgstream can also do on-the-fly data anonymization and data masking. It can stream to other stores, like Elasticsearch, but the current main focus is on PG to PG replication with DDL changes and anonymization.We've been using it in Xata to power  our `xata clone` functionality, which creates a "staging replica" on the Xata platform, with anonymized data that closely resembles production. Then one gets fast copy-on-write branching from this anonymized staging replica. This is great for creating dev branches and ephemeral environments.

This looks great by comparison from what I remember though.
