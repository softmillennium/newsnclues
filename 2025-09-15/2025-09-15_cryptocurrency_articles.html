                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SPECIAL REPORT: See The Most Trusted Financial Firms By Category This options move can capitalize on further weakness in Strategy stock. Investors piling into bitcoin play Strategy (MSTR) have faced disappointing results in recent months. This approach has effectively turned Strategy – previously called MicroStrategy – into a leveraged bet on bitcoin. Cofounder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has promoted this strategy as a once-in-a-lifetime play on "digital gold." Despite his often bold claims, critics have had little traction while bitcoin remains near record highs — with the cryptocurrency hitting an all-time peak of over 124,000 on Aug. 14. Yet despite bitcoin's strength, Strategy shares have significantly underperformed. The stock trades well below its late-November 2024 high of 543, hovering closer to 325 today. The products give investors alternative ways to gain exposure without paying a premium for Strategy shares. More recently, the growth of other bitcoin treasury companies has intensified competition, further diluting Strategy's unique appeal. As a result, the company's premium to net asset value, or NAV, of its bitcoin holdings has collapsed — sliding from over 300% to just above 40%. This put option currently costs around $17 per contract, equating to a maximum loss on the trade of $1,700, should shares remain above 320 on expiration. This trade will break even if Strategy stock trades at 303 on expiration. The key to a put option here is also muted volatility. While that is in line with recent realized volatility, it is well below the stock's historical annualized volatility, which has averaged around 80%. Shares of Strategy are currently trading below both their 50-day and 200-day lines. Steven Bell is a writer and trader based out of Vancouver, British Columbia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin is facing solid resistance at $117,500, but the possibility of a rally to $124,474 remains high as long as the price remains above the moving averages. Bitcoin is facing significant resistance at $117,500, but the bulls remain on top as long as the price stays above $113,400. Several altcoins are showing signs of profit booking in the near term, but lower levels are likely to attract buyers. Bitcoin's (BTC) failure to cross above the $117,500 resistance on Monday attracted profit booking by short-term buyers, who have pulled the price below $115,000. Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan said in a post on X that BTC has not topped out at $124,500 because of strong institutional demand, which is growing. Spot BTC exchange-traded funds recorded $642.35 million in inflows on Friday, according to SoSoValue data. That propelled the weekly inflows to $2.34 billion. The inflows were not limited to BTC ETFs alone. Ether (ETH) ETFs garnered $637.68 million in inflows last week. However, not everyone is buying BTC in this market. Lookonchain said in a post on X that a long-term BTC whale, who swapped $4 billion in BTC for ETH two weeks ago, has sent 1,176 BTC worth over $136 million into the trading platform Hyperliquid (HYPE) on Sunday, and has started dumping. Could BTC overcome its overhead resistance? Will select altcoins start a new up move? The index may then tumble to the breakout level of 6,147, which is likely to attract buyers. Sellers will try to strengthen their position by pulling the price below the 97.10 support. If they do that, the next stop could be the solid support at 96.37. Buyers are expected to defend the 96.37 level with all their might because a break below it may sink the index to the 95 level. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the moving averages. That suggests the selling pressure may be reducing. If they manage to do that, it suggests that the BTC/USDT pair may extend its stay inside the $107,000 to $124,474 range for a few more days. ETH turned down from the $4,788 to $4,956 resistance zone, indicating that the bears are active at higher levels. The ETH/USDT pair has reached the 20-day EMA ($4,438), which is a critical level to watch out for. XRP (XRP) turned down from $3.18 on Saturday and is retesting the breakout level from the descending triangle pattern. Buyers will then try to resume the up move by pushing the XRP/USDT pair above $3.20. If they do that, the XRP price could rally to $3.40 and subsequently to $3.66. Solana (SOL) turned down from $250 on Sunday, indicating that the bears are selling as the price nears the $260 overhead resistance. The SOL/USDT pair could dip to the 20-day EMA ($217), which is likely to attract buyers. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it signals demand at lower levels. Instead, if the price continues lower and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits in a hurry. BNB (BNB) has been in a strong uptrend for the past few days, indicating sustained demand from the bulls. Both moving averages are sloping up, and the RSI is in the positive territory, signaling that buyers are in control. The bulls will try to push the price to $1,000, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense. A short-term top will be signaled if the BNB/USDT pair turns down and plummets below the 50-day SMA ($841). Related: Solana confirms bullish signal that last time led to 1,300% SOL price gains The bears are trying to pull the price to the 20-day EMA ($0.24), which is a vital level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with force, it shows demand at lower levels. Cardano (ADA) has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision about the next directional move. If they can pull it off, the ADA/USDT pair could surge to $1.02. Sellers will try to halt the up move at $1.02, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could soar to $1.17 and then to $1.25. This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the support line. HYPE pulled back after hitting $57.44 on Friday, but the shallow correction suggests the bulls are not rushing to the exit. If they manage to do that, the HYPE/USDT pair could rally toward the pattern target of $64.25. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American Express shares climbed 0.81% to $327.95 as the company unveiled Ethereum-based digital travel stamps through its revamped app. These commemorative stamps mark cardholder journeys and function as valueless ERC-721 tokens stored on Coinbase's Base network. The product signals Amex's commitment to fusing traditional travel experiences with modern digital identity tools. American Express launched a new feature in its travel app that issues blockchain-based digital stamps to commemorate trips. The tokens are minted whenever a user books travel with their Amex card. The stamps hold no monetary value and cannot be traded or transferred on secondary markets. Instead, the tokens serve purely as digital mementos that showcase where users have traveled. Users can access, store, and view their stamps through this wallet without additional steps or blockchain know-how. Ethereum slipped 2.24% in trading, showing a contrast with Amex's integration of its blockchain infrastructure for product innovation. While ETH remains a cornerstone for many decentralized applications, its price faced typical volatility unrelated to Amex's specific project. The Base network offers scalability and low transaction fees, making it suitable for high-volume minting use cases like Amex's travel stamps. This approach allows American Express to avoid mainnet congestion while ensuring interoperability with the wider Ethereum ecosystem. Ethereum's long-term adoption outlook remains steady, although short-term price movements do not always reflect enterprise-level engagement. Projects like Amex's show that blockchain infrastructure continues to attract large firms for customer engagement tools. Coinbase shares rose 0.13% following news of Amex utilizing the company's Base network to support digital passport stamps. The collaboration highlights Coinbase's continued push into Web3 infrastructure by offering enterprise-grade solutions beyond traditional exchange services. It also positions Coinbase as a backend partner for major financial institutions. Base provides a developer-friendly environment for Layer 2 blockchain applications, reducing costs and boosting performance. This partnership validates Base's capacity to handle real-world, large-scale deployments. The ongoing enterprise adoption of Base could provide steady growth opportunities as Web2 and Web3 merge.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first exchange-traded fund (ETF) built around a meme coin could hit the market this week, after multiple delays and much speculation. The DOGE ETF — formally called the Rex Shares-Osprey Dogecoin ETF (DOJE) — was originally slated to debut last week, alongside a handful of politically themed and crypto-related ETFs. Now, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart believe Wednesday is the most likely launch date, though they caution nothing is certain. These include tokens like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu SHIB$0.0₄1301 and Bonk, which often surge in popularity thanks to internet culture, celebrity endorsements and speculative trading. Instead, the fund will use a Cayman Islands-based subsidiary to gain exposure through futures and other derivatives. This approach sidesteps the need for physical custody of the coin while still offering traders a way to bet on its performance within a traditional brokerage account. The ETF was approved earlier this month under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which is typically used for mutual funds and diversified ETFs. That sets it apart from the wave of bitcoin ETFs that received green lights under the Securities Act of 1933, a framework used for commodity-based and asset-backed products. Several firms have filed applications to launch spot DOGE ETFs, which would hold the meme coin itself rather than derivatives. These applications are still under review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has grown more comfortable with crypto ETFs since approving a slate of bitcoin products in early 2024. The broader crypto market has shown that investor demand can outweigh fundamental critiques. Meme coins have long drawn skepticism for having no underlying value or use case, but that hasn't kept them from drawing billions in speculative capital. He added that many existing financial products serve no deeper purpose than providing a vehicle for short-term bets. “So if there's an audience for this in the crypto world, I wouldn't be surprised at all if this finds an audience in the ETF and TradFi world.” Either way, it signals a new phase in the merging of internet culture and traditional finance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company's latest acquisition was funded entirely with proceeds from preferred shares. In recent weeks, however, the company's approach to funding has been varied. Last month, Strategy announced back-to-back Bitcoin purchases that weren't funded with proceeds from issuing common shares. Over the period, it bought 585 Bitcoin worth $67 million, with one week representing its lightest activity since late March. Bitcoin meanwhile changed hands around $115,000, a 0.4% decrease over the past day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. In a Myriad market, more than 80% of respondents believe that Bitcoin will trade above $105,000 throughout September. BTC last dipped below that level in June, although it has been buffeted by macroeconomic uncertainties more recently. (Disclosure: Myriad is a prediction market and engagement platform developed by Dastan, parent company of an editorially independent Decrypt.) So far this year, the company has unveiled four distinct types. Some can be converted into common shares, while others require Strategy to make regular dividend payments. And Strategy's stock hasn't traded at a 2.5x premium to its Bitcoin holdings since November. Some analysts believe that Strategy's self-imposed restriction compressed that premium, but in a Monday note, Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at investment bank Standard Chartered pointed to another potential factor: copycats. Solana Gets First Billion-Dollar Publicly Traded Treasury as Forward Industries Buys 6.8M SOL “We see market saturation as the main driver of recent [premium] compression,” he wrote, arguing that there are currently “too many imitators” in the Bitcoin treasury space. If fledgling firms that own Bitcoin become distressed, he said consolidation is a “strong possibility,” with Strategy poised to be among the most active buyers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite hosting the world's most valuable cryptocurrency, Bitcoin's (BTC) financial layer remains far behind the second-largest blockchain, Ethereum (ETH), which holds $64.6 billion in total value locked (TVL) compared to Bitcoin's $7.39Bn. The contrast underscores how much potential still lies dormant within BitcoinFi. Enterprise data platform Maestro released its “State of BitcoinFi” report last month, which highlights critical stats on the rise of BitcoinFi – essentially DeFi built on Bitcoin. While significant, that figure still trails Ethereum's scale massively and is only about half Solana's $14.37Bn. Stablecoins are also gaining ground in the Bitcoin ecosystem, with $860 million now locked. Growth is led by Avalon's USDa, a CDP-based stablecoin that allows users to lock BTC as collateral to mint USDa, and Hermetica's synthetic dollar, which is backed by Bitcoin reserves and hedging strategies. Another key insight is the rise of programmability, with $5.52 billion—around 52,000 BTC—now sitting in environments where it can be used in DeFi, lending, stablecoin issuance, token creation, and other smart contract applications. That figure underscores the institutional and developer push to make Bitcoin more than a static reserve asset. On the cultural front, the rise of BRC-20 tokens has proven that retail users are equally eager to experiment with Bitcoin programmability – even if through less efficient means. If anything has proven that users want more from Bitcoin, it's the rise of BRC-20 tokens. Yet it exploded in popularity, with daily volumes reaching as high as $128 million, according to the Maestro report, and meme tokens like ORDI and SATS fueling an entirely new market segment. Balances rely on off-chain indexers instead of native validation, making ownership ambiguous. Every transfer bloats Bitcoin's base chain, driving up fees and sparking controversy. And without smart contracts, the tokens themselves remain limited to speculation rather than powering lending, stablecoins, or complex applications. BRC-20 shows undeniable demand for tokens and programmability on Bitcoin, but it also exposes the limitations of building without a scalable foundation. Bitcoin Hyper is being built around a canonical bridge that allows BTC to flow directly into its Layer-2 environment. The model is somewhat similar to how users mint USDa on Avalon by locking Bitcoin as collateral, but in this case the wrapped asset is far more versatile. This design establishes a foundation that past projects couldn't achieve. Users benefit from parallelized execution, low fees, and confirmation speeds measured in sub-seconds, all while knowing their assets remain protected by Bitcoin's settlement guarantees. Instead of defaulting to the Ethereum Virtual Machine and its serial constraints, Hyper's work with SVM shows how parallel transaction processing can map onto Bitcoin settlement without breaking trust. This commitment to open development stands in sharp contrast to projects like Fractal Bitcoin and SatoshiVM, which promised innovation but never built secure, sustainable infrastructure. Hyper runs on Solana VM, mapping its parallel model to Bitcoin settlement—delivering faster dApps, validated flows, and stronger performance than EVM, with Solana's runtime + Bitcoin's security. Purchases can be made with SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or even a credit card. Bitcoin Hyper recommends Best Wallet, one of the best crypto wallets in the market, where HYPER is already listed under its highly accurate project screening tool, Upcoming Tokens.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor has announced the purchase of additional Bitcoin BTCUSD. The latest purchase, however, comes with a major twist. Saylor disclosed in an X post that Strategy has acquired 525 BTC, valued at approximately $60.2 million. Accordingly, Strategy has achieved a BTC yield of 25.9% year-to-date (YTD). Saylor added that the firm now holds a total of 638,985 BTC on its balance sheet. These coins were acquired for approximately $47.23 billion at about $73,913 per BTC. This recent BTC acquisition indicates that Strategy is still confident about the future price trajectory of the leading coin. Michael Saylor not giving up on Bitcoin This reduced BTC accumulation comes amid recent criticism of the firm. Rather, Calacanis advised investors to simply invest directly in Bitcoin. He argued that Saylor's aggressive BTC accumulation is actually damaging for the Bitcoin brand. As of 9/14/2025, we hodl 638,985 $BTC acquired for ~$47.23 billion at ~$73,913 per bitcoin. His comments come shortly after Strategy failed to make it on the flagship S&P 500 index, despite meeting various criteria. Despite these challenges, the recent BTC accumulation shows that Saylor is not giving up on Bitcoin.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tom Lee-chaired Ethereum treasury company BitMine Immersion reported its crypto and cash holdings had reached $10.8 billion on Monday. BitMine appears to have bought approximately 82,233 ETH ($370 million) since its last update on Sept. 8, broadly mirroring its reported acquisitions from onchain analysts last week. BitMine is currently the largest Ethereum treasury holder, followed by Joe Lubin's SharpLink and The Ether Machine, with approximately 837,230 ETH and 495,360 ETH, respectively, according to SER data. BitMine is also the second-largest public crypto treasury company overall, behind Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy, which holds bitcoin in the amount of 638,985 BTC ($73.5 billion). Supported by institutional investors including Ark Invest's Cathie Wood, Founders Fund, Bill Miller III, Pantera, Kraken, DCG, and Galaxy Digital, BitMine targets acquiring 5% of the circulating ETH supply, currently equivalent to around 6.04 million ETH. "BitMine has nearly $11 billion in total crypto holdings, surpassing the 2 million ETH milestone," Tom Lee said in a statement. "As we mentioned in our August Chairman's message, the convergence of both Wall Street moving onto the blockchain and AI/ agentic-AI creating a token economy is creating a supercycle for Ethereum. "We continue to believe Ethereum is one of the biggest macro trades over the next 10-15 years," Lee added. "Wall Street and AI moving onto the blockchain should lead to a greater transformation of today's financial system. And the majority of this is taking place on Ethereum." BMNR closed up 15.3% on Friday at $55.09, according to The Block's BitMine price page. It is down 1.8% in pre-market trading on Monday, per TradingView, having gained 572% year-to-date.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But for all its potential, a fundamental drawback has prevented widespread adoption by businesses: transparency often means a complete lack of privacy. The hard truth, however, is that for highly regulated industries like healthcare and finance, privacy isn't a nice-to-have; it's a legal and ethical requirement. Until blockchain can meet that standard, it will remain confined to pilot projects and niche applications. Privacy-enhancing technologies address a lot of the concerns around privacy in blockchain, but they often carry steep trade-offs in the form of high compute costs, slower performance, and complex integration.

Earn rewards worth up to 5,000 USDT on your first deposit Regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR mandate strict protection of patient data. Additionally, publishing operational or personal information to an immutable public ledger also conflicts with some privacy laws, especially GDPR's “right to be forgotten.” Even pseudonymised records can be deanonymised when cross-referenced with other datasets, exposing individuals or businesses to potential risk. Emerging technologies like zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), multiparty computation, and ring signatures can provide confidentiality, but they still face limitations in performance and ease of use. In finance, it could support secure trading, risk analysis, and compliance checks. In healthcare, it could also enable collaborative research without sharing any patient data. However, despite its promise, FHE remains far from widespread adoption. The computational power required is significant, and often slower than handling unencrypted data, making high-volume, real-time applications a challenge for enterprises. Standardized tools are also scarce, and integration usually requires specific cryptographic expertise. To solve the transparency problem in blockchain, advances in PETs efficiency and dedicated hardware for technologies like FHE will be essential. Standardization across the industry will play an equally critical role, providing common protocols and toolkits that make integration into existing systems and blockchain platforms far easier. Alongside these developments, deployment projects that demonstrate measurable returns while maintaining security and compliance will be key to proving its value and driving mass adoption across different industries. Blockchain must not force a choice between transparency and confidentiality. With innovative technologies like FHE, we could finally realise blockchain's full potential and create a resilient, decentralized infrastructure that safeguards even the most sensitive data.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stripe's head of crypto John Egan has jumped ship for Polygon Labs, less than a month after the payments giant announced its highly-anticipated Tempo blockchain. Egan joins the firm as its first chief product officer, where he will work directly under CEO Marc Boiron. In the new role he will advance Polygon's capacity as a stablecoin payments blockchain, helping increase adoption, scalability, and interoperability, according to information shared with DL News. It's not clear why Egan decided to leave Stripe just as the firm prepares to launch Tempo, which will compete with Polygon in the stablecoin payments sector. His move comes at a crucial time for the crypto industry. Stablecoins play a key role in those efforts after President Donald Trump signed the Genius Act into law in July and legitimised crypto tokens designed to trade at parity with the dollar after years of uncertainty. Not only are blockchain protocols like Hyperliquid working on their own stablecoins, but banking giants like Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo are also reportedly exploring launching their own stablecoins. Unveiled on September 4, it is a new blockchain specifically designed for stablecoin payments. It is incubated by Stripe and crypto venture firm Paradigm but will operate as a standalone company. Polygon was originally launched in 2020 as a way to scale the Ethereum blockchain. It initially soared in popularity but has since been eclipsed by other Ethereum-compatible blockchains, such as Arbitrum and Coinbase's Base. Before joining Stripe, Egan spent several years at Meta, formerly Facebook, and also founded multiple companies, including Caffeinated Mind, which was acquired by Facebook, blockchain art platform Editional, and incident management company Kintaba. “As we push Polygon to become the foundation for digital payments, we need someone who's proven they can bridge between what's technically possible and what users most need,” Marc Boiron, CEO of Polygon Labs, said in a statement. “John's that rare leader who's done it repeatedly,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ICO says students are behind more than half of all insider-led school data breaches that took place between 2022 and 2024. The good news is that it's mostly just about curiosity, dares, and rivalries more than anything else. ICO took a closer look at 215 school data breach reports and discovered that students caused 57% of the incidents. In a third of the cases, children simply guessed weak passwords or used login credentials that other people wrote down. In fact, students accounted for 97% of breaches that involved stolen login credentials. “Children are hacking into their schools' computer systems – and it may set them up for a life of cyber crime,” the ICO has stated in a press release. Students openly admit that they hack for dares, notoriety, financial gain, revenge, or rivalry. The report also revealed that staff mistakes were responsible for many breaches. The regulator told schools to refresh GDPR training, tighten access controls, and report breaches quickly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Functioning outside the bounds of traditional finance, recommended crypto exchanges enable greater autonomy and introduce novel avenues for decentralized asset trading. Let us explore a bit deeper how they operate and what sets them apart from their centralized counterparts. Crypto exchanges that operate on a peer-to-peer basis are fundamentally different from conventional trading platforms. Rather than relying on intermediaries to process trades, users deal directly with one another, and the platform's role is limited to providing transaction tools such as escrow systems, while offering a secure environment for deal execution. This structure enhances user control over funds and supports a wide range of payment options tailored to local preferences. The significance of recommended crypto exchanges in building a decentralized global financial system should not be underestimated. They extend cryptocurrency accessibility to underbanked regions, promote financial equality, and empower users worldwide. Recommended crypto exchanges continue to redefine what is possible in the world of digital trading. With innovation at their core and a full commitment to decentralization, these platforms are setting the modern tone for the future of crypto trading and investment opportunieties in a digitally connected world.
