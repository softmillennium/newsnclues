                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is not every day the record-holder for weeks at No. Novak Djokovic was in attendance with his son, Stefan, for the Davis Cup tie between home side Greece and Brazil. The 100-time tour-level titlist watched Joao Fonseca seal Brazil's victory against Stefanos Tsitsipas. Tsitsipas led Fonseca 5-3 in the deciding set and had an opportunity to serve for the match, which would have led to a deciding fifth rubber. It was the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. Fonseca had already defeated Stefanos Sakellaridis 7-5, 6-3 to begin the tie, and Tsitsipas had eased past Thiago Seyboth Wild 6-2, 6-1. Rafael Matos and Marcelo Melo put Fonseca in position to close out the tie with a 6-2, 6-2 victory against Aristotelis Thanos and Petros Tsitsipas.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jessica Pegula's back was spasming up during her US Open quarterfinal match against Barbora Krejcikova, so she took an uncharacteristic bathroom break and did some emergency crunches on the bathroom floor. Even if that means doing emergency crunches on a bathroom floor. 7 Jessica Pegula did halfway through her quarterfinal win over Barbora Krejcikova at the US Open. As she explained on The Player's Box podcast -- which she hosts alongside Madison Keys, Jennifer Brady and Desirae Krawczyk -- Pegula has been dealing with sacroiliac joint issues since Wimbledon, and it cropped up when she was up 4-3 in the first set. After closing it out 6-3, the 31-year-old took a bathroom break -- which she never does -- threw some towels on the bathroom floor in Arthur Ashe Stadium and began knocking out crunches and core exercises to unlock her back. "I needed to lay down on the floor and do some core exercises because my back was spasming up," Pegula explained. So I did core and glute activation stuff." Pegula gave eventual champion Aryna Sabalenka a run for her money in the semis, taking the first set, but lost the next two in what was still a highly productive fortnight in New York. She'll then play the WTA 1000 China Open, in Beijing, next week, and is scheduled to play the Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open in October.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jakub Mensik's booming first serve has been the cornerstone of his rapid rise, and during his breakthrough run in Miami, ATP Tennis IQ powered by PIF helped elevate it to a new level. The #NextGenATP Czech slammed 59 aces in his opening three matches at the ATP Masters 1000 event, yet he still looked for ways to gain an extra edge as he chased his first ATP Tour title. Watch Jakub Mensik explain how he uses ATP Tennis IQ powered by PIF “This year in Miami, ATP Tennis IQ was very important, because throughout the tournament I had been changing a lot of tactics,” Mensik explained. “In Miami, the surface is super fast, and I had been winning a lot of percentages. ATP Tennis IQ is an enhanced performance-analytics platform that delivers richer match data, advanced scouting, video breakdowns, and wearable integration, all in real-time. For Mensik, another key tool has been the ability to compare his own numbers with Tour averages, a feature that he believes has been vital in his rise to a career-high No. “ATP Tennis IQ powered by PIF is a must for every pro,” said Mensik. “It can help me break into the higher rankings by seeing my reports.

He is currently 11th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, 660 points shy of the qualification spots. Rublev is the top seed in Hangzhou, where he will first face Aleksandar Kovacevic or Luca Nardi. 2) Medvedev Seeks Turnaround: The former World No. He will seek a quick response in Hangzhou, where he is bidding to win his 21st tour-level title. Medvedev could face another former Top 10 star and the defending Hangzhou champion, Marin Cilic, in his opening match. 3) Home Star Zhang Returns: Zhang Zhizhen competes for the first time since Indian Wells in March as a wild card in Hangzhou. He takes on his countryman Buyunchaokete in the first rond.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After an action-packed day in Guadalajara, three first-time WTA semifinalists emerged: Iva Jovic, Elsa Jacquemot and Nikola Bartunkova, who capped the night with a straight sets win over defending champion Magdalena Frech. Ahead of quarterfinal day in Guadalajara, several rising stars were eyeing a breakthrough into their first WTA semifinal. Among them was 19-year-old Nikola Bartunkova, who faced a stiff test against defending champion Magdalena Frech. Instead, Bartunkova dispatched Frech in straight sets with poise and precision. She overcame an early break in the opening set and never looked back, sealing a 7-5, 6-4 victory in 1 hour and 38 minutes. With the win, Bartunkova advances to her first WTA semifinal -- coming in her first WTA-level tournament in nearly two years. It also marks the first top 30 victory of her career. She broke serve twice to stay alive in the third set, then saved a match point in a tense third-set tiebreak to clinch a spot in the next round. “I'm still shaking,” Jovic said after the match. But I never expected to get so much support here in Guadalajara. With the win, Jovic improves to 11-3 in three-set matches across all levels this season. “Muchísimas gracias por venir a apoyarme,” Jovic said. Earlier in the day, fans at Akron Stadium were treated to another thrilling battle, as Elsa Jacquemot outlasted veteran Tatjana Maria to reach her first WTA-level semifinal. Elsewhere, Emiliana Arango continued her stellar run in Guadalajara, defeating Marina Stakusic 6-2, 6-3 in just 72 minutes to reach the semifinals without dropping a set. It's Arango's second WTA 500 semifinal of the season -- both coming in Mexico, nearly seven months apart. Why does Arango play such good tennis in Mexico? “I have no idea,” Arango said after the match. “But I need more tournaments here in Mexico. I want all the tournaments to be here in Mexico so I can have all the people with me.” Now, as the only player left in the draw with experience this deep into a WTA-level tournament, she'll be looking for a better result this time around. After an action-packed day in Guadalajara, three first-time WTA semifinalists emerged: Iva Jovic, Elsa Jacquemot and Nikola Bartunkova, who capped the night with a straight sets win over defending champion Magdalena Frech.</p>
