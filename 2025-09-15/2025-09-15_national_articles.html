                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? A long-simmering showdown over whether President Donald Trump may seize control over the Federal Reserve appears to be entering its endgame. It is highly likely that the Supreme Court will weigh in on this dispute either Monday evening or Tuesday. The Supreme Court's Republican majority, however, subscribes to a theory known as the “unitary executive,” which claims that it is unconstitutional for Congress to shield agency leaders from presidential control. So any agency leader who wields authority that the Court deems to be “executive” in nature must be fireable at will by the president. And they kicked this process into overdrive shortly after Trump took office for his second term. When the Fed lowers interest rates, it makes it easier for businesses to borrow money that they can use to begin new projects and hire new workers. In advance of his reelection bid in 1972, President Richard Nixon successfully pressured Fed chair Arthur Burns to lower interest rates. The economy boomed that year as a result, and Nixon won in an historic landslide. But Burns's capitulation is often blamed for years of “stagflation,” slow economic growth and high inflation, during the 1970s. In any event, a lawsuit known as Cook v. Trump is now barreling toward the Supreme Court, and is likely to land on the justices' doorstep as soon as Monday night. Trump has asked the courts to weigh in on this case on an exceedingly expedited basis, in the hopes that he can gain the power to fire Federal Reserve governors in advance of an important Fed meeting that begins Tuesday. As of this writing, Cook is pending before a federal appeals court. Trump asked that court to issue its decision “by the close of business on Monday, September 15, 2025.” If the appeals court does not comply, however, Trump will almost certainly attempt to bypass it and seek review from the Supreme Court in advance of the Tuesday Fed meeting. So we are likely to find out very soon if the Court's Republican majority intends to place the Fed under Trump's control. Last month, Trump attempted to fire Lisa Cook, a member of the Fed's Board of Governors who was appointed by President Joe Biden in 2022. Trump claims he fired her because she allegedly committed mortgage fraud by claiming two separate properties as her principal residence — and thus he is firing her “for cause” — but this claim is an obvious pretext. Trump has raised similar allegations against several of his political foes, including Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James. And, in any event, the allegation against Cook was later revealed to be false. Last week, Reuters reported that Cook declared one of the two properties as a “vacation home,” so the lender that helped her purchase that property was aware it was not her principal residence. Nevertheless, Trump claims that he is allowed to fire Cook anyway. In briefs filed in a federal appeals court, Trump's lawyers argue that the president's false determination that Cook committed mortgage fraud “is not subject to judicial second-guessing,” and thus no court can prevent Trump from firing her based even on a transparently made-up pretext. Under Trump's legal theory, he could have justified firing Cook “for cause” by accusing her of being responsible for the 1881 assassination of President James Garfield, or for causing the fall of Rome. Trump is asking the Court to neutralize the law protecting Fed governors from political firings in its entirety. What stands in Trump's way is the Court's decision last May in Wilcox, which indicated that the Fed is exempt from the unitary executive theory, and that Trump may not fire its leaders at will. This Court frequently hands down bizarre or incomprehensible decisions, and those decisions are no less binding than cases that rest on sound legal reasoning. The important thing is that, just four months ago, this Court handed down a decision indicating that Trump cannot fire members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. If the Republican justices reverse course after such a recent decision, either by overruling Wilcox explicitly or by defining the term “for cause” so narrowly that it becomes meaningless, that wouldn't just have stunning implications for the US economy. It would also be an unusually loud signal that this Court has decided to become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Trump Organization.

We can hold two thoughts in our head at the same time. There's one big guardrail left on Trump's ambitions. Democrats are gearing up for a showdown that could destroy it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Assassination roils DC: Vice President JD Vance hosted the “Charlie Kirk Show” podcast today as last week's political assassination continues to roil the country. His interview with Fox was highly unusual, as FBI officials and Justice Department prosecutors generally avoid giving investigative details in a case that will be prosecuted. A series of messages sent by Robinson to a small group of people show him saying he had “bad news,” and that it was “me at UVU yesterday,” the Post said, citing sources and screenshots the Post viewed. CNN has reached out to law enforcement about Discord chats in the case, as well as the Utah Department of Public Safety for comment. Vice President JD Vance blamed Charlie Kirk's death on “a growing and powerful minority on the far left,” in his concluding remarks while hosting “The Charlie Kirk Show” today. “We can thank God that most Democrats don't share these attitudes, and I do, while acknowledging that something has gone very wrong with a lunatic fringe, a minority, but a growing and powerful minority on the far left,” Vance said on the show. Vance added that there could be “no unity” with the people who “celebrate Charlie Kirk's assassination” or “people who scream at children over their parents' politics.” He was referencing a time he went to Disneyland with his kids, when he said multiple people yelled offensive things at his family. “There was a loud and very vocal minority that would shout at my children, who were eight, five and three, whenever they got the opportunity. Certainly,” Vance concluded, claiming it was a “statistical fact” that “most of the lunatics in American politics today are proud members of the far left.” Vance's comments echo recent remarks by President Donald Trump and others within the administration. Speaking to NBC News on Saturday, Trump said he wants the nation to “heal,” but added, “We're dealing with a radical left group of lunatics, and they don't play fair and they never did.” Utah Democrats have received threatening calls and messages since Charlie Kirk was killed last week, Democratic state Rep. Angela Romero told CNN's Pamela Brown and Wolf Blitzer, calling it “a real eye-opener” to be blamed for Kirk's death. Romero, the Democratic leader in the state House, said that one person called “almost every Democrat,” calling them names and telling them to “leave the state,” with a tone that she described as “really frightening.” Asked by Blitzer whether state lawmakers are considering any bills in response to the fatal shooting, Romero said that “those are conversations we're going to have.” She and Utah Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla are also weighing an appropriation request related to safety and security funding, Romero said. “A lot more information” is expected to be released tomorrow once the state files charges against the suspect accused of killing Charlie Kirk, the Utah Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason told CNN's Boris Sanchez. “I do believe a lot more information tomorrow after those charges are filed will be able to speak to more of the intricacies of this investigation,” Mason said. He said investigators believe Robinson “acted alone” as the shooter. “What I can speak to is we are still conducting follow-up interviews and a lot of investigative leads to determine any relationship that may have played into this, whether that be political or personal,” he said. Mason's decision not to offer further details on the evidence is a contrast to that of FBI Director Kash Patel, who provided intimate details on the case in an interview with Fox News this morning. But an agreement makes it more likely the two men sit down when Trump visits Asia at the end of October, according to those officials. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said today the White House will be going after leftist “terror” networks who organize doxxing campaigns after the killing of Charlie Kirk. It is a vast domestic terror movement,” Miller told Vice President JD Vance, who was guest hosting an episode of “The Charlie Kirk Show.” He vowed to “use every resource we have at the Department of Justice, Homeland Security, and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle, and destroy these networks and make America safe again for the American people.” He added they would do it “in Charlie's name.” Vance had numerous guests on the show to talk about Kirk's assassination last week. The framework agreed upon includes “resolving TikTok-related issues through cooperation, reducing investment barriers, and promoting relevant economic and trade cooperation,” Li said at a news conference in Madrid, according to Chinese state media. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said President Donald Trump will speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping Friday to finalize the deal. Lawyers for Jeffrey Epstein's estate provided a second production of documents to the House Oversight Committee on Friday, according to a letter obtained by CNN. The document production included two more pages from Epstein's so-called birthday book – a collection of letters gifted to the late convicted sex offender for his 50th birthday – that were redacted in the first production earlier this month. Kolvet said they discussed additional protective measures but ultimately held back because Kirk “loved interacting with” the community. He said Kirk wanted to be as close to his supporters as possible, shaking hands and tossing hats into the crowd. As Kirk mobilized young conservatives on college campuses, he faced numerous personal threats in recent years. And his stops on campus tours were often met with impassioned protests that sometimes spiraled into chaos and violence, leading some schools to adopt strict security measures around his appearances. As authorities continue investigating Kirk's fatal shooting at his campus visit in Utah on Wednesday — the first on another nationwide tour of colleges — they have not yet said whether he faced any specific, recent threats before the event. CNN's Curt Devine, Rob Kuznia and Dalia Faheid contributed to this report. “We should not be giving visas to people who are going to come to the United States and do things like celebrate the murder, the execution, the assassination of a political figure,” Rubio said in an interview with Fox News today.“And if they're already here, we should be revoking their visa. Why would we want to bring people into our country they're going to engage in negative and destructive behavior?” he continued. The State Department has not responded to questions on whether any visas have actually been revoked or how many officials are working on this initiative. The agency has said free speech is a priority. In a post last week, Deputy Secretary of State Chris Landau said he had directed consular officers, who are involved in adjudicating visas, “to undertake appropriate action” against people “praising, rationalizing, or making light of” Kirk's death. The suspect in last week's killing of Charlie Kirk wrote that he had the “opportunity to take out” the conservative influencer, and “I'm going to take it,” FBI Director Kash Patel said today. The message was written prior to Wednesday's shooting, Patel told Fox News. It's unclear which form the message took; Patel described it as both a “note” and a “text message exchange.” He said the writing had since been “destroyed” but was recovered by investigators. Patel's interview with Fox is highly unusual, as FBI officials and Justice Department prosecutors generally avoid giving investigative details in a case that will be prosecuted for fear that it could damage the case. Robinson's family, Patel said, told investigators that Robinson had “subscribed to left-wing ideology.” Patel did not provide specifics on what that ideology included. Bureau employees previously told CNN they were frustrated with how Patel led the investigation. Qatari and US  officials had “serious discussions” about the two countries' bilateral security and defense partnership after Israel targeted Hamas officials in an airstrike in Doha last week, a diplomat with knowledge of the discussions told CNN. Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani visited the White House and had dinner with US President Donald Trump on Friday, three days after the Israeli strike. Trump has said publicly that he was “very unhappy about every aspect” of the Israeli attack. The diplomat said that Gulf Arab nations are in advanced discussions to solidify their collective military defense. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will visit the Qatari capital Doha tomorrow following a visit to Israel, the diplomat told CNN earlier. We will keep you posted on the latest headlines. If you're just joining us, we're covering political developments in Washington, DC and beyond. Meanwhile, FBI Director Kash Patel provided new details about a note written by the suspect in Kirk's assassination. The White House has also requested an additional $58 million in security funding for the executive and judicial branches Kirk's assassination, a Republican aide said. Israeli sources told CNN before the meeting that the Netanyahu was expected to raise his government's potential West Bank annexation plans. Rubio's visit comes after Israel's strike in Doha last week. Nuclear power deal with UK: The US and UK governments will sign an agreement this week ushering in new deals on nuclear power between companies in the two countries. You can read more details here about what to expect. TikTok deal: A deal has been reached between the Trump administration and China to keep TikTok operational in the United States, US administration officials said, concluding a yearslong effort that began during President Donald Trump's first term. The US president said he would be speaking to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Friday. Ukraine-Russia: Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there has been no progress toward setting up a trilateral summit with Ukraine and the United States. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there has been no progress toward setting up a trilateral summit with Ukraine and the United States. US President Donald Trump had raised that prospect after his Alaska summit last month with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin has since insisted on several conditions for such a meeting. Asked about Trump's remarks on Friday that his patience with Putin was wearing thin, Peskov said that the Kremlin had “heard these statements,” and Russia remained ready to resolve the crisis by political and diplomatic means. President Donald Trump suggested that a deal has been reached with China to keep TikTok operational in the United States, the conclusion of a yearslong effort that began during Trump's first term. It will be concluding shortly,” Trump posted on Truth Social. I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday.” More on TikTok talks: Chinese and US diplomats have been meeting this week in Spain, to discuss trade and other matters. A bipartisan bill passed by Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden banned TikTok in the United States unless its China-based owner divested its stake in the US assets of the social media company. The deadline had most recently been extended to Wednesday. The killing of Charlie Kirk is an attempt to silence those who want to openly engage in debate with those with opposing views, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said today while in Israel. The secretary of state said that he believes the assassination was not only an effort to silence Kirk but also to intimidate others who wanted to engage in open dialogue with those with opposing viewpoints. The US and UK governments will sign an agreement this week ushering in new deals on nuclear power between companies in the two countries. Among other things, the accord will make it easier to build new nuclear power stations in both countries – for example, by reducing the time it takes for a nuclear project to get a license from roughly three or four years to about two, the UK government said in a statement today. It is also in line with moves by the US administration earlier this year to boost nuclear energy, which include measures to speed up reactor testing and expand the enrichment of uranium. Nuclear power, generally, doesn't emit planet-warming pollution when generated or used. However, one problem is storing radioactive waste, which can remain dangerous for thousands of years. The graphic nature of Kirk's killing, which could be witnessed by anyone with a cellphone, and the conservative activist's youth, political power and proximity to President Donald Trump may enshrine it as a searing collective moment in modern US history. Its potential to galvanize profound reactions is more potent because it took place in a nation racked by its most venomous divides in decades, where every political win or loss can seem existential, and under an administration that often shows a desire to wield almost unlimited power. This is a significant impediment for those political leaders who genuinely want to cool tempers. And no wonder lawmakers and opinion formers are reconsidering their exposure to the public following Kirk's killing in a hunkering-down that could further constrain American democracy. Trump has not chosen the traditional presidential route of invoking calm at perilous political moments. He's ominously blaming his opponents collectively for a spate of worsening political violence that has spilled blood on both sides. One fear is that the assassination of Kirk, who took Trump's MAGA movement to a younger generation of voters, will provoke more violence or reprisals against other political leaders, or will stifle open public debate. On Sunday, House Speaker Mike Johnson said leadership is looking at “all options” to bolster member security.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Speaking at a joint news conference in Jerusalem, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked the United States for their support and pledged to defeat Hamas so it no longer poses a threat to Israel. The U.S. has sought to ease tensions between Israel and Qatar, two close American allies. Netanyahu and Rubio stood shoulder-to-shoulder in Jerusalem and downplayed the furor that had, at least for a short time, taken the Trump administration aback. There were no signs of U.S. frustration or annoyance with Israel's latest moves, although President Donald Trump had made clear his displeasure with Israel's unilateral strike on Hamas in Qatar. While speaking at a summit over Israel's attack last week, Qatar's ruling emir accused Israel of not caring about its hostages held in the Gaza Strip and instead only working to “ensure Gaza is no longer livable.” Comey sued the U.S. government on Monday over her abrupt July dismissal, saying it came without cause or notice and was unconstitutional. The lawsuit was filed in Manhattan federal court, where Comey had earned praise for her handling of major complex prosecutions, particularly in sexual abuse cases. Comey, whose father is former FBI Director James Comey, became a rising star in her office for her work on the case against financier Jeffrey Epstein and his onetime girlfriend, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell and the recent trial of music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs. “With God as my witness, we're going to use every resource we have at the Department of Justice, Homeland Security and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks,” Miller said. Vance used similar rhetoric in his own remarks, saying “we're going to go after the NGO network that foments, facilitates and engages in violence.” Law enforcement officials have said they believe the suspect accused of killing Kirk acted alone. The funding, if approved, would be available through September 2027. During a conversation with Kirk's widow, Vance said she told him that Kirk never raised his voice” and “was never cross or mean-spirited to her.” Vance said he would aspire to that in his own life. Vance described Kirk as “a joyful warrior for our country.” “None of us knows when our time will come.” She appeared at many events with Kirk and recalled him as an “incredibly kind” person. “Charlie was one of the first people that I spoke to,” Gabbard said. Following a two-day trade talk in Madrid, Li Chenggang, China's international trade representative, said China and the United States have reached “basic framework consensus” to solve TikTok-related issues in a cooperative way, reduce investment barriers and promote related economic and trade cooperation, according to China's official news agency Xinhua. FILE - The TikTok logo is displayed on a smartphone screen, Sept. 28, 2020, in Tokyo, Japan. The European Union is looking into whether TikTok has broken the bloc's strict new digital rules for cleaning up social media and keeping internet users safe. Li said the two sides had “candid, in-depth” discussions over TikTok and matters of concern to China during this trade talk. Details of the agreement are unknown, but Li said China would never seek any deal at the cost of principle, stance, business interests or global fairness and justice. FBI Director Kash Patel will appear before Oversight committees Tuesday and Wednesday as he faces scrutiny over his leadership of the Charlie Kirk investigation and other areas. House Speaker Mike Johnson will lead the memorial service Monday evening. Well-wishers pay their respects at a makeshift memorial at the national headquarters of Turning Point USA after the shooting death of Charlie Kirk, CEO of the organization, during a Utah college event Wednesday, Sept. 10, 2025, in Phoenix. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told House Democrats — as well as their spouses and families — on a weekend conference call that he's spoken to Speaker Mike Johnson about security measures for lawmakers. They are discussing extending the enhanced security measures and funding that were put in place following the attacks on Minnesota lawmakers earlier this year. And Senate Majority Leader John Thune has invited security officials to brief senators at their private lunch Tuesday. Trump suggested Mayor Muriel Bowser's decision could allow crime to proliferate in the city, which he said he wouldn't let happen. “I'll call a National Emergency, and Federalize, if necessary!! Trump's emergency order for the nation's capital, which federalized the police force and launched a law enforcement surge, expired on Sept. 11 after Congress did not renew it. Bowser said the city would continue to cooperate with federal law enforcement agencies after the order expires but ruled out cooperation with ICE. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said securities regulators should stop requiring companies to issue financial reports every three months and instead switch to a six-month reporting period. The Securities and Exchange Commission has required publicly traded companies to report on a quarterly basis since 1970. “This will save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies,” Trump wrote. The San Francisco-based exchange lists companies focused on long-term goals. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio gestures at a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (not pictured) at the Prime Minister's Office, during his visit, in Jerusalem, Monday, Sept. 15, 2025. The U.S. has sought to ease tensions between Israel and Qatar, two close American allies. Israel and the United States showed a unified front Monday in the face of growing international anger over Israel's airstrikes on Hamas leaders on Qatar and its intensifying bombardment of Gaza City. As Arab and Muslim leaders met in Doha to condemn Israel's attack last week in Qatar and new rounds of criticism were aired over Israeli plans to occupy Gaza City, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Rubio stood shoulder-to-shoulder in Jerusalem and downplayed the furor that had, at least for a short time, taken the Trump administration aback. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu takes a question from the media next to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio at their joint press conference at the Prime Minister's Office, during Rubio's visit, in Jerusalem, Monday, Sept. 15, 2025. There were no signs of U.S. frustration or annoyance with Israel's latest moves, although President Trump had made clear his displeasure with Israel's unilateral strike on Hamas in Qatar, which is a close U.S. partner. And the military honor guard is drilling to ensure every step lands with precision. Throughout the halls and grounds of the almost 1,000-year-old castle west of London, hundreds of people are working to make sure King Charles III puts on the best show possible when he welcomes President Trump for his historic second state visit this week. The visit, featuring glittering tiaras, brass bands and a sumptuous banquet served on 200-year-old silver, is a display of the pomp and ceremony that Britain does like no one else. Trump posted on his social media site that a meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials went well and that a deal was reached regarding “a ‘certain' company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save.” His comment suggested the company is TikTok, the social media company associated with China that U.S. law requires to be sold or else cease operations. Trump credits TikTok with helping him to win the 2024 presidential election. The rule, which started last season and was made permanent for this one, places the opposing teams closer together, among other changes. Trump wrote on Truth Social that it's “ridiculous looking.” Trump has made sporting events an integral part of his presidency — he attended a Yankees baseball game last week — and often views them as another arena for fighting “woke” politics. For example, he threatened to block a new stadium for the Washington Commanders if they don't restore the name Redskins, which was considered offensive to Native Americans. The vice president was close to the assassinated conservative activist, and on Monday he'll serve as a substitute host for his talk show.

Travis Kelce's frustrations boiled over on Sunday as the Kansas City Chiefs fell to the Philadelphia Eagles in a rematch of Super Bowl LIX. The Kansas City Chiefs tight end was seen on the FOX broadcast telling his teammates in the second quarter that he was "sick of this s---" and slammed his helmet down on the field. The clip came after Patrick Mahomes scored on a rushing touchdown. Philadelphia Eagles safety Andrew Mukuba (24) intercepts a pass intended for Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce (87) during the fourth quarter of the game at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on Sept. 14, 2025. The star tight end then suffered a crucial drop that led to an Eagles interception and, eventually, a touchdown on the next drive for the Jalen Hurts-led squad. The ball was just to the right of Kelce and he was unable to make a play. The ball bounced out of his hands and into the hands of Eagles defender Andrew Mukuba. Philadelphia took a 10-point lead and won the game 20-17. Kelce had four catches for 61 yards, leading the team. Chiefs head coach Andy Reid talked about Kelce's emotions on the sidelines. Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce (87) celebrates after a play against the Philadelphia Eagles during the second quarter of the game at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on Sept. 14, 2025. "He's trying to get guys fired up and going. He's that way every week if you keep an eye on him. That's the way he was today," Reid said. We expect them to play that zero-zero with the hole player – with the safety," he said. "I think I threw it just a tad too early, just trying to put it on his (Kelce's) body low before that hole player got there and I think if I can put it more on his body and not so far out in front of him then he can catch it, take the hit and get in the end zone." We played two good football teams and made mistakes in big moments - stuff that we're not used to doing," Mahomes said. "But I think we're coming together as a team, man. I mean, when you deal with adversity it's about how you deal with it and obviously, this isn't how we wanted to start. But how are we going to respond? Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce heads off the field following an NFL football game against the Philadelphia Eagles Sunday, Sept. 14, 2025, in Kansas City, Missouri. "So, I'm excited for the next few weeks to see who wants to be challenged and how we can get back and really get after it."

Fox News correspondent Christina Coleman reports on the upcoming memorial service for Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk and the outpouring of support his family has received since his assassination on 'Fox News Live.' A small business in Idaho is receiving backlash for paying tribute to Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. Grooveberries Frozen Yogurt in Coeur d'Alene has been placing stickers with a photo of the conservative activist on its red cups, with "1993-2025" shown beneath his name. Sarah and Chase Gibson, owners of Grooveberries and the parents of three children, told Fox News Digital they have received death threats for honoring Kirk's legacy. Even someone saying we should be dead," said Sarah Gibson. A main reason for the outpouring of community support they've received, she said, is likely due to the initial hate that came their way. An Idaho frozen yogurt business has received overwhelming community support for placing Charlie Kirk memorial stickers on its cups. "I love how supportive our community is," said Sarah Gibson. Grooveberries has received direct emails to the shop and a slew of hateful reviews on Facebook. As shared with Fox News Digital, one email said, "You guys are sick. … The man is dead, thank God for that, you guys should be dead for what you're doing, selling products [about] a piece of s--- person." "Better not make a black and white Charlie Kirk recipe," said another message, in part. One Facebook review called the shop owners "White supremacists," telling other people not to give them their money. Grooveberries Frozen Yogurt in Idaho is facing death threats after placing memorial stickers honoring Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk on cups. "I don't like fascism mixed in my yogurt," posted one user. "People need to know that this is how [those on] the Left choose to handle people they don't agree with," said Gibson. Grooveberries Frozen Yogurt has been receiving an array of negative messages. Gibson added that the backlash they've received has been a big reason their community has become even more emboldened to take a stand. "Charlie Kirk died a martyr for his faith in Jesus Christ," she told Fox News Digital on Sunday. "He spoke the truth even when it was hard. Sarah Gibson said Kirk's legacy needs to be honored and his messages continued. Stephanie Hamill, a political commentator, told Fox News Digital the number of people celebrating Kirk's death has shaken her to her core. "That's why it was so refreshing to see even small gestures of kindness — like a tribute cup honoring Charlie Kirk's life in my own community," she said. "When I stopped in for frozen yogurt with my family on Saturday night, I was pleasantly surprised to see those cups sitting on the counter." "Charlie Kirk died a martyr for his faith in Jesus Christ," said the co-owner of a store that is honoring him with special commemorative cups. She said Grooveberries is her favorite frozen yogurt shop. "His life was taken from him in one of the most horrific and public ways imaginable, and honoring his memory should never be controversial." Sarah Gibson said she's already placed another "huge order" of Kirk stickers and wants to continue making the cups available for as long as consumers demand them. The shop has been tracking all sales and plans to send funds to Charlie Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, for a "blueberry budget," referencing what Mrs. Kirk said in her public statement after her husband's assassination.

Josh Wiitala and his crews revealed how seven bombers carried out the first combat use of America's 30,000-pound bunker busters on Iran's nuclear sites. KNOB NOSTER, MO – Details from the longest large-scale B-2 bombing mission in history are only now coming into focus, as Fox News Digital gained rare access to Whiteman Air Force Base and the commanders who led Operation Midnight Hammer, striking Iran. In interviews on base, Col. Josh Wiitala and his crews described how 4,000 personnel worked in secrecy to send seven stealth bombers on a 30-hour mission into Iranian airspace — the first time America's 30,000-pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator was used in combat. They called the raid a flawless performance and offered vivid accounts of the strain, training and coordination required to pull it off. "We have a low observable culture — everybody's working in secrecy to carry out the mission," Wiitala told Fox News Digital, speaking publicly for the first time since the June strikes. A B-2 bomber is seen at Whiteman Air Force Base on Sept. 8, 2025. In deciding who went, Wiitala said he prioritized experience over everything else. "This team had flown Red Flag after Red Flag, major exercise after major exercise," he said. "I was watching the crews prepare, I was just thinking about how many repetitions they'd had, how long they'd trained for this. And it was a very seasoned crew." The colonel would not discuss specifics such as how much notice the crew was given, whether electronic warfare or other countermeasures were used, or measurable evidence for why commanders believed the bombs hit their intended targets. Those details remain classified, leaving outsiders to rely on satellite imagery and independent assessments for verification. "What I told them is, ‘I think this will be remembered as one of the most consequential raids of our lifetime.' Pilots came home from the 30-hour mission "completely exhausted," according to Wiitala — it was the longest mission for a large-scale bombing attack with seven planes. Each aircraft had two pilots, and they took turns resting for 45 minutes to an hour at a time, particularly in between complex aerial refuelings. Some carted cases of energy drinks on board to stay alert. The longest combat mission for any airplane was 44.3 hours, when pilots struck al Qaeda and Taliban targets after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Rest periods consist of trying to get horizontal on the small patch of metal floor behind the pilot's seats. Col. Josh Wiitala speaks about piloting the B-2 stealth bomber during a Fox News Digital visit to Whiteman Air Force Base on Sept. 8, 2028. A B-2 stealth bomber on display at Whiteman Air Force Base, Sept. 8, 2025. The aerial refueling, according to Wiitala, "is the hardest stick and rudder, hand-flying piece of what we do." The B-2 must fly parallel below the KC tanker for 15–30 minutes to take on a fuel load of up to 167,000 pounds. In terms of mission success, it was 14 weapons on target. So I was incredibly proud of how they executed, incredibly proud of the whole, you know, all 4,000 people here across our hundreds of specialties supporting this mission and making it work." But the $2 billion plane is aging: 20 of them have been in operation for close to 30 years. Combined with rapidly evolving air defenses — drone swarms, long-range surface-to-air missiles and sensors — the B-2 was built for an earlier generation of air combat. Head-on view of a B-2 stealth bomber at Whiteman Air Force Base on Sept. 8, 2025. A B-2 bomber seen during the Fox News Digital visit to Whiteman Air Force Base, Sept. 8, 2025. The B-21 is expected to be more cost-effective, under $1 billion per plane, and the Air Force plans to buy 175–200 of them. The MOPs are stored on base along with 500-pound and 2,000-pound bombs. They are maintained to be ready for use at a moment's notice. Weapons loaders train for 21 days to become certified in maintaining and loading the 30,000-pound bombs, which lock into the body of the plane at two steel touchpoints, according to Chief Master Sgt. Frank Espinoza, 509th Maintenance Group wing weapons manager. The finalized version has now been tested for "several years," according to Espinoza. Maintenance chief Frank Espinoza explains how the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, or bunker buster bomb, is kept combat-ready. A 30,000-pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator on display at Whiteman Air Force Base, Sept. 8, 2025. The bombs were dropped on targets across two Iranian nuclear facilities: 12 MOPs were dropped on the Fordow uranium enrichment plant, buried under 300 feet of rock, and two on the Natanz nuclear facility. Israeli airstrikes took out Iran's air defenses, creating a ripe opportunity for U.S. bombers to enter Iranian airspace at relatively lower risk. A recent assessment from nuclear weapons expert David Albright and a team of researchers analyzing data from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found that after U.S. strikes, Iran has no path to produce weapons-grade uranium at any of its known centrifuge plants "for the first time in 15 years." "The military attacks destroyed or made inoperative all of Iran's installed centrifuges — almost 22,000 gas centrifuges — at Iran's three enrichment sites," the analysis said. But the researchers noted it's unclear how long it would take for Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon, since the country may have other centrifuges not yet in use and not destroyed in the strikes. President Donald Trump immediately proclaimed Iran's nuclear program had been "completely and totally obliterated," though skeptics and opponents of the strikes voiced caution about declaring the mission a success before a final damage assessment was finished. While Iran ceased cooperation with nuclear authorities as a result of the strike, its retaliation on U.S. military personnel has been muted.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yet recent events reveal that this claim rings hollow. An adjunct professor at New York University wrote that “MAGAS” are “liars” and “should be excluded from public discourse,” The College Fix reported. But his post, and the replies, are not isolated incidents. “Kill all Charlie Kirks” was spray-painted on a sign in Seattle Central College, which goes to show that leftists hate and their calls for murder have only intensified throughout college campuses. Abaraonye was elected to his seat by a wide margin and previously debated Kirk at the university in May. Now, these remarks do not come as a surprise. As seen last week, we already know that Western academia has fallen victim to the Left's radicalization tactics. Fiona Wild, a local elected official in England, championed his death, saying “good riddance,” and implied that more acts of violence against Kirk's supporters should follow. Fascinating to watch this right now,” the failed political commentator wrote on X. “Charlie Kirk was a horrible, hateful man who spent his life radicalizing young people to embrace their worst demons,” he added in another post. Social media is riddled with similar remarks from liberals who claim Kirk had his days counted.</p>

The Miami Dolphins suffered a tough loss to the New England Patriots on Sunday as pressure ramped up on ownership to make a decision about their general manager and head coach. Mike McDaniel's postgame press conference following the 33-27 defeat didn't exactly do much to inspire confidence among fans. He was asked about the team's failure to convert on fourth down on their final possession of the game. Miami Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel runs to the locker room after the first half of an NFL football game Sunday, Sept. 14, 2025, in Miami Gardens, Florida. "That's kind of where the frustration lies for me is it wasn't deciding that cost us, or a late play call, which that happens at times," McDaniel said. "But this was not one of those times. I got the play call in, but I need to do a better job supervising the orchestration within our multiple personnel groups. "To win games, you have to win the game and not lose the game, honestly. And that is how you lose the game. He later lamented the team failing to properly execute in critical situations. The Patriots' defense got to Tua Tagovailoa twice on the final drive and they committed a delay of game penalty. A plane flew over Hard Rock Stadium that called for the firings of McDaniel and general manager Chris Grier. Miami's schedule isn't getting any easier either. McDaniel said he wasn't necessarily worried about his job security despite starting the season 0-2. "I've never felt entitled to any sort of – I've never felt entitled to this position, and it's very important for me to spend all of my waking hours worrying about exactly how to do my job and all the residual effects of that are there's a lot of people affected. Miami Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel watches as player warm up before an NFL football game Sunday, Sept. 14, 2025, in Miami Gardens, Florida. "Yeah, I won't spend one moment thinking about all the things that people – whatever people want me to think about.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“The Pitt” won best drama series at the 2025 Emmy Awards, while “Adolescence” swept its categories and “The Studio″ set a record for most wins by a comedy series in a single season. Tramell Tillman accepts the award for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for “Severance” during the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday, Sept. 14, 2025, at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles. The Emmy Awards weren't all about Seth Rogen walking up the aisle in his burnt brown tux to collect yet another award. Rogen's “The Studio” won a total of 13 Emmys, breaking the all-time record for most wins for a comedy series. Rogen himself won four, tying the record for most Emmys won by a single individual in one night. “I'm legitimately embarrassed,” Rogen admitted at one point. Owen Cooper, 15, shattered the Emmy record for youngest male acting winner. The “Adolescence” star won best supporting actor in a limited or anthology series. In his acceptance speech, Cooper revealed he only started acting classes a few years ago and encouraged those watching to step out of their comfort zones. “A couple years back I didn't expect to be in the United States, let alone here. The record for youngest male actor had previously been held by Scott Jacoby, who was 16 when he won in the supporting drama actor trophy for “That Certain Summer” in 1973. The youngest Emmy winner ever is Roxana Zal, who won a Primetime Emmy for outstanding supporting actress in a limited series in 1984 at age 14. Cooper beat Javier Bardem, Bill Camp, Rob Delaney, Peter Sarsgaard and his “Adolescence” co-star Ashley Walters. Colbert, who has hosted his show since 2015, was gracious, thanking CBS for his shot and quoting from Prince's hit “Let's Go Crazy”: “If the elevator tries to bring you down/Go crazy, punch a higher floor.” Earlier in the night, he turned his time as award presenter into a job ad, getting a standing ovation as he approached the microphone to announce the winner of lead actor in a comedy series. “While I have your attention, is anyone hiring? Because I've got 200 very well-qualified candidates with me here tonight. He then pulled out a resume and an old headshot but realized he only had the one copy. And most importantly, for the love of God, don't embarrass me in public,” he said. “My first acting coach was tough, y'all, but all great mothers are.” Tillman, holding the statuette high, added: “This is for you. Tramell Tillman accepts the award for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for “Severance” during the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday, Sept. 14, 2025, at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles. Noah Wyle's narrative was just too powerful to deny. After getting five nominations without a win for “ER,” the actor came back to don scrubs 30 years later and won his first Emmy for playing another emergency doctor on “The Pitt.” Wyle thanked HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television for allowing “the conditions to exist for lightning to strike in my life twice.” And then he dedicated his award to those in the health care field. “To anybody who's going on shift tonight or coming off shift tonight, thank you for being in that job. CBS is likely wiping its network forehead that a bitterly divided nation didn't make the Emmys a divisive place. Yes, Javier Bardem wore a kaffiyeh in support of Palestinians and Television Academy Chairman Cris Abrego criticized Congress for voting to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. But Donald Trump and Charlie Kirk were never mentioned on the broadcast and even Stephen Colbert — never shy to mock the powerful — stayed apolitical. The most explosive it got was when “Hacks” star Hannah Einbinder ended her acceptance speech win with vocal support for the Philadelphia Eagles, an expletive aimed at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and a call to “free Palestine.” He revealed he would pledge $100,000 to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America but that donation would shrink by $1,000 for every second a winner exceeded their 45-second speech limit. Some winners went too long — like Einbinder, who promised to pay the difference — and some went purposely fast — like John Oliver and Rogen — to take advantage of a new rule Bargatze proposed: Every second saved from the 45-second limit would get back $1,000. In the end, Bargatze promised to still donate not just the original amount, but — when adding CBS' contribution — came out to be a full $350,000. Then Lainey Wilson and Vince Gill sang a tender “Go Rest High on That Mountain” during the tribute, which included Teri Garr, Ozzy Osbourne, Chuck Woolery, Loni Anderson, Bill Moyers, George Wendt, Loretta Swit. Maggie Smith, David Lynch, Richard Chamberlain, Linda Lavin, Anne Burrell, Michelle Trachtenberg and Quincy Jones. Notable absences were Hulk Hogan and Polly Holliday. Jeff Probst was on hand to celebrate the 50th season of “Survivor,” presenting the award for scripted variety series as if it was a tribal council meeting. Alexis Bledel and Lauren Graham stood in a replica of their Connecticut home set to celebrate “Gilmore Girls,” a coming-of-age story, blending wittiness with relatable family dynamics that celebrated its debut 25 years ago. Additional tributes honored “Law & Order's” 35th anniversary, featuring Ice-T, Tony Goldwyn, Mariska Hargitay, S. Epatha Merkerson and Christopher Meloni. “Grey's Anatomy” — the longest-running prime-time medical drama in American television history — was supposed to mark its 20th anniversary with appearances by Eric Dane and Jesse Williams. Only Williams was there; Dane revealed his ALS diagnosis in April. Ray Romano and Brad Garrett had a mini-reunion of “Everybody Loves Raymond.” It was one of the night's funniest bits, with both men sad about how long it had taken them to be back at the Emmys. “If it's a slow year, no doubt,” Romano told him.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed on Monday that Robinson's DNA was found on a screwdriver and a towel wrapped around the suspected murder weapon. Robinson, who has refused to speak with law enforcement, is being held under “special watch” in Utah. Officials said he fled the scene after assassinating Kirk, 31, at Utah Valley University by jumping from a rooftop. A disturbing note allegedly tied to Robinson was also recovered during the investigation, which federal agents said may point to his political motives and could implicate others in aiding or failing to report the attack. Utah officials said Robinson had developed a strong leftist ideology before allegedly killing Kirk. Investigators recovered bullets inscribed with some messages consistent with left-wing criticisms of conservatives, including one message that appeared to refer to Kirk as a “fascist.” Appearing on Fox News shortly after Patel, Dan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent who is the FBI's deputy director, said agents are aggressively examining Robinson's network. “If this was a larger effort, [if] there was any aiding and abetting … whether it be someone who knew the specifics and failed to report that … we are looking into that,” Bongino said. Additionally, several online users appeared to have predicted the day of the shooting, according to posts reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon, though it is not confirmed whether any of these accounts were privy to any assassination plans. Despite criticism over Patel's premature social media post last week claiming a suspect was already in custody, a statement that was later walked back, Bongino defended the pace and outcome of the investigation. … When everything settled down and I finally got a little bit of sleep last night, it hit me that Charlie's not here anymore, and that was tough for everyone.” Formal criminal charges are expected to be filed against Robinson by Tuesday. Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray said in a statement that he expects those charges to be “consistent” with the preliminary charges Robinson was arrested on, which included aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, and obstruction of justice.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Poland's foreign minister has suggested that NATO states should consider imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine to protect the alliance's territory and people from Russian drones. Radoslaw Sikorski's remarks follow an intrusion last week by Russian drones into Polish airspace. NATO fighter jets and air defenses shot down the drones, which were not armed. Speaking about extending such missions to Ukrainian airspace, Sikorski told the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine: “We as NATO and the EU could be capable of doing this, but it is not a decision that Poland can make alone; it can only be made with its allies.” “Protection for our population – for example, from falling debris – would naturally be greater if we could combat drones and other flying objects beyond our national territory. If you ask me personally, we should consider it,” Sikorski added. A Ukrainian no-fly zone, which was promoted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky soon after Russia invaded Ukraine, was discussed by NATO allies during the Biden administration in 2022 but rejected for fear that direct confrontation with Russian combat planes could broaden the war. A total of 16 drones were found throughout the country after last Wednesday's incursion, Poland's interior ministry said. “The UK's commitment to helping NATO defend every inch of allied territory is unshakeable,” the UK's Ministry of Defense wrote on its X account. “Our air force repelled the threat for seven hours. So far, we have heard two explanations from the Russian government: that the drones accidentally flew over the border and that it is impossible for Russian drones to fly that far at all.” Russia's defense ministry said last week that it had carried out a strike against Ukraine overnight into Wednesday. It said that “no targets on the territory of Poland were planned for destruction,” and that the drones it used in Ukraine have a flight range of no more than 700 kilometers (435 miles). In addition to the intrusion into Poland, just days later Romania scrambled fighter jets after a Russian drone breached its airspace on Saturday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A deal has been reached between the Trump administration and China to keep TikTok operational in the United States, administration officials announced Monday, concluding a yearslong effort that began during President Donald Trump's first term. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that a framework agreement has been reached, and Trump will speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping Friday to finalize the deal. “President Trump played a role in this, we had a call with him last night, we had specific guidance from him we shared it with our Chinese counterparts,” Bessent said in Madrid on Monday. “We were very focused on TikTok and making sure that it was a deal that is fair for the Chinese and completely respects US national security concerns, and that's the deal we reached,” said US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Monday. “And of course, we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that US national security comes first.” TikTok and its parent company ByteDance did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment about the status of a deal. A bipartisan bill passed by Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden banned TikTok in the United States because of national security concerns, allowing the app to continue operating in America only if its China-based owner divested its stake in the US assets of the social media company. The White House launched a new TikTok account, just weeks away from President Trump's extended deadline for TikTok to sell the app. White House joins TikTok amid uncertainty over app's future But on January 19, one day before Trump took office for his second term, he said he would sign an executive action upon the beginning of his term that would ensure US companies would not be punished for hosting TikTok on their app stores or servers. The deadline had most recently been extended to September 17, but Trump was widely expected to move the deadline again if a deal didn't come together in time. But critics have said Trump's extensions thwarted the will of Congress. Trump toward the end of his first term had advocated for banning TikTok — a policy he never got passed but which Biden eventually supported and signed into law. But Trump's opinion eventually changed after he viewed the social media app as contributing to his election victory in 2024. TikTok boasts around 170 million US users, many of them young people – a contingent that offered significantly more support to the Republican presidential candidate in the 2024 election than that segment of the population has in recent years. Trump has repeatedly said a deal is close, but no breakthrough emerged until Monday. Among the most prominent has been led by former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt and investor Kevin O'Leary of “Shark Tank” fame, who have made several public pleas to own TikTok, and who made an offer to ByteDance. But TikTok would likely cost more than the group can afford — likely in the tens of billions of dollars. So that group said it offered to purchase TikTok's US assets without the app's secret sauce: its algorithm that hooks users into watching video after video on the platform. That's why industry analysts believe a much more likely candidate to buy TikTok's US assets is Ellison, who has the capability of leading a group of investors with the money to buy the algorithm — and whose company already has a relationship with TikTok. Oracle in 2020 began hosting TikTok's US data, and it briefly reached a deal with the first Trump administration that year to buy TikTok, before that deal was ultimately blocked. It has since been heavily debated whether any amount of Chinese ownership would be allowed by law, and the Trump administration didn't clarify what kind of agreement it had secured on Monday. But as trade tensions between the companies reached an inflection point in the spring and continued throughout the summer – evidenced by China's announcement Monday that Nvidia had violated its antitrust laws – Chinese authorities apparently decided that it should play ball. The agreement also appears to be a precursor to a Trump-Xi meeting that both sides have sought for months. Trump in late October and early November has an Asia trip planned, and their first in-person meeting of Trump's second term could, in theory, take place then. Trump on Monday hinted that a deal is now close. It will be concluding shortly,” Trump said Monday in a post on Truth Social. “A deal was also reached on a ‘certain' company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save. I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday.” Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly attributed a quote characterizing the deal as fair for China while respecting US national security concerns.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following the Mediterranean diet reduces your risk of gum disease, which reduces your risk for inflammation that leads to chronic disease and dementia, a new study found. While that may seem like an odd combination, it actually makes scientific sense, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. Mediterranean diet: How to start (and stay on) one of the world's healthiest diets “We've known for a really long time that periodontal or gum health is associated with cardiovascular disease and vice versa — they're interconnected. We also know that people that have periodontal disease typically have markers of inflammation,” said Freeman, who was not involved in the study. Vascular dementia is the second most common form of cognitive deterioration after Alzheimer's disease. “It certainly makes sense that if you are eating a very clean, predominantly plant-based diet such as the Mediterranean diet, inflammation is down,” Freeman said. “This has to be the real deal — a true plant-first diet.” Studies have found the award-winning Mediterranean diet can reduce the risk for diabetes, high cholesterol, dementia, memory loss, depression and breast cancer. The diet, which is more of an eating style than a restricted diet, has also been linked to stronger bones and a healthier heart. Fats other than olive oil, such as butter, are consumed rarely, if at all, and sugar and refined foods are reserved for special occasions. Red meat is used sparingly, usually only to flavor a dish. Eating healthy, oily fish, which are packed with omega-3 fatty acids, is encouraged, while eggs, dairy and poultry are eaten in much smaller portions than in the traditional Western diet. Lifestyle changes that are part of the diet include eating with friends and family, socializing over meals, mindfully eating favorite foods, as well as mindful movement and exercise. Scientists performed dental exams and took blood samples — participants also filled out dietary questionnaires. “Low adherence to Mediterranean diet and higher red meat consumption were associated with severity of periodontal disease,” said senior study author Luigi Nibali, a dentist and professor of periodontology at King's College London in an email. However, sometimes there is an exaggerated response which can lead to more gum disease. Higher levels of these markers mean more inflammation,” Nibali said. “Higher consumption of vegetables, legumes and dairy products were correlated with lower inflammatory marker C-reactive protein, so they seem to be helpful. There were some beneficial trends also for fruit and olive oil,” he added. And then if you eat a diet that is more in line with the health of the body, everything seems to be better, including your teeth.” Sign up for CNN's Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Democrats search for a national leader to rally behind, House and Senate Minority Leaders Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) are on the same page heading into a partisan spending battle and contentious elections this November. But recently, Jeffries and Schumer have presented a unified front, especially when it comes to conversations on a short-term spending deal to keep the government open before funding runs out on Sept. 30. Leaving a meeting on Thursday, both Democratic leaders said they were “totally united” and in agreement on a spending deal that extracts healthcare concessions from the GOP. This is a different approach from what occurred during the last spending fight in March, in which Democrats found themselves in a civil war over Schumer's decision to help Republicans break the 60-vote filibuster to advance the last continuing resolution. Top Democrats, including Jeffries, refused to answer questions for days about Schumer's viability as a leader, while others said they disagreed with his decision but understood there were no good options. Some even raised the possibility that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) should primary him. However, this time around, Democrats are more united as the party argues it needs to fight back harder against the Trump administration, the executive orders and rescission requests of which have given Democrats no appetite to help Republicans. But, notably, he has not received endorsements from Jeffries or Schumer. When pressed by reporters on Sept. 8 on whether he would endorse Mamdani soon, Jeffries said, “I have more to say about the mayor's race when I have more to say about the mayor's race.” He also said he had no plans “at the moment” to chat with Mamdani again after meeting with him first in July and again in mid-August. “Who said it's a difficult topic?” Jeffries asked when pressed further by reporters. Schumer has also not endorsed Mamdani despite meeting with him on Sept. 9. But Mamdani has not appeared to feel slighted by the lack of an endorsement from the two Brooklyn natives, with his spokesperson speaking highly of Schumer in a statement to Politico. Eyes will be on Jeffries and Schumer to see whether they remain unified heading into the next two weeks. “It seems Democrats may take the path of maximum resistance and try to shut the government down,” Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) said on Sept. 9. “It's not surprising, 'cause they're struggling, and they don't really have a message or a leader, and party registration is falling.” But many Democrats, including a few Republicans, are pushing for a bipartisan agreement to include extending the Obamacare premium tax credits in any continuing resolution. Johnson's right flank is likely not to vote for any spending deal that includes the credits, and even other top Republicans like Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington (R-TX) have said they don't have a desire to extend them as is.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arthur Sze attends the 70th National Book Awards ceremony on Nov. 20, 2019, in New York. At a time when its leadership is in question and its mission challenged, the Library of Congress has named a new U.S. poet laureate, the much-honored author and translator Arthur Sze. The author of 12 poetry collections and recipient last year of a lifetime achievement award from the library, he succeeds Ada Limón, who had served for three years. Previous laureates also include Joy Harjo, Louise Glück and Billy Collins. Speaking during a recent Zoom interview with The Associated Press, Sze acknowledged some misgivings when Rob Casper, who heads the library's poetry and literature center, called him in June about becoming the next laureate. He wondered about the level of responsibilities and worried about the upheaval since President Donald Trump fired Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden in May. After thinking about it overnight, he called Casper back and happily accepted. “So many people have helped me along the way. Poetry has just helped me grow so much, in every way.” Trump abruptly fired Hayden after conservative activists accused her of imposing a “woke” agenda, criticism that Trump has expressed often as he seeks sweeping changes at the Kennedy Center, the Smithsonian museums and other cultural institutions. Although the White House announced that it had named Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche as the acting librarian, daily operations are being run by a longtime official at the library, Robert Randolph Newlen. Events such as the annual National Book Festival have continued without interruption or revision. Laureates are forbidden to take political positions, although the tradition was breached in 2003 when Collins publicly stated his objections to President George W. Bush's push for war against Iraq. Newlen is identified in Monday's announcement as acting librarian, a position he was in line for according to the institution's guidelines. He praised Sze, whose influences range from ancient Chinese poets to Wallace Stevens, for his “distinctly American” portraits of the Southwest landscapes and for his “great formal innovation.” The mission is loosely defined as a kind of literary ambassador, to “raise the national consciousness to a greater appreciation of the reading and writing of poetry.” Initiatives have included Robert Pinsky's “Favorite Poem Project,” for which the public would share thoughts on works of their choosing, and Limón's “You Are Here,” which included poetry installations at national parks. Sze wants to focus on a passion going back more than a half-century to his undergraduate years at the University of California, Berkeley — translation. He remembers reading some English-language editions of Chinese poetry, finding the work “antiquated and dated” and deciding to translate some of it himself, writing out the Chinese characters and engaging with them “on a much deeper level” than he had expected. Sze is a New York City native and son of Chinese immigrants who in such collections as “Sight Lines” and “Compass Rose” explores themes of cultural and environmental diversity and what he calls “coexisting.” In a given poem, he might shift from rocks above a pond to people begging in a subway, from a firing squad in China to Thomas Jefferson's plantation in Virginia. “I was just looking at the word ‘ketchup,' which started from southern China, went to Malaysia, was taken to England, where it became a tomato-based sauce, and then, of course, to America,” he says. “And I was just thinking days ago, that's a word we use every day without recognizing its ancestry, how it's crossed borders, how it's entered into the English language and enriched it.”</p>

ATLANTA (AP) — A popular museum in Atlanta is expanding at a critical moment in the United States. And unlike the Smithsonian Institution, the privately funded National Center for Civil and Human Rights is beyond the immediate reach of Trump administration efforts to control what Americans learn about their history. The monthslong renovation, which cost nearly $60 million, adds six new galleries as well as classrooms and interactive experiences, changing a relatively static museum into a dynamic place where people are encouraged to take action supporting civil and human rights, racial justice and the future of democracy, said Jill Savitt, the center's president and CEO. The center has stayed active ahead of its Nov. 8 reopening through K-12 education programs that include more than 300 online lesson plans; a LGBTQ+ Institute; training in diversity, equity and inclusion; human rights training for law enforcement; and its Truth & Transformation Initiative to spread awareness about forced labor, racial terror and other historic injustices. These are the same aspects of American history, culture and society that the Trump administration is seeking to dismantle. Now the center hopes to attract more repeat visitors with immersive experiences like “Change Agent Adventure,” aimed at children under 12. And that's the ethos of this gallery,” Savitt said. “I think advocacy and change-making is kind of addictive. And our desire here is to whet the appetite of kids to see that they can be involved. “In fact, I think it's what makes America great. It is something to be patriotically proud of. The way activists over time have worked together through nonviolence and changed democracy to expand human freedom — there's nothing more American and nothing greater than that. “Broken Promises,” opening in December, includes exhibits from the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, cut short when white mobs sought to brutally reverse advances by formerly enslaved people. On display will be a Georgia historical marker from the site of the 1918 lynching of Mary Turner, pockmarked repeatedly with bullets, that Turner descendants donated to keep it from being vandalized again. “There are 11 bullet holes and 11 grandchildren living,” and the family's words will be incorporated into the exhibit to show their resilience, Pierce said. Items from the Morehouse College Martin Luther King Jr. collection will have a much more prominent place, in a room that recreates King's home office, with family photos contributed by the center's first guest curator: his daughter, the Rev. Gone are the huge images of the world's most genocidal leaders — Hitler, Stalin and Mao among others — with explanatory text about the millions of people killed under their orders. In their place will be examples of human rights victories by groups working around the world. “The research says that if you tell people things are really bad and how awful they are, you motivate people for a minute, and then apathy sets in because it's too hard to do anything,” Savitt said. “But if you give people something to hope for that's positive, that they can see themselves doing, you're more likely to cultivate a sense of agency in people.” And doubling in capacity is an experience many can't forget: Joining a 1960s sit-in against segregation. Wearing headphones as they take a lunch-counter stool, visitors can both hear and feel an angry, segregationist mob shouting they don't belong. Because this is “heavy content,” Savitt says, a new “reflection area” will allow people to pause afterward on a couch, with tissues if they need them, to consider what they've just been through. The center's expansion was seeded by Home Depot co-founder and Atlanta philanthropist Arthur M. Blank, the Mellon Foundation and many other donors, for which Savitt expressed gratitude: “The corporate community is in a defensive crouch right now — they could get targeted,” she said. But she said donors shared concerns about people's understanding of citizenship, so supporting the teaching of civil and human rights makes a good investment. “It is the story of democracy — Who gets to participate? Who gets to have a voice?” she said. “So our donors are very interested in a healthy, safe, vibrant, prosperous America, which you need a healthy democracy to have.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON — President Donald Trump will travel to the United Kingdom this week for a three-day state visit as the president navigates tense trade talks and war in Europe. Trump's first state visit was in 2019, three years before the death of Queen Elizabeth II. Furthermore, Starmer and other European executives have substantially shifted Trump's position on the war in Ukraine. On the campaign trail, Trump and his allies frequently criticized U.S. aid of Ukraine's defense efforts, but this summer saw Trump turn up the heat on Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his invasion, even if the president's efforts to bring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Putin to the negotiating table have stalled in recent weeks. While Trump will meet with Starmer multiple times on this trip, stretching from Sept. 16 to 18, the prime minister will receive a royal assist in keeping the U.K. in Trump's good graces. Famed British historian Sir Anthony Seldon notes that the Crown, though lacking much actual authority, can still flex the soft power necessary to maintain relations with a leader like Trump. “Is there any leader anywhere in the world who has quite that same attraction to Donald Trump as the British monarch?” Seldon told Reuters. As if that wasn't enough, Trump is expected to take part in a wreath-laying ceremony at the tomb of Queen Elizabeth II in Windsor and, on Wednesday, following meetings at Chequers with Starmer and his wife, Lady Victoria, take a personal trip through the Sir Winston Churchill archives. Trump has repeatedly pointed to Churchill as one of his greatest political influences and maintained a bust of the former British prime minister in the Oval Office throughout both of his terms in the White House. Melania Trump will similarly receive personal attention from the queen and princess. While Trump is soaking up Churchill, Camilla will guide the first lady through a tour of Queen Mary's Dolls' House, before Melania joins Catherine for an event at Frogmore Gardens to visit with Scouts Association members. Still, Trump's visit may feature more than a few hiccups. Sir Ed Davey, the leader of Britain's Liberal Democrats, has already announced plans to boycott Trump's banquet, based on America's support of Israel's war in Gaza, and the U.K.'s Stop Trump Coalition is planning a protest around Trump's arrival in London. “Trump's politics have encouraged this resurgence of hate in both countries.” “Starmer rolling out the red carpet for Trump sends a deeply dangerous message and does nothing to provide support to communities seeing a surge in racism in the UK. “We're calling on everyone who opposes today's scenes to join us on Wednesday and say: not in our name.</p>
