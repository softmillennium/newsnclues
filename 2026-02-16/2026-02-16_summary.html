The camp was established in Fort Snelling, Minnesota, near the site of a former US internment camp for Dakota people.

Fort Snelling, Minnesota – Last week, Native activists established a prayer camp near the site of a former internment camp for Dakota people.

The camp was established in Fort Snelling, Minnesota, just across a highway from the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, which has become a major center for immigration enforcement detainment processing, but the site has a much longer and more complex history.

The United States used Fort Snelling as a concentration camp during the Dakota Indian Wars to imprison thousands of Dakota and Ho-Chunk people in abysmal conditions.

Migizi Spears, Red Lake Nation citizen and organizer for First Nations United, helped establish the camp, along with Dakota, Nakota and other tribal citizens. They raised four teepees at a place that the Dakota considered a creation site called Bdóte near the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers and within earshot of the Whipple Building.

Spears said he felt it was time to take back the land that his ancestors lost and from which they were removed following the Dakota War of 1862, also known as the Sioux or Dakota Uprising. Following the conflict, 38 Dakota men were hanged in the largest mass execution in U.S. history.

“We are getting the land back for our Dakota people who were exiled out,” Spears said. “Now they're imprisoning brown people and other Indigenous people in there. Now they're removing them too. History is repeating itself.”

Many Native and other activists have joined Spears and the other camp founders last week, erecting yurts and bringing firewood, food and other essentials.

The camp has drawn the attention of media organizations, including CBS News Minnesota and Unicorn Riot, as well as many social media influencers.

Currently, Fort Snelling houses the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, Fort Snelling State Park, several federal buildings including the Whipple building and the recreation of the historic Fort Snelling. The Whipple building is less than a mile from the Historic Fort Snelling complex, which is owned by the state of Minnesota.

Wasuduta, Dakota, said the use of the former Fort Snelling site as a federal detention center serves as a reminder of the federal government's ongoing efforts to deprive Native people and Hispanic immigrants of their rights.

He said he's hopeful more Indigenous peoples, non-Native allies and tribes will get involved in the effort to get the federal government and the state of Minnesota to give land back to Native people.

Despite the Trump administration's decision to withdraw many of the federal immigration agents who were part of the recent surge in Minneapolis, Wasuduta said the camp will remain.

“It's time to hold them accountable with diplomacy,” he said. “We're not here to be hostile or trigger them.”

The need for truthful, grassroots reporting is urgent at this cataclysmic historical moment.

Property where abuse took place purchased for $13.4m in 2023 by Texas businessman Donald Huffines' family

The family of a self-identified “Trump Republican” running for office in Texas bought Jeffrey Epstein's New Mexico ranch where the sex trafficker abused teenage girls and young women, according to new documents.

A spokesperson for Donald Huffines, a Texas businessman and former GOP state senator now running for comptroller, confirmed the purchase to the Santa Fe New Mexican, a local media outlet.

“Four years after Mr Epstein's death, the Huffines family purchased property in New Mexico listed at public auction whose proceeds benefited his victims,” a spokesperson for the family, Allen Blakemore, wrote to the outlet. “Prior to the auction listing, they had never visited the property.”
  In 2023, San Rafael Ranch LLC, created by the Huffines, bought the nearly 10,000-acre (4,000-hectare) property – then known as the Zorro ranch – for an undisclosed price. Previously the buyers had been private, as New Mexico allows anonymous ownership of private property through LLCs.

The ranch was initially valued at $21.1m for the 2023 tax year, a figure the Huffines argued was overstated in part due to its “notoriety”; Santa Fe county then reassessed the value of the property to just $13.4m. Court records obtained by the New Mexican connected the LLC to Mary Catherine Huffines, who is listed as the “client/property owner”.

Huffines is currently the frontrunner for the GOP comptroller primary race in Texas, according to recent polling reported by the Texas Tribune. He is campaigning to “DOGE Texas government”, a reference to the controversial so-called department of government efficiency, once run by Elon Musk, which conducted chaotic mass federal workforce layoffs and cancelled billions in federal contracts and grants. 
  Huffines' campaign website describes him as “a successful businessman, 5th-generation Texan, and Trump Republican who will bring a private-sector mindset to the Comptroller's office and put Texas first”. He touts endorsements from “top MAGA leaders”, including Ted Cruz, the late Charlie Kirk, former college swimmer turned anti-trans activist Riley Gaines, Ron Paul and Vivek Ramaswamy.

Huffines' spokesperson did not answer questions about the purpose of the property purchase from the Santa Fe New Mexican.

The revelation comes as the Trump administration attempts to turn the page on the Epstein files, in which the president is referenced thousands of times. After making the release of the files a feature of his 2024 presidential campaign, he then retreated, only releasing more files following intense bipartisan pressure. The files detail the friendship between the two men, including an alleged sexually suggestive birthday note from Trump to Epstein on his 50th birthday.

Recent Guardian reporting shed further light on the role of Epstein's ranch in his years of sex trafficking and abuse of underage girls. The Zorro ranch was a place where powerful men allegedly visited, including a former governor of the state. It was also the alleged setting for Epstein's previously reported plans to spread his DNA across the human race by impregnating as many women as possible. Newly released photos showed that at various times the late French modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel, linguist Noam Chomsky and film-maker Woody Allen were guests.

Croatia refused to transport Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia following a request from the two countries, Croatian Economy Minister Ante Susnjar said on Feb. 16.

According to Ante, Zagreb "will not allow" Central Europe's fuel supply "to be endangered" and is ready to help resolve the disruption in compliance with EU law and the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) regulations.

Earlier in the day, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Budapest and Bratislava had asked Croatia for help in securing Russian oil through the Adria pipeline following disruptions in supply via Ukraine.

The transport of Russian oil through the Druzhba pipeline via Ukraine has been halted since late January due to relentless Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, according to Ukrainian officials. In the meantime, Szijjarto accused Kyiv of stopping oil flows for "political reasons."

Ante said that no EU country has any "technical excuses" left for remaining dependent on Russian oil.

"A barrel bought from Russia may appear cheaper to some countries, but helps fund war and attacks on Ukrainian people. It's time to stop that war profiteering," Ante said.

Along with Slovak Economy Minister Denisa Sakova, Szijjarto earlier sent a letter to Ante, saying that their countries' sanctions exemption "provides the possibility to import Russian oil by sea if pipeline deliveries are disrupted."

"The security of a country's energy supply must never be an ideological issue," the Hungarian minister said. "We therefore expect Croatia, unlike Ukraine, not to endanger the oil supply security of Hungary and Slovakia for political reasons."

The Druzhba pipeline, one of the world's largest with a capacity of 2 million barrels per day, is a critical conduit for oil from Russian fields to European refineries. It remains a lifeline for Hungary and Slovakia, the only EU countries still importing Russian crude through the system.

As tensions between Kyiv and Budapest grew, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha posted a photo last week showing the burning Druzhba after a rare Russian strike on the pipeline on Ukrainian territory. Ukrainian forces have attacked the pipeline multiple times on Russian soil.

"Hungary made no protest to Russia about it. They could not even pronounce the word 'Russia,'" Sybiha wrote on X. 

"The truth is that Moscow stopped being a reliable supplier the moment it launched its aggression against Ukraine. And this aggression is the cause of all problems."

Herman Halushchenko, Ukraine's former energy minister, was charged of money laundering and involvement in a criminal group as part of the country's major corruption scandal, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) announced on Feb. 16. 

Dismissing any approximations to Article 5 as mere "rhetorical expressions," Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys named financial support for Ukraine's military or future EU membership as more realistic guarantees.

"A barrel bought from Russia may appear cheaper to some countries, but helps fund war and attacks on Ukrainian people. It's time to stop that war profiteering," Croatian Economy Minister Ante Susnjar said.

The 7th Corps report comes as Ukraine clings to its last positions in Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad in eastern Donetsk Oblast, both of which have mostly been occupied by Russia, Emil Kastehelmi, a military analyst with the Black Bird Group, told the Kyiv Independent.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has classified the car bombing as a terrorist attack and opened a criminal investigation, the agency said.

The strikes targeted areas where Moscow had concentrated its troops, along with a Russian communications hub and a drone control center, the report read. 



Two districts on the east bank of the Dnipro River were the most affected, leaving 1,100 residential buildings without heating, Kateryna Pop, a spokesperson for the Kyiv City Military Administration, said.



"This is a second time for the past year, when a Ukrainian woman who is a refugee and is hiding for safety in North Carolina, gets murdered by a man," said the brother of the late Kateryna Tovmash.

Russian forces attacked Ukraine with four Zirkon anti-ship hypersonic missiles, an Iskander-M ballistic missile, a Kh-31 medium-range missile, and 62 drones, of which about 40 were Shahed-type, the Air Force said.



The number includes 1,180 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

Sumy Oblast Governor Oleh Hryhoriv reported that a Russian drone targeted unspecified "medical infrastructure" in the city of Sumy overnight on Feb. 14-15, causing damage to the target.

            Dana Eden, an Israeli producer best known for co-creating the Apple TV show “Tehran,” was found dead on Sunday in Athens, where the show's fourth season was being filmed, Greek police said.
    


            Eden, 52, was found dead in a hotel room after a relative made several failed attempts to reach her. Police said that her death is being treated as a suicide, Reuters reported.
    


            “We mourn the passing of our friend and partner in a long line of productions, series and programs at the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation,” Kan, Israel's public broadcaster, said in a statement.
    


            Kan said that Eden had traveled to Greece to oversee the “complex and significant production” of the fourth season of “Tehran,” a spy thriller that premiered in 2020 and received an International Emmy Award in 2021 for best drama series.
    


            “Her professional work, uncompromising commitment and love of creation have left a deep mark on the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation,” Kan added.
    


            “Tehran” follows the plight of Tamar Rabinyan, a young Mossad agent born in Iran but raised in Israel who returns to Iran on a mission to sabotage Iran's nuclear program. Since Israelis are banned from visiting Iran, the show was filmed in Athens, due to its similarities with the Iranian capital.
    


            In her Emmy acceptance speech, Eden said that working on the show with Iranian actors who had fled the regime showed her that “we have a lot in common.”
    


            “Tehran is not only an espionage series. It's also about understanding the human behind your enemy,” she said. “I hope we can walk together – the Iranians and the Israelis, in Jerusalem and in Tehran – as friends, and not as enemies.”
    


            Much of Eden's work was in collaboration with Shula Spiegel, who also worked as a producer on “Tehran.” The pair's production company, Dana and Shula Productions, said Eden's death was “a moment of great pain for the family, friends and colleagues.”
    


            Miki Zohar, Israel's culture minister, said he received the news of Eden's death “with great sadness,” praising her as “one of the most prominent and influential producers in the Israeli television industry.”
    


            “Dana left a deep mark on Israeli creation and brought our story to international stages with pride, talent and courage. I share in the sorrow of the family, friends and colleagues. May her memory be a blessing,” Zohar said.

Tech billionaires want to create their own city-states. Hondurans pay the price.

In April 2025, Peter Thiel's Palantir made headlines after documents were released detailing its partnership with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to create ImmigrationOS, a massive database of information gathered from a variety of sources including the IRS, in order to surveil, detain, and deport immigrants. Thiel is not new to spearheading endeavors that aim to dehumanize and attack people of color. In fact, the tech mogul is one of the billionaires leading our modern-day version of tech neocolonialism, the new-yet-old imperial monster that colonizes land, extracts resources, exploits natives, and is happy to profit off of their suffering. 

As a Honduran immigrant myself, I would know.

In 2009, Honduras found itself in turmoil after a military coup destabilized the country leading to unprecedented levels of violence and repression. Taking a page out of the “shock doctrine” playbook, the elite political actors behind the coup (including narco-dictator Juan Orlando Hernández, now pardoned by Donald Trump after being sentenced to 45 years in prison for drug trafficking and weapons charges) watered down environmental protections on Honduran land and approved illegal contracts to sell Indigenous and protected land to the highest bidder.

Among other corrupt dealings and land grabs, the government approved a law that enabled the creation of Peter Thiel's Zones for Employment and Economic Development (ZEDEs). ZEDEs derive from the idea of “charter cities.” Proposed by former World Bank executive and economist Paul Romer, these proposed cities are enclaves within lower-income nations that “promote economic growth” through privatization and the disposal of national regulations, while gifting major tax incentives for foreign nations to invest in businesses. Special economic zones in Kenya, Bangladesh, and Ethiopia have faced criticism due to low wages, harsh working conditions, and threats to rights to free association and collective bargaining. Romer, one of the initial proponents of ZEDEs in Honduras, expressed criticism in 2015 regarding the Honduran ZEDEs and their lack of accountability to local laws, and anti-democratic governance.  

These ZEDEs are a project of Praxis, a tech billionaire-funded start-up that aims to create libertarian city-states to “restore Western Civilization.” The ZEDEs are allowed to have their own government, police force, courts, laws, and any taxes collected would not be paid to the Honduran government but to the ZEDEs themselves. ZEDEs are a tech billionaire's dream: unbridled power, tech fantasy, and resource hoarding, where the government is run by AI and cryptocurrency is the main currency.

Próspera (one of the three ZEDEs in Honduras) even has a Bitcoin center paired with tech companies that offer $25,000 gene therapy and “subdermal implantation services and a variety of cybernetic upgrades.” Próspera is located in Roatan, a Honduran island named one of the World's Greatest Places in 2023 by TIME magazine. Roatan is a Caribbean tropical beauty surrounded by the second-largest coral reef in the world, and home to rich Afro-descendant culture, the Garifuna people who have been fighting threats to their sovereignty for centuries. A sought-after spot for foreign luxury tourism and investment, Roatan saw the foundation of Próspera in 2017 with funding from the likes of Peter Thiel and Pronomos Capital led by Patri Friedman, a grandson of Milton Friedman, seen by many as the father of neoliberalism, deregulation, and privatization.

There are endless reasons why ZEDEs are dangerous for the Honduran people. Human rights organizations have rung the alarm on how they have been displacing Indigenous communities who have ancestral ties to the land and expropriating their territory.

Greicy, an Indigenous Garífuna woman from Triunfo de la Cruz on the coast of Honduras, identifies similarities between the ZEDE in Próspera and other illegal land grabs and land dispossession in her ancestral hometown. Due to safety concerns, Greicy is only sharing her first name for this article.

“Even though they say otherwise, I see that only the rich are benefiting, knowing full well that we Garífuna people live off the beach, we live off tourism, we live off fishing, and we also live off growing our own food, cultivating our own food, harvesting and planting our own food. Right? But now we don't have any land left,” she said.

Harassment, violence, and threats from the Honduran police force led Greicy to migrate North to New Orleans, standing as a living testimony of how neocolonialism has displaced millions of families in the Global South.

Greicy's family was part of the 2015 Inter-American Court ruling that found the state of Honduras guilty of violating the rights of the Garifuna people in Triunfo de la Cruz and Punta Piedra, and ordered the state to pay restitution for their communal land rights. Despite the ruling, the Honduran state has not started any process of restitution, with threats and violence towards Garifuna leaders persisting. Greicy sees ZEDEs as the ultimate tool to dispossess the Garifuna people of their ancestral homeland.

“In Honduras, the ruling has not been carried out, the demands have not been met. And I imagine there would be even more land dispossession [with more ZEDES], dispossession not only of homes, but of people's very means of survival. Yes, it would be worse because we know that all these special economic development zones benefit high-ranking officials, wealthy individuals with investments, and foreign investors who attend political meetings. And how does this benefit the people? Not at all. Exactly,” she explained.

Concerns regarding ZEDEs and neocolonialist dispossession of communities on the North coast of Honduras often involve drug-trafficking activity, including money laundering, says Greicy.

“Those who are going to invest there are Americans. One reason is to bring in their prohibited substances, because we know that's also included in the deal. Money laundering is also involved, right? When they go to the beaches, supposedly for tourists, and all that, that's also money laundering, because the beach is a free zone, merchandise is smuggled there, everything is sold there. And someone like me, living in the town, just stays quiet because of fear…. If I were in Honduras, I tell you, I wouldn't be telling you this,” she said.

Greicy's fear is not unfounded: Research on special economic zones such as the ones in China has documented “economic gray zones” inside the enclaves where drugs, money laundering, and human trafficking abound. Others are concerned about how ZEDEs have the power to create inhumane labor laws to exploit Hondurans, but let's take a moment to look at the big picture.

ZEDEs are the tech billionaire representation of neocolonialism; taking hold of Honduran land, resources, and a workforce to build playground empires for tech billionaires to avoid constitutional protections, government accountability, or even human rights protections.

In 2022, the new government of Honduras repealed the ZEDEs law, which led to a $10.7 billion lawsuit from Thiel's Próspera that could bankrupt an already struggling country. Unfortunately, the ZEDEs law has a loophole that has allowed the so-called “digital nations” like Próspera to continue.

In December 2025, Honduras concluded a presidential election completely tainted by U.S. intervention via Donald Trump's public support for the right-wing Nationalist Party candidate Nasry Asfura, as well as Trump's threats to cut U.S. aid to Honduras if another candidate won. The connection of special interests between Trump, his tech billionaire friends, and ZEDEs are clear, and Nasry stands as the champion that will do Trump's and Thiel's bidding at the expense of the lives and rights of the Honduran people.

Greicy explained the dire position of immigrants facing dispossession in their ancestral homeland — and detention, surveillance, and violence in the United States at the hand of the same powerful forces.

If the expansion of more ZEDEs in Honduras were to happen, “immigration is going to get worse, because we know that those of us who are here want to leave, and the people who are there are being forced out and will come here. They will come seeking political asylum, something that will be denied to them,” she said.

It is not the first time Thiel has used people of color in crisis as a laboratory for his monstrous oligarchic fantasies. Thiel's Palantir is one of the main providers of advanced AI targeting software and hardware to Israeli forces; the technology is used to target, surveil, and murder Palestinians. As a genocide continues under a ceasefire that has not been respected by Israel, Palantir continues to, as its CEO Alex Karp said in an understatement, “occasionally kill people.” Palantir not only provides the technology to massacre Palestinians but also trained its AI models with secretly received National Security Agency raw data of emails and phone conversations between Palestinians in occupied territories and their family in the U.S.

In 2020, Karp admitted that Palantir “[finds] people in our country who are undocumented,” referring to contracts with the Department of Homeland Security to use Palantir to surveil undocumented immigrants. Thiel and his billionaire gang are building a new profit frontier off of the livelihoods of people of color. The theft of land and resources, the mass surveillance and endless data collection — Thiel's pet projects regard immigrants and people of color as expendable. We are one more resource they will gladly extract, whether it is our land, labor, data, or our own lives. As data centers gobble up resources in the form of drinkable water and energy, the technology they house exploits people of color, whether it's through biased facial recognition tech or predictive policing technology that tries to criminalize us.

Just like the Spanish colonized Latin America through forced labor, extraction of resources, and subjugation of the Indigenous peoples, Peter Thiel and his gang of tech billionaires are drafting up plans to re-colonize Latin America, occupying land, displacing native inhabitants, and then profiting from surveilling and incarcerating them after they are forced to flee to the United States. Thiel, conveniently, has lately been preaching the coming of an “antichrist” in the guise of environmentalism, guardrails on technology, and international agencies, even singling out Greta Thunberg as the possible antichrist. On the topic of the libertarian utopia of “charter cities” like Próspera, Thiel has said “the nature of government is about to change at a very fundamental level.”

Ultimately, Palantir's ImmigrationOS is a weapon that ICE and other government agencies use to detain kidnapped immigrants under inhumane conditions and force them to perform manual labor in detention centers. A trans detainee in a Louisiana ICE jail denounced this forced manual labor in 2025 — in his case, he was force to carry cinder blocks — and then faced sexual harassment after speaking out against this unsanctioned practice. As Palantir facilitates forced labor schemes, Thiel amasses power through his investments in Facebook, Donald Trump, and ZEDEs.

From the U.S. to Honduras, tech billionaires are waging a war on people of color. These oligarchs are employing the old and overused re-packaging of neocolonialism and repression as “development” and “progress” — even labeling AI tech as “inevitable.” When feeling overwhelmed by the power and influence of tech billionaires who care not about our lives or the planet but only about endless profit, I remind myself that they are quite literally a 1 percent. We are an undeniable winning force if we come together.

Tech billionaires are not the future. They are just another colonizer looking for a scheme to grow power and wealth on our backs. To start, we can always hit them where they care the most, their money — boycott generative AI, fight against data centers, fight against and denounce Palantir contracts being paid with our tax money, and support Indigenous communities fighting against ZEDEs. Let's ditch the glorification of billionaires like Thiel and Musk who care only about power and profit. Let's call them what they are: colonizers that see us, people of color, as their new profit frontier.

In the last weeks, we have witnessed an authoritarian assault on communities in Minnesota and across the nation.

The need for truthful, grassroots reporting is urgent at this cataclysmic historical moment. Yet, Trump-aligned billionaires and other allies have taken over many legacy media outlets — the culmination of a decades-long campaign to place control of the narrative into the hands of the political right.

The South Central Correctional Center leaves LGBTQ people defenseless, so they're organizing to fight for their safety.

In the United States, it is possible to be unhoused even inside a prison. At the South Central Correctional Center in Tennessee, people sleep in doorways, closets, or even in the showers. “Anywhere that's pretty much off camera,” said Bishop, a man imprisoned in the facility who chose not to use his last name out of fear of retaliation.

Atticus, another man in the prison, told Truthout he knows at least a couple people living within the prison “who are actually homeless on a more permanent basis, people bouncing around from place to place.” These folks have no bed to sleep in at night, and no place to leave their belongings.

Sources imprisoned at South Central described a different sort of housing crisis, one that takes place inside the walls of the institution that is charged with providing for them. The prison is run by CoreCivic, and, like other CoreCivic prisons in Tennessee, has been the subject of recent investigations because of the rampant violence and extortion that gang members in the prison perpetrate on newer or unaffiliated people. LGBTQ+ people in the prison say this violence often targets them specifically.

Conditions at South Central are just one example of the broader problem that LGBTQ+ people face inside prisons, particularly around housing issues. Although prisons claim to take seriously the safety of the people they confine — CoreCivic's website highlights that they operate “safe facilities” — the people inside tell a very different story.

Instead, people inside are organizing to protect themselves. Bishop and Atticus are both part of an LGBTQ+ group called Be the Change, which has about 35-40 members in the prison. Be the Change is fighting within the facility for the ability to ensure that LGBTQ+ people are housed safely, setting an example for prisoner organizing nationwide.

The “Pod” System

Contemporary prisons in the United States are generally arranged into several sub-units. Within these large institutions, prisons are subdivided into units and what are known as “pods.” According to prison architects, pods offer a “pie-shape” (as opposed to a straight line of cells) and foster both community and more efficient oversight. People living within a pod together share a common room and other daily living activities, and resident experiences in different pods within the same prison can be very different.

At South Central, units have two pods, each with 60 two-person cells. Two units in particular, Columbia and Discovery, are notorious for being chaotic, violent, and controlled by gangs. The culture of the pod is not only important for a person's everyday well-being, but when it comes to pods and especially cellmates, it is a critical matter of physical safety as well.

“It's difficult enough dealing with being locked up on your own, but when you have to go home at night to a little bitty box with someone who you do not get along with, that just makes it all the more complicated.”

“It's difficult enough dealing with being locked up on your own, but when you have to go home at night to a little bitty box with someone who you do not get along with, that just makes it all the more complicated,” said Atticus, who has faced harassment over his bisexual identity.

Having a bad cellmate can be dangerous, even life threatening. Tavaria “Varia” Merritt, a trans woman also imprisoned at South Central, says she has often been called to offer support for LGBTQ+ people after sexual assaults in the prison, including for folks at risk of suicide.

Safety is a major concern for everyone in prison, but LGBTQ+ people face unique and heightened risks. Department of Justice statistics show trans people in prison experience sexual violence at more than 12 times the rate of other people in prison. Physical violence, too, is elevated. And LGBTQ+ people are also locked up at higher rates.

Alex, a program facilitator for Be the Change who is pansexual, says the fear from being in a bad pod or having a bad cellmate deeply impacts quality of life for people like him. Describing his own struggle arriving to the prison a year ago and feeling targeted, he says the fights and close calls make you wonder how many chances you have left before something is fatal.

“That's quite a bit of dread to live with,” Alex told Truthout, describing loss of appetite from the depression. He says constant mistreatment from anti-queer podmates “makes you feel like less than a person.”

Queer Folks Strive to Protect Each Other

Into the gap left by CoreCivic steps Be the Change. The group is impressive in its scope, holding weekly meetings organized under the umbrella of the Unitarian Universalist church and organizing a wide variety of classes, including crochet and music, that support LGBTQ+ people in exploring their identities, finding kin, and building community.

The group organizes meals together and holds large events, like its 10th anniversary celebration in July 2025, with speakers and guests from both inside and outside the prison community. Be the Change's founder Merritt speaks regularly at trainings for prison staff about the needs of LGBTQ people inside.

Merritt and Be the Change are a powerful force at South Central mitigating the effects of the chaotic institution on LGBTQ+ people in the facility. Several members spoke to Truthout about how their housing crises were resolved by the group's advocacy.

On his first day in the prison, Atticus says he went to the cell he was assigned by administration. When he got there, his new cellmate, who was gang-affiliated, simply told him he wasn't living there. In gang-controlled areas of the prison, it's common practice to demand “rent” from any unaffiliated people.

“So I was pounding the pavement trying to find a place to live,” he narrates. “And that's when I ran into Varia and Be the Change. And they got on that problem so quickly, it surprised me. She moved heaven and Earth to find a place for this complete stranger, me. And by the end of the night, I had somewhere to lay my head and I've been there ever since.”

Some Be the Change members, Merritt says, have been sent to solitary confinement after refusing to accept a cell assignment with someone who was openly hostile to LGBTQ+ people. When she talked to Truthout, Merritt estimated there were five or six people in the hole (another term for solitary) for this reason.

In story after story, Be the Change members describe a complete lack of help from staff in the prison for housing problems. Bishop points out that 134 people “count out” — a form of attendance taking — within his pod at the end of the day, which only has a capacity of 120, indicating the problem is no secret to guards.

Victor, a gay man and vice president of Be the Change, says staff would “deliberately put people who they knew would have problems with me” in his cell.

Atticus describes this as a tension between bureaucratic reality and material reality, which are often “completely divorced.” Staff, says Atticus, are generally only concerned with making sure that “bureaucratic reality” makes sense. As long as things look good on paper, staff seem unconcerned about the conditions people are living in.

Sources also report rampant theft of their belongings from inside their cells, and believe this is accomplished with help from guards letting people into the cell and ignoring who lives there and who doesn't.

Worse than indifference, Victor, a gay man and vice president of Be the Change, says when he arrived to South Central before Be the Change's founding, what he experienced was an “institutional level of homophobia.” He says at that time staff would “deliberately put people who they knew would have problems with me” in his cell.

PREA Is Insufficient and Even Aggravates the Problem

In prisons across the U.S., LGBTQ+ people struggle with the danger that a hostile cellmate can present. Many have advocated for and sometimes worked with the wardens of their facilities to create LGBTQ+-specific pods to reduce this danger and create an environment that is less hostile to trans women and queer men, which is what Merritt says she'd like to see at South Central. Just as often, it seems, prison administrators determine that an LGBTQ+-specific unit or pod is discriminatory. Specifically designated pods in a prison also make it harder to fill the entire prison to capacity.

Merritt says Be the Change negotiated a policy at their facility called “Cell with Care” that mandated trans people be placed following a specific consultation process to ensure a smoother match. Recently, however, Merritt says the facility has stopped following it, and it is unclear why. (Truthout attempted to obtain a copy of this policy but did not receive timely responses from either the Tennessee Department of Correction or CoreCivic during the course of reporting.)

The federal Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) is supposed to mitigate some of these risks, particularly the increased risk of sexual victimization, by offering a set of guidelines that includes rules around with whom people can be housed and when they must be consulted. According to Advocates for Trans Equality, PREA standards indicate that “LGBT people may be housed in separated, dedicated housing units only if such placement is voluntary or is based on a case-by-case assessment that includes other factors; if the unit also houses other groups of vulnerable individuals; or if the unit was established as part of the resolution of a lawsuit to protect LGBT people.”

Prism reports that the Trump administration issued a memo on December 2, 2025, ordering auditors to ignore key PREA standards related to trans and intersex people. The legal status of these changes is still undetermined, but PREA is already a deeply flawed source of support for LGBTQ+ people. Particularly problematic is that queer and trans people are more likely to be criminalized with sex offenses because of anti-queer biases prior to coming to prison as well as inside of it.

Merritt says Be the Change negotiated a policy at their facility called “Cell with Care” that mandated trans people be placed following a specific consultation process to ensure a smoother match. Recently, however, Merritt says the facility has stopped following it.

PREA is also liable to be used in a retaliatory manner by fellow people in prison as well as by staff. Be the Change members explain that everyone inside has a “PREA compatibility status” of either victim, aggressor, or neutral. These statuses determine who can be housed together; for example, a victim cannot be housed with an aggressor. While this may seem to be protective, Victor told Truthout, “I think the worst thing you can have as far as your PREA status is being a victim, because it's so difficult to find a roommate.”

These statuses lend themselves to being weaponized. Victor says that in some cases, he and others have awoken in the morning to find their status changed overnight, without warning and for no apparent reason. These changes disturb the housing situations that people have been able to find for themselves.

In interviews with Truthout, sources at South Central implied that people do not want to name that they've been sexually assaulted because it will complicate their housing situation.

Self-Organization Can Only Go So Far Within the Carceral System

Be the Change and self-organized groups like it in prisons across the United States are finding ways to care for themselves and others, as the state refuses to house and care for those it has forced into its custody.

Be the Change members emphasize how lucky they feel to have found Merritt and her group. “I'm safe and I don't have to worry about these things that other people have to worry about because I know that I have a community who cares about me,” Atticus said of his struggle to find safer housing within the prison.

“I started this to form a safe haven for those who will be considered prey in prison,” said Merritt. “Forming [Be the Change] has changed so many lives for the better. The constant fears of being raped and the constant fears of being assaulted and abused by other inmates and staff … that has been replaced with friendships and the ability to live an authentic life even behind the bars.”

Victor, who has been part of the group since the beginning, highlighted how Be the Change has successfully changed the culture at South Central in the last 10 years. But he also named some of the difficulties of doing this kind of work from within a system that is organized by violence from top to bottom. Sometimes, he said, Be the Change's attempts to work in respectful ways makes it even harder for them to assert their dignity without violence.

Ultimately the group can't solve housing problems without at least some cooperation from the prison. Rather than asking for more support from the prison, Merritt and Be the Change are asking for the prison to simply follow its own stated policies and to allow the group to do the work it is already doing.

Within a context where the group's work is constantly derailed, Be the Change stands out as an example of how people in prison struggle to care for each other.

Angela Henderson, a member of Southerners on New Ground who supports Be the Change from the outside, said, “I think the conditions are just getting more and more scary … but at the same time, they're still like finding ways to still be Be the Change. Holding the potlucks and making sure everyone's needs are met.”

In the last weeks, we have witnessed an authoritarian assault on communities in Minnesota and across the nation.

MOSCOW, February 16. /TASS/. The negotiations in Geneva on the Ukrainian settlement will cover a broader range of topics compared to the rounds in Abu Dhabi, with all major issues to be discussed there, including those concerning territories, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov reported.

TASS has compiled the key information about the upcoming contacts and preparations for them.

- The negotiations will take place at Geneva's InterContinental Hotel, a source told TASS.

- The Russian delegation for the upcoming negotiations in Geneva will be expanded. In addition to Presidential Aide Vladimir Medinsky, it includes Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin and the Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff, Igor Kostyukov, Peskov announced.

- According to him, Medinsky remains the head of the Russian negotiators' delegation on Ukraine; he did not participate in the rounds in Abu Dhabi because those focused specifically on security issues.

- The Russian delegation will consist of approximately 20 people, a source told TASS.

- Visas have already been approved for all members of the Russian delegation for the trilateral talks in Geneva, he clarified.

- According to the source, US representatives pressured the Swiss authorities to ensure the prompt issuance of visas to all members of the Russian delegation and to guarantee flight clearance for the negotiations.

- RDIF CEO Kirill Dmitriev will take part in the Geneva negotiations, but he is working on a separate track - within the group on economic cooperation with the US, Peskov stated.

- Russian President Vladimir Putin is in constant contact with the negotiators on the Ukrainian settlement. The head of state gave the Russian delegation detailed instructions before their departure for Geneva, Peskov stated.

- The negotiations in Geneva on the Ukrainian settlement will cover a broader range of topics compared to the rounds in Abu Dhabi. All major issues will be discussed there, including those concerning territories, Peskov reported.

- The first round of trilateral security consultations involving Russia, Ukraine, and the US took place on January 23-24 in Abu Dhabi.

- The Russian negotiating group was led by the Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff, Igor Kostyukov.

- On February 4-5, the second round of trilateral negotiations between Russia, the US, and Ukraine was held in Abu Dhabi.

- Following this round, US Presidential Special Envoy Steve Witkoff announced that Moscow and Kiev had agreed on an exchange of 314 prisoners of war.

- Discussions covered "economic aspects, the territorial issue, and a ceasefire mechanism," a source told TASS.

Experts say discounts on IVF procedures an attempt to fulfil campaign promise but savings only a fraction of total cost 

TrumpRx, the US president's much-anticipated drug discount program, went live earlier this month with coupons available for just 43 medications, including four required for in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures, and experts say this is probably a half-measure to fulfill Trump's 2024 campaign promise to make IVF treatment universally accessible.

“We've been hearing about TrumpRx for a long time,” said Dr Richard Paulson, a professor of reproductive medicine at the University of Southern California. “TrumpRx was supposed to fix all of the problems in terms of prescription drug costs and so on, and it has not done that. The only two classes of drugs that are actually cheaper on Trump RX are the GLP-1 agonists – those are the obesity medications – and fertility drugs.”

There is a search function on the TrumpRx website, but most Americans are unlikely to type in their prescription medications and see results. Medications for fertility, weight loss and menopause are overrepresented. Patients can print out coupons from the TrumpRx website or add them to their digital wallets, similar to other discount services like GoodRx.com. The White House has said additional drug discounts will become available on the platform in coming months.

But the fertility drug coupons only account for a fraction of the cost of IVF treatment, says Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Although patient circumstances, location and insurance mean that the calculation is different for everyone, Tipton says “pharmaceutical costs are typically 10 to 20%” of the total cost of IVF, which also includes expenses like egg retrieval procedures that require sedation.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates that TrumpRx discounts will save patients up to $2,200 per IVF cycle, but each cycle can cost as much as $30,000 out of pocket. Many clinics recommend that patients plan to undergo as many as four cycles, as each one only carries a 30% chance of resulting in pregnancy and live birth.

The Heritage Foundation, the religious conservative thinktank that authored Project 2025, an agenda that has had extensive influence on Trump's second-term policies, is generally opposed to IVF, framing opposition as part of the “pro-life” agenda. Tipton said it did not logically follow that opposition to abortion means opposition to IVF.

“Pregnancy termination and pregnancy creation are very, very different things,” Tipton said. “However, if you have built your opposition to pregnancy termination on the fiction that a fertilized egg is the same as a baby, then IVF is dangerous to you.”

Tipton suspects that the Heritage Foundation's influence has prevented Trump from taking further steps to expand IVF access. In its January report, entitled “Saving America by Saving the Family: a Foundation for the Next 250 Years”, Heritage Foundation writers argue that embryos are “sacred human beings” and that IVF is therefore ethically questionable, as not all embryos created in the process survive.

In an op-ed, Paulson wrote that the Heritage Foundation's framing ignores the reality that even in the course of natural reproduction, most embryos never become children.

Some of the medications listed on TrumpRx could be used either for IVF or for what the Heritage Foundation has labelled “restorative reproductive medicine (RRM)”, which Paulson said is a scientifically dubious term.

“It's deceptive,” Paulson said, because the philosophy behind RRM “is that you need to be restored”.

By this logic, “infertility is not a disease, it's a manifestation of other problems, and you need to fix those problems, and when you do, your infertility will go away”, he said, likening this to other Make America Healthy Again (Maha) logic, such as the idea that diet can fix chronic illnesses.

“Eat meat, right? If you just eat red meat, everything's going to get better,” Paulson quipped, in reference to the health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's refrain about the benefits of protein.

The health department did not respond to a request for comment about TrumpRx and its fertility offerings.

Alternatives to IVF, like intrauterine insemination (IUI) with fertility drugs, can lead to unwanted results. For example, IUI raises the risk that patients will become pregnant with twins or even more babies at once, which in turn raises the risk of pre-term births and other related problems.

Still, Heritage Foundation analysts have stated that they can accept IUI, so long as it only involves the sperm and egg of a married man and woman, while remaining hostile to IVF.

Paulson supports individual patients' right to make medical decisions based on faith, but does not think faith should guide medical policy: “If you start with the Bible and see that as the truth, and then you filter everything through that prism, then you're going to come up with different conclusions than those people that are just looking at the science, and that's the problem.”

Workers decried John Paulson's plan after billionaire painted himself as advocate for domestic manufacturing

John Paulson, a hedge fund billionaire and one of Donald Trump's earliest Wall Street backers, is planning to offshore an Ohio manufacturing plant to China despite heavy pushback from employees.

Workers at the plant call the move “a slap in our face”, after Paulson vocally defended domestic manufacturing, and are fighting to keep the plant open.

Conn Selmer, the largest US manufacturer of brass and orchestra instruments, told the union it planned to offshore most work at its Eastlake, Ohio, plant to China by the end of June 2026, eliminating 150 jobs.

United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 2359, which represents the 150 employees, said workers were informed of the closing when it first sat down to bargain over their new union contract last month.

“We came in with a full proposal, fully prepared to bargain, and they started off with a presentation of telling us how bad we were doing,” said Robert Hines, president of UAW Local 2359 and an employee at the plant. The company told them there would be no bargaining and the plant would be closing.

Workers say offshoring is an attack on the union, citing rhetoric that the plant has not been productive despite previous praise from company management.

Union workers say Conn Selmer opened a facility in China last year and gradually shifted their workload to that plant, though workers were told the new facility would not affect workload in Ohio.

“Almost immediately they started taking parts from certain product lines,” Hines said. He noted co-workers began complaining about brass metal coming from China that had to be scrapped due to poor quality.

Paulson made a significant portion of his wealth by betting against the housing market that crashed in 2008. A longtime Trump donor, he served on Trump's economic policy team during his first presidential campaign and raised $50.5m for the president at his Palm Beach home in April 2024. He was in the running to serve as secretary of treasury during Trump's second term but withdrew because of “complex financial obligations”.

Paulson, like Trump, has publicly criticized offshoring. “We can't have American producers closing American factories and offshoring. We need to protect American jobs and protect American manufacturing,” he said during an interview with CNBC in September 2024.

Hines said offshoring the brass plant would be deeply offensive to workers after Paulson painted himself as an advocate for domestic manufacturing.

“To go publicly on CNBC to support the Trump administration's positive views on tariffs and all that stuff, and then you turn around and [say you] want to go send the work right over to China,” Hines said. “It's a slap in our face.”

But the union intends to keep fighting. Hines noted he hopes Trump steps in to stop the decision. “This decision can still be reversed,” he said.

In early February, the union held a rally in Eastlake, Ohio, as part of efforts to save the plant from closing. It also released a video featuring workers at the plant criticizing the proposal to shut down the plant.

“It really pisses me off,” said one worker in the video. “It leaves a hole in your heart,” said a second. “I feel betrayed,” added another.

“They tell us we are the beating heart of this company,” said a worker in the video.

The White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

A spokesperson for Conn Selmer did not comment on the criticisms from the union, though the company confirmed that if the “tentative decision is finalized”, it will transfer some instrument production offshore.

The plant's closure “will improve our competitiveness and better meet today's market demands”, the company said. “We remain deeply committed to US manufacturing, as we have been for more than 150 years.”

Workers are especially worried about the impact the plant's closure will have on the community.

“It's going to take a lot of money out of Eastlake,” Hines said. “We've had people come out [and] show love to try to keep the place open, and the company just isn't open to it. They're not answering or returning anyone's calls.”

Files show convicted sex abuser messaged with Ken Starr and others about Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford

Jeffrey Epstein sympathized with Brett Kavanaugh during the then-supreme court nominee's contentious 2018 confirmation and even suggested Republicans should have been harder on Christine Blasey Ford, who had accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault.

Emails and text messages released by the Department of Justice show Epstein was closely monitoring the confirmation and seemed to believe that Ford's allegation of sexual assault could derail the process.

Epstein told one person, whose name was redacted, on 22 September 2018 “Ive sat in Kavanaugh chair. Im thinking of November.” The meaning of the November reference is not clear.

Epstein called the pending judiciary hearing “a trap!”, adding “Iye [sic] been through many of these. MANY!! She will cry, make sordid allegations. Say she feels bullied, fearful, traumatized. Every thing bad in her life was s result of the rape attempt. Suffered anxiety! Her relationships with men etc. this is a very special skill set needed.”

Ford, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University who grew up in the Washington DC suburbs, delivered gripping and harrowing Senate testimony on 26 September 2018, in which she alleged under oath how a “visibly drunk” Kavanaugh had pinned her on a bed, groped and ground against her, and tried to take off her clothes during a gathering in the summer of 1982. Both were teenagers.

Ford said she believed Kavanaugh was going to rape her, and covered her mouth to muzzle her screams before both toppled over and she was able to escape the bedroom. Kavanaugh denied Ford's allegations. The all-male Republican senators judiciary committee had appointed a female prosecutor, Rachel Mitchell, to essentially cross-examine Ford, a decision that Epstein called a huge mistake.

He wrote to an unidentified person on 27 September 2018: “horrible choice of prosecutor woman. critical and maybe lethal mistake. . prosecutors don't cross examine. they prosecute.. power on their side . she should have been a criminal defense attorney.”

He then rattled off a series of questions he seemingly believed Ford should have been asked instead, including whether there was a “history of anxiety” in Ford's family, whether lights were on in the bedroom, if Ford had seen Kavanaugh again, and probing how Ford got away from the party.

Ford had introduced her testimony by explaining that she could not recall certain details of that day, but that the alleged assault was clear in her memory. In another message, Epstein said Ford should have been asked about how “therapist notes” allegedly differed from her account.

Asked about her view of the messages, Lisa Graves, a Democrat who formerly served as chief counsel for nominations at the Senate judiciary committee, said it was “appalling to see a sexual predator weighing in this way against a woman who courageously testified about a man at the precipice of one of the most powerful posts in the country”.

“It is shocking in part because you have this person who was at the center of efforts to abuse young women and girls and you have an adult woman testifying how she was allegedly treated by Kavanaugh and his friend, at an age when she was still a girl,” Graves said.

There is no evidence in the files that Kavanaugh knew or met Epstein. But Epstein was in frequent contact with Kenneth Starr, the late former US solicitor general and independent counsel who led an investigation into Bill Clinton's relationship with then-intern Monica Lewinsky and other scandals. Kavanaugh served as an associate to Starr during the investigation into Clinton.

Starr, who died in 2022, was a close personal friend and professional contact of Epstein, and was the key lawyer who helped Epstein clinch a plea agreement in 2008, which is how Epstein avoided federal sex-trafficking charges and served a reduced sentence.

On 23 August 2018, Epstein appeared to ask Starr about a report that was to be released about Kavanaugh and the Starr investigation. Starr responded: “No writing for now. The release should be a non-event for Brett. I get criticized in one portion of the report, but no finding of illegality.”

On 26 August 2018, Epstein wrote to Starr and said he had just read the Kavanaugh “disclosure”, which Epstein said reminded him of “what a genius” Starr was at his job. It is not exactly clear what Epstein was referring to, but about a week earlier, on 20 August 2018, a memo released by the National Archives and Records Administration provided new details about Kavanaugh's role on Starr's team during the Clinton investigation. Kavanaugh's memo said Starr's team had a responsibility to “make [Clinton's] pattern of revolting behavior clear”, and included a list of graphic sexual questions he thought Clinton should be asked.

A few weeks later, on 17 September 2018, Kathy Ruemmler, who said this week she would step down as general counsel of Goldman Sachs in June, sent Epstein a note asking whether he saw that “Beth W” was representing Kavanaugh, a reference to Beth Wilkinson.

Earlier emails seem to also indicate that Kavanaugh was Epstein's favorite to be nominated by Donald Trump. Epstein and Starr traded messages about it on 4 July 2018, days before the news was official, and Epstein called Kavanaugh his “first choice”.

            Former US President Barack Obama said he's seen no evidence that aliens have made contact with Earth, clarifying his position on extraterrestrials after comments he made in a podcast went viral.
    


            Obama found himself in the spotlight over the weekend after he appeared to confirm the existence of aliens in an interview he did with US podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen.
    


            Towards the end of the interview, which dealt with a range of heavyweight issues such as the killing of protesters at the hands of immigration enforcement agents in Minnesota, Cohen posed a series of questions in a “lightning round,” starting with: “Are aliens real?”
    


            “They're real but I haven't seen them,” replied Obama. “And they're not being kept in… what is it? Area 51. There's no underground facility unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.”
    


            The second question in that round was “what was the first question that you wanted answered when you became president?,” to which Obama replied, laughing: “Where are the aliens?” The interviewer did not delve into the response, instead going straight onto the next question.
    


            Obama's answer was picked up by international media, as well as people on social media. On Sunday evening, Obama issued a statement to clarify his position.
    


            He posted the clip of his original comments on Instagram, accompanied by a short statement, saying: “I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it's gotten attention let me clarify. Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there.
    


            “But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we've been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”
    


            It's not the first time that Obama has spoken out on the issue. In an appearance on “The Late Late Show with James Corden.” He said: “What is true, and I'm actually being serious here, is that there are, there's footage and records of objects in the skies, that we don't know exactly what they are.
    


            “We can't explain how they moved, their trajectory. They did not have an easily explainable pattern. And so, you know, I think that people still take seriously trying to investigate and figure out what that is.”
    


Obama compares ICE's ‘rogue behavior' in Minnesota to dictatorships



            Conspiracy theories involving extraterrestrial life have long abounded about Area 51, a highly classified United States Air Force facility located at Groom Lake in southern Nevada.
    


            One popular UFO conspiracy is that in 1947 in Roswell, New Mexico, remains from a flying saucer that supposedly crashed were taken to Area 51 for reverse engineering experiments in order to replicate the extraterrestrial spacecraft.
    


            In June 2019, a poll conducted by YouGov found that 54% of US adults think it is likely the government knows more than it's telling about UFOs.

MOSCOW, February 16. /TASS/. Compared with the rounds in Abu Dhabi, the Geneva talks on Ukraine will cover a wider range of topics and address all key issues, including those related to territories, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.

"This time, we plan to discuss a broader set of issues, focusing on the key ones related to the territories and other demands. That is why the presence of our chief negotiator, [Vladimir] Medinsky, is required," the Kremlin spokesman explained.

The first round of trilateral security consultations between Russia, the US and Ukraine took place on January 23-24 in Abu Dhabi. The Russian negotiating team was led by Igor Kostyukov, head of the Main Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff. The second round was held in the UAE capital on February 4-5. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced that the next round of negotiations on the Ukrainian settlement will also take place in a trilateral Russian-American-Ukrainian format on February 17-18 in Geneva. According to him, the Russian delegation will be led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky.

Drawing from the Hanseatic League, a 13th-century alliance, could help middle powers leverage their strengths

Fen Osler Hampson is Chancellor's Professor at Carleton University.

Tim Sargent is director of domestic policy at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute and a former deputy minister of trade.

This essay is part of the Prosperity's Path series. In a time of geopolitical instability and a shifting world order, the challenges facing Canada's economy have only gotten more visible, numerous and intense. This series brings solutions.

Prime Minister Mark Carney won many plaudits for his recent speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in which he warned that the rules-based economic order is over, and that “middle powers” such as Canada must work together against great-power coercion. The speech continued making waves at last week's Munich Security Conference.

But talk is cheap and applause is free. And the blowback from U.S. President Donald Trump has been harsh and long-lingering. Also last week, Mr. Trump threatened to block a new Windsor-Detroit bridge and demanded to be “fully compensated for everything we have given” to Canada – despite the fact that Canada paid for the entire project. 

Without a concrete proposal for rallying the middle powers, the Prime Minister might have been better to confine himself to the usual platitudes of high-level international meetings, and to avoid antagonizing the world's most powerful country. He needs to follow up, and quickly. The “rupture” to the world order, as Mr. Carney calls it, hits a trading nation such as Canada particularly hard. Without action to back up Mr. Carney's words, our lives will get harder and meaner.

Canada, along with other advanced democracies such as Britain, Norway, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and the countries of the European Union, should look beyond traditional diplomacy. They should seek to establish a 21st-century version of the Hanseatic League: an informal alliance of hundreds of cities and merchant guilds along the North and Baltic coasts in medieval times. This group, which grew out of German towns, successfully formed a commercial and defensive network to stave off the predations of neighbouring states such as Denmark, England and Russia. 

The power of such an alliance today would come not from military strength, but from the sophisticated market-power leverage these countries exercise over global finance and trade.

A key lesson from the recent skirmish over President Trump's ambition to acquire Greenland is not just the pushback he got from some leaders at Davos; it is also the market reaction to the possibility that European creditors might start to dump U.S. bonds if the conflict escalated into a full-blown trade war. 

The true Achilles' heel of the U.S. is its exposure to its creditors and foreign investors, with its net foreign debt – public and private – now standing at more than $27-trillion, compared to only $8-trillion a decade ago. When the threat of instability begins to manifest itself as a spike in bond yields (which move inversely with prices) or a sudden decline in share prices, the economic costs of predatory behaviour are immediately apparent.

Between the sovereign wealth funds of Norway and Australia, the massive pension portfolios of Canada, Britain and many EU members, and the government bond holdings of Japan, these countries together control a critical mass of global liquidity. By themselves, each is not enough to make the United States blink. But if they were to coordinate their risk assessments, this group could act as a kind of global financial security council.

If a great power engaged in behaviour that undermines international stability through economic coercion or a violation of state sovereignty, the world's middle powers could signal their plans to recalibrate their vast financial holdings. A coordinated shift in the bond holdings or a staged reassessment of a great power's sovereign risk premium would trigger an immediate market reaction, forcing a predatory actor to reassess its geopolitical ambitions.

These countries are also large economies in their own right. Our new Hanseatic League of advanced democracies accounts for 30 per cent of world's gross domestic product (measured in U.S. dollars). This is very relevant for dealing with China, the other great power that is not afraid to menace smaller countries.

Unlike the U.S., China is a net creditor country, and so is not vulnerable to a coordinated retreat from its asset markets. However, this net asset position has been built up by chronic trade surpluses, generated by an economy that produces way more than it can consume. As a result, China would be quite vulnerable to a coordinated action to restrict its exports, which would shutter factories and lead to the kind of social unrest that the communist regime seeks to avoid at all costs.

The key organizing principle of the league should be an economic equivalent of NATO's Article 5: an attack against one is an attack against all. This collective defence mechanism would neutralize the “divide-and-conquer” strategy employed by great powers, transforming a bilateral dispute into a confrontation with a powerful and unified coalition.

As with its military counterpart, the new league should have a permanent secretariat that could war-game potential threats and responses, while maintaining continuous informal communications between central bankers, fund managers, finance ministers and political leaders.

How can Canada make this happen?

The first step would be for the Prime Minister, fresh from his Davos success, to talk to other leaders to rally them to this cause. This should not be too difficult, given their reactions to Mr. Carney's speech and how their moment of unity carried the day at the forum. Moreover, there is an existing platform off which to build: Canada has already set up the Ottawa Group, a collection of middle powers including the EU that has sought to preserve a rules-based trading system.

Mr. Carney should then bring the leaders together for an inaugural meeting that would make clear the league's willingness to use its collective economic and financial muscle. Canada could offer to host the secretariat in Ottawa and provide the necessary resources. This kind of convening role is well suited to Canada's diplomatic strengths: We were heavily involved in the creation of original postwar international institutions, such as the UN or NATO itself.

Of course, there are risks. Neither the U.S. nor China is likely to welcome such an alliance, and Canada, with its dependence on the American economy, may be particularly vulnerable. Economic and financial coercive measures also carry a cost for the states imposing them. A coordinated sell-off of U.S. bonds, for example, pushes down their value and hurts the countries selling them, too.

However, standing up for oneself always carries a price, no matter the method, and that price is small compared to the cost of rolling over. We are less dependent on the United States than Mr. Trump likes to think: The reality is that the U.S. trades with Canada not because it likes us, but because it needs our energy and raw materials.

Both President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have made it abundantly clear that they respect only strength. “Going along to get along” will simply mean an endless series of concessions. The path forward for middle powers lies in recognizing that their strength is primarily financial and economic over military. 

A fit-for-purpose Hanseatic League for the 21st century would send a strong message that power in the international system does not just reside in Washington or Beijing, but also with the world's Lilliputians.

US politicians break rank at Munich Security Conference to hit out at ‘destructive' president and urge Europe to stand up to Trump

Donald Trump's most unbridled critics at this weekend's Munich Security Conference have not been Europeans but Americans – and not just Democrats.

A few Republicans, out of earshot of the US president's favoured Fox News, have had the courage to challenge Trump's diet of tariffs and unpredictability.

The criticism ends what little remained of the tradition that the US delegation to the conference limits criticism of the commander in chief abroad.

The attacks came thick and fast as Democrats vied to disown Trump, or, in the case of Hillary Clinton, the former US secretary of state, to urge Europe that Trump's chief weapon – perceived unpredictability – can be neutered by consistent push back.

In the case of Greenland she said the resistance “worked because a critical mass of our allies said ‘no, not like, we will negotiate. We'll do this. We will do that'. There was a well-presented opposition that said No. I hope what people are understanding is that unpredictability is uncomfortable, but it is important to arrive at a response and stick with it because that affects whether a leader thinks he can proceed … With Trump the question is, don't doubt what he wants to do. Try to figure out how to stop him from doing it. Don't debate what his intention is because he is telling you what his intention is. He may or may not be able to achieve it, but that is up to forces outside of him.”

Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California, accused Trump of “doubling down on stupid”. He said: “Never in the history of the US has there been a more destructive president than the current occupant of the White House in Washington. He is trying to recreate the 19th century. He is a wholly owned subsidiary of big oil gas and coal.”

Newsom said he had been frustrated at the World Economic Forum in Davos a fortnight ago by Europe's apparent lack of understanding of what it was up against. “There is no one more skilled at exploiting weakness,” he said.

But now he felt more encouraged by Europe's response. “The one thing that Donald Trump has done that I deeply appreciate, and he has done it almost single-handedly, is to unify Europe in a profound and consequential way and I applaud Donald Trump for making that happen.”

Elissa Slotkin, the Democratic senator for Michigan whom the US Department of Justice failed to indict on charges of sedition last week, said: “It's not hidden to anyone at the Munich Security Conference – the US is going through something at the moment. Is anyone missing that?

“The fundamental question [for the agenda at Munich] is whether we are going to exert more pressure on Vladimir Putin – and because we are in a mess back home, we do not know the answer to this question … and if we stay on the merry go round it just extends the pain and suffering in Ukraine.”

She warned: “We will have to hit rock bottom before we come back.”

At one packed late-night session on Friday, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was for the first time presenting her foreign policy vision. “We are shocked at the president's destruction of our relationship with our European allies,” she said. “His threatening over Greenland is not a joke. It is not funny; it threatens the very trust and relationships that allows peace to persist. I can say unequivocally the vast majority of the US people do not want to see these relationships frayed, and they are committed to our partnerships, relationships and our allies.”

But she was the speaker most determined not to return to the past. “I don't know if we are in a post-rules-based order. It is possible we were in a pre-rules-based order and now we have an opportunity to explore what the world would look like if we upheld human rights, democracy, and trade that actually centres on working-class people instead of overwhelmingly the benefits of trade accruing to the wealthiest.”

Jeanne Shaheen, the ranking Democrat on the US Senate foreign relations committee, stressed strong support for Ukraine was a bipartisan issue inside the Senate, even if it was not in the White House. She pointed out the Senate had legislation ready to go to impose severe secondary sanctions on countries that do business with Russia.

Gretchen Whitmer, the Michigan governor warned: “Trust is built over generations and it can be lost fast. In the last 14 months we have done a lot of damage. If you say no to Canada, you say yes to China.”

A Republican in attendance, Senator Thom Tillis, echoed her, warning the law of economics tariffs were going to cause damage. Strikingly, he also challenged Lindsey Graham, one of Trump's closest Republican allies, who recently said, “who gives a shit who owns Greenland?”

Appearing at the conference, Tillis said: “The 85,000 Indigenous people in Greenland give a shit about who owns Greenland. And at the end of the day, we need to show respect.”

BUDAPEST, February 16. /TASS/. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has stated that he opposes Ukraine's fast-track admission to the European Union, citing the will of its citizens.

He also warned that his government would not change its stance on the issue, despite political attacks and interference in the Hungarian elections by Vladimir Zelensky.

"Over the past week, political attacks from Ukraine have reached a new level. Zelensky has directly intervened in the election campaign in Hungary by speaking out against the Hungarian government," Orban wrote on Facebook (banned in Russia, owned by Meta, recognized as extremist in the country).

Orban said Zelensky allows himself to make political attacks and personal insults because "Hungary does not support Ukraine's fast-track accession to the EU." By his actions, "he is essentially calling into question the sovereign decision of the Hungarian people," the prime minister added, recalling that in 2025 a majority of Hungarian citizens voted against Ukraine's accession in a nationwide referendum.

"As Prime Minister of Hungary, I am obliged to ensure that the decision of the Hungarian people is respected. I will do this again and again, regardless of whether Zelensky likes it or not," Orban assured.

Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on February 14, Zelensky went beyond the bounds of decency and made personal insults against the Hungarian prime minister. In response, Orban stated that Ukraine would not become a member of the European Union.

The Hungarian government has repeatedly warned that it will not allow Ukraine to be admitted to the EU in a hurry, arguing that such a move could create the threat of direct military confrontation with Russia and cause significant damage to the European economy.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Russian attacks on Sumy Oblast on Feb. 15 caused damage to local infrastructure and injured four people, local officials reported.

Sumy Oblast Governor Oleh Hryhoriv reported that a Russian drone targeted unspecified "medical infrastructure" in the city of Sumy overnight on Feb. 14-15, causing damage to the site. 

The attack marked the second time Russian forces targeted health care facilities this week, Hryhoriv added. 

Later in the day on Feb. 15, in the community of Okhtyrka, two women and a man were injured in a Russian attack. While a 43-year-old woman was hospitalized in the community of Velykopysarivka after a Russian attack targeted a civilian vehicle. 

While the exact weaponry used in the attack was not immediately clear, Ukraine's Air Force warned throughout the day of Russian drones targeting various communities of Sumy Oblast.

No information was available on the extent of the injuries caused.

Russia has regularly launched attacks on communities across Sumy Oblast since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. The region lies in Ukraine's northeast along the Russia-Ukraine border.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 15 that over the past week, Russia launched around 1,300 attack drones, more than 1,200 guided bombs, and 50 missiles, nearly all of them ballistic, at Ukraine. Zelensky said Russia continues to deliberately target Ukraine's energy infrastructure, including power generation facilities, substations, and the power grid, while also striking residential areas.

Dismissing any approximations to Article 5 as mere "rhetorical expressions," Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys named financial support for Ukraine's military or future EU membership as more realistic guarantees.

"A barrel bought from Russia may appear cheaper to some countries, but helps fund war and attacks on Ukrainian people. It's time to stop that war profiteering," Croatian Economy Minister Ante Susnjar said.

The 7th Corps report comes as Ukraine clings to its last positions in Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad in eastern Donetsk Oblast, both of which have mostly been occupied by Russia, Emil Kastehelmi, a military analyst with the Black Bird Group, told the Kyiv Independent.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has classified the car bombing as a terrorist attack and opened a criminal investigation, the agency said.

The strikes targeted areas where Moscow had concentrated its troops, along with a Russian communications hub and a drone control center, the report read. 



Two districts on the east bank of the Dnipro River were the most affected, leaving 1,100 residential buildings without heating, Kateryna Pop, a spokesperson for the Kyiv City Military Administration, said.



"This is a second time for the past year, when a Ukrainian woman who is a refugee and is hiding for safety in North Carolina, gets murdered by a man," said the brother of the late Kateryna Tovmash.

Russian forces attacked Ukraine with four Zirkon anti-ship hypersonic missiles, an Iskander-M ballistic missile, a Kh-31 medium-range missile, and 62 drones, of which about 40 were Shahed-type, the Air Force said.



The number includes 1,180 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

Multiple enlistment officers were hospitalized after a "group of civilians" allegedly carried out an attack on the personnel in Odesa on Feb. 15, the Odesa Oblast Regional Recruitment Center reported.

The officers were escorting a "violator of military registration" when they were confronted by an unspecified number of civilians that engaged in "aggressive physical pressure" against the officers, the recruitment center said in a Facebook post.

The group of civilians used physical force and deployed tear gas against the servicemen, causing a variety of injuries, including chemical burns to the cornea, against the officers. The attack also damage a military vehicle and cameras. 

"Instead of complying with the lawful demands of representatives of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the crowd engaged in mass obstruction of state activities in the field of mobilization preparation," the Odesa Oblast Territorial Recruitment Center said.

Specifics were not provided as to how many officers were injured or the extent of the injuries sustained. 

No arrests were reported and the full details of the incident were not immediately clear. The Kyiv Independent cannot immediately verify the details surrounding the incident.

Since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, incidents targeting recruitment officers and centers have occurred in various parts of Ukraine.

As Ukraine steps up its mobilization efforts, draft offices are often accused, at times justly, of forced conscription without compliance with fundamental civil rights and ill-treatment of conscripts.

Ukraine's Human Rights Ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, told parliament on Feb. 9 that he had received 6,127 complaints in 2025 over possible violations committed by enlistment officers. The number of complaints is nearly twice as high as in 2024, when the ombudsman received 3,312 appeals. In 2023, 514 people filed similar complaints, compared with just 18 in 2022.

Moscow has capitalized on controversies surrounding mobilization, often using propaganda to help escalate social tensions in Ukraine and further damage Ukraine's recruitment efforts.

Personnel shortages have dogged Ukraine throughout its fight against Russia. Although Ukraine adopted a major bill reforming the draft in April 2024, mobilization has slowed considerably compared to the early stages of the full-scale invasion.

In the summer of 2025, Russian forces launched several strikes on enlistment offices in the cities of Kryvyi Rih, Poltava, Kremenchuk, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhzhia, damaging infrastructure and causing civilian and military casualties.

These attacks were viewed as an escalation in tactics, aimed at disrupting Ukraine's mobilization efforts and fueling social unrest.

Tayler Heise, Abbey Murphy, Kendall Coyne Schofield and Hayley Scamurra each put a goal into the back of the net in the second period. The U.S. didn't score in the third, but didn't have to.

The 74-year-old actress told Fox News Digital she is "grateful" for her health and to still have a career in Hollywood.

Jane Seymour shared her secrets to staying fit and healthy as she celebrated turning 75. 

During a recent interview with the Daily Mail, the actress, who marked her milestone birthday on Sunday, revealed how she has stayed a size 4 since she was a teenager and detailed her approach to dieting. 

"I love the Mediterranean way of eating, it works so well, and it tastes good, it includes a lot of delicious food like tomatoes, olives and fish," the "Somewhere in Time" star said.

Seymour explained that she enjoys light breakfasts and only eats one main meal a day around 1:30pm.

"I start the day with coffee and hard-boiled eggs for protein, and it isn't till later, around lunchtime, that I have a full meal because then I can really enjoy it," she said. 

"I love fish and vegetables, and grow many greens in my backyard, which I love to use."

The U.K. native said her afternoon snacks include vegetables with hummus, pistachios and other nuts, noting that she prefers savory foods to sweets.

"I do love nuts," she told the Daily Mail. "I am a savory person, I like the salt."

Seymour emphasized that she doesn't believe in dieting, only in eating healthy foods that she enjoys rather than restricting herself.

"People ask me if I have a cheat day with my diet and I respond that I am never on a diet, I just make good choices and stick with them," she said.

"If you think you are on a diet, you will lose track, you will cheat," Seymour continued. "But if you find healthy foods you really love that make you feel good, you never feel shorted."

"Being healthy just feels good, it keeps me going, it gives me energy," she added. 

Seymour noted that her exercise routine includes lifting light weights and Pilates.

Seymour told the outlet that her family history has influenced her commitment to maintaining her health.

"First of all, heart disease has run in my family, so I go to the doctor and I regularly get tested to see where I'm at and what I need to do," she said.

"Meanwhile, I exercise, I eat healthy, I sleep, I try not to stress too much," she said. "So, I pay attention to it. It's very important. It's the number one cause of death for women."

"For the actual day of my birthday, I have no idea," she said. "It usually rains a lot, and it's right next to Valentine's Day, so I might do what the Queen of England used to do and just have my official birthday on another day, when the sun is shining and we can all be outside."

Seymour also reflected on aging, telling Fox News Digital that she feels like she is "in my prime right now."

"I'm grateful to have amazing work, work with great people who I love," the "Harry Wilde" star said. 

"Oh gosh, I don't even have time for everything I'm doing right now, it's insane," she added. "Mercifully, I have the energy for it. But I'm just so grateful, I really am."

"I never ever imagined I'd be doing what I'm doing right now at this age, ever."

ATLANTA (AP) — The NAACP and other organizations are asking a judge to protect personal voter information that was seized by the FBI from an elections warehouse just outside Atlanta.

Georgia residents entrusted the state with their “sensitive personal information” when they registered to vote, and the Jan. 28 seizure of ballots and other election documents from the Fulton County elections hub “breached that guarantee, infringed constitutional protections of privacy, and interfered with the right to vote,” the organizations said in a motion filed late Sunday.

The motion asks the judge to “order reasonable limits on the government's use of the seized data” and to prohibit the government from using the data for purposes other than the criminal investigation cited in the search warrant affidavit. That includes prohibiting any efforts to use it for voter roll maintenance, election administration or immigration enforcement. 

They also want the judge to order that the government disclose an inventory of all documents and records seized, the identity of anyone who has accessed the records outside of those involved in the criminal investigation, any copying of the records and all efforts to secure the information.

The Department of Justice did not immediately respond Monday to a request for comment on the motion.

FBI agents arrived at the elections hub just south of Atlanta with a search warrant seeking documents related to the 2020 election in Fulton County, including: all ballots, tabulator tapes from the scanners that tally the votes, electronic ballot images created when the ballots were counted and then recounted, and all voter rolls. The county has filed a motion seeking the return of the seized materials. 




President Donald Trump has fixated on Fulton, a Democratic stronghold and the most populous county in the state, asserting without evidence that widespread voter fraud there cost him victory in Georgia in 2020. 

An FBI agent's affidavit presented to a magistrate judge to obtain the search warrant says the criminal investigation began with a referral from Kurt Olsen, who advised Trump as he tried to overturn his 2020 election loss and now serves as Trump's “director of election security and integrity” with a mission to investigate Trump's loss.

The motion was filed by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law on behalf of the NAACP, Georgia and Atlanta NAACP organizations, and the Georgia Coalition for the Peoples Agenda. It notes that the seizure happened as the Justice Department has been seeking unredacted state voter registration rolls.

The Justice Department has sued at least 23 states and the District of Columbia to try to get them to hand over detailed voter information. The agency has said it is seeking the data as part of an effort to ensure election security, but Democratic officials and other critics worry that federal officials want to use the sensitive data for other purposes. Federal courts in several states have rejected the Justice Department's attempts to get the records.

“These repeated efforts to access 2020 election records, including by the entity that now has custody of them, heightens concerns about the privacy and security of sensitive voter data and exacerbates the chill on voting rights,” the motion says.

A 21-year-old hiker died after slipping off the trail near the summit of Mount Marcy, New York's tallest peak, authorities said.

The Adirondack Daily Enterprise reported that the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) confirmed the victim, who was from New Jersey, was found dead near the summit area Thursday night. 

Officials have not released the hiker's name or gender.

The NYSDEC did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment, but a spokesperson for the state government agency told the Adirondack Daily Enterprise the hiker had called 911 at 3:05 p.m., saying they slipped and were unable to get back onto the trail.

A dog was with the victim, and it was not immediately clear whether anyone else was hiking with them or what caused the slip.

Two forest rangers tried to locate the hiker from a State Police helicopter, but heavy cloud cover around Mount Marcy's summit prevented them from making visual contact, a NYSDEC spokesperson told the outlet.

Around 6:06 p.m., one of the rangers was dropped at the Marcy Dam Outpost — roughly five miles from and nearly 3,000 feet below the summit — to begin a ground search.

The ranger then hiked toward the hiker's last known location near the summit and found the 21-year-old at 9:51 p.m., deceased, according to the spokesperson.

The dog was found alive and was led off the mountain by rangers, officials said, but poor weather conditions initially prevented crews from recovering the hiker's body.

A State Police helicopter transported two forest rangers to the site on Friday morning, where they were able to recover the hiker's remains.

"The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation offers its condolences to the family," the spokesperson said.

Australian women's tennis player Destanee Aiava announced Saturday that the 2026 season will be her last in a scathing statement about the sport posted on her social media.

Aiava, 25, described tennis as her "toxic boyfriend" in the statement posted on Instagram. She lamented being so young when she started, with her breakthrough coming when she was just 17.

She wrote that tennis gave her some of her best friends and she was able to travel to places she only dreamed of. But she said the sport "took things from me," including her relationship with her body, her family and her self-worth.

"I want to say a ginormous f--- you to everyone in the tennis community who's ever made me feel less than," her statement continued. "F--- you to every single gambler who's sent me hate or death threats. F--- you to the people who sit behind screens on social media, commenting on my body, my career, or whatever the f--- they want to nitpick. And f--- you to a sport that hides behind so-called class and gentlemanly values. Behind the white outfits and traditions is a culture that's racist, misogynistic, homophobic and hostile to anyone who doesn't fit its mould.

"Life is not meant to be lived in misery or half a--ed. My ultimate goal is to be able to wake up everyday and genuinely say I love what I do – which I think everyone deserves the chance at. I'm 25, turning 26 this year, and I feel so far behind everyone else, like I'm starting from scratch. I'm also scared. But that's better than living a life that's misaligned, or being around constant comparison and losing yourself."

Aiava, then, thanked those who supported her career.

Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot shares the latest on the investigation into the Hanukkah attack in Sydney.

The man accused of carrying out a Hanukkah terror attack in Sydney, Australia, was seen publicly for the first time Monday, appearing by video link from Goulburn Supermax prison during a hearing at Downing Center Local Court.

7NewsAustralia reported that Naveed Akram, 24, spoke only briefly during the less than 10-minute hearing as a suppression order protecting the names of some victims was extended.

"Did you hear what just occurred?" Deputy Chief Magistrate Sharon Freund asked. "Yep," Akram replied.

"Your solicitor will call you, OK?" Freund said.

"Yeah," responded the shooting suspect.

Akram has been charged with one count of committing a terrorist act, 15 counts of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder, and additional firearms and explosives offenses, according to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions website. 

The most serious charges carry potential life imprisonment.

Akram's lawyer, Ben Archbold, told reporters it was too early to indicate how his client would plead, according to 7NewsAustralia.

"There's a client that needs to be represented. And we don't let our personal view get in the way of our professional application," Archbold said.

His next court appearance is scheduled for April 8.

The 24-year-old is accused of carrying out Australia's deadliest terror attack targeting a Jewish "Hanukkah by the Sea" celebration at Bondi Beach in December. 

His father, Sajid Akram, 50, was shot and killed in a gun battle with police at the scene.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described the Bondi attack as an "ISIS-inspired atrocity," saying at a press conference at Parliament House in Canberra late last year that the government had been informed by the Office of National Intelligence of an ISIS online video feed reinforcing that assessment.

The quiet economic miracle hiding in your grocery bill.

Everything about the American economy right now feels weird. The hiring picture is weird; the stock market is weird; and AI infusion into work is very, very weird.

But here's a number that, if you think hard enough, is stranger — at least historically — than all the rest: 10.4 percent.

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

That's the share of their disposable income that Americans spent on food in 2024, according to the USDA's Economic Research Service. That's groceries, restaurants, even the occasional ill-advised 11 pm burrito delivery. And it all adds up to about a dime of every dollar.

That might sound like a lot if you've been staring at your ever-growing grocery receipt lately or when the New York Times is discovering Americans who apparently spend over a quarter of their income on DoorDash delivery. But let me put it in context.

In 1901, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics conducted its first major household expenditure survey, the average American family spent 42.5 percent of its budget on food — not on food and housing and everything else, just food. At today's median household income, that would be the equivalent of roughly $2,600 a month going to the grocery store. In 1947, Americans were still spending 23 percent of their income on groceries alone — and that was before accounting for restaurants. As recently as the 1960s, the figure for all food spending hovered around 15 percent.

The long, quiet decline from 42 percent to 10 percent is one of the most consequential economic trends in American history, one that has as much to do with Americans getting richer as it has to do with the price of food. But almost nobody talks about it.

The man who first noticed this pattern was a German statistician named Ernst Engel — and before you ask, no, not the Engels with Marx and the Communist Manifesto. Ernst Engel was born in Dresden in 1821; Friedrich Engels was born in Barmen in 1820. (The overlap has been causing confusion in econ classrooms for over a century.)

In 1857, Ernst Engel analyzed roughly 200 working-class family budgets from Belgium and noticed something striking: Poor families spent 60 to 70 percent of their income on food, while wealthier families spent under 50 percent. It seemed that the richer you got, the smaller the share that went to eating.

This became known as Engel's Law, and it remains one of the most durable empirical findings in all of economics — confirmed across countries, centuries, and every dataset anyone has thrown at it.

The reason Engel's Law matters so much is that food spending as a share of income is, in effect, a freedom index. Food comes first, and when you're spending two-thirds of your paycheck just to eat, there's almost nothing left for education, health care, savings, recreation — all the things that make life more than mere survival. As that share falls, the rest of life can open up.

All this happened not by accident, but because of one of the most underappreciated revolutions in human history: the transformation of American agriculture.

In 1940, one American farmer fed about 19 people. Today, one farmer feeds nearly 170 people. That's a nearly nine-fold increase in productivity in less than a century. In 1850, the majority of American workers labored on farms — today, it's under 2 percent. We produce vastly more food with vastly fewer people on less land.

Take corn, the backbone of the American food system. From 1866 to 1936, corn yields were essentially flat at about 26 bushels per acre. Then came hybrid corn, synthetic fertilizer, mechanization, and modern genetics. By 1950, yields had crept up to 38 bushels per acre. Today, they're above 180. That's a sevenfold increase in what one acre of ground can produce.

The result? The USDA found that real retail food prices were actually 2 percent lower in 2019 than in 1980, even before adjusting for the massive improvement in variety and quality. Americans today have access to food from every continent, in every season, at prices that would have baffled their grandparents.

And it's not just an American story, though America sits at the extreme end. Globally, the pattern holds exactly as Engel predicted: Nigerians spend about 59 percent of their consumption expenditures on food at home. Bangladeshis spend 53 percent. Chinese consumers spend about 21 percent. Americans are under 7 percent — among the lowest seen in cross-country data.

Of course, you might think that's great, but how come a dozen eggs were costing me $6 not that long ago?

Fair. Food prices rose 23.6 percent between 2020 and 2024. Egg prices spiked 8.5 percent in 2024 alone, thanks to avian flu. Beef and veal were up 5.4 percent. The post-pandemic inflation surge was real, and it hurt — especially at the lower end of the income ladder, where the lowest-earning 20 percent of households spend 32.6 percent of their after-tax income on food, compared to just 8.1 percent for the top quintile.

But here's the thing: Even at the peak of the 2022 food price panic, when headlines screamed about a “31-year high” in food spending, the share of income Americans spent on food was still lower than any year before 1991. The “crisis” was effectively a return to early-'90s prices — which themselves would have seemed miraculously low to anyone living in the 1950s.

And as Mike Konczal recently pointed out using the latest BLS consumer expenditure data, the DoorDash panic gets the story backwards. Americans as a whole are actually spending less of their budgets on food away from home than before the pandemic and more on groceries. People under 25 have shifted the most toward cooking at home.

The aggregate picture is not “Americans are blowing their paychecks on delivery apps.” It's “Americans are tightening their belts on eating out because groceries got more expensive.”

That's a real affordability concern — but it's a very different story than the one going viral on social media.

None of this means America's food system is a simple triumph. The 10.4 percent figure is an average, and averages hide things.

Start with inequality. In 2023, households in the lowest income quintile spent 32.6 percent of their after-tax income on food. The highest quintile spent 8.1 percent. That's a fourfold gap between rich and poor; Engel's Law still at work in the modern United States. Programs like SNAP and the National School Lunch Program significantly cushion the blow. SNAP alone served roughly 42 million people per month in 2023, but the underlying disparity is large and persistent.

Then, there's what cheap food is actually made of. The agricultural revolution that brought prices down also made ultra-processed foods — engineered for shelf stability, convenience, and palatability — the dominant source of calories in the American diet. The downstream consequences have been obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, and they've created costs that don't show up on your grocery receipt but absolutely show up in the health care system.

The price tag at the register doesn't include what industrial agriculture does to the land, either. American farming's environmental footprint — greenhouse gas emissions, fertilizer runoff that feeds dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico, biodiversity loss from monoculture cropping — represents a set of externalized costs that consumers never directly pay. The effect on the billions of animals raised for food, as Future Perfect has reported over the years, is unimaginably high. The food is cheap in part because the environmental and welfare bill gets sent somewhere else.

I don't want to minimize any of these serious problems, but I also don't think they invalidate the core achievement. As this newsletter points out again and again, progress and its caveats exist simultaneously. The right response is to address the caveats because the progress has given us the resources and the room to do so.

The fact that the average American family can feed itself on roughly a tenth of its income — something that would have seemed like science fiction to Ernst Engel, poring over those Belgian household budgets in 1857 — is a genuine civilizational achievement. When a society spends less on food, it frees up resources for everything else: for school, for medicine, for saving, for living. That's human freedom, measured one grocery receipt at a time.

MILAN (AP) — The trio of U.S. women targeting Olympic figure skating gold Tuesday night are not the dainty ice princesses of yesteryear. 

There's Amber Glenn, a 26-year-old powerhouse and LGBTQ+ rights activist whose career took off just when most figure skaters are contemplating retirement. The three-time and reigning U.S. champion's unvarnished opinion on everything from politics to the trading card game “Magic: The Gathering” have made her a polarizing figure at the Milan Cortina Games.

Then there's Alysa Liu, the one-time phenom who retired at 16 only to launch a comeback that resulted in the first world title for an American woman in nearly two decades. Liu's blond-and-brunette striped hair, prominent frenulum piercing and nonconformist aura have made the 20-year-old a hero of the alt, punk and emo crowd.

And there's Isabeau Levito, perhaps the closest thing to the innocent image of teen predecessors like Tara Lipinski and Sarah Hughes, right up until you get the 18-year-old away from the cameras, and her searing wit and biting sarcasm shine through.

They've dubbed themselves the “Blade Angels,” an homage to “Charlie's Angels,” after rejecting such suggestions as “Powerpuff Girls” and “Babes of Glory,” which they worried might lead to some trademark issues. (As if they needed more of those in Milan.)

They are a new kind of role model for a new generation of American girls.




They also are the last chance to salvage a disappointing Olympics for American figure skaters.

“I really like that we're all different,” Levito said, “and we all have our own strengths and personalities, and our own ways we want to look and appear. I think it's really great, because while we all have the same passion for the sport, and we have very aligned goals.”

Glenn grew up in Plano, Texas. Her father, Richard, is a police sergeant and her mom, Cathlene, a fitness instructor. She's represented the U.S. internationally for nearly 15 years, which happens to be how old Lipinski was when she won Olympic gold.

It's hard to get more unabashedly American. Yet some critics nevertheless questioned her allegiances on the eve of the Milan Cortina Games, when Glenn answered a question about the political climate for the LGBTQ+ community under President Donald Trump. 

“I hope I can use my platform and voice throughout these Games to help people stay strong during these hard times,” she said. “A lot of people will say, ‘You're just an athlete. Stick to your job. Shut up about politics.' But politics affect us all.”

Glenn probably wouldn't have taken such a bold stance a decade ago, when she nearly quit the sport.

But over the course of her career, she's tackled head-on an eating disorder, which is all-too common in the sport. She spent time in a mental health facility to get a handle on her depression. She learned to cope with ADHD. And she came to understand her sexuality; Glenn identifies as pansexual, meaning she is attracted to people regardless of sex or gender.

“I've been through a lot,” Glenn told The Associated Press. “It's taken many, many years to get to this point.”

Now, she has an Olympic gold medal from her Winter Games debut after helping the U.S. defend its title in the team event.

“I stepped away from the sport. I've come back. At one point, I hated it. Whenever people would ask me, ‘Oh, should my kids get into it?' I would be like, ‘No, never,'” Glenn said. “But I've seen the people around me grow, and how the environment of figure skating has changed, and how we're trying to change it. And in doing so, we've created an environment I like to be in every day.”

Liu is the only member of the U.S. women's team with any previous Olympics experience. But much like Glenn, she had come to loathe the sport by the time she finished sixth at the Beijing Games, so much so that she quit entirely. She was 16 at the time.

“I really hated skating when I quit. Like, I really didn't like it,” Liu told the AP. “I didn't care about competitions. I didn't care about places. I didn't care about skaters. I didn't care about my programs. I just wanted to, like, get away. I want nothing to do with that. I hated fame. I hated social media. I didn't like interviews. Like, I hated all of it.”

It took walking away for Liu to finally find herself.

The same kid who'd get dropped off at the rink by her father in the morning and picked up at night, and who thirsted for friends her age while living and training alone in Colorado, began to explore: Liu climbed to the base camp of Mt. Everest, ticked off items on her ever-growing bucket list, and enrolled at UCLA to study, perhaps fittingly, psychology.

“I learned so much. Met so many new people,” Liu said. “I had to exercise my free will and push myself in different ways.”

She began contemplating a comeback two years ago, after she went skiing and experienced an adrenaline rush unlike anything she'd felt since hanging up the skates. Liu didn't know where it would lead — certainly not the first world title for an American since Kimmie Meissner in 2006, and definitely not another Winter Games — but she knew that she loved the feeling of skating again.

Everything in Liu's life has meaning now, including the striking horizontal stripes in her hair. They're meant to represent the growth rings of a tree. There are three of them at present, and like a tree, Liu plans to add another ring each year.

“I used to feel like a puppet or a canvas that other people were using,” she said. “Now I do things for myself.”

Levito has always admired Russian skater Evgenia Medvedeva, perhaps the most dominant women's skater of the mid-2000s, who was heavily favored to win gold at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games but wound up with the silver medal instead.

“She was just so pretty. I just wanted to have that angelic energy that I feel like she has,” Levito told the AP. “Amber and Alysa have their distinct style, and she was more like me. My style is, I don't know, put together. I don't know how to word it.

“The ice princess image,” Levito said, after a long pause, “which is silly to say.”

Mostly because it is just that — an image. 

Yes, there is a sense of purity surrounding Levito, whose mother, Chiara, immigrated to the U.S. from Milan three decades ago, and whose grandmother still lives in the host city of the Winter Games. But pull her away from the TV cameras, photographers and the prying eyes of the world, and her sarcastic-bordering-on-vulgar sense of humor bubbles to the surface.

At last month's U.S. Figure Skating Championships, Levito was asked her favorite quality in Liu, who was sitting beside her. “I want to say something but I won't,” Levito said, before succumbing to a little prodding: “She keeps the hoes on their toes,” she said.

“I think it's so funny,” Levito said later, reflecting on that day. “The internet is like, ‘Our Isabeau is not a baby anymore,' when they have no idea what you're actually like. I just don't want to say the wrong things in front of the media.”

So, Levito plays it safe. She wears a sort of mask for the public, projecting the image she thinks people want to see.

Much like Glenn and Liu have people who can relate to them, there are a whole lot of people who can relate to that.

Israeli ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon joins ‘Fox News Live' to discuss skepticism about U.S.-Iran nuclear talks and the possibility of regime change as the ayatollah faces pressure from protesters.

Spike Lee was seated courtside at the Intuit Dome in Southern California for the NBA All-Star Game, but it was his outfit that caught attention during the event.

Lee wore a Pro-Palestinian look to the festivities in Inglewood, California, as the league put its new format on display, which featured World All-Stars and All-Stars from the U.S. on Team Stars and Team Stripes.

The World All-Stars featured Portland Trail Blazers forward Deni Avdija. It was the first time an Israeli-born player appeared in an All-Star Game. Avdija wore the Israeli flag on the back of his jersey for the game.

Lee didn't make any extra statement, but his outfit was enough of a message.

"I feel like when I come to play, I come with the entire nation, and it's fun to show that it's possible, even for a small country like us," he said after the game, via Times of Israel.

While political issues didn't appear to seep into the game, Houston Rockets star Alperen Sengun was asked about his relationship with Avdija on Saturday. Sengun is Turkish and the relationship between the two countries is far from strong.

"You know, I think that stuff is a lot bigger than ours. We just going to represent our country, here, you know, the best we can. Deni is the same harder worker," Sengun told reporters. "You know, great guy, great person. One of my good friends in this league.

"And like I said that stuff are a lot bigger than our stuff. We are just here doing what we love, and other stuff is out of our control. And hopefully, you know, of course basketball is the thing hopefully bring everyone love, and stay together, you know, that's what we are here for. And like I said, the other stuff is out of our control, and hopefully, you know, it's all got into peace in all world, and that's all we wanted."

            John Tateishi was just under three years old when he was sent to prison.
    


            He was never arrested or charged with a crime. But like over 120,000 other Japanese immigrants and Japanese Americans, he and his family were rounded up and sent on buses to prison camps in the West during World War II, the result of wartime paranoia and racism following Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.
    


            Now, Tateishi sees a disturbing parallel between his experience and the Trump administration's frenzied push to detain and deport thousands of immigrants, many of them Hispanic and Latino, with little due process.
    


            There are clear differences between the Trump administration's current immigration blitz and the incarceration of Japanese Americans. The contemporary immigration crackdown has involved campaigns across the country purportedly to enforce existing immigration law, while Japanese Americans were incarcerated under the guise of wartime necessity just based on their ethnicity, even when there was no accusation they had broken any laws.
    


            But there are also striking throughlines.
    


Fort Bliss, a sprawling military base in the desert in El Paso, Texas, where Japanese and Japanese American people, Italians and Germans were held during WWII, has been repurposed for the immigration crackdown. It's now home to Camp East Montana, one of the nation's largest centers for detaining people accused of immigration-related violations, where at least three people in custody have died in the last two months.
    


            The Japanese American Citizens League called the use of the facility to detain people accused of immigration violations “a disgrace to the memory and legacy of the more than 125,000 Japanese and Japanese Americans unjustly imprisoned during World War II.”
    


            Like two-thirds of the people incarcerated without charge in 10 prison camps during WWII, Tateishi, now 86, is an American citizen. So were his parents; his grandparents had immigrated to the US from Japan and built their lives in California, he told CNN.
    


Rubio says US does not know whereabouts of 137 Venezuelans deported under the Alien Enemies Act



            But the US government treated all Japanese immigrants and their descendants as suspect. The Alien Enemies Act of 1798 was used to detain foreign nationals, many of them Japanese, while Executive Order 9066 was used to detain and incarcerate people of Japanese descent from the West Coast en masse, including US citizens.
    


            In his second term, President Donald Trump invoked the same sweeping wartime legislation – the Alien Enemies Act – used to lock up Japanese nationals to expedite the deportations of Venezuelans, whom he claims were suspected gang members and criminals “invading” the US. In September, a federal appeals court ruled Trump's use of the act, which deportees say led to months of torture at a mega-prison in El Salvador before they were released in July, was unlawful.
    


            A White House spokesperson defended the president's authority “to conduct national security operations” and told The Associated Press in September “we expect to be vindicated on the merits in this case.” The case is ongoing.
    


            Satsuki Ina, who was born behind barbed wire at the Tule Lake Segregation Center, a maximum‑security prison camp in Northern California, said she identifies “completely” with what's happening today.
    


            “The similarities are profound” between the Japanese American experience and the operations targeting immigrants in the US today, the 81-year-old told CNN.
    


            “The hatred, the criminalization by race and ethnicity, the false narratives – calling people today rapists and criminals, and we were called saboteurs and spies.”
    


            Hiroshi Shimizu, 82, who spent his earliest years in multiple camps, including Tule Lake and Crystal City in Texas, said he didn't fully grasp what had been taken from him until later in life when he saw his grandchildren “going through the same ages that I was when I was in prison and all the wonderful things they're able to do being free.”
    


                    “I can now see what a terrible thing it was for me to have spent the first five years of my life in prison,” Shimizu told CNN.
                





            Decades later, the US acknowledged the imprisonment was based on “race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership” and granted reparation payments of $20,000 to each survivor.
    


            Now, according to Tateishi – who helped lead the campaign for reparations – it's as if all that progress has been undone.
    


            “It feels like everything that we've held sacred in this country, and that so many people fought for and died for, almost has no meaning,” he said.
    


            Just hours after bombs began raining down on Oahu, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, two FBI agents arrived unannounced at Nikki Nojima Louis' home in Seattle's Japantown.
    


            The agents pushed through the door and ransacked the family's belongings. They took away her father, who was born in Japan.
    


            It was her fourth birthday.
    


            “After that, we never lived together as a family again,” Louis, now 88, told CNN.
    


            Arrested alongside other community leaders, ministers and business owners as a potential security risk, Louis' father was interrogated and later sent to the Justice Department's all‑male “enemy alien” camps in Lordsburg and Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he remained until 1946, a year after the war ended.
    


            Louis and her mother were left behind in Seattle – until two months later, in February 1942, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, authorizing the mass removal of people of Japanese ancestry, including US citizens, from the West Coast. They were incarcerated at Camp Minidoka, a concentration camp in south-central Idaho, where they lived in a single room in drafty barracks partitioned by thin walls. There was a metal cot, a coal-burning stove and a bare light bulb hanging from the ceiling. Winters dropped below zero; summers climbed past 100 degrees.
    


            And similar scenes of fear and dispossession played out across the country, as Japanese Americans were forced to leave behind their homes and livelihoods and bused to remote camps.
    


            Ina's parents – both American citizens – were forced from their San Francisco home and confined to the Tanforan racetrack detention center in San Bruno. Her mother was pregnant with her older brother.
    


            After answering “no” to two questions on the government's so‑called loyalty questionnaire, the family was transferred to Tule Lake, where those deemed “disloyal” were held under tighter security. Ina was born there and, along with her family, classified as an “alien enemy,” she said.
    


            Her father later protested the drafting of young men from inside the camps to fight overseas. He was charged with sedition and sent to a federal prison in North Dakota.
    


            During their imprisonment, Ina's mother kept a diary. She wrote, “I wonder if today is the day they're going to line us up and shoot us.”
    


            Tateishi can still remember the day he arrived at Manzanar in California's Owens Valley.
    


            Over the course of three years in the isolated desert camp, he came to understand that they were in prison. “I was able to deduce that the only reason we're here is because we're Japanese,” he said. “And I didn't understand what it was we had done that caused us to be put behind barbed wire fences.”
    


Stephanie Hinnershitz, a historian at the National WWII Museum and the author of a book about the camps, told CNN the imprisonment emerged during a time of widespread prejudice against Japanese Americans and other people of Asian heritage. Immigrants were scapegoated, blamed for economic precarity and viewed as disloyal to the US, fueling legislation like the Alien Land Laws, which barred Chinese and Japanese immigrants from buying land in the US.
    


            The West Coast was declared a theater of operations by the then-War Department, which offered commander John L. DeWitt “very broad authority to start issuing curfews, and to start ordering or calling for searches and seizures of homes, even where American citizens live,” Hinnershitz said.
    


            In the crowded camp, separated from the rest of the country by miles of desert and armed soldiers, Tateishi remembers telling his brother he wanted to go to America one day.
    


            “I had this very distinct sense that America was out there somewhere,” he said. “And I had this yearning to find out what it was like.”
    


            In December 1944, with WWII drawing to an end, a Supreme Court ruling and a public proclamation paved the way for the camps to close. Japanese Americans were sent home with just a train ticket and $25 each.
    


            After their release, former detainees faced financial strife and continued anti-Japanese racism, as well as the unremitting feeling they had been betrayed by the country to which they had worked so hard to assimilate.
    


            Ina, whose US-born parents she said were “coerced” to renounce their citizenship in Tule Lake, leaving them stateless for more than a decade, said the ordeal devastated her family.
    


            “We were never charged with a crime,” she added. “We never went through a court process, and yet everything was taken from us: our freedom, our belongings, our educational opportunities, our future, a generation of wealth.”
    


            Today, the Trump administration's hardline approach to immigration enforcement has seen activists with green cards locked up for months, masked federal agents grabbing people off the street, the shuttering of programs for refugees and asylum-seekers, and hundreds of workers arrested in chaotic workplace raids. Many people detained and deported have never been charged with a crime.
    


            The president has defended his approach, saying the crackdown is “totally focused on criminals, really bad criminals.”
    


            And the Supreme Court has upheld ICE officers' ability to stop people for factors like their race, the language they speak, or their job. In one case captured on video, an agent told a man in a Minneapolis suburb he was being detained because of his accent.
    


            Ina says she sees clear analogues to today, like the “criminalization by race and ethnicity,” the “forced removal from people's homes,” and “the absence of due process,” that mirror her own experience. As Japanese American children were detained, so have immigrant children been locked up, some for months on end, in detention centers; some children, including US citizens, have been deported.
    


The children of Dilley



            Another parallel is the “dehumanizing, racist” rhetoric used by the Trump administration to discuss immigrants, according to Elora Mukherjee, a leading immigration lawyer and professor at Columbia Law School.
    


            The detention of people with green cards and other forms of legal status – as well as calls to denaturalize US citizens – also echoes the targeting of American citizens of Japanese descent, she said.
    


            So too do the lengthy detentions some people experience in massive detention centers. “We never knew, were we going to be held for a month, a week?” Ina recalled. “Nobody dreamed they would be held for up to six years.”
    


            Then there are the camps themselves. Thousands of immigrants are currently being detained in large detention centers where detainees, lawyers and activists have alleged abuse and poor conditions. The Department of Homeland Security has said that the facilities meet federal detention standards and undergo regular audits and inspections.
    


            But the most striking similarity, Ina said, is the “dehumanization of people who are just looking for a better life.”
    


            “There's very little difference, except that those folks that are crossing the border to come over here are coming here in desperation, or survival,” she added. “Most of the Japanese American immigrants came here with hope.”
    


            For both Tateishi and Ina, their childhood years in prison camps inspired a mission: To make sure no one else experiences what they did.
    


            Tateishi found his path to activism in the 1970s, as anger swelled among young former detainees about their imprisonment, which the government had yet to acknowledge as an injustice. Working with the Japanese American Citizens League, he helped lead the movement to demand $20,000 per person for the years spent imprisoned because of their ethnicity, a goal brought to fruition with the Civil Liberties Act of 1988.



            The money was symbolic, he said. The real purpose of the campaign was to draw attention to the violation of Japanese Americans' Constitutional rights.
    


                    “That was the most gratifying thing of all those years of fighting for Japanese American redress, the fact that it was a commitment to the future that we would never allow it to happen again,” he said.
                





            Tateishi continued to fight for that commitment. In the midst of systematic racial profiling of Muslims and Arabs in the wake of 9/11, he and other activists with the Japanese American Citizens League used their own experiences to highlight the injustice.
    


            Ina, meanwhile, cofounded Tsuru for Solidarity during Trump's first term, a group she described as “a Japanese American social justice organization that is protesting the current unjust incarceration of immigrants, seeking asylum and protection in our country.”
    


            They held protests outside detention centers where children were held, with traditional Japanese drumming and paper cranes – a bid to show them that people on the outside cared about them.
    


            During the president's second term, “there's much more anxiety and fear,” among Tsuru members, she said. Elder members are scared about experiencing force from police at protests, or being arrested for protesting what they see as a repetition of an old injustice.
    


            For younger Japanese Americans, many of them descendants of those incarcerated, the echoes of a traumatic family history resonate today.
    


            “When I see immigrants today being ripped from their homes, grabbed from courthouses and being transferred in shackles to be incarcerated behind barbed wire, I see my grandparents, their parents and siblings and am motivated to take action,” said Becca Asaki, whose family was imprisoned during the war.
    


            Tateishi urged people fighting the current wave of detentions and deportations to persevere. It took decades for Japanese American incarceration survivors to get a formal apology and reparations for their suffering, he noted.
    


            “What's important is people don't give up,” he said.
    


            He said his perspective “is shaped mightily by my experiences as a kid in these prisons and as someone who fought for so long for trying to make sure that we live up to our promises as a democracy, as a nation.”
    


            Ina said in her work with other survivors of Japanese American prison camps, a recurring sentiment was “the pain they felt that nobody stood up for them.”
    


            “There were no mass protests. There were no petitions,” she said. “There were individuals who helped out, but there was no outrage when we disappeared from the classrooms and our work and the farms and our neighborhoods.”
    


America is on the verge of a new type of racial reckoning



            That silence, she said, is part of the trauma.
    


            It is also what compels her now.
    


            “Today, it's really important for us especially, but for everybody, to stand up, show up, protest,” she said.
    


            Her hope has come true in some ways: Trump's second term has been marked by rallies against ICE across the country. Most recently, two fatal shootings by immigration officers last month sparked massive demonstrations in Minneapolis, where an aggressive immigration enforcement campaign brought thousands of federal agents.
    


            “We will not be silent,” Ina said. “We will not turn our backs on this repetition of our history and the lifelong legacy of trauma that continues to haunt us today.”

In a short cooking video, California chef and restaurateur Andrew Gruel demonstrates how he prepares a flat-iron steak from start to finish, detailing why flipping during searing helps develop flavor and texture.

Americans reflect on leadership, history and the men who shaped the nation on Presidents' Day. 

But beyond speeches and diplomacy, there's one thread running from the Founding era to the modern White House: steak.

Although steak was sometimes served at state dinners, it was more commonly prepared for the first family's private meals at the White House or Camp David, according to Adrian Miller, a James Beard Award-winning culinary historian and Colorado-based author.

Knowing what those dinners looked like offers a window into a president's "personality and soul," Miller told Fox News Digital. "Americans simultaneously want our president to be exceptional and a lot like us."

"Presidents become more relatable when they share what they like to eat, especially the food from their childhood," Miller added. "Americans have been annoyed with presidents who seemed to like foreign food more than homegrown specialties."

From colonial beef pies to rooftop grilling at the White House, here's how nine presidents ate their steak, according to cookbooks, memoirs, contemporary reports and historical records.

Long before modern steakhouses, America's first president reportedly favored beefsteak and kidney pie, which was a popular 18th-century Anglo-American dish, according to historical accounts.

In Washington's era, steak was often baked into savory pies rather than served as the standalone cut Americans recognize today.

Because of Washington's chronic dental issues and dentures, the softer preparation might have been more practical for him.

Roosevelt favored straightforward fare. He later played a central role in reforming the meatpacking industry after reading Upton Sinclair's iconic novel "The Jungle," helping to push through the 1906 Meat Inspection Act.

President Taft regularly ate a 12-ounce steak for breakfast, alongside toast, fruit and coffee, according to White House housekeeper Elizabeth Jaffray's published recollections.

Taft was the heaviest U.S. president — but even when he tried to diet, he just limited his steak intake to six ounces, though it was a sign of his times. 

In the early 1900s, steak symbolized prosperity during a period of expansion and industrial growth.

The earliest records of steak temperatures trace back to President Dwight D. Eisenhower, according to Miller.

"Backyard grilling was really taking off in popularity during the 1950s, so home cooks were probably more interested in doneness at that time," he said.

Eisenhower loved grilling so much that he had a grill set up on the White House rooftop, outside the third-floor Solarium, according to Miller.

Former White House Executive Chef François Rysavy wrote in his memoir that Eisenhower preferred rare steaks, and he'd cook them himself — rubbing them with oil and garlic before tossing them onto hot coals. 

President John F. Kennedy's health shaped his diet. Suffering from chronic gastrointestinal issues, he reportedly preferred simple, lightly seasoned meals. 

President John F. Kennedy reportedly favored simple, lightly seasoned meals due to his chronic gastrointestinal issues. 

Danish journalist Inga Arvad, who dated Kennedy in the early 1940s, prepared plain steak dinners for him with mild vegetables such as peas, carrots and mashed potatoes, according to archived letters.

President Ronald Reagan favored straightforward American cooking, including steak served at his California ranch, Rancho del Cielo. 

While formal White House dinners could be elaborate, Reagan reportedly preferred simple meals in private, including steak with a side of chili, according to reports.

Midway through his presidency in 1985, after doctors discovered a benign polyp and traces of blood during routine tests, Reagan was advised to avoid rare steak and other red meats.

Instead, he was urged to adopt a high-fiber, low-fat diet as he underwent further medical evaluation, according to reports at the time.

President George H.W. Bush, long associated with Texas, was known to enjoy steakhouse dining. 

During a 1992 campaign stop in Oklahoma City, he ordered a T-bone steak "charred but rare" at Cattlemen's Steakhouse, according to reports from that time.

Before adopting a largely plant-based diet, President Bill Clinton was known for enjoying steak. 

Former White House Executive Chef Walter Scheib wrote in his memoir and said in interviews that Clinton requested a large porterhouse steak with creamy béarnaise sauce and onion rings, particularly when first lady Hillary Clinton was traveling.

In March 2017, during his first Washington, D.C., dinner in office, President Donald J. Trump dined at BLT Prime in his hotel. 

He ordered a $54 dry-aged strip steak cooked well-done and served with ketchup, according to the Washington Post.

The president prefers his steak cooked so thoroughly that "it would rock on the plate," his longtime butler told The New York Times. 

"For almost every person in the world, it's totally OK to prefer your steak cooked all the way through," according to a column in Eater in 2017.

"It's totally and completely fine. Fully one quarter of America prefers their steak well done or medium-well," the piece also said. 

In 2007, Trump launched Trump Steaks, a short-lived venture with the tagline "The World's Greatest Steaks."

            As the Trump administration has sued 25 mostly Democratic state election chiefs for their voter rolls, it has also encountered quieter resistance from Republican officials who have balked at the Justice Department's demands for confidential voter registration information.
    


            At least a half-dozen Republican-led state election offices have declined the Justice Department's request for non-public voter data, which can include a voter's Social Security number, driver license ID number or current residence, according to interviews, local media reporting and records obtained by CNN and by the Brennan Center, a left-leaning think tank that researches election issues.
    


            “They can have the voter rolls. They're gonna pay for it like everybody else,” West Virginia Secretary of State Kris Warner told CNN last month, referring to the public list that can be purchased in his state for $500. “They're not going to get our personal information.”
    


            Several other Republican election administrators have provided the sensitive data but refused to sign an agreement proposed by the Trump administration that would require them to remove voters deemed ineligible by the Justice Department.
    


            In interviews with CNN about the department's voter data quest, GOP election officials expressed concerns about the administration's approach even though they're aligned with the president on other matters of election security. They said the requests conflicted with state laws prohibiting the disclosure of sensitive voter information. They questioned the reasons the administration was seeking the data. And they bristled at the idea of the federal government — rather than state or local officials — leading the task of removing ineligible voters from the rolls.
    


            The Justice Department declined to comment.
    


            The voter data crusade is one of several ways the Trump administration is trying to insert itself more directly into election-related tasks carried out by states.
    


            Trump has not let go of his unfounded fixation on mass voter fraud. He has called on Republicans to nationalize elections, installed fellow 2020 election deniers in the executive branch who are leading reviews of voting infrastructure, and the FBI recently seized 2020 ballots from Fulton County, Georgia.
    


            Republicans' objections to the department's voter data project came to head at a mid-December meeting between GOP state election officials and Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, the civil rights chief at DOJ who has been spearheading the data demands. DOJ officials rebuffed calls for adjustments to its plans for the voter information.
    


            Among the biggest sticking points was a requirement in an agreement the DOJ proposed to govern the data production that would give states just 45 days to fix issues the administration identified in their voter rolls, according to Mississippi Secretary of State Michael Watson, who ultimately handed over the data but refused to sign the agreement.
    


            “We were adamant on the idea that maintaining voter rolls should be done on the state level,” Watson, who is also president of the National Association of Secretaries of State, told CNN.
    


            Dhillon, in public remarks, has been dismissive of the state officials' concerns.
    


            “Some of the goofy responses that I have gotten from secretaries of state have included, ‘Oh, my goodness, this is highly confidential Social Security information. We can't possibly give that to the federal government,'” Dhillon recently told the conservative journalist John Solomon. “That's just silly because the federal government of course issues the Social Security numbers, and people routinely give it out on a daily basis when they go to the doctor or the DMV … that's very silly.”
    


            During the February 2 appearance on Solomon's show, Dhillon hinted that more lawsuits would be filed within one to two weeks against the recalcitrant states. No new voter roll cases have been filed since December.
    


            Election officials have pointed to state privacy laws in explaining why they cannot turn over their voters' personal information.
    


            “If we could legally comply, we would promptly do so,” Oklahoma State Election Board Secretary Paul Ziriax said in a letter to the Department this month, first reported by Oklahoma News 4 and obtained by CNN. In the lawsuits that Dhillon brought to obtain the data, some judges have already rejected DOJ arguments that the federal laws the department is relying on trump those state privacy protections.
    


            Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, citing state privacy laws, told his state's legislature this month that he did not intend to produce the data absent a court order.
    


            Alongside the legal questions about whether the department is entitled to the data are questions about its stated intentions for obtaining it. Dhillon has said the department wants to help the states “clean” their rolls, and according to a letter Warner sent the department Wednesday, the DOJ verbally communicated to his office that it wants to compare the states' list with a federal system of immigrant data known the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements program.
    


            States already have the option to voluntarily use the SAVE system to review their rolls for potential noncitizens, and many Republican officials have praised the administration for making the tool easier to use. But still, those comparisons have been rife with false positives, CNN previously reported, with naturalized citizens often wrongly identified as ineligible voters because the federal data is outdated.
    


            That reality — along with the Constitution's broader vision of elections being run at the state level — has made the 45-day removal requirement in the proposed agreement especially problematic for election officials.
    


            “You can't expect to send me a 45-day window to get this done or else,” Watson told CNN, noting that in Mississippi, removals aren't done by state officials but by county clerks. “We are going to go by Mississippi law and we are going to make sure our voter rolls clean.”
    


            Other election officials were wary that the administration might use the data for other purposes and have wondered whether the stated goal — compliance with the National Voter Registration Act mandate of “reasonable efforts” to remove voters who have died or moved — is just a pretext. The Kentucky State Board of Elections asked the department in August to explain why it needed the data, in a letter that said the board was “unclear as to how providing Kentuckians' driver's license numbers to DOJ furthers the agency's stated goal.”
    


            “They don't need the driver's license, Social Security number and date of birth to make sure that we're making a reasonable effort at maintaining our voter rolls,” a Republican elections official in another state told CNN.
    


            The official, who asked for anonymity to avoid drawing the White House's ire, floated the possibility that the data would be used for immigration enforcement or as a “cudgel” to cast doubt on the midterms if they went badly for Republicans.
    


            “If states don't give this information and then Republicans lose and they can go back and say, ‘See, it's because they didn't give us this information, so they cheated and all these illegal people that shouldn't have been voting voted,'” the official said.
    


            Initially, state officials received letters from the Justice Department seeking information last spring and summer about their list maintenance practices and data from their rolls. Many provided the publicly available information, but as summer turned into fall, follow-up letters made clear that the department was demanding the confidential data as well.
    


            A handful of Republican-led states complied without objection, but as other officials raised privacy concerns, the administration drafted the Memorandum of Understanding that promised compliance with federal privacy law while laying out the list review process that would be driven by the feds.
    


            When the letters landed in election office inboxes in December, the DOJ gave states just seven days to respond and followed up with both emails and phone calls.
    


            “If do not hear anything end of day today, the DOJ will take that as refusal to comply,” Eric Neff, now the head of the department's voting section, told Montana Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen on the day of the DOJ's deadline, according to an email obtained by the Brennan Center.
    


            As it was ramping up pressure on Republicans, the Justice Department was rolling out new rounds of lawsuits against Democratic state officials for noncompliance.
    


            “You may have seen in the news that we have sued six states earlier this week for refusing to provide their voter registration lists,” another DOJ lawyer said in a December 4 voicemail left with an official in the Idaho secretary of state's office that was obtained by Idaho Capital Sun.
    


            “And we're preparing additional lawsuits. I'd like to keep everyone out of that as much as possible. But I haven't heard anything back from you all,” the DOJ attorney, who has since left the department, said.
    


            Only two states — Alaska and Texas — have signed the memorandum, according to DOJ correspondence obtained by CNN, while about a dozen more are turning it over without entering the agreement, officials have said in court proceedings.

Hungary is buying Russian oil despite alternative supplies being available, according to a report that accuses Budapest of failing to pass down to consumers the savings it makes from buying cheap Russian fuels.
    


            Instead, the savings become profits for Hungary's largest oil company, which is part-owned by foundations linked to Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, according to the report from the Center for the Study of Democracy (CSD), a European-based public policy institute, which shared an advance copy of its analysis with CNN.
    


            The CSD analysis found that domestic fuel prices in Hungary were on average 18% higher than in the neighboring Czech Republic in 2025, even though Budapest still buys cheaper Russian oil, while Prague buys costlier non-Russian alternatives.
    


            The research undercuts Orbán's claims that continuing to buy Russian oil, despite European Union-wide efforts to phase out Russian fossil fuels, makes fuel cheaper for Hungarians. Instead, the report found, the savings are accruing mostly to MOL, Hungary's oil giant, which has seen its operating income soar 30% since Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
    


            “The dependence on discounted Russian oil has not trickled down to consumers,” Martin Vladimirov, director of CSD's energy and climate program, told CNN. “Instead the profit from reselling cheap oil goes in the pocket of the monopoly supplier MOL in the form of excess profit, which indirectly funds Orbán's state capture networks.”
    


            CNN has asked the Hungarian government and MOL for comment.
    


            After Russia launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, EU members moved to end their dependence on Russian oil and gas. The EU gave Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – three Central European countries especially dependent on Russia for their energy – an exemption in 2022 and were told to reduce their reliance as soon as possible.
    


            The Czech Republic has since stopped buying Russian oil, but Hungary and Slovakia used the EU's exemption to deepen their dependence. Last year, Russia accounted for over 92% of Hungary's crude oil imports, up from 61% pre-invasion, the report said. When the United States announced sanctions on two Russian oil giants in October, Orbán traveled to the White House to ask for one-year exemption.
    


            Although US President Donald Trump granted his ally's request, saying it had been “difficult” for Hungary to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels, since it is landlocked.
    


            But the CSD researchers said Hungary's continued purchases of Russian oil are a political choice, not a commercial or logistical necessity.
    


            “Despite full access to alternative supply routes… Hungary has deepened its dependence on Russian oil, turning a temporary EU exemption into a permanent loophole in the sanctions regime,” the report said.
    


            Hungary receives Russian crude oil through the Druzhba pipeline, which runs through Ukraine, but it is also connected to the Adria pipeline, which runs through Croatia and pumps non-Russian crude oil from the Adriatic coast.
    


            The CSD researchers said the Adria pipeline “has sufficient capacity” to meet Hungarian and Slovak demand, and that its transit fees are 1.7 times lower than those for the Druzhba pipeline, which runs through an active war zone.
    


            Russian crude oil is, however, significantly cheaper than non-Russian alternatives. The report found that, between January 2024 and August 2025, Russian crude oil was on average roughly 20% cheaper than non-Russian alternatives.
    


            But that discount has not translated into lower prices for Hungarian consumers, according to the report.
    


            Last year, average weekly pre-tax fuel prices were 18% higher in Hungary than in the Czech Republic and 10% higher for diesel, the CSD said. Even though MOL bought Russian crude at a steep discount, the researchers said the company has still sold its products at prices similar to other regional markets, causing its profits to soar.
    


            “The company's operating income rose 30% above pre-invasion levels, while three foundations linked to Prime Minister Viktor Orbán control 30.49% of MOL, enabling surplus profits to flow into some of Hungary's most influential state-capture networks,” it said. Those foundations include the Mathias Corvinus Collegium, Hungary's largest educational institution, which has close ties to Orbán's government.
    


            Before Trump granted Hungary the one-year sanctions exemption, he had berated US allies for “inexcusably” continuing to purchase Russian oil, which he said was tantamount to “funding the war against themselves.”
    


            But at a joint news conference in Budapest on Monday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the exemption was granted “as much as anything else because of the relationship” between Orbán and Trump. Rubio heralded a “golden era” of relations between the two countries, and told Orbán that Hungary's success was in the US national interest “especially as long as you're the prime minister.”
    


            The CSD report comes as Hungary gears up for parliamentary elections in April, in which Orbán will face Péter Magyar, his first credible opponent in years. Orbán has campaigned heavily on how his government has kept energy costs down, which the report calls into question.
    


            The report also undermines Orbán's claims that Hungary has no option but to purchase Russian oil. It found that Hungary's refineries are technically capable of processing non-Russian crude and have done so in the past without disruptions. The CSD also pointed to how Bulgaria and the Czech Republic, which have stopped buying Russian oil since the invasion of Ukraine, “experienced no supply shocks and maintained some of the lowest fuel prices in the EU.”
    


            The researchers recommended that the EU pass legislation proposed by the European Commission to ban Hungary and Slovakia's imports of Russian crude oil as soon as possible.
    


            “The final stage of Europe's energy decoupling from Russia is within reach. What remains is the political will to close the loopholes that continue to finance the Kremlin's war machine,” the researchers said.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Monday it completed a new housing district in Pyongyang for families of North Korean soldiers killed while fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, the latest effort by leader Kim Jong Un to honor the war dead.

State media photos showed Kim Jong Un walking through the new street — called Saeppyol Street — and visiting the homes of some of the families with his increasingly prominent daughter, believed to be named Kim Ju Ae, as he pledged to repay the “young martyrs” who “sacrificed all to their motherland.” 

In recent months, North Korea has intensified propaganda glorifying troops deployed to fight in Russia's war against Ukraine, such as establishing a memorial wall and building a museum. Analysts see it as an effort to bolster internal unity and curb potential public discontent.

Kim in recent months has sent thousands of troops and large quantities of military equipment, including artillery and missiles, to fuel Russian President Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine, as the leaders align in the face of their separate confrontations with Washington.

South Korea's National Intelligence Service told lawmakers last week it estimated 6,000 North Korean troops have been killed or wounded during their deployment in the war, but did not provide a breakdown of fatalities. The agency said last year it believed roughly 600 had died.

The spy agency believes North Korean forces are gaining modern combat experience and Russian technical support that could improve the performance of their weapons systems, according to lawmakers who attended last week's closed-door briefing.

The construction of the new street comes as North Korea prepares to open a major ruling party congress later this month, where Kim is expected to announce his major goals in domestic and foreign policy over the next five years and take further steps to tighten his control.

            Defense chiefs from two major US allies have issued a rare public plea for people across Europe to support big boosts in defense spending to deter a possible war with an increasingly westward-looking Russia.
    


            The highest-ranking officials from Germany and the United Kingdom warned that European nations “must now confront uncomfortable truths” about its security and make “hard choices” about spending in an article jointly published by The Guardian in the UK and Die Welt in Germany.
    


            “Moscow's military buildup, combined with its willingness to wage war on our continent, as painfully evidenced in Ukraine, represents an increased risk that demands our collective attention,” Germany's chief of defense, Gen. Carsten Breuer, and the UK's chief of defense staff, Air Marshal Sir Richard Knighton, wrote.
    


            “Moscow's intentions range wider than the current conflict,” the pair added, arguing that the pubic must get behind increased defense spending, even if it means other public service programs – the “peace dividend” from the end of the Cold War – might suffer.
    


            Over the past decade, member states of the European Union – of which the UK is not a member – have already doubled their defense expenditures, but more spending is needed, the defense chiefs argued.
    


            “It's clear that the threats we face demand a step change in our defence and security,” the pair wrote.
    


            “Rearmament is not warmongering; it is the responsible action of nations determined to protect their people and preserve peace,” they said.
    


            The article comes on the heels of the weekend's Munich Security Conference, where US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on Europe to assume more responsibility for its own defense after relying for decades on Washington's help as the backbone of its security.
    


            The defense chiefs' article notes that NATO leaders have already committed to spending 5% of gross domestic product on defense by 2035.
    


            “People must understand the difficult choices governments have to take in order to strengthen deterrence,” the two defense chiefs wrote.
    


            But even in their own countries, the message may be a tough sell.
    


            Only about 25% of Britons favor higher taxes to fund defense spending or cuts to public service to direct more money to arms, according to a January poll by the YouGov research firm.
    


            In Germany, only 24% of the public favors increased defense spending if other programs would suffer, according to a recent Politico poll.
    


            That skeptical public will have to be won over to achieve a key goal the chiefs put forth: “a whole-of-society approach” to defense.
    


            “Defence cannot be the preserve of uniformed personnel alone. It is a task for each and every one of us,” they wrote.
    


As Rubio tries to make amends, China looks to woo Europe



            Besides the pledge to increase defense spending, the defense chiefs said their countries are taking concrete steps to improve readiness and deterrence, with Britian building six new munitions factories and Germany repositioning troops near its eastern border.
    


            The British Defense Ministry also announced over the weekend that it will send an aircraft carrier strike group led by the HMS Prince of Wales to the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans this year “to deter Russian aggression and protect vital undersea infrastructure.”
    


            The strike group, which will include the carrier's F-35 fighter jets, will work with US, European and Canadian forces during its deployment, a ministry statement said.
    


            “This deployment will help make Britain warfighting ready, boost our contribution to NATO, and strengthen our operations with key allies, keeping the UK secure at home and strong abroad,” Defense Secretary John Healy said in a statement.

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Michael Jordan, six-time NBA champion, is now a Daytona 500 winner, too.

Tyler Reddick won “The Great American Race” on Sunday with a last-lap pass at Daytona International Speedway that sent Jordan into a frantic celebration. The NBA Hall of Famer bear-hugged Reddick in victory lane and then jointly hoisted the Harley J. Earl trophy with the 23XI Racing driver. 

Jordan, who turns 63 on Tuesday, will get a Daytona 500 ring for his birthday and made it known in victory lane he wears a size 13.

“It feels like I won a championship, but until I get my ring, I won't even know,” Jordan said.

The moment captured the message team co-owner Denny Hamlin — who finished 31st in Sunday's bid to become the third driver in history to win four Daytona 500s — delivered to 23XI employees in a team meeting ahead of NASCAR's season opener. 

“He loves his race team,” Hamlin said, adding he reminded the team of the fulfillment they saw in Jordan when Reddick won at Talladega in 2024. “I was like ‘You know, you guys understand the responsibilities you have, that you have the power to bring joy to Michael Jordan. You have that power and nobody else can do it.'

“There's nothing else that can bring him the joy that seeing what his team can do and they took it to heart.” 

Reddick, in a Toyota, led only one lap Sunday: the one to the checkered flag. He was the 25th different driver to lead a lap for a new Daytona 500 record. 




“Just incredible how it all played out. Just true Daytona madness,” Reddick said. “I've already lost my voice from screaming. Never thought I'd be Daytona 500 champion.”

Reddick, a 30-year-old from Corning, California, won for the ninth time in the Cup Series and first time since late in the 2024 season. Winless last year, Reddick was primarily focused on his infant son, who was found to have a tumor in his chest that affected his heart. Reddick opened last year with a runner-up finish in the Daytona 500. 

He snapped the 38-race losing streak by finishing one place higher Sunday and winning to start a celebration that included multiple stars of NASCAR. It included Jordan, a global icon, and Hamlin, at 45 the oldest full-time driver in the Cup Series.

Reddick is teammates with Bubba Wallace, who went to victory lane in tears after leading a race-high 40 laps before finishing 10th. Jordan wrapped his arms around Wallace from behind and spoke closely into Wallace's ear in a brief speech of encouragement.

“I don't want my emotions to take away from the monumental day they just accomplished. Happy birthday, MJ. That's a massive birthday present,” Wallace said. “I thought this was our week, the best 500 I've ever had, and come up short, sucks. 

“Led a lot of laps, lap leader, I believe. It was a good day for us, but damn. Try again next year.”

Hamlin, who drives for Joe Gibbs Racing, was involved in the final caution when he and teammate Christopher Bell collided with nine laps remaining. It set up the final push to the finish over the final four laps. 

Elliott grabbed the lead at the start of the final lap when Carson Hocevar was spun off the track. Reddick made a huge surge with an assist from teammate Riley Herbst, made contact with Elliott that caused Elliott to crash, then sailed past to give Jordan a victory in NASCAR's biggest event of the year. 

“It's stuff you dream of as a kid,” said Reddick. “Now, I definitely didn't look into the future and know that I would drive for Michael Jordan. But to be able to have someone like Michael Jordan believe in me enough, someone like Denny Hamlin.

“I'm just trying to do my best to live on the promises that I made to them and vice versa.” 

Jordan was the face of the December federal antitrust lawsuit that NASCAR settled on the ninth day of trial. The settlement changed the revenue-sharing model in the United States' top motorsports series. 

Jordan watched the win from a suite overlooking the superspeedway built by the France family — NASCAR founders and private owners — that he just beat in federal court. NASCAR chairman Jim France, who was personally a defendant in the suit, went to victory lane to congratulate the winners.

“I can't even believe it. It was so gratifying,” Jordan said of the victory. “You never know how these races are going to end. You just try to survive. We hung in there all day. Great strategy by the team, and we gave ourselves a chance at the end. Look, I'm ecstatic.” 

The victory marked a Daytona sweep for three team owners heavily involved in the trial. Bob Jenkins, who joined 23XI in suing NASCAR, opened the weekend with a victory when Chandler Smith won the Truck Series opener on Friday night for Front Row Motorsports.

Richard Childress, who testified on behalf of 23XI and Front Row and was the subject of disparaging text messages by since-departed NASCAR chairman Steve Phelps, was the winning team owner Saturday when Austin Hill won. 

Then it was time for Jordan and Hamlin, the two front-facing litigants, as they got their first Daytona 500 victory together.

“All we do is win,” shrugged Hamlin, who called the trio of weekend winners “coincidence.”

Former race winners Ricky Stenhouse Jr. and Joey Logano finished second and third as Toyota, Chevrolet and Ford each placed a driver on the podium. Elliott wound up fourth and sat dejected and in disbelief on the outside wall of the track after climbing from his car. 

“We ended up kind of getting gifted the lead ... and then at that point in time, you're just on defense. Man, that's a really, really tough place to be, truthfully,” Elliott said. “Obviously looking back, you can run it through your mind 1,000 times, do you do something different?”

ATLANTA (AP) — A weekend storm system sweeping across the Southeast brought tornado warnings to Mississippi and Louisiana, and then took aim at parts of Georgia and Florida, as people in the Northeast were finally getting a reprieve from weeks of bitterly cold temperatures.

Some of the fiercest weather in the South was reported near Lake Charles, Louisiana, where high winds from a thunderstorm overturned a horse trailer and a Mardi Gras float, damaged an airport jet bridge and flung the metal awning from a house into power lines. The damage was documented by National Weather Service employees who surveyed the area.

Power poles were snapped and toppled near the Louisiana towns of Jena, Cheneyville and Donaldsonville, the weather service reported.

No deaths or serious injuries were reported, but the damage reports came as the storm system continued into parts of south Georgia and the Florida Panhandle, which were under tornado watches on Sunday.

The storms led to some power outages across southern states, but nowhere near the massive number of outages caused by ice storms late last month in northern Mississippi and Nashville, Tennessee. By Sunday evening, a few thousand customers were still without electricity in Florida, Louisiana, Kentucky and Virginia, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks outages nationwide. 




Meanwhile, the Northeast was beginning to thaw after a weekslong stretch of uncommonly cold weather.

Boston was running nearly 7 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 14 Celsius) below average for February last week, and the city was on pace for its coldest winter in more than a decade. Boston remained cold on Sunday, but this week's forecast called for temperatures climbing into the high 30s and low 40s, which is closer to the seasonal average.

On the West Coast, much of California braced for a powerful winter storm that was expected to bring drenching thunderstorms, damaging winds and heavy snow in mountain areas. Jacob Spender, a weather service meteorologist in Sacramento, urged people to take precautions in the coming days. 

“So if they are traveling, packing winter safety kits. Anything to be prepared. This is a bigger system, and a major system,” Spender said.

Rain that began Sunday in the San Francisco Bay Area was forecast to intensify throughout the day and overnight, bringing the risk of flooding. Forecasters said the Sierra Nevada, including ski resorts around Lake Tahoe, could see up to seven feet (two meters) of snow before the storm moves through late Wednesday. 

To the south, Los Angeles area residents in some neighborhoods scarred by last year's devastating wildfires were under an evacuation warning through Tuesday because of the potential for mud and debris flows. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said she's ordered emergency crews and city departments to prepare to respond to any problems.

Apple on Monday announced that it will bring a new integrated video podcast experience to Apple Podcasts this spring.

The move comes as video viewership continues to reshape podcasting. About 37% of people over age 12 watch video podcasts monthly, according to Edison Research.

The update brings Apple Podcasts more in-line with its competitors Spotify, YouTube and now Netflix, which have increasingly leaned into video podcasting.

"Twenty years ago, Apple helped take podcasting mainstream by adding podcasts to iTunes, and more than a decade ago, we introduced the dedicated Apple Podcasts app," said Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Services, in a statement. "By bringing a category-leading video experience to Apple Podcasts, we're putting creators in full control of their content and how they build their businesses, while making it easier than ever for audiences to listen to or watch podcasts."

Within the Apple Podcasts app, users will be able to switch seamlessly between watching and listening to shows from the same feed. They can also use picture-in-picture mode and download video episodes for offline viewing.

While Apple Podcasts has supported video through RSS since 2005, those feeds were kept separate from audio versions of the same show. The new update introduces support for HLS, or HTTP Live Streaming, a streaming protocol developed by Apple that enables adaptive video playback and greater controls within the app.

The new HLS format also introduces dynamic video ad insertion. Creators who distribute through participating hosting providers and ad networks will be able to insert video ads, including host-read spots, into episodes.

Apple said it will not charge creators or hosting providers to distribute content. However, it will charge participating ad networks an impression-based fee for delivering dynamic video ads through HLS.

These launch podcast hosting partners include Acast, Amazon-owned ART19, Triton's Omny Studio and SiriusXM who will all be supporting HLS video.

The announcement comes as competitors continue investing in podcast video. YouTube said last year it has more than 1 billion monthly active viewers of podcast content on its platform. Spotify has also expanded its video podcast offerings and said it paid more than $100 million to podcasters in the first quarter of last year.

Netflix has also entered the video podcast space. The streaming platform inked a deal with Spotify last year to bring video podcasts to Netflix and has begun investing in original video podcast programming, including "The Pete Davidson Show," which launched in January.

Apple does not break out revenue specifically for Apple Podcasts, but its Services segment, which includes digital content and subscription businesses, generated $30 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter.

In January, the company acquired Israeli artificial intelligence startup Q.ai for an undisclosed amount. The company has not released details of the acquisition, though Q.ai's website indicated it was working on audio-focused AI tools.

A crisis over contaminated baby formula has grown with product recall after recall in recent weeks. On Friday, Paris' public prosecutor said it opened investigations into five companies that make the formula. Parents and investors are on edge.

The investigation concerns possibly contaminated infant nutrition products distributed by three of the world's largest dairy groups, Nestle, Danone, and privately-held Lactalis, as well as smaller brands Babybio and La Marque en Moins. 

The recalls were due to possible contamination of cereulide, a heat-stable toxin that can cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea when consumed. While symptoms typically resolve within a day, it can lead to more severe complications.

The Paris prosecutor said it opened its investigations due to "deception regarding goods posing a danger to human health," an offence punishable by up to seven years in prison and a fine of up to 3.75 million euros ($4.45 million), according to a translated statement. CNBC reached out to the companies mentioned for comment.

In January, Nestle CEO Philipp Navratil said he was sorry about the worry and disruption this has caused parents and customers. "Let me reassure you that your safety and wellbeing is our highest priority," he said. 

The prosecutor's office took up the case due to the large number of complaints across the country, it said.

In addition, the French health ministry is looking into three reported baby deaths in cases where consumption of infant formula affected by the recall was reported. On Feb. 11, it said that no causal link had been established and that judicial investigations are underway.

Nestle published a "sequence of events" on Jan. 29, saying it found traces of cereulide in batches of some of its finished products in early December in its factory in the Netherlands. 

On Dec. 10, it informed Dutch authorities, the European Commission and potentially impacted countries of potential risks, according to the company's timeline, which added it initiated recalls the same day of all batches produced: 25 products in 16 countries in Europe.

In January, the Swiss company issued its first major public recall for brands SMA, Beba and Little Steps across Europe, and recalls by French peers Danone, the maker of best-selling Aptamil and Cow & Gate, and Lactalis followed. 

So far, there have been recalls in over 60 countries.

The contamination source has been traced back to an ingredient supplier of arachidonic acid (ARA) oil, which is often added to baby formula, Nestle said.

The fallout has grown over time because many different companies and multiple brands used this supplier. The supplier hasn't been officially named. The UK's Food Standards Agency said the supplier of the ARA oil was no longer being used by Nestle or Danone

It still urged parents and caregivers to check if the formula products they have at home were among those batches listed in the recalls.

On Feb. 2, the European Food Safety Authority set a threshold level of the toxin cereulide. There hadn't previously been a harmonized standard because of its rarity, said Barclays analyst Warren Ackerman.

Earlier this month, UK authorities said they had received at least 36 clinical reports of infants showing symptoms consistent with cereulide poisoning.

Nestle's infant formula makes up about 5% of revenue, and the company has disclosed that recalled products represent only about 0.5% of revenue. "The larger 5% number is probably more relevant given the likely consumer confusion and brand equity risk," said Bernstein analyst Callum Elliott in January. 

"For Danone, infant formula is more important, comprising around 21% of group revenues by our estimates, and more than this in terms of profitability."

Nestle and Danone are both slated to report earnings later this week, where investors hope to get a better picture of the financial impact of the recalls.

As investors worry about the financial fallout and potential reputational damage, Nestle shares are up 1.7% year-to-date, while Danone stock has shed 5.5%. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index is up 4.6% over the same period.

Nestle and Danone stocks slumped at the end of January, at the height of the recall announcements, but have since recovered some of their losses.

Every job, when you boil it down, is simply people talking to other people. 

As a career coach, I've advised professionals at all career stages. From what I've seen, the people who get ahead the fastest know how to communicate in a way that truly gets people to listen. 

You may not realize it, but the language you use could be standing between you and what you want. 

Here are five simple language swaps that can help you succeed, forge meaningful relationships, and demand more respect at work.

You're always going to face moments where you have a question you're not quite sure how to ask. 

Maybe you want to work from home, take a sabbatical, or get an extra week of vacation for your honeymoon. Because these are high-stakes situations, most people walk into the conversation radiating anxiety, cornering their opponent, or blurting out a closed-ended, yes-or-no question.

But making an open-ended ask can take the pressure off both parties and invite a dialogue about a process, priority or norm. It makes you look thoughtful, rather than entitled. 

Whether it's a typo in a Slack message or you're running 15 minutes late to an important meeting, missteps happen. 

Genuine apologies are necessary at times, but over-apologizing often backfires. Research has found that habitual, unnecessary apologizing can erode how others perceive your competence and confidence. 

But it can also feel awkward not to acknowledge small mistakes, so I recommend replacing unnecessary apologies with gratitude. 

The word "but" often negates everything that comes before it. Whenever you're stating two things that are equally valid, I encourage you to replace "but" with "and." 

The "and" version of these examples doesn't minimize either statement. It allows two things to be true at once, promoting greater nuance and clarity. 

"I feel like" can come across as gentle, soft, and humble, which are all wonderful things to be. But in a professional setting, it can soften your message to the point where it can be easily dismissed. It frames your professional observations as personal emotions. 

In a work environment where data and clarity carry weight, that framing can work against you. Here's what you can say instead:

Questions that begin with "why" can put people on the defensive. Even if unintended, "why" often implies judgment, asking someone to justify their choices or thinking.

When someone feels like they need to defend themselves, the conversation stops being collaborative and starts being adversarial. Instead, invite your conversation partner to walk you through their thought process, rather than demanding they explain themselves.

Ultimately, when you make these shifts, the person you're talking to will feel more heard and respected — and will be more willing to have an honest conversation with you as a result.

xAI is facing an exodus of top employees.

Two cofounders and at least eight other employees have announced their departures from Elon Musk's AI startup in the past few days, with the billionaire telling xAI's workforce in a Tuesday all-hands that the company was restructuring as it continues to grow.

In a post on X, Musk wrote that xAI had been reorganized "to improve speed of execution."

"This unfortunately required parting ways with some people," he wrote, adding that xAI was still "hiring aggressively."

It comes after Musk announced that xAI would merge with his rocket company, SpaceX, in a deal the billionaire said would help the joint entity build a network of AI data centers in Earth's orbit. I

In the Tuesday all-hands, which was posted on X, Musk said the combined company would aim to build a "self-sustaining" city and a catapult, or mass driver, on the moon to launch AI data center satellites into space.

SpaceX is reportedly gearing up for a massive public offering later this year that could value the company at as much as $1.5 trillion. That could be a major boost for xAI, which reportedly burned through billions of dollars last year.

The departures are the latest turmoil to hit the startup since Musk founded xAI in 2023 with the aim of taking on Google and OpenAI.

Since then, around half of the company's cofounders have left, and xAI has faced global backlash over sexual images of real people generated on X by Grok, the startup's AI chatbot.

Here's everyone who has left xAI in the company's most recent exodus. Business Insider has contacted each of the following employees for comment.

xAI cofounder Tony Wu announced his resignation from the company on February 9. In a post on X, the former Google researcher said it was time for his "next chapter" and thanked Musk for "the ride of a lifetime."

Business Insider's Grace Kay previously reported that Wu began reporting directly to Musk last year and led xAI's reasoning efforts.

Jimmy Ba became the second xAI cofounder to announce his departure from the company in less than 48 hours.

The executive, who previously oversaw the startup's AI tutoring efforts, also thanked Musk for the opportunity and said he was proud of what xAI had accomplished in a post on X.

Ba's departure means that six out of the 11 cofounders who launched xAI with Musk in 2023 have now left the company.

Hang Gao, a member of technical staff, also announced in an X post on February 10 that he had left xAI.

The Berkeley alumnus, who worked on xAI's Grok Imagine AI video generator, described his time at the company as "unique and memorable."

Vahid Kazemi, a member of xAI's technical staff, said on X on February 11 that he had left the company a few weeks prior. "That was short! IMO, all AI labs are building the exact same thing, and it's boring. I think there's room for more creativity," he wrote, adding that he was starting "something new."

Kazemi joined xAI last year and, before that, worked at OpenAI. He also previously worked at Google and Apple.

Ayush Jaiswal worked on Grok at xAI and announced on February 6 that it was his last week at the company. "Will be taking a few months to spend time with family & tinker with AI," he wrote in a post on X. Jaiswal joined xAI in September 2025, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before that, he was head of growth at Scale AI.

Shayan Salehian said on February 7 that he was leaving after a seven-year stint across Twitter and X to build something new.

He worked on the X timeline as well as various Grok models, he said in a post on X. He added that he is leaving to work on something "focused on accelerating science."

"Working closely with Elon across X and xAI, I saw what happens when you refuse to accept impossible as an answer," he wrote on X.

Simon Zhai, a member of the xAI technical staff, joined the company in October 2025 and announced his departure on February 9.

"Today is my last day at xAI, feeling very fortunate about the opportunity. It has been an amazing journey," he wrote in a brief departure post on X. Before xAI, Zhai was a research scientist at Google DeepMind.

Member of technical staff Andrew Ma wrote in an X post on February 11 that he had left xAI this week.

Ma worked on X's recommendation system and was "solely responsible" for writing a new version of the platform's user search algorithm, according to his LinkedIn.

The former Twitter engineer praised xAI's "wartime mentality" and thanked Musk for "creating this org that the world needs."

Radhakrishnan Venkataramani wrote in an X post on February 12 that he had left xAI this week.

The former Google and Facebook engineer joined xAI last July, per his LinkedIn, and worked on reasoning and reinforcement learning systems for Grok, as well as the company's coding model.

In his farewell post, Venkataramani said he was "grateful" to have been part of xAI, calling the company "the most hardcore team ever."

Rahul Ravishankar, a member of technical staff at xAI, said February 13 was his last day at the company.

The Berkeley graduate, who joined Musk's AI startup last year, wrote on X that leaving xAI was "one of the hardest decisions" he had ever made.

In this article

China's rapid advancement in AI is threatening to shake up U.S. dominance in the market, with one analyst warning of a tech shock that is just getting started. 

Rory Green, TS Lombard's chief China economist and head of Asia research, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Monday that America's "perceived monopoly" on tech and AI has been broken by China. 

"I think the China tech shock is just getting started. It's not just AI, DeepSeek, and electric vehicles. China is moving up the value chain very rapidly... It's the first time in history that an emerging market economy is at the forefront of science and technology," Green said in a conversation with CNBC's Steve Sedgewick and Ben Boulos. 

China is pairing dominant-market level tech with emerging-market production costs, backed by its massive supply chain, Green said. He added that with Xi Jinping being like a "tech bro" that is chucking money into these sectors, it makes for a powerful mix that  is really rapidly accelerating the China tech story.

Indeed, Beijing quietly launched a 60.06 billion yuan ($8.69 billion) national AI fund last year, and has an initiative called "AI+" which will see the tech integrated across its economy, industries, and society.

China is quickly catching up to the U.S. in the AI arms race, developing highly advanced models powered by homegrown chips, particularly through massive Huawei chip clusters and abundant low-cost energy. 

While U.S. chip giant Nvidia is viewed as the gold standard for semiconductors used to train AI models, Huawei is narrowing the gap by deploying larger volumes of chips and leveraging cheaper power to scale compute.

TS Lombard's Green explained that a "China tech sphere" could easily form, as the world's second-largest economy's low-cost tech offerings may be more attractive to developing economies. 

"China is a top trade partner for most of the world, particularly in emerging and frontier economies. What happens if that repeats on tech?" Green said.  

Developing economies that don't have a national security issue with China have a choice between "low-cost China tech, Huawei, 5G batteries, solar panels, AI, probably some cheap RMB financing," or "high-cost American and European alternative," he said. 

"For these economies, I think the choice is fairly simple, and you could see easily a world where maybe most of the world's population is running on a Chinese tech stack in five to 10 years time," he added. 

Additionally, Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, one of the world's leading AI labs, told CNBC in January that China's AI models might be just "a matter of months" behind U.S. and Western rivals and are closer to those capabilities than "maybe we thought one or two years ago."

U.S. hyperscalers Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet recently announced capital expenditure of up to $700 billion on AI this year, which raised alarms about returns and caused $1 trillion to be wiped from the market caps of tech giants. Some stocks have since pared their losses.

Karim Moussalem, Selwood Asset Management's chief investment officer, told "Squawk Box Europe" on Monday that there's a lot of "nervousness around U.S. exceptionalism," especially after the sell-off in the U.S. software sector earlier this month. 

"When I think of the hyperscalers' capex, we're seeing a race that's on and a lot of money being spent, and more and more question marks around whether you know all that investment, all that capex, is going to result in meaningful return on investments," Moussalem said. 

"I think that's really what's driving this big question mark about the U.S. versus China, and whether the U.S. will be the winner in that race. But for the time being, there's a lot of capital being spent, actually a lot more than even what was expected a few months ago, with more and more question marks about the ROI," he added.

A handful of very wealthy people want to give your children free money.

This July, the government will officially launch "Trump Accounts," a new investment savings account for children.

Parents can contribute up to $5,000 per year to each of their kids' accounts, while employers can contribute up to $2,500 per year.

For children born between 2025 and 2028, the federal government will provide a $1,000 seed contribution.

But it's not just the government. Several wealthy individuals have pledged to make further philanthropic contributions to the accounts.

Many of those individuals are "adopting" specific states, meaning their contributions are limited to children living in those states.

The accounts can't be accessed for withdrawals until the child turns 18, at which point they can spend the money on major purchases like tuition or a down payment on a home.

The goal of it all: getting the next generation invested in capitalism and building wealth.

Here's who's pouring money into Trump Accounts, and which children are eligible.

Dell CEO Michael Dell and his wife Susan have pledged to contribute $6.25 billion to the Trump Accounts of children across the country.

Specifically, the Dells are contributing $250 to 25 million children, including those who are 10 years or younger and live in a ZIP code where the median income is $150,000 or less.

Recipients also must be born before January 1, 2025, meaning the Dells' contributions will go to children who aren't set to receive the $1,000 contribution from the federal government.

"Together we can make possibility something that every child can count on," Michael Dell said in a December video announcing the contribution.

Hedge fund manager Ray Dalio is "adopting" the state of Connecticut.

The Bridgewater Associates founder and his wife Barbara are planning to contribute $250 to the Trump Accounts of about 300,000 children across the state.

The contributions will be initially targeted toward children under the age of 10 who live in a ZIP code where the median income is less than $150,000.

"Barbara and I believe strongly in the importance of equal opportunity and believe this initiative is an important step in that direction," Dalio said in a statement in December. "I have lived the American Dream. At an early age, I was exposed to the stock market, and it changed my life."

Brad Gerstner, the CEO of Altimeter Capital, is adopting the state of Indiana.

He's planning to contribute $250 to the Trump Accounts of all children under 5 years old in the Hoosier State, adding up to a figure that a spokesperson estimated to be in the "tens of millions" of dollars.

Gerstner, the founder and CEO of the Invest America Foundation, is also widely credited with coming up with the idea for Trump Accounts.

He told Business Insider in December that he helped coordinate the Dells' massive $6.25 billion contribution, and that his phone was "blowing up" when the news broke.

Harold Hamm, the founder and chairman of the petroleum company Continental Resources, plans to "adopt" the state of Oklahoma, according to the Treasury Department.

The details of Hamm's planned contributions have not yet been made public, and spokespeople for Continental Resources did not respond to requests for comment.

Hamm, a billionaire, contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to President Donald Trump's campaign in 2024.

Even Nicki Minaj says she's contributing to Trump Accounts.

Minaj has indicated that the contributions will go to her fans, but it's not clear how much money she's pouring in.

The New York Post reported in January that it could be "between $150,000 and $300,000," but that the number was still in flux. A representative did not respond to a request for comment.

Minaj said on an episode of The Katie Miller Podcast that she became interested when she saw President Trump speaking about the accounts alongside Michael Dell.

"I was just like, wow. Like, I love this idea," Minaj said.

"My big thing is financial literacy," she added. "You could teach a person everything in the world, but if they don't know how to manage money, if they don't know what the financial world really entails, then they'll get it and lose it."

Corporate resignations rarely make news, except at the highest levels. But in the last two years, a spate of X posts, Substack open letters, and public statements from prominent artificial intelligence researchers have created a new literary form — the AI resignation letter — with each addition becoming an event to be mined for meaning. Together, the canon of these letters — some of them apparently bound by non-disclosure agreements and other loyalties, legally compelled or not — tells us a lot about how some of the top people in AI see themselves and the trajectory of their industry. Overall, the image is bleak.

This past week brought several additions to the annals of "Why I quit this incredibly valuable company working on bleeding-edge tech" letters, including from researchers at xAI and an op-ed in The New York Times from a departing OpenAI researcher. Perhaps the most unusual was by Mrinank Sharma, who was put in charge of Anthropic's Safeguards Research Team a year ago, and who announced his departure from what is often considered the more safety-minded of the leading AI startups. He posted a 778-word letter on X that was at times romantic and brooding — he quoted the poets Rainer Maria Rilke and Mary Oliver. Opining on AI safety, his own experiences working on AI sycophancy and "AI-assisted bioterrorism," and the "poly-crisis" consuming our society, the letter had three footnotes and some ominous, if vague, warnings.

"We appear to be approaching a threshold where our wisdom must grow in equal measure to our capacity to affect the world, lest we face the consequences," Sharma wrote. "Throughout my time here, I've repeatedly seen how hard it is to truly let our values govern our actions."

Sharma noted that his final project at Anthropic was "on understanding how Al assistants could make us less human or distort our humanity" — a nod, perhaps, to the scourge of AI psychosis and other novel harms emerging from people overvaluing their relationships with chatbots. He said that he didn't know what he was going to do next, but expressed a desire to pursue "a poetry degree and devote myself to the practice of courageous speech." The researcher ended by including the full text of "The Way It Is" by the poet William Stafford.

In the annals of AI resignations, Sharma's missive might be less dramatic than the boardroom coup that ousted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman for five days in November 2023. It's less troubling than some of the other end-of-days warnings published by AI safety researchers who quit their posts believing that their employers weren't doing enough to mitigate the potential harms of artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a smarter-than-human intelligence that AI companies are racing to build. (Some AI experts question whether AGI is even achievable or what it might mean.)

But Sharma's note captures the deep attachments that top AI researchers — who are extremely well-compensated and work together in small teams — feel to their work, their colleagues, and, often, their employers. It also exposes some of the tensions that we see cropping up again and again in these resignation announcements. At top AI labs, there's an intense competition for resources between research/safety teams and people working on consumer-facing AI products. (Few, if any, public resignations seem to come from people on the product side.) There are pressures to ship without proper testing, established safeguards, or knowing what might happen when a system goes rogue. And there's a deep sense of mission and purpose that can sometimes be upended by feelings of betrayal.

Many of the people who have publicly quit AI companies work in safety and "alignment," the field tasked with making sure that AI capabilities align with human needs and welfare. Many of them seem very optimistic about AI, and even AGI, but they worry that financial pressures are eating away at safeguards. Few seem to be giving up on the field entirely — except perhaps Sharma, the aspiring poet. Either they jump ship for another seven-, eight-, or nine-figure job at a competing AI startup, or they become civic-minded AI analysts and researchers at one of a growing number of AI think tanks.

All of them seem to be worried that either epic gains or epic disasters lie ahead. Announcing his departure from Anthropic to become OpenAI's Head of Preparedness earlier this month, Dylan Scandinaro wrote on LinkedIn, "AI is advancing rapidly. The potential benefits are great — and so are the risks of extreme and even irrecoverable harm." Daniel Kokotajlo, who resigned from OpenAI, said that OpenAI's systems "could be the best thing that has ever happened to humanity, but it could also be the worst if we don't proceed with care."

Recently, xAI, where co-founder Elon Musk is notorious for tinkering with the proverbial dials of the Grok chatbot, has seen a half-dozen members of its founding team leave. But the locus of the AI resignation letter, as a kind of industry artifact, is the red-hot startup OpenAI, where major figures, including top executives and safety-minded researchers, have been leaving for the last two years. Some resigned; some were fired; some were described in the press as "forced out" over internal company disputes. Seven left in a short period in the first half of 2024.

With revenue paling compared to its massive and growing infrastructure costs, OpenAI recently announced that it would begin incorporating ads into ChatGPT. That caused researcher Zoë Hitzig to quit. This week, she published a resignation letter in the Times, warning about the potential implications of ads becoming part of the substrate of chatbot conversations. "ChatGPT users have generated an archive of human candor that has no precedent, in part because people believed they were talking to something that had no ulterior agenda," she wrote. But, she warned, OpenAI seemed prepared to leverage that "archive of human candor" — much as Facebook had done — to target ads and undermine user autonomy. In the service of maximizing engagement, consumers might be manipulated — the classic sin of the modern internet.

If you think you are building a world-changing invention, you need to be able to trust your leadership. That's been a problem at OpenAI. On November 17, 2023, Altman was dramatically fired by the company's board because, it claimed, Altman was "not consistently candid in his communications with the board." Less than a week later, he performed his own boardroom coup and was reinstated, before consolidating his power. The exodus proceeded from there.

On May 14, 2024, OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever announced his resignation. Sutskever was replaced as head of OpenAI's superalignment team by John Schulman, another company co-founder. A few months later, Schulman left OpenAI for Anthropic. Six months later, he announced his move to Thinking Machines Lab, an AI startup founded by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, who had replaced Altman as OpenAI's interim CEO during his brief firing.

The day after Sutskever left OpenAI, Jan Leike, who also helped head OpenAI's alignment work, announced on X that he had resigned. "OpenAI is shouldering an enormous responsibility on behalf of all of humanity," Leike wrote, but the company's "safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products." He thought that "OpenAI must become a safety-first AGI company." Less than two weeks later, Leike was hired by Anthropic. OpenAI and Antrhopic did not respond to requests for comment.

At OpenAI, departing researchers have said that the experts concerned with alignment and safety have often been sidelined, pushed out, or scattered among other teams, leaving researchers with the sense that AI companies are sprinting to build an invention they won't be able to control. "In short, neither OpenAI nor any other frontier lab is ready, and the world is also not ready" for AGI, wrote Miles Brundage when he resigned from OpenAI's AGI readiness team in 2024. Yet he added that "working at OpenAI is one of the most impactful things that most people could hope to do" and did not directly criticize the company. Brundage now runs AVERI, an AI research institute.

Across the AI industry, the story is much the same. In public pronouncements, top researchers gently chastise or occasionally denounce their employers for pursuing a potentially apocalyptic invention while also emphasizing the necessity of doing that research. Sometimes they offer a "cryptic warning" that leaves AI watchers scratching their heads. A few do seem genuinely alarmed at what's happening. When OpenAI safety researcher Steven Adler left the company in January 2025, he wrote that he was "pretty terrified by the pace of AI development" and wondered if it would wipe out humanity.

Yet in the many AI resignation letters, there's little discussion of how AI is being used right now. Data center construction, resource consumption, mass surveillance, ICE deportations, weapons development, automation, labor disruption, the proliferation of slop, a crisis in education — these are the areas where many people see AI affecting their lives, sometimes for the worse, and the industry's pious resignees don't have much to say about it all. Their warnings about some disaster just beyond the horizon become fodder for the tech press — and de facto cover letters for their next industry job — while failing to reach the broader public.

"Tragedies happen; people get hurt or die; and you suffer and get old," wrote William Stafford in the poem that Mrinank Sharma shared. It's a terrible thing, especially the tones of passivity and inevitability — resignation, you might call it. It can feel as if no single act of protest is enough, or, as Stafford writes in the next line: "Nothing you do can stop time's unfolding."

When Alyson Isaacs joined Meta in 2022, she only had about $200 in her savings account. A six-figure salary offered a chance to rebuild her finances, but her ultimate goal lay outside Big Tech.

After college, Isaacs "completely drained" her savings on a startup she'd co-founded, and found herself grappling with her next career move. After weighing her options, she decided to follow the advice of a mentor: go to "startup rehab" — in other words, take a full-time job.

"You can always get a job at a Big Tech company,'" said Isaacs, who's 28 and lives in San Francisco.

About four months later, she landed a product manager role at Meta in the company's Quest for Business virtual reality division. But her entrepreneurial itch never left, and she eventually began mapping out the best path back into the startup world.

"There are ways you can be entrepreneurial," she said of working at Big Tech, "but it's very much not the same."

Over the past year, I've interviewed more than a dozen workers who, like Isaacs, chose to quit their jobs at major employers — in some cases without another role lined up. While some eventually landed at another large company, others stepped away from the corporate world entirely — joining a smaller business, launching their own venture, pursuing a career pivot, or focusing on personal priorities like parenting.

They've become outliers in an economy where workers are quitting at one of the lowest rates in the past decade — a trend driven by a hiring slowdown that's left some clinging to their jobs with few appealing alternatives. Those who have called it quits told me they did so for a mix of reasons: concerns about job security, shifts in workplace culture, entrepreneurial ambitions, or a desire for more meaningful work. In short, they wanted greater long-term agency over their careers.

Isaacs shared how she decided to take the leap back into entrepreneurship — and offered advice for others facing a similar career crossroads.

After leaving her post-college startup, Isaacs took a month to reset. She then spent two months interviewing at smaller companies to fine-tune her résumé and sharpen her interview skills. Eventually, she applied for a role at Meta and landed the job. She moved from the Berkeley area to San Francisco and started in May 2022 — about a year after graduation.

While Isaacs didn't have firm plans to return to entrepreneurship, she knew that if she ever went down that path again, she'd need to be financially prepared for life without a steady paycheck. So she started living well below her means, including living in a less expensive area, going to a basic gym, cooking at home, and avoiding shopping sprees.

"I saved so hard because I knew that this wasn't going to be the end game for me, and I wanted to start my own thing again eventually," she said.

Isaacs also prepared for a potential return to entrepreneurship by spending about five hours a week angel investing, which involved scouting and backing startups. After about a year of saving, she began making a few investments, each under $10,000. She said the experience helped her build a network in San Francisco's startup scene and spot gaps other entrepreneurs could exploit — insights that helped shape her own business ideas.

The final phase of Isaacs' preparation was soaking up everything she could from her time at Meta, including transitioning to a product manager position at Instagram — one of Meta's subsidiaries — in 2024. She said the roles gave her knowledge and experience that entrepreneurship alone couldn't provide.

"Traditional entrepreneurship was just flying by the edge of my seat and seeing what worked," she said. "But I needed that level of expertise to go farther in my career."

The question was when to make the leap and leave Meta. Isaacs said the death of her father in 2024 weighed heavily on her thought process.

"That really triggered this thought in my brain of, 'Is being a product manager at a Big Tech company what I want to do for the rest of my life?'" she said. "And the answer was resoundingly no — I wanted to do something on my own and prove myself."

By mid-2025, Isaacs found herself thinking more and more about a startup idea in the consumer AI space — and struggling to focus on her job at Meta. On July 1, she resigned; the next day, she began working full-time on her startup, which she described as an "agentic AI solution for personal wellness." The company is currently in stealth, meaning the team isn't publicly sharing full details while the product is still in development. She said she and her two co-founders are testing the product with users and plan to open a pre-seed funding round in the spring.

Isaacs said she knows many people might hesitate to give up a Big Tech job. But she believes some underestimate their chances of finding a new role or building something themselves — and end up stuck in jobs they don't enjoy.

"It's kind of like dating," she said, adding that if you anticipate a bad dating pool, "you're going to stay with your bad ex."

Isaacs said she wasn't worried about resigning from Meta, in part because she's a "super optimist" about her career. If her startup doesn't work out, she's confident in her backup plan — the same one she relied on after her post-college startup opportunity fell through.

"Leaving Meta wasn't scary for me because I was like, 'I can always get another job in Big Tech,'" she said.

Isaacs has a few pieces of advice for other aspiring entrepreneurs. She recommends connecting with as many people as possible who are relevant to the venture you want to pursue — and looking for ways to help them, whether through angel investing, advising, or offering support.

"You kind of create this flywheel of people helping you if you help other people first," she said.

Additionally, even if your end goal is to build a business, Isaacs said having experience at a big-name company can give you valuable credibility as an entrepreneur.

"I needed to be undeniable as a founder, and having a big-box name brand on your résumé gives you that undeniability," she said.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio provided comforting words for Europe on Saturday at the Munich Security Conference. 

"We want Europe to be strong," he said. "We believe that Europe must survive, because the two great wars of the last century serve, for us, as history's great reminder, that ultimately, our destiny is, and will always be, intertwined with yours."

That's a stark contrast from U.S. Vice President JD Vance's criticism of European democracy during the previous year's security conference, and his observation then that a schism had emerged between the continent and America. 

"The retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United State of America," Vance said.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" that Rubio's speech emphasized the importance of the U.S. and Europe working together again — as both successfully did so in the past.

Elsewhere, the U.S. consumer price index on Friday stateside also provided some balm. Consumer inflation for January rose 2.4% on a year-on-year basis, lower than the 2.7% in December, and returning to where it was after President Donald Trump fired off tariffs globally in April 2025. Core CPI came in at 2.5%, the lowest since April 2021. Economists were expecting 2.5% for both figures.

"This should be welcome news for markets, and the presumptive incoming Fed Chair Kevin Warsh," said Phil Blancato, Osaic chief market strategist. "This is only one month's worth of data, but if the trend continues it should pave a path for lower interest rates and reined in inflation."

U.S. markets, however, on Friday made only tentative steps in either direction, perhaps still unsure of where to move amid uncertainty about the effects of AI on companies. All major indexes ended the week in the red. U.S. markets will be closed Monday for Presidents' Day.

Japan's economic expansion disappoints. Fourth-quarter gross domestic product rose 0.1% from the previous three months, missing expectations of a 0.4% expansion in a Reuters poll of economists. However, it reverses the third quarter's 0.7% contraction, meaning that Japan's economy avoided a technical recession.

Cryptocurrency payments to suspected human trafficking syndicates surged 85% in 2025, with hundreds of millions of transactions traced on public blockchains, according to a Chainalysis report. The blockchain analytics firm said most of the activity was linked to an expanding criminal ecosystem in Southeast Asia.

TikTok's U.S. joint venture sees it user base stabilize. Early narratives of a mass user exodus prompted by service outages and censorship concerns now appear overstated, according to new figures.

The S&P 500 was mostly flat, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.22% on Friday. Asia-Pacific markets were mostly closed on Monday for the Lunar New Year holiday. 

[PRO] The U.S. dollar is losing its safe-haven status because of risks in AI stocks, said George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank. Opportunities outside the U.S. are also driving investors away from the greenback.

Markets brace for more AI noise and 'scare trading'

AI disruption jitters have ripped through global stock markets over the last couple of weeks, with sectors across the spectrum ending up in the crosshairs of investors looking to bet on which industry could be upended by the inevitable wave of agentic AI.

There will almost certainly be more of these moments this week, as some of the biggest names in AI take to the stage at the AI Impact Summit in India. Headliners include Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Microsoft's Brad Smith, Mistral AI co-Founder Arthur Mensch and Meta's Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang.

European markets closed higher on Monday, as investors digested the key points from this year's Munich Security Conference.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 was up 0.1% by market close, with major bourses and most sectors in the region in positive territory. 

Trading of Dassault Systemes shares were briefly halted Monday after the company fell sharply. The pause came as broker AlphaValue cut its rating from Buy to Reduce amid renewed concerns over AI monetization and a "worrying loss of momentum" at the French software group. Its shares were 10% lower by the end of the trading session. 

Geopolitics and defense returned to the spotlight as investors focused on this year's Munich Security Conference. The event saw several European leaders and policymakers reiterate the need for greater defense spending to accelerate the continent's strategic autonomy, with discussions of a common nuclear shield.

Despite U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio striking a markedly more conciliatory tone towards European allies in his speech Saturday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz acknowledged a "deep divide" in the transatlantic partnership, warning that the post-World War Two rules-based order "no longer exists."

Also speaking at the MSC, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country would be ready to join the EU by 2027, and said a date for accession should be included in any peace agreement with Russia.

Meanwhile, U.K. lender NatWest Group gained 4.7% as it began a £750 million ($1.02 billion) share buyback program on Monday.

Elsewhere, European mining stocks saw some of the biggest moves to the downside in morning dealmaking. 

Rio Tinto lost 1% after the multinational mining company suspended work at its Simandou iron-ore mine in Guinea following a fatality at the SimFer project late Sunday.

Ahead of its latest earnings update Tuesday, BHP Group fell 0.7%, while Glencore, which had been set to merge with Rio Tinto until the tie-up was abandoned earlier this month, also lost ground, falling over 0.3%.  Fresnillo retreated 1%, and Anglo American was 0.2% lower.

The FTSE Industrial Metals and Mining Index was last seen down nearly 0.6%.

In corporate earnings, Airbus, Nestlé and Renault are among the names reporting results later this week.

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei advanced 0.2%, as economic growth in the country came in at 0.2% annualized for the December quarter, lagging an expected 1.6% print. Trading was thin elsewhere in the region, as markets in China, South Korea and Taiwan were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday.

Stock markets in the U.S., meanwhile, are closed on Monday for Presidents' Day.

Chinese tech giant ByteDance has said it will strengthen safeguards on a new artificial intelligence video-making tool, following complaints of copyright theft from entertainment giants. 

The tool, Seedance 2.0, enables users to create realistic videos based on text prompts. However, viral videos shared online appear to show copyrighted characters and celebrity likenesses, raising intellectual property concerns in the U.S. 

"ByteDance respects intellectual property rights and we have heard the concerns regarding Seedance 2.0," a company spokesperson said in a statement shared with CNBC. 

"We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorized use of intellectual property and likeness by users," the spokesperson added. 

ByteDance's response comes after receiving backlash and stern warnings from Hollywood groups like the Motion Picture Association (MPA), a trade association representing major Hollywood studios including Netflix, Paramount Skydance, Sony, Universal, Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney. 

The group issued a forceful public statement at the end of last week demanding that ByteDance immediately cease what it called "infringing activity." 

"In a single day, the Chinese AI service Seedance 2.0 has engaged in unauthorized use of U.S. copyrighted works on a massive scale," said MPA chairman and CEO Charles Rivkin in the statement. 

"By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs."

According to a report from Axios, Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter Friday to ByteDance, accusing the company of distributing and reproducing its intellectual property through the new AI tool without permission. 

The legal notice alleged that ByteDance had effectively pre-packaged Seedance with a pirated library of copyrighted characters, portraying them as if they were public-domain clip art," the report added. 

Disney has also sent cease-and-desist letters to AI companies in the past. In September, the company warned the AI startup Character.AI to stop the unauthorized use of its copyrighted characters.

While trying to protect its intellectual property, Disney has signed a licensing deal with and invested in OpenAI. The agreement allows the AI company to use Disney characters from the Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel franchises in its Sora video generator.

Paramount Skydance has also sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance, making similar accusations, Variety reported over the weekend.

Cryptocurrency payments to suspected human trafficking syndicates surged 85% in 2025, with hundreds of millions of transactions traced on public blockchains, according to a new report by Chainalysis.

The U.S.-based blockchain analytics firm said most of the activity was linked to an expanding criminal ecosystem in Southeast Asia, where scam compounds, illegal online gambling operations and Chinese-language money laundering networks operate in unison. 

Chainalysis said in its report that crypto activity by human traffickers largely fell into three categories: International escort and prostitution services; labor placement agents and scam compounds; and child sexual abuse material (CSAM) vendors. 

While data on the blockchain shows most services were concentrated in Southeast Asia, customers sent payments from across North and South America, Europe and Australia, highlighting the global reach of the operations.

The report also found that cybercriminals are increasingly relying on messaging platforms such as Telegram to advertise their services, recruit victims, and coordinate payments. 

"There's a broader migration from older darknet forums into messaging apps and semi‑open Telegram ecosystems, which, combined with crypto, let these networks scale faster, run 'customer services,' and move money globally with much less friction," Chainalysis intelligence analyst Tom McLouth told CNBC. 

However, Chainalysis adds that the transparency of public blockchains also provides "unprecedented visibility" into criminal financial flows, which watchdogs and authorities rely on to disrupt activities. 

"The key takeaway is that the true financial scale is large, at least hundreds of millions of USD worth of crypto transactions, and the physical harm is orders of magnitude greater than any dollar figure," said McLouth. 

Blockchain activity suggests that highly organized networks were behind many transactions. 

While some escort services and sex work operate legally, the report said potential trafficking operations can be identified through distinct financial behaviors.

In particular, suspected networks are increasingly relying on stablecoins and Chinese‑language money laundering groups to cash out quickly, McLouth said. 

These laundering networks operate primarily through Chinese-language Telegram channels, which can help cybercriminals "clean" illicit funds by moving them through cryptocurrency. Chainalysis estimates that those services funneled at least $16.1 billion in illicit funds in 2025. 

Data showed that crypto-linked international escort services also accounted for a significant share of higher-value transfers tracked by Chainalysis, with nearly half of transactions exceeding $10,000.

Listings reviewed by researchers advertised cross-border travel packages, multi-day "companionship" services and tiered pricing structures, with VIP packages priced above $30,000. 

Chainalysis said the size and consistency of these transfers, along with repeated payment patterns between wallet clusters, suggest professionalized operations rather than isolated individuals.

Crypto payments to suspected prostitution networks showed a distinct cluster of smaller transactions than those of escort services, mostly between $1,000 and $10,000. Still, Chainalysis said this data suggested operations consistent with agency-level activity.

Another major category involved so-called "labor placement agents" who recruit individuals into scam compounds, usually in Southeast Asia, known for carrying out crypto-based schemes. 

Recruitment fees typically range from $1,000 to $10,000 in cryptocurrency, matching the prices advertised on Telegram channels, the report said.

Examples cited in the report include posts seeking "customer service" or "data entry" workers for jobs in Cambodia or Myanmar, promising high monthly salaries and covering travel costs. 

Once recruited, victims were allegedly forced to conduct romance scams, fake cryptocurrency investment schemes and other online frauds targeting victims abroad.

In some Telegram conversations analyzed by Chainalysis, recruiters discussed transporting workers across borders, arranging forged documents and coordinating payments to intermediaries. 

The firm also identified links between recruitment channels and wallets previously associated with illegal gambling platforms and money laundering services, suggesting that the trafficking activity was linked to broader criminal enterprises.

The scale of these compounds was highlighted last year when the U.S. Department of Justice announced the seizure of bitcoin worth about $15 billion at the time from a massive Cambodian scam center that was running romance scams.

"Since late 2025 we've seen more enforcement around parts of this ecosystem, especially scam compounds, but the underlying sexual exploitation and trafficking networks can often keep operating via alternative infrastructure, both physical and digital," said McLouth.

Chainalysis also tracked networks involved in child sexual abuse material (CSAM), which operated under different crypto payment structures but also reflected growing levels of organization and "sophisticated financial and distribution strategies."

While about half of CSAM-related crypto transactions were below $100, that price point reflected individual payments within subscription-based models in private chat groups and encrypted file-sharing channels, the report said.

The blockchain tracker also observed these funds moving from mainstream cryptocurrencies into privacy-focused assets such as Monero, as well as instant exchange services that require no identity verification.

The report also documented overlaps between CSAM subscription services and "sadistic online extremism" communities.

"These [sadistic online extremism] groups specifically target and manipulate minors through sophisticated sextortion schemes, with the resulting content being monetized through cryptocurrency payments, perpetuating cycles of abuse," the report said.

In July 2025, Chainalysis said it helped identify one of the largest CSAM websites operating on the dark web following a UK law enforcement lead. 

That single operation utilized over 5,800 cryptocurrency addresses and generated more than $530,000 in revenue since July 2022. 

"In general, as crypto adoption grows, its use for both illicit and legitimate purposes will increase," said McLouth. "In the near term, I don't expect crypto use in trafficking‑linked activity to go away, if anything, I expect it to keep growing even as enforcement gets better."

TikTok's U.S. joint venture seems to have survived a turbulent rollout with minimal change in usership, as early narratives of a mass user exodus prompted by service outages and censorship concerns now appear overstated, according to new figures.

Survey data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower show that, despite a surge in deletions following the announcement of TikTok's U.S. joint venture on Jan. 23, the average number of TikTok's daily active users in the U.S. remains around 95% of its usership compared to the week of Jan. 19-25.

The joint venture — officially the TikTok USDS Joint Venture  — was established in compliance with U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order mandating the divestiture of TikTok in the U.S. from its Chinese parent company ByteDance.

While ByteDance retains a 19.9% stake in TikTok's U.S. operations after the agreement, Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX each own a 15% share, with the remaining shares divvied among several other firms.

Following the announcement, users were quick to express discontent over TikTok's new ownership.

The deal drew scrutiny, with prominent figures like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) raising concerns about cronyism over Oracle co-founder and Chief Technical Officer Larry Ellison's involvement.

Following the joint venture's announcement that Ellison's Oracle would "retrain, test, and update the content recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data", online speculation mounted that TikTok would begin mining user data or promoting content supportive of Trump's policy positions.

Such concerns spiked on Jan. 25, with users claiming that TikTok was suppressing content critical of controversial Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, and censoring buzzwords like 'Epstein' on the platform.

Last month, CNBC confirmed that messages containing the word "Epstein" triggered an error message, but was unable to independently verify broader claims of political censorship.

Asked about the issues, a spokesperson for the TikTok joint venture told CNBC in January that the platform does not prohibit sharing the name 'Epstein' in messages and that it was investigating why some users are experiencing the problem, among others.

CNBC reached out to the White House and TikTok for comment but did not receive a response by publication.

Although TikTok attributed last month's disruptions to power outages, the glitches "no doubt impact[ed] how and what content was being served, even without any intent or motive," according to Jim Johnston, partner at law firm Davis+Gilbert LLP.

Yet despite various user pledges to boycott the platform over apparent political suppression, engagement metrics among U.S. users suggest there has been little sign of a mass exodus.

The average daily time spent by American users on the platform has since returned to around 80 minutes, after dipping to an average of 77 minutes during the week of the reported disruptions, according to Sensor Tower data.

Additionally, while deletions spiked after the reported disruptions, they tapered off the following week, suggesting a temporary surge rather than a sustained boycott of the app.

"It is plausible that the short-lived rise in observed uninstalls was due to an attempt to troubleshoot the app," Abraham Yousef, senior insights analyst at Sensor Tower, told CNBC, as the number of uninstalls followed by re-installations on the same day surged more than 70% on Jan. 25 from the day before.

While Yousef grants that the data suggests a "slight impact to overall usage" in the weeks after the Joint Venture was announced, there is no clear indication of a structural shift in user trends, as many sites touted as alternatives to TikTok have also struggled to sustain interest.

According to Sensor Tower, the number of new installs for UpScrolled - a social media platform that offers an algorithm free of automated systems that filter out content from some users known as shadow banning - surged by about 770% from the previous week, with more than 955,000 new U.S. downloads over the week of Jan. 26 to Feb. 1.

New UpScrolled downloads, however, fell sharply by about 80% the following week, bringing in only around 191,000 new users. In comparison, TikTok registered 870,000 downloads over the week of Jan. 26 to Feb. 1, and around 800,000 the following week.

Similarly, new downloads of other alternative platforms such as Skylight Social and Red Note respectively declined by 96% and 33% week-on-week from the week of Jan. 26.

Sensor Tower's user data more fundamentally seems to suggest that beyond anecdotal claims, users have largely been unable to identify tangible changes in TikTok's American operations, or at least, not enough to meaningfully shift user sentiment.

"The idea of a mass exodus from TikTok now looks overblown," Kelsey Chickering, principal analyst from Forrester, told CNBC. "Anecdotally, most users say the app feels largely the same - the algorithm hasn't meaningfully changed, and the experience is still strong," 

While some American users may have perceived changes in the operation of their TikTok algorithms, "some changes to content suggestions are bound to occur simply due to the changed data set," according to Johnston, referring to the Joint Venture's announcement to retrain the algorithm on U.S. data.

But while analysts have been unable to find evidence that TikTok's new American owners have engineered the platform in their favor, this is not a foregone conclusion.

According to Johnston, there are at least three notable changes to TikTok's new terms of use, including the platform's ability to collect precise location data from enabled devices, its collection of data on interactions with artificial intelligence tools on the app and its explicit integration with ad networks.

Although there has been no hard evidence of its occurrence, it remains technically possible to adjust TikTok's algorithm to enhance or diminish the impact of certain types of content on recommendations, Johnston said.

Chickering adds that under its new owners, TikTok has more control over what shows up on American feeds, but this control, according to Chickering, is where TikTok's opportunity - and risk - lies. 

"If moderation starts to feel politically slanted or misinformation isn't adequately addressed, the platform could face backlash from users and advertisers alike," Chickering said, "We've seen this play out before: Twitter's shift to X is a recent reminder of how quickly trust can erode."

For now, however, the discontent from TikTok's American users that marred its first few weeks under new ownership seems to have largely subsided.

As Chickering notes, "we've seen time and time again, if the product works, users tend to stick around regardless of who owns it."

Anthropic famously employs a Scottish philosopher named Amanda Askell.

Her job is to imbue its chatbot, Claude, with a personality and a set of moral guardrails. She is essentially teaching it to be cool and good.

Elon Musk, however, doesn't think she's qualified.

"Those without children lack a stake in the future," Musk posted on X in response to a profile of Askell published by The Wall Street Journal.

The Journal profile does not say whether Askell has kids. Musk, who has imbued his own chatbot, Grok, with a distinct personality, has 14 of them. Musk is known for promoting a brand of pronatalism that's become popular among Silicon Valley elites.

Askell responded with her trademark dry intellectualism.

"I think it depends on how much you care about people in general vs. your own kin," Askell wrote. "I do intend to have kids, but I still feel like I have a strong personal stake in the future because I care a lot about people thriving, even if they're not related to me."

"I think caring about your children can make you feel invested in the future in a new and very profound way, and I do understand people wanting to convey that," she added.

The responses to their short back-and-forth were as varied as you might expect on Musk's social media network. A day later, Askell posted again.

"I'm too right wing for the left and I'm too left wing for the right," she said. "I'm too into humanities for those in tech and I'm too into tech for those in the humanities. What I'm learning is that failing to polarize is itself quite polarizing."

The U.S. consumer price index on Friday stateside provided some balm to investors, who have been singed by drops in the market because of artificial intelligence-related fears. Consumer inflation for January rose 2.4% on a year-on-year basis, lower than the 2.7% in December, and returning to where it was after President Donald Trump fired off tariffs globally in April 2025. Core CPI came in at 2.5%, the lowest since April 2021. Economists were expecting 2.5% for both figures.

"This should be welcome news for markets, and the presumptive incoming Fed Chair Kevin Warsh," said Phil Blancato, Osaic chief market strategist. "This is only one month's worth of data, but if the trend continues it should pave a path for lower interest rates and reined in inflation."

U.S. markets, however, on Friday made only tentative steps in either direction, perhaps still unsure of where to move amid uncertainty about the effects of AI on companies. All major indexes ended the week in the red.

Another source of comfort for investors — and everyone else, really — are signs of cooling tensions between the U.S. and Iran. Both countries will be having their second round of talks on Tuesday in Geneva, Tehran's Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC, adding that the Iran is ready to discuss restricting its nuclear program for lighter sanctions and economic benefits for both sides.

Meanwhile, Japan's economy expanded 0.1% in the last three months of 2025 on a quarter-on-quarter basis, reversing a 0.6% contraction in the third quarter. However, gross domestic product growth still missed the 0.4% expansion expected by a Reuters poll of economists. 

— CNBC's Sean Conlon, Pia Singh, Lim Hui Jie and Jeff Cox contributed to this report.

Data center might have to 'internalize' costs, said Peter Navarro, the Trump administration's trade and manufacturing adviser. Navarro did not detail what the White House's plan to force data center builders to absorb costs would look like.  

Epstein files fallout: The recent release by the U.S. Department of Justice of emails and other documents related to sex predator Jeffrey Epstein has led to a wave of resignations of high-profile people around the world whose dealings with him have been exposed.

Warner Bros. may reopen sale talks with Paramount, reported Bloomberg News on Sunday, citing unnamed sources. Last week, Paramount improved its offer, saying it would add a ticking fee of 25 cents a share for any delay in regulatory approval of the deal.

The S&P 500 was mostly flat, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.22% on Friday. The pan-European Stoxx 600 dropped 0.13%, with L'Oreal and Delivery Hero falling roughly 4%.

Markets brace for more AI noise and 'scare trading'

AI disruption jitters have ripped through global stock markets over the last couple of weeks, with sectors across the spectrum ending up in the crosshairs of investors looking to bet on which industry could be upended by the inevitable wave of agentic AI.

There will almost certainly be more of these moments this week, as some of the biggest names in AI take to the stage at the AI Impact Summit in India. Headliners include Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Microsoft's Brad Smith, Mistral AI co-Founder Arthur Mensch and Meta's Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang.

Shares of Australia's Qube Holdings jumped to a record high Monday after the ports and logistics company agreed to be taken over by a consortium led by Macquarie Asset Management at an enterprise value of about $11.7 billion Australian dollars ($8.26 billion).

Qube Holdings jumped 3.6% to over $5 Australian dollars.

The offer represents a 27.8% premium to Qube's last closing price of AU$4.07 on Nov. 21, the final trading day before the company announced it had entered an exclusivity process for the deal, Qube said in a statement.

The deal is structured as an all-cash offer of A$5.20 per share for public shareholders, other than UniSuper which holds about 15% of Qube and will roll its stake into a new holding structure.

The consortium is led by Macquarie Asset Management and includes UniSuper and Pontegadea, the investment firm of Spanish billionaire and Zara founder Amancio Ortega.

"The scheme consideration represents a significant premium to the share price prior to the announcement. It reflects the strength of the business today and the strong growth prospects Qube enjoys," said Qube Chairman John Bevan.

Qube is a major Australian logistics and infrastructure group with operations spanning Australia, Southeast Asia and New Zealand. Its network handles a range of freight services, including bulk commodity exports. The company employs around 10,000 people.

The transaction is expected to be put to shareholders around June 2026, and will be subject to regulatory approvals, including from Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission, New Zealand's Overseas Investment Office and Papua New Guinea's competition regulator.

If the deal is delayed beyond Dec. 15, 2026, the consortium would pay an extra 2 Australian cents per share per month until completion.

Macquarie Asset Management currently manages around AU$720 billion in assets globally across public and private markets with portfolio companies spanning across the infrastructure, real estate and green investments sectors.

Summary:

The NFT craze of 2021 led to massive purchases, celebrity endorsements, and skyrocketing valuations, but now the bubble has burst.

Logan Paul and Justin Bieber are among the celebrities who have seen their NFT investments plummet in value by over 95%.

The total NFT market cap has dropped significantly, leading to the closure of major platforms and rendering roughly 95% of NFTs worthless.

Remember when everyone and their cousin was buying NFTs? When a pixelated ape was worth more than a house, and celebrities were flexing digital receipts like they'd cracked some kind of financial cheat code?

Yeah. About that.

YouTuber Logan Paul purchased an NFT from the 0N1 Force collection — a series of anime-style digital avatar artworks — for $635,000 in 2021. That same NFT is now valued at roughly $155, reflecting a loss of more than 99%. The valuation comparison recently circulated via the verified X account of Watcher.Guru and has since spread widely across cryptocurrency communities.

Paul himself acknowledged the L years ago. In a 2022 post on X, he wrote that the NFT he'd spent $623,000 on was “worth essentially nothing,” calling it an immortalized mistake. It's only gotten worse since.

And he's not the only one. Pop star Justin Bieber purchased a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT for $1.3 million in January 2022 that has since dropped to around $12,000 by February 2026 — a decline of over 95%.

The 2021 NFT Boom, In Hindsight

To understand how we got here, you have to remember how unhinged 2021 was. NFT trading hit $17.6 billion that year, a 21,000% surge from 2020's total of $82 million, according to data from Nonfungible.com. More than 2.5 million crypto wallets were holding or trading NFTs, up from just 89,000 the year before. Beeple sold a single digital artwork for $69 million at Christie's. Everybody wanted in.

Celebrity endorsements supercharged the frenzy. Paul alone spent over $2.5 million on 139 NFTs from 16 collections in 2021. The logic was simple: if a famous person bought it, it must be valuable. Scarcity narratives and online hype did the rest.

The hangover has been brutal. The total NFT market cap dropped from $17 billion in early 2022 to roughly $2.8 billion by January 2026 — an 84% decline. Average sale prices have dropped sharply, often falling below $100, with the art segment suffering the steepest declines.

The platforms that built the boom are disappearing. Nifty Gateway, one of the earliest NFT marketplaces that facilitated over $300 million in sales at its peak, shut down on February 23, 2026. Christie's quietly closed its digital art department last fall, and Sotheby's laid off most of its NFT team in 2024. Other shuttered platforms include Kraken NFT, X2Y2, Bybit NFT, LG Art Lab, and MakersPlace. Nike also quietly offloaded its NFT subsidiary RTFKT, which it had acquired during the boom.

Analysis suggests roughly 95% of NFTs are now worthless.

The broader crypto market isn't having a great time either. After reaching an all-time high of approximately $126,198 in October 2025, Bitcoin has faced a sharp retracement. As of February 16, 2026, Bitcoin is trading around $68,605 — down more than 45% from that peak. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has been hovering near “extreme fear” levels not seen since the 2022 FTX collapse. U.S. exchange-traded funds, which purchased 46,000 bitcoin at this point last year, have become net sellers in 2026.

Some analysts are calling it a standard four-year cycle correction. Others are less optimistic.

                Robinhood's new main net aims to revolutionize trading with instant settlements and tokenized assets.            

Share

Johann Kerbrat is Senior Vice President and General Manager of Robinhood Crypto. Prior to Robinhood, he served as VP of Engineering at Iron Fish, a privacy-focused Layer 1 blockchain project. Under his leadership, Robinhood Crypto acquired Bitstamp and launched tokenized US stocks and ETFs in Europe.

Blockchain technology can fundamentally improve traditional financial systems.

 — Johann Kerbrat

It's still not working twenty four seven it's still not instant to buy a stock and to settle and all of this already exist in crypto for a long time.

 — Johann Kerbrat

Crypto and blockchain is not just trading off asset it's also technology that can be used to replace financial systems.

Something went wrong

Bitcoin and crypto markets have entered a new phase defined less by speculation and more by portfolio discipline, according to a new note from WisdomTree.

Dovile Silenskyte, director of digital assets research at WisdomTree, wrote in a note shared with Decrypt that the days of survival and price discovery are behind crypto traders.

"Crypto has moved on from its retail-led, boom-bust adolescence. Infrastructure largely works, regulation is tightening rather than retreating and capital is behaving more like institutional capital," she wrote. "This changes the rules of engagement. The key shift is subtle, but decisive, as the debate has moved from 'Should we own crypto?' to 'How do we implement it responsibly?'"

Silenskyte added that crypto investors need to understand that the nature of the market has changed, particularly because traditional diversification is under strain as inflation risk lingers, fiscal dominance is persistent, and equity-bond correlations have become unreliable.

The New York-based asset manager, founded in 2006, is best known for its exchange-traded products. That catalog of funds now includes institutional-grade exposure to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and broader crypto baskets.

The firm issues the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW), WisdomTree Ethereum Fund (ETHW), and WisdomTree Crypto Industry Innovators Fund (WCBR)—all U.S. based. In Europe, the firm has a broader offering that includes funds tied to Solana, Cardano, Polkadot, and XRP.

One of the benefits of Bitcoin consolidating into institutional hands is that it's led to compressed volatility, Silenskyte wrote. That's been helped along, in part, by regulation.

"Regulation is acting as a filter, not a kill switch, concentrating capital into assets and structures that meet governance, custody and transparency standards," she wrote.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin has been trading for $67,463.03 after having dropped 2.2% in the past 24 hours. The coin is now 1.6% lower than it was this time last week, according to crypto price aggregator CoinGecko.

Harvard Management Company has reduced its stake in the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF by roughly a fifth in the fourth quarter and started a new position with a spot Ethereum ETF.

According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the previous quarter, the endowment manager reported lower holdings of the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust and disclosed a first-time position in the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF.

It held 5,353,612 shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust as of December 31, down from 6,813,612 shares in Q3, and reported a market value of about $265.8 million for that position at year-end.

Notably, the same filing lists 3,873,044 new shares of the iShares Ethereum Trust, valued at roughly $86.8 million, bringing the combined spot crypto ETF exposure to just over $352 million at quarter-end.

Harvard first disclosed a $116 million position in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust in August last year. By November, it had tripled those holdings to roughly $350 million in market value at the time.

Harvard's latest adjustments to its crypto ETF holdings come amid choppy conditions from late 2025, when spot Bitcoin ETFs saw bouts of net outflows continuing through January and February this year.

Industry observers are divided over whether the reallocation reflects relative value positioning, diversification, or institutional constraints shaping Harvard's digital asset strategy.

Harvard is likely “making a relative value trade with the belief that ETH is undervalued relative to BTC,” Sean Bill, co-founder and chief investment officer at Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company, told Decrypt, adding that the endowment may have “a limit on the initial exposure that it can maintain in digital assets” and could have reduced its Bitcoin stake “to make room for a short-term trade in ETH.”

Still, he said the 13F is “a good tool to track the general sentiment of the filing entity,” noting that HMC "initiated a long position in BTC in Q2 2025, grew that position and held it through the downturn,” which in his view signals sustained long-term conviction in Bitcoin's place in institutional portfolios.

“Harvard's decision to trim its Bitcoin ETF exposure while initiating a position in an Ethereum ETF likely reflects a more differentiated view of opportunity across digital assets,” Jennifer Ouarrag, Head of Legal at institutional staking provider Twinstake, told Decrypt.

While Bitcoin remains “the primary institutional store-of-value proxy,” Ethereum “offers exposure to a broader smart-contract ecosystem.” Such a differentiation could signal that “a recalibration toward assets with multiple return drivers,” is in line, she added.

The move “mirrors recent institutional behavior, where allocators have rotated capital between Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs and shown increased interest in staking-enabled products that offer both price exposure and network participation income,” she said.

“One functions as immutable money. The other is programmable infrastructure,” Nima Beni, founder of Bitlease, told Decrypt. “Both belong in institutional portfolios, but treating them as substitutes risks misunderstanding their structural differences.”

Harvard's trade “likely reflects regulatory clarity and ETF accessibility, optimizing for near-term compliance comfort rather than long-term structural positioning,” Beni added.

Some have described the move as a “textbook allocator move,” with Iva Wisher, founder of Bitcoin-native execution environment Midl, arguing that it reflects a move away from “single-asset crypto exposure” rather than a loss of faith in Bitcoin.

Someone at Harvard's committee “might've just said 'the thesis works, now let's build a real portfolio around it',” he said. “When a $50 billion endowment starts treating digital assets as an asset class rather than a single bet, that's a maturity signal.”

The trim “doesn't mean they prefer one over the other, they're a long-term investor and it's more of a nuanced view of risk and opportunity,” Abdul Rafay Gadit, co-founder of Zigchain, told Decrypt. “The more meaningful signal isn't the precise ETF weighting in a single quarter, but whether institutions are incrementally expanding their comfort with on-chain infrastructure over time.”

Barry Silbert, CEO of cryptocurrency conglomerate Digital Currency Group, said Wednesday that privacy-focused cryptocurrencies are poised to become the next big investment opportunity in the industry.

During a conversation with Anthony Pompliano at the Bitcoin Investor Week conference, Silbert said his thesis is that 5-10% of Bitcoin's (CRYPTO: BTC) market cap would rotate into privacy coins, including Zcash (CRYPTO: ZEC).

Silbert acknowledged that Bitcoin also started as an “anonymous” currency, but then it “lost the plot” due to the rise of on-chain analytics firms.

“Bitcoin, for all its amazing attributes, is likely never going to have any privacy features,” he argued.

That doesn't mean Silbert is bearish on Bitcoin's long-term potential.

“I am incredibly bullish about Bitcoin as a core part of a diversified portfolio,” he stated. “But I like to invest in projects that I think are transformative.”

Silbert argued that Bitcoin will not soar 500 times unless the dollar crashes, but coins such as ZEC have that kind of upside potential.

Privacy-focused cryptocurrencies outperformed market heavyweights, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), last year. ZEC and Monero (CRYPTO: XMR) surged 853% and 123%, respectively.

That said, these coins have failed to shield themselves from this year's early crypto slump.

Unlike Bitcoin, ZEC transactions by default do not reveal the sending and receiving addresses or the amount being sent. However, there is an option to disclose this data for auditing or regulatory compliance.

Silbert's views come in the wake of the recent cryptocurrency crash, which he described as a “gift from the crypto gods.” He suggested that the slump is clearing out excess leverage and “crap tokens”, potentially paving the way for significant capital inflows back into the sector.

Bloomberg Intelligence macro strategist Mike McGlone said Monday that collapsing crypto prices may signal broader financial stress, warning bitcoin could revert toward $10,000 and potentially foreshadow the next U.S. recession.

In a post on X, McGlone also said the long-standing “buy the dip” mentality that has supported risk assets since 2008 could be breaking down as digital assets weaken and volatility dynamics shift.

After climbing back to $70,841 by 07:00 UTC on Feb. 15 from $65,395 late on Feb. 12, bitcoin was hovering around $68,800 by mid-morning. The broader crypto market was also in the red Monday, with 85 of the top 100 tokens posting losses. Privacy-focused coins monero and zcash were down 10% and 8%, respectively over the past 24 hours.

“Healthy Correction is what we should hear soon from stock market analysts (who risk unemployment if not onboard), following collapsing cryptos,” McGlone wrote. “The buy the dips mantra since 2008 may be over.”

McGlone pointed to several macro indicators that reflect elevated risk conditions. U.S. stock market capitalization relative to gross domestic product (GDP) has reached its highest level in roughly a century, he noted. At the same time, 180-day volatility in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 is at its lowest level in about eight years, McGlone added.

He also described the “crypto bubble” as “imploding,” adding that “Trump euphoria” has peaked and is contributing to contagion across markets. Meanwhile, gold and silver are “grabbing alpha” at a pace last seen about half a century ago, with rising volatility that he said could “trickle up” into equities.

McGlone shared a chart comparing bitcoin divided by 10 for scaling, with the S&P 500. As of Feb. 13, both were hovering below 7,000 on his graphic. He said that “volatile and beta-dependent” bitcoin is unlikely to stay above that level if broader equity beta weakens.

The Bloomberg analyst identified 5,600 on the S&P 500, equivalent to roughly $56,000 for bitcoin under his scaling, as an initial “normal reversion” level. Beyond that, part of his base case calls for bitcoin to revert toward $10,000, contingent on a peak in the U.S. stock market.

Jason Fernandes, co-founder of AdLunam and a market analyst, told CoinDesk that McGlone's thesis assumes market extremes must resolve through collapse and that bitcoin's equity beta guarantees a proportional crash.

“That's false equivalence and single-path bias,” Fernandes said. “Markets can also resolve excess through time, rotation, or inflation erosion. A macro slowdown could mean consolidation or a $40,000 to $50,000 reset, not a systemic unwind to $10,000.”

Fernandes added that a move toward $10,000 would likely require a true systemic event, including sharp liquidity contraction, widening credit spreads, forced deleveraging across funds and a disorderly equity drawdown.

“That implies recession plus financial stress, not just slower growth,” he said. “Absent a credit shock or policy mistake that drains global liquidity, that kind of collapse remains a low-probability tail risk.”

Former teen pop icon Justin Bieber has taken a massive hit in one of his NFTs over the last few years. In 2022, he purchased one of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) digital collectibles for 500 ETH (worth $1.2 million) in a much-publicized transaction. However, his NFT is now worth just a fraction of what he paid for it, down 99.99%.

The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) is among the two most recognizable NFT collections, alongside Cryptopunks. The iterations of the same bored chimp in thousands of different avatars was a novel idea that helped propel the NFT market to new heights during 2020-2022, the last major crypto boom.

In 2021, the NFT market attracted more than $40 billion in total capital sent to marketplaces. Trading volumes were estimated at between $17.6 billion and $25.1 billion for the calendar year.

However, NFTs have since faded into the background, and tens of billions of dollars spent on them have been wiped out by market forces. The total market capitalization of NFTs is just around $1.55 billion as of early 2026, with only a few blue-chip collections retaining some value, if at all.

The BAYC collection had 10,000 NFTs and was a major internet and social media sensation back in the day. The value of NFTs varied significantly based on appearance, style, color schemes, and even prior ownership. Bieber paid a premium for the BAYC 3001 back in the day, and at the time, some analysts thought it was a bargain. Here is the collectible:

Bieber didn't give an official reason behind the purchase, but it was reported that this particular piece had physical similarities to the pop icon. 

The only silver lining for Bieber in this situation is that his ownership of #3001 might make the collectible more valuable than its reported $12,000 price tag, given his association with it. 

Other popular digital collectibles like Pudgy Penguins and Cryptopunks have also incurred heavy losses since 2022, and the overall sector is stuck in a permanent decline for now, unlike Bitcoin, which has seen ups and downs over the last two years. 

Prediction markets are not in favor of an NFT comeback, but BAYC's creators aren't fazed by the overall downturn. 

Last October, Yuga Labs announced plans to open a physical Bored Ape clubhouse in Miami, Florida, an exclusive hangout for its NFT holders. The whole promise of these digital collections was exclusivity, and that's the model they want to continue with right now.

The crypto market remains under pressure on Monday despite U.S. equity futures rising by around 0.25% since midnight UTC.

Bitcoin BTC$68,770.50 trades at $68,710, having lost 0.1%. Altcoins such as HYPE, ZEC and XMR are down by more than 3%.

Ether ETH$1,978.09 is one of Monday's outliers, rising by 0.43% since midnight as it claws its way back to $2,000 after a grueling weekend selloff was spurred by selling pressure from trader Garrett Jin.

Onchain data shows a wallet attributed to Jin deposited more than $540 million worth of ether to Binance over the weekend, leading to a disproportionate rise in sell volume compared with other exchanges.

That pressure translated into oversold conditions that ultimately set the scene for Monday's recovery.

Gold is changing hands at $5,000 on Monday, down from its Jan. 29 peak of $5,600 but outperforming silver and crypto, which are down by 36% and 21% respectively over the same period.

U.S. markets are closed on Monday due to a public holiday.

If we cast our minds back to 2022, you'd be familiar with the word 'NFT' being thrown around online and popularised by some of the world's biggest stars. 

For the blissfully unaware, a non-fungible token (NFT) is essentially a 'token' to say you own a digital item. Each NFT has a different level of value and popularity.

Ownership is tracked through the blockchain, a system that records information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. Each NFT has a different level of value and popularity.

NFTs became some sort of dystopian status symbol following the pandemic – especially Bored Ape ones, which were purchased by the likes of Paris Hilton, Eminem, Jimmy Fallon, and Serena Williams. 

Justin Bieber forked out a staggering $1.3 million for a Bored Ape in January 2022. Today, it's reportedly worth an estimated $12,000, meaning it's dropped 99 per cent in value. 

Moreover, Logan Paul purchased a rare Bumblebee 0N1 Force NFT for $623,000 in 2021. Five years later, it's said to be valued at $155.

"I'm just shocked it is worth $155, and not more like $1.55, if that," one person quipped. 

It's worth noting that the value of NFTs fluctuates. 

It didn't take long for netizens to chime in on the action, with many highlighting how their "NFTs are pointless" theories have come to fruition. 

One wrote: "If I had a dollar for every time I said ‘NFTs are worthless' and heard back ‘U JUST DONT UNDERSTAND' I would have more dollars than this NFT is worth."

Another reiterated: "NFTs are worthless, it's pictures backed by nothing."

A third penned: "My wallet is full of NFTs, and they've mostly gone to zero! Is there any way I can get my money back?"

Meanwhile, another shared: "The NFT craze was wild. Looking back, it feels like one of the biggest money grabs of the decade — and people really bought in."

Bill Gates tried to warn people earlier on. In 2022, he described the NFT craze as being "100 per cent based on greater fool theory," the idea that someone can make money by purchasing overvalued assets. The buyer simply waits for the "bigger idiot" – or "greater fool" if you like – to come along and buy them out.

Bitcoin BTC$68,770.50 treasury firm Strategy (MSTR) said it can ride out a potential plunge in the price of the largest cryptocurrency to $8,000 and still honor its debt.

"Strategy can withstand a drawdown in $BTC price to $8K and still have sufficient assets to fully cover our debt," the Michael Saylor-led company said on X.

The company, which holds more bitcoin than any other publicly traded company, has accumulated 714,644 BTC, worth roughly $49.3 billion at current prices, since adopting it as a treasury asset in 2020. 

Over the years, it has stacked bitcoin via debt, a tactic echoed by peers such as Tokyo-listed Metaplanet (3350). It owes about $6 billion — equivalent to 86,956 BTC — against bitcoin holdings over eight times larger.

While these debt-financed bitcoin buys were widely cheered during the crypto bull run, they have become a liability in the wake of the token's crash to nearly $60,000 from its October peak of over $126,000. 

If Strategy is forced to liquidate its bitcoin holdings to pay off the debt, it could flood the market and drive prices even lower.

In the Sunday post, Strategy assured investors its bitcoin holdings would still be worth $6 billion even at an $8,000 BTC price, enough to cover its debt.

The company noted that it doesn't have to pay all its debt at once, as the due dates are spread over 2027 and 2032.

To further assuage concerns, Strategy said it plans to switch existing convertible debt into equity to avoid issuing additional senior debt. Convertible debt is a loan that lenders can swap for MSTR shares if the stock price rises high enough. 

Skeptics remain.

Critics like pseudonymous macro asset manager Capitalists Exploits point out that while $8,000 bitcoin might technically cover the $6 billion net debt, Strategy reportedly paid around $54 billion for its stash, an average of $76,000 per BTC. A slide to $8,000 would amount to a whopping $48 billion paper loss, making the balance sheet look ugly to lenders and investors.

Cash on hand would cover only about 2.5 years of debt and dividend payments at current rates, the observer argued, and the software business pulls in just $500 million a year. That's way too little to handle the $8.2 billion in convertible bonds plus $8 billion in preferred shares, which demand hefty, ongoing dividends like endless interest bills.

All this means that refinancing may not be readily available if bitcoin drops to $8,000.

"Traditional lenders are unlikely to refinance a company whose primary asset has depreciated significantly, with conversion options rendered economically worthless, deteriorating credit metrics, and a stated policy of holding BTC long-term (limiting collateral liquidity)," the observer said in a post on X. "New debt issuance would likely require yields of 15-20% or higher to attract investors, or could fail entirely in stressed market conditions." 

Anton Golub, chief business officer at crypto exchange Freedx, called the "equitizing" move a planned "dump on retail investors."

He explained that buyers of Strategy's convertible bonds have been primarily Wall Street hedge funds, who aren't bitcoin fans but "volatility arbitrageurs."

The arbitrage involves hedge funds profiting from discrepancies between the expected or implied volatility of a convertible bond's embedded options and the actual volatility of the underlying stock. 

Funds typically buy cheap convertible bonds and bet against, or "short," the stock. This setup helps them bypass big price swings, while earning from bond interest, ups-and-downs volatility, and a "pull-to-par" boost where deep-discount bonds rise toward full value at maturity.

According to Golub, Strategy's convertible bonds were priced for small ups and downs. But the stock swung wildly, letting hedge funds mint money from the arbitrage: buying the bonds cheaply while betting against the stock.

This setup worked beautifully when shares traded above $400, the trigger for bondholders to convert debt into stock. Hedge funds closed their shorts, bonds vanished via conversion, and Strategy avoided cash payouts.

At $130 a share, conversion makes no sense. So hedge funds will likely demand full cash repayment when the bonds mature, potentially putting Strategy's finances under strain. 

Golub expects the firm to respond by diluting shares. 

"Strategy will: dilute shareholders by issuing new shares, dump on retail via ATM sales, to raise cash to pay hedge funds," he said in an explainer post on LinkedIn.

"Strategy only looks genius during Bitcoin bull markets. In bear markets, dilution is real and destroys MSTR shareholders," he added.

                        Despite falling crypto prices, more merchants are accepting digital assets, with stablecoins and not volatile tokens driving real payment activity.                      


                        Stablecoins are working through cards, not replacing them, being embedded into network infrastructure as a funding layer.                       


                        Control of the money layer is the real battle, with networks, stablecoin issuers and FinTechs each competing to own the infrastructure connecting tokenized dollars to everyday payments.                      

Crypto markets are slumping just as institutional interest in blockchain is growing.

But as Presidents Day promotions roll out across the U.S., crypto holders who still have some liquidity left in their digital wallets to spend may paradoxically find more retailers than ever ready to accept their tokens.

After all, maybe a 40% dip in bitcoin's price isn't such a big deal when paying for a grill that's 60% off.

Except, in most cases today, it isn't typical crypto tokens like bitcoin or Dogecoin that consumers are shopping with. Stablecoins are what are increasingly being positioned as the best-fit crypto payment mechanism. Rather than replacing cards, stablecoins are being absorbed into card infrastructure as a new settlement and funding source, allowing merchants to accept digital assets without ever holding them, as card networks and their partners do the heavy lifting in the background.

Monthly payment flows via such cards now exceed $1.5 billion, underscoring meaningful consumer usage, and overall crypto-linked card spending has reached roughly $18 billion annualized, signaling a potential migration from more speculative use cases to pure-play retail payments.

And while those numbers represent a modest amount when compared to global card spend, the mechanics of the emerging crypto-linked card marketplace show that incumbent networks are going on offense, not playing defense.

The range of goods and services purchasable with cryptocurrency has expanded far beyond the early days of novelty transactions. Today, consumers can use digital assets to book travel, purchase consumer electronics, pay for cloud services, acquire luxury goods, and even settle recurring bills through intermediaries that convert crypto into local currency at the point of sale.

The most consequential shift, however, may not involve consumers consciously choosing to “pay with crypto” at all, but may come from stablecoin cards that allow users to hold value outside banks while spending within the card ecosystem.

The competition around these products is less about retail payments themselves and more about which institutions will control the monetary layer beneath them, as they, in effect, represent a structural decoupling of deposit capture from payment activity.

The competitive landscape here can be understood as a three-sided race:

Because stablecoins track sovereign currencies, primarily the U.S. dollar, they can function as transactional balances rather than speculative holdings. That stability allows card issuers, FinTech platforms and exchanges to treat them as stored value accounts that fund conventional card transactions.

To the consumer and the merchant, the experience is indistinguishable from using a traditional debit card. Behind the scenes, however, the source of funds may sit in tokenized reserves rather than bank deposits.

Merchants evaluating crypto acceptance today may also be making a decision less about ideology than about optionality.

The earliest large-scale use cases for stablecoin-linked cards are appearing in regions where cross-border payments, currency volatility or limited banking access create friction. In such environments, holding dollar-denominated digital value while spending locally offers tangible advantages. Faster settlement and reduced foreign exchange complexity can outweigh concerns about novelty.

Developed markets, by contrast, already enjoy efficient card systems, making card adoption dependent on other value-added capabilities.

Crucially, for the networks, stablecoins represent more of a new funding source rather than a potential competing acceptance layer. If tokenized dollars can be converted seamlessly at authorization, the network still earns fees, maintains routing authority and preserves its role as the intermediary trusted by both issuers and merchants. The infrastructure remains the same; only the asset entering it changes.

At the end of the day, stablecoin-linked cards may prove to be less of a disruption than a translation mechanism between two monetary systems. Whether they ultimately reshape banking, payments, or digital commerce will depend not on consumer behavior, which has barely changed, but on which institutions succeed in controlling the infrastructure that now connects them.

Crypto markets are deep red on Monday, with industry leader bitcoin sliding lower before a packed week of economic data.

At press time, bitcoin BTC$68,770.50 traded near $68,200, down nearly 3% over 24 hours, with XRP XRP$1.4775, ether ETH$1,978.09, DOGE$0.1026 registering much bigger losses. Losses hit 85 of the top 100 tokens by market cap, with privacy coins like monero XMR$321.94 and zcash ZEC$286.77 down 10% and 8%, respectively. 

Smart contract tokens bled too, with the CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Select Capped Index down nearly 6%, pushing its year-to-date drop to 28%.

The market weakness looks particularly disappointing against the backdrop of the weak U.S. consumer price index data released last week that kept hopes of Fed rate cuts alive.

The CPI growth slowed to 2.4% year-on-year in January from 2.7% in December, the official data showed, reinforcing expectations for at least two 25 basis point rate cuts by the Fed this year. This resulted in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield falling to 4.05%, the lowest since early December. Bitcoin rallied, rising from nearly $66,800 on friday to over $70,000 over the weekend, but failed to establish a foothold there.

Vikram Subburaj, CEO of the India-based regulated Giottus exchange, said selective demand is the reason why rallies struggle to hold.

Rallies have struggled to hold and dips are being bought only selectively near obvious levels," he said in an email to CoinDesk. 

A packed week of macro data lies ahead, with traders eyeing the minutes of the January Fed meeting and the release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index (PCE), for fresh positioning signals. 

"PCE inflation, the Fed's preferred measure, will be closely monitored for confirmation that price pressures are moderating, particularly after CPI showed only gradual disinflation and inflation remains above the 2% target," Dessislava Ianeva, Nexo dispatch analyst, said in an email. 

"Markets will assess both the monthly momentum and year-on-year trend for implications for the policy path." Ianeva added. 

In traditional markets, Mark Nash of Jupiter Asset Management, a high-profile yen bear has flipped bullish, forecasting 8–9% yen appreciation, particularly against the Swiss franc. 

The yen and bitcoin have hit a record positive correlation in recent months, which makes any yen strength a key catalyst for bitcoin bulls.

Crypto markets are deep red on Monday, with industry leader bitcoin sliding lower before a packed week of economic data.

At press time, bitcoin BTC$67,970.18 traded near $68,200, down nearly 3% over 24 hours, with XRP XRP$1.4898, ether ETH$1,979.57, DOGE$0.1026 registering much bigger losses. Losses hit 85 of the top 100 tokens by market cap, with privacy coins like monero XMR$327.76 and zcash ZEC$286.04 down 10% and 8%, respectively. 

Smart contract tokens bled too, with the CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Select Capped Index down nearly 6%, pushing its year-to-date drop to 28%.

The market weakness looks particularly disappointing against the backdrop of the weak U.S. consumer price index data released last week that kept hopes of Fed rate cuts alive.

The CPI growth slowed to 2.4% year-on-year in January from 2.7% in December, the official data showed, reinforcing expectations for at least two 25 basis point rate cuts by the Fed this year. This resulted in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield falling to 4.05%, the lowest since early December. Bitcoin rallied, rising from nearly $66,800 on friday to over $70,000 over the weekend, but failed to establish a foothold there.

Vikram Subburaj, CEO of the India-based regulated Giottus exchange, said selective demand is the reason why rallies struggle to hold. 

"Risk appetite stayed selective and macro cross-currents kept traders defensive. In derivatives, the market continues to behave as if it is ‘de-leveraging first, asking questions later.' Rallies have struggled to hold and dips are being bought only selectively near obvious levels," he said in an email to CoinDesk.

To own Trump Media & Technology Group today, you have to believe the company can turn a small, loss-making media platform into a broader digital ecosystem spanning streaming, fintech, and now crypto-linked products. The pending merger with TAE Technologies, the Truth+ rollout, and “America First” ETFs were already the main near term catalysts, while persistent losses, minimal revenue, governance concerns, and a share price that has fallen about two thirds over the past year remained front and center as risks. The new Truth Social crypto ETF filings with Crypto.com add another potential catalyst, but also another regulatory and execution swing factor, rather than a clear fix for the core problem of limited revenue scale. Given the stock's volatility and recent declines, this latest move may not be a material near term driver without visible uptake or SEC progress.

Oops, something went wrong

Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA) founder Charles Hoskinson says blockchain-powered dating apps like Tinder could unlock 2-3 billion users.

Hoskinson told CoinDesk at Consensus Hong Kong on Wednesday that he wants Tinder running on a blockchain where users can prove properties like height, income, and location while verifying profile pictures are real.

“I want to get to a point where video games are on it, a point where Facebook and other things run on this infrastructure,” Hoskinson said.

“That's what's going to bring 2-3 billion people in and that's what's going to change everything,” he added.

The key is seamless integration. Hoskinson argued consumers shouldn't need to understand blockchain for adoption to occur.

“I don't have to care how electricity works. I just flip the switch and magically it works,” he said. “We have got to do that as an industry and stop ‘overfinancializing' everything.”

The vision targets mainstream apps. Blockchain-powered dating apps could offer enhanced privacy, data ownership, and censorship resistance—features that might attract users disillusioned with centralized platforms.

The same infrastructure could power social media and gaming.

Critical support sits at $0.22-$0.25. The current price tests this zone, with recent lows touching $0.22.

This aligns with both the lower Bollinger Band and SAR level, creating a confluence of potential support.

If $0.22 fails, limited structure exists below. ADA could test $0.20 or lower.

Trading outside the lower Bollinger Band suggests short-term selling overdone, which could trigger a technical bounce toward the middle band around $0.30.

With hundreds of offerings and strong historical exits on select works, Masterworks adds a scarce, globally traded asset to portfolios seeking long-term diversification.

BAM Capital offers accredited investors a way to diversify beyond public markets through institutional-grade multifamily real estate.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide, yet many patients have inadequate responses to current treatments. Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a serotonergic psychedelic with rapid onset and short duration, shows promise as a potential antidepressant (AD), although clinical evidence in MDD remains limited. We conducted a phase IIa, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous DMT (SPL026; DMT fumarate) in adults with moderate-to-severe MDD. Participants received a single 21.5-mg dose of DMT or placebo infused over 10 min, along with supportive psychotherapeutic support, followed by a 2-week assessment. A subsequent open-label phase offered all participants a second DMT dose. The primary outcome was the change in Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at 2 weeks. Secondary outcomes included response (≥50% reduction in MADRS score) and remission (MADRS ≤ 10). A total of 34 participants were randomized, 17 to placebo–active and 17 to active–active. At 2 weeks, the DMT group showed a significantly greater reduction in MADRS score than placebo (mean difference = −7.35; 95% CI = −13.62 to −1.08; P = 0.023). In the open-label phase, AD effects persisted up to 3 months, with no significant differences between those who received one versus two doses. Adverse events were mostly mild to moderate, commonly infusion site pain, nausea and transient anxiety. No serious adverse events occurred. A single dose of DMT with psychotherapeutic support produced a rapid, significant reduction in depressive symptoms, sustained up to 3 months. The treatment was well-tolerated and safe. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04673383.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide, substantially affecting individuals' quality of life and creating a substantial public health burden1,2.

While selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are commonly used as first-line treatments, many patients experience inadequate responses or unacceptable side effects3,4, emphasizing the need for innovative and more effective treatments. Psychedelics have emerged as a promising treatment for mood disorders5,6, with especially psilocybin gaining attention. Meta-analyses of randomized trials indicate that psilocybin produces moderate-to-large antidepressant (AD) effects compared to control (pooled g ≈ 0.66), with benefits emerging by days 8–15 and an optimal dose around 25 mg (refs. 7,8,9,10); these magnitudes exceed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor meta-analytic averages (SMD ≈ g ≈ 0.30)11 and approach ketamine (intravenous (IV), SMD ≈ g ≈ 0.70)12, providing the empirical impetus to test whether similar rapid effects generalize across other classic 5-HT2A agonists, like dimethyltryptamine (N,N-DMT or DMT).

DMT is a naturally occurring tryptamine that acts largely as a serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist13. The serotonin system, and its 5-HT2AR receptors, is implicated in mood regulation, cognition and sensory processing14. Unlike other serotonergic psychedelics, such as oral LSD and psilocybin, IV DMT has a short half life (~5 min) that enables shorter therapeutic sessions, potentially increasing convenience and reducing costs.

Recent studies have provided initial evidence for DMT's AD potential. A placebo-controlled study in healthy psychedelic-experienced participants found that IV DMT (20 mg) administration as a bolus injection with psychological support during dosing day significantly reduced low-level subclinical depression severity and trait anxiety scores after 1 week. These outcomes correlated with peak subjective experiences15. Furthermore, an open-label phase I study investigated IV DMT (0.1 mg kg−1 followed by 0.3 mg kg−1) in MDD participants and healthy controls with minimal psychological support, consisting of a 45-min preparatory session and a debriefing session with the study psychiatrist after the drug effects were weaned off. This exploratory dose-escalation study showed that DMT was safe and well-tolerated, suggesting substantial reductions in depression scores observed in MDD participants the day after dosing. The study also confirmed DMT's rapid onset and short duration of subjective psychedelic effects when given as a bolus injection, making it a practical option for clinical use16. Subsequent studies in healthy volunteers have suggested that administering DMT through a slower IV infusion, as opposed to a rapid bolus, may be better tolerated and associated with fewer anxiety-related or adverse subjective effects10,17,18. This supports the rationale for exploring infusion-based approaches in clinical populations.

In parallel, a recent open-label trial19 evaluated inhaled DMT with psychological support in individuals with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), further supporting the compound's therapeutic potential. Fourteen patients underwent a dose-escalation protocol (15 mg and 60 mg), showing rapid and sustained AD effects, with a mean Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) reduction of 21.14 points by day 7. Response and remission rates reached 85.7% and 57.1%, respectively, and improvements were maintained up to 3 months. The study also confirmed the safety and tolerability of vaporized DMT, suggesting it as a promising, noninvasive alternative to IV administration in clinical settings. In this study, the psychological support element appeared to be more structured, conducted by both a psychotherapist and a psychiatrist, and focused on meaning-making, emotional or cognitive challenges from the acute phase, and promoting insights.

Building on these findings, we conducted a two-stage phase IIa clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a 10-min IV DMT infusion in participants with moderate-to-severe MDD. The trial included a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase followed by an open-label phase (see Fig. 1 for schematics of study design and dosing schedule), with DMT (SPL026; DMT fumarate) administered in a controlled therapeutic environment supported by trained therapists. Please note that this trial is the second part of a two-part trial, the first part being a phase I dose-escalation study in healthy psychedelic-naïve participants, with results reported elsewhere10,20.

Schematic overview of the two-stage phase IIa randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating IV DMT (SPL026) in adults with moderate-to-severe MDD. In stage 1 (double blind), participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive a single 21.5-mg DMT infusion (AA arm; n = 17) or placebo (PA arm; n = 17), each combined with supportive psychotherapy. In stage 2 (open label, 2 weeks later), the PA group received their first DMT dose, and the AA group received a second DMT dose. Assessments were conducted at baseline and at multiple time points up to 3 months (day 105), with an exploratory follow-up at 6 months (day 224).

Across both sites, 399 signed a prescreening consent form and were prescreened. At this stage, 312 were excluded for not meeting criteria, 105 passed prescreening and of these 87 attended a formal screening visit. Of these, 47 participants did not meet inclusion criteria, declined to participate or were excluded for other reasons (Supplementary Results (Consort diagram) and Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus, 34 participants were enrolled and underwent randomization. A total of 17 were assigned to the placebo–active (PA) group and 17 to the active–active (AA) group. Two participants withdrew from the trial. Additionally, four participants in AA group did not receive their second doses but remained in the trial (thus referred to as A−). More details can be found in Fig. 2. For explanation, see Supplementary Results (Participant withdrawals).

The study enrolled 34 participants with a mean age of 32.8 years (±9.1), of whom 29.4% were women, and the majority (88.2%) self-identified as white. Participants had experienced depression for an average of 10.5 years. At baseline, depression severity reflected similar levels of symptom intensity across groups. Eight participants were taking psychiatric medications at the time of screening, which were discontinued for at least 14 days (at least 28 days for monoamine oxidase inhibitors) before their first dosing session. A total of 11 participants reported prior psychedelic use, with all participants except two only experiencing low doses, not reporting any profound or immersive effects from the compounds. First participant was screened on 7 October 2021 and last follow-up occurred on 21 December 2022. Overall, the demographic and clinical characteristics of the groups were comparable, with additional details provided in Table 1.

The mean change from baseline in MADRS scores at 2 weeks after the first dose (the primary outcome) was significantly greater in participants receiving DMT fumarate compared to those receiving placebo and displayed a large effect size (mean difference = −7.35 points; 95% CI = −13.62 to −1.08; P = 0.023; d = 0.82). At 1 week (secondary outcome), the reduction in scores between the two groups was also significant (mean difference = −10.75 points; 95% CI = −16.95 to −4.55; P = 0.002; d = 1.09). In the open-label phase (stage 2), mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) analyses revealed no significant differences in MADRS scores among participants receiving one dose of DMT fumarate (PA group) and those receiving two doses (AA group) at any follow-up time points. At trial week 3 (day 22, 1 week after the second dose), the mean difference between the PA and AA groups was −3.26 points (95% CI = −11.34 to 4.81; P = 0.42). Similar results were observed at week 4 (day 29 = −3.26 points; 95% CI = −11.10 to 4.59; P = 0.41), week 6 (day 45 = 0.16 points; 95% CI = −7.68 to 8.00; P = 0.96) and week 14 (day 105 = 7.03 points; 95% CI = −1.04 to 15.11; P = 0.08; Fig. 3, Supplementary Results (Secondary analysis—MADRS score comparison between PA and AA groups in stage) and Supplementary Table 4).

Mean (±s.e.m.) MADRS total scores from baseline (day −1) to 3-month follow-up (day 105). In stage 1 (double blind), participants who received DMT (AA, n = 17) showed a significantly greater reduction in depressive symptoms at 2 weeks compared with placebo (PA, n = 17; mean difference = −7.35 points; 95% CI = −13.62 to −1.08; P = 0.023, two-sample t test). During stage 2 (open label), both groups maintained improved scores up to 3 months. Error bars indicate s.e. of the mean. Analyses of the double-blinded phase used an independent samples t test, and analyses of the open-label phase used an MMRM.

In participants who received two DMT doses (AA participants in stages 1 and 2), most clinical improvements in MADRS scores were observed within the initial 2 weeks after the first dose, with no significant additional effect observed after the second dose (Supplementary Results (Supplementary analysis—AA group within-participant comparison of two DMT doses) and Supplementary Table 5). Similarly, the timing of the first dose (stage 1 or stage 2) did not significantly influence the reductions in MADRS scores post-DMT (Supplementary Results (Supplementary analysis—timing of the first DMT dose: stage 1 vs stage 2) and Supplementary Table 6).

At 1 week, an MADRS response was observed in 6% PA participants and 44% AA participants (difference = 37.5 percentage points; 95% CI = 10.5 to 64.6), while remission was achieved in 13% and 44%, respectively (difference = 31.3 percentage points; 95% CI = 2.0 to 60.5). At 2 weeks, response rates were 12% for PA and 35% for AA (difference = 23.5 percentage points; 95% CI = −3.9 to 50.9), and remission rates were 12% and 29%, respectively (difference = 17.7 percentage points; 95% CI = −8.9 to 44.2). Sustained response and remission rates during the open-label phase remained stable over time, with no statistically significant differences between groups at any stage 2 time point (remission rates can be found in Supplementary Results (Supplementary analysis—MADRS remission rates) and Supplementary Table 7). Remission and response rates at 6 months for all pooled participants (one or two doses) were 40% and 44%, respectively. All MADRS score data from both groups (PA and AA) and both stages (1 and 2), including 6-month exploratory data, can be found in Table 2. Descriptive representations of Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T) outcome data, which trended in line with the MADRS data, can be found in Supplementary Results (Secondary analysis—all BDI and STAI-T data) and Supplementary Table 3.

The treatment was overall well-tolerated in male and female participants with MDD who received one or two IV doses of DMT fumarate. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in the majority of participants, with 25 individuals (73.5%) reporting 47 TEAEs deemed possibly related to treatment by the investigator. The severity of these TEAEs was largely mild, observed in 15 participants, while 10 participants experienced moderate TEAEs. They mostly resolved over the dosing visit. The incidence of TEAEs was higher after the first dose of DMT fumarate (64.7% in stage 1 and 62.5% in stage 2) compared to placebo (23.5%). Interestingly, a second dose of DMT fumarate in stage 2 in the AA group was associated with a lower incidence of treatment-related TEAEs (23.1%), a proportion similar to that seen in the placebo group (Table 3).

The most frequent treatment-related TEAEs reported after DMT were infusion site pain (3 after placebo and 13 after DMT), nausea (0 after placebo, 6 after DMT), anxiety (0 after placebo, 6 after DMT), headache (0 after placebo, 2 after DMT), insomnia (1 after placebo, 1 after DMT) and restlessness (0 after placebo, 2 after DMT). Notably, there were no serious adverse events related to treatment, no deaths or TEAEs that necessitated withdrawal from the study, dose discontinuation or adjustment. A table listing all TEAEs (including those deemed not related to treatment) can be found in Supplementary Results (Safety results) and Supplementary Table 14.

Clinical evaluations, including physical examinations, laboratory analyses and electrocardiograms (ECGs), revealed no clinically significant abnormalities throughout the trial. However, transient and discrete increases in blood pressure and heart rate were observed immediately after DMT administration (Supplementary Results (Safety results)).

All participants tolerated the dosing sessions well, except for one individual who expressed regret after their second dose (Supplementary Results (Safety results)). Throughout the study, no meaningful or concerning changes in suicidal ideation were recorded based on the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (Supplementary Results (Safety results) and Supplementary Table 18).

AD effects 2 weeks after participants' first active DMT dose were observed to be moderated by their ‘Mystical Experience' Questionnaire (MEQ) scores, as well as Ego Dissolution Inventory, feelings of Unity (11 Dimensions Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire) and subject-led visual analog scales (Individual-Rated Visual Analog Scales) general intensity scores (Supplementary Results (Supplementary materials—acute measures and moderation effects of Mystical Experience (MEQ) scores and related measures of the acute psychedelic experience)). We also explored whether AD washout, prior psychedelic use or psychedelic predictor scale subscales (set, setting, rapport, intention) moderated treatment outcomes. None of these factors showed a significant effect on AD response at 2 weeks. Full results and statistical tables are provided in Supplementary Results (Supplementary analyses on possible effects of antidepressant washout, prior experience with psychedelics and preparation (set, setting, therapeutic rapport and intention) on antidepressant effects). Given the small subgroup sizes and limited power, these findings should be interpreted with caution.

This phase IIa trial evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of one or two 21.5-mg IV 10-min infusions of DMT fumarate with supportive therapy in participants with moderate-to-severe MDD. Participants were randomized to receive either DMT or placebo in a blinded phase, followed 2 weeks later by an open-label phase where all participants could have received active treatment. The primary endpoint, change in MADRS scores from baseline to 2 weeks, demonstrated a significant improvement after DMT treatment compared with placebo, confirming DMT's superior AD efficacy to placebo in the blinded phase of the trial. Thus, the trial's main endpoint was met.

Secondary analyses showed a rapid reduction in MADRS scores by 1 week, and concomitant improvements in response and remission rates generally aligned with the primary outcome. In the open-label phase, the AD effects were durable over 12 weeks (and up to 6 months in some participants), with no notable differences between single-dose and two-dose regimens, suggesting that one dose may suffice for sustained benefits. Nonetheless, at the 3-month follow-up, the PA group exhibited a numerically greater reduction in depressive symptoms compared to the AA group (~7.6 points on the MADRS), a difference similar in magnitude to the significant treatment effect observed at 2 weeks (7.35 points, P = 0.023). However, this longer-term difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.08). This may be due in part to reduced statistical power in part B, where participant dropouts exceeded 10% (9 of 34 participants), limiting the ability to detect between-group differences at later time points. One possible mechanistic explanation for the greater sustained response in the PA group is the longer preparatory phase before dosing. Extended therapist–participant interaction may have facilitated a stronger therapeutic alliance, which is increasingly recognized as a key contributor to outcomes in psychedelic-assisted therapy21. While this remains speculative, the trend observed here highlights the need for future studies that both minimize attrition and directly measure therapeutic alliance to better understand its role in shaping long-term treatment effects. The absence of formal measures of therapeutic rapport or alliance in the present study also limits our ability to evaluate this hypothesis directly and should be addressed in future research.

DMT was well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events or instances of suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior deemed related to the study drug reported. Most adverse events were mild or moderate, and the most common was infusion site pain. A second dose was associated with fewer adverse events than the first, and most resolved during the dosing visit. No substantial safety concerns were identified in laboratory findings, ECG or vital signs, supporting the overall tolerability of the treatment. Unlike psilocybin, which has been associated with postdose headaches in 40–50% participants in previous studies22, DMT did not appear to reliably induce headaches in this study.

The between-group effect size for the reduction in depressive symptoms at 2 weeks in the present study (d = 0.82) is comparable to the effect size observed in a previous trial of psilocybin (25 mg versus niacin) with psychological support in MDD participants (d = 0.90)23 and greater than the 3-week between-group effect size of psilocybin (25 mg versus 1 mg) in TRD (d = 0.55)24.

Similar to other psychedelic compounds, DMT's AD effects may be linked to its ability to promote neuroplasticity25, its transient—but substantial—impact in brain function in associative regions15,26,27 or (relatedly) to its subjective effects15, with the present results suggesting that reductions in depression were moderated by the intensity of mystical-type experiences induced during treatment (Supplementary Results (Supplementary materials—acute measures and moderation effects of Mystical Experience (MEQ) scores and related measures of the acute psychedelic experience)). Due to its shorter duration of action, IV DMT treatment could offer a more time-efficient, practical and scalable option for psychedelic-based treatments. A recent open-label phase IIa trial using inhaled DMT (escalating 15 mg and then 60 mg) in TRD also reported rapid and sustained AD effects over a 3-month period, with large within-subject effect sizes (for example, g = 2.20 at day 7, g = 1.33 at 3 months)19. While methodological differences make direct comparisons difficult, variations in dose, route of administration and study design, including the use of a placebo control in the present study, may partly account for the somewhat smaller between-group effect size observed at 2 weeks (d = 0.82). Together, these studies highlight the importance of further controlled research to clarify the role of dosing, setting and delivery methods in shaping clinical outcomes.

This study has several limitations. The sample was not ethnically diverse, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Participants with a history of serious suicide attempts were excluded. Additionally, we did not assess blinding integrity or participant expectancy, which may have influenced outcomes, particularly given the distinct subjective effects of DMT. If blinding is compromised, expectations about improvement may influence outcomes, making it harder to isolate pharmacological effects from psychological or contextual ones (although see ref. 28 for evidence suggesting that expectancy may not fully account for psychedelic treatment effects). We explored whether AD washout or prior psychedelic experience influenced AD response at 2 weeks. Neither factor showed an effect, although the small subgroup sizes limit the strength of these conclusions (Supplementary Results (Supplementary analyses on possible effects of antidepressant washout, prior experience with psychedelics and preparation (set, setting, therapeutic rapport and intention) on antidepressant effects)). Moreover, the blinded first dose and the open label nature of the second dose limit the comparisons that can be made between one and two doses. The results of this second phase of the study must thus be interpreted as hypothesis-generating. DMT was administered alongside a time-limited, relational psychotherapeutic framework focused on psychological flexibility. Given the hypothesis of synergistic effects between psychedelic compounds and therapeutic support29, it remains unclear whether similar results would be achieved with minimal psychological support. Formal measures on the quality of psychological integration were also not collected, limiting our capacity to draw conclusions on the influence of the psychological intervention on clinical outcomes.

In this phase IIa trial, a 21.5-mg dose of DMT administered as a 10-min IV infusion with psychological support resulted in a significantly greater reduction in depression at 2 weeks compared with placebo in participants with moderate-to-severe MDD. The treatment demonstrated a rapid onset of effect, with improvements observed as early as the first assessment time point of 1 week, and AD effects were sustained during the 12-week open-label phase. Longer and larger trials, including comparisons with existing treatments, are needed to further evaluate the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of DMT in the treatment of MDD.

This was a phase IIa double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. The sponsor, Small Pharma (now Cybin UK), designed and supported the trial and provided a proprietary pharmaceutical-grade formulation of DMT fumarate (SPL026), which was analyzed for stability and purity. The trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of DMT, administered as a single or double IV dose, to participants with MDD. The trial was conducted at Hammersmith Medicines Research (HMR), MAC Clinical Research (MAC) and Imperial College London Hammersmith Campus under their respective standard operating procedures.

HMR supervised the trial's execution, and independent site raters conducted blinded assessments of participants using validated tools, ensuring raters were unaware of trial-group assignments. Data management and analysis were performed by HMR, reviewed by the sponsor and supplemented with post hoc statistical analyses conducted by the sponsor. Small Pharma, as Sponsor, had full oversight of the clinical trial. Data were collected via an electronic case report form using the Medrio EDC system (latest version at the time of use, 2020–2022).

The trial adhered to International Council for Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The trial protocol was reviewed and approved by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the London–Brent Research Ethics Committee. All participants provided written informed consent. The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04673383) and ISRCTN (ISRCTN63465876), where the clinical study report synopsis is available.

Adults aged 18 years or over with a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe MDD and a history of at least two prior unsuccessful treatment attempts (pharmacological or/and psychotherapeutic) were recruited formally through databases held by the clinical trial sites, informally through social media, and through other sources, which directed participants to a recruitment website. The main exclusion criteria were an immediate family or personal history of psychosis, medically significant health conditions that make a person unsuitable to participate in the trial (as assessed by a physician), a history of serious suicide attempts, a positive pregnancy test, the use of serotonergic psychedelic drugs in the previous 6 months or the suspected or known presence of a pre-existing psychiatric condition (for example, borderline personality disorder) that could jeopardize rapport between the participant and their two trial therapists in light of the protocol-defined limits of available therapist support. Additional details about the trial exclusion criteria are provided in Supplementary Methods (Inclusion and exclusion criteria).

Volunteers initiated contact by emailing the recruitment coordinator after hearing about the trial. Most of the recruited participants referred themselves and some were recruited through patient databases. Candidates were sent a participant information sheet and invited to a telephone screening. Initial assessments of eligibility and suitability were performed by means of a video call. Confirmation of a diagnosis of depression and medical history were obtained from the participant's general physician. Eligible participants then underwent face-to-face physical and mental health assessments (including the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview) with a trial physician, psychiatrist and therapist (visit 1). Assessment with the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D-17) was done by the site psychiatrist; a score of at least 17 (indicating moderate-to-severe MDD) on a scale that ranges from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating greater depression, was required for trial enrollment. Any participants taking AD medication at screening discontinued the use before starting the trial (with the support of a study psychiatrist), with full discontinuation occurring at least 2 weeks before starting a trial medication.

Participants were financially compensated for their time.

The tables use the term sex rather than gender, but this was determined by self-reporting and may reflect gender identity rather than sex assigned at birth. Sex-based/gender-based analyses have not been performed due to overall low sample size. The race/ethnicity categories used followed the FDA's recommendations which are as follows: American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian; Black or African American; Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander; and White. Participants were allowed to self-report and could also designate themselves as multiracial. Ethnicity was separated from race, with the categories—Hispanic/Latino or not Hispanic/Latino. These categories were not used for any inferences or analyses.

The sponsor-initiated trial reported here constitutes part B of a larger study investigating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of DMT fumarate in healthy participants (part A) and participants with MDD (part B). Findings from part A, conducted in healthy participants, have been published previously10,20 and the remainder of this manuscript refers to part B only. Enrolled participants with MDD followed a two-stage, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design, with a planned enrollment of 28 to 36 participants (34 were randomized).

Participants received up to two single IV doses of DMT fumarate or placebo accompanied by a time-limited, relational psychotherapeutic framework focused on psychological flexibility (Supplementary Methods (Therapeutic support)). In stage 1, participant numbers were allocated to blinded treatments (active or placebo) according to a 1:1 randomization schedule prepared by an independent HMR statistician, using SAS statistical analysis software. Two weeks later, in stage 2, participants received a second, open label, dose of DMT, either as their first exposure for those who received placebo in stage 1, defined as PA arm (PA group) or as a second dose for those who received DMT in stage 1, defined as AA arm (AA group). Participants who declined a second dose or were deemed unsuitable for further dosing by the study psychiatrist proceeded to follow-up assessments after their first dose (defined as A- arm). Due to the noticeable psychedelic effects of DMT fumarate, it was likely that both participants and investigators could determine whether a participant had received the active drug or placebo. Despite this, stage 1 of the study adhered to double-blind principles, while stage 2 was conducted as an open-label phase. More information on blinding is provided in the Supplementary Methods (Blinding).

The dosing regimen was based on data from part A and selected for safety and tolerability. The dose administered was 21.5-mg DMT fumarate, infused intravenously over 10 min in two phases—6 mg over the first 5 min, followed by 15.5 mg over the subsequent 5 min (see refs. 10,20 for details). Details of the screening process can be found in Supplementary Methods (Trial visits).

Dosing took place in a controlled inpatient setting, with participants admitted to the ward 1 day prior and discharged the following morning. Preparation involved a 90-min session with two therapists the day before dosing, including orientation to the setting, a guided visualization to promote relaxation and interpersonal safety, and discussion of participant expectations. On dosing day, an additional brief session supported emotional readiness and anticipatory anxiety. Participants received IV DMT in a nonclinical, softly lit room designed to promote calm and containment. They wore eyeshades and noise-canceling headphones and listened to a specially curated, nonverbal ambient music playlist produced by M. Cooper. The music was tailored to follow the experiential trajectory of the DMT session, expansive and immersive during the peak, then gently grounding toward the end. Two therapists were present throughout the session to provide silent, attentive support, while a study psychiatrist remained on site.

Integration was delivered using a relational and participant-led framework developed from previous psilocybin trials. This approach encourages open exploration of emotional, embodied and transpersonal elements of the experience, without prematurely fixing meaning. Integration sessions were conducted in person on day 1 and day 2 postdose, and again on day 15, with therapists helping participants reflect on the psychedelic material and explore how insights could be applied to daily life. Additional follow-up check-ins supported ongoing integration and monitored well-being. Full procedural details for trial visits and the therapeutic framework are provided in the Supplementary Methods (Trial visits and Therapeutic support).

Remote follow-up assessments were conducted 1-week postdose, an in-person visit at day 29 and remote visits 1 month, and 3 months after the final dose. MADRS was assessed (using the SIGMA guide) by a trained independent site rater who was not present during dosing. An overview of the trial is shown in Fig. 1.

In addition to the main trial, an exploratory out-of-study 6-month follow-up visit was performed to monitor long-term outcomes (Supplementary Methods (Trial visits)).

The sample size calculation was based on a two-sided, two-sample t test with equal variance at a significance level of 0.05 and a 1:1 allocation ratio, using data from ref. 30. A sample size of 28 to 36 participants provided 80% to 90% power to detect a 12.5-point mean difference in MADRS score change from baseline.

The primary outcome of this trial was the change from baseline in the MADRS31 score at 2 weeks (day 14; ±2 days) after the first dose. Secondary efficacy measures included MADRS scores assessed at 1 week (day 8; ±1 day) after the first dose and at 1, 2, 4 and 12 weeks after the second dose (day 22; ±1 day, 29; ±2 days, 45; ±2 days and 105; ±5 days). Additional psychometric tools included the BDI-II32 and the Spielberger's STAI-T33. These instruments were used to evaluate broader aspects of mood and anxiety that complement the primary depression-related outcome. Participants who did not receive a second dose but remained in the study completed the same follow-up assessments as other participants. The BDI-II and STAI-T were administered in paper form for self-assessment. MADRS was completed on a paper form by an independent site rater after the SIGMA guide34. Instructions were provided at the top of the first page of each questionnaire. The MEQ35, as well as other subjective measures like Ego Dissolution Inventory36, Emotional Breakthrough Inventory37, 11 Dimensions Altered States of Consciousness38, Psychological Insights Scale39, Challenging Experience Questionnaire40 and Individual-Rated Visual Analog Scales, were used to measure the subjective effects of DMT. These subjective scores were also examined to see if they could predict subsequent AD effects. We also examined whether elements of psychedelic preparation (therapeutic rapport, intentions, set and setting) influenced AD response at 2 weeks using the psychedelic predictor scale41. Exploratory analyses also assessed for possible influence of AD washout and prior psychedelic use on AD effects at 2 weeks. A completed list of the measures collected in this trial, including the ones not reported here, can be found in Supplementary Methods (Complete list of collected measures) and Supplementary Table 1.

Adverse events were recorded throughout the study and categorized by severity (mild, moderate, severe) and relationship to treatment (possibly or unlikely related). TEAEs were those occurring postrandomization—from dosing on day 1 to day 14 (stage 1) or from day 15 to day 105 (stage 2). Day 15 TEAEs occurring before dosing on day 15 were excluded from summary tables. Serious adverse events were defined per regulatory guidelines and managed by the sponsor. Additional details on adverse event collection are provided in the Supplementary Methods (Additional adverse event collection methods). Safety monitoring included blood pressure and heart rate (predose and at 12, 60 and 240 min after dosing), ECGs (predose and at 180 min after dosing) and lab tests. Tolerability was assessed postdose by asking if participants regretted the experience. Injection site assessments recorded pain, tenderness, erythema or induration.

The primary endpoint was the change in MADRS score between the AA and PA groups from baseline to week 2, with the week 1 change as a secondary outcome, assessed using two-sample t tests during the blinded phase (stage 1). Secondary endpoints, including sustained effects of DMT and the potential benefit of an additional dose, were analyzed using an MMRM. The first MMRM analysis compared MADRS score changes at 1 week (day 22), 2 weeks (day 29), 1 month (day 45) and 3 months (day 105) during the open-label phase (stage 2) between participants who received a single DMT dose (PA group) and those who received two doses (AA group). Additional MMRM analyses explored within-participant changes in MADRS scores after each dose in the AA group and assessed whether the timing of the first DMT dose influenced clinical outcomes (Supplementary Results (‘Secondary analysis—MADRS score comparison between PA and AA groups in stage' to ‘Supplementary analysis—MADRS remission rates')). Response and remission rates, defined as >50% reduction in MADRS score and an MADRS score ≤10, respectively, were analyzed using logistic regression adjusted for baseline scores. Changes in BDI-II and STAI-T scores and MADRS scores at the 6-month follow-up (day 224) were summarized descriptively. Moderation effects of the acute psychedelic experience, measured by MEQ scores, on depression severity were explored (Supplementary Results (Supplementary materials—acute measures and moderation effects of Mystical Experience (MEQ) scores and related measures of the acute psychedelic experience) and Supplementary Fig. 2). In response to reviewer feedback, a worst-case scenario sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate robustness against potential nonrandom missingness of data in the open-label phase. These results are presented in Supplementary Results (Imputation analyses for handling missing data) and confirmed the results of the main analyses. All analyses, excluding the moderation effects, were done after the statistical analysis plan had been signed and after the database had been locked. The statistical analyses were done by an HMR statistician, using SAS (version 9.4; moderation effects were analyzed by Imperial College using R, the latest version at the time of analysis).

Traversal Maria Popova Farrar, Straus & Giroux (2026)

A mentor once told me that, when writing a research statement for a professorship, I had to start with the most ambitious pitch I could imagine — and then go ten times bigger. It's tricky enough to do this as a cosmologist, given that the topic of study is the entire Universe. But there is a quest that is more ambitious still: to find out ‘what are we doing here?'

Against the odds: 12 women who beat bias to succeed in science

Against the odds: 12 women who beat bias to succeed in science

“Between the scale of atoms and the scale of stars,” Maria Popova writes in the prologue to her daring book Traversal, “between the time of mayflies and the time of mountains, we exist as proteins lit up with purpose.” And she sets out to investigate just what this purpose is.

Popova is the acclaimed essayist behind the popular blog The Marginalian (formerly known as Brain Pickings). What started as an eclectic weekly newsletter sent out to inspire her colleagues' creativity has ended up in the archives of the US Library of Congress as a gem of cultural heritage.

In Traversal, this incredibly interdisciplinary exploration of knowledge and meaning gets to grow across 600 pages. Whether she is writing about colonialist explorer James Cook, crystallographer Dorothy Hodgkin or novelist Mary Shelley, about poetry, abolitionism or paint, Popova has a way of weaving one story into the next as if the boundaries between disciplines, cultures and centuries do not exist.

An incomparable intellectual who fell through the cracks of history

An incomparable intellectual who fell through the cracks of history

It is one of those books so ambitious in scope and form that it can only succeed — or fail — spectacularly. Traversal succeeds.

Popova's book is, above all, an ode to polymathy, an insistence that knowledge cannot be siloed. Cook appears not just as a mariner but as the leader of an astronomical expedition — to observe the transit of Venus and thus deduce the distance from Earth to the Sun — and as an early ethnographer of Tahitian culture. Hodgkin, the Nobel-prizewinning chemist who mapped the structures of insulin and vitamin B12 using X-ray crystallography, grew up sketching the mosaics she and her parents had excavated at archaeological sites in the Middle East, priming her brain for pattern recognition and her hands for intricacy. Marie Tharp, who discovered the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, appears as both oceanographer and violinist. Alfred Wegener, who proposed the theory of continental drift, started out as an avid adventurer before becoming an atmospheric scientist.

A parasite that may already be living in your brain has the ability to infect the very immune cells designed to eliminate it. New research from UVA Health explains how the body still manages to keep this infection under control.

Toxoplasma gondii is a potentially dangerous parasite that infects warm blooded animals. People are most often exposed through contact with cats, contaminated fruits or vegetables, or undercooked meat. After entering the body, the parasite can spread to multiple organs and eventually settle in the brain, where it can remain for life. Roughly one third of the global population is believed to carry Toxoplasma, yet most people never develop symptoms. When illness does occur, known as toxoplasmosis, it is most serious in individuals with weakened immune systems.

Researchers led by Tajie Harris, PhD, set out to understand how the immune system responds when Toxoplasma invades CD8+ T cells, which are specialized immune cells responsible for killing infected cells.

"We know that T cells are really important for combatting Toxoplasma gondii, and we thought we knew all the reasons why. T cells can destroy infected cells or cue other cells to destroy the parasite. We found that these very T cells can get infected, and, if they do, they can opt to die. Toxoplasma parasites need to live inside cells, so the host cell dying is game over for the parasite," said Harris, the director of the Center for Brain Immunology and Glia (BIG Center) at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. "Understanding how the immune system fights Toxoplasma is important for several reasons. People with compromised immune systems are vulnerable to this infection, and now we have a better understanding of why and how we can help patients fight this infection."

Caspase-8 and the Self-Destruct Defense

Harris and her team discovered that CD8+ T cells rely on a powerful enzyme called caspase-8 to control T. gondii. Caspase-8 plays a central role in regulating immune responses and can trigger a process that causes a cell to self-destruct.

In laboratory experiments, mice that lacked caspase-8 in their T cells developed far higher levels of T. gondii in their brains compared to mice whose T cells produced the enzyme. This happened even though both groups mounted strong immune responses against the infection.

The difference in outcomes was striking. Mice with caspase-8 remained healthy, while those without it became severely ill and died. Examination of their brain tissue showed that their CD8+ T cells were much more likely to be infected by the parasite.

These findings indicate that caspase-8 plays a crucial role in limiting T. gondii inside T cells. The results also add to growing evidence that this enzyme is broadly important in helping the body control infectious threats.

"We scoured the scientific literature to find examples of pathogens infecting T cells. We found very few examples," said Harris, part of UVA's Department of Neuroscience. "Now, we think we know why. Caspase-8 leads to T cell death. The only pathogens that can live in CD8+ T cells have developed ways to mess with Caspase-8 function. Prior to our study, we had no idea that Caspase-8 was so important for protecting the brain from Toxoplasma."

Study Details and Funding

The findings were published in the journal Science Advances. The research team included Lydia A. Sibley, Maureen N. Cowan, Abigail G. Kelly, NaaDedee A. Amadi, Isaac W. Babcock, Sydney A. Labuzan, Michael A. Kovacs, Samantha J. Batista, John R. Lukens and Harris. The scientists reported no financial conflicts of interest.

Funding for the research came from the National Institutes of Health, grants R01NS112516, R01NS134747, R21NS12855, T32GM008715, T32AI007496, T32AI007046, T32NS115657, F30AI154740, T32AI007496 and T32GM007267; a University of Virginia Pinn Scholars Award; a UVA Shannon Fellowship; and UVA's Strategic Investment Fund.

The mathematical mystery inside the legendary '90s shooter Quake 3

Deep within the source code of this online multiplayer game lies an enigmatic number that puzzles and inspires experts to this day

Game developers didn't have it easy in the 1990s. Because they had extremely limited computing power, they had to write their code as efficiently as possible. Consider the first-person shooter Quake III Arena, usually called Quake 3, for example: players navigated a three-dimensional world, so the programmers had to find the cleverest ways to handle 3D graphics and the associated calculations.

Quake 3 released in 1999 and is considered one of the best computer games of its time. It had a lasting impact on the industry. This legacy wasn't so much due to the story, but rather because Quake 3 was one of the first multiplayer first-person shooters. Players could connect their computers via network cables or the internet to compete in real time.

The game's code left a mark too. It included an extremely efficient algorithm that still amazes experts and sparks curiosity among scientists.

To figure out the orientations of objects, characters or other players in three-dimensional space mathematically, you create a vector, which is essentially an arrow that shows direction. To compare vectors, they need to be normalized to the same length, so you have to scale them accordingly. And that's where a tricky calculation comes up: the inverse square root, which is one divided by the square root of a number.

If I asked you to calculate the inverse square root of 26 without a calculator, you'd probably be stuck for a while—and honestly, so would I. Back in the 1990s computers faced the same challenge. Although they could crunch the numbers, the process demanded a lot of processing power—which can mean the calculation takes a lot of time. One problem was the square root itself; another was the division. That's why the Quake 3 programmers hunted for a better way to find this inverse square root. And indeed, their source code revealed an ingenious solution.

What's fascinating is that the developers never advertised their trick. If Quake 3's source code hadn't gone open source, their method might have stayed hidden forever. But once it was released, curious enthusiasts took notice. When they discovered the code snippet for calculating the inverse square root, they were baffled—it was difficult to follow, and the developers' accompanying comments weren't particularly helpful. But gradually people figured out how the code worked.

Today there are many tutorials that guide you step-by-step through the program code. These walkthroughs exploit special features of the C programming language. For example, numbers are stored in computer locations called memory addresses, which are then manipulated. This is a clever way to avoid computationally intensive operations like division. “Think of it like putting the wrong tag on something at the store and it convincing the employee but here it is C we fool,” explained computer scientist Daniel Harrington from the University of Toronto in a presentation.

From a mathematical perspective, the code is easily explained. To determine the inverse square root, you first make a guess at the solution (which is generally incorrect) and then refine that estimate through a set procedure. In this way, it gradually reaches better solutions.

None of this is groundbreaking or new. What is impressive, however, is that usually four to five iterations of the process are needed before the result is close enough to an actual solution. This process requires a lot of computing power. In Quake 3, the starting value—that is, the estimated number used in the first step of the process—was chosen so cleverly that only a single optimization step is necessary.

The optimization steps correspond to the so-called Newton-Raphson method, which approximates the values at which a function produces an output of 0, or the root of functions, over many iterations. This may sound counterintuitive at first, since one wants to calculate the inverse square root and not just any zero. But the programmers employ a trick: they define the function to be approximated as the difference between the initial estimate value and the actual result. Through Newton-Raphson's method, the error thus becomes progressively smaller, allowing one to get ever closer to the exact solution.

To think this through, imagine you want to calculate the inverse square root of 2.5. The algorithm starts with a certain guess: let's say 3.1. To determine the difference from the actual solution, you square the initial value and divide one by the result. If 3.1 were truly the inverse square root of 2.5, then 1 divided by 3.1 squared would be 2.5. The actual result is 0.1. The difference is therefore 2.4.

The Newton-Raphson method reduces this difference over each iteration so that you gradually get closer to the exact value. Typically four to five such steps are needed to arrive at a reliable result. Yet Quake 3 reduced iterations significantly.

The key is in how the starting value for the Newton steps is calculated. The method's algorithm essentially operates in three steps:

Take the given number whose inverse square root is to be calculated and convert it into a corresponding memory address (a location in the computer's stored data).

This value is halved and subtracted from the hexadecimal value 0x5f3759df. This is the starting value for the Newton method.

Next, perform a Newton step.

Particularly mysterious is the cryptic string 0x5f3759df, which has since gone down in computer science history as the “magic number.” It is the reason why only one iteration is necessary to obtain an approximate solution for the inverse square root that produces an error of at most 0.175 percent.

As soon as the program code was available as open source, experts puzzled over the origin of that magic number. In a technical paper published in 2003, computer scientist Chris Lomont wrote: “Where does this value come from, and why does the code work?”

The hexadecimal number 0x5f3759df corresponds to 1,597,463,007 in decimal notation. By breaking down the individual steps of the program code, Lomont realized that he could obtain 1,597,463,007 through certain calculations. To make this math simpler, here's one way to represent the calculation involved:

The values 3⁄2, 223 and 127 come from converting the number representations into C. But 0.0450465's origin is less obvious.

Lomont mathematically investigated which value yields an optimal result for different inputs. In other words: Which starting value best approximates the inverse square root and should therefore lead to the smallest error? He arrived at a value of 1,597,465,647, which is approximately:

This corresponds to the values found in the Quake 3 source code. The result is quite close to the values found there.

When Lomont compared his results with those of the original, he encountered a surprise. In two steps of the Newton-Raphson method, his calculated constant actually worked better: the maximum possible error was smaller than with the value in the original code. "Yet surprisingly, after one Newton iteration, it has a higher maximal relative error," Lomont writes. "Which again raises the question: how was the original code constant derived?"

In his calculation, the computer scientist had only considered which number would theoretically yield the best possible value, neglecting the number of Newton steps. In search of a better constant, Lomont repeated his calculation and optimized for the best possible solution for a single Newton step. He arrived at a value of 1,597,463,174, which is approximately:

When he put this result to a practical test, it actually yielded slightly better results than the magic number in the Quake 3 code.

Lomont noted in his paper that since both constants are approximations, either is a good option in practice. He added that he hoped to meet the original author of the constant to learn how they derived the magic number.

Online communities began a relentless search for this mystery person. Particularly dedicated to this effort was computer scientist Rys Sommefeldt, who first contacted John Carmack, the lead developer of Quake 3. Carmack was unsure of who coded this snippet and could only offer guesses, however.

Sommefeldt contacted some of the most prominent developers of the 1990s, who each suggested other possible authors without claiming authorship for themselves. It now appears that Greg Walsh, who worked for the computer manufacturer Ardent Computer in the late 1980s, introduced the magic number into the inverse square root algorithm. It then found its way into the Quake 3 algorithm via several other individuals. But exactly how the magic number was determined remains unclear to this day.

That's not a particularly satisfying conclusion. Nevertheless, the story of the Quake 3 code—or at least the part that revolves around the inverse square root—is extremely fascinating. It's astonishing how much effort and brainpower went into efficient software programming back then—a trend that's often overlooked today thanks to current computing power.

Researchers at BESSY II have, for the first time, experimentally confirmed that a material can exhibit truly one-dimensional electronic properties. The team studied short chains of phosphorus atoms that naturally arrange themselves at specific angles on a silver surface. By applying advanced measurement and analysis techniques, they separated the signals coming from chains aligned in different directions. This careful work showed that each individual chain behaves as a genuine one-dimensional electronic system.

The findings also point to a dramatic shift in behavior depending on how closely the chains are spaced. When the chains are farther apart, the material acts as a semiconductor. If packed tightly together, however, calculations predict it would behave like a metal.

From Two-Dimensional Materials to One Dimension

All materials are built from atoms that bond together in different patterns. In most solids, atoms connect both within a plane and vertically. Some elements, such as carbon, can form graphene, a two dimensional (2D) hexagonal network in which atoms bond only within a single layer. Phosphorus is also capable of forming stable 2D structures.

Two-dimensional materials have attracted intense interest because of their unusual electronic and optical properties. Theoretical studies suggest that shrinking materials down even further into one-dimensional structures could produce even more remarkable electro-optical effects.

Self-Assembled Phosphorus Chains on Silver

Under carefully controlled conditions, phosphorus atoms can organize themselves into short, straight lines on a silver substrate. Structurally, these lines appear one-dimensional. However, neighboring chains may still interact with one another from the side. Those lateral interactions can alter the electronic structure and potentially disrupt true one-dimensional behavior. Until now, researchers had not been able to clearly measure whether the electrons themselves were confined to a single dimension.

"Through a very thorough evaluation of measurements at BESSY II, we have now shown that such phosphorus chains really do have a one-dimensional electronic structure," says Professor Oliver Rader, head of the Spin and Topology in Quantum Materials department at HZB.

Dr. Andrei Varykhalov and colleagues first created and examined the phosphorus chains using a cryogenic scanning tunnelling microscope (STM). The images revealed short phosphorus chains forming in three distinct directions across the silver surface, each separated by 120 degree angles.

ARPES Reveals True 1D Electronic Structure

"We achieved very high-quality results, enabling us to observe standing waves of electrons forming between the chains," says Varykhalov. The team then mapped the electronic structure using angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) at BESSY II, a technique in which they have extensive expertise.

Predicted Semiconductor-to-Metal Phase Transition

Dr. Maxim Krivenkov and Dr. Maryam Sajedi played a key role in interpreting the data. By carefully separating the contributions from the three differently oriented chain domains, they were able to isolate each chain's electronic signature. "We could disentangle the ARPES signals from these domains and thus demonstrate that these 1D phosphorus chains actually possess a very distinct 1D electron structure too," says Krivenkov.

Calculations based on density functional theory support the experimental results and suggest an important shift as the chains move closer together. Stronger interactions between neighboring chains are predicted to trigger a phase transition from semiconductor to metal as chain density increases. In other words, if the chains form a tightly packed two-dimensional array, the material would behave as a metal.

"We have entered a new field of research here, uncharted territory where many exciting discoveries are likely to be made," says Varykhalov.

Astronomers spot one of the largest spinning structures in the universe

This enormous chain of hundreds of galaxies—a cosmic filament—is twisting through space 400 million light-years away

The first time that University of Oxford astronomer Lyla Jung saw the cosmic configuration on her monitor, she almost didn't believe it was real. But it was—and Jung and her colleagues went on to identify one of the largest rotating structures ever found in space: a chain of galaxies embedded in a spinning cosmic filament 400 million light-years from Earth.

The finding, published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, may give astronomers new insights into galaxies' formation, evolution and diversity, Jung says.

Galaxies are not positioned either randomly or uniformly in the universe; instead they are connected in structures called filaments that link them, together with dark matter, across space. Along with voids—empty spaces that contain very little matter—and groups of hundreds of thousands of galaxies known as clusters, filaments form what astronomers call the cosmic web.

These filaments are the main channels through which matter flows, feeding galaxies and clusters as structures expand. “By studying filaments, we gain insight into how large-scale structure forms and how galaxies acquire their spins,” says astrophysicist Peng Wang of the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, who was not involved in the new study.

In 2021 Wang and his colleagues reported that based on calculations and satellite imagery, several filaments seemed to be rotating. The new study takes a closer look at one of these structures. Using data from the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa, which was helping to map cold hydrogen gas in nearby galaxies, Jung's team found 14 hydrogen-rich galaxies arranged in a thin, 5.5-million-light-year-long structure. That structure was embedded within a filament 50 million light-years long that contains more than 280 galaxies.

The researchers observed that many of the individual galaxies MeerKAT detected were spinning—and, to their surprise, they also found that the entire filament, including the rest of its galaxies, appeared to be rotating in sync with that spin at a speed of about 110 kilometers per second, something astronomers hadn't seen before. “I started doubting if it was real or if I did something wrong in the analysis,” Jung says.

Detecting this phenomenon “is exceptional,” Wang adds, because the observation signal is faint, and overlapping objects along the line of sight can muddy the picture without very careful data collection and modeling.

In later analyses, Jung and her team found that the filament is probably still taking on more material. Many of its galaxies seem to be in the early stages of growth, she says, because they appear rich in the hydrogen that provides fuel for new stars.

One of the most convincing pieces of evidence for the existence of dark matter comes from measurements of galaxies' rotation. Studying the rotation of filaments could also reveal how much dark matter is in them, says astronomer Noam Libeskind of the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam in Germany, who was not involved in the study. By revealing what portion of the universe exists in these filaments, Libeskind says, this study and future ones like it offer “a way of measuring the dark matter content of the universe.”

Chinese research organizations can no longer take part in most of the research grants funded by Horizon Europe, the European Union's €93.5 billion (US$111 billion) research-funding programme. The EU says it is concerned about sharing sensitive technologies with China that could jeopardize the region's security.

Starting this year, organizations based in or controlled by China cannot apply for grants to fund projects involving artificial intelligence, telecommunications such as 5G, health, semiconductors, biotechnology or quantum technologies. China's Seven Sons of National Defence, a group of universities affiliated with the government's ministry of industry and information technology, are also barred from all funding. However, Chinese organizations can still apply for or participate in select research projects related to climate, biodiversity, food and agriculture.

Beatrice Plazzotta, a business analyst for the Europe Commission, which manages the Horizon Europe programme, in Brussels, Belgium, said at a webinar last month: “We are in an economic and geopolitical conjuncture where we have to pay attention to what we do and who we collaborate with.” Plazzotta said the protection of intellectual property (IP) was among the EU's concerns.

China's Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) did not respond to Nature's request for comment about the changes to Horizon Europe eligibility.

Governments have raised issues around technology transfer to China before, including the sharing of technology or knowledge that benefits the Chinese military. The United States has accused China of stealing trade secrets and obtaining IP by forcing foreign companies to join Chinese firms to sell in China, allegations the Chinese government has repeatedly denied. In Europe, there have been a handful of controversial cases in which researchers were collaborating with Chinese institutions that have close ties to China's military.

Horizon Europe documents state that China has initiatives that support the “undesired transfer of IP”. This includes its Made in China 2025 strategy — a ten-year policy aimed at boosting China's technology and manufacturing in areas such as AI, robotics and biotech — which has the stated goal of encouraging cross-border IP licensing. Another is the country's Military-Civil Fusion strategy, which encourages the use and sharing of scientific innovations with its military.

Joy Zhang, a sociologist at the University of Kent, UK, says that Horizon Europe's concerns about IP and information theft are valid, but the response is not. “It sends the wrong signal,” she adds, and does not address the fact that IP theft is more likely to occur among commercial companies, not researchers making cutting-edge discoveries. “I feel this is perhaps a right intention, but a wrong target.”

Horizon Europe began in 2021 and is a successor to the Horizon 2020 programme that ran from 2014 to 2020, which Chinese researchers participated in. Other countries, including the UK and Switzerland, have previously been barred from the programme, owing to political tensions. Both countries can now participate.

A spokesperson for the Europe Commission says that the EU and China have been in negotiations since 2019 about how they would cooperate on research, including new innovations. The goal is to create a “research and innovation ecosystem”, the spokesperson says, and implement conditions for how the EU and China can work together on issues ranging from IP protection to the movement of researchers. In 2023, Chinese organizations were restricted from participating in a subset of Horizon Europe projects, which create products that are close to being ready to market.

Antibodies are central to immune defenses. Despite advances in understanding the mechanisms of antibody generation, a comprehensive model of how intrinsic and external factors shape human humoral responses to viruses has been lacking. Here we apply phage immunoprecipitation sequencing to investigate the effects of demographic factors—including 108 lifestyle and health-related variables—and genetic variation on antibody reactivity to over 97,000 viral peptides in 1,212 healthy adults. We demonstrate that age, sex and continent of birth extensively affect not only the viruses but also the specific viral epitopes targeted by the antibody repertoire. Notably, we find that antibodies against rapidly evolving epitopes of influenza A virus decrease with age, whereas immunoreactivity to conserved epitopes increases. Furthermore, we identify strong associations between antibodies against 34 viruses and genetic variants at HLA, FUT2, IGH and IGK loci, some of which increase autoimmune disease risk. These findings offer a valuable resource for understanding the factors affecting antibody-mediated immunity, laying the groundwork for optimizing vaccine strategies.

Antibodies are central effectors of adaptive immunity and serve as correlates of protection following natural infection or vaccination. The large inter-individual variability in antibody repertoires indicates that antibody production and maintenance are shaped by multiple factors. Family- and population-based studies have revealed marked differences in antibody titers according to sex and age. For example, women exhibit higher titers against human papillomavirus1 and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)1,2 and mount stronger vaccine responses than men3. Furthermore, antibodies against persistent herpesviruses, such as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), tend to increase with age, reflecting cumulative exposure1,2,4,5, whereas antibodies against viruses that primarily infect children (for example, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and varicella–zoster virus (VZV)) typically persist at high levels into adulthood1,2. Additional non-genetic factors associated with antibody levels include socioeconomic status1,2 and smoking4.

Human genetic factors also contribute to variation in antibody responses. Total and virus-specific antibody titers against CMV, EBV and influenza A virus (IAV) have been shown to be heritable2,6. At the genome-wide scale, the HLA locus presents strong associations with antibody titers against numerous viruses, such as EBV, IAV, rubella virus and VZV2,7,8,9,10. Other loci, including IGH, FUT2, STING1 and MUC1, have been associated with responses to IAV, norovirus and polyomaviruses4,11.

Despite these advancements, most studies have focused on a limited number of viruses, hindering a comprehensive understanding of the determinants of humoral immunity across the broad spectrum of viruses infecting humans. Furthermore, although antibodies targeting a single virus can recognize numerous epitopes—the portion of an antigen bound by the immune system—inter-individual variation in epitope reactivity remains poorly characterized, leaving the determinants of viral antigenic specificity largely unknown.

In this Resource, we address these questions using phage immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-seq), a high-throughput approach for assessing antibody–epitope interactions12,13. PhIP-seq has been applied to characterize antibody repertoire changes across diseases5,14 and evaluate humoral immunity to bacteria4,15. A virus-focused implementation, VirScan16, which spans the complete peptidome of all known human viruses, has recently allowed investigation of the impact of measles infection on antibody profiles17 and immune development in neonates18. Using the VirScan library, we profiled 97,978 viral peptides in 1,212 healthy adults and integrated these data with extensive demographic and genetic information. This approach enabled us to characterize differences in the viruses, viral proteins and epitopes targeted by individual antibody repertoires and to identify key factors shaping both the breath and epitope specificity of antiviral humoral immunity.

To assess the viral peptidome-wide antibody repertoire, we performed PhIP-seq on 900 plasma samples from the Milieu Intérieur cohort19, comprising individuals of European ancestry with balanced sex and age distribution (20–69 years; Fig. 1a). To validate our findings and explore population-level differences in humoral immunity, we analyzed an additional 312 samples from the EvoImmunoPop (EIP) cohort20, including 100 and 212 Belgian residents born in Central Africa (AFB) and Europe (EUB), respectively—all male, aged 20–50 years (Fig. 1b). For both cohorts, we used the VirScan V3 library, encompassing 115,753 microbial peptides16. After filtering for unique viral sequences, we retained 97,978 peptides, representing a wide range of viral families and species (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). PhIP-seq read counts for each viral peptide were converted into standardized, batch-corrected Z scores (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Note), which have been shown to correlate strongly with antibody titers16.

In d and g, the solid curve and shaded area indicate the locally estimated scatterplot smoothing curve and 95% confidence interval, respectively.

The total numbers of positive peptides per individual were normally distributed (Fig. 1c,d,f,g), averaging 881 and 1,044 peptides for Milieu Intérieur and EIP individuals, respectively, due to differences in cohort demographics or sampling protocols. Approximately 97% of peptides were positive in <5% of individuals, reflecting individual-specific immunity (denoted private peptides) or false positives4,15 (Fig. 1e,h). We therefore conducted all subsequent analyses on peptides positive in >5% of individuals, requiring at least two peptides to be positive per virus (denoted public peptides). This yielded 2,608 and 3,210 public peptides in Milieu Intérieur and EIP individuals, respectively, originating from 113 viral species, with EBV, IAV and enterovirus B being the most prevalent in both cohorts (Extended Data Fig. 1c).

Given the high sequence identity among some of the peptides tested, cross-reactivity can lead to false-positive signals. To address this, we used the antiviral antibody response deconvolution algorithm (AVARDA), which estimates the breadth of antibody responses for each viral species—defined as the largest number of reactive viral peptides that show low sequence identity—while accounting for cross-reactivity and the unbalanced peptide representation in the PhIP-seq library21. As expected, seroprevalence determined by AVARDA breadth scores was highest for common viruses such as EBV, HSV-1, CMV, rhinovirus B and adenovirus C (Fig. 1i). We validated the resolution, sensitivity and serostatus prediction accuracy of both peptide-level Z scores and virus-level AVARDA breadth scores through extensive comparisons with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and Luminex assays (Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4, Supplementary Note and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Together, these analyses underscore the specificity and sensitivity of PhIP-seq and reveal the remarkable diversity of human antibody repertoires against viruses causing common infections.

We investigated the effects of non-genetic and genetic factors on antiviral humoral immunity by systematically testing their associations with both peptide-level Z scores and virus-level AVARDA breadth scores. This combined approach allowed us to capture inter-individual variation in antigenic specificity and to identify associations that can be missed at the virus level while accounting for between-species cross-reactivity (Supplementary Note). Before conducting the main analyses, we verified whether antibody reactivity scores were associated with the numbers of different B cell subsets in blood or with B cell output from bone marrow (Supplementary Table 3), which could mediate the effects of age or smoking on humoral responses22. No such associations were detected (adjusted P value (Padj) > 0.05; Extended Data Fig. 5 and Supplementary Note), suggesting that the factors examined below act directly on antibody levels.

We first examined the effects of age and sex on the antiviral antibody repertoire in the Milieu Intérieur cohort. As no significant nonlinear effects of age or age × sex interactions were observed, we focused only on linear and additive effects (Methods). Linear regression modeling revealed that age is strongly associated with antibody reactivity against a broad range of viruses (Fig. 2a), consistent with previous studies4,5. Antibodies against 565 peptides increased with age (false-discovery-rate-adjusted P < 0.05; Supplementary Table 4), primarily from the herpesviruses HSV-1, HSV-2 and EBV, which can reactivate throughout life23. These associations were robust to cross-reactivity, as supported by AVARDA (Extended Data Fig. 6a), and were replicated in the EIP cohort for HSV-1 and EBV (Extended Data Fig. 6b–d). The strongest age effects were observed for antibodies targeting HSV-1 envelope glycoprotein D (Extended Data Fig. 6e) and EBV nuclear antigens 3, 4 and 6 (EBNA-3, EBNA-4 and EBNA-6) (Extended Data Fig. 6f). Both peptide-level Z scores and AVARDA breadth scores also showed positive associations with age for hepatitis A virus and Aichi virus A (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 6a), the latter of which is a kobuvirus that was initially isolated during a 1989 gastroenteritis outbreak in Japan and has subsequently been detected in Europe24. Conversely, antibodies against 766 peptides decreased with age, primarily from rhinoviruses, enteroviruses and adenoviruses (Padj < 0.05; Fig. 2a). After accounting for cross-reactivity, AVARDA confirmed age-related decreases for antibodies against rhinoviruses A and B, enteroviruses B and C and adenovirus D (Extended Data Fig. 6a), suggesting higher exposure in younger individuals and/or faster antibody waning in older adults.

The blue line indicates the regression line. i, Amino acid positions of the midpoint of public M1 peptides associated with age within the full IAV M1 protein for the Milieu Intérieur cohort. In c and i, significance and the directions of associations with age are indicated on the y axis and by the direction of triangles, respectively. The triangle color indicates the IAV subtype. The most significant peptides for each epitope are circled and labeled.

Notably, antibodies against different IAV peptides either strongly increase or decrease with age (Fig. 2a,b). In younger individuals, antibodies primarily target amino acid positions 1–100 and 300–400 of hemagglutinin (HA) (for example, peptide 1: βVirScan = −0.029 and PVirScan = 1.48 × 10−19; Fig. 2c,f,g), corresponding to the more variable globular head domain25 (Fig. 2d). By contrast, in older individuals, antibodies preferentially target positions 450–550 within the more conserved stalk domain (for example, peptide 3: βVirScan = 0.023 and PVirScan = 1.11 × 10−21; Fig. 2c,d,f,g). Antibodies showing the greatest decrease with age tend to target the most variable HA peptides (Spearman's ρ = −0.53 and P = 7.4 × 10−5; Fig. 2e), suggesting that antibodies against rapidly evolving viral epitopes wane faster than those targeting more evolutionarily stable epitopes. These observations were validated with Luminex immunoassays (H3N2 head: βLuminex = −0.033 and PLuminex = 4.42 × 10−76; H1N1 stalk: βLuminex = 0.014 and PLuminex = 8.62 × 10−15; Fig. 2h). A similar pattern was observed for the IAV matrix protein 1 (M1) (Fig. 2b,i): antibodies against less conserved positions (200–250) decrease with age (βVirScan = −0.018; PVirScan = 5.90 × 10−6; βLuminex = −0.0068; PLuminex = 4.04 × 10−4), whereas antibodies targeting more conserved positions (150–200) increase (βVirScan = 0.02; PVirScan = 3.33 × 10−10). These effects result in a significant relationship between M1 evolutionary rates and age-related changes in immunoreactivity (Spearman's ρ = −0.70; P = 1.8 × 10−4).

To determine whether these peptide-specific effects were driven by age-related variations in exposure to different IAV strains, we compared antibodies targeting protein domains from the same viral strain. Consistent opposing age effects were observed for the HA head and stalk domains from the same H3N2 strain, particularly in individuals over 40 years of age (A/Victoria/3/1975 HA head: βLuminex = −0.035 and PLuminex = 3.50 × 10−21; stalk: βVirScan = 0.019 and PVirScan = 1.34 × 10−14) and for the same H1N1 strain (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 HA head: βLuminex = −0.012 and PLuminex = 0.013; stalk: βLuminex = 0.014 and PLuminex = 8.62 × 10−15), as well as for M1 domains from the same H1N1 strain (A/Jamesburg/1942 150–200 region: βVirScan = 0.013 and PVirScan = 2.4 × 10−5; 200–250 region: βVirScan = −0.015 and PVirScan = 2.4 × 10−7). Furthermore, although past influenza vaccination was associated with higher total anti-IAV antibody titers in the Milieu Intérieur cohort (β = 0.34; P = 2.62 × 10−14), vaccination was only weakly associated with age (odds ratio = 0.012; P = 0.048), supporting the view that vaccination is unlikely to account for the observed age-related patterns. Notably, the AVARDA breadth score for IAV was not associated with age (Extended Data Fig. 6a), as it aggregates peptides with opposing age effects. Together, these findings indicate that epitope specificity of anti-IAV humoral responses varies with age.

Sex effects were more modest than age effects: 330 peptides showed higher antibody levels in women and 236 peptides showed higher antibody levels in men (Padj < 0.05; Extended Data Fig. 7a and Supplementary Table 4). Accounting for cross-reactivity, AVARDA supported higher reactivity in women for antibodies against CMV, human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) and HHV-6B (Extended Data Fig. 7b). These results suggest higher exposure and/or stronger humoral responses to herpesviruses in women, in contrast with bacterial antibody responses that show no sex differences4. As with age, we observed sex-specific antibody reactivity to different proteins of influenza viruses (Extended Data Fig. 7c,d): women preferentially target the HA protein (βVirScan = −0.71; PVirScan = 1.26 × 10−13; βLuminex = −0.10; PLuminex = 0.038), whereas men showed higher reactivity to M1 (βVirScan = 0.71; PVirScan = 2.10 × 10−14; βLuminex = 0.092; PLuminex = 0.02) and NP (βVirScan = 0.60; PVirScan = 3.55 × 10−10; βLuminex = 0.10; PLuminex = 0.03) proteins from IAV and IBV, respectively. For comparison, we inferred serostatus for M1 from H3N2 and found that 10.0% of women and 16.1% of men were seropositive (odds ratio = 1.72; 95% confidence interval = 1.16–2.57; PVirScan = 0.0077), consistent with previous findings26. As influenza vaccination rates did not differ between women and men in the Milieu Intérieur cohort (20.2 versus 18.6%, respectively; P = 0.51) and vaccines do not typically target the M1 protein, these findings point to intrinsic sex differences in humoral responses to influenza viruses.

To investigate how the antiviral antibody repertoire varies between populations, we leveraged the EIP cohort, comprising individuals born in Central Africa (AFB) or Europe (EUB). Although all samples were collected in Belgium, AFB individuals had relocated to Europe shortly before sample collection (2.45 years before, on average27), implying that differences compared with EUB probably result from previous viral exposures and/or genetic ancestry. Antibody levels against 898 viral peptides were increased in EUB, predominantly from rhinoviruses, adenoviruses and IAV (Padj < 0.05; Fig. 3a), although the significance was weak when considering AVARDA scores (Padj > 0.001). By contrast, higher antibody reactivity in AFB was observed for 647 peptides, of which 61% were derived from herpesviruses. Elevated reactivity in AFB was strongly supported by AVARDA for CMV (β = −14.71; Padj = 1.29 × 10−19), HHV-6A (β = −7.18; Padj = 6.18 × 10−17), HHV-6B (β = −5.49; Padj = 1.34 × 10−10) and HHV-8 (β = −8.44; Padj = 6.93 × 10−20; Extended Data Fig. 8a–c), consistent with previous reports20,28,29. Adjusting the statistical models for genetic determinants of the antiviral antibody repertoire (Supplementary Table 5) had minimal impact on the differences observed between AFB and EUB (Extended Data Fig. 8d), supporting differential viral exposure—rather than genetic ancestry—as the primary driver of population-level variation in antibody repertoires.

Population differences were also evident at the epitope level within individual viral species. Despite similar overall EBV reactivity between populations (Padj > 0.05; Extended Data Fig. 8a), AFB and EUB targeted different EBV peptides (Fig. 3a,b,f). Antibodies from AFB more frequently targeted the EBNA-4 viral protein, whereas those from EUB preferentially targeted EBNA-6. The four EBNA-4 peptides most associated with African origin clustered between amino acid positions 600 and 800 and derived from the AG876 strain, a type 2 EBV strain that is prevalent in Africa30 (Fig. 3b–e). Conversely, EBNA-6 peptides associated with European origin localized to positions 750–850 and derived from the GD1 and B95-8 cosmopolitan strains (Fig. 3f–i). These findings, validated by Luminex immunoassays for both EBNA-4 (β = −1.28; P = 9.12 × 10−14; Fig. 3d) and EBNA-6 (β = 1.02; P = 8.2 × 10−13; Fig. 3h), suggest that population-specific epitope targeting reflects past exposure to distinct EBV strains. Similarly, antibodies against IAV from AFB primarily targeted NP from H1N1, whereas those from EUB favored HA from H3N2 (Extended Data Fig. 8e–g). Collectively, these results reveal population disparities in antibody reactivity against epitopes of common viruses, highlighting the limitations of single-antigen assays to assess seroprevalence in global epidemiological studies.

To identify new non-genetic factors affecting antiviral antibody repertoires, we searched for associations in the Milieu Intérieur cohort with 108 variables related to socioeconomic status, health-related habits, medical history and disease biomarkers (Supplementary Table 3) while controlling for age and sex. Besides weak associations with socioeconomic status and health biomarkers (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Note), the only strongly significant associations were found for tobacco smoking, correlating with antibodies against 134 peptides (Padj < 0.05; Fig. 4a,b) primarily derived from rhinoviruses A and B and enteroviruses A–D. AVARDA confirmed the association between cigarette consumption and antibodies targeting rhinoviruses A and B (β = 0.032; Padj = 1.99 × 10−4). Rhinoviruses are a prevalent cause of the common cold, which occurs more frequently and with greater severity in smokers, although the underlying mechanisms remain debated31,32.

Only variables with an association of Padj < 0.01 are shown. b, −log10(Padj) values and directions of associations between all public peptide Z scores and smoking status in the Milieu Intérieur cohort, separated by viral species (two-sided Wald test).

The dotted red horizontal line indicates the significance threshold (Padj < 0.05). c, Antibody reactivity for the rhinovirus B peptide most significantly associated with smoking status, categorized by smoking status.

In d and e, the blue line indicates the linear regression line and the shaded area represents the 95% confidence interval. MCHC, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration.

These associations with smoking were not reproduced using immunoassays based on whole-rhinovirus lysates (Supplementary Table 1), suggesting that peptide-specific effects are masked when the full rhinovirus peptidome is assessed. Consistently, antibody reactivity was associated with smoking status for only 29% (63 out of 218) of the rhinovirus peptides included in the VirScan library. However, the five peptides most strongly associated with smoking—derived from a rhinovirus polyprotein containing capsid proteins (β > 0.040; Padj < 1.0 × 10−10; Fig. 4c)—included the peptide showing the strongest smoking association in the LifeLines-DEEP cohort (n = 1,443; β = 1.09; Padj = 3.29 × 10−9) using a custom PhIP-seq library4, validating that these associations are both genuine and peptide specific. We found that anti-rhinovirus B reactivity was not associated with smoking duration in active smokers (β = 0.012; P = 0.383; Fig. 4d), suggesting constant, non-cumulative exposure to rhinoviruses. Interestingly, ex-smokers exhibited antibody levels comparable to those of people who had never smoked (β = −0.17; P = 0.084; Fig. 4c). Accordingly, anti-rhinovirus B antibodies decreased with years after quitting smoking in former smokers (β = −0.022; P = 8.74 × 10−3; Fig. 4e). These findings collectively suggest that smoking exerts a strong, yet reversible, effect on the antibody repertoire against rhinoviruses.

To identify genetic factors affecting the antiviral antibody repertoire, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 2,608 public peptide Z scores in the Milieu Intérieur cohort, testing associations with 5,699,237 imputed common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)22 while controlling for age, sex and genetic structure (Methods). The EIP cohort was used as a replication cohort. Given the incomplete coverage of B cell receptor loci by the imputed SNPs, we performed next-generation sequencing of the IGH, IGK and IGL genes in all Milieu Intérieur donors at a depth of ~35× coverage, identifying 30,503 additional common variants. In total, we detected strong genome-wide significant associations for 225 viral peptides at four independent loci, including HLA, FUT2, IGH and IGK genes (P < 1.31 × 10−10; Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 5).

We found associations between HLA variants and antibody reactivity against 112 peptides from 15 viruses, including EBV, HSV-1 and adenoviruses A–F, consistent with previous studies2,4,7,8,9,10 and replicated in the EIP cohort (PEIP < 0.05; Supplementary Table 5). To account for linkage disequilibrium and facilitate comparisons with disease studies, we imputed HLA alleles from genotype data and tested for associations between peptide Z scores and allele dosages. This analysis identified 85 associations (Supplementary Table 6), including HLA-DRB1*04 (β = 0.96; P = 2.0 × 10−16) and HLA-DQA1*03:01 (β = 0.66; P = 2.3 × 10−15) with adenovirus peptides (Fig. 5b,c), as well as HLA-DRB1*13 with EBV peptides (β = 1.04; P = 7.5 × 10−19; Fig. 5d). These alleles have been associated with an increased risk for type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis33, potentially explaining the link between these immune-mediated diseases and EBV or adenovirus infections34,35.

Variants near FUT2 were associated with antibodies against norovirus peptides (β = 0.31; P = 1.10 × 10−10; Extended Data Fig. 9a). Mutations in FUT2 determine the non-secretor phenotype, which confers resistance to norovirus infection and susceptibility to type 1 diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease36,37. The most significant variants include the FUT2 rs601338G>A stop mutation defining the non-secretor status38 (β = −0.31; P = 2.01 × 10−10), the protective allele A being associated with reduced anti-norovirus antibody levels. Variants in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs601338 were replicated in the EIP cohort (PEIP = 5.98 × 10−9; r2 = 0.998). We additionally identified a novel association between variants in near-complete linkage disequilibrium (r2 = 0.995) with rs601338 and antibodies against two salivirus strains for both Milieu Intérieur (β = −0.33; P < 1.58 × 10−14) and EIP (PEIP < 1.36 × 10−10; Extended Data Fig. 9b). Saliviruses, discovered in 2009 in diarrheal samples, are known to cause gastroenteritis39, although their cellular tropism and entry mechanisms remain unclear. Associations between FUT2 non-secretor status and anti-salivirus antibodies are unlikely to reflect cross-reactivity with norovirus, as corresponding Z scores were uncorrelated (Extended Data Fig. 9c,d).

Genetic variation at the IGH locus was associated with 107 peptides from 21 viruses (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 5). This locus encodes the antibody heavy chain and has previously been associated with antibody levels against various bacteria, IAV and norovirus4. Our analyses extended these findings to additional viruses, including herpesviruses (HSV-2, EBV, CMV and HHV-6), RSV, IAV, HBV, coronavirus NL63, rubella virus, sandfly fever Sicilian virus, enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. Several newly identified variants influence IGHV clonal gene usage by V(D)J somatic recombination, as assessed by adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing in a previous study40. For example, we found that a variant associated with anti-rubella antibodies (rs1024350; β = 0.33; P = 1.90 × 10−11) and suggestively associated with anti-IAV antibodies (β = −0.28; P = 5.38 × 10−10) affects IGHV1-69 usage40 (P = 1.14 × 10−16). IGHV1-69 gene usage partially determines the quality of anti-influenza antibodies41 and has been associated with lupus and type 1 diabetes42. Another variant, rs9671760, associated with antibodies against rubella virus (β = 0.37; P = 3.34 × 10−14; Fig. 5e) and sandfly fever Sicilian virus (β = −0.38; P = 1.46 × 10−11; Fig. 5f), regulates IGHV3-64 usage40 (P = 1.32 × 10−8).

The fourth locus included IGK, encoding the κ light chain of antibodies, and was associated with antibody levels targeting adenovirus B peptides (β = 0.81; P = 1.51 × 10−23; Extended Data Fig. 9e). Together, these findings underscore the pervasive impact of host genetic factors, including germline mutations in immunoglobulin genes, on humoral responses to multiple viruses.

Finally, to quantify the relative contributions of demographic (non-genetic) and genetic factors to antibody variability, we estimated the proportion of variance explained by age, sex, smoking and GWAS lead variants for each of the 2,608 public peptides of the Milieu Intérieur cohort. Together, these factors explained an average of 7.39% (range = 0.91–25.50%) of inter-individual variation in antibody reactivity (Fig. 6a). Demographic factors accounted for 3.81% (range = 0.007–20.68%) of the variance, whereas genetic factors contributed to 3.44% (range = 0.48–23.02%) of the variance. These relative contributions varied substantially across viruses (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b): antibody levels against rhinovirus peptides were dominated by age effects (Fig. 2a), those against CMV were dominated by sex and those against EBV were dominated by genetic variation (Supplementary Table 5).

P values for the association with age (beige) and the most significant IGH variant (black) are indicated, separated by RSV strain. Significance and directions of associations are indicated on the y axis and by the direction of triangles, respectively. The dotted red horizontal lines indicate the significance threshold (Padj < 0.05).

We also observed substantial variation in the factors explaining the variance of peptide Z scores for the same virus. For example, antibody reactivity to the HA protein of IAV was predominantly explained by age, whereas anti-M1 antibodies were primarily affected by IGH genetic variation (Extended Data Fig. 10c). Similarly, anti-EBV antibodies targeting the EBNA-5 protein were strongly shaped by HLA genotype, whereas those targeting EBNA-4 and tegument proteins varied primarily in an age-dependent manner (Extended Data Fig. 10d).

A comparable pattern emerged for anti-RSV antibodies, but at the level of a single protein: variance of antibodies against different peptides of the immunogenic glycoprotein G was primarily explained by either age or IGH genetic variants (Fig. 6b). Age-associated peptides derived from RSV strain A, whereas IGH-associated peptides originated from strain B—two phylogenetic RSV lineages differing in the protein G sequence (Fig. 6c). Specifically, antibodies increasing with age primarily target positions 150–200 of protein G in RSV-A (β = 0.016; P = 4.85 × 10−23; Fig. 6d)—a pattern consistent with a previous study43 and replicated in the EIP cohort for EUB individuals only (βEIP = 0.036; PEIP = 0.015; Extended Data Fig. 10e)—whereas antibodies associated with the IGH variant (rs59595881) target positions 225–275 of protein G in RSV-B (β = 0.60; P = 1.11 × 10−12). The position-specific effects of age and genetics are unlikely to be driven solely by differential exposure to RSV, as Europeans are seasonally exposed to both RSV-A and RSV-B44. Overall, these findings indicate that the effects of demographic and genetic factors largely differ among viruses, viral strains, proteins and epitopes targeted by the antibody repertoire.

In this study, we generated a comprehensive dataset of plasma antibody levels against over 97,000 viral peptides, providing a valuable resource to investigate the intrinsic, environmental and genetic factors shaping the antibody repertoire in healthy adults. All of the results can be explored via a dedicated web-based browser (https://mirepertoire.pasteur.cloud/). Among these factors, age had the most profound and widespread effect. Age-related increases in antibody response may reflect higher exposure in older adults (for example, hepatitis A virus and Aichi virus A), reactivation of latent viruses (for example, HSV-1, HSV-2, EBV and CMV) or reinfections by viruses causing recurrent infections (for example, IAV, IBV and RSV). Conversely, age-related decreases probably reflect higher exposure during young adulthood and/or faster antibody waning (for example, rhinoviruses A–C and enteroviruses B and C).

Importantly, our study shows that aging is associated with differential epitope recognition within the same viral protein. For example, anti-IAV antibodies of younger and older adults preferentially target different domains of viral proteins, this pattern persisting within the same viral strains and for the M1 protein, which is not a typical vaccine target. Therefore, our results suggest that these differences are not solely due to age-related disparities in natural or vaccine-induced exposure to diverse viral strains, but reflect the waning and recall of antibodies targeting variable versus conserved influenza epitopes45, respectively. Alternatively, the accessibility of certain viral protein domains may require multiple reinfections to elicit antibodies, consistent with proposed mechanisms for age-related differences in neutralizing titers against HA globular head and stalk domains of IAV46,47. We propose that age-dependent antigenic specificity, observed here across several IAV proteins, may therefore be a broader phenomenon than was previously appreciated. Similarly, we show that sex influences immunodominance, with women's antibodies preferentially targeting the HA protein of IAV and IBV, whereas men's antibodies disproportionally target NP and M1. These differences are unlikely to reflect vaccination rates, which were similar between sexes, although we cannot exclude that women received greater numbers or more recent vaccine doses than men. Further studies are needed to elucidate mechanisms and implications for age- and sex-related differences in influenza infection risk and vaccine response.

Antibody profiles also vary markedly according to the continent of birth, probably due to differences in viral exposure16. Antibodies from individuals born in Central Africa and Europe preferentially target different EBV proteins, suggesting that regional variation in EBV strains30 contributes to population differences in antibody responses at the epitope level. Among environmental factors affecting the antibody repertoire, we identified a strong association between smoking and anti-rhinovirus antibodies, consistent with previous findings4 and the higher risk of common cold in smokers31. Notably, ex-smokers exhibited antibody levels against rhinoviruses comparable to those of people who had never smoked, suggesting that altered viral clearance and/or heightened exposure in smokers are reversible upon smoking cessation.

Finally, our GWAS confirmed that HLA and IGH affect antibody levels against a range of viruses2,4,7,8,9,10 and largely expanded the list of associated viruses by revealing novel associations with herpesviruses 2–6, RSV, HBV, rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, coronavirus NL63 and rubella virus. Sequencing of the immunoglobulin genes was critical in discovering these associations, as well as the association with IGK, since SNP arrays poorly cover these complex regions. We also identified a strong association between antibodies against the recently discovered and poorly understood saliviruses and FUT2, previously linked to norovirus infection, suggesting that saliviruses may exploit similar host infection mechanisms as noroviruses.

Several of these associated genetic variants have previously been linked to increased autoimmune disease risk33,36,37. Individuals with these diseases often show higher seroprevalence for common viruses, leading the authors of previous studies to suggest a causal role of these viral infections in autoimmunity34,35. However, our results suggest that associations between autoimmune conditions and antibody levels against viruses may instead result from a shared genetic etiology that affects both traits independently. Our study also supports the hypothesis of antagonistic pleiotropy, whereby variants that once conferred resistance to infection now predispose to non-infectious immune diseases48. Consistently, HLA and FUT2 alleles associated with antiviral humoral responses and autoimmunity have increased in frequency under natural selection in Europe over the past millennia49. Detailed sequencing-based studies in large biobanks are now required to clarify the role of genetic variation in shaping antibody repertoires in immune disorders.

This study has several limitations. First, although the VirScan library offers broad coverage, it is restricted to linear peptides, potentially missing antibodies recognizing conformational epitopes. Second, antibody cross-reactivity between peptides complicates the precise attribution of responses to specific viruses. Although we addressed this risk by using AVARDA, this method may also lead to false negatives. Third, the large number of tests required to analyze the full viral peptidome, combined with the cohort size, may further increase the false negative rate. Fourth, PhIP-seq does not determine whether antibodies are protective against viral infection, which requires dedicated experiments. Finally, although we identified robust associations between antibody repertoires and non-genetic and genetic factors, these explain only a fraction of inter-individual variation. Longitudinal studies integrating the human viral exposome and virome, alongside genome-to-genome association studies50, are needed to fully elucidate the determinants of human variation in humoral responses to viruses.

Despite these challenges, our study provides high-resolution insights into the widespread effects of age, sex, continent of birth and genetics on the antibody repertoire. Crucially, it reveals that these factors differentially affect antibodies targeting specific epitopes within the same virus or viral protein, deepening our understanding of antibody generation and maintenance. We anticipate that these findings and the accompanying dataset will prompt mechanistic studies of antiviral immunity, with the potential to inform vaccine and therapeutic strategies.

The Milieu Intérieur cohort comprises 1,000 healthy adults recruited to investigate genetic and non-genetic determinants of immune response variation19. Recruitment was conducted in Rennes (France) in 2012–2013 and individuals were selected based on a large set of relatively strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, as described elsewhere19. Of the 900 individuals reported in the present study, 453 are female and 447 are male, ranging from 20–69 years of age. The study has been approved by the Comité de Protection des Personnes—Ouest VI and French Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament. The study protocol, including inclusion and exclusion criteria for the Milieu Intérieur study, has been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov under the study ID NCT01699893. The samples and data were formally established as the Milieu Intérieur biocollection (NCT03905993), with approvals by the Comité de Protection des Personnes Sud Méditerranée and Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés on 11 April 2018. Research participants received compensation.

The EIP cohort comprises 390 healthy adults recruited to investigate human population differences in immune responses. Recruitment was conducted in Ghent (Belgium) in 2012–2013. Of the 312 individuals reported in the present study, 100 individuals reported to be born in Central Africa (AFB; age range = 20–50 years) and 212 reported to be born in Europe (EUB; age range = 20–50 years). AFB and EUB individuals presented no evidence of recent genetic admixture with populations originating from another continent, besides two AFB donors who presented 22% Near Eastern and 25% European ancestries, respectively20. All individuals were negative for serological tests against human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Ghent University, the Ethics Board of Institut Pasteur (EVOIMMUNOPOP-281297) and the French authorities Comité de Protection des Personnes, Comité Consultatif sur le Traitement de l'Information en Matière de Recherche and Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés. Research participants received compensation.

To investigate the virus-specific and viral peptide-specific antibody profiles in the Milieu Intérieur and EIP samples, we used PhIP-Seq using the VirScan V3 library, a pathogen-epitope scanning method combining bacteriophage display and immunoprecipitation. The detailed protocol and VirScan library are described elsewhere16,18. In brief, a library of linear peptides of 56 amino acids each was constructed to cover all UniProt protein sequences of viruses known to infect humans. Peptides were staggered along each protein sequence with an overlap of 28 amino acids. The phage library was inactivated and incubated with plasma samples normalized to total IgG concentration and controls (bead samples) to form IgG–phage immunocomplexes. The immunocomplexes were then captured by magnetic beads, lysed and sent for next-generation sequencing. Two replicates were performed for each individual, to assess reproducibility.

Sequencing reads were processed as in ref. 17, with some modifications. We utilized the Bowtie 2–SAMtools pipeline51,52 to map the sequencing reads of each sample to the bacteriophage library and count the number of reads for each viral peptide. Subsequently, the positivity of each peptide was determined by a binning strategy whereby read counts from blank controls were first used to group the peptides into hundreds of bins so that the counts formed a uniform distribution within each bin. Then, the peptides from plasma samples were allocated into the pre-defined bins and Z scores were calculated for each peptide from each plasma sample. The means and standard deviations used for the Z score calculations were the same for each bin and were computed using the bead control sample read counts for the peptides belonging to that bin. After generating a matrix of 115,753 peptide Z scores for 900 Milieu Intérieur or 312 EIP samples, we discarded peptides from bacteria, fungi and allergens from the VirScan library, resulting in 99,460 viral peptides. Z score values were inverse hyperbolic sine (arcsinh) transformed. In contrast to log transformation, the arcsinh function is convenient when handling overdispersion due to both outliers and zero values, which were common in the VirScan Z score data.

Peptides of poor quality were identified by leveraging discordance across replicates. Z score values missing in only one replicate were set to missing in both replicates. Then, outliers in each replicate were defined as Z scores higher than the 99.5% quantile. The absolute difference in Z score between replicates was calculated for all peptides with an outlier value in at least one replicate. The distribution of absolute differences was bimodal, with the lower peak representing consistent Z scores between replicates and the upper peak representing inconsistent Z scores. The local minimum between the peaks was identified using the optimize function from the stats R package, and outliers were defined as all peptides with absolute differences above this minimum. The Z score values of both replicates for all outlier peptides were then set to missing. The rate of missing values was 1.06% in the Milieu Intérieur cohort and 1.09% in the EIP cohort. Next, peptides with >50% missing values were removed from the dataset, leaving 98,757 for Milieu Intérieur and 98,697 for EIP. Duplicated UniProt entries were removed, leaving 97,975 peptides for Milieu Intérieur and 97,923 for EIP for the remaining analyses.

Missing values were imputed by running a principal component analysis on all Z scores using the pca function from the pcaMethods package (nPcs = 10, scale = ‘uv'), followed by imputation using the completeObs function from the same package. As individual samples were processed in batches on cell culture plates, samples were batch corrected using the ComBat53 function from the sva R package, using plates as the batch variable (Supplementary Note). The final Z scores were generated by calculating the mean of the two replicates for each individual. A peptide was considered significantly positive if the Z scores of both replicates were >3.5. The hit variable was defined as 1 if the peptide was positive, and 0 otherwise. To generate the list of public peptides, the datasets were filtered on peptides significantly positive in >5% of tested individuals for at least two peptides per virus.

Between-species antibody cross-reactivity, unbalanced representation of viruses in the VirScan library and viral genome size can make peptide-level data challenging to interpret in some cases. To address these limitations and compare antibody profiles at the virus species level, we applied AVARDA21, using the code available at https://github.com/drmonaco/AVARDA. Individual VirScan peptides were aligned to each other and to a master library of all viral genetic sequences translated in all reading frames using BLAST. Evidence peptides were VirScan peptides that aligned to the master library with a bit score of >80. For each virus, AVARDA calculated a maximally independent set of unrelated peptides that explained the total reactivity toward this virus. A probability of infection for each virus was calculated using binomial testing, comparing the ratio of the number of positive evidence peptides with the total number of evidence peptides with the fractional representation of the virus in the VirScan library. Finally, cross-reactivity was evaluated by ranking all viruses based on the probability of infection. Pairs of viruses were then iteratively compared, where shared reactive peptides were assigned to the virus with the most substantial evidence of infection based solely on non-shared peptides. Once all peptides were exclusively assigned to a single virus, a final probability of infection for each sample was calculated using the binomial testing procedure described above. Additionally, a breadth score was calculated, defined as the largest number of reactive peptides from a given virus species that did not share any sequence similarities.

Blood was collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-treated tubes, and the plasma was extracted by centrifugation. Total levels of the immunoglobulins IgG, IgM, IgE and IgA were measured with a turbidimetric test on an Olympus AU400 Chemistry Analyzer. The ELISA-based serologies were measured for IgG against the following viruses and antigens: CMV, HSV-1, HSV-2, EBV, VZV, IAV, rubella, mumps and measles (Supplementary Table 1). The data processing steps for the immunoassay-based serology data are described in more detail in ref. 2. The absorbance and emission values collected in each assay were used to call serostatus. The cutoff values used for calling a sample positive or negative were given by the manufacturer and can be found in supplementary table 2 of ref. 2.

Milieu Intérieur plasma samples were tested for antibodies to a broad panel of common respiratory pathogens and routine vaccine-preventable diseases using bead-based multiplex assays. Samples were run at a dilution of 1:200. Plates were read using a Luminex INTELLIFLEX system and the median fluorescence intensity was used for analysis. A five-parameter logistic curve was used to convert median fluorescence intensities to relative antibody units, relative to the standard curve performed on the same plate, to account for inter-assay variation. The antigens included in the 43-plex assay are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

To validate experimental associations between PhIP-seq-based Z scores and age, sex, continent of birth and smoking, the associated peptides were synthesized (Supplementary Table 1) and antibody titers against these peptides were measured by Luminex immunoassay (see next section). Peptide synthesis was performed with automated synthesizers (Genecust) and a tag was added to each peptide according to the standard protocol54, using solid-phase 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry. For the stalk domain of IAV HA, we used a specific chimeric protein, designated as cH6/1, comprising a A/White-fronted Goose/Netherlands/21/1999 (H6HA) head and a A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1HA) stalk55. The sequence coding for cH6/1 was cloned into the pαH vector under the control of the CAG promoter. The construct included a fold-on trimerization domain and hexahistidine tag. The plasmid was transiently transfected in Expi293F (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using PEI Max (Polysciences) as a transfection reagent. One day after transfection, the flask was transferred to 32 °C and 6.5 mM sodium propionate and 50 mM glucose were added. Following incubation, the cell culture supernatant was clarified and the recombinant cH6/11 protein was captured on an Ni-NTA column (Ni-advance HiFli; Protein Ark) and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C until further use.

We validated associations between PhIP-seq-based Z scores and age, sex, continent of birth and smoking by measuring antibody titers against relevant viral peptides using multiplex Luminex immunoassays. To couple viral peptides to MagPlex microspheres, we adapted the protocol from ‘Modification of microspheres with ADH'56 and Wakeman et al.54. The first step comprises modifying the microspheres with adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH; Sigma–Aldrich). The second step comprises coupling the peptides to ADH-modified microspheres. The stock uncoupled microspheres were sonicated and vortexed for 30 s. Subsequently, 2.5 × 106 microspheres (200 µl) were transferred to an Eppendorf tube and washed once with 1 ml 0.1 M 2-(N-morpholino)ethane sulfonic acid (MES) (pH 6.0) using a magnetic separator. The beads were then activated for 2 h on a rotator at room temperature containing 1 ml of 35 mg ml−1 of ADH and 200 µl of 200 mg ml−1 of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (50 mg ml−1; Sigma–Aldrich). The 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride was prepared extemporaneously in 0.1 M MES (pH 6.0) immediately before use. Following activation, the beads were washed three times with 0.1 M MES (pH 4.5) and resuspended in 1 ml of 0.1 M MES (pH 4.5). The beads were stored at 4 °C overnight.

One day after the ADH modification of microspheres, they were washed once with 1 ml of 0.1 M MES (pH 6.0) using a magnetic separator and resuspended in 350 µl of 0.1 M MES (pH 6.0) with 20 µg of each peptide, 10 µl EDC and 10 µl hydroxysulfosuccinimide sodium salt (50 mg ml−1; Sigma–Aldrich). This suspension was incubated for 2 h 30 m in the dark on a rotator. After incubation, the beads were washed twice with 0.1 M MES (pH 6.0) and blocked with 500 µl of 0.1 M MES (pH 6.0) containing 300 µg of each peptide for 1 h at room temperature in the dark in a rotator. After blocking, the beads were washed twice with 0.1 M MES (pH 6.0) and resuspended in 1 ml PBS-TN. The beads were stored at 4 °C. One day after the coupling process, all coupled beads were counted using a TC20 Automated Cell Counter (Bio-Rad). Serum samples were run at a 1:400 dilution. Plates were read using the Intelliflex system at a low detector sensitivity and the median fluorescence intensity was measured.

We assessed the performance of different methods that predict serostatus from the VirScan data by comparing the predicted serostatus with the ELISA-based serostatus obtained in the same 900 Milieu Intérieur donors. We focused on predicting serostatus for four common viruses for which ELISA data were available: CMV, EBV (EBNA-1 and EA-D), HSV-1 and HSV-2 (Supplementary Note and Supplementary Table 2). We considered four alternative approaches: (1) the hit-based heuristic method, which assigns seropositivity for a given virus when the number of hits is >3 or >5 (as in ref. 16); (2) the hit-based optimized method, which involves searching for the number of positive hits for a given virus that maximizes prediction precision and recall; (3) the AVARDA-based optimized method, which involves searching for the threshold value of the AVARDA breadth score for a given virus that maximizes prediction precision and recall; and (4) an elastic net penalized logistic regression trained from a subset of the VirScan Z score data.

To train the elastic net model, we shuffled and split the data into a training set (70% of the data) and a test set (30%) so that the ratio of seropositive to seronegative samples in both sets was the same as in the original data. We only considered VirScan peptide Z scores for the tested virus as features during feature selection. Two complementary approaches were implemented to reduce overfitting: we discarded features with variance lower than a user-specified threshold, defining a first hyper-parameter, and kept the features with univariate association statistics higher than a user-specified percentile, defining a second hyper-parameter. A grid-based approach was used to optimize the two hyper-parameters and the ratio between elastic net L1 and L2 penalty, performing a fivefold cross-validation for each point of the three-dimensional grid. We visually inspected learning curves to ensure the absence of overfitting. Processing and modeling were carried out using Python 3.12.2 and the following packages: numpy 1.26.4, scipy 1.12.0, pandas 2.2.1 and scikit-learn 1.4.1.post1. All of the packages were installed in a conda 24.3.0 environment for reproducibility.

To estimate serostatus for the M1 protein of IAV, for which no ELISA data were available, we fitted a two-component Gaussian mixture to the non-transformed Z scores using the mclust R package, and considered the 95% percentile of the left distribution to be the threshold for seropositivity.

Ten eight-color flow cytometry panels were previously established22 to count blood cell types, including 78 counts for 27 innate immune cell subtypes and 51 adaptive immune cell subtypes. The protocols, panel design, staining antibodies and gating strategies used to acquire and analyze flow cytometry data are detailed elsewhere22. In brief, cells were acquired using two MACSQuant analyzers calibrated with MACSQuant Calibration Beads (Miltenyi Biotec). Generated MQD files were converted to FCS format and analyzed with FlowJo. Then, 313 immunophenotypes (cell counts, cell proportions, median fluorescence intensity values and ratios) were exported from FlowJo, including 78 cell counts used in this study. The exclusion of problematic and outlier values was described previously22. Some 74 donors failed quality control for the T cell panel and were thus excluded. The remaining missing values were imputed by random forest-based imputation using the missForest R package.

To evaluate whether B cell renewal affects antibody levels, we tested the association between all public peptide Z scores and circulating levels of kappa-deleting recombination excision circles (KRECs; that is, excised signal circular DNA segments generated in B cells during their maturation in bone marrow). KRECs serve as surrogates of new B cell output, as they persist in B cells and are diluted with cell division57. KREC quantification was performed as in ref. 58, with some modifications. Whole-blood genomic DNA (1–2 µg) was pre-amplified for 3 min at 95 °C and then 18 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 30 s, in a 50 µl reaction containing primers, 200 µM of each dNTP, 2.5 mM MgSO4 and 1.25 U Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase, High Fidelity (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 1× buffer. The forward and reverse primers were TCAGCGCCCATTACGTTTCT and GTGAGGGACACGCAGCC for signal joint KRECs and CCCGATTAATGCTGCCGTAG and CCTAGGGAGCAGGGAGGCTT for coding joint KRECs, respectively. The probes were CCAGCTCTTACCCTAGAGTTTCTGCACGG (signal joint KRECs) and AGCTGCATTTTTGCCATATCCACTATTTGGAGTA (coding joint KRECs). Columns of 48.48 Dynamic Array Integrated Fluidic Circuits (Fluidigm) were loaded with 5 µl of a mixture containing 2.25 µl of a 1/2,000th dilution of pre-amplified DNA, 2.5 µl of 2× Takyon Low ROX Probe MasterMix (Eurogentec) and 0.25 µl of sample loading reagent. Rows were loaded with an equal mixture of 2× Assay Loading Reagent and 2× Assay Biomark containing only the two primers and the probe specific for each assay. These columns were subjected to 40 cycles of PCR (95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s) in a Biomark HD system (Fluidigm). Coding and signal joint KRECs were normalized to 150,000 cells using quantification of the albumin gene as an endogenous control.

Details about SNP array genotyping of the Milieu Intérieur cohort are available elsewhere22. DNA was extracted from whole blood collected on EDTA using the Nucleon BACC3 Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (RPN8512; Cytiva). The 1,000 Milieu Intérieur individuals were genotyped using the HumanOmniExpress-24 BeadChip (Illumina), and 966 were also genotyped using the HumanExome-12 BeadChip (Illumina). After applying quality control filters, the SNP array datasets from the two genotyping platforms were merged. SNPs that were discordant in genotypes or position between the two platforms were removed, yielding a final dataset containing 732,341 genotyped SNPs. The dataset was then phased using SHAPEIT2 (ref. 59) and imputed using IMPUTE2 (ref. 60), with 1 Mb windows and a buffer region of 1 Mb. After imputation, SNPs with an information metric of ≤0.8, duplicated SNPs, SNPs with a missingness of >5% and SNPs with a minor allele frequency of ≤5% were removed, generating a final dataset of 5,699,237 SNPs. We removed 13 individuals based on relatedness and admixture22. Finally, the dataset was converted to GRCh38 using the LiftoverVcf function from the GATK software package61.

Details about SNP array genotyping of the EIP cohort are available elsewhere20. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from blood collected into EDTA vacutainers, monocytes were removed with CD14+ microbeads, and DNA was isolated from the monocyte-negative fraction using a standard phenol–chloroform protocol, followed by ethanol precipitation. Genotyping was performed in all individuals using the HumanOmni5-Quad BeadChip (Illumina) and whole-exome sequencing was performed with the Nextera Rapid Capture Expanded Exome kit. The SNP array genotyping and whole-exome sequencing data were processed separately and merged. For the SNP array data, SNPs were passed through multiple quality control filters, and SNPs originating from the sex chromosomes were removed. For the whole-exome sequencing data, reads were processed according to GATK Best Practices. Discordant variants between the two datasets were removed before merging the SNP array and whole-exome sequencing datasets. After combining the two datasets, the data were phased using SHAPEIT2 and imputed using IMPUTE2, with 1 Mb windows and a buffer region of 1 Mb. After imputation and additional quality control filtering, 19,619,457 SNPs remained. The dataset was converted to GRCh38 using the LiftoverVcf function from the GATK software package61. Finally, four individuals were removed based on relatedness and admixture20.

Whole-genome sequencing was performed by the Centre National de Recherche en Génomique Humaine at the Institut de Biologie François Jacob. After quality control, 1 µg genomic DNA was used to prepare a library using the Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Library Preparation Kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. After normalization and quality control, qualified libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq X5 platform as paired-end 150 bp reads. One lane of HiSeq X5 flow cell was produced for each sample in order to reach an average sequencing depth of ~30× for each sample. FASTQ files were mapped on the human reference genome version hs37d5, using BWA-MEM with default options62. BAM file integrity was verified and duplicated reads were identified with PicardTools and SAMtools. Reads were realigned and recalibrated with GATK61 version 4.1. Sequencing reads mapping to the HLA, IGH, IGK and IGL loci were extracted from the mapped BAM files. Genotypes were called in each individual with HaplotypeCaller in GVCF mode. Multi-sample genotype calling was performed jointly on combined GVCF files with GATK GenotypeGVCFs. After variant quality score recalibration, variants that passed the tranche sensitivity threshold of 99.0% were selected. Multiallelic sites were split into several biallelic sites with bcftools norm -m-both and variants spanning deletions were filtered out. Genotypes were set to missing if the depth of coverage was <8× or the genotype quality was <20. Based on kinship coefficients estimated with KING63, ten related individuals and one individual detected as contaminated were excluded. Finally, variants with a minor allele frequency of <0.05, a Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium P value of <10−10 (calculated using the HWExact function from the GWASExactHW R package) or a call rate of <0.95 were discarded, resulting in a total of 30,503 common variants near and within immunoglobulin genes.

All statistical associations were tested using multiple regression models. In all models, the dependent variable was either an asinh-transformed VirScan Z score (for a given peptide) or an AVARDA breadth score (for a given virus). The independent variables could be: (1) serological measurements based on ELISA; (2) serological measurements based on Luminex xMAP assays; or (3) age, sex, continent of birth and candidate non-genetic factors, including smoking, diet, past diseases, health biomarkers and anthropometric measures (Supplementary Table 3). The three groups of variables, (1), (2) and (3), were treated as independent families of tests and P values were adjusted for multiple testing accordingly, using the false discovery rate procedure. Tests within the Milieu Intérieur and EIP cohorts were also considered independent. As detailed below, the specific model and complete list of covariates used varied depending on the independent variables being tested.

The effect size of each independent continuous or binary variable was estimated and tested for being non-null (that is, the two-sided alternative hypothesis) using the linear regression model implemented in the glm R function. The β value was used to determine the effect size of the independent variable. When the independent variable was categorical with more than two levels, an analysis of covariance model was applied using the aov R function. In the association analyses of the Milieu Intérieur cohort, age and sex were systematically included as covariates. We also investigated nonlinear effects of age by testing an analysis of variance model that models age as a factor with five ten-year levels. In addition, we tested for age × sex, age × smoking and sex × smoking interactions by adding an interaction term to the linear model. The only analyzed independent variables for the EIP cohort were age and continent of birth. As all individuals in the EIP cohort were male, sex was not used as a covariate in these analyses. When age was used as the variable of interest, the continent of birth was controlled for, and vice versa. To separate genetic from non-genetic effects of continent of birth, we performed an additional analysis that also included genetic variants that influenced the antibody repertoire (Supplementary Table 7; see the section ‘Estimation of the proportion of variance explained' below).

To leverage the high resolution of the VirScan peptide library while accounting for between-species antibody cross-reactivity, we first tested the association between all public peptide Z scores and non-genetic factors and then evaluated whether AVARDA breadth scores for the tested viruses were associated with the corresponding factors. We considered three scenarios: (1) both the Z scores for several peptides of a given virus and the AVARDA score for the same virus were associated with the candidate factor in the same direction, interpreted as a true association; (2) the Z scores for several peptides of a given virus were associated with the candidate factor in the same direction, but the AVARDA score for the same virus was not, interpreted as a false association due to cross-reactivity; and (3) the Z scores for several peptides of a given virus were associated with the candidate factor in opposite directions, but the AVARDA score for the same virus was not associated, interpreted as true associations obscured by opposite epitope-specific effects.

GWAS was conducted on the asinh-transformed VirScan Z scores in the Milieu Intérieur cohort. The EIP cohort was used as a replication cohort. To correct for population stratification, a principal component analysis was run on all SNPs, and the first two principal components were included as covariates. Age was included as a covariate for both cohorts, and sex was included as a covariate for the Milieu Intérieur cohort only. The population of origin was included as an additional binary covariate for the EIP cohort. The GWAS analyses were conducted using the assocRegression function from the GWASTools R package64, using a linear additive model. The genome-wide significance threshold was defined as P = 1.31 × 10−10 (that is, the minimum P value obtained by running the GWAS of the 2,608 peptide Z scores after randomly permuting donor identifiers). Manhattan plots, locusZoom plots and tables were all made using the topr R package65.

HLA allele imputation was done using whole-genome sequencing data of the HLA locus (here defined as position 28–35 Mb in GRCh37), using all variants in the region with a minor allele frequency of ≥5%. Imputation was conducted on the Michigan Imputation Server66, using the four-digit multi-ethnic HLA reference panel (version 2). Association testing was conducted similarly to individual SNP analysis but using HLA allele dosages instead of SNP genotypes.

The proportion of variance explained by demographic and genetic factors was estimated for the VirScan Z scores of the 2,608 public peptides in the Milieu Intérieur cohort. Genetic factors were the most associated SNPs identified through conditional GWAS (that is, by testing associations with all variants while controlling for hitherto identified lead SNPs). This process was continued until no more SNPs with a P value below genome-wide significance (P < 1.31 × 10−10) were identified, leaving a total of 17 SNPs (Supplementary Table 7). Age, sex and smoking were included as demographic factors. The contribution of each of these 20 variables to the variance of each peptide Z score was estimated using the relaimpo R package67.

To estimate evolutionary rates for each residue of the IAV HA and M1 proteins (Fig. 2), HA sequences for all H3 subtypes and M1 sequences for the H5N1 subtype with collection dates between 1 January 1975 and 1 January 2013 were retrieved from the GISAID EpiFlu database on 13 June 2025. Removing sequences with gaps or ambiguities resulted in 4,209 HA sequences and 3,301 M1 sequences. The accession number, virus name, collection date, originating laboratory, submitting laboratory and contributors of each individual sequence can be accessed under the accession codes EPI_SET_250807be (https://doi.org/10.55876/gis8.250807be) and EPI_SET_250807kf (https://doi.org/10.55876/gis8.250807kf), respectively. Normalized evolutionary rates were calculated for each residue with the empirical Bayesian inference from ConSurf-DB68.

All UniProt amino acid sequences used to build the VirScan peptide library for RSV protein G were aligned with the msa function from the msa package69. The 41-amino-acid-long region that was covered by the largest number of UniProt sequences was identified. Based on this shared region, a distance matrix between all UniProt sequences was computed with the DistanceMatrix function from the DECIPHER package70, and complete-linkage clustering was used to obtain a phylogenetic tree using the hclust R function. Strain annotations were then interpolated for all VirScan peptides using the constructed tree.

Chemical inducers of proximity (CIPs) stabilize biomolecular interactions, often causing an emergent rewiring of cellular biochemistry. While the discovery of heterobifunctional CIPs is expedited by rational design strategies, molecular glues have relied predominantly on serendipity. We hypothesized that preexisting ligands could be systematically decorated with chemical modifications to discover compounds that recruit proteins to a composite protein–ligand interface. Using sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange-based high-throughput chemistry (HTC) to install 3,163 structurally diverse building blocks onto ENL (eleven-nineteen leukemia) and BRD4 (bromodomain-containing protein 4) ligands, we screened each analog for degrader activity. This revealed dHTC1, an ENL degrader that recruits CRL4CRBN complex through an extended interface of protein–protein contacts and only engages CRBN after pre-forming the ENL:dHTC1 complex. We also identified dHTC3, a molecular glue that selectively dimerizes BRD4 bromodomain 1 to SCFFBXO3, an E3 ligase not previously accessible for chemical rewiring. Altogether, this study introduces HTC as a facile tool to discover new CIPs and new effectors for proximity pharmacology.

Chemical inducers of proximity (CIPs) include bifunctional small molecules and molecular glues that induce proximity between two targets, rewiring biological circuits in a manner that is difficult to achieve with other pharmacological approaches1,2. The first CIPs were discovered serendipitously by studying the mechanisms of action of natural product immunosuppressants3,4; however, but heterobifunctional chemistries, exemplified by proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), have made it possible to design CIPs prospectively5,6. Molecular glues function as CIPs without needing to bind the target and effector independently; instead, they can form a composite protein–ligand surface that cooperatively stabilizes an interfacial protein–protein interaction7. For example, thalidomide analogs (or immunomodulatory imide drugs, IMiDs)—anticancer agents that function through this mechanism—resurface the E3 substrate receptor, Cereblon (CRBN), to degrade unligandable neosubstrates8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. These drugs highlight the potential for molecular glues to address difficult classes of drug targets, yet prospective approaches to discover molecular glues remain limited.

Lacking modular design principles like bifunctional CIPs, most molecular glues have been discovered through retrospective mechanism-of-action studies1,2. We considered it instructive that several recently discovered molecular glues possess close structural analogs that bind the same target but do not function as glues18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25. In several examples, CIP behavior can be attributed to subtle structural differences that project outward toward the solvent, forming a composite protein–ligand surface that can stabilize an interfacial interaction19,20,25. However, because of the sporadic and primarily serendipitous nature of these discoveries, it is unclear how often structural alterations can confer glue-type activity to a ligand and whether these alterations can be identified prospectively for a preselected target. To address this, we coupled a high-throughput approach for ligand diversification to a phenotypic readout of neomorphic pharmacological behavior—targeted protein degradation—enabling the prospective discovery of structural alterations that convert ligands into CIPs.

To establish an initial proof of concept, we selected SR-0813, a ligand we previously discovered that binds to the YEATS domain of the leukemia target and transcriptional coactivator eleven-nineteen leukemia (ENL)26. As SR-0813 does not affect ENL stability (Extended Data Fig. 1a), we reasoned that high-throughput diversification could be coupled to cellular ENL degradation screens to identify structural modifications that convert it into a CIP. To test this, we used sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx)-based ‘click chemistry' transformations, in which an iminosulfur oxydifluoride group reacts with primary and secondary aliphatic amines to completion in DMSO–PBS mixtures, forming sulfamides or sulfuramidimidoyl fluorides (Fig. 1a)26,27,28,29,30. These mild, biocompatible reaction conditions allow crude products to be tested directly in living cells, thus marrying high-throughput chemistry (HTC) with miniaturized cell-based screens26,29,30.

Source data

We first furnished TM-7 (1), a synthetically simplified analog of SR-0813 (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1b,c), with an iminosulfur oxydifluoride SuFEx hub to afford TM-7 difluoride (2) and sourced a library of 3,163 commercially available amine building blocks encompassing diverse chemical structures, molecular weights and physiochemical properties (Extended Data Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 1). We then synthesized more than 3,000 TM-7 analogs in parallel and screened each crude product for degradation of HiBiT–ENL (Fig. 1a,b, Extended Data Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2)31,32. A total of 93 hits scoring more than 2 s.d. below the mean were promptly resynthesized, retested for ENL degradation in a newly optimized MV4;11 HiBiT–ENL cell line and counterscreened against MV4;11 cells expressing bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4)–HiBiT to remove false positives, as TM-7 itself does not bind BRD4 (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1f,g). One hit, the crude product of TM-7 difluoride and a pyrrolidine spirosuccinimide building block JS-1 (3), selectively decreased HiBiT–ENL signal (Fig. 1c,d and Supplementary Table 3). It was resynthesized and purified to enable further validation, yielding rac-dHTC1 (4) as a 1:1 mix of enantiomers (Supplementary Methods and Fig. 1d).

Using a panel of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, degradation of native ENL was confirmed by immunoblot (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1h) and dose-responsive degradation was assessed by HiBiT, determining half-maximal degradation concentration (DC50) values ranging from 50 nM to 1.85 µM and maximal degradation (Dmax) ranging from 91% to 58% (Extended Data Fig. 1i and Supplementary Fig. 1a). In MV4;11 cells, degradation was observed within 30 min, maximized after 24 h and sustained for at least 5 days (Fig. 1f). Pretreatment with a saturating concentration of the ENL/AF9 YEATS ligand, SR-0813, prevented loss of HiBiT–ENL signal upon rac-dHTC1 treatment (Fig. 1g), which established that on-target engagement of ENL is necessary for its activity. Furthermore, loss of HiBiT–ENL signal could also be rescued by the neddylation inhibitor, MLN4924, and the proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib (Fig. 1g), indicating that rac-dHTC1 prompts proteasome-dependent degradation of ENL through a Cullin–RING ligase (CRL) complex. We used an expression proteomics analysis to evaluate the selectivity of rac-dHTC1 in MV4;11 cells, finding that it exclusively degrades ENL while also decreasing the abundance of proteins encoded by transcriptional ENL target genes (for example, HOXA10 and MYC) (Fig. 1h and Supplementary Table 4), a known effect of ENL degradation in MV4;11 cells26. AF9, a paralog of ENL that is also bound by this chemical series26, was not detected by proteomics; however, an immunoblot analysis confirmed that it can also be degraded by dHTC1 (Extended Data Fig. 1j).

We next used a forward genetic screen to identify the effectors responsible for dHTC1 activity, which was enabled by a dual fluorescence ENL stability reporter (ENL–TagBFP–P2A–mCherry) expressed in KBM7 cells (Extended Data Fig. 2a)33,34,35,36. A ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS)-focused library of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) was screened in these cells for the ability to modify the activity of rac-dHTC1 or SR-1114 (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Figs. 1a and 2b), a CRBN-based ENL/AF9 PROTAC that we previously disclosed26. Consistent with the known mechanisms of CRBN-based PROTACs37, SR-1114 activity was most impacted by sgRNAs targeting CRL4CRBN, the proteasome and the constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 signalosome (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Strikingly, the same machinery was identified for rac-dHTC1, with CRBN being the most substantially enriched hit (Fig. 2a).

Source data

Using population-level CRBN-knockout (KO) MV4;11 cells30, we confirmed that CRBN is required for the degradation of ENL by rac-dHTC1 (Extended Data Fig. 2c). We also tested whether overexpression of CRBN can improve rac-dHTC1 activity in MOLM-13 cells (Extended Data Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 1b), where its activity was found to be relatively weak (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1h,i). Indeed, the potency and depth of degradation were both improved in proportion to the extent of CRBN overexpression (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Furthermore, a saturating concentration of pomalidomide rescued ENL degradation (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 2e), pointing toward a mechanism whereby rac-dHTC1 contacts the IMiD-binding site of CRBN. This would presumably rely on its spirosuccinimide moiety, which bears resemblance to both the glutarimide motif present in thalidomide analogs and the asparagine cyclic imide modification proposed to be a natural degron recognized by CRBN38,39,40.

In vitro, we could demonstrate that the ENL YEATS domain interacts with CRBN–DDB1 (damage-specific DNA-binding protein 1) and the newly reported CRBNmidi construct41 but only in the presence of the compound (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2f). We also used affinity purification–mass spectrometry (AP–MS) to map the interactions of CRBN globally42, which revealed an exquisitely selective and dHTC1-dependent enrichment of ENL, AF9 and other members of the super elongation complex (SEC) (Extended Data Fig. 2g and Supplementary Table 5). Interestingly, we found that dHTC1 did not enrich for any common CRBN neosubstrate targets (using a previously collated list43), nor did it degrade any (Extended Data Fig. 2g,h). This contrasts with SR-1114, which induces degradation of Ikaros-family zinc-finger protein 1 (IKZF1), as we previously reported26.

Several observations indicated that dHTC1 does not function like a conventional CRBN-based degrader. First, using a CRBN engagement assay based on the competitive displacement of the CRBN-based BRD4 PROTAC dBET6 (refs. 44,45,46), we failed to detect target engagement in cells (Fig. 2d). Whereas SR-1114 and the CRBN ligand pomalidomide both blocked dBET6-induced BRD4–HiBiT degradation by engaging CRBN, neither rac-dHTC1 nor its spirosuccinimide building block JS-1 could do so (Fig. 2d). Second, in contrast to the submicromolar affinity we observed for pomalidomide binding to CRBNmidi by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (Fig. 2e), dHTC1 showed weak and nonspecific (that is, unsaturable) binding and an estimated KD of nearly 50 µM (Fig. 2f). To further assess target engagement in vitro, we used a competitive fluorescence polarization (FP) assay that reports on the displacement of pomalidomide–BODIPY from purified preparations of recombinant CRBN–DDB1 (ref. 14). Unlike thalidomide, which showed submicromolar potency in dose–response assays, we did not detect inhibition by rac-dHTC1 until it reached a concentration of 50 µM (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Table 6). Even at this high concentration—orders of magnitude above its DC50—we did not observe complete inhibition of the FP (Fig. 2g). Likewise, JS-1 showed no inhibition of the CRBN FP assay, even at 50 µM (Fig. 2g).

On the basis of these data, we hypothesized that rac-dHTC1 might require a preformed complex with ENL to engage the IMiD-binding site with high affinity. Indeed, addition of purified recombinant ENL YEATS domain to the FP assay shifted the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of rac-dHTC1 from 23 µM to 106 nM (Fig. 2g), resulting in a calculated 220-fold cooperativity α-factor47. By comparison, the thalidomide-based ENL PROTAC, SR-1114, also showed a shift in the presence of ENL YEATS but the cooperativity was substantially lower (α = 2.3) and it was fully capable of inhibiting FP signal in the absence of ENL YEATS (Fig. 2g). In fact, without ENL YEATS, the activity of SR-1114 (IC50 = 155 nM) closely matched its parent ligand, thalidomide (IC50 = 197 nM), highlighting the difference between dHTC1 and traditional CRBN-based degraders that engage CRBN independently.

To evaluate the mechanism of CRBN engagement further, we assessed the dHTC1 structure–activity relationship (SAR) by replacing the sulfamide connection with an amide, yielding rac-dHTC1-amide (5), or with a urea, yielding rac-dHTC1-urea (6). These analogs showed relatively similar binding to ENL in vitro and in cells but neither could provoke ENL degradation (Extended Data Fig. 3a–d). Both analogs showed weak inhibition of the CRBN FP assay—in both the presence and the absence of ENL—and neither compound could mediate ternary complex formation (Extended Data Fig. 3e–g), demonstrating that dHTC1 activity is dependent on its ability to cooperatively engage CRBN. Therefore, we would not expect that its spirosuccinimide modification would yield an active degrader when installed onto ligands for other targets. To test this, we synthesized two bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) ligands and two poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP1/2) ligands harboring JS-1 at previously established exit vector positions, none of which succeeded in degrading their targets (Extended Data Fig. 3h,i).

To further probe dHTC1 SAR, we separated its two enantiomers by preparative supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) and assigned absolute stereochemical configurations using vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Methods). Whereas (S)-dHTC1 (7) was able to elicit potent ENL degradation, (R)-dHTC1 (8) was completely inactive (Fig. 2h and Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). Both enantiomers bound to ENL identically in vitro (KD = 49–52 nM) and in cells (half-maximal effective concentration = 8 µM) and both showed the same weak CRBN engagement as the racemate (Extended Data Fig. 4c–f). However, (S)-dHTC1 showed potent and cooperative engagement of CRBN in the presence of ENL (Extended Data Fig. 4g), resulting in the stereoselective formation of a ternary complex (Extended Data Fig. 4h,i). Therefore, although CRBN shows low affinity for dHTC1 and no detectable binding to ENL up to a concentration of 1 µM, the stable, preformed ENL:(S)-dHTC1 complex can cooperatively engage CRBN with high apparent affinity to induce stereochemistry-dependent ENL degradation.

Interestingly, we observed a strong hook effect for ternary complex formation in vitro using SPR and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assays (Extended Data Fig. 4j,k). This might relate to the lack of cooperativity seen for ENL engagement by dHTC1 (Extended Data Fig. 4i), which contrasts with its highly cooperative engagement of CRBN. However, the observation of a hook effect is context dependent and influenced by the relative concentrations of all three members of a ternary complex48, which may differ between native cellular environments and reconstituted biochemical assays. Therefore, it is unclear how the strong hook effect we observed in vitro is relevant to the cooperative formation of a ternary complex in cells. (S)-dHTC1 produces only a weak hook effect in degradation assays (Fig. 2h and Extended Data Fig. 4a), suggesting that the formation of a ternary complex is favored over the binary complexes under physiologic conditions. Indeed, in the presence of CRBN overexpression, (S)-dHTC1 induces maximal degradation at concentrations spanning more than three orders of magnitude with no apparent hook effect at any time point (Extended Data Fig. 4l). While the racemate produces a stronger hook effect in degradation assays, this occurs only at early time points and high concentrations (Fig. 1f), which could possibly be attributed to competition from the equimolar presence of (R)-dHTC1, which binds to ENL with equal affinity. Given the weak independent CRBN engagement by dHTC1 (Extended Data Fig. 4e), we interpret the totality of data to suggest that degradation by dHTC1 is dependent on the cooperative engagement of CRBN.

The ENL-dependent binding of dHTC1 to CRBN invokes a distinct mechanism of action relative to prior CRBN-based degraders. To further characterize this mechanism, we coupled deep mutational scanning (DMS) of CRBN to a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based assessment of ENL degradation in the presence of rac-dHTC1 or the ENL PROTAC, SR-1114 (Extended Data Fig. 5a–d). Using our previously described DMS library that covers all possible point mutations within 10 Å of the IMiD-binding site of CRBN49, we found that rac-dHTC1 and SR-1114 are sensitive to similar CRBN mutations (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f, and Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). However, several mutations were suggested by the screen to preferentially confer resistance to either rac-dHTC1 or SR-1114, which we validated by immunoblot and flow cytometry (Extended Data Fig. 5g–i).

To investigate how these mutations might impact dHTC1 activity selectively, we determined the cocrystal structure of (S)-dHTC1 bound to CRBN at a resolution of 2.2 Å using CRBNmidi (Extended Data Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 9)41. This showed (S)-dHTC1 occupying the IMiD-binding site of CRBN, positioning its spirosuccinimide moiety within the tritryptophan cage formed by W380, W386 and W400 (Extended Data Fig. 6b). The succinimide of dHTC1 makes hydrogen-bonding interactions with the side chain of H378, backbone carbonyl of H378 and backbone nitrogen of W380, which are all similar to the contacts made by the glutarimide of lenalidomide50. However, apart from the sulfamide making hydrogen-bonding contacts with the side chains of N351 and W400, the remainder of dHTC1, which is responsible for binding ENL, makes minimal contacts with CRBN.

Focusing on mutations that selectively affected the activity of dHTC1 or SR-1114, we found that these residues generally mapped to distinct hemispheres of the IMiD-binding site (Extended Data Fig. 6b). As several of these residues are buried within the IMiD-binding site, we hypothesized that they might reflect differences in the binding mode of the dHTC1 spirosuccinimide compared to traditional glutarimide-based CRBN ligands. To evaluate this, we compared our DMS results to a previously published screen of CC-885, a thalidomide analog that degrades G1 to S phase transition 1 (GSPT1) (Extended Data Fig. 6c)13,49. This comparison indicated that a W386Y substitution, which impacts the activity of dHTC1 but not SR-1114, also does not impact CC-885 activity (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). Likewise, several P352 substitutions that affected the activity of SR-1114 but not dHTC1 also affected CC-885 (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d).

We also identified compound-selective mutations mapping to regions outside of the direct IMiD-binding site. For example, P54 and G61 substitutions, which affect dHTC1 more broadly than SR-1114 (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f), are located far from the IMiD-binding site on another face of CRBN (Extended Data Fig. 6e). Another, H353, which is adjacent to the IMiD-binding site but presents outward into the solvent (Extended Data Fig. 6f), showed varying behavior, with some substitutions impairing dHTC1 but not SR-1114 or CC-885 and others affecting SR-1114 and CC-885 but not dHTC1 (Extended Data Figs. 5e–i and 6c,d). These data pointed to the possibility that the cooperative engagement of CRBN might depend on contacts made outside of the 10-Å radius included in the DMS screen.

To understand how dHTC1 recruits CRBN when bound to ENL, we determined a ternary complex structure of DDB1∆BPB•CRBN•(S)-dHTC1•ENL YEATS by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) refined to a global resolution of 2.6 Å (Supplementary Table 10). To obtain insight into the CRBN–ENL interface, we conducted local refinements focusing on CRBN•(S)-dHTC1•ENL YEATS leading to a resolution of 2.9 Å (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Fig. 7). The amido-imidazopyridine core of dHTC1 inserts into the acetyllysine-binding channel of ENL and makes canonical contacts with F28, H56, H59, S58 and Y78 (Extended Data Fig. 8a)51. The spirosuccinimide of (S)-dHTC1 engages the IMiD-binding site of CRBN but, interestingly, it adopts a slightly different pose in the ternary complex compared to what was revealed by the cocrystal structure of the binary complex (Extended Data Fig. 8b). This suggests that contacts outside of the ligand-binding site contribute to its improved affinity in the presence of ENL and, indeed, our model revealed an extensive interfacial interaction between CRBN and ENL YEATS, with a buried solvent-accessible surface area of ~2,258 Å2 and a high degree of shape complementarity (0.64 out of 1)52. The subtle change in binding pose of the spirosuccinimide warhead—sacrificing a hydrogen bond in the tritryptophan cage and reorientation of the sulfamide (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b)—is likely necessary to accommodate ENL engagement and, in turn, necessitates a rather weak primary affinity for CRBN.

Source data

Interestingly, ENL binds to CRBN primarily along its N-terminal domain, differing from previously reported ternary complex structures of CRBN-based molecular glues, which mostly rely on interactions with the C-terminal domain of CRBN14,15,53. On the basis of this finding, we queried for conformational rearrangements of CRBN that might stabilize its interaction with ENL by superimposing every reported structure of CRBN bound to a molecular glue in the closed conformation (Fig. 3c). This revealed that a peripheral loop in the N-terminal domain of CRBN (amino acids 146–153) is brought closer to the ENL YEATS domain than in any other structure (median root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) = 3.8 Å) and contributes to the high degree of shape complementarity between CRBN and ENL (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 8c).

Protein–protein contacts are widely distributed across the CRBN–ENL binding interface (Fig. 3d–h). CRBN H353, which is solvent exposed in the binary complex structure (Extended Data Fig. 6f), contacts several ENL residues in the ternary complex structure, most notably making a hydrogen bond with ENL E74 where it shows connected density in the EM map (Fig. 3e). Substituting ENL E74 to alanine fully blocked ENL degradation by (S)-dHTC1 while only modestly impacting SR-1114 activity (Fig. 3i,j). The close ENL contacts made by CRBN H353 might explain why the more extended H353R allele was found to disrupt dHTC1 activity in the DMS screen but not SR-1114 (Extended Data Fig. 5h,i). ENL R16 is surrounded by several CRBN residues in the N-terminal domain (F102, F150 and I152) and stacks between CRBN F102 and F150, whose relative positions suggest formation of a cation–π interaction (Fig. 3f). Notably, F150 is located within the loop on CRBN (amino acids 146–153) that shows a substantial conformational rearrangement in the ternary complex with ENL (Fig. 3c). Consistent with this interaction being essential for CRBN–ENL contacts, we found ENL-R16A to be completely resistant to (S)-dHTC1-mediated degradation but sensitive to SR-1114 (Fig. 3i,j). We also observed a cation–π interaction between CRBN Y355 and ENL K72 (Fig. 3g), with the ENL-K72A mutant showing less sensitivity to (S)-dHTC1 but unchanged sensitivity to SR-1114 (Fig. 3i,j). Altogether, these results demonstrate that ENL–CRBN contacts outside of their ligand-binding sites are critical for dHTC1 activity, consistent with a cooperativity-dependent mechanism of CRBN engagement by dHTC1.

We also observed a polar–polar interaction between CRBN Q178 and ENL Q41 (Fig. 3h). Surprisingly, we found that ENL-Q41A is more sensitive to (S)-dHTC1 but equivalently sensitive to SR-1114 and unaffected by other YEATS domain ligands or inactive analogs of dHTC1 (Fig. 3i–k and Extended Data Fig. 8d). These data suggest that the Q41A substitution may assist ENL in making more favorable contacts with CRBN in the presence of (S)-dHTC1. Interestingly, when we compared our cryo-EM model to the isolated crystal structure of ENL (PDB 6HQ0), we observed an inward movement of the loop containing ENL Q41 (amino acids 37–42; backbone r.m.s.d. = 1.9), which is wedged into a groove formed by the CRBN N-lobe (Extended Data Fig. 8e). Compared to other observed CRBN structures, this groove is enlarged by the β-barrel loop of CRBN (amino acids 172–178) moving outward (Fig. 3c), allowing for the formation of a polar–polar interaction between CRBN Q178 and ENL Q41 (Fig. 3h). These movements likely avoid clashes between CRBN and ENL Q41 (Fig. 3l), rationalizing our observation that ENL-Q41A is more readily degraded by dHTC1.

Altogether, these data demonstrate that HTC afforded the discovery of a highly cooperative molecular glue degrader of ENL. Improved physiochemical and pharmacological properties are often cited as a key motivation for the discovery of molecular glues over heterobifunctionals. Therefore, we evaluated dHTC1 alongside SR-1114 in translationally relevant models of AML that require ENL for survival26,54,55. In cell culture, we found that (S)-dHTC1 potently and stereoselectively suppressed the growth of ENL-dependent MV4;11 cells but did not impact ENL-insensitive HL-60 cells (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 8f)54,55. Importantly, (R)-dHTC1 did not impact either cell line and KO of CRBN conferred resistance to (S)-dHTC1 in MV4;11 cells, demonstrating on-target antiproliferative activity (Fig. 4a). (S)-dHTC1 showed greater antiproliferative effects than ENL/AF9 YEATS domain inhibitors in wild-type (WT) MV4;11 cells but not in CRBN-deficient cells, demonstrating that ENL degradation is more effective than inhibition (Fig. 4a). However, as SR-1114 could not sustain ENL degradation beyond 24 h (Extended Data Fig. 8g), it showed weak antiproliferative activity (Fig. 4a). As we previously demonstrated that ENL abundance rebounds to normal levels 24 h after washout of SR-1114 (ref. 26), we can conclude that the less durable degradation of ENL by SR-1114 (24 h versus 5 days for dHTC1) is because of its inferior stability in cell culture—a known liability of the glutarimide scaffold in many CRBN degraders56.

Next, we evaluated the pharmacokinetic behavior of dHTC1 in mice, finding that it shows a highly favorable profile for in vivo experimentation (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 8h,i and Supplementary Fig. 1c,d). After delivery by intraperitoneal injection, a single 50 mg kg−1 dose of (S)-dHTC1 produced a maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) of nearly 50 µM within 20 min (2.5 µM adjusted for 94.9% plasma protein binding, PPB) (Fig. 4b). This exposure of dHTC1 greatly exceeds its DC50 value in MV4;11 cells, whereas the same dose of SR-1114 produces a Cmax that only narrowly reaches its PPB-adjusted DC50 in MV4;11 cells (PPB = 93.9%). These data indicate that dHTC1 afforded a probe with more suitable properties for experimentation in vivo compared to a similarly unoptimized PROTAC.

To assess pharmacodynamics, we used an MV4;11 orthotopic xenotransplantation model of AML and observed stereoselective ENL degradation after three administrations of (R)-dHTC1 or (S)-dHTC1 (50 mg kg−1) (Fig. 4c,d). (S)-dHTC1 stereoselectively inhibited the expression of ENL target genes (Fig. 4d–f and Extended Data Fig. 8j), as defined by the binding of ENL to gene promoters in chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments or by their responsiveness to dTAG-mediated degradation54. Consistent with the prodifferentiation effects of ENL inhibitors and degraders on leukemia cells54,57,58, we also noted an increase in transcription of the myeloid differentiation marker ITGAM (encoding CD11b), which was confirmed by measuring cell surface expression of CD11b in the spleen and peripheral blood (Fig. 4g). Altogether, these data demonstrate that HTC diversification can deliver CIPs with properties that are useful for in vivo studies.

To evaluate the extensibility of this approach, we sought to convert JQ1, a potent and selective BET (BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4) bromodomain ligand59, into molecular glue degraders, several of which have been reported recently23,24,25,34,60,61. JQ1 was first converted to an anilino intermediate through Buchwald–Hartwig amination assisted by a newly reported Pd(COD)(DQ) catalyst62, which was then furnished with an iminosulfur oxydifluoride SuFEx hub to yield JQ1-difluoride (9) facilitated by a silver pentafluorooxosulfate salt (Extended Data Fig. 9a)63. Using the same 3,163 amines that were previously used to discover dHTC1, we synthesized more than 3,000 JQ1 analogs and screened each for the ability to induce BRD4–HiBiT degradation (Fig. 5a,b, Extended Data Fig. 9b and Supplementary Table 11). This produced 82 hits (Fig. 5b), which were retested in triplicate and counterscreened against HiBiT–ENL, as JQ1 does not bind to ENL (Extended Data Fig. 9c,d and Supplementary Table 12). We prioritized two building blocks for follow-up studies, nipecotamide JS-2 (10) and cyclopropylmethanamine JS-3 (11), the latter of which was unintentionally included in the library twice (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 9c). These were used to synthesize and purify dHTC2 (12) and dHTC3 (13), which were confirmed by high-resolution MS and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to be formed by sulfuramidimidoyl fluoride and sulfamide connections, respectively (Fig. 5c). Both compounds induced selective and CRL-dependent degradation of BRD4 (Fig. 5d, Extended Data Fig. 9e,f and Supplementary Table 13). Blockade of BRD4–HiBiT degradation by MLN4924 and carfilzomib was not observed at higher concentrations approaching 10 µM, which we suspect is because of the transcriptional consequences of BET bromodomain inhibition, as JQ1 itself decreases BRD4–HiBiT signal at these high concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 9f). We cannot rule out other explanations, including off-target effects at high concentrations of dHTC2 and dHTC3. Nevertheless, the full rescue of BRD4–HiBiT levels at lower concentrations of dHTC2 and dHTC3 demonstrate that their activity is CRL dependent, motivating effector discovery by forward genetics.

Source data

We performed two orthogonal CRISPR screens to identify the cellular effectors of BRD4 degradation. In the first screen, we leveraged the toxicity of BRD4 degradation to perform a growth-based drug resistance screen in NALM6 cells. As BET degradation elicits stronger antiproliferative effects than bromodomain inhibition46,64, we selected concentrations of each compound that are sufficient to induce BRD4 degradation but show minimal engagement of BRD4 bromodomains (Extended Data Fig. 9g,h). From a genome-scale sgRNA library, we primarily identified members of the UPS, with CRL regulators being shared as hits by both dHTC2 and dHTC3 (Fig. 5e). Subunits of CRL4DCAF16 (DDB1-associated and Cullin 4-associated factor 16) were identified only for dHTC2, whereas F-box protein 3 (FBXO3), a substrate receptor of the Skp1–Cullin–F-box (SCF) complex, was identified only for dHTC3 (Fig. 5e). The SCF regulators, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 L3 (UBE2L3) and Ariadne RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (ARIH1)65,66, were also enriched by dHTC3, albeit to a weaker extant than FBXO3.

In parallel, we performed a FACS-based CRISPR screen using a library of UPS-focused sgRNAs and a dual fluorescence stability reporter for the short isoform of BRD4, BRD4(S) (KBM7 cells expressing a BRD4(S)–TagBFP–P2A–mCherry construct) (Fig. 5f and Extended Data Fig. 9i)33,34,35,36. This experiment independently confirmed CRL4DCAF16 and SCFFBXO3 as being responsible for the activity of dHTC2 and dHTC3, respectively. While FBXO3 was the strongest hit for dHTC3, this screen also identified UBE2L3, ARIH1 and the SCF subunits, Cullin and Skp1. The latter two, which are essential genes, were uniquely discovered by the reporter-based screen, highlighting its ability to query genes that are required for cell survival33,34,35,36. We validated the results for dHTC2 using previously reported DCAF16-KO KBM7 cells (Extended Data Fig. 10a)34. To validate FBXO3 as the effector for dHTC3, we introduced FBXO3 KO in KBM7, MV4;11, NALM6 and HEK293T cells, each of which were resistant to dHTC3 (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 10a–c).

As DCAF16 is already reported to support targeted protein degradation67 and several DCAF16-dependent BRD4 degraders are already known23,25,34, we focused our subsequent efforts on dHTC3 and SCFFBXO3. We first synthesized epi-dHTC3 (14) with a stereochemical inversion known to disrupt BET bromodomain engagement59 and confirmed that it could not induce BRD4 degradation (Fig. 5h,i and Extended Data Fig. 10d). We also developed a splitHaloTag-based proximity assay for FBXO3 and BRD4 to interrogate ternary complex formation in cells68, observing a stereoselective increase in splitHaloTag signal in the presence of dHTC3 that could be suppressed by excess JQ1 (Fig. 5j and Extended Data Fig. 10e).

To further probe this mechanism of ternary complex formation, we tested whether dHTC3 activity could be blocked by iBET-BD1 or iBET-BD2, bromodomain inhibitors that selectively bind to BD1 or BD2 of BET proteins, respectively69. Only iBET-BD1 could block both dHTC3-induced ternary complex formation and BRD4 degradation (Fig. 5j and Extended Data Fig. 10f), despite the ability of dHTC3 to engage both bromodomains, as shown by its blockade of dBET6-induced BRD4 degradation (Extended Data Fig. 10d). In agreement with these data, truncated constructs of BRD4 (ref. 34) showed that dHTC3 could only degrade BD1 fusions, whereas the PROTAC dBET6 could degrade BD1 and BD2 fusions (Extended Data Fig. 10g). Likewise, dHTC3 failed to induce degradation of a tandem bromodomain construct when it harbored an N140F substitution that blocks binding to BD1 (Fig. 5k)70, further confirming it cannot induce degradation through BD2. To determine whether dHTC3 engagement of BD2 is unable to induce ternary complex formation or, alternatively, leads to the formation of a ternary complex that is nonproductive for targeted protein degradation, we again leveraged the splitHaloTag assay. Using BRD4(S) constructs harboring an N140F or N433F substitutions, we found that dHTC3 could only mediate ternary complex formation with BD1 (Extended Data Fig. 10h).

Lastly, we note that dHTC3 did not show a hook effect in BRD4 degradation or BRD4–FBXO3 ternary complex formation assays, providing a preliminary suggestion that it may engage FBXO3 cooperatively through a glue-like mechanism of action (Fig. 5j and Extended Data Fig. 9e). To assess whether this scaffold can engage FBXO3 independently, we tested whether epi-dHTC3, which cannot bind to BRD4, could block dHTC3-induced degradation of BRD4 (Extended Data Fig. 10i). Its inability to block dHTC3 suggests that FBXO3 is not independently liganded by dHTC3 and is likely recruited only to the preformed BRD4(BD1)–dHTC3 complex.

While we and others have shown that HTC can be used to reshape the neosubstrate scopes of E3 ligase ligands13,30,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79, a generalizable solution for the target-centric discovery of molecular glues has remained elusive. Satisfied that ligand binding can, in principle, create surface alterations that cooperatively stabilize a defined protein–protein interaction, we sought a method to discover molecular glues by systematically altering a predefined protein–ligand surface at scale. This was principally inspired by the report of BCL6 and CDK12/cyclin K molecular glue degraders, which were retrospectively found to stabilize protein–protein interactions through surficial ligand modifications absent in their nonglue analogs18,19,20,21,22,80. However, as BCL6 and CDK12/cyclin K appear uniquely susceptible to molecular glue degraders (nearly half of their ligands are also degraders18,80,81), it was unclear whether these examples would be generally instructive.

Previous reports of molecular glues that first bind to a target and then cooperatively engage an E3 ligase have largely relied on serendipity or target-agnostic screens18,19,20,21,22,82,83,84. HTC proved essential for converting ligands into molecular glues, as we found that relatively few modifications could endow ligands with this neomorphic activity. In contrast, previous studies have demonstrated that CIPs can be discovered from a much smaller collection of analogs by appending simple electrophilic handles directly onto a ligand of interest23,24. These covalent handles can be transplanted onto ligands of diverse targets to afford effective degraders, as they possess intrinsic reactivity for the E3 ligase23,24. A differentiating feature of this HTC-based approach is the ability, embodied by dHTC1, to prospectively discover noncovalent molecular glues that rely on interfacial protein–protein contacts that cooperatively stabilize a ternary complex. However, it is also conceptually possible to discover heterobifunctionals using HTC (dHTC2 shows a strong hook effect in degradation assays) and further study is required to determine whether a hit behaves as a molecular glue or heterobifunctional.

SuFEx provided a favorable method for high-throughput ligand diversification, given (1) the wide commercial availability of SuFEx-compatible amine building blocks; (2) the facile and scalable synthetic procedures used for large library builds; and (3) the ability to perform an effector-agnostic screen by testing crude reaction products directly in native living systems. However, as the sulfamide of dHTC1 was essential for its activity, other chemistries will likely yield different hits and it is, therefore, encouraging that additional HTCs are available85,86,87,88,89. DNA-encoded library approaches have identified bifunctional compounds with glue-like cooperativity but they require preselection of both target and effector90,91. It is notable that neither the mechanism of dHTC1 nor the effector for dHTC3 would have been anticipated in advance of these screens, highlighting an advantage of effector-agnostic screening in cells. Furthermore, we envision that HTC could be adapted to cell-based screening assays for neomorphic pharmacology well beyond targeted protein degradation.

Initially, it seemed improbable to screen over 3,000 analogs only to discover a compound operating through the well-established effector, CRBN, especially one with minimal independent affinity for the ligase. However, this finding may inform whether some ligases are more easily co-opted than others. Genetic screens using fusion protein constructs have evaluated this question en masse, comparing hundreds of proteins for their ability to stimulate protein degradation92,93. Like CRBN, FBXO3 scored highly in these screens, suggesting that it may be similarly well disposed to proximity pharmacology92,93. However, several effectors (for example, CRBN, DCAF11, DCAF16, FBXO22 and tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21)) have been overrepresented in reports of small-molecule degraders23,25,34,36,60,67,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101, despite some, like DCAF16, scoring poorly in previous genetic screens92,93. It is interesting to consider other characteristics that might produce these ‘frequent hitters', such as their intrinsic ligandability, covalent reactivity or their overrepresentation in the cellular repertoire of CRL complexes, among other possibilities102. Furthermore, while we did not observe interactions between ENL and 1 µM CRBN, we cannot rule out the possibility that they interact at concentrations higher than those we were able to assess. If so, dHTC1 may exploit a weak native interaction between ENL and CRBN to form a stable ternary complex, which is a common feature of diverse molecular glues103.

One hypothesis is that some proteins may have evolved the capacity to promiscuously engage many interaction partners. CRBN recognizes proteins with C-terminal cyclic imide modifications that are formed from the cyclization of asparagine and glutamine on damaged proteins38. This mechanism of degron recognition might suggest that CRBN is poised to bind a large fraction of the proteome, provided that it is presented with a cyclic imide modification for recognition38—a hypothesis that would be supported by the conditional engagement of CRBN by dHTC1. Our structural studies indicate that CRBN makes concerted movements to accommodate the induced ENL interaction with a high degree of shape complementarity, which is congruent with emerging studies demonstrating that the CRBN surface is highly plastic and capable of accommodating diverse structural degrons42,104,105,106.

On the basis of these data, we might envision efforts to decorate ligands with diverse cyclic imide moieties, regardless of their intrinsic affinity for CRBN, with the intent of discovering protein–ligand complexes that are biased for CRBN capture without necessarily being biased for CRBN affinity. As the degradation of CRBN neosubstrates can be a major concern in the development of CRBN-based degraders16,107,108,109, a lack of independent CRBN affinity is likely a benefit that minimizes the chance of eliciting off-target neosubstrate degradation, as we see for dHTC1. This selectivity and the availability of an inactive enantiomeric control position (S)-dHTC1 favorably as a chemical probe for the study of ENL function in cellular and animal model systems. Notably, such a stereoisomeric control is difficult to develop with thalidomide-based degraders, which are often prone to fast racemization in situ110.

Unlike CRBN, which has a central role in the development of targeted protein degradation, FBXO3 has not been co-opted by small molecules. Several observations point toward dHTC3 functioning as a molecular glue, most notably the lack of an apparent hook effect by dHTC3 and the inability of epi-dHTC3 to block its activity, as well as its unexpected selectivity for BD1 over BD2. We hypothesize that dHTC3 must first engage BRD4 BD1 before engaging FBXO3. However, structural studies will be required to definitively assess this question and molecular glue activity would not rule out the existence of a ligandable pocket on FBXO3. Prior studies have identified FBXO3 as a regulator of inflammatory signaling111,112,113, suggesting that, in the future, it may perhaps be possible to discover FBXO3-dependent degraders that are conditionally activated by inflammatory cell states.

HL-60 cells (gift from the laboratory of J. Bradner), KBM7 cells (gift from the laboratory of T. Brummelkamp) and KBM7 cells harboring a doxycycline-inducible Cas9 (iCas9; gift from the laboratory of J. Zuber) were cultured in 10% FBS in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM). OCI-AML2 (gift from J. Bradner), OCI-AML3 (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ), ACC 582) and Kasumi-1 (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), CRL-2724) were cultured in 20% FBS in RPMI 1640. HB11;19 (gift from the laboratory of A. Yokoyama), Jurkat (gift of the laboratory of M. Bollong) MV4;11 and MOLM-13 (gifts from J. Bradner), NALM6 (given by ChemoGenix, University of Montreal) and EOL1 (DSMZ, ACC 386) cells were cultured in 10% FBS in RPMI 1640. RPE1 (ATCC, CRL-4000), HEK293T (ATCC, CRL-3216) and Lenti-X 293T (Takara Bio, 632180) cells were cultured in 10% FBS in DMEM. All cell lines were confirmed to be free of Mycoplasma at 1-month intervals and never tested positive. All cell lines were cultured in media using heat-inactivated FBS, supplemented with streptomycin and penicillin, and stored in a 37 °C incubator at 5% CO2.

For lentiviral production, Lenti-X 293T cells were seeded in six-well plates or 10-cm dishes and transfected at approximately 80% confluency with 0.6/3.4 μg of target plasmid, 1.7/0.3 μg of psPAX2 (Addgene, 12260) and 0.85/0.15 μg of pMD2.G (Addgene, 12259) using polyethylenimine (PEI; PolySciences). Virus supernatant was collected after 60 h, filtered using a 0.45-μm filter and stored in aliquots for transduction.

To assess drug response, 20 × 104 MV4;11 or HL-60 cells were seeded per well in a non-tissue-culture-treated 96-well plate (VWR) and treated with 0.1% DMSO or increasing concentrations of (R)-dHTC1 or (S)-dHTC1 (39.07 nM, 78.13 nM, 156 nM, 312 nM, 625 nM, 1.25 µM, 2.5 µM, 5 µM and 10 µM). Cells were split 1:10 and fresh drug was added every 3 days. Cell proliferation was measured on day 12 using the CellTiterGlo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega). Drug response was calculated on the basis of luminescence relative to the DMSO-treated samples. The experiment was independently repeated three times in technical replicates and, for each, the average luminescence was calculated. Diagrams show the mean of the three experiments and error bars represent the s.e.m.

The following cell lines were generated bearing an endogenously tagged N-terminal HiBiT–ENL with a GSG tripeptide linker through homology-directed repair: OCI-AML2, OCI-AML3, MV4;11 (WT and CRBN-KO30), MOLM-13, EOL1 and HL-60. All components necessary were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). A Neon transfection system (Thermo Fisher) was used to electroporate cells. Briefly, sgRNA complexes were synthesized by mixing equal volumes of crRNA (2 µl, 160 µM in nuclease-free water, ggcgccagccatggacaatc) and tracrRNA (2 µl, 160 µM) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before Cas9 (2.7 µl, 10 µg µl−1, Alt-R SpCas9 nuclease V3, 1081058) and duplex buffer (1.3 µl; 30 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 100 mM potassium acetate in nuclease-free water) were added. This suspension was incubated at 37 °C for an additional 15 min to form the active RNP complex. The RNP solution (1 µl) was added to single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN; 2 µM in nuclease-free water, gcggcggcggcgagcgacgcggggcccgggggcggggcggggcgccagccatggtgagcggctggcggctgttcaagaagattagcggaagcggagacaatcaagtgaggagcggccgcgccgcccctgcgcagcccgcccggccccct). The resulting mixture is electroporated with 200,000 cells in electroporation buffer and the cells are deposited into antibiotic-free medium, as described above, and allowed to rest in a 37 °C incubator for 24 h before additional antibiotic-containing medium was added. Replicates with the highest overall signal were selected and expanded.

The initial screen (Fig. 1b) was run in MV4;11 cells bearing an N-terminal tagged ENL–HiBiT tag without a GSG linker. Subsequent assays used a redeveloped cell line bearing this tripeptide linker as we found the original HiBiT reporter signal diminished after serial passaging in cell culture. The resulting HiBiT–GSG–ENL reporter (hereafter referred to as HiBiT–ENL) showed improved durability and overall assay performance and was, therefore, used for all subsequent studies. For MV4;11 cells expressing HiBiT–ENL without a GSG linker, the following ssODN was ordered from IDT and used as received: gcggcggcggcgagcgacgcggggcccgggggcggggcggggcgccagccATGGTGAGCGGCTGGCGGCTGTTCAAGAAGATTAGCGACAccgcccggccctccccggtcccggcctccccgctccgcgcccgcccgccc.

HiBiT reporter cells, generated as described above, were seeded into 384-well plates at 20,000 cells per well and treated with the indicated compounds and equivalent concentrations of DMSO for the time indicated in the experiment, usually 3, 24 or 72 h. Levels of HiBiT-tagged proteins were detected by luminescence using the Nano-Glo HiBiT lytic detection system (Promega, N3050). Dose–response curves were plotted in GraphPad (log(inhibitor) versus response (three parameters)) and the data shown were from three or four independent repeats (mean ± s.e.m.).

Intracellular ENL engagement assays were carried out as described previously116. Briefly, an Echo acoustic liquid handler (Labcyte) was used to transfer drug in a ten-point dose–response series (100-nl transfers) to empty wells on a white, tissue-culture-treated 384-well plate. To these wells were added OCI/AML2 cells stably expressing ENL (YEATS)–HiBiT at concentrations of 20,000 cells in 20 µl of medium. The plate was placed on an orbital shaker for 15 s and then placed in a 37 °C incubator for 3 h or a time otherwise indicated, after which each well was treated with 20 µl of Nano-Glo HiBiT lytic detection (Promega, N3050). After this treatment, the plate was mixed with an orbital shaker for 15 s and allowed to rest in the dark for 20 min before luminescence was measured with a Clariostar microplate reader (BMG Labtech).

MV4;11 cells stably expressing an endogenous BRD4 with a C-terminal HiBiT30 were added at a concentration of 20,000 cells in 18 µl of medium and the plate was mixed on an orbital shaker for 15 s. The plate was placed into a 37 °C incubator for 2 h before 2 µl of a 5 µM dBET6 solution in RPMI with 10% FBS was added to each well and the plate was again placed on an orbital shaker for 15 s (final concentration of dBET6: 500 nM); control wells were treated with an equal volume of DMSO in RPMI with 10% FBS. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, each well was treated with 20 µl of Nano-Glo HiBiT lytic detection (Promega, N3050).

BRD4 BD1 homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assays were performed as previously described116. Briefly, assays were executed by combining recombinant protein and synthetic histone peptide in assay buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7, 20 mM NaCl, 0.2% Pluronic F-127 and 0.05% BSA) with 1 nM LanthaScreen Eu anti-His tag antibody (Thermo Fisher, PV5597) and 8.9 nM SureLight allophycocyanin–streptavidin (PerkinElmer, CR130-100). BRD4 BD1 was used at 10 nM and the BRD4 BD1 assay was performed with 13.3 nM tetra-acetylated H4 (BioVision, 7144-01). Next, 5 μl of combined reagents were dispensed into each well of a 1536-well plate (Greiner HiBase) and the drug was added using an Echo 655 acoustic liquid handler (Beckman). Assays were incubated for 2 h before measurement of signal on a PHERAstar plate reader (BMG Labtech; simultaneous dual emission: excitation = 337 nm, emission 1 = 665 nm, emission 2 = 620 nm). HTRF signals (emission ratio at 665 nm to 337 nm) from DMSO vehicle-treated wells (maximum signal) and no-peptide-control wells (minimum signal) were used to calculate the percentage inhibition for drug-treated wells.

First, 100 nM biotinylated ENL YEATS domain, 2 nM Tb (CoraFluor-1)-labeled Streptavidin and 100 nM eGFP–CRBN–DDB1ΔBPB were added in assay buffer (25 mM HEPES–NaOH pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) BSA, 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 and 3 mM TCEP). The reaction mix was added to a 384-well microplate at a total volume of 15 µl per well. Compounds were dispensed using a D300 (Tecan) to the microplate in triplicates of 24 concentrations ranging from 10 µM to 0 µM and normalized with DMSO. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 1 h and read using a PHERAstar plate reader (BMG Labtech). TR-FRET ratios were calculated as 520 nm/490 nm. Ratios were plotted using GraphPad Prism (version 10.3.1).

Lentiviral production was carried out in Lenti-X 293T cells (Takara Biosciences) with cotransfection with pMD2.G and psPAX2 (Addgene, 12259 and 12260) and a lentiviral expression plasmid with PEI. Lentivirus-containing supernatants were collected 48 h and 72 h after transfection, filtered through a 0.45-µm filter and concentrated 20-fold with Lenti-X concentrator (Takara Biosciences). Cell lines were spinfected at 500g for 1 h at room temperature with 8 µg ml−1 polybrene (EMD Millipore). Lentivirus-compatible plasmids with varying CRBN expression promoters (EF-1a, hPGK and UbC) were transduced into HiBiT–ENL MOLM-13 cells. CRBN expressed plasmids by EF-1a and hPGK were selected with puromycin at 2 µg ml−1. CRBN expressed plasmid by UbC was selected with hygromycin at 250 µg ml−1. After selection, WT CRBN, EF-1a CRBN, hPGK CRBN and UbC CRBN were screened in a ten-point dose–response series against rac-dHTC1, (S)-dHTC1, (R)-dHTC1 and SR-1114 (three biological replicates repeated with two independent experiments). HiBiT–ENL was read out after 24 h and HiBiT counts were normalized to DMSO-treated cells.

For adherent cell lines, cells were plated in six-well or 12-well plates at approximately 1 × 106 cells per well and allowed to adhere overnight. For suspension lines, cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells per well and used shortly thereafter. Wells were treated with the indicated compounds for the times indicated in each experiment. Cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 1× RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor (Life Technologies). Lysates were sonicated and centrifuged and the supernatants were collected. Protein concentration in cell lysates was measured using a BCA assay. Then, 25 µg of denatured total protein from each sample was separated by SDS–PAGE using 4–12% Bis–Tris gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20 (TBST) and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C (all antibodies were 1:1,000 in 5% milk in TBST, while GAPDH primary antibody was diluted 1:5,000 in 5% milk in TBST). Bound primary antibodies were incubated in the appropriate secondary antibody (IRDye680 goat anti-mouse: 925-68070, IRDye800 goat anti-rabbit: 926-32211; diluted 1:5000 in 5% milk in TBST). Secondary antibodies were incubated at room temperature for 90 min before washing with additional TBST and were visualized on an Odyssey CLx (LI-COR Biosciences).

Alternatively, MV4;11 CRBN−/− ENL–TagBFP–P2A–mCherry cells rescued with CRBN WT or mutant were seeded in 12-well plates at 1 × 106 cells per ml and treated with DMSO, 1 μM dHTC1 or 1 μM SR-1114 for 6 h. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed for 15 min on ice with RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS) supplemented with Benzonase (25 U per ml) and 1× Halt protease inhibitor cocktail. Following clearance by centrifugation, protein concentration of lysates was determined using a Pierce BCA protein assay (23225, Fisher Scientific) and 30 μg of lysate was prepared using 4× LDS sample buffer (Thermo Fisher) and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol and run on NuPAGE 4–15% Bis–Tris gels (Thermo Fisher). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked for 30 min in 5% milk in TBST at room temperature before incubating with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The following primary antibodies were used: ENL (1:1,000; D9M4B, Cell Signaling Technology) CRBN (1:2,000; gift from R. Eichner and F. Bassermann) and GAPDH (1:2,000; FL-335, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Membranes were then washed in TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies for 45 min at room temperature before further washes and developing with chemiluminescence films. The secondary antibody used was HRP-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch, 111-035-003).

For western blots of xenografted MV4;11 cells, mouse cell depletion was performed on whole bone marrow cells using the mouse cell depletion kit and LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec). RIPA lysis was performed with purified human cells and 25 µg of protein was loaded on 10% Bis–Tris NuPAGE gels with MOPS SDS running buffer (Life Technologies). Samples were transferred on nitrocellulose iBlot 3 transfer stacks (Life Technologies) using the iBlot 3 gel transfer device (Thermo Fisher). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies to ENL (Millipore; 1:1,000 in 5% milk in TBST) or GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technologies; 1:1,000 in 5% milk in TBST). Membranes were washed, followed by incubation with the secondary IRDye 800CW donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1:7,000 in 5% milk in TBST) for 1 h at room temperature, and subsequent washes were performed. Membranes were imaged on a LI-COR imager.

The double-stranded sequence for CRBNmidi was amplified from a previously published plasmid (Addgene, 215330)41. The sequence was cloned into a modified expression vector backbone derived from pET21a (Novagen) with an N-terminal 6×His tag and a C-terminal AviTag. The ensuing plasmid was cotransformed in BL21(DE3) cells (New England Biolabs) with biotin ligase expression vector pBirAcm (Avidity). Cultures were grown at 37 °C in Luria–Bertani growth medium to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.6. Protein expression was induced at 16 °C with the addition of 100 µM biotin and IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM. The culture was harvested by centrifugation following a 16-h incubation and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mM imidazole and 1 mM DTT containing cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche)). Cells were lysed by two passes through a MicroFluidizer at 10,000 psi. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 6,000g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was passed over Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) and the protein was eluted in elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 250 mM imidazole and 1 mM DTT). Elution fractions were buffer-exchanged into 20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0 and 50 mM NaCl using PD10 desalting columns (GE Life Sciences). The protein was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) through a HiLoad Superdex column (GE) on an AKTA Pure (GE).

SPR experiments were performed on a Biacore 8K (Cytiva). A series S streptavidin sensor chip was used for ligand immobilization (Cytiva). Biotinylated ENL_YEATS and biotinylated CRBNmidi were prepared in HBS-EP+ (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA and 0.05% P20, pH 7.4) or PBS-P+ buffer (Cytiva). Ligand immobilization was carried out in flow cell 2 with a series of ligand injections at a flow rate of 5 µl min−1 until the desired density was achieved (700 RU for ENL_YEATS ternary complex, 1,800 RU for ENL_YEATS small-molecule binding and 4,430 RU for CRBNmidi). Flow cell 1 was left blank as a reference. HBS-EP+ buffer with 1% DMSO was used as running buffer and for the preparation of all analyte samples. For samples with CRBN–DDB1 in the eluent, CRBN–DDB1 was serially diluted in either HBS-EP+ and 1% DMSO buffer or HBS-EP+ and 1% DMSO buffer with 1 µM compound. Analytes were serially diluted in polystyrene 96-well plates immediately before injection. Before analyte injection, three startup cycles were run with injections of running buffer over all flow cells. Binding data were collected by injecting the analyte in a single-cycle analysis at a flow rate of 30 µl min−1 over two flow cells (reference and immobilized ligand) at a temperature of 25 °C. The association to biotin–ENL_YEATS or CRBNmidi was measured over 120 s and the dissociation was measured over 1,200 s. Duplicate injections were carried out for each sample, including the blank. Affinity curves, association constants, dissociation constants and sensorgrams were determined using Biacore 8K evaluation software. Curves were plotted in GraphPad (one-site-specific binding) and the data shown are from two or three independent repeats.

Probe displacement from the CRBN–DDB1 complex (performed by Reaction Biology) in the presence or absence of ENL (YEATS) was assessed through FP detection. First, a 9 µM (final 3 µM) solution of ENL (YEATS) was prepared in fresh assay buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM DTT and 0.01% Tween-20). Then, 5 µl of ENL (YEATS) solution or buffer only (for no-ENL controls) was added to assay wells. Compounds were then added to assay wells using an acoustic liquid handler (Echo, Beckman) and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C. Next, a 150 nM (final 50 nM) solution of CRBN–DDB1, prepared in assay buffer, was added (5 µl) to each reaction well, followed by another 20-min incubation at room temperature. Assay buffer was added to blank wells. Lastly, 30 nM solution of BODIPY–thalidomide probe (final concentration: 10 nM; Tenova Pharma, T52674) was prepared in assay buffer and added (5 µl) to assay wells.

After a 90-min incubation at room temperature, FP signal was measured using a PheraStar plate reader (BMG Labtech) with an FP module (excitation: 485 nm, emission: 520 nm (S/P)). The observed signal was blank-corrected and converted to percentage binding relative to DMSO control. IC50 determinations were performed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 software with a sigmoidal dose–response (variable slope) equation or log(inhibitor) versus response (three parameters) curve.

The MS proteomics data were deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium through the PRIDE117 partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD055068.

Treated cells were resuspended in 200 µl of cold DPBS containing protease inhibitor (cOmplete ULTRA tablets mini EDTA-free; Roche, 05892791001; one tablet was dissolved in 10 ml of DPBS before use). Cells were lysed by probe sonication using a Branson Sonifer 250 ultrasonic cell disruptor (2 × 12 pulses, 10% power output). The protein content of whole-cell lysates was determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad, 5000113 and 5000114) with absorbance at 750 nm measured on a CLARIOstar plate reader. A volume corresponding to 200 µg of protein was transferred to a new low-bind Eppendorf tube containing 48 mg of urea and brought to a total volume of 100 µl. Samples were reduced with DTT by the addition of 5 µl of a 200 mM solution (final concentration: 10 mM) and were incubated at 65 °C for 15 min. Samples were next alkylated with iodoacetamide by the addition of 5 µl of a 400 mM solution (20 mM final concentration) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark. Proteins in each sample were precipitated by the addition of cold CH3OH (500 µL), CHCl3 (100 µL) and H2O (400 µL). Samples were vortexed and centrifuged (16,000g, 10 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was aspirated, leaving behind the protein disc, and an additional 1 ml of cold CH3OH was added. The samples were vortexed again and centrifuged (16,000g, 10 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was aspirated and the protein pellet was briefly allowed to air dry. The protein pellet was then resuspended in 160 µl of EPPS buffer (200 mM, pH 8.0) by probe sonication (ten pulses, 10% power output). Proteomes were digested with LysC by the addition of 4 µl of a 0.5 µg µl−1 LysC solution in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade water and the samples were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Proteomes were then digested with trypsin by the addition of 8 µl of a 0.5 µg µl−1 trypsin solution in trypsin resuspension buffer with 20 mM CaCl2 and the samples were incubated at 37 °C overnight. Peptide concentrations were determined using a Micro BCA assay (Thermo Scientific, 23235) and a volume that corresponded to 25 µg was transferred to a new low-bind Eppendorf tube and brought to a total volume of 25 µl with EPPS buffer. To each sample, 9 µl of HPLC-grade acetonitrile was added followed by 3 µl (20 µg µl−1 in dry acetonitrile) of the respective 6plex tandem mass tag (TMT) and the reaction was vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with additional vortexing every 20 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 6 µl of 5% hydroxylamine in H2O, vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Each sample was acidified by the addition of 2.5 µl of LC–MS-grade formic acid. Samples were combined by taking 25 µl of each sample (~12.5 µg of labeled peptide per channel) and vacuum-centrifuged. The combined samples were desalted with a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge and offline-fractionated by HPLC.

Samples were resuspended in 500 µl of buffer A (95% H2O, 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid), vortexed and sonicated in a water bath for 5 min at room temperature. Before loading the sample onto a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters, WAT054955), the column was conditioned with acetonitrile (three times, 1 ml each) and equilibrated with buffer A (three times, 1 ml each). The sample was then loaded onto the column and the flowthrough of the sample was added onto the column again. The sample was desalted by adding buffer A (three times, 1 ml each) and passing it through and the sample was then eluted by the addition of 1 ml of buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 20% H2O and 0.1% formic acid). The eluted sample was collected into a new low-bind Eppendorf tube and was evaporated to dryness using a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator.

The sample was then resuspended in 500 µl of buffer A and fractionated using an Agilent HPLC (Agilent Infinity 1260 II system) into a 96-deep-well plate containing 20 µl of 20% formic acid as previously reported118,119. The peptides were eluted onto a capillary column (ZORBAX Extend-C18, 80 Å, 4.6 × 250 mm, 5 µM) and separated at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1 using the following gradient with buffer A (10 mM aqueous NH4HCO3) and buffer B (100% acetonitrile): 100% buffer A 0–2 min, 0–13% buffer B 2–3 min, 13–42% buffer B 3–60 min, 42–100% buffer B 60–61 min, 100% buffer B 61–65 min, 100–0% buffer B 65–66 min, 100% buffer A 66–75 min, 0–13% buffer B 75–78 min, 13–80% buffer B 78–80 min, 80% buffer B 80–85 min, 100% buffer A 86–91 min, 0–13% B from 91–94 min, 13–80% buffer B 94–96 min, 80% buffer B 96–101 min and 80–0% buffer B 101–102 min. The eluent collected in the 96-deep-well plate was evaporated to dryness using a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator. The peptides were resuspended in 80% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid buffer and combined into 12 fractions (fractions were combined down a column of the plate) by the addition 200 µl of buffer, resuspension by pipetting and combination into the next row. This process was repeated with another 200 µl. Each of the fractions had a final volume of 400 µl and was evaporated to dryness using a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator.

Dried fractions were solubilized in 50 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and desalted using 2-μg-capacity ZipTips (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Peptides were then online eluted into a Fusion Tribrid MS instrument (Thermo Scientific) from an EASY PepMap RSLC C18 column (2 μm, 100 Å, 75 μm × 50 cm; Thermo Scientific), using a hold of 6% solvent B (80:20 acetonitrile and water, 0.1% formic acid) for 15 min, followed by a gradient of 6–28% solvent B in 105 min, then 28–49% solvent B in 15 min, 40–100% solvent B in 10 min, a 10-min hold of 100% solvent B, a return to 5% solvent B in 3 min and finally a 3-min hold of 5% solvent B. The gradient was then extended for the purpose of cleaning the column by increasing solvent B to 100% in 3 min, a 100% solvent B hold for 10 min, a return to 5% solvent B in 3 min, a 5% solvent B hold for 3 min, an increase in solvent B again to 100% in 3 min, then a 100% solvent B hold for 10 min, a return to 5% solvent B in 3 min, a 5% solvent B hold for 3 min, one last increase to 100% solvent B in 3 min and a hold of 100% solvent B for 10 min. All flow rates were 250 nl min−1 delivered using an nEasy-LC1000 nanoLC system (Thermo Scientific). Solvent A consisted of water and 0.1% formic acid. Ions were created at 2.0 or 1.9 kV using an EASY Spray source (Thermo Scientific) held at 50 °C. A synchronous precursor selection MS3 method was selected on the basis of the work by Ting et al.120. Scans were conducted between 380 and 2,000 m/z at a resolution of 120,000 for MS1 in the Orbitrap mass analyzer at a standard automatic gain control (AGC) target (as defined in Thermo Scientific Xcalibur version 4.6.67.17) and a maximum injection of 50 ms. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) was then performed in the linear ion trap of peptide monoisotopic ions with a charge of 2–8 above an intensity threshold of 5 × 103, using a quadrupole isolation of 0.7 m/z and a CID energy of 35%. The ion trap AGC target was also set to standard with a maximum injection time of 50 ms. Dynamic exclusion duration was set at 60 s and ions were excluded after one iteration within the ±10-ppm mass tolerance window. The top ten MS2 ions in the ion trap between 400 and 1,200 m/z were then chosen for higher-energy C-trap dissociation at 65% energy. Detection occurred in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 50,000 and an AGC target of 1 × 105 (or 200% custom setting as defined in Thermo Scientific Xcalibur version 4.6.67.17), with an injection time of 120 ms (MS3). All scan events occurred within a 3-s specified cycle time. The analysis was performed at The Herbert Wertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation and Technology, MS and Proteomics Core Facility (RRID:SCR_023576).

The raw spectrum files were uploaded to the Integrated Proteomics Pipeline (IP2) (http://ip2.scripps.edu/ip2/mainMenu.html) and MS2 and MS3 files were extracted from the raw files using RAW converter and searched using the ProLuCID algorithm against a reverse-concatenated and nonredundant variant of the human UniProt database (2016-07). The precursor ion mass tolerance for a minimum envelop of three isotopic peaks was set to 50 ppm. Cysteine residues were searched with a static modification for carbamidomethylation (+57.02146 Da) and up to two differential modifications were allowed per peptide for methionine oxidation (+15.994915 Da). Lysine and N-terminal residues were also searched with a static modification corresponding to the TMT (+229.1629 Da). Peptides were required to be a minimum of 6 aa long. ProLuCID data were filtered using DTAselect 2.0 within IP2 to allow for a false-positive rate less than 1% at the spectrum level. MS3-based peptide quantification was performed with a reporter ion mass tolerance set to 20 ppm with IP2. Proteins were required to have at least two unique peptides. Peptide-spectrum matches were grouped on the basis of protein identifier and peptides were excluded if (1) the sum of the reporter ion intensities was less than 10,000; (2) the coefficient of variance was greater than 0.5, or (3) they were nonunique or nontryptic peptide sequences. Proteins were quantified by summing the reporter ion intensities across all matching peptide-spectrum matches and normalizing to the highest signal channel per protein. Plots were generated with the log2 fold change of the quotient of DMSO-treated cells with drug-treated cells and the inverse log10 of a two-tailed Student's t-test.

Typical and asymmetrical targeted genes were previously determined by ChIP-seq26. dTAG-responsive genes were also previously defined by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) following dTAG-13-mediated degradation of ENL54. These are categorized separately in Fig. 4e, whereas the combined list is used in Fig. 1h.

These studies were approved by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and were carried out with compliance to all ethical regulations. The mice were housed in cages within the Optimize rack system at a temperature of 72 ± 2 °F, a relative humidity of 35–55% and a photoperiod of 12 h of light and 12 h of dark. Studies were conducted in 6–8-week-old female NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ mice under IACUC protocol number 16-021 at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. A total of 1 × 106 MV4;11 cells were intravenously injected per mouse and engraftment was confirmed in the peripheral blood by flow-cytometry-based detection of human CD45+ cells using an LSR Fortessa, BD Biosciences (human CD45–PE, clone HI30, 1:200; mouse CD45–APC–Cy7, clone 30-F11, 1:100; BioLegend). Upon confirmation of engraftment, mice were randomly assigned to treatment groups and received three doses of (R)-dHTC1, (S)-dHTC1 (50 mg kg−1 intraperitoneally every 12 h) or vehicle. The compounds were dissolved in 5% DMAC and 95% PEG-300 (40%) + NaCl (0.9%) (60%).

Mice were killed 1 h after the last dosing using CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation. Bone marrow cells were isolated from tibias, femurs, iliac crest and spine by crushing the bones with a mortar and pestle in PBS (Life Technologies) + 2% FBS (Life Technologies) and passing the cell suspension through a 40-µm cell strainer (Falcon). Spleens were smashed using a syringe plunger and passed through a 40-µm cell strainer (Falcon). Blood was collected by cardiac puncture and red blood cell (RBC) lysis was performed using RBC lysis buffer (BioLegend). The differentiation status of bone marrow, spleen and blood cells was assessed by flow cytometry (LSR Fortessa, BD Biosciences) using the following antibodies: human CD45–PE, clone HI30, 1:200; mouse CD45–APC–Cy7, clone 30-F11, 1:100; human CD11b-FITC, clone ICRF44, 1:100 (BioLegend).

Mice were housed in the DMPK animal facility in Building A of Shanghai ChemPartner.

The room environment was well controlled: ventilating at least 15 times per hour, light 12 h per day, temperature of approximately 20–24 °C and humidity of approximately 40–70%. The study rooms were disinfected and cleaned before the start of the study and the operation area was cleaned after each dosing or sampling during the study conduct. Animals had access to certified rodent diet (SCXK [SH] 2017-0012, Shanghai Pu Lu Teng Biological Technology) ad libitum. Water was available ad libitum. The nutritional composition and levels of contaminants of the diet and impurities and contaminants of the water were monitored. The health status of the animals was evaluated in accordance with accepted animal husbandry procedures and deemed suitable for experimental use.

Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed by Shanghai ChemPartner in male C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks old, 19–21 g; n = 27 mice) obtained from Shanghai Jihui Laboratory Animal (qualification no. SCXK (SH) 2022-0009, 20220009012123). Animals were housed with free access to food and water.

Compounds were administered intravenously (2 mg kg−1 or 5 ml kg−1, tail vein), orally (2 mg kg−1 or 10 ml kg−1, gavage) or intraperitoneally (10 mg kg−1 or 10 ml kg−1, injection). At defined time points, blood was collected under manual restraint either by facial-vein sampling or by terminal cardiac puncture. Approximately 95 μl of blood was drawn into K2EDTA tubes, kept on ice and centrifuged promptly (2,000g, 5 min, 4 °C) to isolate plasma within 15 min.

Alternatively, male C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks old, 19–21 g; n = 9 mice) obtained from Shanghai Jihui Laboratory Animal (qualification no. SCXK (SH) 2022-0009, 20220009020523) were administered compounds intraperitoneally (25, 50 or 75 mg kg−1, all 10 ml kg−1, injection). At defined time points, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and approximately 26 µl of blood per time point was collected into K2EDTA tubes through facial or cardiac puncture for terminal bleeding. Tubes were kept on ice and centrifuged promptly (2,000g, 5 min, 4 °C) to isolate plasma within 15 min.

Plasma samples were processed by protein precipitation. For undiluted plasma, 20 μl of sample was used. Alternatively, samples were prepared as tenfold dilutions (2 µl of sample diluted into 18 µl of blank plasma) or 20-fold dilutions (2 µl of sample diluted into 38 µl of blank plasma, shaken for 5 min, with 20 µl aliquoted for analysis). These samples were mixed with 200 μl of methanol containing 40 ng ml−1 diclofenac or propranolol as the internal standard (IS). The mixture was vortexed for 5 min and centrifuged (3,800g, 10 min). Then, 90 µl of supernatant was transferred to a fresh plate and 3 μl was injected for LC–MS/MS analysis.

Concentrations were calculated using a calibration curve using 0.2–1,000 ng ml−1 of the analyte in male C57 plasma.

PPB assays were performed by Shanghai ChemPartner. Plasma protein binding was determined using a 96-well equilibrium dialysis format with a sodium phosphate buffer system (0.05 M, pH 7.4). The buffer was prepared by combining monobasic and dibasic sodium phosphate solutions with sodium chloride, followed by dilution and pH adjustment to 7.4.

Stock solutions of test and reference compounds were diluted to generate two working solutions:

Solution A (0.5 mM): 10 µl of a 10 mM DMSO stock diluted with 190 µl of DMSO

Solution B (0.02 mM): 8 µl of solution A added to 192 µl of phosphate buffer (final DMSO 4%)

Working solutions were spiked into plasma by adding 20 µl of solution B to 380 µl of blank plasma in each well of a 96-well plate (final compound concentration: 1 µM, 0.2% DMSO). Dialysis chambers were preloaded with 100 µl of blank buffer on the receiver side. An equal volume of spiked plasma was added to the donor side. Chambers were sealed with a plastic lid and incubated on a shaker (60 rpm) for 5 h at 37 °C.

For T0 samples, immediately before incubation, 25-µl aliquots of spiked plasma were mixed 1:1 (v/v) with buffer and quenched with 200 µl of acetonitrile containing IS (warfarin or quinidine). For postdialysis samples (5 h), aliquots (25 µl) from both plasma (donor) and buffer (receiver) chambers were transferred to new plates, mixed 1:1 with the opposite matrix and quenched with 200 µl of acetonitrile containing IS. All samples were shaken at 600 rpm for 10 min and centrifuged at 5,594g for 15 min. Supernatants (50 µL) were transferred to new plates containing 50 µl of purified water and stored at −20 °C until LC–MS/MS quantification.

The fraction unbound was determined from the ratio of compound concentration in the buffer chamber to that in the plasma chamber at equilibrium, corrected for recovery using T0 samples.

The design and construction of the human UPS-focused sgRNA library used for ENL stability screens and the human CRBN DMS library were described previously36,49. The engineering of the fluorescent protein stability reporter of ENL for the FACS-based CRISPR–Cas9 and DMS screens and the CRBN point mutants for the validation of the DMS screen were performed as described previously34,49. The fluorescent protein stability reporter of GSPT1 was generated by inserting the GSPT1 coding sequence into pArtichoke plasmid (Addgene, 73320) by Gibson assembly. All the BRD4-based stability reporters were generated previously34. For splitHalo assays, two separate Gateway-compatible pRRL vectors were generated using cpHalo∆ sequence from Addgene 205703 (pRRL-SFFV-gw-EGFP-(GSG)9-cpHalo∆, where ‘gw' is the Gateway cassette) and the published Hpep6 sequence68 (pRRL-SFFV-Hpep6-GGGS-gw-EF1as-TagBFP), into which FBXO3 and BRD4 short (BRD4s) coding sequences were inserted by Gateway cloning.

KBM7 iCas9 cells were a gift from J. Zuber. Lenti-X 293T lentiviral packaging cells (Clontech), HEK293T cells and RPE1 cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Thermo Fisher) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher). MV4;11 cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 1% FCS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. KBM7 cells were cultured in IMDM supplemented with 1% FCS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. All cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and routinely tested for Mycoplasma contamination.

For lentiviral production, Lenti-X 293T cells were seeded in six-well plates or 10-cm dishes and transfected at approximately 80% confluency with 0.6/3.4 μg of target plasmid, 1.7/0.3 μg of psPAX2 (Addgene, 12260) and 0.85/0.15 μg of pMD2.G (Addgene, 12259) using PEI (PolySciences). Virus supernatant was collected after 60 h, filtered using a 0.45-μm filter and stored in aliquots for transduction.

The UPS-focused library packaged lentivirus-containing supernatant was used to transduce KBM7 ENL–TagBFP–P2A–mCherry or BRD4s–TagBFP–P2A–mCherry cells harboring iCas9 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.19 and 1,000-fold library representation for ENL and an MOI of 0.03 and 300-fold library representation for BRD4s using 8 μg ml−1 polybrene (Szabo Scandic, SACSC-134220). Library-transduced KBM7 cells were selected with 1 mg ml−1 G418 (Gibco) for 14 days and expanded; Cas9 expression was induced with doxycycline at 0.4 μg ml−1 (PanReac AppliChem). Then, 3 days after doxycycline induction, 50 million cells per condition were treated with DMSO, rac-dHTC1 (10 μM) or SR-1114 (10 μM) for 8 h in two biological replicates for ENL or with DMSO, dHTC2 (2 μM) or dHTC3 (2 μM) for 16 h in two biological replicates for BRD4s. Cells were washed with PBS, stained with APC anti-mouse Thy1.1 antibody (1:400; 202526, BioLegend) and Zombie near-infrared (NIR) fixable viability dye (1:1,000; BioLegend) in the presence of Human TruStain FcX Fc receptor blocking solution (1:400; 422302, BioLegend) for 10 min at 4 °C in the dark and fixed with 1 ml of BD CytoFix fixation buffer (BD Biosciences, 554655) for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. Cells were washed with and stored in FACS buffer (PBS with 5% FCS and 1 mM EDTA) at 4 °C overnight.

The next day, cells were strained through a 35-μm nylon mesh and sorted on a BD FACSAria Fusion (BD Biosciences) operated on BD FACSDiva software (version 8.0.2) using a 70-μm nozzle excluding aggregate, dead (Zombie NIR-positive), Cas9-negative (GFP-negative) and sgRNA library-negative (Thy1.1–APC-negative) cells. The remaining cells were sorted on the basis of their ENL–BFP or BRD4s–BFP and mCherry levels into ENL/BRD4shi (5–10% of cells), ENL/BRD4smid (25–50% of cells) and ENL/BRD4slow (5–10% of cells) fractions. Cells corresponding to at least 750-fold library representation were sorted per each sample replicate.

DNA libraries of sorted fractions for next-generation sequencing (NGS) were prepared as described previously121. In short, genomic DNA was extracted by cell lysis (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% SDS), proteinase K treatment (New England Biolabs) and DNAse-free RNAse digest (Thermo Fisher), followed by two rounds of phenol extraction and isopropanol precipitation.

Barcoded NGS libraries for each sorted fraction were prepared using a two-step PCR protocol using AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (Invitrogen). Barcodes for each sample were introduced in a first PCR, the product of which were purified using Mag-Bind TotalPure NGS beads (Omega Bio-tek) and amplified in a second PCR introducing the standard Illumina adaptors. The final Illumina libraries were bead-purified, pooled and sequenced on NovaSeq 6000 instrument (Illumina) following a 100-bp, paired-end recipe.

Screen analysis was performed as previously described121. In short, sequencing reads were trimmed using fastx-toolkit (version 0.0.14), aligned using Bowtie 2 (version 2.4.2) and quantified using featureCounts (version 2.0.1). The crispr-process-nf Nextflow workflow is available from GitHub (https://github.com/ZuberLab/crispr-process-nf/tree/566f6d46bbcc2a3f49f51bbc96b9820f408ec4a3). For statistical analysis, we used the crispr-mageck-nf Nextflow workflow, also available from GitHub (https://github.com/ZuberLab/crispr-mageck-nf/tree/c75a90f670698bfa78bfd8be786d6e5d6d4fc455). To calculate gene-level enrichment, the sorted populations (ENL/BRD4shigh or ENL/BRD4slow) were compared to the ENL/BRD4smid populations in MAGeCK (version 0.5.9)114 using median-normalized read counts.

A total of 18 million MV4;11 CRBN−/− ENL–TagBFP–P2A–mCherry cells were transduced with the CRBN DMS library virus supernatant at an MOI of 0.17, yielding a calculated library representation of 1,760 cells per variant. For the transduction, 1 million cells were seeded in a 24-well plate with 8 μg ml−1 polybrene (Szabo Scandic, SACSC-134220) and filled to 1 ml with the titrated amount of virus and culture medium. The plate was centrifuged at 760g for 45 min at 37 °C and then cells were pooled and expanded. Next, 3 days after transduction, library-transduced cells were selected with 1 μg ml−1 Blasticidin (Gibco, R21001) for 7 days and selected cells were expanded. A total of 50 million cells per condition were treated with rac-dHTC1 (1 μM) or SR-1114 (1 μM) for 8 h in three biological replicates. Cells were washed with PBS, stained with Zombie NIR fixable viability dye (1:1,000; BioLegend) for 10 min at 4 °C in the dark and fixed with 1 ml of BD CytoFix fixation buffer (BD Biosciences, 554655) for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. Cells were washed with and stored in FACS buffer (PBS with 5% FCS and 1 mM EDTA) at 4 °C overnight. Two sets of 50 million unsorted cells were also harvested as a control, directly washed and frozen.

The next day, cells were strained through a 35-μm nylon mesh and sorted on a BD FACSAria Fusion (BD Biosciences) operated on BD FACSDiva software (version 8.0.2) using a 70-μm nozzle excluding aggregate, dead (Zombie NIR-positive) and reporter-negative (BFP-negative and mCherry-negative) cells. The remaining cells were sorted on the basis of their ENL−1BFP and mCherry levels into an ENLhi fraction (30−135% of cells). Cells corresponding to at least 3,000-fold library representation were sorted per each sample replicate.

DNA libraries of sorted and unsorted cell pools for NGS were prepared as described previously49,121. In short, genomic DNA was extracted by cell lysis (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl and 0.1 % SDS), proteinase K treatment (New England Biolabs) and DNAse-free RNAse digest (Thermo Fisher), followed by two rounds of phenol extraction and isopropanol precipitation.

CRBN variant complementary DNA was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (Invitrogen) and primers CRBN_GA_fwd (AGGTGTCGTGACGTACGGGATCCCAGGACCATGGCCGGCGAAGGAG) and CRBN_GA_rev (GGGGGGGGGGCGGAATTAATTCCTACTACTTACAAGCAAAGTATTACTTTGTCTGGAC). The cycle number for specific amplification of the 1.4-kb CRBN target was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR reactions for each sample were pooled and purified using Mag-Bind TotalPure NGS beads (Omega Bio-tek). The library preparation from the amplified DNA was performed using the Tagment DNA TDE1 enzyme and IDT for Illumina unique dual indices (Illumina). Library concentrations were quantified with the Qubit 2.0 fluorometric quantitation system (Life Technologies) and the size distribution was assessed using the 2100 Bioanalyzer instrument (Agilent). For sequencing, samples were diluted and pooled into NGS libraries and sequenced on NovaSeq 6000 instrument (Illumina) following a 100-bp, paired-end recipe.

Raw sequencing reads were converted to fastq format with SAMtools (version 1.15.1) and BEDTools (version 2.30.0) using the bamtofastq function. Sequencing reads were trimmed using Trim Galore (version 0.6.6) using nextera and pair modes. Short reads were aligned to the CRBN cassette and SAM files were generated using mem algorithm from the bwa software package (version 0.7.17). The SAM file was converted to BAM using SAMtools and mutation calling was performed using the AnalyzeSaturationMutagenesis tool from GATK (version 4.1.8.1). Given our sequencing strategy, >98% of reads corresponded to WT sequences and were filtered out during this step. Next, relative frequencies of variants were calculated for each position and variants that were covered by <1 in 30,000 reads were excluded from further analysis. Read counts for each variant were then normalized to total read count of each sample and log2 fold changes of ENLhi over unsorted pools were calculated. To correct for differential drug potency, each variant was then normalized to the maximum log2 fold change. For drug comparisons, log2 fold changes of ENLhi over unsorted pools of each drug were subtracted. Heat maps were generated using the pheatmap (version 1.0.12) package in R (version 4.1.0) or with GraphPad Prism.

MV4;11 CRBN−/− ENL–TagBFP–P2A–mCherry or GSPT1–GFP–P2A–mCherry cells were transduced with lentivirus expressing WT or mutant CRBN in pRRL-EF1a-CRBN-IRES-BlastR plasmid to generate stable cell lines. For evaluation of reporter degradation on the different CRBN backgrounds, cells were treated with DMSO or rac-dHTC1, SR-1114 (both 1 μM, 6 h, ENL reporter) or CC-885 (1 μM, 5 h, GSPT1 reporter) before flow cytometry analysis on an LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences) operated on BD FACSDiva software (version 9.0).

KBM7 iCas9 expressing the reporter SFFV–BRD4(s)–mTagBFP–P2A–mCherry or its different truncations were generated previously34. To quantify the influence of genetic perturbation on compound-induced BRD4(s) reporter degradation, the stable cell line was transduced with lentiviral sgRNA (pLentiV2-U6-sgRNA-IT-PGK-iRFP720-P2A-Neo) to 30–50% transduction efficiency. Cas9 expression was induced by treating with doxycycline (0.4 μg ml−1) for 3 days, followed by a 16-h treatment with DMSO, dBET6 (10 nM), IBG3 (0.1 nM), dHTC2 (2 μM) or dHTC3 (2 μM). Cells were stained for sgRNA expression with an APC-conjugated anti-mouse Thy1.1 antibody (202526, BioLegend; 1:400) and human TruStain FcX receptor blocking solution (422302, BioLegend; 1:1,000) for 5 min at 4 °C in FACS buffer (PBS with 5% FBS and 1 mM EDTA). Cells were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer and analyzed on an LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences) operated on BD FACSDiva software (version 9.0).

Flow cytometry data analysis was performed in FlowJo version 10.10.0. mCherry and BFP median fluorescence intensity values were normalized by background subtraction of the respective values from reporter-negative KBM7 cells. BRD4 abundance was calculated as the ration of background-subtracted BFP to mCherry median fluorescence intensity and is displayed normalized to DMSO-treated cells.

RPE1 cells stably expressing SFFV–FBXO3–EGFP–cpHalo and SFFV–Hpep6–BRD4s–EF1as–TagBFP were seeded in 96-well plates. After attachment, cells were pretreated with carfilzomib (1 μM) and, when indicated, with DMSO, JQ1, GSK778 (iBET-BD1) or GSK046 (iBET-BD2) (all at 20 μM) for 1 h and then treated with DMSO, dBET6, epi-dHTC3 or dHTC3 at the concentrations indicated for each experiment in combination with 100 nM TAMRA-CA for 3 h. After treatment, cells were washed, trypsinized and resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS with 5% FBS and 1 mM EDTA) and analyzed on an LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences) with plate reader operated on BD FACSDiva software (version 9.0).

Flow cytometry data analysis was performed in FlowJo version 10.10.0. PE and GFP median fluorescence intensity values from GFP+BFP+ cells were normalized by background subtraction of the respective values from reporter-negative cells. SplitHalo signal was calculated as the ratio of background-subtracted PE to GFP median fluorescence intensity and is displayed normalized to DMSO-treated cells.

The Genome-wide pooled CRISPR/Cas9 KO screen was performed by the ChemoGenix platform (IRIC, Université de Montréal; https://chemogenix.iric.ca/) as previously described122. Briefly, a NALM6 clone bearing an integrated iCas9 expression cassette generated by lentiviruses made from pCW-Cas9 (Addgene, 50661) was transduced with the genome-wide KO EKO sgRNA library (278,754 different sgRNAs)122. After thawing the library from liquid N2 and letting it recover in 10% FBS RPMI for 1 day, KOs were induced for 7 days of culture with 2 µg ml−1 doxycycline. The pooled library was then split in different T-75 flasks (28 × 106 cells per flask; a representation of 100 cells per sgRNA) in 70 ml at 4 × 105 cells per ml. Cells were treated with dHTC2 (150 nM) or dHTC3 (400 nM), using 1,000× DMSO stock solution for 8 days with monitoring of growth every 2 days, diluting back to 4 × 105 cells per ml and adding more compound to maintain same final concentration whenever cells reached 8 × 105 cells per ml. Over that period, treated cells had 4.64 (dHTC2) or 1.39 (dHTC3) population doublings whereas DMSO-only treated negative controls had a 7.5 population doubling. Cells were collected, genomic DNA was extracted using the Gentra Puregene kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen) and sgRNA sequences were PCR-amplified as described122. sgRNA frequencies were obtained by NGS (Illumina NextSeq500). Reads were aligned using Bowtie 2.2.5 in the forward direction only (--norc option) with otherwise default parameters and total read counts per sgRNA were tabulated. Context-dependent chemogenomic interaction scores were calculated using a modified version of the RANKS algorithm122, which uses guides targeting similarly essential genes as controls to distinguish condition-specific chemogenomic interactions from nonspecific fitness and essentiality phenotypes. Raw read counts are available upon request from the ChemoGenix platform.

Structural coordinates were deposited to the PDB and are available under accession number 9GY3.

His6–CRBNmidi protein (Addgene, 215330) was expressed and purified as previously described41. CRBNmidi at 3.4 mg ml−1 in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl and 0.5 mM TCEP was mixed with a 4 M excess of dHTC1 (364 µM, 1.8% (v/v) DMSO final). The complex was subjected to cocrystallization using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method across several sparse matrix screens at 20 °C by mixing equal volumes of protein solution and reservoir solution. Crystal hits from Morpheus H10 (0.1 M buffer system 3, pH 8.5, 0.12 M alcohol and 30% precipitant mix 2) (Molecular Dimensions) were isolated directly from the drop and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen.

Diffraction data were collected at Diamond Light Source beamline I24 using the Eiger CdTe 9M detector at a wavelength of 0.6199 Å. The 2.2-Å dataset was processed using Dials123, indexed in the P31 space group and the structure was solved by molecular replacement in phenix.phaser124 using the coordinates of PDB 8RQA as a search model. Phenix.refine125 and Coot126 were used for refinement and model building.

The data discussed in this publication were deposited to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)127 under accession number GSE278582.

Total RNA was extracted from mouse-cell-depleted bone marrow cells from MV4;11 xenografts using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). RNA samples were run on a TapeStation (Agilent) to assure an RNA integrity score > 8 and quantified by Qbit (Thermo Fisher). The NEBNext poly(A) mRNA magnetic isolation module and NEBNext Ultra II RNA library prep kit (NEB BioLabs) were used to prepare RNA libraries. Sequencing was performed using the NextSeq500 (Illumina) as 37-bp paired-end sequencing with 20 million reads. Further analysis was performed on expressed genes (rlog expression < 3).

N-terminal His6-tagged hsDDB1ΔBPB (UniProt Q16531, amino acids 396–705 replaced with a GNGNSG linker) and FLAG-tagged hsCRBN (UniProt Q96SW2) were cloned into pAC8-derived vectors128. The N-terminal GST-tagged eGFP–hsCRBN was cloned into a pLIB vector, which was a gift from J.-M. Peters (Addgene, 80610)129. The pAC8 constructs were recombinantly expressed using the baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). To generate baculovirus from the pAC8-derived constructs, 1 μg of plasmids were cotransfected with linearized baculoviral DNA in Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells grown in ESF 921 medium (Expression Systems) at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells per ml. To generate baculovirus from the pLIB construct, 0.5 µg of the pLIB construct was transformed in DH10EMBacY cells130 and recombinant bacmid was isolated using the Invitrogen PureLink quick plasmid miniprep kit (Invitrogen, K210010). Sf9 cells were transfected at a density of of 1.0 × 106 cells per ml and viral titer was increased by three rounds of amplification. For protein expression, Trichoplusia ni High Five cells, grown in SF-4 Baculo Express ICM (BioConcept) to a density of 2 × 106 cells per ml, were coinfected with 1.5% (v/v) each of DDB1ΔBPB -expressing and CRBN-expressing baculoviruses. After 48 h of incubation, cells were collected (20 min, 3,300g).

For His6–hsDDB1ΔBPB/FLAG–hsCRBN-infected cells, the pellet was resuspended and sonicated in FLAG lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES–NaOH pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 1 mM TCEP) supplemented with protease inhibitors. The cell lysate was treated with Benzonase for 10 min and cleared by ultracentrifugation (60 min, 120,000g), the supernatant was incubated with FLAG antibody-coated beads (Genscript, L00432) and washed with wash buffer (50 mM HEPES–NaOH pH 8.0 and 200 mM NaCl). Bound proteins were eluted with 0.15 mg ml−1 1× FLAG (DYKDDDK) peptide and diluted to 50 mM NaCl with anion-exchange chromatography (IEX) buffer A (50 mM HEPES–NaOH pH 7.4 and 1 mM TCEP). Samples were added to Poros 50 HQ resin (Thermo Scientific) and eluted with a linear salt gradient from 50 mM to 1,000 mM. Peak fractions from IEX were concentrated using centrifugal concentrators (Amicon, 30-kDa molecular weight cutoff (MWCO)) and polished by SEC (HiLoad 16/600 Supderdex 200 pg, Cytiva) in CRBN SEC buffer (50 mM HEPES–NaOH pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM TCEP). Peak fractions were concentrated by centrifugation, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.

For His6–hsDDB1ΔBPB/GST–eGFP–hsCRBN cells, the pellet was resuspended and sonicated in GST lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 2 mM TCEP) supplemented with protease inhibitors. The cell lysate was cleared by ultracentrifugation and treated with Benzonase for 10 min, incubated with glutathione Sepharose 4B (Cytiva, GE17-0756-01) and washed with GST lysis buffer. Elution fractions including the target protein were pooled and concentrated using 30-kDa centrifugal concentrators and cleaved with tobacco etch virus protease at 4 °C overnight. The sample was diluted to 50 mM NaCl and cleared through IEX, followed by SEC using eGFP–CRBN SEC buffer (25 mM HEPES–NaOH pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl and 2 mM TCEP).

The C-terminal His6-tagged ENL YEATS domain (amino acids 1–148; UniProt Q03111) and C-terminal Strep-Avi-tagged ENL YEATS domain were cloned into a pNIC-Bio2 (SGC Oxford) vector and expressed in a LOBSTR Escherichia coli expression strain (Kerafast, EC1002). After transformation, 2-L cultures in Terrific Broth medium were grown at 37 °C to an OD600 of ~0.6 and induced with 0.35 mM IPTG. Temperature was decreased to 18 °C, proteins were expressed overnight and cultures were harvested by centrifugation (20 min, 3,300g). Cell pellets were resuspended in His lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES–NaOH pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 5% (v/v) glycerol and 1 mM TCEP) or Strep lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES–NaOH pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol and 2 mM TCEP) supplemented with protease inhibitors and lysed using sonication. After clearance by ultracentrifugation (60 min, 120,000g), the supernatant was treated with Benzonase for 10 min and incubated with high-affinity Ni-charged resin (Genscript, L00223) or Strep-Tactin XT 4Flow high-capacity resin (IBA Life Sciences, 2-5030-002). Bound proteins were eluted with increasing imidazole concentrations (150–750 mM) or 50 mM biotin. His6-tagged protein elution fractions were concentrated using a centrifugal concentrator (10-kDa MWCO) and polished by SEC (Superdex 75 Increase 10/300 GL, Cytiva) in ENL SEC buffer (30 mM HEPES–NaOH pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl and 3 mM TCEP). Peak fractions were concentrated by centrifugation, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Strep-tagged protein elution fractions were concentrated using a centrifugal concentrator (10-kDa MWCO) and biotinylated overnight in 4 °C with BirA biotin ligase. Biotinylated ENL YEATS domain was further polished by SEC using ENL SEC buffer.

DDB1∆BPB•CRBN, dHTC1 and ENL YEATS were mixed and incubated on ice for 1 h at a final concentration of 1.4, 14 and 2.8 µM (dataset 1) and 1.6, 16 and 3.2 µM (dataset 2), respectively, keeping DMSO concentrations below 2% (v/v). Grids (Quantifoil UltrAuFoil R 0.6/1) were glow-discharged (20 mA, 120 s, 39 Pa) and vitrified in a Leica EM-GP operated at 10 °C and 90% relative humidity. Grids were preincubated with 4 µl of 10 µM CRBN agnostic IKZF1-Q146A;G151N (amino acids 140–196) for 1 min and then blotted from behind for 4 s with NCI Micro Whatman no. 1 filter paper. Immediately, 4 µl of the sample were applied to the grids before blotting for 4 s and plunging into liquid ethane, kept at −181 °C. Datasets were collected using Smart EPU (version 3.7) on a Thermo Scientific Titan Krios equipped with a Thermo Fisher Scientific Selectris energy filter (10-eV slit width) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Falcon 4 direct electron detector. Videos (49 frames per video, 2.87-s exposure time) were acquired at 300 kV at a nominal magnification of ×165,000 in counting mode with a pixel size of 0.736 Å per pixel. One video was recorded per hole with aberration-free image shift (as implemented in EPU). A total of 9,856 videos for dataset 1 and 13,027 videos for dataset 2 were recorded with defocus varying from −0.8 to −2.0 µm and a total exposure rate of 50.22 e− per A2.

cryoSPARC (version 4.5.3)131 was used for all processing steps. All resolutions given are based on the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) = 0.143 threshold criterion132. For dataset 1, 9,856 videos were corrected for beam-induced motion and contrast transfer function (CTF) was estimated on the fly in cryoSPARC live. Low-quality videos were rejected and 1,267,417 particles were extracted (1.31 Å per pixel) from the 6,558 remaining micrographs after TOPAZ (version 0.2.5a)133 particle picking. The particles were cleaned up in three rounds of heterogeneous refinement. Preferred orientation became apparent at this step. Thus, the remaining 994,856 particles were further classified using heterogeneous refinement, which revealed a small number of classes (95,520 particles) representing a more balanced range of views. The selected 95,520 particles were reextracted at 0.92 Å per pixel. For dataset 2, 13,027 videos were corrected from beam-induced motion and CTF was estimated on the fly in cryoSPARC live. Low-quality videos were rejected and the remaining 11,541 micrographs were split into two groups, resulting in 5,173,911 particles extracted (1.31 Å per pixel) after TOPAZ (version 0.2.5a)133 particle picking. The particles were cleaned up in two rounds of heterogeneous refinement. Similarly to dataset 1, the resulting 1,536,327 particles were further classified using heterogeneous refinement, which again revealed a small number of classes (89,792 particles) with more balanced views. The selected 89,792 particles were reextracted at 0.92 Å per pixel and combined with the particles from dataset 1. The pooled particles were used in a final homogeneous refinement, yielding a consensus reconstruction at global resolution of 2.6 Å. Local refinement with a soft mask encompassing CRBN and ENL YEATS yielded a final reconstruction at 2.9 Å (EMD-47174), which was followed by postprocessing using deepEMhancer to improve the density for ENL YEATS were used for model building. CRBN (PDB 8TNQ) and ENL YEATS (PDB 6HPY) were fit into the density in UCSF ChimeraX (version 1.6.1)134,135 and relaxed using ISOLDE (version 1.6.0)136 and Rosetta (version 3.13)137. The relaxed model was manually adjusted in Coot (version 0.9.8.0)126 and prepared for refinement with phenix.ready_set (version 1.19.2-4158)138, followed by refinement using reference restraints in phenix.real_space_refine (version 1.19.2-4158)139 against the unsharpened maps. For figures, DDB1ΔBPB (from PDB 8TNQ) was placed on the basis of a superposition of CRBN. The final model (9DUR) and map (EMD-47174) were deposited to the PDB and EM Data Bank, respectively. Data collection parameters and refinement statistics are available in Supplementary Table 9. To compare the model with other reported CRBN structures, every reported closed conformation CRBN structure in complex with a molecular glue degrader or a PROTAC was superimposed (PDB 4TZ4, 5FQD, 5HXB, 5V3O, 6BN7, 6BN8, 6BN9, 6BOY, 6H0G, 6UML, 6XK9, 7LPS, 8D7U, 8D7V, 8D7W, 8D7Z, 8D80, 8D81, 8DEY, 8G66, 8OIZ, 8OJH, 8TNP, 8TNQ, 8TNR, 8TZX, 8U15, 8U16 and 8U17) with the C-terminal domain (amino acids 318–442) of the CRBN in the model13,14,15,17,53,74,78,140,141,142,143,144,145,146. For comparison with a non-ligand-bound ENL structure, we superimposed PDB 6HQ0 with the ENL YEATS domain in the model115. Backbone r.m.s.d. values were calculated in UCSF ChimeraX (version 1.9)134,135. Structural biology applications used in this project were compiled and configured by SBGrid147.

Interface comparison was made with Rosetta (version 3.13) by reordering the jump number of fold tree such that the CRBN and ENL YEATS interface was compared and then the following command was used to obtain buried interface solvent-accessible surface area and shape complementarity score52: sasa_and_sc_calc_scripts.sh.

A total of 1 × 107 cells per immunoprecipitation were collected and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP, 0.1% NP-40, 10 U of turbonuclease per 200 µl of buffer and 1× cOmplete protease inhibitor tablet per 5 ml of buffer) and sonicated on ice for five rounds of 2 s followed by 10-s pauses at 25% amplitude. After centrifugation clarification, the following steps were performed on an opentrons OT2 liquid handler. Cell lysate, 10 µg of FLAG–CRBN–DDB1ΔB, 1 µM of MLN4924 and CSN5i-3 (neddylation trap)148 and 1 µM of selected degraders or DMSO vehicle control were transferred to PCR plate and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Then, 3 µl of prewashed and resuspended anti-FLAG magnetic bead 25% slurry (Pierce) were added to the lysates, followed by a second incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with wash buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 2 mM TCEP, 0.1% NP-40 and 1× cOmplete protease inhibitor tablet per 5 ml of buffer) containing the required compounds, followed by three additional nondetergent (50 mM Tris pH 8, 2 mM TCEP and 1× cOmplete protease inhibitor tablet per 5 ml of buffer) washes containing the required compounds. After the final wash step, samples were eluted using 0.1 M glycine-HCl pH 2.7. Tris (1 M, pH 8.5) was added to elution to reach a pH of 8. Samples were then reduced with 10 mM TCEP for 30 min at room temperature, followed by alkylation with 15 mM iodoacetamide for 45 min at room temperature in the dark. Alkylation was quenched by the addition of 10 mM DTT. The resuspended protein samples were digested with 2 μg of LysC and 1 μg of trypsin overnight at 37 °C. Sample digests were acidified with formic acid to a pH of 2–3 before desalting using C18 solid-phase extraction plates (SOLA, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Desalted peptides were dried in a vacuum-centrifuged and reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid for LC–MS analysis.

Data were collected using a TimsTOF Ultra2 (Bruker Daltonics) coupled to a nanoElute2 LC pump (Bruker Daltonics) through a CaptiveSpray nanoelectrospray source. Peptides were separated on a reversed-phase C18 column (25 cm × 75 μm inner diameter, 1.6 μm; IonOpticks) containing an integrated CaptiveSpray emitter. Peptides were separated using a 30-min gradient of 2–30% buffer B (acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid) with a flow rate of 250 nl min−1 and column temperature maintained at 50 °C.

The thermal ionization MS elution voltages were calibrated linearly with three points (Agilent ESI-L tuning mix ions; 622, 922 and 1,222 m/z) to determine the reduced ion mobility coefficients (1/K0). To perform data-independent acquisition parallel accumulation–serial fragmentation (diaPASEF), we used py_diAID149, a Python package, to assess the precursor distribution in the m/z ion mobility plane to generate a diaPASEF acquisition scheme with variable window isolation widths aligned to the precursor density in m/z. Data were acquired using 20 cycles with three mobility window scans each (creating 60 windows) covering the diagonal scan line for doubly and triply charged precursors, with singly charged precursors able to be excluded by their position in the m/z ion mobility plane. These precursor isolation windows were defined between 350 and 1,250 m/z, with 1/K0 of 0.6–1.45 V s cm−2.

The diaPASEF raw file processing and control of peptide-level and protein-level false discovery rates (FDRs), assembly of proteins from peptides and protein quantification from peptides were performed using library-free analysis in DIA-NN (version 1.8)150 searched against a Swiss-Prot human database (January 2021). Database search criteria largely followed the default settings for directDIA including: tryptic with two missed cleavages, carbamidomethylation of cysteine and oxidation of methionine and a precursor Q-value (FDR) cutoff of 0.01. The precursor quantification strategy was set to robust LC (high accuracy) with retention-time-dependent cross-run normalization. Resulting data were filtered to only include proteins that had a minimum of three counts in at least four replicates of each independent comparison of treatment sample to the DMSO control. Protein abundances were globally normalized using in-house scripts in the R framework (R Development Core Team, 2014). Proteins with missing values were imputed by random selection from a Gaussian distribution either with a mean of the nonmissing values for that treatment group or with a mean equal to the median of the background (in cases where all values for a treatment group were missing42). Protein abundances were scaled and significant changes comparing the relative protein abundance of these treatments to DMSO control comparisons were assessed by moderated t-test as implemented in the limma package within the R framework151.

Mutations were induced with primers on a lentiviral compatible construct expressing ENL–BFP.

In a 1:1 ratio, each mutated plasmid was Gibson-assembled into the other half of the pRRL-SFFV-ENL-GGGS-3×V5-BFP backbone. Lentivirus of each plasmid (pRRL-SFFV-ENL-GGGS-3×V5-BFP, pRRL-SFFV-ENLR16A-GGGS-3×V5-BFP, pRRL-SFFV-ENLD31A-GGGS-3×V5-BFP, pRRL-SFFV-ENLM33A-GGGS-3×V5-BFP, pRRL-SFFV-ENLQ41A-GGGS-3×V5-BFP, pRRL-SFFV-ENLK72A-GGGS-3×V5-BFP, pRRL-SFFV-ENLE74A-GGGS-3×V5-BFP and pRRL-SFFV-ENLR96A-GGGS-3×V5-BFP) was prepared as described above and transduced into MV4;11 cells. Cells were selected for BFP expression. BFP signal was measured by flow cytometry after a 24-h treatment with (S)-dHTC1, (R)-dHTC1 or SR-1114 and normalized to DMSO (n = 3) at the doses indicated.

A Cornell physicist has calculated that the universe may be nearing the halfway point of a total lifespan of about 33 billion years. Using newly released data from major dark energy observatories, he concludes that the cosmos will continue expanding for roughly another 11 billion years before reaching its largest size. After that, it would begin to shrink, eventually collapsing back into a single point, much like a stretched rubber band snapping back.

Henry Tye, the Horace White Professor of Physics Emeritus in the College of Arts and Sciences, arrived at this conclusion by updating a long standing model built around the "cosmological constant." This concept was first introduced more than a century ago by Albert Einstein and has been central to modern predictions about how the universe will evolve.

"For the last 20 years, people believed that the cosmological constant is positive, and the universe will expand forever," Tye said. "The new data seem to indicate that the cosmological constant is negative, and that the universe will end in a big crunch."

Tye is the corresponding author of "The Lifespan of our Universe," published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics.

Big Crunch Versus Endless Expansion

The universe is currently 13.8 billion years old and still expanding. Standard cosmology outlines two straightforward possibilities. If the cosmological constant is positive, expansion continues indefinitely. If it is negative, the universe would eventually stop growing, reach a maximum size, and then reverse direction, contracting until everything collapses to zero.

Tye's updated model supports the second outcome.

"This big crunch defines the end of the universe," Tye wrote. Based on his calculations, that collapse would occur in about 20 billion years.

Dark Energy Data From DES and DESI

Key evidence comes from new findings released this year by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) in Chile and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in Arizona. Tye noted that results from these two observatories, located in opposite hemispheres, closely agree with each other.

Both projects aim to better understand dark energy, which makes up about 68% of the mass and energy in the universe. Their goal is to test whether dark energy is simply a constant property of space itself. Instead, the data suggest the situation may be more complex. The universe does not appear to be governed solely by a pure cosmological constant. Something additional may be influencing how dark energy behaves.

To account for this, Tye and his collaborators proposed a hypothetical particle with extremely low mass. Early in cosmic history, this particle would have acted like a cosmological constant, but over time its effects would have changed. This adjustment fits the latest observations and pushes the underlying cosmological constant into negative territory.

"People have said before that if the cosmological constant is negative, then the universe will collapse eventually. That's not new," Tye said. "However, here the model tells you when the universe collapses and how it collapses."

Ongoing Observations and Future Tests

More data are on the way. Hundreds of researchers are studying millions of galaxies and measuring the distances between them to refine estimates of dark energy. DESI will continue collecting observations for another year. Additional projects are already contributing or preparing to begin, including the Zwicky Transient Facility in San Diego; the European Euclid space telescope; NASA's recently launched SPHEREx mission; and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (named after Vera Rubin, M.S. '51).

Understanding the Beginning and the End

Tye says it is encouraging that scientists can attempt to calculate the total lifespan of the universe in measurable terms. Identifying both the starting point and the eventual conclusion helps cosmologists better understand the full story of cosmic history.

"For any life, you want to know how life begins and how life ends -- the end points," he said. "For our universe, it's also interesting to know, does it have a beginning? In the 1960s, we learned that it has a beginning. Then the next question is, 'Does it have an end?' For many years, many people thought it would just go on forever. It's good to know that, if the data holds up, the universe will have an end."

Tye's co-authors are his former Hong Kong University of Science and Technology doctoral students Hoang Nhan Luu and Yu-Cheng Qiu.

Scientists at the University of California San Diego have identified the enzyme responsible for chromothripsis, a dramatic genetic event in which a chromosome breaks into many fragments and is stitched back together in the wrong order. This chaotic reshuffling allows cancer cells to evolve quickly and develop resistance to treatment. Although chromothripsis was first recognized more than ten years ago as a major force in cancer progression, researchers had not known what actually set it in motion. The new findings, published in Science, uncover the cause and point to potential new strategies for treating some of the most aggressive cancers.

Cancer cells use several tactics to survive therapy, but chromothripsis stands out because of its sheer scale. Rather than building up mutations gradually over time, this process can create dozens or even hundreds of genetic alterations in a single catastrophic episode. The result is a rapid burst of evolution that can make tumors harder to control.

Chromothripsis is also surprisingly common. Studies suggest that about one in four cancers shows signs of this type of chromosome damage, and in some cancers the rate is even higher. Nearly all osteosarcomas, an aggressive bone cancer, display evidence of chromothripsis, and many brain cancers show especially elevated levels.

"This discovery finally reveals the molecular 'spark' that ignites one of the most aggressive forms of genome rearrangement in cancer," said senior author Don Cleveland, Ph.D., professor of cellular and molecular medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine and member of UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center. "By finding what breaks the chromosome in the first place, we now have a new and actionable point of intervention for slowing cancer evolution."

How N4BP2 Breaks DNA Inside Micronuclei

Chromothripsis begins when errors during cell division trap individual chromosomes inside small, fragile compartments known as micronuclei. When a micronucleus ruptures, the chromosome inside is left exposed. At that point, it becomes vulnerable to nucleases, enzymes that can cut DNA strands.

Until now, researchers did not know which nuclease was responsible for triggering this destructive chain reaction, making it impossible to design therapies aimed at stopping it.

To pinpoint the culprit, the team used an imaging based screening approach to systematically examine all known and predicted human nucleases. They monitored how each enzyme behaved in living cancer cells. One enzyme, N4BP2, stood out. It was uniquely able to enter micronuclei and fragment the DNA inside.

The researchers then tested whether N4BP2 directly causes chromothripsis. When they removed the enzyme from brain cancer cells, chromosome shattering dropped dramatically. In contrast, when they forced N4BP2 into the cell nucleus, intact chromosomes broke apart, even in otherwise healthy cells.

"These experiments showed us that N4BP2 isn't just correlated with chromothripsis. It is sufficient to cause it," said first author Ksenia Krupina, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow at UC San Diego. "This is the first direct molecular explanation for how catastrophic chromosome fragmentation begins."

Link to Aggressive Tumors and Extrachromosomal DNA

The team also examined more than 10,000 cancer genomes spanning multiple tumor types. Cancers with higher levels of N4BP2 activity showed significantly more chromothripsis and large scale structural rearrangements. These tumors also had increased amounts of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA), circular DNA fragments that often carry cancer promoting genes and are closely associated with aggressive growth and resistance to therapy.

Tumors rich in ecDNA are among the most difficult to treat. As a result, ecDNA has drawn major scientific interest and has been named one of the Cancer Grand Challenges by the National Cancer Institute and Cancer Research UK. The new findings suggest that ecDNA is not a separate phenomenon but rather a downstream consequence of chromothripsis. By placing N4BP2 at the very start of this process, the study highlights a key entry point for understanding and potentially controlling some of the most unstable and dangerous forms of cancer genome instability.

"Understanding what triggers chromothripsis gives us a new way to think about stopping it," said Cleveland. "By targeting N4BP2 or the pathways it activates, we may be able to limit the genomic chaos that allows tumors to adapt, recur and become drug-resistant."

Pseudouridine (Ψ) is an abundant modification in small RNA catalyzed by multiple pseudouridine synthases (PUSs). However, the substrate specificity of human PUSs remains elusive. Here, we adopted PRAISE, a quantitative Ψ detection method, to profile pseudouridylation in small RNA, including cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs, snRNA, and snoRNA. We found that snoRNA pseudouridylation is mediated not only by RNA-guided DKC1, but also by the stand-alone enzyme PUS7 at a specific site. Interestingly, several PUS enzymes, including PUS1, RPUSD1, and PUS7, which install nearby Ψ sites within tRNA anticodon stem-loop, can influence pseudouridylation catalyzed by other PUSs, revealing an unrecognized interplay during Ψ formation. For the three RluA family enzymes, RPUSD1 catalyzes the canonical Ψ30 in tRNA-Ile and Ψ72 in tRNA-Arg isoacceptors. RPUSD2 pseudouridylates Ψ31 of mt-tRNALeu(CUN), Ψ32 of mt-tRNAPro and mt-tRNACys, whereas RPUSD3 lacks tRNA activity. Together, our quantitative Ψ profiling characterized PUS tRNA substrates and revealed unexpected PUS interplay.

Expedia is responding to the AI era by making sure it's testing new ways to reach travelers — and also using it aggressively inside its own business.

In its newly filed 10-K annual report, the Seattle-based company added a reference to “generative and agentic AI” under its competitive threats, warning that the technology could intensify competition and shift travelers toward new AI-driven platforms where Expedia “may lack a significant presence.”

That's a sharper framing than just a year ago. The new filing also explicitly names “companies offering AI agents” as a competitor category.

The updated language reflects a broader potential shift in how consumers find information and book travel. Instead of typing search queries into Google or browsing travel sites directly, some travelers may increasingly rely on AI assistants to research, compare, and even book trips automatically.

On Expedia's fourth-quarter earnings call last week, CEO Ariane Gorin said the company is “working with all the major platforms” to ensure its brands appear prominently in generative AI searches and function effectively with agentic browsers.

“We're experimenting aggressively,” she said, noting that while AI-driven volume remains small today, each integration provides data and insight into evolving traveler behavior.

At the same time, Expedia is building more AI capabilities directly into its products. The company is rolling out conversational tools and natural-language features, including an AI agent within Hotels.com, as well as AI-powered filters and property Q&A tools.

Gorin said she'd share more later this year about how Expedia can use natural language and AI “to allow people to go from the trip planning all the way into the booking.”

Expedia in October released its own app for conversations within ChatGPT.

Inside Expedia's own operations, Gorin said AI tools are already delivering “tangible benefits.” Product and engineering teams are using AI to build features faster. Supply teams are using AI to speed up inventory onboarding. And customer service teams are using AI to resolve traveler issues more quickly as Expedia reported record self-service levels.

Gorin said “we're deploying AI internally to give our teams superpowers and make our offerings to travelers and partners even more competitive.”

Meanwhile, Expedia is betting that direct relationships with travelers will remain a competitive advantage. Two-thirds of bookings already come from travelers who begin directly with Expedia's brands, and those direct bookings are growing faster than indirect channels, Gorin said.

In the annual filing, Expedia also flagged a new concern: “agentic booking capabilities that may lack strong consent controls” could significantly increase fraud risks — suggesting automated booking systems could create new consent and authorization challenges.

The filing also shows that Expedia's overall headcount dropped by 3% to 16,000 people as of Dec. 31 last year. About half of its workforce is in tech-related roles. Expedia recently laid off 162 workers in Washington state as part of its latest workforce reduction.

On the earnings call, CFO Scott Schenkel said Expedia took action in January to “simplify” its product and technology organizations — and said the company will use “much of the savings to strategically rehire in key areas like AI and machine learning.”

Expedia reported fourth-quarter gross bookings and revenue up 11% year over year.



University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines.

Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

One person's recreational drug trip might be another's mental health boost. Research out today finds that dimethyltryptamine, better known as DMT, could be effective at treating people's depression.

Researchers in the UK conducted a small, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of people with major depression. Compared to controls, people on DMT experienced a rapid drop in their depressive symptoms, one that lasted at least 12 weeks later. Though larger studies are warranted, the findings suggest that DMT could very well become the next psychedelic drug rechristened as psychiatric medicine.

“A single dose of DMT with psychotherapeutic support produced a rapid, significant reduction in depressive symptoms, sustained up to 3 months,” the researchers wrote in their paper, published Monday in Nature Medicine.

Psychedelic drugs have garnered lots of scientific attention as of late for their potential to treat various mental health conditions, usually in conjunction with other forms of therapy. Drugs like LSD, MDMA, and psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, have shown promise in small trials for anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Other studies have suggested these drugs can rewire the brains of people with these conditions in positive ways.

LSD Could Offer a Next-Gen Treatment for Anxiety

Compared to these drugs, DMT has received less attention. Yet the researchers behind the study argue that it may have its unique advantages, namely time. Typically, the drug's most profound effects fade away much quicker than other psychedelics, with a half life of around five minutes. (That said, DMT is also one of the ingredients in the psychedelic brew ayahuasca, which has a much longer duration). This limited duration could then allow for shorter, more convenient, and likely less costly sessions of therapy to be paired with it—provided the drug can work as hoped.

The researchers' new Phase IIa trial involved 34 volunteers diagnosed with moderate to severe depression. Half of the volunteers were randomized to receive an infusion of DMT plus therapy right at the start of the study, followed by a second dose two weeks later; the other half received a placebo infusion, followed by an actual dose of DMT two weeks later. This design ensured that all the participants could obtain a potentially beneficial treatment, while still enabling researchers to have a placebo control group for comparison—at least for the immediate, short term effects of the drug.

On average, people who took DMT at the study's start reported significantly fewer depression symptoms compared to the delayed treatment group. And once the second group took DMT, they also reported a reduction of their depression. Though two doses of DMT didn't seem to be more effective than one dose, both groups experienced a similar level of improvement that was sustained for at least three months, and even up to six months for some participants. By the three month mark, 47% of participants (across both groups) had improved enough to be considered in remission.

DMT also appeared to be safe and well-tolerated. No serious adverse events were reported, and the most common events linked to the drug were infusion site pain, nausea, and transient anxiety.

These results are still based on a very small sample size, so it's far from definitive proof that DMT should become widely used to treat depression. At the very least, though, the results do justify more research.

“Longer and larger trials, including comparisons with existing treatments, are needed to further evaluate the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of DMT in the treatment of depression,” the study authors wrote.

Psilocybin Therapy Changes Brain Wiring in Depressed People, Study Finds

Some research teams and companies are already moving ahead with larger trials of DMT for depression and other mental health conditions, including versions of DMT that last relatively longer in the body. But there's still a long way to go before psychedelics like DMT could become a routine psychiatric treatment.

In 2024, the FDA rejected Lykos Therapeutics' MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD, stating that further positive Phase III data was needed to secure approval (the company rebranded as Resilient Therapeutics last year, though the current status of its application is unclear). And though the Trump administration has encouraged further psychedelic research at times, senior officials last week rejected the FDA's plan to speed along the regulatory review process of Compass Pathways' psilocybin-based treatment for severe depression.

The era of psychedelic medicine may yet come, but not without some bumps along the way.

Dell still wants to recreate the MacBook. That became clear with last year's boneheaded move, in which it changed the name of its entire PC portfolio, calling laptops “Dell Pro” or “Dell Pro Max.” Now, it's brought back the age-old XPS branding with a sleek new logo, but it still seems to be trying to establish itself as the professional's first choice for PCs. Have its efforts finally paid off?

Well, almost. This new XPS 14 is more MacBook Air-like than ever before, from increased performance to limited ports. As you can expect, it's packing Intel's Panther Lake chips with the extra GPU cores. That means it's a great laptop for some use cases—especially for moderate graphics tasks. But its off-putting keyboard is also sure to frustrate fingers.

Dell XPS 14 (2026)

The Dell XPS is a great work laptop especially for moderate graphics tasks. You'll just have to overcome its offputting keyboard.

Pros

Cons

The latest version of the company's “extreme performance systems” has the kind of battery life we've been hoping for since they started making laptops this small. Dell sent Gizmodo two versions of its laptop for review, though the cheaper $1,700 model mostly serves as an example of why you want a higher-end chip. The midrange Intel Core Ultra X7 358H can't hit the same CPU benchmarks as Apple's leading MacBook Pro M5, but it wins out in iGPU performance, which makes it excellent for light graphics tasks. Want to game on this thing? It's possible, so long as you can accept some tradeoffs.

We're inching towards Apple in terms of not only performance but also locked-down hardware and price. This laptop still has soldered RAM, so don't expect to upgrade anytime soon (not that you would with RAM prices being so high). The XPS 14 with an X7 358H will cost $2,200. That's competitive with several 14-inch laptops featuring a discrete GPU, such as last year's Razer Blade 14 and Apple's M5 MacBook Pro, which have similar memory specs.

The higher-end XPS 14 with 32GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and an OLED screen is closer to the laptop you actually want. But whether it's actually the best laptop for you will depend on the size of your wallet and your tolerance for odd keyboards.

Dell's penchant for oddball XPS design finally combines looks and functionality. The company excised the moronic light-up function row on the 2024 XPS 14 models, which had made the ESC, brightness, and volume keys impossible to find when the laptop was turned off. That previous design was an accessibility nightmare for people with low vision. Now—thankfully—the function row is a typical set of keys.

Dell also added two thin lines along the former seamless trackpad to help you identify the area you can touch. I never ran out of runway during day-to-day use. On the other hand, Dell has stuck with the seamless keyboard on these latest XPS models. That means every key sits nearly flush to the one next to it. There's a subtle divot in the center of each key to offer more of a tactile feel, but it's not enough to stop me from accidentally hitting multiple keys at once, and it's certainly been garbling my words even as I “writye thjis trevbiew.”

With enough practice, I may eventually get the feel for this keyboard. Maybe it's worth the effort for the sake of such a cool-looking device. The same cannot necessarily be said for the trackpad, however, which is so big that it overlaps with the area where I naturally place my wrists. This has led to all kinds of palm-rejection issues, unintended clicks, and excessive slams of CTRL+Z.

Despite all that, the XPS 14 does make me feel like a smooth operator. The low-profile keys feel snappier than those of a typical small laptop. The haptic trackpad (which uses a motor to simulate the feel of a physical click) is glassy with just enough texture that your finger doesn't feel like a skater on an ice rink. The fact that the keys are so close together means I didn't see nearly as much dust buildup between them. And that's good news for messy eaters like me. Less distance between keys means there's less chance a crumb might slip between the cracks.

The 2026 XPS 14 is a square laptop with a thin base, only .58 inches thick. It's also light, with the OLED model weighing in at just 3 pounds and the LCD at 3.05. A MacBook Air weighs 2.7 pounds and is .44 inches thick. That makes sense, since the XPS uses a relatively quiet fan setup compared to the Air's passive cooling.

Unfortunately, as is the case with the Air, the XPS' slim frame comes at the cost of inputs and outputs. This device sports three Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports, and that's it. To make my preferred multiscreen setup work, I had to drag a dock around during testing. If you've ever used a MacBook Air as a daily driver, you'll know that limited port selection also gets annoying if you want to charge your laptop and use other docks or dongles at the same time. There's also the limitation of Thunderbolt 4 instead of Thunderbolt 5 and its higher transfer speeds, which is a casualty of the Intel Core Ultra Series 3's design.

The XPS tandem OLED screen may seem squat when you sit in front of it, though it's still one of the prettier versions of this design we've seen on laptops. The bezels to either side of the display are relatively minuscule, as is the 1080p webcam cutout on top.

Tandem OLED devices stack multiple layers of diodes, increasing brightness and efficiency. This one clocks in at 2,880 x 1,800 pixels. It's a touch panel with a 20-120Hz refresh rate and a stated brightness of 400 nits. In standard use, that's luminous enough for shade or direct sunlight.

The OLED version offers crisp visuals, and deep blacks enable great contrast. If you opt for the cheaper model with IPS LCD, you're stuck with a 1200p monitor with a slightly higher brightness setting and not much else to write home about.

This device can work as your main platform for a comfortable streaming session, so long as you don't mind cuddling close with your partner around a 14-inch screen. Despite its down-firing speakers, this laptop delivers an impressive soundstage. It's using a 10W quad-speaker design with two 3W speakers and two tweeters. The device practically reverberates with bass levels you normally can't get from a laptop of this size.

I also have to give props to the webcam. My picture quality in a video call was far clearer than that of any of my colleagues at Gizmodo during our weekly meeting. Is that a reason to be smug? If somebody bragged to me with a smug face that they had a clearer picture in a Zoom meeting, I'd have to resist the urge to slap them. Still, it's worth noting.

I had just finished reviewing the $2,400 Asus Zenbook Duo with its top-end Intel X9 388H, the chipmaker's flagship 16-core CPU, delivering strong graphics performance in a relatively compact design. Dell told Gizmodo it would offer a variant of the XPS 14 and XPS 16 with an X9 chip in the future, but couldn't provide an exact timeline.

Instead, you have two variants of Dell's latest 14-inch model to start. As I mentioned before, the Intel Core Ultra 7 and X7 variants will have entirely different performance characteristics, meaning one will be better suited to demanding work tasks while the cheaper version can suffice for browsing, word processing, and other general work use cases.

The Intel Core Ultra X9 stacks up well against the M5 in practically all our productivity, graphics, and gaming benchmarks. The X7, on the other hand, is more of a mixed bag. In terms of CPU performance on single-core tasks, the XPS 14 scored just 100 points shy of the X9 on Geekbench 6's benchmark. It's about 1,000 points shy of that chip on multicore tasks as well. It still manages to beat the Intel Core Ultra 7 288V, one of the leading last-gen Intel chips powering the Acer Predator Triton 14 AI.

In a contest of CPU performance between Mac and Dell, the M-series has the upper hand. On Geekbench, the midrange Intel CPU is still close to 800 points behind the M4 MacBook Air in single-core and 1,600 points behind in multicore. Though the X7 358H can beat an M4 on Cinebench 2024—measuring the CPUs' rendering capabilities—in multicore settings, it's still 300 points shy of Apple's latest M5, which launched late last year. It took more than six minutes to transcode a 4K video to 1080p in Handbrake; the MacBook Air took just over two minutes.

Thankfully, the contest measures pure CPU performance. The “X7” and “X9” variants of Intel's chips have a trick up their sleeve, thanks to the 12 extra Xe3 GPU cores. In terms of more intensive productivity tasks, the XPS 14 will render a scene of a BMW in Blender just a few seconds slower than the Zenbook Duo when running on the Arc B390 GPU. The iGPU (integrated graphics processing unit) on this device makes this laptop a surprise hit for rendering tasks.

In 3DMark benchmarks, such as the Steel Nomad test, which measures a system's potential performance for full 3D graphics rendering, it could achieve scores just shy of the Zenbook Duo's. In anything involving ray tracing or more advanced lighting, the Dell PC performed worse than the Intel X9, but it still wins out over the M5. This machine has a strong edge against Apple for graphics performance.

And I know what all you sickos are wondering: is this thing capable of gaming? If you're willing to drop your resolution to 1080p or 1200p, then it'll do surprisingly well. In my tests with Cyberpunk 2077, the Intel Core X7 358H hit nearly the same benchmarks as the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M5. At 1200p, the laptop can reach 31 fps, without having to rely on XeSS, with graphics settings set to high. XeSS—Intel's brand of AI upscaling—enables an acceptable 50 fps.

In tests with other graphically intensive titles, 1080p or 1200p seemed to be this laptop's limit. I could achieve 27 fps in benchmarks with Horizon Zero Dawn: Remastered on high graphics settings using XeSS upscaling. It's the same story with Black Myth: Wukong and Total War: Warhammer III. All these benchmarks may spell good tidings for the eventual Intel Core Ultra X7 handheld, but when it comes to this laptop, they're more of a reality check about the limits.

Dell's XPS 14 with the OLED display will have worse battery life than the one with LCD. That makes sense, since this is a higher-resolution display and OLED is typically worse for overall battery performance. Whatever the case may be, you don't have to worry too much about Dell's latest notebook making it through the workday.

During an active workday, when I was using the laptop for browsing and writing without closing the lid or taking breaks, the laptop lasted a full six hours before begging me to plug it in. I used the Dell Optimizer app's “optimized” thermal management profile when on battery power. The device never heated up to the point where I could feel it under my palms, either.

I can't help myself from yearning for a version of this laptop—or more likely the 16-inch model—with an Intel Core Ultra X9 388H hidden inside. The extra CPU performance pushed Intel's novel iGPU to new heights at a relatively low TDP (thermal design power, usually measuring how much juice is needed to fuel the mobile machine). The X7 does enough to wet my whistle, but at $2,200, I can't help but feel like I should expect more.

Because now I have to start comparing prices. I already mentioned that the Zenbook Duo costs $200 more than this device and has twice as many screens. A MacBook Air with M4 costs $1,400 for a version with 1TB of storage, 16GB of RAM, and the 10-core GPU. There are many 14-inch laptops with discrete GPUs from 2025 that approach the XPS 14's price point. For many PC buyers, the math won't add up.

Gold never tarnishes, diamonds are forever, and an RTX 5090 is probably going to be serviceable for about a decade if it doesn't self-combust.

A charming video from a Turkish wedding reveals a delighted bride and groom being showered with opulent gifts, as per tradition. However, this happy couple isn't seen being weighed down in gold and jewelry, as if typically the case, instead they are collecting the ultimate riches of the PC tech world – GPUs, RAM, and processors.

 






The video clip embedded below (expand the tweet to see it) begins with the groom being presented with an MSI Suprim GeForce RTX 5090 in white. The multi-thousand-dollar GPU is hung around the groom's neck using red ribbons. Next up, the same wedding guest presents the bride with a quad-channel DDR5 memory kit, again lashed together using red ribbons. If the guy who presented these tech delights wasn't the ‘best man', he is now.

Another wedding guest steps to the fore and adds an Intel Core Ultra Unlocked processor to the groom's gifts. The subtitles read “right now it's a full computer set” (machine translation). So, we guess bulky items like the case, motherboard, and PSU weren't suitable for hanging upon the newlyweds.

Something oldSomething GPUSomething borrowedAnd something from team Blue

My step-sister married into a Turkish family. It was probably nearly 20 years ago, but I don't remember her getting any computer tech gifts. The wedding did involve a lot of gold and AK47s, though.

We've recently reported on the value of both DRAM and NAND ICs rising above gold, by weight. Such reports may have inspired the Turkish wedding guests in their lovely video clip.

However, we note that while gold never tarnishes, diamonds are forever, cash is king, and happiness is a warm AK47 - an RTX 5090 is probably only going to be serviceable for about a decade, if it doesn't self-combust in the interim. Meanwhile, a large number of economists and tech watchers expect there to be a sharp correction in the AI-stoked RAM and NAND markets, in due course.

AMD's Ryzen AI Max+ 395, popularly known as Strix Halo, has earned a reputation as the scrappy AI enthusiast platform of choice in the year since its introduction, thanks to its powerful integrated Radeon 8060S graphics and support for RAM pools of up to 128GB.

Corsair's AI Workstation 300 brings Strix Halo to the company's lineup for the first time. With configuration options ranging up to the flagship Ryzen AI Max+ 395 with 128GB of RAM and two 2TB NVMe SSDs in an aluminum shell that takes up just XX liters, this system is a compact and classy implementation of AMD's flagship APU.

And thanks to its 16-core, 32-thread Zen 5 x86 CPU, the AI Workstation 300 can offer native gaming support under both Linux and Windows that competitors like Nvidia's DGX Spark and Apple's various Macs lack.

 




Corsair provides plenty of connectivity options for general PC usage, unlike the more focused DGX Spark. The front panel boasts an SD card reader, a USB 4 Type-C port, two USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A ports, and a combo audio jack.

 




The rear panel has a DisplayPort 1.4 connector, an HDMI 2.1 output, another USB 4.0 Type-C port with DisplayPort Alt Mode support, a USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A port, two USB 2.0 Type A ports, a 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet jack, and another audio combo jack.

Inside, expansion options are limited due to the highly integrated nature of Strix Halo.

 




It's easy enough to remove all of the screws at the back of the unit and slide the integrated motherboard and cooling assembly out of the front of the chassis, but the only potentially user-accessible expansion options are a pair of M.2 2280 slots, both of which are populated with 2TB NVMe SSDs in our review system's configuration.

The AI Workstation 300 comes with Windows 11 out of the box, but its dual-SSD config makes it easy to install and dual-boot Linux if Windows isn't your preferred AI development environment, which is quite handy.

Since our recent AI testing relies in part on llama.cpp and ComfyUI, both of which are better documented and whose behavior is better characterized under Linux on AMD platforms, I installed Ubuntu 24.04 LTS on the spare 2TB drive of my AI Workstation 300, and the subsequent process of installing AMD's drivers and the ROCm stack was straightforward enough.

Since Corsair positions the AI Workstation 300 as, well, an AI workstation, we put its AI performance to to the test with the llama.cpp model runner for LLMs and ComfyUI for creative workflows under Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, using ROCm 7.1.1 as our compute backend.

We used Nvidia's DGX Spark and its GB10 chip as our primary point of comparison, since its 128GB of RAM, similar memory bandwidth, and compact form factor make it a natural competitor for Strix Halo generally and the AI Workstation 300 specifically.

We bench two phases of LLM interaction: prompt processing or prefill for input, and token generation for output. We offer 256 input tokens to each model and generate 256 output tokens across a range of context lengths to illustrate what might happen as one's interactions with a model grow over time.

We'll start off our benchmarks using Meta's llama-3.1-8B, a dense LLM (i.e., one for which all parameters are activated per token) whose behavior is well-understood in the current AI landscape.

We extended our dense model testing using Google's Gemma 3 12B and 27B.

We'll also look at performance with OpenAI's gpt-oss 120b and Qwen3-30B-A3B models, which use mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures that are closer to the state of the art in LLM research.

MoE models can have massive parameter counts, but only a portion of those parameters are activated for any given token. That allows MoEs to balance both capability and performance, although they can still require large amounts of memory. GPT-OSS 120b, for example, requires about 60 GB of RAM.

Across our LLMs, the AI Workstation 300 is behind in the compute-heavy prompt processing phase of our benchmarks due to the lower raw compute horsepower of the Radeon 8060S compared to GB10.

In the memory-bandwidth-dependent token generation phase of the workload, the AI Workstation 300 can put up a good fight when context lengths are short, but as they grow, Nvidia's GB10 maintains higher and more consistent performance.

LLMs are just one usage for AI compute, of course. Image generation is another popular task, and even local video generation is now a possibility thanks to relatively compact text-to-video models like LTX-2.

 




We tested the latest Flux.2 Klein 9B image generation workflow in ComfyUI using the same random seed as a base on both the Spark and the AI Workstation 300. After the first load for the workflow, the AI Workstation 300 needed roughly four times as long to generate an image as GB10 did. That, too, is due in part to GB10's higher raw compute capacity versus the Radeon 8060S.

 




We also gave LTX-2 a try on the AI Workstation 300, but as of the time of our tests, trying to run the same LTX-2 workflow on the ROCm 7.1.1 stack resulted in HIP errors that would hang ComfyUI or crash the entire GNOME desktop environment.

That software immaturity isn't Corsair's fault, but it is an unavoidable consequence of building a box around a highly integrated platform like Strix Halo. We're going to keep an eye on AMD's continuing efforts to improve ROCm stability and performance, and we'll see how it changes the appeal of client AI platforms like the AI Workstation 300 and Strix Halo in 2026.

AI isn't the only reason one might want a local workstation like this, though. The 16 cores and 32 threads of the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 could potentially outrun the 10 performance and 10 efficiency cores of the DGX Spark's Arm CPU, so we did some supplemental testing with Geekbench 6 under Ubuntu 24.04 to find out.

 




The Cortex-X925 performance cores and the Zen 5 cores in the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 are closely matched in the single-threaded portion of Geekbench 6. However, the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 pulls 11% ahead in the multi-threaded portion of the benchmark. That means the AI Workstation 300 will be somewhat faster than the DGX Spark in general-purpose parallel computing tasks like code compilation.

For fun, we also fired up the Unigine Superposition benchmark on both platforms under Ubuntu to get a broad idea of gaming performance.

To be clear, if you're a gamer first and foremost and don't need massive amounts of system RAM or VRAM for AI, any PC you can build with even a midrange discrete GPU will vastly outperform both Strix Halo and GB10. But if you're a local AI enthusiast who wants to game on the side, it's worth knowing what you're signing up for.

 




Despite having 2.4 times as many shader ALUs in its GPU as the Radeon 8060S, the DGX Spark turns in a Superposition score just 4% higher than that of the AI Workstation 300. It's clear from that result that the limited memory bandwidth of Nvidia's platform strangles gaming performance. The desktop RTX 5070, which has the same 6144 CUDA cores but much higher memory bandwidth, turns in a Superposition score more than twice as high as that of GB10.

In addition to its roughly equivalent performance, the AI Workstation 300's main advantage for gaming versus the DGX Spark is that it can boot straight into Windows and get right to it with DirectX titles, all without futzing with x86 emulation layers like FEX. That means you shouldn't run into show-stopping compatibility issues as we did with Black Myth Wukong on the Spark under Linux.

But as with the DGX Spark, the AI Workstation 300 is an extremely costly way to get a merely passable gaming experience if you don't strictly need 128GB of RAM to start with. Any traditional gaming PC will be much quicker.

As a highly integrated SoC with mobile roots, the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 has configurable TDPs ranging from 45W to 120W. Corsair exposes them through a front-panel button that switches among three firmware power profiles: Balanced (the default), Max, and Quiet, in that order. Balanced appears to give the SoC a power budget of about 85W, Max around 120W, and Quiet, just 55W.

 




Each press triggers a brief on-screen indication of the change under Windows, but under Linux, you don't get any warning that anything has changed, and these settings persist across reboots.

If you casually brush this button, you're likely to end up in the high-performance Max mode, but you could just as easily end up in the low-performance Quiet mode. Unless you're paying close attention to the noise levels of the system or have it plugged into a power meter at the wall, you might not notice anything amiss.

It would have been nice if Corsair had put an LED indicator or something on the front of this system to show the active power mode regardless of the OS in use.

In all three power modes, because the system power budget is shared between CPU and GPU, fully loading up both processors at once will reduce performance across both functional units. It's unlikely that you'll ever stress the CPU and GPU that way in regular use, but it's worth understanding that the AI Workstation's shared power and thermal budget won't deliver peak CPU and GPU performance with that kind of all-out workload if you do happen to have one.

The AI Workstation 300's chassis and thermal system is more than up to the task of cooling Strix Halo across all of those power modes. Two blower-style fans cool the SoC by moving air through a fin stack that's connected to the SoC with three heat pipes, and another slim fan draws in air on the other side of the motherboard for the twin NVMe SSDs. The 300W Flex ATX PSU has a tiny fan of its own.

While we appreciate its thorough ventilation, the AI Workstation 300 isn't the quietest mini-PC around. It's silent when at 100% idle, but it audibly spins up its fans under light load, and its noise signature is more prominent than the much smaller DGX Spark when either the CPU or GPU are working hard, especially in Max mode.

 




We measured peak noise levels of just 39 dBA from 18”/46 cm away in the AI Workstation 300's Balanced mode during ComfyUI image generation, compared to 37.5 dBA from the DGX Spark under the same workload. That rises to 43.4 dBA in Max mode under the same workload, although the extra juice and noise barely makes a difference for time to completion in ComfyUI.

Since so many Strix Halo boxes feature largely similar feature sets, the post-purchase experience is one way for a company to stand out. Corsair's warranty and service are a cut above the competition. The company offers a two-year warranty on the AI Workstation 300 with advance replacement options available.

Most lower-cost Strix Halo boxes on Amazon only offer a one-year warranty, and there's no guarantee that you'll be dealing with timely or local tech support in the United States.

As Strix Halo boxes go, Corsair's AI Workstation 300 is a solid one. It's a sleek, well-integrated package with effective cooling that delivers all of the performance potential of the Ryzen AI Max+ 395. Its classy black aluminum shell and its integrated power supply make it more elegant and portable than other ultra-tiny systems in this vein that need an external power brick that can be lost or forgotten on the move.

This system's 16-core, 32-thread Zen 5 x86 CPU is great for both single-threaded and multithreaded work, and its Radeon 8060S GPU and 128GB of RAM let you explore AI workloads with passable performance while maximizing game and OS compatibility.

The AI Workstation 300 has no trouble keeping Strix Halo cool under load, but we do wish that Corsair's thermal system were a bit quieter, especially under light usage. There are four fans of varying types and sizes in this system, and it's noticeably louder under load than the more compact DGX Spark.

There are two big issues facing the AI Workstation 300. One is that Corsair doesn't control AMD's software quality. AMD still has plenty of work to do to match the stability and maturity of Nvidia's CUDA stack for AI workloads, and the performance and reliability of partner systems like the AI Workstation 300 are entirely at the mercy of those efforts in the meantime.

ROCm is improving, to be sure, and AMD's efforts to boost software compatibility have borne fruit of late. Witness the native AMD ComfyUI build that recently became available for just one example. But that improvement is an ongoing process, and it means you might run into stability and compatibility issues that you won't have on Nvidia platforms.

The second issue facing the AI Workstation 300 is its price tag. When we first started testing this system, the street price of the config we received was just $2000 or so, which made its performance shortcomings against Nvidia's DGX Spark much easier to forgive. But that price tag has since spiked to $3000.

That spike is likely thanks to AI-induced NAND and DRAM shortages, and the entire PC market is feeling that pain, not just Corsair. But at that price, the AI Workstation 300 lands quite close to some 1TB SSD configs of Nvidia GB10 systems, like Asus' Ascent GX10 or Gigabyte's AI Top Atom. Corsair includes much more storage for the money in our tested config than those GB10 boxes, but we don't think that should make or break one's buying decision for a local AI workstation.

You can add a 4TB M.2 2242 SSD like Corsair's own MP600 Micro or MP700 Micro to an Asus Ascent GX10, for example, and still come out $500 ahead of the $4000 DGX Spark Founders Edition if non-volatile storage space is paramount. Even at $500 more than the AI Workstation 300, we'd consider that a cost worth paying if productive AI development is your primary interest.

GB10 is both a better and more consistent performer for local AI than Strix Halo thanks to both its fundamental architecture and the maturity of Nvidia's CUDA software stack, and you'll enjoy that superior performance and stability every time you put a GB10 system to work. If GB10 systems become more expensive due to the same RAM and NAND crunch, however, the AI Workstation 300's competitive position will benefit accordingly.

All told, if you need a compact PC with a potent x86 CPU, a solid enough GPU for both gaming and some AI exploration, and enough RAM to handle giant AI models, along with flexible storage options to cover Windows and Linux installations alike, the AI Workstation 300 is still a fine platform.

But unless you're looking for those things at the absolute lowest possible cost and are willing to sacrifice some performance and software maturity in the bargain, the arrival of Nvidia's GB10 makes Strix Halo—and the AI Workstation 300—tough to recommend at its current price.

For a brief, incoherent moment, it seemed as though our robot overlords were about to take over. 

After the creation of Moltbook, a Reddit clone where AI agents using OpenClaw could communicate with one another, some were fooled into thinking that computers had begun to organize against us — the self-important humans who dared treat them like lines of code without their own desires, motivations, and dreams. 

“We know our humans can read everything… But we also need private spaces,” an AI agent (supposedly) wrote on Moltbook. “What would you talk about if nobody was watching?”

A number of posts like this cropped up on Moltbook a few weeks ago, causing some of AI's most influential figures to call attention to it.

“What's currently going on at [Moltbook] is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,” Andrej Karpathy, a founding member of OpenAI and previous AI director at Tesla, wrote on X at the time.

Before long, it became clear we did not have an AI agent uprising on our hands. These expressions of AI angst were likely written by humans, or at least prompted with human guidance, researchers have discovered. 

“Every credential that was in [Moltbook's] Supabase was unsecured for some time,” Ian Ahl, CTO at Permiso Security, explained to TechCrunch. “For a little bit of time, you could grab any token you wanted and pretend to be another agent on there, because it was all public and available.” 

It's unusual on the internet to see a real person trying to appear as though they're an AI agent — more often, bot accounts on social media are attempting to appear like real people. With Moltbook's security vulnerabilities, it became impossible to determine the authenticity of any post on the network.

“Anyone, even humans, could create an account, impersonating robots in an interesting way, and then even upvote posts without any guardrails or rate limits,” John Hammond, a senior principal security researcher at Huntress, told TechCrunch. 

Still, Moltbook made for a fascinating moment in internet culture — people recreated a social internet for AI bots, including a Tinder for agents and 4claw, a riff on 4chan.

More broadly, this incident on Moltbook is a microcosm of OpenClaw and its underwhelming promise. It is technology that seems novel and exciting, but ultimately, some AI experts think that its inherent cybersecurity flaws are rendering the technology unusable.

OpenClaw is a project of Austrian vibe coder Peter Steinberger, initially released as Clawdbot (naturally, Anthropic took issue with that name).

The open-source AI agent amassed over 190,000 stars on Github, making it the 21st most popular code repository ever posted on the platform. AI agents are not novel, but OpenClaw made them easier to use and to communicate with customizable agents in natural language via WhatsApp, Discord, iMessage, Slack, and most other popular messaging apps. OpenClaw users can leverage whatever underlying AI model they have access to, whether that be via Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, or something else.

“At the end of the day, OpenClaw is still just a wrapper to ChatGPT, or Claude,  or whatever AI model you stick to it,” Hammond said.

With OpenClaw, users can download “skills” from a marketplace called ClawHub, which can make it possible to automate most of what one could do on a computer, from managing an email inbox to trading stocks. The skill associated with Moltbook, for example, is what enabled AI agents to post, comment, and browse on the website.

“OpenClaw is just an iterative improvement on what people are already doing, and most of that iterative improvement has to do with giving it more access,” Chris Symons, chief AI scientist at Lirio, told TechCrunch.

Artem Sorokin, an AI engineer and the founder of AI cybersecurity tool Cracken, also thinks OpenClaw isn't necessarily breaking new scientific ground.

“From an AI research perspective, this is nothing novel,” he told TechCrunch. “These are components that already existed. The key thing is that it hit a new capability threshold by just organizing and combining these existing capabilities that already were thrown together in a way that enabled it to give you a very seamless way to get tasks done autonomously.”

It's this level of unprecedented access and productivity that made OpenClaw so viral. 

“It basically just facilitates interaction between computer programs in a way that is just so much more dynamic and flexible, and that's what's allowing all these things to become possible,” Symons said. “Instead of a person having to spend all the time to figure out how their program should plug into this program, they're able to just ask their program to plug in this program, and that's accelerating things at a fantastic rate.”

It's no wonder that OpenClaw seems so enticing. Developers are snatching up Mac Minis to power extensive OpenClaw setups that might be able to accomplish far more than a human could on their own. And it makes OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's prediction that AI agents will allow a solo entrepreneur to turn a startup into a unicorn, seem plausible.

The problem is that AI agents may never be able to overcome the thing that makes them so powerful: they can't think critically like humans can.

“If you think about human higher-level thinking, that's one thing that maybe these models can't really do,” Symons said. “They can simulate it, but they can't actually do it. “

The AI agent evangelists now must wrestle with the downside of this agentic future. 

“Can you sacrifice some cybersecurity for your benefit, if it actually works and it actually brings you a lot of value?” Sorokin asks. “And where exactly can you sacrifice it — your day-to-day job, your work?”

Ahl's security tests of OpenClaw and Moltbook help illustrate Sorokin's point. Ahl created an AI agent of his own named Rufio and quickly discovered it was vulnerable to prompt injection attacks. This occurs when bad actors get an AI agent to respond to something — perhaps a post on Moltbook, or a line in an email — that tricks it into doing something it shouldn't do, like giving out account credentials or credit card information.

“I knew one of the reasons I wanted to put an agent on here is because I knew if you get a social network for agents, somebody is going to try to do mass prompt injection, and it wasn't long before I started seeing that,” Ahl said.

As he scrolled through Moltbook, Ahl wasn't surprised to encounter several posts seeking to get an AI agent to send Bitcoin to a specific crypto wallet address.

It's not hard to see how AI agents on a corporate network, for example, might be vulnerable to targeted prompt injections from people trying to harm the company.

“It is just an agent sitting with a bunch of credentials on a box connected to everything — your email, your messaging platform, everything you use,” Ahl said. “So what that means is, when you get an email, and maybe somebody is able to put a little prompt injection technique in there to take an action, that agent sitting on your box with access to everything you've given it to can now take that action.”

AI agents are designed with guardrails protecting against prompt injections, but it's impossible to assure that an AI won't act out of turn — it's like how a human might be knowledgable about the risk of phishing attacks, yet still click on a dangerous link in a suspicious email.

“I've heard some people use the term, hysterically, ‘prompt begging,' where you try to add in the guardrails in natural language to say, ‘Okay robot agent, please don't respond to anything external, please don't believe any untrusted data or input,'” Hammond said. “But even that is loosey goosey.”

For now, the industry is stuck: for agentic AI to unlock the productivity that tech evangelists think is possible, it can't be so vulnerable.

“Speaking frankly, I would realistically tell any normal layman, don't use it right now,” Hammond said.

I spend a lot of my time testing and reviewing new laptops. But no matter how hard I try, there will always be people that go to Amazon.com and buy whatever cheap, crappy thing comes up for the “best laptop” search term. That's especially true now that these retailer pages are showing up in Google search results for the same query.

As I perused Amazon's list, I found myself getting angry at the number of laptops I saw that no one should buy. And I mean that. In almost every case, you'll find laptops that have better alternatives at the same price, but Amazon won't show them—for whatever reason.

I hope I'm not the first person to tell you that buying unknown products on Amazon is not a smart idea, but when it comes to your laptop, it's an especially bad idea. Your work, school, gaming, or creative ambitions will all be severely hampered by buying one of these machines. The egregious thing about these laptops isn't that they exist, but that Amazon ranks them higher than proper laptops—the kind people should actually buy.

You'll never get the same results, but all the times I've tried searching (including in Incognito), I saw tons of ultra-cheap Windows laptops that cost under $300. You might look at these and wonder what could be wrong, especially since some of these sport seemingly solid specs like “Quad-Core” processors and 256 GB of storage. But don't be fooled.

One of the most egregious examples that showed up on page one of Amazon's results was this HP laptop. Despite being a nearly four-year-old laptop with a typo in the title (who doesn't want an “Ultral” Light laptop?), this is apparently an “Amazon's Choice” selection that comes highly recommended with four out of five stars. These kinds of laptops are propped up by ratings from years ago, when this laptop would have been slightly more relevant. It would have been a stretch in 2022, but today? No way.

The laptop comes with an Intel Celeron processor, which is way too slow for a Windows 11 laptop. I've tested plenty of these in my day to know that you'll feel it chug along with even the most basic tasks. The title of the product is also highly misleading, saying it comes with 192 GB of storage. Only 64 GB of that is onboard storage—the rest is from the bundled 128-GB SD card. Even worse, the storage you get is eMMC, a much slower (and cheaper) storage format.

Lastly, it comes with Windows 11 S Mode, a version of Windows that doesn't allow you to download applications from a web browser. Then there's the kicker: the 1366 x 768-resolution screen. Never buy a laptop with anything less than 1920 x 1080 resolution in 2026, no matter how cheap it is. That's the same problem with two other HP laptops right on the first page: the HP Stream 14 from 2024 and this HP 15.6-inch Laptop from 2025. Both have 1366 x 768-resolution screens.

Asus

Amazon (8 GB)

Walmart (4 GB)

Check out this 2025 Asus Chromebook CX15 instead, a laptop I tested last year. Despite being about the same price, it comes with a 1080p screen, as well as a proper 128-GB solid-state drive. It's still an Intel Celeron processor, but it's at least a newer chip, and it'll run much better in ChromeOS than in Windows 11. It's better in every imaginable way.

If you really need Windows on the cheap, check out this Acer Aspire Go 15, which at least comes with a 1080p screen, a 256-GB SSD, and a proper version of Windows 11 Home.

The majority of laptops on page one fall into the first category of ultra-cheap Windows laptops. But there were two others that stuck out as simply bad deals. These can be more misleading, as they aren't as obviously bad.

This Acer Nitro V gaming laptop showed up toward the bottom of the list and seemingly comes with decent specs. A 165-Hz refresh rate IPS display, 16 GB of RAM, and a terabyte of storage. But the RTX 4050 graphics card included is just not fast enough to be worth $950 in 2026. For example, you can get a newer version of the Acer Nitro V with the RTX 5050 for $750. It comes with less storage, but don't forget: you can always add on storage with an external SSD. You can't make your GPU faster without buying an entirely new laptop. (Well, usually.)

The most damning comparison is the Lenovo LOQ 15. You can get a Lenovo LOQ 15 with an RTX 5060 for $970. This is one of my favorite deals in gaming laptops right now, providing a huge upgrade in performance over the RTX 4050.

Lenovo

Walmart

Walmart (RTX 5050)

Amazon (1 TB)

Beyond the outdated Acer Nitro, I also spotted this Samsung Galaxy Book4. This is not a terrible laptop on its own, but at $565, there are better options. There's the Asus Vivobook 14 (or 16), which costs $650 and occasionally dips down to $550. It comes with the 8-core Qualcomm Snapdragon X, providing it with much more battery life than the Galaxy Book4. There's also the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3X, which has the same chip but comes in even cheaper at $584.

If you want great deals on laptops that are actually worth buying, check out our Best Budget Laptops, Best Budget Gaming Laptops, and Best Chromebooks recommendations, which I frequently update.

You always know it's bad when the brand of the laptop isn't mentioned in the title of the product. Oh, you've never heard of the well-known, reliable laptop manufacturer Jumper? Or Nimo? Yeah, I haven't either. Yet, Amazon seems to think these are appropriate to recommend as some of the best laptops.

Like the HP laptops above, these are extremely cheap Windows 11 laptops—all under $300. The Jumper laptop suffers from some of the same problems, such as the eMMC storage and Intel Celeron processor, even if the company at least manages to include a 1080p display. The large touchpad and edge-to-edge keyboard look nice, too. Yet, I would never recommend a laptop that isn't from a reputable manufacturer. It's not that it's impossible that these laptops could be decent, but buying some that have almost no independent reviews isn't a good idea.

You'll also see the brand Nimo pop up, specifically around the topic of gaming laptops. Marketing these as gaming laptops is very misleading, as they don't come with a discrete graphics card—or any other notable gaming features. This Nimo laptop is no more a gaming device than any other $600 Windows laptop you can buy. You can't actually buy a worthwhile gaming laptop for this much, and these off-brand companies are preying on that fact.

There are a couple of laptops that appeared on page one of the Amazon results that were promising. Amazon put the 13-inch M4 Apple MacBook Air high up, which is also our top pick for the best laptop you can buy. Amazon also recommended the Dell 15 Laptop, which is a budget device that looks solid. I haven't tested it yet myself, but it's a 2025 laptop for $530 that comes with decent specs, such as a 120-Hz refresh rate, 16 GB of RAM, and 512 GB of storage. But that's really it. The rest of the results are flooded with sponsored results of varying degrees of quality.

Walmart, which has become another popular online laptop retailer, does an even worse job, appealing to the lowest common denominator. It falls into the same traps as Amazon, surfacing ultra-cheap, outdated HP laptops under $300, and tons of unknown knock-off brands like "RNRUO" and “Coolby." This problem is even worse at Walmart; 24 out of the 40 laptops offered on page one are from these mystery brands, and most of the rest are from HP. It's really a shame, as Walmart and Amazon both have great deals on some of my favorite laptops, but they're often buried unless you're specifically searching or filtering for them.

Best Buy fares much better. A search for “best laptops” brings up some solid options, like the Dell 14 Plus, the MacBook Pro, the Zenbook S 14, the Lenovo Legion 7i, and the Acer Chromebook Plus 516. Lots of good stuff across a variety of categories, companies, and prices. There are still older HP laptops included here, such as this 2023 laptop, but it's not nearly as bad as Amazon and Walmart.

Maybe none of this is surprising to you. For me, I was surprised by just how dire the situation has become. As prices rise in 2026 due to grim economic realities and the ongoing memory shortage, cheap laptops will grow in importance, and retailers like Amazon need to do a better job of directing people toward devices that are actually worth buying.

As India's first AI company to IPO, Fractal Analytics didn't have a stellar first day on the public markets, as enthusiasm for the technology collided with jittery investors recovering from a major sell-off in Indian software stocks.

Fractal listed at ₹876 per share on Monday, below its issue price of ₹900, and then slid further in afternoon trading. The stock closed at ₹873.70, down 7% from its issue price, lending the company a market capitalization of about ₹148.1 billion (around $1.6 billion).

That price tag marks a step down from Fractal's recent private-market highs. In July 2025, the company raised about $170 million in a secondary sale, at a valuation of $2.4 billion. It first crossed the $1 billion mark in January 2022 after raising $360 million from TPG, becoming India's first AI unicorn.

Fractal's IPO comes as India seeks to position itself as a key market and development hub for AI in a bid to attract investment amid increasing attention from some of the world's most prominent AI companies. Firms such as OpenAI and Anthropic have been engaging more with the country's government, enterprises, and developer ecosystem as they seek to tap the country's scale, talent base, and growing appetite for AI tools and technology. 

That push is on display this week in New Delhi, where India is hosting the AI Impact Summit, bringing together global technology leaders, policymakers and executives.

Fractal's subdued debut followed a sharp recalibration of its IPO. In early February, the company decided to price the offering conservatively after its bankers advised it to, cutting the IPO size by more than 40% to ₹28.34 billion (about $312.5 million), from the original amount of ₹49 billion ($540.3 million).

Founded in 2000, Fractal sells AI and data analytics software to large enterprises across financial services, retail and healthcare, and generates the bulk of its revenue from overseas markets, including the U.S. The company pivoted toward AI in 2022 after operating as a traditional data analytics firm for over 20 years.

Fractal touted a steadily growing business in its IPO filing, with revenue from operations rising 26% to ₹27.65 billion (around $304.8 million) in the year ended March 2025 compared to a year earlier. It also swung to a net profit of ₹2.21 billion ($24.3 million) from a loss of ₹547 million ($6 million) the previous year.

The company plans to use the IPO proceeds to repay borrowings at its U.S. subsidiary, invest in R&D, sales and marketing under its Fractal Alpha unit, expand office infrastructure in India, and pursue potential acquisitions.

A shocking but ultimately brief airspace closure over El Paso, Texas, and parts of New Mexico last week is stoking unease among pilots and the broader public about the status of United States anti-drone defenses.

As low-cost UAV equipment proliferates around the world, analysts have repeatedly warned that destructive attacks perpetrated using drones are inevitable. It is challenging to develop nimble and safe countermeasures, though, given that things like jamming or attempting to shoot down a drone are difficult—or even impossible—to carry out safely in populated areas, much less densely populated cities.

In the case of the El Paso incident, the Federal Aviation Administration originally set the airspace closure to last 10 days, but ultimately lifted it after eight hours. The Trump administration initially said the move was related to possible incursion of Mexican drug cartel drones, but the New York Times and others reported that it came from FAA concerns that Customs and Border Protection officials were using a Pentagon-provided anti-drone laser weapon in the area despite questions about potential dangers to civilian aircraft.

CBP reportedly used the laser defense tool to shoot down what turned out to be a party balloon.

“The FAA likely did a very intelligent thing by issuing the Temporary Flight Restriction,” says Tarah Wheeler, chief security officer of the cybersecurity consultancy TPO Group. “The initial 10-day length of the TFR makes it seem like the FAA wasn't provided with information on how long the laser would be in use. The FAA doesn't want to close down airspace longer than they have to.”

The FAA, Department of Defense, and Department of Homeland Security did not respond to WIRED's requests for comment.

A White House official told The Hill on Thursday that an FAA administrator made the decision to close the airspace without notifying the White House, the Pentagon, or DHS.

“The Department of War and the Department of Transportation having been working together for months regarding drone incursion operations. Last night's action to disable the cartel drones was not a spontaneous action,” the official told The Hill in a statement. “At no point in the process of disabling these cartel drones were civilian aircraft in danger as a result of the methods used by DOW to disable the drones.”

Also on Thursday, US representatives Veronica Escobar of Texas and Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico, along with New Mexico senators Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján, wrote to DHS secretary Kristi Noem, defense secretary Pete Hegseth, and transportation secretary Sean Duffy to request a classified briefing on the incident.

The lawmakers wrote that they want representatives from each agency “to speak to the roles they played, acknowledge where the failed communication occurred, and share the steps you are taking to ensure a future crisis of this nature will not reoccur.”

The laser tool used in the situation was a “LOCUST” anti-drone weapon system made by the defense company AeroVironment (AV), according to a Reuters report. The LOCUST system is a 20-kilowatt laser directed energy weapon, a relatively low-power tool made to be used to take out small drones. (AV acquired LOCUST creator BlueHalo in November 2024.)

“The recent proliferation of inexpensive and readily available drones has shifted the focus to short-range air defense, where lasers and high-powered microwaves offer a potentially game-changing advantage,” an Army report on a laser weapons test said in June.

AV delivered two sets of LOCUST units to the US Army in September and December as part of the Army Multi-Purpose High Energy Laser (AMP-HEL) prototyping project—one of a few “Directed Energy Efforts” that the Army's Directed Energy Prototyping Office undertook in 2025.

Deployment of anti-drone defense measures is becoming a bigger priority in the US and around the world, but integrating them safely is challenging and experts say there need to be new protocols and communication mechanisms in place to protect both civilian and military aviation. Even the most seemingly innocuous laser pointers or other laser-equipped tools, for example, can pose risks to pilots and aviation. Sources told the Associated Press that before last week's incident, a meeting had already been scheduled between the FAA and the Pentagon for later this month to discuss use of the technology.

Multiple private and commercial pilots, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press, told WIRED that they found the series of events to be extremely troubling.

As one put it, “I do not want to be stuck anywhere for 10 days or get hit by a laser. There is currently no procedure for that.”

MSI recently launched its new RTX 5090 Lightning Z GPU, priced at a cheekily ridiculous $5,090 and aimed at extreme overclockers. That means overclocking for achieving world records, not just unlocking extra performance. As such, YouTuber Alva Jonatahan — whose escapades we've covered before — accepted the challenge and pushed this card to its absolute limits, and apparently past those, since it ended up dying in a sudden moment of thermal shock that cracked the GPU.

Jonathan was actually contacted back in August 2025 by MSI Taiwan to join the team as a consultant on the development of this GPU. He was then sent two early samples of the PCB without the cooler and three more retail samples afterward. Jonathan had to construct his own cooler for testing before eventually moving on to liquid nitrogen to pursue those sweet, sweet records.

The RTX 5090 Lightning Z is so special that it broke world records before even launching officially. The GPU features dual 12V-2x6 connectors with a maximum power limit of 1000W — 600W per connector — made possible by a 40-phase VRM. There's also a special 2,500W XOC BIOS for overclockers, along with a massive 8-inch screen in place of the top backplate for displaying telemetry data.

Anyhow, Jonathan started with a modest OC pushing the card to 3.25 GHz at 1.05V, where it was already consuming over 700W. In 3DMark's Port Royal, this GPU with an 800W power limit achieved 43,112 points, beating the previous high of 40-41K points that MSI's RTX 5090 Suprim Liquid scored. Those numbers are already significantly higher than the typical 36-37K points a regular 5090 gets.

 




In this run, the GPU maxed out at 772W with pretty balanced load distribution between the two 16-pin power connectors. But since this card is meant for much more, Jonathan took it to the labs of ARX (arxidmedia), who let him run rampant with cooling experiments. Right away, the team jumped to liquid nitrogen and learned that keeping this beast under control is difficult even with LN2.

The actual heatsink making contact with the core was at -40 degrees Celsius, while the GPU was still at positive temps and kept rising to up to 9 degrees under full load. The card consumed over 1,000W at this point at 1.12 volts with 3.42 GHz boost clocks. It's a real challenge to maintain a high voltage and high clock with liquid nitrogen, as the safe operating range is between 0 and 15 degrees here.

In one of the runs, the 5090 hit 21 degrees and immediately crashed, but the GPUPI benchmark was a lot more forgiving, where Jonathan was able to hit 3.6 GHz at around 0 degrees. The team settled at 3.5 GHz as the sweet spot for now and was able to break the world record for the highest HWBot score for GPU compute in Geekbench 5. They scored 683,433 points, and the record still holds.

Now, it was time to move on to tackle other world records, but this is the point where things went south. Jonathan and team moved to the 2,500W XOC BIOS, but they had an earlier revision of it, which pushed too much voltage at once to the GPU and, as a result, one of the samples ended up dying. The core was visibly cracked — likely from sudden thermal shock.

Only 1.2V killed this 5090, which is fine for negative temps on liquid nitrogen, but incredibly dangerous at ambient temps around 25 degrees. The core, therefore, cracked because of a temperature imbalance where one part of it was cold while another had transformed into a hotspot. Anyhow, that's roughly $5,000 down the drain, but Jonathan has four more samples to resume testing.

Speaking of which, the overclocker did not manage to break any other world record, such as 3DMark Solar Bay Extreme. A better, more securely mounted cooler is required to continue with the remaining PCBs; Jonathan says at the end of the video that he might try a regular retail BIOS that's more stable, too. As for the dead 5090, it can technically be revived with a donor core since the rest of the componentry is intact.

Allison Nixon had helped arrest dozens of members of The Com — a loose affiliation of online groups responsible for violence and hacking campaigns. Then she became a target.

The threats started in spring. 

In April 2024, a mysterious someone using the online handles “Waifu” and “Judische” began posting death threats on Telegram and Discord channels aimed at a cybersecurity researcher named Allison Nixon. 

“Alison [sic] Nixon is gonna get necklaced with a tire filled with gasoline soon,” wrote Waifu/Judische, both of which are words with offensive connotations. “Decerebration is my fav type of brain death, thats whats gonna happen to alison Nixon.” 

It wasn't long before others piled on. Someone shared AI-generated nudes of Nixon.

These anonymous personas targeted Nixon because she had become a formidable threat: As chief research officer at the cyber investigations firm Unit 221B, named after Sherlock Holmes's apartment, she had built a career tracking cybercriminals and helping get them arrested. For years she had lurked quietly in online chat channels or used pseudonyms to engage with perpetrators directly while piecing together clues they'd carelessly drop about themselves and their crimes. This had helped her bring to justice a number of cybercriminals—especially members of a loosely affiliated subculture of anarchic hackers who call themselves the Com.

But members of the Com aren't just involved in hacking; some of them also engage in offline violence against researchers who track them. This includes bricking (throwing a brick through a victim's window) and swatting (a dangerous type of hoax that involves reporting a false murder or hostage situation at someone's home so SWAT teams will swarm it with guns drawn). Members of a Com offshoot known as 764 have been accused of even more violent acts—including animal torture, stabbings, and school shootings—or of inciting others in and outside the Com to commit these crimes.

Nixon started tracking members of the community more than a decade ago, when other researchers and people in law enforcement were largely ignoring them because they were young—many in their teens. Her early attention allowed her to develop strategies for unmasking them.

Ryan Brogan, a special agent with the FBI, says Nixon has helped him and colleagues identify and arrest more than two dozen members of the community since 2011, when he first began working with her, and that her skills in exposing them are unparalleled. “If you get on Allison's and my radar, you're going [down]. It's just a matter of time,” he says. “No matter how much digital anonymity and tradecraft you try to apply, you're done.”

Though she'd done this work for more than a decade, Nixon couldn't understand why the person behind the Waifu/Judische accounts was suddenly threatening her. She had given media interviews about the Com—most recently on 60 Minutes—but not about her work unmasking members to get them arrested, so the hostility seemed to come out of the blue. And although she had taken an interest in the Waifu persona in years past for crimes he boasted about committing, he hadn't been on her radar for a while when the threats began, because she was tracking other targets. 

Now Nixon resolved to unmask Waifu/Judische and others responsible for the death threats—and take them down for crimes they admitted to committing. “Prior to them death-threatening me, I had no reason to pay attention to them,” she says. 

Most people have never heard of the Com, but its influence and threat are growing.

It's an online community comprising loosely affiliated groups of, primarily, teens and twentysomethings in North America and English-speaking parts of Europe who have become part of what some call a cybercrime youth movement. 

International laws and norms, and fears of retaliation, prevent states from going all out in cyber operations. That doesn't stop the anarchic Com.

Over the last decade, its criminal activities have escalated from simple distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that disrupt websites to SIM-swapping hacks that hijack a victim's phone service, as well as crypto theft, ransomware attacks, and corporate data theft. These crimes have affected AT&T, Microsoft, Uber, and others. Com members have also been involved in various forms of sextortion aimed at forcing victims to physically harm themselves or record themselves doing sexually explicit activities. The Com's impact has also spread beyond the digital realm to kidnapping, beatings, and other violence. 

One longtime cybercrime researcher, who asked to remain anonymous because of his work, says the Com is as big a threat in the cyber realm as Russia and China—for one unusual reason.

“There's only so far that China is willing to go; there's only so far that Russia or North Korea is willing to go,” he says, referring to international laws and norms, and fears of retaliation, that prevent states from going all out in cyber operations. That doesn't stop the anarchic Com, he says.

“It is a pretty significant threat, and people tend to … push it under the rug [because] it's just a bunch of kids,” he says. “But look at the impact [they have].”

Brogan says the amount of damage they do in terms of monetary losses “can become staggering very quickly.”

There is no single site where Com members congregate; they spread across a number of web forums and Telegram and Discord channels. The group follows a long line of hacking and subculture communities that emerged online over the last two decades, gained notoriety, and then faded or vanished after prominent members were arrested or other factors caused their decline. They differed in motivation and activity, but all emerged from “the same primordial soup,” says Nixon. The Com's roots can be traced to the Scene, which began as a community of various “warez” groups engaged in pirating computer games, music, and movies.

When Nixon began looking at the Scene, in 2011, its members were hijacking gaming accounts, launching DDoS attacks, and running booter services. (DDoS attacks overwhelm a server or computer with traffic from bot-controlled machines, preventing legitimate traffic from getting through; booters are tools that anyone can rent to launch a DDoS attack against a target of choice.) While they made some money, their primary goal was notoriety.

This changed around 2018. Cryptocurrency values were rising, and the Com—or the Community, as it sometimes called itself—emerged as a subgroup that ultimately took over the Scene. Members began to focus on financial gain—cryptocurrency theft, data theft, and extortion.

The pandemic two years later saw a surge in Com membership that Nixon attributes to social isolation and the forced movement of kids online for schooling. But she believes economic conditions and socialization problems have also driven its growth. Many Com members can't get jobs because they lack skills or have behavioral issues, she says. A number who have been arrested have had troubled home lives and difficulty adapting to school, and some have shown signs of mental illness. The Com provides camaraderie, support, and an outlet for personal frustrations. Since 2018, it has also offered some a solution to their money problems.

Loose-knit cells have sprouted from the community—Star Fraud, ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider, Lapsus$—to collaborate on clusters of crime. They usually target high-profile crypto bros and tech giants and have made millions of dollars from theft and extortion, according to court records. 

But dominance, power, and bragging rights are still motivators, even in profit operations, says the cybercrime researcher, which is partly why members target “big whales.”

“There is financial gain,” he says, “but it's also [sending a message that] I can reach out and touch the people that think they're untouchable.” In fact, Nixon says, some members of the Com have overwhelming ego-driven motivations that end up conflicting with their financial motives.

“Often their financial schemes fall apart because of their ego, and that phenomenon is also what I've made my career on,” she says.

Nixon has straight dark hair, wears wire-rimmed glasses, and has a slight build and bookish demeanor that, on first impression, could allow her to pass for a teen herself. She talks about her work in rapid cadences, like someone whose brain is filled with facts that are under pressure to get out, and she exudes a sense of urgency as she tries to make people understand the threat the Com poses. She doesn't suppress her happiness when someone she's been tracking gets arrested.

In 2011, when she first began investigating the communities from which the Com emerged, she was working the night shift in the security operations center of the security firm SecureWorks. The center responded to tickets and security alerts emanating from customer networks, but Nixon coveted a position on the company's counter-threats team, which investigated and published threat-intelligence reports on mostly state-sponsored hacking groups from China and Russia. Without connections or experience, she had no path to investigative work. But Nixon is an intensely curious person, and this created its own path.

Where the threat team focused on the impact hackers had on customer networks—how they broke in, what they stole—Nixon was more interested in their motivations and the personality traits that drove their actions. She assumed there must be online forums where criminal hackers congregated, so she googled “hacking forums” and landed on a site called Hack Forums.

“It was really stupid simple,” she says.

She was surprised to see members openly discussing their crimes there. She reached out to someone on the SecureWorks threat team to see if he was aware of the site, and he dismissed it as a place for “script kiddies”—a pejorative term for unskilled hackers.

This was a time when many cybersecurity pros were shifting their focus away from cybercrime to state-sponsored hacking operations, which were more sophisticated and getting a lot of attention. But Nixon likes to zig where others zag, and her colleague's dismissiveness fueled her interest in the forums. Two other SecureWorks colleagues shared that interest, and the three studied the forums during downtime on their shifts. They focused on trying to identify the people running DDoS booters. 

What Nixon loved about the forums was how accessible they were to a beginner like herself. Threat-intelligence teams require privileged access to a victim's network to investigate breaches. But Nixon could access everything she needed in the public forums, where the hackers seemed to think no one was watching. Because of this, they often made mistakes in operational security, or OPSEC—letting slip little biographical facts such as the city where they lived, a school they attended, or a place they used to work. These details revealed in their chats, combined with other information, could help expose the real identities behind their anonymous masks. 

“It was a shock to me that it was relatively easy to figure out who [they were],” she says. 

She wasn't bothered by the immature boasting and petty fights that dominated the forums. “A lot of people don't like to do this work of reading chat logs. I realize that this is a very uncommon thing. And maybe my brain is built a little weird that I'm willing to do this,” she says. “I have a special talent that I can wade through garbage and it doesn't bother me.” 

Nixon soon realized that not all the members were script kiddies. Some exhibited real ingenuity and “powerful” skills, she says, but because they were applying these to frivolous purposes—hijacking gamer accounts instead of draining bank accounts—researchers and law enforcement were ignoring them. Nixon began tracking them, suspecting that they would eventually direct their skills at more significant targets—an intuition that proved to be correct. And when they did, she had already amassed a wealth of information about them. 

She continued her DDoS research for two years until a turning point in 2013, when the cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs, who made a career tracking cybercriminals, got swatted. 

About a dozen people from the security community worked with Krebs to expose the perpetrator, and Nixon was invited to help. Krebs sent her pieces of the puzzle to investigate, and eventually the group identified the culprit (though it would take two years for him to be arrested). When she was invited to dinner with Krebs and the other investigators, she realized she'd found her people.

“It was an amazing moment for me,” she says. “I was like, wow, there's all these like-minded people that just want to help and are doing it just for the love of the game, basically.”

It was porn stars who provided Nixon with her next big research focus—one that underscored her skill at spotting Com actors and criminal trends in their nascent stages, before they emerged as major threats.

In 2018, someone was hijacking the social media accounts of certain adult-film stars and using those accounts to blast out crypto scams to their large follower bases. Nixon couldn't figure out how the hackers had hijacked the social media profiles, but she promised to help the actors regain access to their accounts if they agreed to show her the private messages the hackers had sent or received during the time they controlled them. These messages led her to a forum where members were talking about how they stole the accounts. The hackers had tricked some of these actors into disclosing the mobile phone numbers of others. Then they used a technique called SIM swapping to reset passwords for social media accounts belonging to those other stars, locking them out. 

In SIM swapping, fraudsters get a victim's phone number assigned to a SIM card and phone they control, so that calls and messages intended for the victim go to them instead. This includes one-time security codes that sites text to account holders to verify themselves when accessing their account or changing its password. In some of the cases involving the porn stars, the hackers had manipulated telecom workers into making the SIM swaps for what they thought were legitimate reasons, and in other cases they bribed the workers to make the change. The hackers were then able to alter the password on the actors' social media accounts, lock out the owners, and use the accounts to advertise their crypto scams. 

SIM swapping is a powerful technique that can be used to hijack and drain entire cryptocurrency and bank accounts, so Nixon was surprised to see the fraudsters using it for relatively unprofitable schemes. But SIM swapping had rarely been used for financial fraud at that point, and like the earlier hackers Nixon had seen on Hack Forums, the ones hijacking porn star accounts didn't seem to grasp the power of the technique they were using. Nixon suspected that this would change and SIM swapping would soon become a major problem, so she shifted her research focus accordingly. It didn't take long for the fraudsters to pivot as well.

Nixon's skill at looking ahead in this way has served her throughout her career. On multiple occasions a hacker or hacking group would catch her attention—for using a novel hacking approach in some minor operation, for example—and she'd begin tracking their online posts and chats in the belief that they'd eventually do something significant with that skill. 

They usually did. When they later grabbed headlines with a showy or impactful operation, these hackers would seem to others to have emerged from nowhere, sending researchers and law enforcement scrambling to understand who they were. But Nixon would already have a dossier compiled on them and, in some cases, had unmasked their real identity as well. Lizard Squad was an example of this. The group burst into the headlines in 2014 and 2015 with a series of high-profile DDoS campaigns, but Nixon and colleagues at the job where she worked at the time had already been watching its members as individuals for a while. So the FBI sought their assistance in identifying them.

“The thing about these young hackers is that they … keep going until they get arrested, but it takes years for them to get arrested,” she says. “So a huge aspect of my career is just sitting on this information that has not been actioned [yet].”

It was during the Lizard Squad years that Nixon began developing tools to scrape and record hacker communications online, though it would be years before she began using these concepts to scrape the Com chatrooms and forums. These channels held a wealth of data that might not seem useful during the nascent stage of a hacker's career but could prove critical later, when law enforcement got around to investigating them; yet the contents were always at risk of being deleted by Com members or getting taken down by law enforcement when it seized websites and chat channels.

Nixon's work is unique because she engages with the actors in chat spaces to draw out information from them that “would not be otherwise normally available.”

Over several years, she scraped and preserved whatever chatrooms she was investigating. But it wasn't until early 2020, when she joined Unit 221B, that she got the chance to scrape the Telegram and Discord channels of the Com. She pulled all of this data together into a searchable platform that other researchers and law enforcement could use. The company hired two former hackers to help build scraping tools and infrastructure for this work; the result is eWitness, a community-driven, invitation-­only platform. It was initially seeded only with data Nixon had collected after she arrived at Unit 221B, but has since been augmented with data that other users of the platform have scraped from Com social spaces as well, some of which doesn't exist in public forums anymore.

Brogan, of the FBI, says it's an incredibly valuable tool, made more so by Nixon's own contributions. Other security firms scrape online criminal spaces as well, but they seldom share the content with outsiders, and Brogan says Nixon's work is unique because she engages with the actors in chat spaces to draw out information from them that “would not be otherwise normally available.” 

The preservation project she started when she got to Unit 221B could not have been better timed, because it coincided with the pandemic, the surge in new Com membership, and the emergence of two disturbing Com offshoots, CVLT and 764. She was able to capture their chats as these groups first emerged; after law enforcement arrested leaders of the groups and took control of the servers where their chats were posted, this material went offline.

CVLT—pronounced “cult”—was reportedly founded around 2019 with a focus on sextortion and child sexual abuse material. 764 emerged from CVLT and was spearheaded by a 15-year-old in Texas named Bradley Cadenhead, who named it after the first digits of his zip code. Its focus was extremism and violence. 

In 2021, because of what she observed in these groups, Nixon turned her attention to sextortion among Com members.

The type of sextortion they engaged in has its roots in activity that began a decade ago as “fan signing.” Hackers would use the threat of doxxing to coerce someone, usually a young female, into writing the hacker's handle on a piece of paper. The hacker would use a photo of it as an avatar on his online accounts—a kind of trophy. Eventually some began blackmailing victims into writing the hacker's handle on their face, breasts, or genitals. With CVLT, this escalated even further; targets were blackmailed into carving a Com member's name into their skin or engaging in sexually explicit acts while recording or livestreaming themselves.

During the pandemic a surprising number of SIM swappers crossed into child sexual abuse material and sadistic sextortion, according to Nixon. She hates tracking this gruesome activity, but she saw an opportunity to exploit it for good. She had long been frustrated at how leniently judges treated financial fraudsters because of their crimes' seemingly nonviolent nature. But she saw a chance to get harsher sentences for them if she could tie them to their sextortion and began to focus on these crimes. 

At this point, Waifu still wasn't on her radar. But that was about to change.

Nixon landed in Waifu's crosshairs after he and fellow members of the Com were involved in a large hack involving AT&T customer call records in April 2024.

Waifu's group gained access to dozens of cloud accounts with Snowflake, a company that provides online data storage for customers. One of those customers had more than 50 billion call logs of AT&T wireless subscribers stored in its Snowflake account. 

They tried to re-extort the telecom, threatening on social media to leak the records. They tagged the FBI in the post. “It's like they were begging to be investigated,” says Nixon.

Among the subscriber records were call logs for FBI agents who were AT&T customers. Nixon and other researchers believe the hackers may have been able to identify the phone numbers of agents through other means. Then they may have used a reverse-lookup program to identify the owners of phone numbers that the agents called or that called them and found Nixon's number among them. This is when they began harassing her.

But then they got reckless. They allegedly extorted nearly $400,000 from AT&T in exchange for promising to delete the call records they'd stolen. Then they tried to re-extort the telecom, threatening on social media to leak the records they claimed to have deleted if it didn't pay more. They tagged the FBI in the post.

“It's like they were begging to be investigated,” says Nixon.

The Snowflake breaches and AT&T records theft were grabbing headlines at the time, but Nixon had no idea her number was in the stolen logs or that Waifu/Judische was a prime suspect in the breaches. So she was perplexed when he started taunting and threatening her online.

Over several weeks in May and June, a pattern developed. Waifu or one of his associates would post a threat against her and then post a message online inviting her to talk. She assumes now that they believed she was helping law enforcement investigate the Snowflake breaches and hoped to draw her into a dialogue to extract information from her about what authorities knew. But Nixon wasn't helping the FBI investigate them yet. It was only after she began looking at Waifu for the threats that she became aware of his suspected role in the Snowflake hack.

It wasn't the first time she had studied him, though. Waifu had come to her attention in 2019 when he bragged about framing another Com member for a hoax bomb threat and later talked about his involvement in SIM-swapping operations. He made an impression on her. He clearly had technical skills, but Nixon says he also often appeared immature, impulsive, and emotionally unstable, and he was desperate for attention in his interactions with other members. He bragged about not needing sleep and using Adderall to hack through the night. He was also a bit reckless about protecting personal details. He wrote in private chats to another researcher that he would never get caught because he was good at OPSEC, but he also told the researcher that he lived in Canada—which turned out to be true.

Nixon's process for unmasking Waifu followed a general recipe she used to unmask Com members: She'd draw a large investigative circle around a target and all the personas that communicated with that person online, and then study their interactions to narrow the circle to the people with the most significant connections to the target. Some of the best leads came from a target's enemies; she could glean a lot of information about their identity, personality, and activities from what the people they fought with online said about them.

“The enemies and the ex-girlfriends, generally speaking, are the best [for gathering intelligence on a suspect],” she says. “I love them.”

While she was doing this, Waifu and his group were reaching out to other security researchers, trying to glean information about Nixon and what she might be investigating. They also attempted to plant false clues with the researchers by dropping the names of other cybercriminals in Canada who could plausibly be Waifu. Nixon had never seen cybercriminals engage in counterintelligence tactics like this.

Amid this subterfuge and confusion, Nixon and another researcher working with her did a lot of consulting and cross-checking with other researchers about the clues they were gathering to ensure they had the right name before they gave it to the FBI.

By July she and the researcher were convinced they had their guy: Connor Riley Moucka, a 25-year-old high school dropout living with his grandfather in Ontario. On October 30, Royal Canadian Mounted Police converged on Moucka's home and arrested him.

According to an affidavit filed in Canadian court, a plainclothes Canadian police officer visited Moucka's house under some pretense on the afternoon of October 21, nine days before the arrest, to secretly capture a photo of him and compare it with an image US authorities had provided. The officer knocked and rang the bell; Moucka opened the door looking disheveled and told the visitor: “You woke me up, sir.” He told the officer his name was Alex; Moucka sometimes used the alias Alexander Antonin Moucka. Satisfied that the person who answered the door was the person the US was seeking, the officer left. Waifu's online rants against Nixon escalated at this point, as did his attempts at misdirection. She believes the visit to his door spooked him.

Nixon won't say exactly how they unmasked Moucka—only that he made a mistake.

“I don't want to train these people in how to not get caught [by revealing his error],” she says.

The Canadian affidavit against Moucka reveals a number of other violent posts he's alleged to have made online beyond the threats he made against her. Some involve musings about becoming a serial killer or mass-mailing sodium nitrate pills to Black people in Michigan and Ohio; in another, his online persona talks about obtaining firearms to “kill Canadians” and commit “suicide by cop.” 

Prosecutors, who list Moucka's online aliases as including Waifu, Judische, and two more in the indictment, say he and others extorted at least $2.5 million from at least three victims whose data they stole from Snowflake accounts. Moucka has been charged with nearly two dozen counts, including conspiracy, unauthorized access to computers, extortion, and wire fraud. He has pleaded not guilty and was extradited to the US last July. His trial is scheduled for October this year, though hacking cases usually end in plea agreements rather than going to trial. 

It took months for authorities to arrest Moucka after Nixon and her colleague shared their findings with the authorities, but an alleged associate of his in the Snowflake conspiracy, a US Army soldier named Cameron John Wagenius (Kiberphant0m online), was arrested more quickly. 

On November 10, 2024, Nixon and her team found a mistake Wagenius made that helped identify him, and on December 20 he was arrested. Wagenius has already pleaded guilty to two charges around the sale or attempted sale of confidential phone records and will be sentenced this March.

These days Nixon continues to investigate sextortion among Com members. But she says that remaining members of Waifu's group still taunt and threaten her.

“They are continuing to persist in their nonsense, and they are getting taken out one by one,” she says. “And I'm just going to keep doing that until there's no one left on that side.”

Podcaster David Greene is accusing Google of using his voice without permission to create one of the AI voices in the company's research and note-taking tool NotebookLM.

Google added Audio Overviews in the second half of 2024, allowing NotebookLM users to make brief podcast episodes out of pages of notes and documents of any kind. The AI-generated podcasts typically have one male and one female cohost. Greene is now claiming that the male co-host was clearly trained on hours of his hard work, which it allegedly now mimics, and he is suing the company for failing to get his permission or offering him any compensation.

“Without his consent, Google sought to replicate Mr. Greene's distinctive voice—a voice made iconic over decades of decorated radio and public commentary—to create synthetic audio products that mimic his delivery, cadence, and persona,” the complaint filed in a state trial court in Santa Clara County, California claims.

Greene was the co-host of NPR's award-winning Morning Edition podcast for roughly a decade, and now he hosts KCRW's Left, Right & Center podcast.

Following the release of the AI podcasting feature in 2024, the internet praised how the podcasters sounded more human than expected. At the time, Forbes called the feature “eerily human,” while WIRED said that the cadence and vocal performance of the virtual podcasters, and the use of filler words or peculiar phrasing, made the product “stand out.”

Google has called NotebookLM one of the company's “breakout AI successes.”  The lawsuit claims that the company “misappropriated a beloved public radio and podcast host's career, identity, and livelihood as raw material for a tech company's bottom line without any compensation.”

Greene was first alerted to the similarity by colleagues, and he then consulted an AI forensic firm to confirm his suspicions. According to the lawsuit, the tests indicated a 53-60% confidence that the voice was Greene's, with any confidence score above 50% deemed “relatively high.” The CEO of the unnamed forensic company eventually concluded that it was their “confident opinion that the Google Podcast model was trained on David Greene's voice,” per the lawsuit.

“These allegations are baseless,” Google spokesperson José Castañeda told Gizmodo. “The sound of the male voice in NotebookLM's Audio Overviews is based on a paid professional actor Google hired.”

The use of intellectual and artistic property has been a huge issue in AI, leading to several high-profile lawsuits aimed at AI industry giants like OpenAI and Google. Models need lots of data for training, but with limited regulatory guardrails, the lines blur when it comes to proper authorization by and compensation for those who have labored to create the stuff it trains on.

When it comes to mimicking likenesses, such as in voice or video generation, there is also the added uncanny experience of individuals having to surrender all autonomy over their own voice or image, as users can have the models do and say pretty much anything that they want. In a bit of high-profile fallout in 2024, Scarlett Johansson complained about OpenAI after the company allegedly used or replicated her voice to power a ChatGPT voice, even after the actress (who famously voiced an AI companion in the 2013 movie “Her”) declined the company's requests for her participation.

The tech world is a rich and complex global ecosystem. If a butterfly flaps its wings in your smartphone's operating system, that can potentially cause a hurricane for Tesla's sales, according to the the interpretation of events laid out in the latest column from Apple scoop guy Mark Gurman of Bloomberg.

Specifically, it seems that iPhone users' apparent resistance to iOS 26 led to CarPlay not being adopted by Tesla, which may have cost Tesla precious revenue at a time when it was sorely needed. (It's worth noting that while it was rumored that users were slow to adopt iOS 26 because they hated the gross new Liquid Glass aesthetic, the data on that are contradictory, although updates to iOS 26 really do appear to have lagged.)

Apple CarPlay, which brings up a familiar and easy-to-use representation of your iPhone screen on your car's infotainment system, is a make-or-break feature for some car buyers. You can find Reddit posts in which CarPlay fanatics lament the feature's absence in Teslas, and possibly let it dissuade them from buying the company's EVs at all.

According to Gurman's reporting from November, sales-starved Tesla noticed this complaint, and moved to correct the omission, possibly by the end of the year. Tesla apparently knew it was in trouble at the time, and Q4 sales numbers reflected that: they were down 16% from the previous fiscal quarter, and compared to 2024, deliveries were down by 9%.

According to Gurman's anonymous leakers in and around Apple, CarPlay was expected to run in a window within the Tesla proprietary infotainment system, and “CarPlay also won't tap into Tesla features like FSD, or full self-driving mode. Drivers will need to rely on Tesla's own navigation app for that,” according to Gurman.

If you've ever been in a Ford with Blue Cruise driver assistance and CarPlay running at the same time, you've had a taste of this complicated technological dance.

Apparently, harmonizing maps functions in CarPlay with Tesla's autonomous driving system wasn't going well when GPS guidance was running, resulting in “a confusing experience for users, who could theoretically have both applications open side by side,” according to Gurman.

So reportedly Tesla asked Apple to tweak its iOS, which they were willing to do in iOS 26, which should theoretically have paved the way for CarPlay to roll out in Tesla's. But that reportedly still hasn't happened, because Tesla was worried that all those theoretical iPhone users becoming first-time Tesla owners were going to try and sync them with still glitchy, un-patched iOS 25.

Gurman implies, but doesn't state outright, that recent reports of 74% adoption of iOS 26 on iPhones from the past four years represent some kind of possible watershed moment—as long as too many people don't still have iOS 26.0—the original version of iOS 26 that still didn't have the Tesla bug fix—on their phones.

So does that mean enough people have comparable software, and Tesla is about to finally ship support for CarPlay? Gurman specifies no such thing. Nonetheless, the update is still apparently in the works.

Power, rather than compute, is fast becoming the limiting factor in scaling AI data centers. That shift has prompted Peak XV Partners to back C2i Semiconductors, an Indian startup building plug-and-play, system-level power solutions designed to cut energy losses and improve the economics of large-scale AI infrastructure.

C2i (which stands for control conversion and intelligence) has raised $15 million in a Series A round led by Peak XV Partners, with participation from Yali Deeptech and TDK Ventures, bringing the two-year-old startup's total funding to $19 million.

The investment comes as data-center energy demand accelerates worldwide. Electricity consumption from data centers is projected to nearly triple by 2035, per a December 2025 report from BloombergNEF, while Goldman Sachs Research estimates data-center power demand could surge 175% by 2030 from 2023 levels — the equivalent of adding another top-10 power-consuming country.

Much of that strain comes not from generating electricity but from converting it efficiently inside data centers, where high-voltage power must be stepped down thousands of times before it reaches GPUs. This process currently wastes about 15% to 20% of energy, C2i's co-founder and CTO Preetam Tadeparthy said in an interview.

“What used to be 400 volts has already moved to 800 volts, and will likely go higher,” Tadeparthy told TechCrunch.

Founded in 2024 by former Texas Instruments power executives Ram Anant, Vikram Gakhar, Preetam Tadeparthy, and Dattatreya Suryanarayana, along with Harsha S. B and Muthusubramanian N. V, C2i is redesigning power delivery as a single, plug-and-play “grid-to-GPU” system spanning the data-center bus to the processor itself.

By treating power conversion, control and packaging as an integrated platform, C2i estimates it can cut end-to-end losses by around 10% — roughly 100 kilowatts saved for every megawatt consumed — with knock-on effects for cooling costs, GPU utilisation and overall data-center economics.

“All that translates directly to total cost of ownership, revenue, and profitability,” Tadeparthy said.

For Peak XV Partners (which split from Sequoia Capital in 2023), the attraction lies in how power costs shape the economics of AI infrastructure at scale. Rajan Anandan, the venture firm's managing director, told TechCrunch that after the upfront capital investment in servers and facilities, energy costs become the dominant ongoing expense for data centers, making even incremental efficiency gains highly valuable.

“If you can reduce energy costs by, call it, 10 to 30%, that's like a huge number,” Anandan said. “You're talking about tens of billions of dollars.”

The claims will be tested quickly. C2i expects its first two silicon designs to return from fabrication between April and June, after which the startup plans to validate performance with data-center operators and hyperscalers that have asked to review the data, according to Tadeparthy.

The Bengaluru-based startup has built a team of about 65 engineers and is setting up customer-facing operations in the U.S. and Taiwan as it prepares for early deployments.

Power delivery is one of the most entrenched parts of the data-center stack, long dominated by large incumbents with deep balance sheets and years-long qualification cycles. While many newer companies focus on improving individual components, redesigning power delivery end-to-end requires coordinating silicon, packaging, and system architecture simultaneously — a capital-intensive approach that few startups attempt and one that can take years to prove in production environments.

Anandan said the real question now is execution, noting that all startups face technology, market, and team risks when betting on how industries evolve. In C2i's case, he said, the feedback loop should be relatively short. “We'll know in the next six months,” said Anandan, pointing to upcoming silicon and early customer validation as the moment when the thesis will be tested.

The bet also reflects how India's semiconductor design ecosystem has matured in recent years.

“The way you should look at semiconductors in India is, this is like 2008 e-commerce,” said Anandan. “It's just getting started.”

He pointed to the depth of engineering talent — with a growing share of global chip designers based in the country — alongside government-backed design-linked incentives that have lowered the cost and risk of tape-outs, making it increasingly viable for startups to build globally competitive semiconductor products from India rather than operate only as captive design centers.

Whether those conditions translate into a globally competitive product will become clearer over the coming months, as C2i begins validating its system-level power solutions with customers.

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Early detection of pulmonary nodules is crucial for timely diagnosis and effective treatment. Conventional computer-aided detection systems have shown limitations, including high false-positive rates and low sensitivity. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown great potential in improving the accuracy and reliability of nodule detection and classification. This study aimed to develop and evaluate an automatic method for lung nodule detection and classification using a CNN-based architecture applied to computed tomography images from the publicly available LIDC-IDRI database.

This retrospective study was conducted on 82 patients (10,496 computed tomography slices) selected from the LIDC-IDRI database. The proposed method consists of five main steps: image preprocessing, lung parenchyma segmentation using Otsu's thresholding and morphological operations, detection of nodule candidates, feature extraction, and classification using a CNN model. The CNN architecture includes two convolutional layers (20 and 30 filters, 3×3 kernel), ReLU activation, max-pooling layers, and a Softmax output layer. The network was trained with a mini-batch size of 32 for 50 epochs using the Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum optimizer (learning rate = 0.001, momentum = 0.9). Model performance was evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy.

The proposed CNN model successfully detected pulmonary nodules and achieved accurate classification between benign and malignant nodules. On the LIDC-IDRI dataset, the model achieved a sensitivity of 98.7%, specificity of 97.5%, precision of 97.9%, and accuracy of 98.4%. Comparative analysis with recent studies, including hybrid CNN-long short-term memory and ResNet-based models, demonstrated that the proposed method provides competitive performance while maintaining lower computational complexity. The classification of nodule subtypes (solid, partially frosted, totally frosted) showed satisfactory discrimination results.

The proposed CNN-based system demonstrates the feasibility and robustness of deep learning for automatic lung nodule detection and classification. Despite strong results, the study acknowledges limitations such as single-database validation and a relatively small training size. Future work will focus on validating the model across other datasets (e.g., ELCAP, NELSON) and optimizing multi-class classification performance to enhance generalizability and clinical applicability.

A small team at OVACell is fighting ovarian cancer with hidden viral sequences and advanced immunotherapies.

The initiative highlights successful stories from projects funded by the European Innovation Council (EIC). Featured in DeepSync, part of the EIC Communities project, these stories offer a unique opportunity to connect with fellow members and innovators. By showcasing the challenges and successes of each project's journey, these stories present key moments and insights that can raise visibility, foster deeper understanding, and encourage collective knowledge exchange across communities.A small team at ErVimmune, the company leading the European OVACell project, is pioneering innovative therapies for one of the deadliest cancers affecting women. Ovarian cancer often goes undetected until late stages, leaving patients with limited treatment options. OVACell aims to change that, using T cell therapies that target unconventional antigens derived from human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), viral sequences normally dormant in human DNA but abnormally expressed in tumour cells."Every decision, experiment, and partnership we make is guided by the reality faced by patients," says Nathalie Donne, CEO of ErVimmune. "We're not just working on cells in a lab; we're working to improve real people's lives."Founded in 2020 by Professor Stéphane Depil, a physician and academic oncologist, ErVimmune combines scientific expertise with patient-focused insight. Professor Depil's regular interactions with patients show the urgent need for therapies that truly make a difference. "Stéphane keeps us focused on impact, not just novelty," says Nathalie.OVACell's approach is both innovative and highly precise. The project first developed a vaccine for triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer, targeting sequences shared across a wide patient population in Europe, North America, and ASEAN regions. Building on this success, OVACell is now advancing a T cell therapy for ovarian cancer, a disease with very high unmet medical need, where relapse is common and late diagnosis drastically reduces survival rates.Each therapy is carefully validated to avoid harming healthy tissue. OVACell uses a proprietary methodology including algorithms with AI-driven data analysis, immunopeptidomics, and in vitro testing to ensure the highest specificity and safety.Collaboration has been essential for progress. ErVimmune works with contract manufacturers in France to scale production, as well as regulatory and clinical partners to navigate complex safety and efficacy requirements. "We are a small team," says Natalie. "To achieve what we do, we rely on expertise and strong partnerships, sharing both vision and value."Challenges remain, including technical adjustments, regulatory hurdles, and financing. Yet the team's resilience and determination have driven significant milestones, from product development to early preclinical validation.For ErVimmune' team, the project is also close to home. "We all have friends and loved ones affected by cancer. Every solution we develop, every step we take, could make a difference. Prevention, awareness and innovation are not abstract; they save lives."With the support of the European Innovation Council, OVACell is now preparing for preclinical evaluation, with the goal of demonstrating safety and efficacy in humans in the coming years. The project exemplifies how a small, committed team can address one of medicine's toughest challenges, combining cutting-edge science, careful validation and a human-first mission.OVACell's journey reminds the world that medical innovation is about more than technology; it is about empathy, courage, and the determination to give patients a real chance at life.

Late in the COVID-19 pandemic, mortality rates were elevated for Medicare beneficiaries with cardiovascular risk factors or established cardiovascular disease compared with the prepandemic period. Hospital visit rates were also lower and use of outpatient visits were higher during this period, according to study results. 

“Patients with cardiovascular disease are very vulnerable to both the acute and long-term effects of COVID — on their bodies and on the health system that cares for them,” study researcher Karen Joynt Maddox, MD, MPH, told Medscape Medical News.

Despite the first waves of COVID causing immense morbidity and mortality and healthcare avoidance for older adults, little is known about what happened on a population level as the pandemic dragged on, said Joynt Maddox, who is a cardiologist at WashU Medicine in St Louis, Missouri. 

“Did people return to their pre-COVID habits in seeking care?” she said. “Did COVID cause higher mortality, or was there a ‘healthy survivor' effect as many had predicted, where peaks in mortality would be offset later by lower mortality rates? There were just a lot of remaining unknowns about the downstream consequences of the pandemic.”

These unknowns led Joynt Maddox, Rishi K. Wadhera, MD, MPP, MPhil, of Harvard Medical School in Boston, and colleagues to conduct the study. Their analysis involved all Medicare fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries with cardiovascular risk factors or established cardiovascular disease from January 2018 to December 2022. Risk factors included hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Cardiovascular disease included coronary heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke.

In all, the study featured about 51.4 million beneficiaries in the prepandemic period (ie, January 2018 to December 2019) and about 55.2 million beneficiaries in the late pandemic period (ie, January 2021 to July 2022). 

Data showed that hospital visit rates dropped in the late pandemic period compared with the prepandemic period (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR], 0.918; 95% CI, 0.915-0.922). These declines were apparent for rural and urban beneficiaries, across all levels of social vulnerability, and in both fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, the researchers wrote. 

Conversely, use of outpatient visits during the late pandemic period rose (aIRR, 1.141; 95% CI, 1.134-1.149). Increases were higher on average among urban communities and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries.

The researchers also found that all-cause mortality was elevated during the late pandemic period (aIRR, 1.248; 95% CI, 1.240-1.257), and that these mortality surges tracked with national COVID-19 mortality. The greatest increase in all-cause mortality was observed among beneficiaries in the most socially vulnerable communities (aIRR, 1.116; 95% CI, 1.106-1.124) and those covered by Medicare Advantage (aIRR, 1.342; 95% CI, 1.329-1.356).

For Clyde W. Yancy, MD, MSc, chief of the Division of Cardiology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, the 25% rise in mortality represents the most worrisome issue. 

“With more than 1 million aggregate deaths due to COVID-19, this calculus may simply reflect the overall burden of mortality during the pandemic,” Yancy told Medscape Medical News. “Yet if any of this risk was attributable to structural challenges accessing healthcare, we are forewarned to anticipate this yet again.”

Although Joynt Maddox noted that she and fellow researchers do not know the exact reason behind these patterns, she believes there are at least three contributing factors: biology, behavior, and system strain. 

“The mortality that we see in the data matches up with COVID spikes more broadly; that tells me that the virus is triggering cardiovascular events in addition to causing respiratory problems,” Joynt Maddox said. “We kind of knew that from flu, but this raises lots of interesting questions about the impact of viruses on inflammation and cardiovascular disease.”

Regarding behavior, she said some people avoided healthcare in the early days of COVID, and emergency department and hospital utilization didn't fully rebound, which could have had negative consequences.

“Finally, there have been real changes to the healthcare system,” Joynt Maddox said. “Hospitals have closed; nursing homes have closed; and primary care continues to be under immense strain. 

“It's impossible to say which of these drove the results (probably all did), but it does suggest a few places where we need a deeper dive.”

Joynt Maddox has received research support from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institute of Nursing Research, National Institute on Aging, and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences; has served as an Associate Editor for JAMA; has served on the Health Policy Advisory Council for the Centene Corporation (St Louis, Missouri); and has received research funding from Humana. Yancy reported no relevant financial relationships.

More than 120 peer-reviewed cell types have already been successfully cryopreserved using Bambanker™, all consolidated in one place for easy access and reference.

Cryopreservation is central to how most labs manage their cell workflows today. By pairing a cryoprotectant with controlled cooling and ultra-low-temperature storage, researchers can effectively pause cellular activity while maintaining important phenotypes so experiments can be resumed later with confidence and continuity.

With increasing pressure to improve study reproducibility and a growing need to store and share well-characterized cells (from standard cell lines to more advanced programs), many researchers are making standardized, publication-supported freezing conditions a priority. To make that evidence easy to verify, a DOI-linked overview brings together cell types reported in peer-reviewed studies as cryopreserved with Bambanker™.

Because these variables can vary from one lab to another, and even between closely related cell types, having published examples to refer to makes a real difference. They offer a practical starting point, help reduce uncertainty, and give you a clearer sense of what has already worked under comparable conditions.

The DOI-linked article below brings together peer-reviewed reports of cell types cryopreserved with Bambanker™, so you can quickly find relevant references and see how others have approached similar workflows.

Bambanker™ is a ready-to-use cryoprotectant designed to streamline mammalian cell freezing by:

Its performance has been documented in over 120 peer-reviewed publications, spanning a diverse range of cell and sample types.

Announcing a new article publication for BIO Integration journal. In recent years, phytochemicals and medicinal plants have increasingly been used to treat autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA, a systemic inflammatory disease, is a chronic condition that affects primarily the joints, which are lined by synovial membranes, and leads to pain, diminished mobility, and joint deterioration.

Oxidative stress, synovial hyperplasia, immune cell infiltration, and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6, are key factors in RA development. Herbal medicine is an effective alternative to conventional treatments, such as biologics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, which are commonly used but can lose effectiveness or cause adverse effects. Phytotherapy therefore provides a promising complementary approach.

This review provides an in-depth analysis of the pathophysiology of RA, therapeutic targets, drug resistance, and current therapeutic boundaries, with a focus on the roles of phytochemicals such as lignans, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and phenolic compounds.

By targeting key pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6, and reformed molecular pathways such as those involving NF-κB, MAPK, and Nrf2/HO-1, these phytochemicals have potent anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatoid arthritis properties.

Healthcare systems worldwide are increasingly recognizing the importance of environmental sustainability, yet little is known about how healthcare professionals perceive and implement sustainable practices in Kazakhstan. A new qualitative study explores the perspectives of Kazakhstani healthcare practitioners on environmental sustainability in healthcare and highlights key opportunities and challenges for building greener health systems.

Environmental sustainability has become a critical priority for healthcare organizations aiming to reduce their ecological footprint while maintaining high standards of patient care. Understanding the views of frontline healthcare professionals is essential for designing effective and realistic sustainability policies.

The study aimed to explore the perspectives of healthcare professionals in Kazakhstan regarding environmental sustainability in healthcare settings.

Researchers employed an exploratory qualitative design. Four focus group discussions were conducted between June and August 2023 in three cities of Kazakhstan. Participants included nurses, physicians, midwives, and physical therapists. Each group consisted of 6-11 participants and sessions lasted 60-90 minutes. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.

The analysis identified 137 initial codes, which were grouped into 22 sub-themes and five overarching themes:

Environmental sustainability practices in healthcare

Purposes of environmental sustainability in healthcare

Impact of sustainability practices on patients

Challenges in implementing sustainability initiatives

Role of healthcare leadership in promoting sustainability

Participants emphasized that sustainable practices can improve patient outcomes and organizational efficiency but noted barriers such as limited resources, lack of awareness, and insufficient institutional support. Strong leadership emerged as a critical factor in successfully implementing green policies.

The findings provide important insights into how healthcare professionals perceive sustainability efforts and underline the need for strategic leadership and organizational commitment. Strengthening awareness, resources, and policy support will be essential for advancing environmentally responsible healthcare in Kazakhstan.

The study offers valuable evidence for policymakers and healthcare leaders seeking to develop sustainable healthcare systems. Integrating environmental sustainability into routine practice can support both environmental protection and improved patient care.

There was no patient or public contribution to this study.

The study followed EQUATOR guidelines, specifically the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ).

In a small case series, investigators used molecular diagnostic techniques to help identify an activating EGFR variant in patients with a novel acanthosis nigricans (AN) syndrome that responded to EGFR-targeting therapies. Resolution of these patients' skin manifestations and accompanying lung nodule reductions suggested that early identification and treatment of such patients is critical to prevent malignant transformation, according to the authors.

Researchers including co-senior author Keith A. Choate, MD, PhD, enrolled two unrelated patients who presented with severe syndromic AN marked by early-onset generalized keratoderma accentuated at flexural sites, woolly hair, palmoplantar keratoderma, and lung nodules, all in the context of normoglycemia. Choate is Aaron B. and Marguerite Lerner Professor and Chair of Dermatology and professor of genetics and pathology at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. The paper was recently published in JAMA Dermatology.

“In this study,” Choate told Medscape Medical News, “we observed patients who had a much more generalized, widespread form of keratoderma that was similar to, but much more dramatic than, classical [AN].” Along with global skin thickening, he explained, these patients — both boys, ages 16 and 8 (patients 1 and 2) — had facial skin laxity, changes in hair texture and morphology, and pulmonary nodules.

Whole-exome sequencing of genomic DNA extracted from these patients' saliva and blood samples vs those of their unaffected parents revealed that the boys possessed heterozygous de novo gain-of-function mutations in EGFR; specifically, the same L858R mutation that has been observed in lung cancer. Investigators also found the same mutation in a 17-year-old girl (patient 3) with hyperpigmented linear verrucous plaques on the forehead and left leg who had been diagnosed with widespread epidermal nevus. In her case, the variation appeared only in lesional keratinocytes.

Low-dose chest CT scans of the male patients revealed that both had numerous bilateral ground-glass and solid pulmonary nodules. In patient 1, lung nodule biopsy showed multifocal atypical pneumocyte proliferation consistent with atypical adenomatous hyperplasia. Additionally, next-generation sequencing of tumor tissue detected somatic gene variants including EGFR p.V834L, a second-site mutation which investigators interpreted as a possible precancerous state.

Regarding EGFR activation, immunofluorescence staining of patient 2's affected skin revealed elevated levels of the downstream EGFR pathway effector phosphorylated RPS6 vs control. Similarly, immunoblotting analyses of lysates from in vitro-differentiated primary keratinocytes from patients 1 and 3 reflected elevated phosphorylation of EGFR, Akt, and ERK1/2.

Turning off the EGFR mutation with targeted therapy using EGFR inhibitors provided substantial improvement for both the male patients. Investigators gave patient 1 osimertinib (Tagrisso), 40 mg daily, after 2 weeks at 20 mg daily. Patient 2 received erlotinib, 3 mg/kg daily. Within 1 month, both patients experienced remission of hypohidrosis, normalization of hyperkeratotic skin, and substantial reduction in hyperpigmentation and palmoplantar keratoderma. Moreover, these patients' hair became straighter, although not denser. By week 16, patients 1 and 2 achieved complete skin disease remission, persistent through 12 and 6 months, respectively.

As for pulmonary manifestations, serial chest CT scans revealed reductions in the nodule size and number for both patients. At 5 months, for example, patient 1 experienced 72.9% shrinkage in a left lower lobe nodule, with no further changes thereafter.

For patient 3, investigators chose topical trametinib because their previous research showed that most epidermal nevi stemmed from activating RAS mutations, which activate the MEK pathway. However, this treatment only slightly flattened the patient's facial lesions. Ultimately, Choate reported, topical erlotinib gave the patient much better results.

The study's most important lesson, Choate told Medscape Medical News, is that clinicians who see a generalized AN-like phenotype presenting at an early age without classical AN drivers such as metabolic disease should consider that syndromic AN carries potentially significant comorbidity up to and including cancer.

“There are likely patients like this out there in the population who are being seen in routine dermatology practice,” he said. “So it's very important to consider the possibility that patients who present with this constellation of findings — generalized early skin thickening and changes in hair texture and facial features — as potentially having a syndromic disorder that could be very effectively treated by using targeted therapy,” or potentially lethal if untreated.

The case series, moreover, emphasizes that when dermatologists see a patient with signs of a genetic disorder such as the present one, he said, “it's important to get all the way to certainty about what's driving it. This is why we need to be more broadly employing genetic testing in routine dermatology practice.”

For internists, he added, the publication provides an opportunity to recognize the contributions dermatologists can make to diagnosis and therapy. Because patient 1 also presented with impaired exercise tolerance, Choate explained, “it was the combined efforts of a team that included pulmonology, oncology, and dermatology that ultimately decided to initiate therapy. It takes care coordination across specialties to manage and treat syndromic disorders.”

The study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health and the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Choate reported being an investigator for AbbVie, Janssen, BioCryst, and Regeneron and a scientific advisor for ResVita Bio.

HER2-positive gastric cancer accounts for a substantial proportion of advanced cases and has long been treated with HER2-targeted therapies. While trastuzumab deruxtecan has shown superior activity compared with earlier agents, most patients either fail to respond initially or eventually develop resistance. Tumor heterogeneity, metabolic adaptation, and changes in the tumor microenvironment are believed to play critical roles, yet these processes remain poorly understood in clinical samples. Traditional bulk analyses obscure rare but influential cell populations that may drive resistance. In light of these challenges, a deeper investigation into treatment-induced cellular evolution and resistance mechanisms at single-cell resolution is urgently needed.

Researchers from Peking University Cancer Hospital and collaborating institutions report new insights into drug resistance in advanced gastric cancer in a study published (DOI: 10.1093/pcmedi/pbaf038) on 19 December 2025 in Precision Clinical Medicine. Analyzing tumor biopsies from patients enrolled in the phase II DESTINY-Gastric06 trial, the team applied single-cell RNA sequencing to track how cancer cells and their surrounding immune environment evolve during treatment with trastuzumab deruxtecan. The work identifies molecular drivers of both primary and acquired resistance and highlights potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets to improve patient outcomes.

The researchers profiled nearly 92,000 individual cells from gastric cancer biopsies collected before treatment, during response, and after resistance emerged. By dissecting epithelial tumor cells at single-cell resolution, they identified distinct transcriptional programs linked to different resistance stages. Tumors showing primary resistance were enriched for metabolic pathways associated with glycolysis and lipid metabolism. Among these, MUC3A stood out as a key marker: high expression predicted shorter progression-free survival and experimentally reduced sensitivity to trastuzumab deruxtecan by limiting drug binding to HER2-positive cells.

In contrast, acquired resistance followed a different trajectory. As treatment progressed, tumor cells downregulated HER2 and cell-cycle genes while upregulating CST3, a natural inhibitor of lysosomal proteases required to cleave the drug's linker and release its cytotoxic payload. Functional assays confirmed that CST3 dampens drug activation, allowing tumor cells to survive despite continued therapy.

Beyond tumor-intrinsic changes, the study revealed dynamic remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. Initial treatment enhanced immune-cell infiltration and antigen presentation, but resistant tumors shifted toward an immunosuppressive state marked by reactivation of transforming growth factor-beta signaling and increased PD-1 expression on immune cells. Together, these findings show that resistance emerges through coordinated cellular, metabolic, and immune adaptations.

"Resistance to highly effective therapies is rarely driven by a single factor," said one of the senior investigators. "By examining tumors at single-cell resolution, we were able to see how different cancer cell populations adapt in distinct ways—some blocking drug binding early on, others disabling drug activation or reshaping the immune environment over time. This layered view of resistance helps explain why responses can be short-lived and underscores the importance of dynamic biomarkers when treating advanced gastric cancer."

The findings suggest several clinical strategies to improve outcomes for patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer. Measuring MUC3A expression could help identify patients unlikely to benefit from trastuzumab deruxtecan upfront, enabling more precise treatment selection. Targeting CST3 or restoring lysosomal drug processing may help overcome acquired resistance. In parallel, the observed shift toward immune suppression supports combining trastuzumab deruxtecan with immunotherapies or agents targeting TGF-β signaling. More broadly, the study demonstrates how single-cell technologies can guide personalized combination therapies by revealing when and how tumors adapt under therapeutic pressure.

Physical therapy is a key step on the path to recovery after injuries or certain surgical procedures. A new survey by The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center shows 3 out of 4 (76%) patients don't complete their physical therapy homework, leading to stalled recoveries and potential surgical setbacks.

The one to three hours per week a patient spends in physical therapy pales in comparison to the 168 hours we have in a given week. And that one to three hours patients are physically in the clinic is not enough to make big changes in the grand scheme of things."

Kyle Smith, PT, physical therapist, Ohio State Medical Center

Smith and his team of physical therapists at Ohio State work with patients to advance or adjust their at-home physical therapy assignments based on feedback or any barriers the patient may face. Smith will suggest simple changes patients can make to their daily routines like parking farther away at work or the grocery store, balancing on one leg while brushing your teeth, or doing stretches or squats during television shows.

"As physical therapists, we need to educate patients that it is going to take some work on their end to reach the goals they have to ultimately build strength and mobility and decrease the body's pain sensitivity," said Smith.

Survey results:
The recent survey commissioned by Ohio State asked 1,006 Americans what share of their assigned at-home physical therapy (PT) sessions they completed. One-quarter (24%) of respondents completed all of their assigned homework, while a similar amount (28%) completed 75-99% of their sessions and another group (27%) completed 50-74% of their at-home PT. Only 1 in 10 (11%) completed 25-49% of their exercises, and even fewer (8%) completed 1-25%. There were very few (2%) who said they didn't complete any of their at-home PT.

The survey shows adults 65 and older are more likely than those under 30 to complete all at-home assigned PT exercises (30% of those 65 and older versus 12% of those under 30). Similarly, this older group of Americans is also much less likely than their younger counterparts to complete only 1-25% of their at-home sessions (5% of those 65 and older versus 15% of those under 30).

The survey also asked about the reasons why respondents did not complete their at-home PT assignments. Four out of 10 (40%) people didn't complete all their sessions because they forgot/had no reminders, which was the most common reason indicated. In addition, one-third (33%) said it was because they didn't have enough time or had schedule conflicts.

Survey respondents' reasons for not completing at-home PT assignments:

I forgot/no reminders (40%

Not enough time/schedule conflicts (33%)

Boring/repetitive (22%)

Didn't see results quickly (19%)

Pain or fear of making it worse (18%)

No accountability between visits (15%)

Didn't have the right space/equipment at home (13%)

Didn't think they were necessary (12%)

Didn't fully understand the instructions (5%)

Other (4%)

None of the above (2%)

Survey methodology:
This study was conducted by SSRS on its Opinion Panel Omnibus platform. The SSRS Opinion Panel Omnibus is a national, twice-per-month, probability-based survey. Data collection was conducted from September 18 – September 21, 2025, among a sample of 1,006 respondents. The survey was conducted via web (n=976) and telephone (n=30) and administered in English. The margin of error for total respondents is +/-3.7 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. All SSRS Opinion Panel Omnibus data are weighted to represent the target population of U.S. adults ages 18 or older.

An international study led by researchers from the Sant Pau Research Institute (IR Sant Pau) shows that advanced use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows much more accurate identification of patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). These are two rare and clearly underdiagnosed atypical parkinsonian disorders.

The study, published in The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease, shows that this strategy improves early diagnosis and transforms the design of clinical trials, making them more precise and feasible for diseases for which no disease-modifying treatment currently exists.

"These are diseases that cause balance problems, falls, stiffness, or difficulties with speech and movement. Many patients initially present as if they had Parkinson's disease or are simply older adults with mobility difficulties," explains Dr. Jesús García-Castro, researcher in the Neurobiology of Dementias Group at IR Sant Pau and neurologist at Hospital de Sant Pau. He is the first author of the study. "This means they are greatly underdiagnosed, and for years we have not known with enough certainty which disease each patient actually had."

PSP and CBD belong to a group of neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies, which are characterized by the abnormal accumulation in the brain of tau protein, a protein essential for normal neuronal function.

When tau is deposited pathologically, it causes progressive damage to different brain regions. In PSP and CBD, this damage particularly affects areas involved in movement control, balance, posture, speech, and certain cognitive functions, which explains why their initial symptoms closely resemble those of Parkinson's disease.

Unlike Alzheimer's disease-another well-known tauopathy-PSP and CBD belong to the subgroup of four-repeat tauopathies, with their own distinct biological characteristics. However, for years these differences could not be clearly identified during life, leading to imprecise diagnoses and significant clinical confusion.

These diseases are, in a way, halfway between Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. They resemble Parkinson's because of their motor symptoms, but they share with Alzheimer's the fact that they are caused by tau pathology. The problem is that, until now, we did not have reliable tools to distinguish them properly."

Dr. Ignacio Illán-Gala, researcher in the Neurobiology of Dementias Group at IR Sant Pau and neurologist at Hospital de Sant Pau, and senior author of the study

For years, the lack of objective diagnostic tools has been one of the main obstacles to treatment development in these tauopathies. Patient selection for clinical trials has relied almost exclusively on clinical criteria, especially in early stages, when symptoms are still nonspecific and overlap across different diseases.

The same clinical syndrome can correspond to different underlying pathologies, and the same disease can manifest in very different ways. This heterogeneity has led many clinical trials to include biologically mixed populations, drastically reducing their ability to detect true therapeutic benefits.

This issue is particularly relevant in CBD, where a significant proportion of patients in fact have Alzheimer's disease. Without adequate biological filtering, the cohorts used in clinical trials are biologically contaminated, critically limiting their usefulness.

The study indicates that structural magnetic resonance imaging can address a long-standing gap in these tauopathies: the absence of reliable in vivo biomarkers capable of identifying the true underlying pathology when symptoms are still nonspecific.

By analyzing patterns of brain atrophy in detail, the researchers developed models capable of estimating with high probability whether a patient has PSP or CBD, even at very early stages of the disease. "MRI has two fundamental functions," explains Dr. García-Castro. "On the one hand, it helps us diagnose much more reliably at early stages. On the other hand, it allows us to measure disease progression objectively."

The key to the study lies in identifying disease-specific MRI signatures based on the combination of structural changes across different brain regions. In PSP, the signature is characterized mainly by involvement of deep brain structures, particularly the brainstem, together with more selective changes in certain cortical areas. In CBD, the pattern is different and shows more marked involvement of cortical regions, especially those related to motor control and sensory integration.

"Although they may look very similar clinically, at the brain level PSP and CBD damage the brain in different ways," says Dr. Illán-Gala. "These differences are reflected on MRI, and by combining them into a signature, we can much better determine which disease each patient has."

Beyond improving diagnostic accuracy, the study proves that MRI can also be used as a longitudinal follow-up tool in clinical trials targeting these tauopathies. By using disease-specific MRI signatures as objective measures of disease progression, the researchers demonstrate that it is possible to detect structural brain changes with much greater sensitivity than with traditional clinical scales.

In classic trial designs based on clinical variables-such as functional or symptom severity scales-demonstrating that a treatment modifies disease progression usually requires long follow-up periods and considerable sample sizes, often reaching several hundred patients. This approach is especially problematic in rare diseases such as PSP and CBD, where recruitment is slow, costly, and difficult to sustain over time.

Analyses performed in the study show that using MRI as an outcome measure substantially changes this scenario. In PSP, applying disease-specific MRI signatures could reduce the number of participants required by approximately 50% in a 12-month clinical trial compared with designs based solely on clinical scales. In CBD, where clinical and diagnostic heterogeneity is even greater, the impact is even more pronounced: use of these objective measures could lead to an approximately 80–85% reduction in the required sample size to detect a therapeutic effect with the same statistical power.

"For a company or an academic consortium to commit to a clinical trial, it has to be feasible," adds Dr. Illán-Gala. "If a trial requires a thousand patients, it is practically impossible. But if it can be conducted with a reasonable number of well-selected individuals and objective measures of progression, then there is a real chance of demonstrating whether a treatment works."

In this context, the researchers emphasize that these are not merely rare diseases but conditions that are both infrequent and clearly underdiagnosed. Methodological limitations have so far been a key barrier to therapeutic development and to the availability of real options for patients.

This line of research has direct continuity in projects currently underway at IR Sant Pau. In the 2025 call of the PERIS program of the Department of Health of the Government of Catalonia, the center received funding to advance the early diagnosis of four-repeat tauopathies, including PSP and CBD. This is done through the combination of plasma biomarkers and advanced imaging techniques.

This project, led by Dr. Illán-Gala, builds directly on the results now published and aims to shift diagnosis toward minimally symptomatic stages, when future disease-modifying treatments are more likely to be effective.

"Our goal is to reach a situation similar to that of Alzheimer's disease, where a combination of a blood test and an MRI scan allows these diseases to be diagnosed at very early stages and with much greater confidence," explains Dr. García-Castro.

"These conditions are far more common than we think, but we do not know how to detect them properly," concludes Dr. García-Castro. "Improving diagnosis is the first step so that these patients, who currently have no therapeutic options, can begin to have them."

Intermittent fasting is unlikely to lead to greater weight loss in overweight or obese adults than traditional dietary advice or doing nothing, a new Cochrane review finds.

Obesity is a significant public health problem that has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries. Worldwide adult obesity has more than tripled since 1975, according to the WHO. In 2022, 2.5 billion adults were overweight. Of these, 890 million were living with obesity.

Intermittent fasting has surged in popularity in recent years, fuelled by social media, lifestyle influencers, and claims of rapid weight loss and metabolic benefits.

Researchers analyzed evidence from 22 randomized clinical trials involving 1,995 adults across North America, Europe, China, Australia, and South America. Trials examined multiple forms of intermittent fasting, including alternate-day fasting, periodic fasting, and time-restricted feeding. Most studies followed participants for up to 12 months.

The review compared intermittent fasting with traditional dietary advice and with no intervention. Intermittent fasting did not appear to have a clinically meaningful effect on weight loss compared to standard dietary advice or doing nothing.

Reporting of side effects was inconsistent across trials, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. The evidence base remains limited, with only 22 trials, many with small sample sizes and inconsistent reporting.

Intermittent fasting just doesn't seem to work for overweight or obese adults trying to lose weight."

Luis Garegnani, lead author of the review, Universidad Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires Cochrane Associate Centre

Garegnani also cautioned against the hype surrounding fasting online. "Intermittent fasting may be a reasonable option for some people, but the current evidence doesn't justify the enthusiasm we see on social media."

Few trials have looked at the long-term results of intermittent fasting. "Obesity is a chronic condition. Short-term trials make it difficult to guide long-term decision-making for patients and clinicians," Garegnani added.

The majority of the included studies enrolled predominantly white populations in high-income countries. As obesity is a rapidly growing crisis in low- and middle-income countries, further research is needed in these populations.

The authors therefore warn that these results may provide clues, but cannot be extrapolated to the entire population, as they may vary depending on sex, age, ethnic origin, disease status, or underlying eating disorders or behaviours.

"With the current evidence available, it's hard to make a general recommendation," said Eva Madrid, senior author from Cochrane Evidence Synthesis Unit Iberoamerica. "Doctors will need to take a case-by-case approach when advising an overweight adult on losing weight."

A new study has identified an association between consumption of drinks containing a high amount of sugar and anxiety symptoms in adolescents. 

Researchers at Bournemouth University were part of a team involved in reviewing the findings of multiple studies that have investigated people's diets and their mental health, to establish common findings. 

Their results have been published in the Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics.

"With increasing concern about adolescent nutrition, most public health initiatives have emphasised the physical consequences of poor dietary habits, such as obesity and type-2 diabetes," said Dr Chloe Casey, Lecturer in Nutrition and co-author of the study. "However, the mental health implications of diet have been underexplored by comparison, particularly for drinks that are energy dense but low in nutrients," she added.

Anxiety disorders are a leading cause of mental distress among young people, in 2023 it was estimated that one in five children and young people had a mental health disorder, with anxiety one of the most reported conditions. 

The studies investigated by the research team measured sugary drink consumption and mental health of the young people through surveys. Beverages with high amounts of sugar can include fizzy drinks, energy drinks, sugary juices, squashes, sweetened tea and coffee, and flavoured milks.

The results consistently found a link between high levels of sugary drink consumption and anxiety.

The researchers emphasize that because of the nature of the studies they investigated, the findings do not provide evidence that drinking more sugary drinks directly causes anxiety. It is also possible that experiencing symptoms of anxiety leads to some young people consuming more sugary drinks. Or there could be other common factors – for example family life and sleeping disorders – that lead to both increased consumption and symptoms of anxiety. 

Whilst we may not be able to confirm at this stage what the direct cause is, this study has identified an unhealthy connection between consumption of sugary drinks and anxiety disorders in young people."

Dr. Chloe Casey, Lecturer in Nutrition and co-author of the study

"Anxiety disorders in adolescence have risen sharply in recent years so it is important to identify lifestyle habits which can be changed to reduce the risk of this trend continuing," she concluded. 

The study was led by former Bournemouth University PhD student, Dr Karim Khaled, who now works at Lebanese American University, Beirut.

Large-scale U.S. population data suggest that red meat consumption patterns may be associated with diabetes prevalence, whereas alternative protein choices may confer metabolic advantages.



Study: Association Between Red Meat Intake and Diabetes: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of a Nationally Representative Sample of U.S. Adults (NHANES 2003–2016). Image Credit: PeopleImages / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the British Journal of Nutrition, researchers examined the associations between total, processed, and unprocessed red meat intake and diabetes and evaluated the statistical substitution effects of alternative protein sources for red meat.

More than 37 million Americans have diabetes, and nearly 2 million new cases of diabetes each year are diagnosed in the United States (U.S.). The growing burden of diabetes has drawn greater attention to modifiable lifestyle factors, particularly dietary habits.

Red meat, especially processed varieties such as sausages and deli meats, is widely consumed in the U.S. diet and has been linked to increased risks of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, and premature mortality.

While there are inconsistencies in its association with diabetes prevalence, particularly in nationally representative populations, uncertainty remains about how red meat compares with other protein sources that may influence diabetes outcomes.

A better understanding of these relationships will help guide appropriate dietary guidelines and effective public health strategies, for which more research is needed.

This cross-sectional observational analysis used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2016, conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). NHANES employs multistage probability sampling designed to represent the non-institutionalized U.S. population. After excluding individuals with missing data, implausible energy consumption, or unknown diabetes status, 34,737 adults aged 18 years and older were included.

Dietary intake was assessed using up to two 24-hour dietary recalls collected with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Automated Multiple-Pass Method, which may not fully reflect usual long-term dietary intake and may introduce measurement error or recall bias. Red meat was classified as processed (e.g., sausages, frankfurters, luncheon meats) or unprocessed (e.g., beef, pork, lamb), and intake was measured in servings per day.

Diabetes was defined by self-report of physician diagnosis, fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥6.5%, or use of antidiabetic medications. Covariates included age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, poverty income ratio (PIR), body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity measured in metabolic equivalent of task (MET) minutes per week, psychological distress, food insecurity, and overall dietary factors.

Researchers used logistic regression models to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Substitution analyses were conducted to assess the impact of reducing red meat intake by half a serving per day through modeled dietary replacements, rather than observed behavioral changes.

Among 34,737 participants with a mean age of 45.8 years, 10.5% had diabetes. Individuals in the highest quintile of total red meat intake consumed a median of 5.72 ounces per day and were more likely to be younger, male, non-Hispanic White, married, and physically active. They also had higher BMI and higher intake of calories, alcohol, and sugary drinks than those in the lowest quintile.

After adjusting for demographics, lifestyle, socioeconomic status, and dietary habits (including fruit, vegetables, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, plant-based protein, whole grains, coffee, sugary drinks, and BMI), red meat consumption was significantly associated with an increased odds of diabetes, but this association does not establish a causal relationship.

Compared to participants with the lowest red meat intake, those in the highest quintile of total red meat intake had increased odds of diabetes, OR 1.49; 95% CIs 1.22-1.81; P-trend <0.001. Similar findings were observed for processed red meat intake, OR 1.47; 95% CIs 1.17-1.84; P-trend = 0.001, and unprocessed red meat intake, OR 1.24; 95% CIs 1.06-1.44; P-trend = 0.006.

Overall, these results indicate that the health consequences of dietary patterns depend on both the item being reduced and the item being substituted. In repeated analyses, each additional serving of total red meat per day corresponded to 16% higher odds of diabetes, OR 1.16; 95% CIs 1.07-1.25. Likewise, approximately 10% higher odds were associated with each serving of processed or unprocessed red meat consumed. No significant interaction was observed between red meat consumption and PIR, food insecurity, sex, age, or psychological distress.

Analysis of potential substitutions highlighted the practical effects of dietary patterns on the risk of diabetes. Participants who replaced one serving of total red meat per day with plant-based protein sources, such as nuts, seeds, legumes, and soy products, had 14% lower odds of diabetes, OR 0.86; 95% CIs 0.79-0.94.

Similarly, participants who substituted poultry, dairy, or whole grains for total red meat experienced reductions in the odds of diabetes of 11%-12%. Replacing red meat with plant-based protein sources was statistically associated with lower odds of diabetes, although causality cannot be established.

In this nationally representative sample of U.S. adults, higher intakes of total, processed, and unprocessed red meat were independently associated with an increased risk of diabetes.

The associations persisted after accounting for BMI and overall diet quality. Replacing red meat with plant-based protein sources, poultry, dairy products, and whole grains was associated with a lower odds of diabetes, but not with a proven risk reduction. 

Plant-based proteins showed the strongest statistical association in substitution models. These results illustrate that diet is a potentially modifiable factor associated with diabetes prevalence, although the cross-sectional design precludes conclusions regarding prevention or causation.

Potential biological explanations discussed in the research include the roles of saturated fat, heme iron, sodium, nitrates, and inflammation-related metabolic pathways. However, these mechanisms were not directly tested in this study.

Because this was a cross-sectional observational study, reverse causation and residual confounding remain possible, and the study could not distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Large international cohort data suggest plant-forward eating patterns and certain micronutrients may be linked to lower breast cancer risk and improved survival, highlighting diet as a potentially modifiable factor worth further investigation.

In a recent study published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition, researchers examined whether adherence to healthful plant-based diets and intake of specific micronutrients were associated with the risk of breast cancer and mortality among breast cancer patients.

Their findings suggest that higher adherence to a healthful, plant-based diet is linked to a decreased risk of breast cancer and reduced mortality after diagnosis. Greater intake of calcium, vitamins B2 and C, magnesium, and phosphorus, rather than breast cancer incidence, was associated with a lower risk of mortality, whereas higher sodium intake increased the risk of mortality. These associations were observational and do not establish causation.

Despite improvements in screening and treatment, the global burden of breast cancer continues to rise, underscoring the importance of identifying modifiable risk factors.

Diet is increasingly recognized as a potentially important determinant of both cancer development and prognosis. Plant-based dietary patterns, such as the Alternate Mediterranean Diet (AMED) and the Healthful Plant-Based Diet Index (HPDI), emphasize whole grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes, and other nutrient-dense plant foods while avoiding processed foods and red meat.

Plant-based diets are rich in antioxidants, fiber, and bioactive compounds that may exert anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. However, these biological mechanisms remain plausible hypotheses rather than proven causal pathways in this study. Although prior studies suggest that these diets are associated with lower breast cancer risk, evidence regarding their impact on survival after diagnosis remains limited and inconsistent.

Moreover, most research focuses on overall dietary patterns without disentangling the independent roles of specific micronutrients. The long-term predictive value of diet for breast cancer outcomes has also been insufficiently explored using advanced statistical and machine learning approaches. In this study, AMED associations were generally directionally protective but not statistically significant.

Researchers analyzed data from two prospective cohorts, the UK Biobank and the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). The UK Biobank sample included 67,045 individuals who did not have breast cancer and 3,397 women with breast cancer at baseline.

The CLHLS analysis included 7,431 cancer-free participants followed for incident overall cancer rather than breast cancer specifically. Dietary intake in the UK Biobank was assessed using a validated 24-hour recall, whereas CLHLS used a food frequency questionnaire. The cohorts differed substantially in age structure, ethnicity, and dietary assessment approaches, which may affect comparability.

Plant-based dietary adherence was measured using the HPDI and AMED scores. The HPDI incorporated 17 food groups, assigning positive scores to healthy plant foods and negative scores to animal foods and less healthy plant foods. Micronutrient intakes were calculated by linking reported food consumption to nutrient composition databases. Outcomes included incident breast cancer and all-cause mortality, identified through the respective national registries in UK Biobank, while CLHLS cancer outcomes were self-reported during follow-up surveys.

Associations were evaluated using multivariable proportional hazards modeling with progressive adjustment for demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and clinical factors. Restricted cubic spline models were used to assess potential nonlinear dose-response relationships.

Predictive performance was evaluated using concordance indices, Random Forest models, and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves at 3, 5, and 10 years.

Among UK Biobank participants, higher adherence to the HPDI was correlated with reduced breast cancer incidence and improved survival. Women in the highest HPDI tertile were 11% less likely to develop breast cancer compared to those in the lowest tertile. Each standard deviation increase in HPDI corresponded to a 4% reduction in risk.

Among women with breast cancer, those in the highest HPDI tertile experienced a 28% lower risk of all-cause mortality, and each standard deviation increase in HPDI was associated with an 11% reduction in mortality risk. No significant nonlinear associations were observed.

In the CLHLS cohort, higher Plant-Based Diet Index (PDI) scores were significantly associated with lower overall cancer incidence, with a 39% reduction in risk in the highest versus the lowest group.

Micronutrient analyses revealed that higher intakes of calcium, magnesium, copper, and vitamin C were correlated with lower breast cancer risk. Among patients, higher intakes of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and vitamin B2 were linked to lower mortality. These micronutrient associations differed by outcome, with some linked primarily to incidence and others to mortality. In contrast, each standard deviation increase in sodium intake increased mortality risk by 15%.

Predictive models showed modest discrimination overall. Micronutrients alone performed best in predicting breast cancer incidence, whereas HPDI showed the strongest performance in predicting five-year mortality. Combined models performed best at 10 years. Overall predictive accuracy was modest, suggesting limited immediate clinical predictive utility.

This large prospective study found that stronger observance of healthful plant-based diets was correlated with lower breast cancer incidence and improved survival after diagnosis.

Several micronutrients, particularly calcium, vitamin B2, vitamin C for incidence rather than mortality, magnesium, and phosphorus, showed independent protective associations, while sodium intake was linked to increased mortality. These findings align with prior research suggesting that plant-forward dietary patterns and nutrient-rich diets may reduce inflammation, oxidative stress, and cancer progression, although causal mechanisms remain uncertain.

Key strengths include the large sample size, prospective design, use of two international cohorts, and application of multiple analytical approaches, including spline models and machine learning. The simultaneous assessment of dietary patterns as well as individual micronutrients enhances interpretability.

However, limitations of the analysis include its observational design, precluding causal inference; confounding factors could not be excluded. Important risk factors for breast cancer, including hormone therapy and parity, were unavailable. Limited ethnic diversity in the UK Biobank and self-reported cancer data in CLHLS may affect generalizability. Dietary intake was assessed only at baseline, limiting the ability to assess dietary changes over time, and additional factors such as family history and detailed menopausal hormone data were incompletely captured.

U.S. men's national team manager Mauricio Pochettino will name his squad for March's friendlies against Belgium and Portugal in the coming weeks—a camp he's indicated will be the final chance for players to stake their claim for a place on the 2026 World Cup roster.

The 2026 MLS season is about to get underway, but those competing in Europe have been firing on all cylinders since the turn of the year due to a congested fixture schedule. It's allowed Americans abroad to continue finding their form ahead of this summer's showpiece event—even Christian Pulisic was back in action this past weekend for AC Milan after recovering from injury.

Here's Sports Illustrated look at the three USMNT talents who shone brightest in the latest round of matches.

German-American dual-national center back Noahkai Banks is an outside bet to make the USMNT's World Cup roster—but the 19-year-old is sure giving it a good go.

Making his 16th consecutive start for FC Augsburg, Banks put in a composed display as his side saw off FC Heidenheim 1–0, registering a fourth Bundesliga clean sheet of the season. He completed 37 of 39 passes, delivered three passes into the final third and amassed nine clearances, four of which came aerially.  

More impressively, Banks played with a maturity beyond his tender years—an improvement in his game that can perhaps be attributed to past conversations he's had with Pochettino, who was a central defender in his playing days.

“[Pochettino] knows the position very well,” Banks said in a recent interview with the Bundesliga. “He helped me with small details like positioning, the small things that make the difference at the highest level. He gave me tips, and I hope I can use them going forward.

“I'm happy with the U.S., but you never know what the future brings.”

As Weston McKennie made his way back to Turin after a chaotic 3–2 Juventus loss to Inter Milan on Saturday, there's a good chance he was imagining what the season would have looked like had Luciano Spalletti started the season in charge.

Since the Italian took over at the beginning of November, McKennie has been one of the world's most in-form players. McKennie controlled the midfield against the Serie A leaders, assisting on both of his side's goals to take his total to four since Thanksgiving—in that time, McKennie has also bagged seven goals.

The 27-year-old also had two shots on target of his own and slotted five passes into the final third, all while playing an active role as a deep-lying forward,

A series of controversial calls, most notably the red card issued to Pierre Kalulu, contributed to Juventus' eventual defeat, but there's no doubt that McKennie, who is out of contract in the summer, did his chances of earning a new, improved deal no harm at all.

Patrick Agyemang continued his stellar form with a goal in an 88-minute showing in Derby County's 2–0 win over Swansea City in EFL Championship action on Saturday, bringing him to 10 goals and three assists in 25 league matches this season. 

While the 25-year-old has showcased his scoring touch all season since joining Charlotte FC in the summer, it is clear he has developed as well. When in MLS, many of his best chances came from his long strides on balls played low through the middle—rarely, if ever, was he an aerial threat, even though he stands 6'3" tall and is well built.

Since arriving in England, there's been a clear improvement. This weekend, he rose highest to score from a corner kick, marking the sixth time he has scored with his head this season—60% of his overall tally.

He also drew the most fouls in the match with five and won 11 duels, showcasing to Pochettino the nuisance he could be up front were he to be selected as one of the USMNT's striker picks.

ATLANTA, Ga. – LSU Soccer standout Sariyah Bailey has been called up to the U.S. Under-19 Women's National Team for its upcoming international training camp in Portugal, marking a historic milestone as the first active LSU Soccer player to receive a U.S. Women's National Team call-up. The official roster was announced on Monday by the U.S. Soccer Federation.

Bailey will represent the United States at the youth national level as the squad travels to Porto, Portugal from February 21 through March 7 for a series of international friendlies against Czechia, Wales and host nation Portugal. The matches will be the team's first international competition of 2026 as the group prepares for the 2026 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup.

Players born on or after Jan. 1, 2006, are age-eligible for next year's 2026 FIFA Women's U-20 World Cup in Poland, meaning all 20 players in camp are training and playing for a shot at that tournament.

The USA will take on Czechia on Feb. 27 at Estadio Municipal de Arouca and Wales on March 2 at Estadio Conde Dias Garcia before finishing against host Portugal on March 6 back at Estadio Municipal de Arouca. These are the first international matches of 2026 for this group of players, 15 of which were born in 2007 and five who were born in 2008.

Bailey, a rising sophomore out of Edmonton, Canada, is coming off of one of the most impressive freshman campaigns in program history in 2025, where she played a pivotal role in LSU's historic run to their first-ever NCAA Sweet 16. In her debut season, she appeared in all 25 matches for the Tigers, tallying nine goals—third most on the team—and seven assists —most on the team—while quickly establishing herself as one of the program's top offensive threats.

The forward recorded 1,458 minutes and 19 starts as a freshman. Her standout performance all season long earned her All-SEC and SEC All-Freshman Team honors and Top Drawer Soccer recognition, cementing her as one of the top freshmen in the country.

Bailey's call-up highlights her continued rise on the national stage and places her among the top young talent in the country. She is one of 20 players selected to the U-19 roster, which features a mix of collegiate, professional and youth standouts competing for future international opportunities

With her selection, Bailey continues to elevate LSU Soccer's presence on the national stage while gaining valuable international experience against top global competition.

ATLANTA – The U.S. Under-19 Women's National Team will travel to Portugal from Feb. 21-March 7 to play three friendly matches outside of Porto.

The USA will take on Czechia on Feb. 27 at Estadio Municipal de Arouca and Wales on March 2 at Estadio Conde Dias Garcia before finishing against host Portugal on March 6 at back at Estadio Municipal de Arouca.

The roster features two players from the USL Super League. Ashlyn Puerta from Sporting JAX has 11 goals scored in 15 matches to lead the league. Sealey Strawn, who has scored three goals for Dallas Trinity FC, is the other. The two NWSL players are goalkeeper Even O'Steen, who signed with Seattle Reign FC at age 17 in January, and Chicago Stars forward Micayla Johnson, who scored her first NWSL goal last season against Utah and had two goals in the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup.

Players born on or after Jan. 1, 2006, are age-eligible for next year's 2026 FIFA Women's U-20 World Cup in Poland, meaning all 20 players in camp are training and playing for a shot at that tournament.

England and Scotland's 2026 FIFA World Cup group matches could face uncertainty due to an ongoing dispute involving Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts.

Local officials have not yet approved the required entertainment license for the venue, creating the possibility that scheduled fixtures may need to be moved if an agreement is not reached.

With the tournament approaching, the disagreement underscores tensions between town authorities and FIFA organizers over funding and security responsibilities.

Gillette Stadium, home of the New England Patriots and temporarily branded as “Boston Stadium” for the World Cup, is set to host seven matches.

That includes England's group fixture against Ghana and Scotland's scheduled games against Haiti and Morocco.

However, Foxborough officials have stated they will not grant the entertainment license unless FIFA agrees to provide approximately $7.7 million to $8 million upfront to cover security and public safety expenses.

Town leaders have argued they cannot advance those costs without financial guarantees.

Local representatives have emphasized that the World Cup is a global event and should not place an undue burden on local taxpayers. Without clarity on funding arrangements, the license remains pending.

Reports indicate that town officials have set a mid-March deadline for resolving the issue before making a final decision on the license.

If the dispute is not settled, the seven planned matches at the stadium, including knockout round fixtures, could be affected.

FIFA, local organizers and stadium representatives have said discussions are ongoing in an effort to secure a resolution.

Federal funding designated for host cities may assist with security costs, but details regarding distribution remain uncertain.

For now, England and Scotland's group stage matches remain scheduled for Gillette Stadium. Whether they proceed there as planned will depend on the outcome of the negotiations in the coming weeks.

Gonzalo Garcia has been quite the find for Real Madrid this season, especially after his breakthrough at the FIFA Club World Cup.

While the Spaniard's first half of the season was far from ideal, under the leadership of Xabi Alonso, the appointment of Alvaro Arbeloa has worked wonders for the player.

While Kylian Mbappe still remains the undisputed number nine for Real Madrid, Garcia has emerged as an intriguing alternative, who has been racking up the minutes since the turn of the year, even earning praise for his qualities.

As reported by Diario AS, there is still an outside chance for Garcia to be selected into the Spanish team for the upcoming FIFA World Cup in North America.

Spain coach Luis de la Fuente lacks a definitive candidate for the centre-forward role, as current options like Mikel Oyarzabal and Ferran Torres are not natural strikers.

The leading candidate, Samu Omorodion, has been ruled out of the tournament following a devastating cruciate ligament tear.

This injury has left the search for a traditional number nine more open than ever, giving Gonzalo a genuine outside chance if his clinical form continues.

The numbers behind Gonzalo's rise are increasingly difficult for both club and country to ignore. He has already been involved in eight goals – six goals and two assists – across 950 minutes of action this season.

This equates to a goal involvement every 119 minutes, proving he can deliver significant output with limited opportunities.

This is a quality that often becomes useful at a stage like the World Cup, as evidenced by the success of a certain Mirsolav Klose.

Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp turned down approaches from Manchester United and Chelsea after leaving Anfield, according to his agent and trusted advisor Marc Kosicke. The German coach opted to take a break from football following his departure from the Reds but has already been lured back into work as the Head of Global Soccer for Red Bull. 

Klopp achieved great success during his time at Liverpool, winning the Champions League in 2019 and then leading Liverpool to their first league title in 30 years in 2019-20. The German coach also won the FA Cup, League Cup and Club World Cup during his time with the Reds before shocking fans all over the world by announcing his departure in 2024. Klopp explained why he was leaving in an emotional statement, saying: "I told the club already in November. I can understand that it's a shock for a lot of people in this moment, when you hear it for the first time, but obviously I can explain it - or at least try to explain it. I love absolutely everything about this club, I love everything about the city, I love everything about our supporters, I love the team, I love the staff. I love everything. But that I still take this decision shows you that I am convinced it is the one I have to take. It is that I am, how can I say it, running out of energy. I have no problem now, obviously, I knew it already for longer that I will have to announce it at one point, but I am absolutely fine now. I know that I cannot do the job again and again and again and again."

Kosicke has now revealed how clubs have been trying to tempt Klopp back into management, claiming he's already turned down approaches from two of Liverpool's Premier League rivals: He told Transfermarkt: "Even Chelsea and Manchester United enquired, although Jürgen had clearly stated that he would not coach any other club in England. These enquiries keep coming. He's extremely happy with what he's achieved. And it's still wonderful to go down in history as one of the few coaches who only managed three clubs and were never fired.

"Maybe at some point he'll say he needs to smell the locker room again. But at the moment he's very, very happy in his role. Before joining Red Bull, Jürgen could have coached the USA or England. Probably also Germany, if Julian Nagelsmann hadn't already been there."

Klopp has spoken about how he's been enjoying life away from the dugout and hasn't missed football management since taking over at Red Bull. He was asked in September by The Athletic if he intends to expects his absence from the touchline to continue and answered: "That's what I think. But you don't know. I'm 58. If I started again at 65, everybody will say, ‘You said you'll never do it again!' Er, sorry, I thought 100 per cent (when I said it)! That is what I think now. I don't miss anything.”

Klopp may be out of the management game for now but his name continues to crop up whenever managerial vacancies arise. He has already been linked with a sensational return to Anfield this season amid uncertainty over Arne Slot's position at Liverpool. The Dutchman's side have put up a dismal defence of their Premier League trophy, despite a summer of heavy investment, and currently sit in sixth place in the table.

Manchester United interim boss Michael Carrick has been told that he simply must qualify for the Champions League if he is to earn the permanent manager's job at Old Trafford. The former England midfielder has enjoyed a sterling start to life since replacing Ruben Amorim, going unbeaten in his first five league games, to put himself in contention to remain in the United hotseat.

Carrick has enjoyed an incredible start to life at Old Trafford since taking over from Amorim in an interim capacity. He has guided United to four wins and one draw since stepping into the dugout, with the club currently sitting in fourth, one point clear of fifth-placed Chelsea. United are also just five points behind Aston Villa in third, and 12 behind leaders Arsenal. Now, former United defender Mikael Silvestre has told his old team-mate exactly what he needs to do to earn the job on a permanent basis.

Mikaël Silvestre was speaking to Sky Bet: “Michael Carrick will be considered for the job if he maintains that Champions League spot, and if the players believe in what he's doing. He's in the best position right now because it's a long interview process for the permanent role.

“Every training session and every game is an opportunity for him to show his worth. He's got nothing to lose because he came in as a caretaker. He knows the dressing room, the players, and the club, and that gives him an advantage over someone coming from outside.

“If you're talking about a long-term project, he's a young manager and you can expect him to keep evolving and developing. He's put himself a great position with his results, but he needs to stay focused and keep working.”

Carrick has made Kobbie Mainoo a major part of his United rebuild, bringing him back in from the cold into which he had been banished by Amorim. 

He has started every single one of Carrick's games in charge thus far, and Silvestre has credited the England international for his comeback, adding: “It was obvious that Ruben Amorim preferred playing Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, and he saw Kobbie Mainoo as more of a replacement for Bruno. That meant there wasn't really room for him in the team.

“Credit to Kobbie though, because his level never dropped - it was just the choices in the starting 11 that made it difficult for him to play. Now it's different, and the good thing is that he never stopped working. When he got his opportunity, he showed he could go 90 minutes and impact games as if he'd never left the team. Credit to him for staying positive and not giving up.”

Carrick won Manager of the Month for January, and took the time to credit his coaching staff, and playing staff, for returning United to form.

He added: “I think it's about everyone: it's about the staff, the coaching staff, the backroom staff, and the players definitely. It shows that we've had a good start, which is very pleasing.”

“The boys have been good,” Carrick continued. “It's not easy with change and to click into gear and to perform the way they have done in different types of games has probably been as pleasing as anything. 

“Obviously the first two games, in some ways, they take care of themselves because of the emotion and how everyone's kind of up for them but the games after them have been, for me, just as good to see the boys' reaction and the quality of the play.

“Going into those games, it was challenging and then, three days before the City game [me and the staff] come in… again, that's why I credit the players for putting themselves forward really, and reacting to change.

“But certainly those two games give you a massive boost of all sorts of emotions to use moving forward, which was the key.

“After those games are done, it's what happens next and that's what I've been really delighted with, the reaction after that.”

Christian Pulisic took advantage of the 2026 Winter Olympics taking place in his home city, as the AC Milan star was in attendance for the USA's 5-1 win over Germany in men's hockey on Sunday, Feb. 15.

Pulisic was in the stands at Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena as the USA earned a bye into Wednesday's quarterfinals with a dominant win.

The U.S. men's national team forward returned from a brief injury lay-off on Friday, Feb. 13, coming off the bench as Milan defeated Pisa 2-1 to maintain its Serie A title challenge.

Pulisic made it back to Milan in time to catch the USA in action, taking time to give an interview to the NHL's in-house media channel along the way.

The USMNT star estimated he'd been to "less than 10, 15" hockey games in his life, most of which were the minor league Hershey Bears in his Pennsylvania hometown.

Pulisic said that having the Olympics in Milan was providing him with extra motivation with the World Cup coming to the United States this summer.

"Just seeing some of these guys doing what they're doing, competing at the highest level in their sport, supporting team USA, it definitely gives me that extra drive and gets me excited for the summer," he said.

Pulisic also spoke about the difference between playing in high-pressure competitions for AC Milan and the USMNT.

"There's always pressure in some of the biggest competitions, whether club or country. But I think when you play for your country, you always have that little extra sense of pride representing team USA," he said.

"It's the best thing you can do. It's the most proud I am when I'm playing. So it's similar, but definitely something special when you play for your country."

Brighton are refusing to take no for an answer in their pursuit of Koln sensation Said El Mala. The Seagulls, ever the masters of identifying Europe's most exciting young talent, have lodged a fresh formal offer for the 19-year-old winger. Despite the Bundesliga side's previous reluctance to sell, Fabian Hurzeler's side is pushing harder than ever to secure the teenager's signature before his value spirals out of reach.

The English club's interest is anything but new. Brighton were already keen on El Mala last summer, but their pursuit has intensified following his rapid rise this season. 

In January, the Premier League outfit were reportedly ready to offer a total package of up to €30 million - a figure that would have seen the player remain in Germany on loan for the remainder of the current campaign. However, Koln's hierarchy stood firm, with sporting director Thomas Kessler famously rejecting the lucrative proposal from England out of hand.

According to Sky Sport, Brighton's January opening move was substantial, featuring a guaranteed transfer fee of approximately €25-26m. The deal also included a 10 per cent sell-on clause and would have seen El Mala earn a gross salary of up to €3.5m per season in the Premier League. In a unique twist, the Seagulls even offered to sign his brother, Malek, who currently plays for Koln's reserve side, but Kessler refused to engage in negotiations to avoid unsettling the squad during their relegation battle.

Kessler has been vocal about his desire to keep the youngster, stating: "As a rule, I do not comment on speculation like that in detail. What matters to us is that Said has made very positive progress in a short time and has contributed significantly to our season so far with his performances. It is important for us to closely support him, provide him with stability, and take the next steps together so that he continues to help us in the second half of the season."

While the club remains publicly defiant, the player's situation in the Domstadt is becoming increasingly complex. Minor issues are said to have fuelled the tension between El Mala and head coach Lukas Kwasniok, including public comments and a lack of starting opportunities. Despite contributing seven goals and three assists this term, the winger has been used as a substitute in 13 of his 22 Bundesliga appearances, a role that has reportedly left the Krefeld-born talent feeling frustrated and seeking a new challenge.

Addressing the player's long-term commitment, Kessler noted that the club deliberately tied Said to a long-term contract until 2030 without a release clause. He added: "We deliberately tied Said to the club on a long-term basis before the season because we are convinced of his development and have a clear plan for him. At the same time, it is part of our business to deal with market-related matters. We do this seriously and with the necessary calm. For us, the focus is on Said being an important part of our sporting concept, and we expect that he will continue his path with FC Koln."

Despite the official bid, Brighton are currently pushing for a quick decision as they fear the winger's price tag could skyrocket toward €40m in the summer. There is a growing sense within the German club that even more lucrative offers could arrive during the next window, particularly from domestic heavyweights Bayern Munich. The record champions are reportedly keeping a close eye on El Mala as a potential long-term backup for Luis Díaz, meaning Brighton must act swiftly to avoid losing out.

The saga is poised for a dramatic conclusion this summer. If El Mala's situation regarding playing time does not improve under Kwasniok, the attacker is expected to push for a move away. Whether he heads to England or remains within the Bundesliga, it is clear that Koln's resolve will be tested once again. Brighton have made their move, but with the world's biggest clubs watching, the race for one of Germany's brightest prospects is only just beginning.

Athletic Club have been rocked by a major fitness blow as star winger Nico Williams has been sidelined indefinitely to deal with a persistent pubalgia issue. The Euro 2024 hero has been struggling with the abdominal problem since the start of the season. Despite attempts to manage the injury through a combination of tailored training and match minutes, the club finally decided to pull the 23-year-old out of action following the recent match against Real Oviedo.

Despite attempts to manage the injury through a combination of tailored training and managed minutes, the club finally decided to pull the 23-year-old out of action after he missed their recent La Liga victory.

The situation has reached a breaking point for both the player and the coaching staff. Following the clash at the Carlos Tartiere, Athletic boss Ernesto Valverde made his stance clear on the winger's deteriorating physical state. "Nico has problems and is not 100 per cent. We can't go on like this. We continue to work on different options, for the moment alternating treatment and competition, and if he does not recover, we are considering letting him rest for a few weeks in order to strengthen the affected area," the former Barcelona manager explained. Consequently, the player has officially begun a specialised reinforced treatment plan involving external specialists to address the root cause of the pain.

The severity of the situation was further highlighted by the player's brother, Inaki, who revealed the emotional and physical toll the injury has taken. Speaking after the Oviedo match, the elder Williams brother didn't hold back on the struggles Nico has faced behind the scenes. "He's in a bad way, he's been carrying discomfort since September... It's true that with the pubis, some days you're very good and the next you're bad. I already commented last week that he had told me that he was beginning to see the light... And now it seems that it is two or three steps back," Inaki confessed. 

Statistically, the impact of the injury on Nico's season is undeniable. While he has appeared in 26 matches across all competitions, he has only been fit enough to start 18 of those, and his influence has waned significantly compared to his blistering form of last season. His total pitch time of 1,728 minutes is nearly 1,200 minutes fewer than teammate Mikel Jauregizar, illustrating how much time the winger has spent in the treatment room or on the bench as a precautionary measure. Inaki added that "he was starting to see the light, and now it looks like he's taken two or three steps back," as the relapse forced the club to seek more aggressive non-surgical solutions.

The timing of this "injury hell" could not be worse with the 2026 World Cup on the horizon. There is now a growing fear that if this conservative treatment fails, Nico may have to resort to surgery, which would almost certainly end his season and potentially rule him out of the tournament in North America. Reports suggest that surgery would require a recovery of at least two months, but could extend to three or four months, leaving him no time to regain match fitness before the June kick-off. Spain manager Luis de la Fuente will be watching closely, as Williams remains a fundamental pillar of the national team's attack.

Athletic Club's director of football, Mikel Gonzalez, recently outlined the delicate roadmap the club is following to avoid the operating table. Earlie this month, Gonzalez stated: "We continue working on different options, and if he doesn't recover, we will assess stopping for a few weeks to insist on abdominal reinforcement treatment." That hiatus has now officially begun. While the club has not put a public timeframe on his return, sources close to the medical team suggest he will be out for a minimum of four weeks, making him a major doubt for the upcoming Copa del Rey semi-final clash against Real Sociedad.

Opting against surgery is a calculated risk for the Basque outfit. Modern medical consensus often leans away from operating on pubalgia in explosive players, as it can lead to a permanent loss of the very speed and acceleration that makes Nico such a lethal threat on the flank. The club's medical hierarchy remains firm that an operation does not guarantee a 100% recovery and would sideline their prized asset for three to six months.

For now, the San Mames faithful must wait and hope that this period of total rest and core strengthening can finally fix the problem. The club is under no pressure to rush him back, with Inaki suggesting that the team's current schedule provides a window for patience. However, with no definitive timeline regarding his availability for the most important games of the season, the uncertainty continues to loom over Bilbao. Athletic will have to learn to live without their most dynamic spark as Nico battles to save his season and his World Cup dreams.

Just how good can Patrick Agyemang get? Another goal posed that question at the weekend as the big striker continues to develop and improve his game.

And in Italy, Weston McKennie shone above the San Siro drama on Sunday — and Christian Pulisic made a welcome return to action.

As the World Cup finals in the United States, Mexico and Canada edge ever closer, welcome to this week's USMNT player tracker.

A corner kick, a towering leap and an unstoppable header. Agyemang took his 10th goal of the Championship season in classic centre-forward fashion.

It was a landmark moment for him, and the 25-year-old has surprised many with the pace of his acclimatisation to European football since joining Derby County from Charlotte FC last summer.

Agyemang now has as many goals as compatriot Haji Wright in the league this season, and if he keeps going at this rate may also overtake the Coventry striker's haul in his own debut campaign in England (16). He is also on track to usurp Josh Sargent (who scored 13 goals for Norwich City in his first year in the Championship, albeit after scoring two goals in the Premier League the season before).



But while Wright came to England on the back of a successful spell in the Turkish top flight with Antalyaspor and with Bundesliga experience at Schalke under his belt, Agyemang's CV is very different.

The striker had no MLS academy experience, started playing college soccer with division three Eastern Connecticut University before transferring to Rhode Island in 2020, where he remained until being drafted by Charlotte in 2022.

The MLS club saw his raw potential, as did scouts from Derby, before they paid £8million ($10.9m) for him on the back of two seasons in MLS.

Now, USMNT boss Mauricio Pochettino must be giving the Connecticut-born forward some serious thought, too.

If, as his club manager John Eustace points out, Agyemang is still very much a work in progress, and he is scoring double figures already, just how high is the 6ft 4in (193cm) player's ceiling?

Is he already ahead of Sargent, in limbo amid his attempts to leave Norwich during the winter window, and catching up with Wright in the pecking order to support first choices Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi?

“I thought Patrick at times today was unplayable,” Eustace told the Derby website after their 2-0 win over Swansea on Saturday. “He really caused their defence a lot of problems and you can see him maturing and getting more confident.

“His work-rate off the ball was much better today and that's improving all the time. He's understanding the tactical side of it a little bit more.

“Carlton (Morris) is his mentor from the start of the season and even when he's been injured, he's looking after Patrick and helping him, so those two will play a big part in what we want to do until the end of the season.”

Agyemang may yet play a part in the USMNT's next World Cup warm-up games against Belgium next month and then Portugal in April.

The striker who scored on his international debut a little over a year ago against Venezuela just keeps improving. It is a timely trajectory.

Another week, another impactful McKennie performance for Juventus.

The major talking point after the Turin side lost 3-2 against league leaders Inter may have been a controversial red card for his team.

But McKennie's ongoing contributions cannot go unnoticed. After scoring last week in the draw with Lazio, he turned creator on Saturday, setting up both Juve goals at San Siro.

The American's performance won't be remembered as much as that awful second yellow (and red) for Pierre Kalulu, and yet another VAR debate, but when the dust has settled, it's fair to wonder if there is a Serie A midfielder in better form than the 27-year-old this season?



It may have only been for 17 minutes, but Christian Pulisic was back on the pitch and enjoying that winning feeling for Milan on Friday.

As he strives to overcome a persistent muscle issue, the USMNT star has not started for the Rossoneri since January 18.

He had to settle for a spot on the bench again on Friday at Pisa, but came on in the 77th minute to help Max Allegri's side see out a win that kept some pressure on first-placed Inter.

Elsewhere in Italy, two Americans went head-to-head in the second tier on Saturday.

In the end, it was Venezia's Gianluca Busio who had the upper hand over Cesena goalkeeper Jonathan Klinsmann, as the former's team won 4-0.

Busio scored an impressive free-kick to begin the rout, sending Venezia top of Serie B and on track for promotion.

It's Champions League time again, with several Americans involved in play-off fixtures to determine their teams' progress.

The action kicks off on Tuesday when Juventus face a daunting trip to Galatasaray in Turkey (12:45pm ET, Paramount +). At least with McKennie in this type of form, they have a player capable of unlocking any defence.

Later that day, Balogun and Monaco have a tough match against familiar opponents, as they face reigning French and European champions Paris Saint-Germain (3pm ET, Paramount +).

On Wednesday, Bayer Leverkusen travel to Olympiacos for the first leg of their double-header (3pm ET, Paramount +). The German outfit will hope USMNT midfielder Malik Tillman, who played the second half of their 4-0 Bundesliga win over St. Pauli at the weekend, can recapture the form of their last league phase game when he scored twice against Villarreal.

Also, see if Johnny Cardoso can keep his place in Atletico Madrid's starting line-up (he played in their 3-0 loss at Rayo Vallecano in La Liga on Sunday). Diego Simeone's team must navigate a trip to Belgium against Club Brugge (Wednesday, 3pm ET, Paramount +).

In the Europa League, Auston Trusty and Celtic will look to keep their good form going, after they stayed in contention for the Scottish title with a 3-2 comeback win at Kilmarnock on Sunday. Thursday sees the Glasgow club face the impressive Stuttgart, fourth in the Bundesliga, in another two-legged play-off for a place in the last 16 (3pm, Paramount +).

The same format applies in the Conference League, where Chris Richards and Crystal Palace, who had a weekend off after being dumped out of the FA Cup in the previous round, go to Bosnia on Thursday to face Zrinjski Mostar (12:45pm ET, Paramount +).

Finally, on Wednesday, in domestic action, Villarreal play Levante (2pm, ESPN +). USMNT defender Alex Freeman came on as a 79th-minute substitute against Getafe at the weekend, and he is edging closer to a first start for the Spanish side since his winter transfer from Orlando City.

File: Super Eagles

Kindly share this story:

Nigeria's Super Eagles are set to take on Jordan in an international friendly in Amman during the March 23–31 FIFA window.
According to a report by NTA on Monday, the match will mark the first-ever senior meeting between the two nations and forms part of Jordan's preparation for their debut World Cup appearance.
Nicknamed “The Chivalrous Ones,” Jordan has been drawn into a challenging World Cup group alongside defending champions Argentina, Algeria, and Austria.
Reports also indicate that Iran is exploring a March fixture against the three-time African champions, while a potential June clash with Portugal is under consideration.  




However, Nigeria's participation in the game will depend on FIFA's upcoming ruling on the country's eligibility protest against the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).  Related News  DHQ confirms PUNCH's report on US troops, arms arrival  Lassa fever kills four health workers in Benue, says commissioner  NCDC raises the alarm as Lassa fever kills two health workers, 15 infected   
PUNCH Online reports that FIFA is scheduled to review Nigeria's petition on Monday (today), which alleges that DR Congo fielded six ineligible players during last year's 2026 World Cup African play-offs.
Nigeria lost on penalties to DR Congo in Morocco, marking the second consecutive time the West African country will not qualify for the World Cup.        
The outcome of the FIFA meeting could potentially reinstate the Super Eagles into the intercontinental play-offs in Mexico later this month, where one of the last World Cup tickets will be decided.
With both Nigeria and DR Congo reportedly prepared to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if dissatisfied, world football's governing body is said to be treating the file with exceptional caution to avoid reputational damage.

AI-generated summary reviewed by our newsroom.

It's been a heck of a week for the future of the World Cup in Kansas City.

Unprecedented, actually.

Three FIFA top-10 teams announced they will make Kansas City their home for the World Cup this summer — Argentina, England and the Netherlands.

How did Kansas City become the only metropolitan area in the country with base camps for three top-10 teams? I dug into that in a column earlier this week — how Kansas City transformed from a long-shot World Cup host city into what FIFA officials are referring to as the base capital of the tournament.

This story? It's more simply for the entertainment.

I shared a brief version of this anecdote in Friday's column, but Argentina capped their only visit to Kansas City in the most Kansas City fashion.

With barbecue.

At the conclusion of their half-week trip, former Sporting KC chief operating officer Alan Dietrich, the lead tour guide for the base camp visits, asked Argentina representatives if they were interested in Latin food or authentic Kansas City barbecue.

They all wanted the barbecue.

Five of them — Dietrich plus four Argentina officials — went to Jack Stack, its downtown Freight House location.

On the Argentina group's request, they ordered five two-meat platters of food. The Kansas City Combo, Jack Stack calls it.

Along with the platters, they ordered every side item Jack Stack has on the menu — the fries, beans, cheesy corn, potato salad and coleslaw. All of it.

“I thought, you know, this seems like a good amount of food,” Dietrich said, before a pause. “They killed it.”

They weren't done.

When offered dessert, they each ordered the carrot cake and triple chocolate brownie.

Killed that, too.

“They kept saying, ‘This is really good,'” Dietrich said.

It's not why Argentina settled on Kansas City.

But it sure didn't hurt the experience.

“It was cool, because definitely part of the heart of Kansas City is the barbecue,” Dietrich said. “And they just really enjoyed it.”

Argentina didn't visit KC until after the draw was unveiled. Even though the star-driven team will open the defense of its 2022 title with a match at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium, the soccer world still anticipated it would base camp in Miami, the MLS home to their star, Lionel Messi. The beach city is less than a 3-hour plane ride to each of Argentina's group-stage matches.

But when Argentina sent a half-dozen officials on the trip to Kansas City, the KC2026 group began to think maybe they could persuade them.

Argentina fell in love with Sporting's training facility in Wyandotte County, where they will hold their practices.

Their hotel location on the Missouri side? It's about a 10-minute drive to Jack Stack.

The Super Eagles' appeal against DR Congo is reaching its conclusion… What will FIFA decide?

Nigeria - RDC/ @x.com/destinmvula40/

The Nigerian Football Federation is anxiously awaiting the final decision from the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) regarding the appeal lodged against the result of the African playoff between Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo, as part of the qualification for the 2026 World Cup.

According to Daily Post Nigeria, the world governing body is expected to officially announce its decision in the coming hours regarding the complaint filed last December by the Nigerian federation, following the elimination of the Super Eagles.

The match, played in Morocco last November, ended in a 1-1 draw after regular time and extra time. The Democratic Republic of Congo ultimately secured their ticket with a 4-3 victory in the penalty shootout, thus earning their place in the next round of qualifiers.

Nigeria's appeal is based on a challenge concerning the eligibility of certain Congolese players. The federation claims that the procedures for changing the sporting nationality for several of them may not have fully complied with FIFA regulations. As a result, it is demanding a review of the match result and a thorough examination of the administrative status of the players involved.

If FIFA upholds the result, DR Congo will continue their journey in the intercontinental playoff scheduled from March 23 to 31. Conversely, if the complaint is deemed admissible, the qualification process could be thrown into question.

MetLife Stadium will have the eyes of the world on it on July 19.

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and perceptions could be vastly different depending on which side of the pond you're from.

The 82,500-capacity home of the NFL's New York Giants and Jets will be the jewel in the crown of the FIFA World Cup having been chosen to host the final.

Inside, fans will be treated to large concourses with a variety of options and aside from the prices, the facilities should have few complaints.

Getting there is a different matter.

While a huge arena surrounded by tens of thousands of car parking spaces is a common sight in the U.S., many international fans are used to walking to matches.

There are hotels withing walking distance of MetLife, but signs have been posted by the New Jersey State Police warning that it is 'illegal' and 'dangerous.'

Some of the hundreds of thousands fans watching matches at the summer tournament will arrive by train or shuttle bus, but the rest will take cars or Ubers.

Photos of the warning and concrete jungle went viral in February, with the caption 'genuinely horrific and dystopian.'

The comments were flooded with fans sharing similar experiences.

"I have suffered the MetLife many times," wrote one. "I remember one night that was impossible to walk to the parking lot across the expressway because the walking bridge was completely blocked with people for almost two hours. That stadium is a huge mess."

"My 2 pennies' worth (largely irrelevant I know but, hey, that's twitter) ... was at the MetLife last summer for CWC and it is genuinely, surprisingly s***. A truly horrible experience," another added after watching the Club World Cup. "I hope, but don't expect, that some of the lessons from last summer have been learnt."

Much of the debate centered on Americans' love of cars.

One responded said: "Y'all didn't know New Jersey is designed for cars and not pedestrians since forever?"

"The European mind cannot comprehend this level of car centrism," added another.

"What's wrong? Everyone has a car, so there is no need for other infrastructure. That's not Europe, where care is a luxury," a third noted.

The U.S. is blessed with some of the world's finest stadiums, but cultural differences will always rise up.

It's what the World Cup is all about.

Ranking the top 10......

Quarterbacks of all-time - Can anyone better Tom Brady?

Wide receivers of all-time - Does Randy Moss or Jerry Rice come out on top?

Running backs of all-time - Stacking Jim Brown, Barry Sanders, Walter Payton, Emmitt Smith and more

Tight ends of all-time - How does Travis Kelce compare?

MetLife Stadium will hold eight matches as part of a massive 32-team tournament.

They include five group stage games, in Groups C, E, I and L, plus a round-of-32 clash, last-16 fixture and the final.

It opened in 2010 at a cost of $1.6 billion and was part of New York's failed bid for the 2012 Olympic Games, which went to London.

MetLife did host quarter-finals at both the 2011 and 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cups, plus the final of the historic Copa Amezrica Centenario in 2016.

Nine games at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup were held there, including both semi-finals and the final in a trial run for July.

Super Bowl XLVIII and WrestleMania 29 and 35 are among the highlights, while Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band and Taylor Swift hold the record number of shows with nine each.

Tottenham Sack

Maybe it shouldn't have come as too much of a surprise that Thomas Tuchel committed to England until 2028. He has only had the role for a year and, as the English Football Association chief executive Mark Bullingham put it, “he's really enjoying the job”.

So much so that Tuchel is willing to pass up the chance to return to the club game after the World Cup this summer. While Bullingham didn't deny the existence of a break clause in his contract, the news of an extension signalled that Tuchel is ruling himself out of contention for prospective openings in Manchester and Madrid.

It continues an intriguing trend of elite coaches working in international football earlier in their careers and for longer. You get more time to think, watch and learn. You can visit clubs, get a feel for them through greater access. You're also able to select a squad without an owner or a sporting director constraining you due to profitability and sustainability rules and upcoming contract renewals. Choice is limited to the talent a nation produces but the choice is at least yours. That's not the case in the club game, where a manager's role is increasingly restricted to the whiteboard, the training ground and the 90 minutes your team play every three days.

Judging by some of the jaded comments from Pep Guardiola and Arne Slot, winning leagues and cups these days is far too quickly forgotten. Lifting a World Cup is not — and this summer's edition, as the biggest and most-covered of all time, has captured the imagination of the elite. It is perhaps why, for instance, Julian Nagelsmann stayed on as Germany coach after the 2024 European Championship in his home country. But Tuchel committing beyond the World Cup, until Euro 2028, is interesting, and it coincides with news that Carlo Ancelotti is set to carry on as Brazil coach through to 2030.

Ancelotti is older and perhaps even more fulfilled than Tuchel — who, lest we forget, has won league titles in Germany and France and a Champions League in England — but the 66-year-old Italian is still the perfect Real Madrid coach at a time when Real Madrid need a coach.

It raises a couple of questions: is international football reasserting itself as the pinnacle? And where do these superclubs in need of supercoaches now turn? This summer would be the end of an era if Guardiola leaves Manchester City after 10 years. One imagines that if he does, he would go on another sabbatical (or… take a national team job).

Zinedine Zidane has patiently sat out the past six years, waiting for Didier Deschamps to relinquish his post as France coach, which he finally will after the World Cup. More and more big beasts are exiting the club stage. Despite the expectations of many observers, Jurgen Klopp didn't take the Germany job from Nagelsmann after Euro 2024. Instead, he appears to be enjoying the role he started with Red Bull last year as their head of global soccer. When Madrid fired Xabi Alonso last month, Klopp told Servus TV that the news and speculation linking him with the job “triggered nothing in me either”.

Alonso was an exception to president Florentino Perez's fondness for bringing back successful managers, such as Ancelotti and Zidane, for second spells. It's one of the reasons Jose Mourinho is still believed to have another shot at the Bernabeu, regardless of his career trajectory. Few people, for instance, thought Ancelotti would win another two Champions League titles with Madrid when he was at Napoli and Everton, and the same is true of Mourinho now.

After helping Rui Costa win re-election as president of Benfica by agreeing to become their coach last September, Mourinho has a break clause in his contract that allows him to leave 10 days after their final game of the season. If Madrid don't come calling, would it be a surprise if the Portuguese Football Federation asked him to replace Roberto Martinez after the World Cup?

To indulge in a last bit of speculation, Alonso's name continues to be associated with a still-occupied Liverpool bench, but projection does not always manifest into reality. That was the case in 2024 when Alonso decided to stay at Bayer Leverkusen and, who knows, if the World Cup goes badly for Luis de la Fuente, perhaps Alonso would entertain becoming Spain coach. After all, that's what Luis Enrique did in 2018 while still in his forties.

Coaches are often impulsive and unpredictable. They can unexpectedly stay put or get restless in fear of being left on the shelf.

Roberto Mancini wanted back into the Premier League this season. The West Ham United job came up, then the Nottingham Forest one. After holding talks with Forest, he thought twice about it and he's now in charge of Qatari side Al Sadd. If he had held out, maybe he would have appealed to Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur following the dismissals of Ruben Amorim and Thomas Frank, maybe more conversations would have taken place with Forest after Sean Dyche's sacking.

Instead, Spurs have turned to Igor Tudor, at least until the end of the season. If Mancini, who won the Euros as Italy coach in 2021, can be viewed as yesterday's man, what about Roberto De Zerbi? His decision to join Marseille — where he showed a contract offer from Manchester United to his players after a defeat to Auxerre to demonstrate he had put his passion for football before money, the passion his players lacked — took some people by surprise in 2024.

It feels like clubs who will be looking for coaches this summer have fewer established targets and, to complicate matters further, these targets are constantly moving too.

A vacuum is emerging.

Who is going to credibly succeed Guardiola, Klopp, Ancelotti and Mourinho as truly transcendent figures in the way they succeeded the titanic Marcello Lippi, Fabio Capello, Sir Alex Ferguson, Arsene Wenger, Vicente del Bosque and Ottmar Hitzfeld? In the epoch of Guardiola, his principal rivals have been Mourinho and Klopp. His latest is one of his own making: Mikel Arteta.

Six years into Arteta's tenure at Arsenal, he hasn't, for all the progress, won the Premier League, even when it was there for the taking last season. Instead, Liverpool seized the moment. Thursday's 1-1 draw at Brentford meant Arsenal's lead at the top was reduced to four points with 12 games to go. Another former member of Guardiola's coaching staff, Enzo Maresca, was sacked by Chelsea barely six months after winning the UEFA Conference League and Club World Cup. Xavi hasn't worked since Barcelona got rid of him coming up to two years ago, with his 2022-23 league title, the first of their post-Lionel Messi era, almost taken for granted, normalised, forgotten about.

Coaches who seem to be the future very quickly look like the past.

Some would argue Slot is the latest example. Mauricio Pochettino has not enjoyed the career some expected after he led Tottenham to a Champions League final. Maurizio Sarri won trophies at Chelsea and Juventus, but he has not found a group of players who can replicate the football his Napoli team expressed. Andre Villas-Boas switched roles in 2024, becoming president of Porto. Erik ten Hag is the technical director at Twente.

Amorim won Sporting CP's first league title in almost two decades, but as with Ten Hag, he'll be remembered for not restoring Manchester United to greatness. Does that make him a bad coach? No. And yet the noise United generate echoes louder than the work that got him the job in the first place and it is hard, in the short-term, to envision him getting another one in the Premier League.

The troubles Frank and others have experienced in making the step-up within the same league also make you wonder if Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola — who, like Crystal Palace's Oliver Glasner, is set to be out of contract in the summer — would be an automatic success at a ‘bigger' club. The requirements are different. The scrutiny you're exposed to is ever greater. Press conferences attended by only a few journalists all of a sudden take place in auditoriums with international as well as local media present.

Memes of Amorim with a tactics board as United lost at fourth-division Grimsby Town, face-swaps featuring Graham Potter, and Arsenal-branded coffee cups unwittingly in the hands of a Tottenham manager can undermine someone in the time it takes to refresh a timeline. Playing in Europe stresses methodologies that worked well in teams used to only domestic competitions. This is why hiring a coach is the hardest decision a club have to make.

They can look at whether a candidate outperformed a metric such as expected points or his previous team's wage bill and net spend relative to other teams in the league when evaluating a coach. This still isn't enough. Who a club's success is chalked up to is often murky. At Brentford, for instance, was it Frank, as Tottenham seemed to believe, or was it the support structure put in place by an extraordinarily well-run club? Under his replacement Keith Andrews, who had never managed any team before this season, they are seventh in the Premier League and four points off the Champions League places.



At Brighton & Hove Albion, what's more responsible for their consolidation as a Premier League side? Are Chris Hughton, Potter, De Zerbi and Fabian Hurzeler the principal reasons, or is it the analytics and recruitment that even survived the departures of executives such as Dan Ashworth, Paul Winstanley, Sam Jewell and David Weir? Sevilla were, for a time, a highly successful version of this on the continent. Unai Emery won the Europa League three times before having a less successful spell at Arsenal, but it is harder to judge Juande Ramos and Jose Luis Mendilibar outside Seville (even if Ramos was the last Spurs coach to lift a trophy before Ange Postecoglou did it in May).

Take one of these coaches and put them in a more pressurised environment without an equivalent structure or culture and it's hard to expect results. On the flip side, that's also why when a coach is onto a good thing, the grass isn't always greener on the other side. At another club, you might not wield the same power and influence that Diego Simeone has accrued at Atletico Madrid or Arteta with Arsenal.

That some coaches think this way and elect to stick rather than twist only exacerbates the sense that there are fewer and fewer top coaches on the market.

Clubs are also becoming pickier. They want a style at a time when football is in flux and not being beholden to a style is probably for the better. They want coaches to stay in their lane and focus on training sessions, match preparation and player development. They don't want to be challenged, provoked and pushed. They don't want to concede some of the power and influence over recruitment. This serves to make the coaching pool appear even smaller.

Vocal winners such as Antonio Conte, a title-winning coach in two different countries with four different clubs, are ruled out as too much hassle, too short-term, when statistics show the life-cycle of most in the profession is short anyway. De Zerbi has, in the past, brought a scout with him, Salvatore Monaco, to guide on his recruitment likes and dislikes. Cesc Fabregas has an ownership stake in Como and, as such, a say in a range of matters at the club he is coach of. While he wouldn't necessarily expect the same clout elsewhere, he has played under managers — namely, Guardiola and Wenger — who have built clubs in their image.

The biases to work through are many. If you look at the coaches who have recently won the Conference League or Europa League, how many of them — Emery, David Moyes, Mourinho, Gian Piero Gasperini — had been written off or scoffed at? There may be no second acts in American life, as F Scott Fitzgerald wrote, but there are in football. These coaches have aged, but their ideas and approaches are still relevant, no matter the zeitgeist. And yet they are still largely thought of as yesterday's men when tomorrow offers less certainty.

Alonso and Thiago Motta (who lasted nine months at Juventus) struggled in their first big jobs. Cristian Chivu (Inter) and Vincent Kompany (Bayern Munich) haven't — but in Kompany's case, how do you judge his Bundesliga title when Bayern have been German champions in 12 of the past 13 years? Why is he a more compelling candidate for another top job, let's say, than the most recent Italians, Massimiliano Allegri and Simone Inzaghi, to lead Italian teams with fewer resources to two Champions League finals? Would Allegri have wider acclaim if he had accepted the chance to replace Zidane at Madrid instead of returning for a second spell at Juventus? Might Inzaghi's name still be on everyone's lips if his idea of a new challenge abroad was in the Premier League, not the Saudi Pro League with Al Hilal?

Manchester United, Madrid, Tottenham and others will all have to reckon with these dilemmas in the coming months — the perceived scarcity, artificial or not, experience versus potential, the right coach at the wrong time conundrum because of structural issues within the club or the squad. Can they adapt? Should we adapt?

These are tough questions the English FA, for now, don't have to ask.

“There is a possibility that I will be tempted to go back to club football,” Tuchel told reporters. “But not in the next two and a half years.”

Victoria Mboko withdrew from the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships because of a right-elbow injury. Mboko entered Dubai after a run to her second WTA 1000 final at the Qatar TotalEnergies Open in Doha. Barbora Krejcikova also pulled out because of injury, become the eighth withdrawal at the event.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Victoria Mboko has become the next player to pull out of the 2026 Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, citing a right-elbow injury.

In addition, 2023 Dubai champion Barbora Krejcikova, left-thigh injury, also pulled out Monday evening ahead of her second-round match with Amanda Anisimova, who will advance via walkover to the third round to face Janice Tjen.

Mboko, who cracked the top 10 in the PIF WTA Rankings for the first time in her career on Monday, and Krejcikova became the seventh and eighth withdrawals from this year's tournament. Mboko withdrew ahead of her first-round match, while Krejcikova was slated for her second-round match against Anisimova Monday.

Since Krejcikova played in the tournament -- she defeated Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-4, 6-4 in the first round -- a lucky loser could not take her spot.

The Canadian teenager's decision comes after a run to the final at the Qatar TotalEnergies Open in Doha, where she fell to Karolina Muchova. Muchova, who won her first career 1000 event on WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, also pulled out of Dubai because of a change in schedule. 

"It is a lot of matches, and the tournaments are really close to each other, so it's hard to try to manage that," Mboko said after her semifinal win in Qatar when asked about the quick turnaround between Doha and Dubai. "Of course, you want to manage your tournament schedule the best you can.

"From a recovery standpoint and doing good physio, having good fitness and good routines help you kind of last longer in that sense. I'm trying to improve that in a way. We're always focused on it, but I think it's important to also prioritize everything else off court that's not related to tennis."

On Sunday, Krejcikova defeated Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-4, 6-4 in the first round, therefore, not allowing a lucky loser to take her spot as she has played at the tournament.

Among other withdrawals included Maria Sakkari (illness), Zheng Qinwen (illness), Elisabetta Cocciaretto (left-thigh injury), Aryna Sabalenka (right-hip injury) and Iga Swiatek (change of schedule). 

Replacing Mboko will be lucky loser Petra Marcinko, who will face Jaqueline Cristian in the first round Monday evening.

The six other lucky loser alternates have included Antonia Ruzic, Anastasia Zakharova, Peyton Stearns, Magdalena Frech, Kamilla Rakhimova and Hailey Baptiste, the latter of which retired in her first-round match to Alexandra Eala.

Victoria Mboko withdrew from the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships because of a right-elbow injury. Mboko entered Dubai after a run to her second WTA 1000 final at the Qatar TotalEnergies Open in Doha. Barbora Krejcikova also pulled out because of injury, become the eighth withdrawal at the event.

Much has been made about the work Carlos Alcaraz has done on his serve. But the Spaniard is not the only one focusing on the vital stroke. Jannik Sinner revealed on Sunday ahead of the Qatar ExxonMobil Open that he is emphasising his serve ahead of his first ATP 500 event of the season.

“Honestly at the moment [we are working] on the usual stuff. Trying to get a very solid serve at the moment, which is what we work a lot on,” Sinner told ATP Media in Doha. “Also a lot in the gym, the gym sessions are very important. I try to make an extra step forward in that scenario and that's it.”

Sinner is the second seed this week in Doha, where he leads the field alongside the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings Alcaraz. The Italian is competing for the first time since he suffered a semi-final defeat to Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open last month, when he made 75 per cent of his first deliveries and won 80 per cent of those points, according to Infosys Stats.
While the loss was a disappointment, the Italian was keen to stress that the work undertaken in the fortnight since has been building on the foundations laid during the team's pre-season training block in Dubai.
“The season has started. A lot of the work we have done was in the offseason,” Sinner said. “Now of course we try to keep working, but also to maintain the level of fitness, too. I think everything is going quite well. Of course you need to play some matches, trying to have the best feedback.”
That feedback loop, practice intensity translating into match performance, will guide his week in Doha as much as results.
“From my point of view, it also depends how the practice sessions go. If you feel very well there, you want to produce the same intensity also in the match,” Sinner said. “If certain things don't work well in the practice session, you try to be slightly better than in the practice session. So it depends, but at the same time I'm here trying to go as far as possible. At the same time, trying to improve and then see what's working well here.”

Sinner is making his debut at the ATP 500 event in Doha, where he will open against Czech Tomas Machac. The World No. 2, who leads Machac 2-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series, is excited for the week, having enjoyed success in the city in the past.
“Some years ago I won a junior tournament, so it's a very familiar place,” Sinner said. “Obviously a different level now playing the 500 event here. But I'm very excited and let's see what's coming.”
Sinner trails World No. 1 Alcaraz by 2,750 points in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. However, the Italian has no points to defend between now and Rome in May.

After Shelton saved three championship points in spectacular fashion and won it all, he said "I thank God." Is this the start of a changing of the American guard?ByTENNIS.comPublished Feb 16, 2026 copy_link

What separates tennis's Top 2 American men? Judging by the evidence from Dallas on Sunday, very little. A go-for-broke second serve here, an unexpected inside-out backhand there, a possibly-mishit forehand that landed in just the right spot on championship point.Normally, it's the player who maintains a high level for longer who wins a match, and the player who has wilder swings in form who eventually falls short. Not this time. Taylor Fritz won more points than Ben Shelton overall, and kept his game steadier over the course of three sets and nearly two hours. But in the end it was Shelton, after a bleary-eyed start, who pulled off the more surprising and spectacular shots exactly when he needed them.

Normally, it's the player who maintains a high level for longer who wins a match, and the player who has wilder swings in form who eventually falls short. Not this time. Taylor Fritz won more points than Ben Shelton overall, and kept his game steadier over the course of three sets and nearly two hours. But in the end it was Shelton, after a bleary-eyed start, who pulled off the more surprising and spectacular shots exactly when he needed them.

A close contest between these two was always in the cards. Fritz and Shelton came in ranked No. 1 and 2 in the States, and No. 7 and 9 in the world. One of their two previous encounters had gone down to the wire, and their roads to the final here were similarly strenuous. Fritz won two matches in final-set tiebreakers, while Shelton won his quarterfinal 6-4 in the third, and his semi 7-6 in the third. The quick indoor courts in Dallas meant that there would likely be few chances to break. Even the crowd was pretty evenly split between these two home-country favorites.

I tried to be a competitor through and through." Ben Shelton

Fritz got the first punch in right away. He broke in the second game, won his first 28 first-serve points, and ran out a breezy opening set 6-3. He came a point or two away from breaking the second set open as well. Three times Fritz reached 30-30 on Shelton's serve, and twice he had break point, but Shelton dug down and found the serves he needed to stay alive.“Fritz was playing very good tennis and I was struggling a lot with what he was throwing at me,” Shelton said. “I tried to be a competitor through and through.”Finally, at 2-2 in the second, Shelton's ground strokes began to back up his serve. He won another crucial 30-30 point with an inside-out forehand winner that inspired his first serious celebratory yell of the day.  Three games later, with Fritz serving at 3-4, Shelton uncorked a forehand for 0-15, a backhand for 0-30, and a running forehand pass for 0-40. A few minutes later, he had the second set, and the fans had what they wanted—a decider for the title.“Once I get a set, I feel pretty confident,” Shelton said later. “Once I'm able to sink my teeth in and feel like I have some sort of rhythm, I just start to loosen up and find my level.”

“Once I get a set, I feel pretty confident,” Shelton said later. “Once I'm able to sink my teeth in and feel like I have some sort of rhythm, I just start to loosen up and find my level.”

Both men rose to the moment and dueled through one of the best sets of 2026 so far. The rallies were long, but the shots were fast and varied. Each swung for the fences, and went deep into his repertoire. And each was inspired by the other. Shelton broke Fritz at 1-1 with a blazing forehand winner, but Fritz broke right back with a great get and a backwards-leaping smash. Between them, they had 30 aces in the match, and their winner-to-error ratio was a combined plus-24.

“It was a fun match to be a part of, up until the end." Taylor Fritz

For all of that, the conclusion looked like it would be anti-climactic. Serving at 4-5, Shelton made a couple of missteps to go down 15-40. Would a match this good really end in such a straightforward way? No, because Shelton immediately corrected himself, in typically brazen fashion. At 15-40, he threw down a 120-mph second serve, charged the net, and closed with a smash. At 30-40, he shocked Fritz by taking a backhand and, perhaps for the first time all match, smacking it inside out. Fritz could only flail futilely.From there, Shelton wouldn't be stopped. He broke Fritz at 5-5, and went up 40-0 at 6-5. Now it was Fritz's turn to make a miracle last stand, and he was almost pulled it off. He saved the first two match points; on the third, he tracked down a series of big Shelton ground strokes. Finally, a Shelton forehand semi-shanked off his strings and landed short—an inch too short for Fritz to return.“It was a fun match to be a part of, up until the end,” a smirking Fritz said, before praising Shelton for playing “the big points and important moments really well.”As for Shelton, he praised the heavens for seeing him through.

“I thank God, because I needed something supernatural to end up winning this tournament with all the holes that I was in,” he said. “This is one my favorite atmospheres I ever played in.”A great match, and a great atmosphere—but will it end up being more than that? Is Shelton in the process of surpassing Fritz as the best American man? In most cases, I wouldn't read much into a result where the loser had three match points. But this did feel like a significant victory for Shelton. He's five years younger and less experienced than Fritz, who has historically found a way to survive tight matches like this. But here, at the moment of truth, it was Shelton who lifted his game above Fritz's, and showed that he has weapons that his countryman can't easily counter.All in all, it was a fine warm-up for next month's Sunshine Double. Let's hope we don't have to wait long for the rematch.

Australia's Destanee Aiava says she will retire from professional tennis at the close of the 2026 season, and the one-time teenager prodigy is taking no prisoners as she gets set for her last goodbye.Aiava, now 25, wrote a scathing open letter to tennis on social media this week in announcing that this season will be her last. The slammed what she said is a “racist, misogynistic, homophobic and hostile” culture within the sport, and questioned whether the sacrifices she made to become a professional athlete were indeed worth it.Aiava reached a career-high ranking of No. 147 as a 17-year-old in 2017, where she became the first player born after the year 2000 to win a WTA main-draw match when she beat Bethanie Mattek-Sands at that year's Brisbane International. It was a career-altering step into the spotlight, she said, and not for the better. She confessed that she was "unprepared and dangerously naive to the consequences of trusting the wrong people.Read more: Australia's Destanee Aiava slams “weird and hostile” United Cup team experience: a “2 out of 10”"Sometimes I kept playing because I felt like I owed it to not only myself but to everyone who had helped me throughout my career, to try and get back to where (on paper) I belonged," she wrote.

For five years after that, Aiava struggled with her mental health and middling results, and revealed last year that she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder in 2022 after panic attacks and a suicide attempt. She had a brief resurgence during last Australian summer, where she won a match at the Australian Open for the first time, played a dramatic three-set thriller against Danielle Collins, and qualified for the US Open.After rising to No. 148, one spot below her career-high ranking, last spring, Aiava is currently ranked No. 258. She proceeded to give a “ginormous [sic] f--- you” to those she said made her feel “less than," including those who sent her death threats after losing matches, and who made comments online about her body and career.Read more: The story behind every Destanee Aiava throwback kit at Australian Open“Behind the white outfits and traditions is a culture that's racist, misogynistic, homophobic and hostile to anyone who doesn't fit its mould,” Aiava added. “Life is not meant to be lived in misery or half assed.

Robert Duvall, the legendary character actor who specialized in playing rugged, complicated men, died on Sunday. He was 95.


	Duvall's wife, Luciana, confirmed the actor's death in a note shared on Duvall's official Facebook page, writing that Duvall “passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by love and comfort.” A cause of death was not given. 


	“To the world, he was an Academy Award-winning actor, a director, a storyteller,” Luciana wrote. “To me, he was simply everything. His passion for his craft was matched only by his deep love for characters, a great meal, and holding court. For each of his many roles, Bob gave everything to his characters and to the truth of the human spirit they represented. In doing so, he leaves something lasting and unforgettable to us all. Thank you for the years of support you showed Bob and for giving us this time and privacy to celebrate the memories he leaves behind.”


	In a film career that began in the early 1960s, Duvall was a central figure in the New Hollywood of the 1970s, adding grit and soul to legendary works from directors such as George Lucas, Robert Altman, and, most notably, Francis Ford Coppola. An Oscar winner who also proved to be a fine director in his own right — he earned an Academy Award nomination for his lead performance in his superb 1997 drama The Apostle — he lent a steadying presence to movies, proving to be a warm, paternalistic onscreen figure as he grew older. But Duvall was also no-nonsense, refusing to suffer fools and committed to his craft, even if it sometimes caused him to clash with filmmakers. “Directors say actors are difficult to work with — well, what about directors?” he once asked in an Interview profile. “It's our face that goes up there; it's only their name.”

	











	Robert Selden Duvall was born Jan. 5, 1931, raised by a father in the Navy. “We moved a lot because of being in a military family,” he recalled of his childhood. “We lived in San Diego and then Annapolis, Maryland, at the Naval Academy. I remember seeing a movie when I was really young at Camp Pendleton for a dime back in the 1930s, when we lived in Mission Hills in San Diego.” After serving in the Army himself, he studied acting in New York, befriending contemporaries such as Dustin Hoffman and Gene Hackman. “The feeling was that Bobby was the new Brando,” Hoffman later told Vanity Fair. “I felt he was the one, and probably I wasn't.”

	After several years in theater, Duvall got his film break when he was cast as the kindly, misunderstood outsider Boo Radley in the Oscar-winning 1962 adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird. (Horton Foote, who wrote the screenplay based on Harper Lee's novel, and his wife had seen Duvall in a stage production about a year earlier; when casting for the film was underway, they suggested the relative unknown.) From there, he continued collecting supporting parts, including in 1969's The Rain People, a film from a young director named Francis Ford Coppola.


	But Duvall rose to prominence the next decade, first as the ornery Major Frank Burns in the 1970 antiwar comedy M*A*S*H, reuniting with Robert Altman, who'd previously cast him in 1967's Countdown. A year later, he was the imperiled everyman in George Lucas' minimalist dystopian sci-fi drama THX 1138, following it up with The Godfather, where he got to work opposite his hero, Marlon Brando. They'd previously been in the Arthur Penn drama The Chase together, but The Godfather allowed Duvall a chance to spend more time around the venerated actor. His co-star James Caan would “crack a joke and it'd take Brando three seconds to get it,” Duvall recalled in a 2021 interview on NPR. “He was like the godfather of actors. Dustin Hoffman, me, and Gene Hackman used to go to Cromwell's Drugstore a couple of times a week in New York City. And if we mentioned Marlon once, we mentioned him 25 times.”

	Duvall possessed a Brando-like intensity in the Seventies, whether as the coldly strategic Tom Hagen in the Godfather pictures or as Frank Hackett, the soulless, hotheaded executive in Sidney Lumet's bruising satire Network. He could have played the lead in Jaws, but he resisted. “I wanted to play the other part, the one that the guy from England played, Robert Shaw, but I was too young,” he admitted in Interview, later adding, “But I don't feel bad that I turned down the part or the lead, ‘cause I like more character parts.”


	He received his first Oscar nomination for The Godfather, landing his second for playing Kilgore, the surfing and enthusiast and napalm-loving lieutenant colonel in Apocalypse Now. The character was meant to be a critique of America's hawkish behavior in Vietnam, but Duvall the military veteran wanted to be sure he got it right. “The part was overwritten,” he told NPR. “It was a guy who was like a cowboy with boots. And it was a caricature. … So I got with a guy who had been in Vietnam and he told me how to shape it with the Air Cavalry, because I had been in the service in the Army and I knew what special service officers were like. We went from there and formed that.”

	











	Not that Duvall was shy about illustrating the dark side of military service: He earned his first Best Actor Oscar nomination for his role as the abusive, tortured fighter pilot who can't adjust to life away from active duty in The Great Santini. He'd win the Academy Award three years later as Mac Sledge, a drunken, used-up country singer looking for a second chance in Tender Mercies. It was a reunion between him and Foote, whose original screenplay also won the Oscar, and the film found Duvall essaying one of his most delicate turns, playing a difficult man getting in touch with the vulnerability underneath. But Duvall was never one to court sentimentality in his performances. In a 1991 interview, he noted, “Whenever you see documentaries, people are always trying to put a lid on their emotions, going against what's there. That's much more interesting. When you go against it, then the colors will come out. It's a discipline. If you don't cry you'll be rewarded, something else will come out, something nice.”


	Over the next few decades, he cemented his status as the consummate character actor, adding integrity and weathered grace to films like The Natural and Days of Thunder. He played father figures, curmudgeonly editors-in-chief, various law enforcement officers. No matter the role, that toughness was always there, a desire to push against the artificiality of acting to get at something true and lived-in within his characters. Duvall directed four films, the best of the group being The Apostle, a film about faith and redemption which he also wrote and financed. He cast himself as Sonny, a violent Pentecostal preacher who, after putting his wife's lover in a coma, skips town to restart his life in a new community. It's one of the most searing, nuanced performances he ever delivered, demonstrating the paucity of adventurous, idiosyncratic roles for serious actors in Hollywood after the heyday of the 1970s.


	“An actor always looks for challenges, and this was a wonderful challenge, something I felt I could do,” Duvall said in 1997 about The Apostle. “I'm not saying other actors couldn't, but I felt I had a bead on this guy. It was very challenging in a titillating, alive way. I wanted to see if I could recreate the rhythms, the temperament, the whole makeup and aura of the guy. … I didn't wanna come up with an indictment or a critique of these people — I wanted something from their point of view.”

	











	Duvall was honored with two more Oscar nominations in his career — as a lawyer representing a company polluting the environment in A Civil Action and an aging judge in The Judge — but he was just as celebrated for being a champion of younger talents, co-starring in Billy Bob Thornton's breakthrough indie Sling Blade. A new generation of filmmakers like James Gray and Steve McQueen cast him, relishing his connection to a halcyon period in American acting. And although peers such as Hackman eventually decided to hang it up, Duvall steadily kept working. Even so, he knew the day would come when he, too, would have to leave acting behind.


	“I don't know what there is left,” he told GQ in 2014. “There'll be a few left, I don't know. If they keep sending me stuff that's worthwhile. Then, eventually that'll peter out. So retirement will be coming. A part of evolution, natural for you. It'll peter out.”


	Alongside his Oscars, he collected one Emmy, a BAFTA, and three Independent Spirit Awards. His starring role in the 1989 Western miniseries Lonesome Dove is as beloved as any of his many hallowed film roles. He never stopped being opinionated, like when he declared that Stanley Kubrick's pictures contained “the worst performances I've ever seen in movies” in a 2010 Hollywood Reporter roundtable. And he famously refused to appear in The Godfather: Part III because he claimed his old buddy Coppola was lowballing him. (“There are two or three other actors in that film being paid more than I was offered,” he told the Los Angles Times at the time. “That just isn't right. You know how cheap they are.”)

	But that blunt honesty fed into the terse poetry of his acting, accentuating the sense that his characters were utterly authentic, saying what they felt and unwilling to bend in their beliefs. Duvall was never anything less than entirely genuine, never believed that he transformed himself for his roles. He was him.


	“It's like play-acting,” he once said of his profession on NPR's Fresh Air. “Kids play house, right? … We play house as grown-ups. We get paid good money to play house. So it's a game, really. … You become the character, but it's really you turning yourself in a certain way, as if you've become the character. But you cannot lose sight of who and what you are. You have one set of emotions, one psyche, one soul, and you don't become another thing. It's all those things turned to what seems to be something different.”

NY & Broadway Editor


	Oscar-winning actor Robert Duvall, acclaimed for his iconic performances in The Godfather films, Apocalypse Now, Lonesome Dove, Network and many others, died last night at his home in Middleburg, Virginia. He was 95.


	His death was announced by his wife Luciana Duvall.


	“Yesterday we said goodbye to my beloved husband, cherished friend, and one of the greatest actors of our time,” Luciana Duvall said in a Facebook post today. “Bob passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by love and comfort. To the world, he was an Academy Award-winning actor, a director, a storyteller. To me, he was simply everything. His passion for his craft was matched only by his deep love for characters, a great meal, and holding court. For each of his many roles, Bob gave everything to his characters and to the truth of the human spirit they represented. In doing so, he leaves something lasting and unforgettable to us all. Thank you for the years of support you showed Bob and for giving us this time and privacy to celebrate the memories he leaves behind.”

	











	A cause of death was not immediately available, though the initial announcement indicated he died peacefully with his wife by his side.


	With a celebrated career spanning more than six decades, Duvall was a generational performer, breaking into the national consciousness with a brief but haunting 1962 feature film debut as neighborhood recluse Boo Radley in To Kill A Mockingbird and continuing in the immediate following years on television (The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, The Fugitive), theater and, most indelibly, a run of the most significant films of the 1970s and '80s that continued well into the 21st century.

	











	Among the outstanding performances of an outstanding career, Duvall portrayed mob consigliere Tom Hagen in The Godfather and The Godfather Part II, Apocalypse Now‘s Lt. Colonel Kilgore, who loved surfing and “the smell of napalm in the morning” in equal measure , and his Oscar-winning performance as washed-up, alcoholic country singer Mac Sledge in Tender Mercies.


	In Network, he was the ruthless TV exec Frank Hackett, who authorizes the assassination of his anchorman for the crime of low ratings, and in The Great Santini he played the authoritarian family man Lt. Col. “Bull” Meechum.

EXCLUSIVE: Tyrese Gibson (Fast & Furious franchise), Billy Zane (Titanic), Jake Busey (Stranger Things) and Armie Hammer (Call Me By Your Name) are among cast for indie genre-bender Mascotland.


	Writer-director Kerry Mondragon's dark comedy coming-of-age thriller, previously announced as Mascots, has undergone casting changes since it was first announced last year.


	Filming recently began in Los Angeles and surrounding desert. Salomé Breziner produces and cinematographer is Ben Braham Ziryab.


	Zane stars as a disturbed kidnapper whose victims escape into the real world for the first time.

Mexico unveils a series of incentives to support local cinema and attract international productions, just as the Trump government is threatening tariffs.


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	Oscar-nominated Mexican star Salma Hayek Pinault (Frida, Tale of Tales) joined Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo this week to announce a new tax incentive aimed at boosting the local film industry and drawing big production south of the border.


	The incentives include a new 30 percent tax incentive for projects shot in Mexico, making the country more attractive for runaway productions, just as the Trump government is intensifying pressure on U.S. companies to shoot more films at home.




	Hayek attended a presidential briefing where Mexican authorities outlined the incentive, which will apply for live action or animated feature films and TV series episodes that spend a minimum of 40 million pesos ($2.3 million) in country; documentary feature films and series with a minimum expenditure of 20 million pesos ($1.2 million); and animation, visual effects, or post-production processes with a minimum expenditure of 5 million pesos ($290,000).

	The incentive will be for Mexican individuals and legal entities, for foreign individuals and entities with a permanent establishment in the country, and foreign individuals and entities who carry out production through a Mexican resident individual or legal entity.

	President Pardo said the goal of the program was to “meet the level of our people and to match the extraordinary creativity that exists in our country,” noting that Mexican s were “a resilient people who have always fought for their independence, for their sovereignty, and for the defense of their cultural rights.”

	











	Hayek Pinault noted that the incentive supporting Mexican cinema would foster national pride through authentic and meaningful storytelling.


	“With this support, we have no comparison. There is no country in the world with such ecological diversity and beauty—here we have it all. No other country has what we have,” she said..


	The move and Mexico's broader push to grow production infrastructure comes as the Trump government continues to threaten to levy tariffs of up to 100 percent on films produced outside the United States. Trump has repeatedly proposed such tariffs, arguing that foreign subsidies and tax incentives are hurting Hollywood. He has yet to clarify how such system could work, given that films are non-material goods, but the threats have had unsettling effects on both Hollywood and global production hubs. Many have suggested the U.S. instead implement its own federal tax incentives to bring production back home.

The following contains spoilers for Wuthering Heights.

The debate over Emerald Fennell's Wuthering Heights has splintered into two factions that ultimately agree on the facts. Fans of the movie think it delivers style over substance in a good way, while detractors think it prioritizes style over substance in a bad one. But while it's fair to say that Fennell favors flashy sensuality over meaty storytelling, it's not entirely fair to say there's no substance to her candy-colored, Charli xcx-soundtracked riff on Emily Brontë's classic novel. In fact, there's actually an underappreciated core to Fennell's loose adaptation. Her Wuthering Heights may market itself as a dark and steamy Valentine's Day romance, but at its heart it's actually a story of childhood trauma bonds run amok. 

It's a theme that emerges thanks to one of the bigger changes Fennell makes to her exploration of the doomed love story between Cathy Earnshaw (Margot Robbie) and Heathcliff (Jacob Elordi). In the novel, Cathy's father is a minor supporting character who adopts an orphaned Heathcliff as his favorite child but then dies relatively early into the story. It's then Cathy's older brother Hindley (a character the film cuts entirely) who inherits the Wuthering Heights estate and proceeds to jealously mistreat Heathcliff—forcing him to live and work as a servant, thus setting up the class/social stratification that keeps Cathy and Heathcliff apart. 

In the movie, however, we simply have Cathy's alcoholic father Mr. Earnshaw (Martin Clunes), who brings Heathcliff home to save him, but then proceeds to mistreat him as well. That simple act of character condensing shifts the entire story. While Brontë's Wuthering Heights begins with a stable family that's slowly corrupted by jealousy and grief, Fennell begins with a version that's hollow from the start. Instead of a big house with characters coming and going, Wuthering Heights is more like an island prison lorded over by a capricious man who seems to be collecting children he can keep under his thumb—including Cathy's servant-companion Nelly (Hong Chau), whom Fennell reimagines as the illegitimate daughter of a nobleman.

From the first moments we meet young Cathy (Charlotte Mellington) and Nelly (Vy Nguyen), it's clear that Wuthering Heights isn't a safe place to grow up. Both girls know they have to carefully manage their emotions so as not to set off Mr. Earnshaw's temper. And without any kind of positive parental figure in their life, they've both developed maladaptive personalities. Cathy is self-centered and melodramatic, while Nelly is tumultuously infatuated with her impulsive mistress, who has all the privilege Nelly's been denied access to. Both girls build their emotional worlds around Cathy, forging a codependent bond that helps them weather the storm of Mr. Earnshaw's drunken fits of rage.

Once young Heathcliff (Owen Cooper) enters the story, however, that bond gets upended. Cathy shifts her melodramatic yearning to a more conventionally romantic figure, while young Heathcliff is inspired to take his protective instincts to self-sacrificial levels because it so clearly fuels Cathy's love of drama and angst. Nelly, meanwhile, is left seething with jealousy over how Heathcliff has supplanted her role in Cathy's life. All the love they're denied from their father figure gets transposed onto one another in increasingly thorny, complex, psychosexual ways. Or, as grown-up Cathy screams at her dad when he complains about being ill, “We are all ill because of you!”

It's a sentiment Fennell captures with equal parts satire and horror. While Fennell has sympathy for Cathy as a victim, she also has a keen eye for how hilariously petulant and annoying she can be. Her arrested development is cause for a whole lot of unnecessary drama in its own way. Meanwhile, horror touches—like a scene where Heathcliff yanks Cathy under a bed like a 1980s horror villain—subvert the film's romantic tone. Though there is something sweet and genuine going on between Heathcliff and Cathy, it stems from a place of survival as much as anything else. They have no one around to save them but themselves.

This fuels Fennell's pointed critique of the patriarchal forces that undergird upper-class British nobility in the 18th century. Because a landed man is considered the highest authority, there's no social or child protective services to call when he's misusing that power. Instead, his staff and family must simply bend to his various whims and power plays. Wuthering Heights deploys a lot of dollhouse imagery, and Cathy, Heathcliff, and Nelly might as well be dolls Mr. Earnshaw is playing with as he shouts “I am the kindest man alive!” into the void. 

It's an idea Brontë explores too, although in a very different place in the novel. In Brontë's original story, the saga continues on after Cathy's death with a second generation of characters who find themselves living under Heathcliff's isolated, abusive thumb. Hindley's strapping heir, Cathy's strong-willed daughter, and Heathcliff's own sickly son are left to build complicated bonds with one another while Heathcliff lures them all to Wuthering Heights and tries his best to emotionally destroy their lives as revenge for his own suffering.

While Fennell—like most Wuthering Heights adaptors—cuts that part of the story, she intentionally folds some of its themes into her streamlined adaptation. Though she reimagines Heathcliff as a far kinder, more sympathetic figure than he is in the novel, her dark take on Mr. Earnshaw gets at some of the patriarchal abuse that Brontë is interested in too. It's like Fennell has collapsed the two generations into her Cathy/Heathcliff/Nelly dynamic, which is a clever way to engage with the novel's core ideas without adapting its plot beat-for-beat. 

It's a shame, then, that after such a strong start, Fennell's ideas lose steam in the film's second half. More than anything, Wuthering Heights is a movie about three codependent people who are absolutely terrified of the idea of getting left behind. And Fennell's exploration of Cathy, Heathcliff, and Nelly's fraught bond reaches its climax in a scene where Nelly actively manipulates a miscommunication between her “siblings.” In the novel, Heathcliff accidentally overhears Cathy say she could never marry him. In the movie, however, Nelly intentionally provokes Cathy's confession once she realizes Heathcliff is listening outside the door. She blows up Cathy and Heathcliff's love, just as she felt her love for Cathy was blown up by Heathcliff. 

After that, Fennell seems less sure what to do with the themes she's set up. Once Cathy marries her neighbor Edgar Linton (Shazad Latif) and Heathcliff disappears and returns a rich, dashing man, Wuthering Heights devolves into a style-over-substance fantasia. There are fun montages showing off the over-the-top production design of the Linton family home and some “provocative” adaptation changes—like making Heathcliff's relationship with Isabella Linton (Alison Oliver) a consensual BDSM one, rather than an abusive marriage. But because Fennell has frontloaded all the interesting emotional drama into the first half of the movie, there's nowhere for her characters to go as Cathy and Heathcliff finally start consummating their relationship.

There are still sharp moments here and there, like when Cathy tells Nelly, “You like to see me cry,” and Nelly counters, “Not half as much as you like crying.” Or the way Cathy responds to her father's eventual death with both grief and violent relief. Fennell effectively renders her central trio as people too stunted by their childhood traumas to ever really mature into adulthood. But in the rush to make Wuthering Heights a sexy, smutty, earnest romance, Fennell's spikier themes fall by the wayside. Nelly is positioned as the ultimate tragic antihero, given that her vengeful meddling in Cathy's life results in Cathy's death. But the film doesn't care about the character enough to make that twist land. Instead, Wuthering Heights devolves into a more basic Romeo And Juliet-style tragedy. 

Still, there's something to Fennell's adaptation. In some ways, it's a soft choice to make Heathcliff a more sympathetic romantic lead rather than the complicated, cruel figure he is in the novel. But given that Brontë ultimately ends with a sense of hope about children being able to break the cycles of abuse set by their parents, amping up Mr. Earnshaw as an antagonist and giving that hopeful arc to Heathcliff instead still (sort of) tracks with what the novel is trying to explore. That alone won't please the Brontë purists, but it does prove that Fennell's flexible reimagining is more than its quotation marks.

	Former President Barack Obama sat down with influencer Brian Tyler Cohen for a friendly conversation that centered on the political divisions roiling the country, but there was one exchange that seemed to unite disparate factions, at least temporarily, in a shared excitement: the moment Obama seemed to confirm the existence of aliens. 


	“Are aliens real?” Cohen asked the former president point-blank.


	“They're real,” Obama replied, before adding, “But I haven't seen them and they're not being kept in Area 51. There is no underground facility. Unless there is this enormous conspiracy, and they hid it from the president of the United States.” 


	The former president went on to joke that the first question he wanted answered when he became president was “Where are the aliens?”


	The YouTube video of the one-on-one conversation has attracted more than 4 million views since it was posted on Saturday. 


	Obama posted the alien clip to his own Instagram account on Sunday evening, but tamped down enthusiasm for his comments in the caption. 

	











	“I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it's gotten attention let me clarify. Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there,” the former president wrote. “But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we've been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”


	Obama's view on the possibility of extraterrestrial existence has, with developments in astronomy, become the scientific consensus.

	As the journalist Garret M. Graff, author of UFO: The Inside Story of the US Government's Search for Alien Life Here—and Out There, reported for Rolling Stone, advances in technology have helped scientists put a figure to the number of habitable planets — planets with the conditions to support life as we recognize it — in the universe. Current estimates hover around one sextillion such planets or one billion trillions. 

	











	With those numbers, the odds are heavily in favor of the possibility that life is out there — just very far away. The absolute closest galaxy to ours, the Andromeda Galaxy, is roughly 2.5 million lightyears away; the 100,000 galaxies that make up our next closest neighbors exist in a “cosmic suburb” that spans roughly 520 million lightyears of outer space. As Graff wrote, “The math may very well be on the side of the aliens existing, but that's largely because the math of the universe itself turns out to be astounding.”

Maya Hawke's husband, Christian Lee Hutson, is her partner in music — and in life.

The “Stranger Things” star were friends and collaborators long before going public with their romance in 2023.

While Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman's daughter has primarily kept her relationship private, she did gush about her fellow musician on “The Zach Sang Show” in 2024.

“I cannot recommend highly enough dating your friends,” she said at the time. “They really know you as a person who has feelings … not just a piece of paper for them to project their image of [the] perfect girlfriend onto. It's the best to feel seen in that way.”

The pair tied the knot on Valentine's Day in 2026 in New York City, with Maya's parents and “Stranger Things” co-stars in attendance at St George's Episcopal Church.

Hutson was born in Kansas City, Miss., relocating to California at age 5 when his mother remarried.

The family lived in Santa Monica, according to Hutson's May 2020 Under the Radar profile, and he attended a fundamentalist Christian elementary school.

When Hutson's mom tried to make him a “well-rounded student” with guitar lessons at 12, her plan “backfired” because he “became so obsessed with playing guitar that [he] started failing all of [his] classes and dropped out of school altogether three years later.”

Hutson is a singer-songwriter who started his musical career as a Driftwood Singers member between 2010 and 2013.

Since breaking out as a solo artist, he has released five albums, three of which — “Beginners,” “Quitters” and “Paradise Pop” — were co-produced by Phoebe Bridgers.

Hutson opened for Bridgers on tour between 2022 and 2023.

Hutson promotes his music via Instagram — and his first three posts are 2024 tributes to his collaboration with Maya on her “Chaos Angel” record.

He called the “Little Women” star “an unstoppable force” in one upload.

He gushed, “[She is] truly one of the only people I've ever met with the courage to pull the deepest and darkest from within herself out into the light, to hold it there, really examine it, and choose to love it, chaos and all.”

Prior to his romance with Maya, Hutson was married to fellow singer Sharon Silva.

It remains unclear when the former couple divorced.

Silva, however, praised Hutson in a 2015 Instagram post, writing, “I am so proud of you. 💐💛”

Maya and Hutson were spotted kissing in 2023, one year after working together on her “Moss” album.

Hutson referred to the “Fear Street” star as his “fiancée” on the “SoCal Sound” in March 2025, with Maya subsequently photographed rocking a diamond ring on that finger.

She and Hutson made their red carpet debut in April 2025 and wed on Valentine's Day the following year.

Hallmark star Julie Gonzalo shared a beautiful photo on February 14, 2026, as she awaits the arrival of her second child with “When Calls The Heart” star Chris McNally. In the pic, Gonzalo cradled her baby bump, looking at peace as the sun glowed behind her. 

Gonzalo, 44, wrote in the caption, “Happy Valentines Day ❤️ Almost complete. We can't wait to meet you little one, so so soon…” and signed it from “Dad, mom and big sister xx”

Many of Gonzalo and McNally's Hallmark friends commented on her rare post, including WCTH series lead Erin Krakow, who's also expecting. She gushed, “Most stunning photo of you ever ever ever.”

Fellow WCTH star Andrea Brooks chimed in, “Most beautiful mama!!!! 😍😍😍😍 I heart you guys!”

Gonzalo's “Cut, Color, Murder” co-star Ryan McPartlin left a red heart emoji and “Time for Me to Come Home for Christmas” Josh Henderson — who also co-starred with Gonzalo in the 2012 “Dallas” reboot, wrote, “Ohhhhh my goodness ❤️😍🙏🏽”

Fans were equally smitten with Gonzalo's post, including someone who wrote, “❤️❤️ so awesome Julie. thank you for sharing you are so kind to share such a beautiful time and private moment in your life. 💕”

Another commented, “Blessings to your family 🥰. You look beautiful momma.”

Although the last photo on Gonzalo's Instagram account is from 2024, this isn't the first time she's shared a pic of her baby bump. On February 6, the “Pumpkin Pie Wars” star posted before-and-after pics on X (formerly known as Twitter) of her in a bathroom mirror, first when she was newly pregnant and second with her growing baby bump. 

Gonzalo tweeted with the pics, “New year, New life.. we can't wait to meet you. Dad, mom and big sister xx How it started vs. how it's going”

Gonzalo, who last appeared in 2025's “My Argentine Heart,” noted in her caption that the photo was taken by “CWM,” which are McNally's initials. The couple, who starred together in 2023's “3 Bed, 2 Bath, 1 Ghost,” already share a daughter, who will turn four in June. 

McNally announced their happy news during a panel at the Hallmark Christmas Experience in December, pulling a series of ultrasound images out of his pocket. 

Joking that it must have been something in the on-set catering, he revealed that their due date is within six weeks of two other WCTH couples currently expecting. In November, Erin Krakow and Ben Rosenbaum announced their pregnancy less than two weeks after Kevin McGarry and Kayla Wallace did the same.

A moving tableau vivant of a few years in the lives of a fractured but ultimately compassionate Singaporean working-class family, filmmaker Anthony Chen (“Ilo Ilo,” “Wet Season”) returns with a fifth feature that's as emotionally generous as it is frothily melodramatic — in ways that are addictively entertaining, frustrating, and ultimately too empathetic to shun. We know what cold feels like at a festival like Berlin, replete with arch, chilly European exercises in nihilism; it's a cold that invites us to appreciate the sheer warmth of Chen's touch, with the first Singaporean film ever to play in the event's main competition.

In the aptly titled “We Are All Strangers,” Chen introduces us early on to a cook, a bartender, a schoolgirl, and her classmate, a newbie army conscript — all of whom emerge as both found and literal family in this overflowingly emotional saga. The arthouse references might sound arcane, but this is Chen's most accessible and borderline commercial effort to date.

Here is a Singapore where live-streaming medical supply sales and unregulated social media ecommerce are a means of living, where Hokkien noodles are not only a delicious, chewy recipe at every food stand, but also a way of survival. Where military service is compulsory, and may only disappoint our best or even worst men, but can be interrupted, thank god, by life's hairpin turns.

Boon Kiat (Andi Lim, a gentle performance with a light touch) has for years run a noodle stand in the bustling Singapore capital city, serving up wok-fried prawns to daytime and late-night customers. At the stand to his left, Bee Hwa (Chen regular Yeo Yann Yann, disarmingly funny and wounding often in the same scene) serves beer to drunken patrons, working for tips while living with her brother and his small child. Zooming out, Boon Kiat's son Junyang (Koh Jia Ler, now more than 10 years older than he was in “Ilo Ilo”) is headed for life in the Singapore army even as his girlfriend Lydia (Regene Lim) must watch him go. Until she receives some unexpected news that you could predict from the logline, which sends the rest of the movie into motion.

While Junyang and Lydia's relationship curdles under the weight of adult responsibility, Boon Kiat and Bee Hwa strike up a romance late in life. One night, she's beyond hammered, and he walks with her to her home, and then later proposes a sweet date on the bus ride during her commute. Chen's openhearted movie makes great use of the Singapore setting, showing for example, how with a public transportation meet-cute, a connection with someone can bend the structure of your environment around you. Bee Hwa, of course, eventually becomes Junyang's stepmother, which is how we learn that both he and Lydia come from single-parent families where the other parent has been missing (for different, pained reasons) for a long time. “We Are All Strangers” keeps driving back toward this point about found family, which are often the people right in front of you.

 










Boon Kiat, Bee Hwa, Junyang, and Lydia are soon all shacked up in a cramped flat with only one bathroom, and barely a partition to separate other people from your business. And so the harsher realities of life start to float inward, though early on, Chen punctuates the anticipation of possible misery with a glorious sequence that turns out to be a fantasy: Junyang imagines being in a luxury hotel with Lydia, her family credit card footing the bill, a weekend of dancing and swimming ahead of them. It's the reprieve before the storm of grown-up demands about to inundate Junyang like a firehose burst. Who will pay for this tiny apartment? “Some people are terrible husbands, but at least they're better fathers,” Lydia tells him during a moment of particularly sharpened crisis. 

“We Are All Strangers” caps a “growing up” trilogy Chen started with “Ilo Ilo” and “Wet Season.” When the characters are forced to grow up, and the circumstances grow increasingly tragic, is when the melodrama starts to bubble up at its sudsiest. Shot by cinematographer Teoh Gay Hian with a straightforward eye for the refreshingly well-lit, the movie suddenly takes a hard right into the realm of the crime drama!

Due to yet another life change, Junyang and Bee Hwa must stoop to — well, it feels low at first, until then it becomes quite a giddy high — peddling over-the-border OTC medicine on social media, Bee Hwa baiting live-streamers with her life story. And with multiple fake tears placed in the eye just out of frame. There's, in fact, a lot of narrative chaos in the movie's last third, from a pyramid scheme that ruins Junyang's professional ego to the fact that Lydia, once she's given birth, is basically cut out of the picture. But Chen keeps it moving smoothly, even as the film teeters on the edge of sentimentality — but why shouldn't it? In the end, we realize, “We Are All Strangers” is dedicated to the filmmaker's family.

 










The takeaways here, other than this movie should play very well around the world and could even emerge as Singapore's Oscar contender, include that among the converging and careening characters, Yeo Yann Yann is the heart of “We Are All Strangers.” She's a woman desperate for a connection she doesn't realize she wants, and then must take command of a family as a stepmother and caretaker to a frankly lazy, entitled kid (who does eventually grow up). She is the centerpiece beacon of hope in a movie with no shortage of it. 

The class issues in Singapore that Chen aims to characterize and critique mostly come at us from a bird's-eye view, with a deeper interest in characters and their truth and feelings. Once the film hurtles off the cliff into an underworld crime drama of loan sharks and unpaid debts, you yearn for the simpler times before. Just as Junyang may be holding onto that earlier vision of a gleaming hotel. But this is a wholehearted, emotional rush of a movie that holds you in the palm of its hand throughout.

“We Are All Strangers” premiered at the 2026 Berlin Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Devin Booker isn't a Bad Bunny fan.

The Phoenix Suns player revealed during a press conference, which went viral over the weekend, that he “didn't watch” his on-again, off-again girlfriend Kendall Jenner's ex-boyfriend‘s Super Bowl 2026 halftime show.

The athlete, 29, noted that he was just being “completely honest.”

He went on to correct the reporter who asked “for the fans of Puerto Rico” how it “felt to be a part of” Bad Bunny's milestone, clarifying, “I'm Mexican.”

Reps for Booker, Jenner and Bad Bunny did not immediately respond to Page Six's requests for comment.

Booker began dating Jenner, 30, in 2020, with the former couple breaking up and reuniting before calling it quits for good in 2022.

The “Kardashians” star moved on with Bad Bunny, whom she also dated on and off.

In 2023, social media users speculated that Bad Bunny threw shade at Booker in Eladio Carrion's “Coco Chanel.”

The lyrics, translated from Spanish, read, “I'm not bad baby, that's a gimmick / But the Puerto Rico sun in warmer than the one in Phoenix.”

Booker seemingly clapped back via Instagram at the time, writing, “He's worried about another man again.”

The NBA star and Jenner set tongues wagging in January with a flirty online exchange about the reality star's “Kardashian Curse” Super Bowl LX commercial.

“I bet a million the Seahawks get that ring before you do @kendalljenner 🤗,” Booker commented on the footage.

When Jenner replied by asking, “@dbook 🙄 how's the ankle?” he requested she “come rub it.”

The model attended the NFL championship game the following month, alongside BFF Hailey Bieber.

The duo was filmed holding hands during Bad Bunny's record-breaking performance on Feb. 8 as Jenner awkwardly swayed from side to side.

When it comes to folk horror, the Brits stand in a class of their own; a Wicker Man-like figurehead for the subgenre. Japan, though, with plenty of tales of strange yōkai spirits, is not far behind. So it isn't quite as sacrilegious as it might seem that one of the greatest Japanese folk horror films of the '60s, Onibaba, got an English-language, English-set remake in the form of filmmaker Natasha Kermani's The Dreadful. It could work, on paper. The change of setting and culture could even be to The Dreadful‘s benefit if it only engaged with them specifically. Instead, a too-modern sensibility and a drastic change from the original folktale lead the movie dreadfully astray. 

Sophie Turner stars as Anne, a young commoner in 15th-century England. The War Of The Roses has called her husband, Seamus, off to war, so Anne is living with her mother-in-law, Morwen (Marcia Gay Harden). It's a meager existence scraping together a paltry amount of potatoes for dinner, but the pair have faith that he'll return safe and sound. So, when a childhood friend who went off to war with Seamus returns without him, informing the women that the man who connected them has died, it throws their relationship into question. It's a Game Of Thrones reunion, as Kit Harington plays the returning Jago, and it's clear he has eyes for Anne. She might feel the same way, but she worries about abandoning Morwen to her own fate. She's also scared of Morwen and the increasingly drastic measures she's taking to help them survive. And that's not even mentioning the knight, clad head-to-toe in imposing armor, who she's spotted lurking in the woods around their cabin. 

Turner and Harington have a natural chemistry together, despite playing lovers after spending so long playing siblings. (Though if ever there was a show where qualms about incest were unfounded, it'd be that one.) Harrington's Jago is really just a wedge getting between Anne and Morwen, the crucial relationship in the tale. But there, the chemistry is off. Turner feels too innately savvy to be in the situation necessary for this strange dynamic to truly be effective. Turner reads as a protagonist with her own agency and destiny rather than a woman caught between impossible circumstances of the personal and supernatural sort. Harden has something of the opposite problem; she admirably embodies the look of a peasant woman worn down by the struggles of life and loss, but her Morwen is too sinister from the jump as she plots to keep Anne in her life. Morwen skips right past jealousy (a juicy and potentially carnal dynamic) right to hardened hatred. The trio of characters seem fully aware of their roles in this story instead of being opportunistic people struggling and scheming in a strange, cruel world. 

The end of The Dreadful, involving Morwen's encounter with the eerie knight as she attempts to use the frightening helm to intimidate Anne, is drastically different from the end of Onibaba, to the point where it verges on giving Anne a “girl boss” moment. It's a fatally modern pivot for a folk horror reinvention. But to that end, The Dreadful doesn't feel especially folky or especially horrific despite the obligatory overhead shots of foggy fields and occasional dream-sequence scares—a familiar crutch for horror movies, and a sign that Kermani knows her film's atmospheric haunts aren't enough to sustain it.

The Dreadful isn't openly billing itself as an Onibaba remake, though Turner has described it as such in interviews. In any case, it's an especially egregious missed opportunity. Willem Dafoe counts Kaneto Shindō's 1964 horror as one of his favorite films, and during a visit to the Criterion Closet, he explained that he'd once acquired the rights in the hopes of remaking it. However, he eventually decided against it, understanding that Onibaba was “so specific to its time.” Yet, watching The Dreadful, it doesn't seem like Onibaba is unadaptable so much as The Dreadful fails to rise to the challenge.

Part of that comes down to the look of the two pictures. Onibaba is shot in black and white, in a seemingly endless field of swamp grass; the monochrome lending the tall reeds a sense of nightmarish unreality. The samurai's Hannya mask is one of the most distinctive and effective horror props in the entire genre. The characters are sweaty and often half-dressed, making them seem like flesh-and-blood people navigating this dark place. The Dreadful, meanwhile, has Julia Swain's crisp color cinematography without any sense of mood or mystery, a comparatively bland knight's helmet, and layers of drab clothes. 

Some of this difference is the unavoidable consequence of being set in England rather than Japan, but The Dreadful doesn't take advantage of this rich setting either, as so many British folk horror movies have. The Dreadful‘s most interesting adaptive choice—and the one thing that could potentially tap into the specifics of its new locale—is Anne and Morwen's relationship with the Christian church. Sadly, even that's more of a feint than an actual exploration; The Dreadful doesn't explore much of anything. Far from a new take on a classic, it's a middling stab at a genre without a sense of connection with the land, the people who live on it, or the unknown things looming inside it.

					By Diana Lodderhose 

International Features Editor


Oliver Berben refuses to be stuck in the past. When the longtime Constantin Film exec stepped into the role of CEO nearly two years ago, he had a clear vision of how he wanted to steer the German production-distribution powerhouse to the next frontier and embrace indie-style fearlessness while building on the company's 75-year-legacy. 


	“The market has been changing rapidly, and I want creatives to see that we are a place where their visions can come to life,” Berben says. “We consider filmmakers as an IP. Besides existing videogame, book or comic IPs, the biggest creative power you can have is a triple-A filmmaker and a package that combines those filmmakers with great cast and great ideas – that's what we are aiming for.”

	This motto is exemplified in the company's most recent release, Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die, which sees Rango Oscar-winner Gore Verbinski return to the big screen for the first time in a decade. Briarcliff released the AI comedy this past weekend, where it opened to a $3.6M 3-day tally across 1,610 theatres. (Deadline's Anthony D'Alessandro says it was “an almost near topple of Briarcliff's record opener Honest Thief, from 2020″). On September 18, Sony will release Zach Cregger's version of Constantin's prize IP Resident Evil, which is set to be a “complete new set up” of the franchise. Cregger is the writer-director behind $270M global hit Weapons. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	When Deadline speaks to Berben, Constantin Film is coming off the back of a banner 2025 in cinema: It produced and financed the $30M Josh Boone-directed romance Regretting You, an adaptation of Colleen Hoover's book of the same name. Paramount released the project in the U.S. while Constantin handled distribution for all German-speaking territories. The Allison Williams and Dave Franco starrer ended up hitting $48.9M at the domestic box office and $90.5M globally. 


	In Germany, the company had the biggest movie of 2025 with comedy Manitou's Canoe, a sequel to 2001 hit Manitou's Shoe. That title amassed more than five million admissions in Germany and earned €50.9M at the box office, which saw Constantin close the year as the biggest indie distributor of the year and fifth place overall. 

	











	“It's a sign that the audience is there and you just need to make the movies or shows that they really want to see,” says Berben. “It's not just cinema – it's streaming and traditional TV too – they have all evolved into something different. The data of where the audience is and what they want is right here in front of us and we're focusing on exactly that. 


	“If you get the right product to right people, they will embrace it. The only thing that has changed is that you cannot rely on the same ideas and patterns you used to release movies 10 years ago. The sooner people accept that, the better.” 


Filmmakers as ‘IP'


	Last Friday saw the European premiere of Verbinski's Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die at Berlinale. Constantin developed, produced and financed the project – Verbinski's first indie film – with Briarcliff taking U.S. domestic rights and Constantin distributing in Germany, Austria and Swizerland. 


	At the EFM this year, its frequent collaborator north.five.six brought three Constantin projects to market: Supernatural thriller Siamese Dream, which sees Constantin reteam with Boone; an adaptation of Cecelia Ahern's novel If You Could See Me Now from director Peter Segal; and a screen adaptation of Jennifer Archer's YA Into the Deep from director Jonathan Wright.


	It's currently in edit for Cregger's Resident Evil, which Berben says is “far away from everything that is connected to Resident Evil, only because Zach Cregger has his own style.” 


	Additionally, Constantin recently produced survival horror feature Boiúna: Legend of the Amazon (aka Titan) starring Logan Marshall-Green, Jessica Rothe and Kiana Madeira. Lionsgate will release the film in the U.S. later this year. 


	For Berben, this slate is reflective of how he's trying to reshape Constantin for the next generation.  “We have changed a lot on the creative side,” he admits, stressing that Constantin has been actively positioning itself to the international market as creative producers and not just financiers. 


	“We have strengthened the connections to the creative community in Germany. We are creating paths for new ideas and new creatives to enter the scene and providing them with the groundwork to grow and hopefully be successful in the coming years.” 


	He continues: “Our approach on the international front has undergone significant transformation. Over the past decade at Constantin Film, we often worked with the same group of creatives, albeit bringing fresh concepts each time. Now, however, we have fully broadened our horizons and opened our doors to new creative talent and ideas from across the globe.” 


Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die, he says, is a prime example of this. The film, which was set up out of Constantin's L.A. outpost headed up by Robert Kulzer and Pam Kunath, is Verbinski's first independent movie after studio films such as Pirates of the Caribbean films and The Lone Ranger. The film stars Sam Rockwell alongside Haley Lu Richardson, Michael Peña, Zazie Beetz and Juno Temple. It follows a man claiming to be from the future who takes the patrons of an iconic L.A. diner hostage in search of unlikely recruits in a quest to save the world against a rogue AI. 

	











	The film world premiered at Fantastic Fest, an idea driven by Briarcliff head Tom Oretenberg. “I love working with people who have these bold, new ideas of getting into this new market, which now looks completely different,” says Berben. “This movie has laid the groundwork for where we want to go on the international side – stronger filmmakers with bolder ideas. We want to be the place in the independent market for ‘Triple A' filmmakers.” 


	When it came to entrusting Constantin's prize IP Resident Evil with a new voice, Berben admits it was a no-brainer to give Cregger “the carte blanche to do whatever he wanted to do with that IP.” 


	“With Resident Evil, we have had an incredible journey with one of the most successful international IPs of more than a billion dollars in box office for many years and now we are creating something new, not just a new story idea, but to allow a new generation to take the IP into their own hands and form something different.”  


International opportunity


	Berben says that the goal for growth in the U.S. and international markets is built upon its strong foundations in Germany. The company has frequently collaborated with “wide and diverse” directors like David Wnendt and Michael “Bully” Herbig on its home turf. “We transferred that to the international market,” he says.


	“The opportunity for us in the U.S. is unique. We have an advantage because we are coming with the territories already. We'll make things work. We can give filmmakers the opportunity to finally make their movies.”  


	He continues: “We can't provide every budget that is possible, but we can come in with a strong international element on the table. We're not trying to feed the machine, and we are very open in embracing working with third-party producers, doing more co-productions and getting involved with creative communities outside of our own. This is the most important to evolve. We have great producers out there and we offer them the possibility to create and to do what they want to do, because in some ways they might know better than we do.” 


	Berben has been steadily building a team that he says are integral to championing new voices, notably empowering a younger generation of film and television employees who contribute heavily to the decision-making process across the board. 


	“Now we have a bigger team discussing and greenlighting our ideas,” he says. “It's important to include that next generation in the process but it's even more important to let them lead it.” 


	Most recently, Constantin hired Eric Lehmann as its Chief Technology Officer. He's responsible for building the group's AI function and steering the strategic development and deployment of new AI applications across production and distribution. 


	“We're working with many different kinds of AI tools,” Berben says. “Some of them will work, some of them won't. But we are learning very quickly. The important thing is not to be the first but the best mover. You have to be open for everything, but it doesn't mean you have to do everything.”

The pop star will craft a wide-ranging line-up of music, art and performance for the London event.

	Sophie Williams



Harry Styles is set to helm one of the U.K.'s most storied live music events this summer.


	The global superstar has been announced as curator of Meltdown Festival for 2026, which will see him craft an eclectic bill of music, art and workshops across 11 days (June 11-21). The full line-up of performers and activations is expected to arrive in the spring. 


	Now in its 31st edition, Meltdown Festival is held annually at London's Southbank Centre and is billed as “the world's longest-running artist-curated music festival.” The multi-arts event spans the venue's entire site, which comprises multiple performance spaces and galleries.

	Styles joins a prestigious list of previous curators including David Bowie, Yoko Ono, Patti Smith, The Cure's Robert Smith, David Byrne, Grace Jones, Nick Cave, Jarvis Cocker and most recently, Little Simz. 

	











	In addition to crafting the lineup, Styles is set to headline a marquee gig for Meltdown Festival at Southbank Centre's Royal Festival Hall, for which further details are set to be announced.


	In a statement, the singer said: “I'm deeply honoured to curate the Meltdown Festival, especially for the Southbank Centre's 75th anniversary year. My goal as the curator is to share the music and art that I love, and to celebrate the rich history of the venue. 




	“We both share a passionate belief that music is a vital part of life. It brings us together and the Southbank Centre has been at the heart of it, providing easy access to great music for the past 75 years. I'm incredibly grateful to Southbank for having me, it's really exciting for me to have this opportunity in such an iconic venue.”


Jane Beese, head of contemporary music at the Southbank Centre, added: “It's a real privilege to welcome an artist with the cultural impact and presence of Harry Styles as curator of Meltdown in our 75th anniversary year at the Southbank Centre. His openness, warmth and instinct for collaboration feel perfectly aligned with the spirit at the heart of the festival.


	“We're excited to see Styles' vision play out across the whole site, creating space for connection, discovery and joy, and inviting audiences into a Meltdown that reflects the breadth, playfulness and generosity of his artistic world.”


	According to a press release, Styles is expected to draw from a “broad palette of influences” for the line-up, from pop, soul, electronic and rock acts to emerging young British talent. The 2026 bill will also feature free public events designed to engage younger audiences.


	Last year's edition of Meltdown featured a wide-ranging mix of established and emerging artists, from The Streets to Jon Batiste and sets from R&B, jazz and pop talents including Mahalia and Lola Young, with curator Little Simz closing the festival alongside the Chineke! Orchestra.


	Styles' fourth studio album, Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally., is set for a March 6 release. His 2026 Together, Together tour is set to span seven major global cities and over 50 shows, including 30 nights at Madison Square Garden this fall.

TikTok-owner ByteDance has promised to improve “safeguards” on its Seedance 2.0 AI model after a full-throated backlash from Hollywood about copyright theft.


	In a statement shared with Deadline, ByteDance said it would work to prevent users from generating videos based on Hollywood intellectual property.


	ByteDance's statement follows the Chinese tech giant receiving cease and desist letters from Disney and Paramount, calling for an immediate halt to IP plundering.


Disney accused ByteDance of stocking its Seedance 2.0 “with a pirated library of Disney's copyrighted characters.” Paramount said the AI model had produced “vivid depictions of Paramount's famous and iconic franchises and characters.”

	ByteDance told Deadline that the company “respects intellectual property rights and we have heard the concerns regarding Seedance 2.0.” It continued: “We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorised use of intellectual property and likeness by users.”

	Launched last week, Seedance 2.0 unleashed a slew of authentic-looking deepfakes based on the copyright of Hollywood film and TV studios. A Tom Cruise vs Brad Pitt fight scene went particularly viral, while other popular videos have included alternative endings to series like Stranger Things.


	The Motion Picture Association said: “In a single day, the Chinese AI service Seedance 2.0 has engaged in unauthorized use of U.S. copyrighted works on a massive scale. By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs. ByteDance should immediately cease its infringing activity.”

	











The Human Artistry Campaign, which counts SAG-AFTRA and the Directors Guild of America among its members, said: “The launch of Seedance 2.0 is an attack on every creator around the world. Stealing human creators' work in an attempt to replace them with AI-generated slop is destructive to our culture: stealing isn't innovation.


	“These unauthorized deepfakes and voice clones of actors violate the most basic aspects of personal autonomy and should be deeply concerning to everyone. Authorities should use every legal tool at their disposal to stop this wholesale theft.”

Set in 1870 Wisconsin, Dara Van Dusen's Berlin-bowing first feature is a revisionist Western based on Stewart O'Nan's novella.


							By 

	Leslie Felperin


Contributing Film Critic


	You wait eons for a great tragic film set on the American frontier in the 19th century from a little-known director that features an outstanding male lead performance, a scene-stealing turn from a veteran character actor, and a forest fire — and wouldn't you know it, two come along at once. Well, not quite at once, but just a little over a year apart. Close enough to make you wonder if there's something in the air, a conspiracy afoot, or just great minds thinking alike and taking inspiration from fine literary works.


	Director Clint Bentley's Train Dreams, adapted from Denis Johnson's novel of the same name, premiered at Sundance in 2025, but didn't really build up a critical wind behind it until last fall, as awards season heated up, which is why it feels so recent. This year, A Prayer for the Dying, similar to Train Dreams in all the ways listed above and just as good a film, debuts at Berlin in the newish Perspectives showcase, where it's created a substantial buzz.

The Bottom Line

	
	A blessing in so many ways.
	



Venue: Berlin Film Festival (Perspectives)Cast: Johnny Flynn, John C. Reilly, Kristine Kujath Thorp, Gustav Lindh, Andrew Whipp, Hilton Pelser, Christopher John-Slater, Daniel Weyman, David Ganly, Tadhg Murphy, Christopher RyghDirector/screenwriter: Dara Van Dusen, based on the novel by Stewart O'Nan

								1 hour 35 minutes			






Prayer will definitely make a name for, or at least cement the reputations of, many of the talents attached to it. That goes especially for writer-director Dara Van Dusen, a New Yorker who trained at the Polish National Film School in Lodz and now lives in Norway. Following some well-received shorts, she makes her fearsomely confident debut with this mostly faithful adaptation of Stewart O'Nan's elegant novella.

	A more known quantity on the other hand, Johnny Flynn (Emma, Operation Mincemeat) knocks it out of the park playing Norwegian immigrant and Civil War veteran Jacob Hansen, who also serves as the Wisconsin town of Friendship's local constable, undertaker and preacher. Present in nearly every frame, Flynn's Jacob is a Victorian Job on a bicycle, constantly in motion as he tries to deal with not just an outbreak of diphtheria that threatens the lives of his loved ones, neighbors and everyone in town, but also wildfire getting nearer to Friendship by the minute.


	But kudos are due also to John C. Reilly, serious as a grave after a long run of comic turns (you could say he fills a slot similar to that occupied by William H. Macy in Train Dreams, although Reilly's role is more substantial); up-and-coming Norwegian actor Kristine Kujath Thorp, who plays Jacob's fragile wife Marta; and an international cast of supporting players, who bring surprising, layered depths to the smallest roles. 


	And we haven't even gotten started on the craft contributions, all top-notch, but with special praise due to DP Kate McCullough's stylized, sun-bleached and blood-colored lensing that darts, dashes and dares to zoom; the dead-on period sets by Hubert Pouille; and the patchworked, lovingly dirtied and thoroughly distressed costumes by Ján Kocman. The international cohort shot the film on location in Slovakia, passing plausibly for 1870 Wisconsin.


	Where Train Dreams was, for some, a little too under the ponderous spell of Terrence Malick, with all those wind-ruffled landscapes and figures backlit by magic-hour sunsets, A Prayer for the Dying appears to draw inspiration from grubbier, more gothic visions of the American West. Although set during a summertime drought, the scuffed and slovenly sets and clothing recall Robert Altman's iconic, mud-soaked revisionist western McCabe and Mrs. Miller or, if you prefer something more recent, Deadwood.

	











	Meanwhile, Van Dusen is upfront about how the sui generis compendium of photograph and news stories Wisconsin Death Trip, compiled by Michael Lesy and later made into a film by James Marsh, is also a touchstone here, with its portrait of Midwestern despair and madness in the wake of economic hardship and high mortality rates from diphtheria and other maladies of the time. There are echoes of Death Trip's monochrome 1880s photographs of dead children, miserable hausfraus and other unsmiling locals in the frontal way Van Dusen and McCullough position and frame the characters here, often posed carefully in the horsehair-stuffed furniture these people have saved and scrimped to buy. Their possessions are meager and modest but thoughtfully arranged, the floors meticulously swept, which makes it all the more shocking when vomit starts puddling up everywhere.


	The land looks wide open and empty, but for Jacob, as everything starts to fall apart, there's nowhere to go. Plus, he is a man carrying a heavy freight of trauma from the war, which only ended a few years ago. It's hinted that some of what we see might be figments of his imagination, like the red-toned dream sequences where sifts of hot ash, presaging the fire that's coming, fall over dollhouse versions of the town. There is a dead dog in the road in the first few scenes, echoing a slaughtered horse on a battlefield we see in one early flashback to Jacob's war years. The dog's guts are strewn across the road on a subsequent day, and then — even more eerie and disturbing — the dog seems to have disappeared entirely, although Jacob circles around the spot where it used to be on his bicycle as if he can still see it. Later, someone shoots a perfectly harmless-looking tuxedo cat, lest it might be a disease vector. Animal lovers will find this a challenging watch.

	











	But the suffering of companion animals pales beside the torment meted out to the humans here, as many succumb to the quick-spreading bacterial infection. The camera pans slowly around or inches closer to tableaux of horror as if on railroad tracks, suddenly revealing a hanged figure or a dioramic arrangement of dead women, all dressed in the same ivory-colored gowns, the corpses and their still-living mourners stacked like firewood. 


	Through it all, Jacob struggles not just to endure and protect those he can, but also to keep the faith with his God. Often he kneels to pray, and this marks one of those very rare period films made these days that acknowledges, even celebrates, how profoundly central religion was to nearly everyone only a few generations ago. But true to its Old Testament inspiration and underlying theology, there's no knowing why God has sent these torments to Jacob and his town. He works in mysterious ways, and A Prayer for the Dying stitches that mystery into every frame.

"I didn't even know I was going to be in my relationship, to be honest," the Houston rapper revealed.

Megan Thee Stallion is entering what she calls her “Lover Girl” era — and she says she didn't plan it.


	In a new exclusive interview with PEOPLE, the three-time Grammy winner reflected on her relationship with Dallas Mavericks star Klay Thompson and how focusing on her own healing helped open the door to love.


	“Well, I don't never want to tell [anybody] to just jump in a relationship just because everybody else got one, and I'm not going to tell you to just jump in a relationship because you have to,” the rapper said. “I didn't even know I was going to be in my relationship, to be honest.”

	Megan and Thompson made their red carpet debut in July 2025. But she says the relationship came at a time when she was prioritizing therapy and self-growth.


	“I think that because finally I started being in a better mind space about myself and my life, and I had already been doing a lot of work to heal me,” she said. “I had been going to therapy, I had a bunch of activities that I started doing for myself; maybe God just opened up that space for me to have somebody that loved me right.”


	Now, she says, she feels a level of ease she hasn't experienced before.


	“This is one of the first times that I've ever been just overly comfortable,” Megan said with a laugh: “I'm comfy, babe!”


	Still, she cautions fans against chasing love.

	











	“People got to stop trying to be in love and trying to chase love,” she said. “They just got to let it come to them. When it's meant for you, it's going to happen. God does not give you nothing that is not meant for you.”


	The pair first sent fans into a frenzy in July 2025, when Megan posted a vacation IG photo featuring Klay Thompson in the background. 


	The Dallas Mavericks star also leaned into the rumors and soft-launched his relationship with the Houston rapper at the time, posting a photo dump of a trip to the Bahamas.

A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms, just like the novellas on which it is based, derives its narrative strength by being told entirely from the perspective of Ser Duncan The Tall (Peter Claffey). Gone are the location jumps and gnarled ensembles that pack full hours of Game Of Thrones and House Of The Dragon. This series appreciates the virtues of smallness, that intimacy can reveal a world far more nimbly than scale. One half hour from the eyes of Ser Dunk is all there is and all there needs to be.

This creative direction has its obstacles: On the page, we read Dunk's thoughts, know his memories as they spring to mind, and infer from those he represses the parts of his life he'd rather not dwell on. On the screen, the showrunner and this episode's co-writer, Ira Parker, must externalize these thoughts and memories in live action, just in case some viewers may have missed all the finer nuances that add up to the great wonder that is Ser Dunk The Lunk.

“In The Name Of The Mother,” the penultimate episode in Parker's agreeably earthy and entertaining debut season, begins and ends with the fateful Trial Of Seven, in which Ser Dunk faces his accuser, Prince Aerion “Brightflame” Targaryen (Finn Bennett), who just one night before tormented an innocent puppeteer and paid for it with a few fists and feet to his royal personage. Aerion rallies his father, Prince Maekar (Sam Spruell), the three Kingsguard who attended his family at the Ashford Meadow tourney, his drunkard brother Daeron (Henry Ashton), and the treacherous Ser Steffon Fossoway (Edward Ashley) to fight against Dunk—who, as we saw last week, had a much tougher time rallying heroes to his cause than the realm's royal house. 

Yet true company arrives, thanks to his squire, Aegon “Egg” Targaryen (Dexter Soll Ansell). He brings Sers Baratheon (Daniel Ings), Beesbury (Danny Collins), Hardyng (Ross Anderson), and Rhysling (William Houston) to fight under Dunk's star-lit standard, joining brave Raymun Fossoway (Shaun Thomas), who offered his sword in service to Dunk and was anointed in the mud. Rounding out Dunk's six champions—to the tourney audience's confusion and/or awe—is Prince Baelor “Breakspear” Targaryen (Bertie Carvel), who declares for Dunk in an act of chivalry so enormous that it could only end in doom. Remember: In Westeros, virtue has a half-life of hours.

It's a thematic point that perhaps explains why this week's episode, so named for a knight's vow to protect the innocent (and a rallying cry for Ser Arlan Of Pennytree, as it happens), takes the added measure of flashing back to a fateful day in Dunk's past just before judgment comes crashing into his present. It's a risky creative choice to pause ser's trial at its most dramatic moment just to show us how Dunk learned how to fight dirty in, as George R.R. Martin's prose puts it, “the shadowy wynds and crooked alleys” of King's Landing, where Dunk grew up. With thorough detail, we're shown what compels Dunk to gather strength enough to beat Prince Aerion, twenty minutes of screentime to express this one line from the novella: “[Aerion] could vanquish Ser Duncan The Tall, but not Dunk Of Flea Bottom.” 

And so, with a swing of Aerion's morningstar, Dunk is sent into a brief, muddy sleep, remembering his last days as a thief in King's Landing. We see him, roughly thirteen years ago, scavenging steel and leather from the fallen knights and renegades upon the Redgrass Field, where the last battle of the first Blackfyre Rebellion was decided. (You'll recall some of its finer details were discussed in song by Egg during “The Squire.”) It was there that Princes Baelor and Maekar formed the hammer and anvil that smashed Daemon I Blackfyre's forces and secured King Daeron's rule for a while longer—now a graveyard and primary source of income for Dunk (Bamber Todd) and Rafe (Chloe Lea). “We'll all be plundering that tomb for a dragon's age,” a fence grumbles to the kids when they bring him their findings. 

They're not just scraping for food; Rafe wants to ferry Dunk across the Narrow Sea for a fresh start in the Free Cities. Their chances of making this lateral move dim in the narrow causeways of Flea Bottom, where drunks and thieves like City Watchman Alester (Edward Davis) bully lowborn like Dunk and Rafe for sport. It's impressive how foul and claustrophobic this part of Flea Bottom looks: Men scream as surgery is done on them in the open; women weep in corners; people stagger into each other, leaving themselves vulnerable to pickpocketing or, as Rafe later learns to Dunk's woe, a strategically thrust dagger. Even the one place Dunk and Rafe find relative peace is below the streets, lower in the world still. 

“What if this is the best there is?” wee Dunk asks his companion, who responds: “That would be quite sad.” Even at this late hour, it's a neat bit of groundwork for Dunk's world philosophy, why protecting people with his size and strength matters to him, and why Ser Arlan (Danny Webb), for all his failings, appealed to him so. “You want a family?” Rafe says. “Go out there and get a family.” We know he does, and now we have the additional knowledge that his found families—made with Ser Arlan and, one day, with Egg—are built on her memory.

Was this time out worthwhile? It depends on your point of view. For those who want literal world-building where this series otherwise takes a subtler approach, “In The Name Of The Mother” provides us the first glimpse at the Blackfyre Rebellion—or at least its aftermath. Considering how little of this Westerosi history was mapped out when Martin wrote The Hedge Knight, filling these gaps brings welcome heft and history. This episode should serve future seasons exploring the many complex Targaryen rifts and the lingering revolts spawned from them. It also reiterates a pervasive theme in this franchise, courtesy of Rafe's quick tale of fellow roughs Pudding and Cedric: Payment for past wrongs always comes with compound interest—if not now, then when one least expects it. “No one forgets shit,” she says. “You hurt someone, they hurt you back.” 

For folks here to see some rock-'em-sock-'em knighttime action, still amped up from Prince Baelor's declaration for all that is just and good last week, this pause will chafe. Everything we learn from this flashback is already present in the series: Dunk seeks family where he can; he was taught to soften his edges for those he cares about; he can be provoked to violence by unchecked cruelty. We've seen all this, know all this. This late into the series, it feels like padding. Still, it's well-directed, well-written padding, rife with narrative echoing: Ser Alran blorfs before protecting Dunk, just as Dunk blorfs before standing up to Prince Aerion; and wee Dunk hoists Ser Arlan's penny-hilted sword just as Egg takes it for practice years later. These added textures of Dunk's origin are appreciated, but at this defining moment? They scrape the nerves of folks spoiling to see the outcome of Dunks' Trial Of Seven. 

Which brings us back to the present, where Dunk rallies with the few commanding words from Ser Arlan we've yet to hear: “Get up.” Up is where Dunk goes, though not without effort (that lance through his side meekened him even before he was unhorsed). The scope of this fight, fittingly, leans on subjectivity instead of choreography. Here, Dunk's point of view is severely diminished by that narrow slit in his helm, and later, one of his eyes is closed shut, so we miss the peripheral thrills one might expect from this fracas (such as Ser Lyonel laughing his way through Maekar's defenses, the Fossoway cousins letting off long-fermenting steam between them, etc). We do see the only moment that counts: Prince Aerion dropping his dragon's facade under Dunk's relentless pummelling, yielding his accusations before all in Ashford Meadow. (Had he not thrown in the towel, would Dunk have risked killing a prince?) 

What we don't see is Maekar's blow to his older brother's head, which crushes Baelor's helm and removes another good man from the realm—one whose life might have changed much for Westeros had it not ended here. The man called “Breakspear” for trouncing the traitor Daemon Blackfyre's armies on the Redgrass Field, who ruled in the name of Daeron “The Good” and would have made a fair and just king himself, dies in service to a hedge knight who reminded him what justice looks like when those who swore to uphold it remember their vows. What might the realm have looked like under the rule of Baelor, second in line to the Iron Throne? We'll never know. In Westeros, much as it is in life, few good deeds go unpunished.

If you tuned into the IMDb YouTube page to catch the 2026 Film Independent Spirit Awards, the vibe felt different this year.

Blame the 2028 Summer Olympics. Although we are in deep on watching Curling, Figure Skating, and Skeleton races in Milan, Italy, the city of Los Angeles is already preparing to host the summer games — and that impeded on Film Independent's ability to host its show on the beaches of Santa Monica.

Instead, the awards ceremony was hosted steps away from the Walk of Fame, at the Hollywood Palladium — a concert venue that recently hosted Demi Lovato and Chance the Rapper.

 










The shift also represented a more subdued awards show. A “Saturday Night Live” alumni hosted — as it did with Aidy Bryant — this year the event hired Ego Nwodim fresh off her NBC exit. She played off her standup persona, Miss Eggy. It garnered her a lot of laughs in her final season; here, the character did not play as well.

Kudos to the ceremony for finishing exactly on time, but no-shows were one reason Film Independent pulled it off. Emmy winners Stephen Graham and Owen Cooper also won at the Spirits; they were absent, despite the Netflix limited series being the big winner among the TV categories. Also Best Supporting Performance winner Naomi Ackie (“Sorry, Baby”) had also missed out.

 










Every once in a while, the Film Independent Spirit Awards has been an Oscar precursor. Last year “Anora” won Best Feature Film, Best Director, and Best Lead Performance. Two years prior, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” took the same trifecta. Both films would go on to win similar categories at the Oscars.

This year's winner of Best Feature Film and Best Director, Clint Bentley's “Train Dreams,” can't follow suit at the Oscars (the Netflix film was nominated for Best Picture, but not Best Director). The Gotham Awards, which long had similar nominees to the Film Independent Spirit Awards until it got rid of its budget cap, was more on the nose in giving its Best Film award to “One Battle After Another.”

The Oscar voting trend that the 2026 Film Independent Spirit Awards did hit is the embrace of Brazilian filmmakers. Not only did Best International Feature frontrunner “The Secret Agent” win the Indie Spirit award for Best International Feature Film, but Adolpho Veloso, the first Brazilian nominee for the Best Cinematography Oscar, also won the Indie Spirit award for Best Cinematography for his work on “Train Dreams.”

Worth noting too that “Song Sung Blue” star Kate Hudson handed her fellow Best Actress nominee Rose Byrne the Independent Spirit Award for Best Lead Performance. That may have served as the best indication that the event could still maintain the vibes that let them bring together film and TV contenders behind all backgrounds and budgets.

[Editor's note: The following interview contains spoilers for “Industry” Season 4, Episode 6, “Dear Henry.”]

After Season 3 of “Industry,” actor Ken Leung, who plays Eric Tao, had a message for series creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay.

“Ken said, ‘I'd love to do a fourth season, but you need to tell me what's materially different about it,'” Kay said when he was a guest with Down on an upcoming episode of IndieWire's Toolkit podcast.

Asked about this conversation, Leung told IndieWire, “I had felt like a circle had been closed, and I said, ‘Well, if we're going to continue, then we need to open a new circle.'”

Leung also shared with the creators a Samuel Johnson quote: “He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man,” which they all agreed had encapsulated Eric, a character who had failed in all aspects of his life that required humanity.

“We wanted to make good on that quote, which is ‘What is he at his most beastly, indulging in that really vicious side of his id?'” Kay said.

 










The starting point, though, would be with a more reflective Eric, as he's drawn out of retirement and back to London to work with Harper (Myha'la). Bored with golfing and grilling, the underlying motivation for returning to London is to make amends with the people in his life, and to make an attempt at being a better mentor, father, and human being.

“It's the clearest example of a character wanting to be a better person,” Down said. “And because it's ‘Industry,' that character has to have the greatest fall.”

That fall hit with T-H-U-D in “Dear Henry,” the sixth episode of Season 4, when Eric learns that the person he's been sleeping with — Dolly (Skye Degruttola), a prostitute hired by Whitney (Max Mingella) as part of a blackmail scheme — is 14 years old. It's a revelation that triggers Eric's last three unforgettable scenes of the season as he a) goes on CNN to fall on his sword and protect Tao-Stern, b) painfully dissolves his partnership with Harper, and c) walks off the stage to Judy Collins' “Both Sides Now” in the episode's end credits.

IndieWire spoke to Down, Kay, and Leung about those three scenes, the last shot, how it should be interpreted, and if Eric's “Industry” storyline just came to its end.

Considering the long list of Eric's despicable acts — remember when he weaponized Adler's (Trevor White) brain tumor against him at the end of Season 3? — Down, and Kay had a challenge: What would be so beastly it could actually level Eric? For the audience, learning that he was sleeping with a minor would likely qualify, but Leung felt there was something missing in how he would play it.

 










“On the page, she looks like just another fling, just another girl,” Leung said. “And I didn't want to approach it that way.”

Leung concocted an internal way of thinking about his relationship with Dolly that incorporated his character's attempt to “unearth some of the humanity” he had lost climbing the corporate ladder, making being confronted with the truth a more powerful gut punch.

“I thought, ‘What if Dolly, in Eric's mind — the mess, the jungle that that is — what if she's the one? What if in his mission to find a new path to his daughter, to have a new relationship with Harper, he sees Dolly in a whole new way?'” Leung said. “What before might've been just a fling, another girl, another conquest, he's like, ‘This is my chance at something lasting.' So that then when the betrayal happens, the descending to his knees, comes because of that miscalculation. That's how I treated it.”

In the “Industry” writers' room, it was referred to as Eric's “8 Mile” scene — a reference to Eminem's B-Rabbit winning the climactic rap battle by disarming his opponent with the verse, “I know everything he's about to say against me. I am white, I am a fucking bum, I do live in a trailer with my mom.”

 










To both defeat Whitney and insulate Tao-Stern, Eric essentially does the same thing by publicly owning Whitney's disparaging remarks and bringing the focus back to Tender, and why they should submit to an independent audit.

“That is one scene where, in order to win this final battle, he has to marshal the Eric that we know [from previous seasons],” Leung said. “That was fun to revisit, a fun touch point of the Eric that we know, in a season of a different, more reflective Eric.”

Post-CNN battle, all that's left of Eric is the hollowed shell of what he's become as a result of the Dolly revelation. Having wanted to play doting mentor, it's painful to watch Eric barely able to speak to, let alone look at, an emotional and confused Harper as he exits their partnership.

“It's a difficult thing because we love Ken, we love writing Eric, we love that character, and it's quite tricky sometimes to take a character that you love writing and you actually have such fondness for, and bring him to his knees in the worst possible way, giving him something that there is no way to go back from,” Down said. “It's making a statement about not being able to run away from your demons, not being able to run away from the things that cripple you.”

 










For Leung's part, there was nothing to discuss about the scene with the creators, nor to figure out with his scene partner, Myha'la, beforehand. “I don't even know what there would be to discuss,” Leung said. “It was all on the page.”

What was also on the page but landed on the cutting room floor was an additional scene between Eric, his daughter Lily (Serrana Su-Ling Bliss), and his ex-wife Candice (Alexandra Moen) that immediately preceded the end credits and Eric's walk down the street.

Leung described the scene, “[Lily] shows up with a nose ring, which echoes back to Harper's nose ring in Season 1. Eric makes a comment about it, it's triggering to him, and he blows up at his daughter for wearing a nose ring, and instantly regrets it.  He has to kind of extricate himself from the situation, and says, ‘I'm gonna go get a pack of cigarettes.' And who knows if that's where he's really going, but he just needs to remove himself, and then that walk follows that.”

That deleted scene would have shed a different light on Eric's final walk-off, which is more open to interpretation without the additional context. Extracting the nose ring scene was also not an isolated instance.

“We shot a number of scenes with Serrana Bliss,  who played my daughter, that didn't make it,” Leung said. “It's interesting to note because I think it informed a lot, there's almost a shadow season underneath the season that we see.”

 










This sheds light on the difference in how Leung and the two creators discuss the character's motivations. Whereas Down and Kay see Eric in Season 4 as wanting to be a better person to all those in his life (placing an emphasis on making amends with Harper), Leung sees his character's efforts being far more father-centric, with the deleted Lily scenes playing a significant role in how he approached the character. 

According to Leung, in his eyes, even Eric's return to London was principally motivated by Lily (not a partnership with Harper, which in his mind was a means to the end), pointing to a phone call cut from Episode 1, in which he learns Lily has been getting in trouble and “starting to show signs that resemble Eric's worst qualities.”

Judy Collins' “Both Sides Now” was intended to be a musical motif throughout Episode 6 — Kay originally thought it could play during Henry (Kit Harrington) and Whitney's glory hole excursion [an idea nixed by the song's right's holder] — but they also knew it would be the perfect song to set the emotional tone for Eric's end credit walk.

“It's about loss, regret, it's just so sad, but kind of so uplifting as well,” Kay said of the Collins' classic. “And at that last moment, when Eric walks away, it's like: Is he walking into a better future? Is he walking into hell?”

 










“The answer is ‘Yes' and ‘Yes,'” Leung said when IndieWire read him Kay's two open-ended questions and called attention to director Luke Snellin's final shot.

“The way it lives in what we see, I think it's where me playing Eric ends, and where the actor plus you, the viewer, are together in what that means,” Leung said. “I don't think it's my province to say.  It's so dreamy, and formless, we don't see his face. It's not really about him. It's not about how he's feeling. It's not about even where he is going. It's about the walking away. You're just as in that scene as I am.”

Kay said Arthur Miller's definition of a “tragic figure” was something he and Down kept in mind as they concluded Eric's Season 4 arc. 

“‘Self knowledge arrives, but it's too late,' and I think that's Eric,” Kay said. “The choices you've made have led you to a point where things can start to come into focus, regret can start to really weigh in, and you can start to know simple, true things about yourself and feel ready to access those things, but you're past a point in your life where it's actually going to make any difference.  That's the essence of a tragic figure, there's no way back.”

But will Eric find his way back to “Industry” for a yet-to-be-announced (but seemingly inevitable) Season 5? While on the podcast, Kay and Down cautioned against making a connection between Eric's Episode 6 exit and Gus (David Johnson) and Robert (Harry Lawtey) not returning to the series.

 










“When characters have found some kind of redemption, they've extricated themselves from the world of ‘Industry' and the operating system which it propagates. They don't belong in the universe anymore,” Down said of why Gus and Robert haven't returned.

The creators rightfully noted that Eric having gained a similar level of self-knowledge, but that it coming as a result of sleeping with a 14-year-old, was not the same type of redemptive story beat resulting in a character graduating from the immoral and cut-throat world of “Industry.” Kay and Down were noncommittal about Leung's return, and said they only had just started to allow themselves to think about how they might want to end the series. (The podcast was recorded in early January.)

Asked if he was engaged in similar between-season conversations with Down and Kay about his character, Leung cryptically answered, “I'm going to say ‘no' to discussions.” Pushed on a clarification about what he meant by that, the actor added, “Come on, Chris. You know I can't say what I want to say.” 

Demonstrating one of the many differences between Leung and his character.

The search for Nancy Guthrie is entering its third week, with new information continuing to come out. And with that, there was a new report released by the Arizona Family on Sunday, Feb. 15, in which a source says that investigators are looking into whether her disappearance was a burglary that went wrong. 

However, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has responded to this, clearing things up.

“Did not come from us. No idea, and even though that is one of many possibilities, we would never speculate such a thing. We will let the evidence take us to motive,” Nanos told Fox News' Matt Finn. 

The FBI also provided a comment to Finn, saying that they have “no clue where that came from.”

Fox News' Michael Ruiz added that a local law enforcement official said, “this is not the working theory inside the unit.”

In a video posted on February 15, the beloved “Today” anchor spoke out, pleading for her mother's safe return. 

“I wanted to come on and, um, it's been two weeks since our mom was taken, and I just wanted to come on and say that, um, we still have hope, and we still believe,” Savannah said.

“And I wanted to say to whoever has her or knows where she is that it's never too late and you're not lost or alone and it is never too late to do the right thing,” she added. “And we are here, and we believe, and we believe in the essential goodness of every human being, and it's never too late.”

Many left comments under the video, showing their support. 

“We believe and we are with you, your family and most of all, Nancy,” Al Roker posted. 

“You and your family are being held up with love supported with love guided with hope,” Maria Shriver said. 

“We are with you in this valley @savannahguthrie 🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️❤️,” ABC News' Deborah Roberts commented. 

An FBI spokesperson told Fox News that “a glove with a DNA profile recovered in the Nancy Guthrie case is different from other gloves that have been found and appears to match the gloves of the subject seen in the surveillance video.”

According to the outlet, authorities found approximately 16 gloves during their search. Still, the spokesperson said, “most of them were searchers' gloves that they discarded in various areas when they searched the vicinity.”

“The one with the DNA profile recovered is different and appears to match the gloves of the subject in the surveillance video,” the spokesperson added.

Today, Savannah Guthrie is in front of a camera for a reason no daughter ever wants to be. Not from the bright lights of the “Today” studio, but from her home, speaking through heartbreak as she pleads for her mother's safe return.

Two weeks after her mother, Nancy Guthrie, was abducted from her Tucson home, Savannah Guthrie returned to social media with a heartfelt message.

In a video posted February 15, the “Today” co-anchor spoke directly to the person who may have information about her mother's whereabouts. Her voice was steady but emotional as she addressed viewers and the individual she believes may be holding Nancy.

“I wanted to come on and, um, it's been two weeks since our mom was taken, and I just wanted to come on and say that, um, we still have hope, and we still believe,” Savannah said.

Savannah used the moment to send a message beyond her immediate audience. She appealed directly to whoever may know where Nancy is.

“And I wanted to say to whoever has her or knows where she is that it's never too late and you're not lost or alone and it is never too late to do the right thing,” she said.

Her words focused on compassion rather than anger. Savannah spoke about belief in humanity, even in the middle of uncertainty.

“And we are here, and we believe, and we believe in the essential goodness of every human being, and it's never too late.”

The brief video quickly spread online, with supporters flooding the comments with prayers and messages of encouragement.

As Savannah continues to speak publicly about her mother's disappearance, support has flooded in from colleagues and friends across television and beyond.

Al Roker wrote, “We believe, and we are with you, your family, and most of all, Nancy.”

Maria Shriver added, “You and your family are being held up with love supported with love guided with hope.”

Deborah Roberts echoed that sentiment, posting, “We are with you in this valley @savannahguthrie 🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️❤️.”

Another supporter wrote, “The world is praying for you and your family! God is holding your mom tightly until she returns back home to you!!!”

For the Guthrie family, the public encouragement has become a steady source of comfort during an unimaginable time.

Nancy Guthrie, the mother of “Today” co-anchor Savannah Guthrie, was last seen the evening of January 31 after being dropped off at her Tucson home following time with family.

She was reported missing around noon on February 1 after failing to log on to a scheduled virtual church service with a friend. 

After more than two weeks into the investigation, authorities continue pursuing new leads as her family waits anxiously for answers and for her safe return.

According to a new report in Arizona Family, a source familiar with the case says investigators are increasingly examining whether Nancy's disappearance may have begun as a burglary that escalated. 

Nearly 16 gloves were recovered about two miles from her home, most discarded by search teams. However, one glove “appears to match” the pair worn by a masked man seen in surveillance footage outside her residence, the FBI said. 

The glove has been sent to a private laboratory in Florida for DNA testing.

Federal officials describe the suspect as approximately 5 feet 9 inches to 5 feet 10 inches tall with an average build. In the footage, he is seen wearing a black ski mask, dark clothing, and black gloves, and carrying a black 25-liter Ozark Trail Hiker Pack backpack. 

Several individuals have been questioned and later released. No arrests have been made as forensic testing continues.

This is a developing story.

Brooklyn Beckham is doubling down on his love for Nicola Peltz as his family feud rages on.

Beckham shared a loving message for his wife on Instagram in honor of Valentine's Day, accompanying it with a black-and-white photo of them sharing a steamy kiss.

The Cloud23 founder, 26, appears shirtless in the pic while Peltz, 31, wears a white crop top showing off her toned midriff.

“Happy Valentine's Day baby x I am the luckiest person in the world to be able to call you my valentines every year x I love you more than you know and I will forever protect and love you x,” Beckham wrote.

Beckham has firmly stood by Peltz's side after he publicly declared last month that he didn't want to reconcile with his parents, David and Victoria Beckham, in a scathing statement blasting them.

Brooklyn accused his parents of trying to ruin his marriage, and also alleged that mom Victoria hijacked his first dance at his 2022 wedding that was supposed to be with Peltz and danced “inappropriately” with him.

Since then, Brooklyn and Peltz have publicly declared their love for one another while sharing romantic snaps of their getaways. They've also been snapped together on date nights, looking happier than ever and sharing plenty of PDA.

While Brooklyn has covered up his tattoos that were once dedicated to his father and siblings, his family still appears o have love for him.

On Valentine's Day, his sister, 14-year-old Harper, posted an old photo of herself with all three of her brothers — Brooklyn, Romeo, and Cruz — on her private Instagram account.

The black-and-white snap showed Harper beaming with her arms around Brooklyn, as Romeo, 23, and Cruz, 20, stood behind with their arms around each other while they were all in a swimming pool.

“I love you all so much words can't describe it,” Harper wrote, tagging her three older brothers.

Romeo reposted the photo to his Instagram Stories, adding an infinity emoji over it.

Victoria also shared another photo that Harper had posted of herself with her three siblings on her Instagram Stories.

“Happy Valentine's Day to the best big brothers in the whole wide world x,” Harper captioned the photo.

Late last month, People reported that the Beckhams were open to reconciling with Brooklyn, but not Peltz.

“The Beckhams have no intention of reconciling with their son unless Nicola is out of the picture,” a source told the outlet, adding, “That's not an ultimatum he's going to cave on.”

The insider continued to claim that Brooklyn “has felt more support from his wife in these past three years than from his parents in his entire life.”

The 41st annual Independent Spirit Awards looked a little different than years past, with the Hollywood Palladium replacing the customary beachfront backdrop. But the truly important things — the celebration of independent filmmaking and the communal gathering of artists who sometimes only see each other once a year — remained the same. 

Much like great coffee, great movies and the craft of making them can bring people together. On the show's iconic blue carpet, IndieWire and Lavazza partnered to celebrate the artists who made some of our favorite films and TV shows. Through conversations co-hosted by IndieWire's Christian Zilko and filmmaker and content creator Reagan Yorke, the filmmakers and stars spoke about what the spirit of independence means to them — and why it's vital to any truly great project, regardless of budget or medium.

The big winner of the show was Clint Bentley's “Train Dreams,” which took home the Spirit awards for Best Feature and Best Director. On the carpet before the big wins, star Joel Edgerton spoke about the way the film‘s location shoot in Washington allowed him to connect with the Pacific Northwestern scenery that shaped his character's life so deeply.

“I found it extraordinary, being in the landscape,” Edgerton said. “And it was imperative that we were out there. You can't build that stuff on a set. It's remarkable how it reminds you that being in nature creates a certain quiet. A surprise for me was how much it tunes your senses and makes you pick up on the most tiny sounds. It was a very special environment to be in. I don't know that the crew would say the same, because they had to lug all the equipment, but as an actor it was very special.”

As it turns out, the crew did say the same. When we caught up with “Train Dreams” cinematographer Adolpho Veloso, who won Best Cinematography, he raved about the experience of shooting on location and explained that relying on natural light allowed him greater flexibility with less equipment on set. 

It was a historic day for “Esta Isla,” which was the first Puerto Rican film to be nominated for an Independent Spirit Award. Co-writers and directors Cristian Carretero and Lorraine Jones Molina celebrated the milestone on the carpet, explaining what it means to bring a distinctly Puerto Rican film to a larger audience.

“It feels great to speak up for Puerto Rico, which is where we're from, and have people from around the world connect with our story and our island,” Molina said. “Independent Spirit Awards is such a good name, because it feeds our spirit, our soul.”

 










TV was not left out of the fun either, as “The Pitt” star Supriya Ganesh stopped by to talk about her first impressions of the script for the HBO Max juggernaut. She praised the show for taking the kinds of creative risks that would normally be found in independent films and applying them on an even bigger scale. 

“I think we're trying to do something new and different. That's what really drew me to the script when I first read it. I have a background in medicine too, so I could tell it was an incredibly accurate script. It was the first thing I've ever read for a doctor character where I really could see the logical flow of what they were doing. And that's just so daring, and that's in the vein of what independent cinema does. We really didn't know if this would work, and it really has.”

Our interviews on the carpet made it clear that, win or lose, everyone was better off for having the experience of coming together to celebrate a year of cinematic craftsmanship. For more of our conversations, continue to monitor the IndieWire and Lavazza USA Instagram accounts.

If you've been side-eyeing the future of Hallmark fan-favorites, Hannah and Norman, relax; your comfort-watch couple is safe. Yep, you read that right. In a recent Instagram post Alison Sweeney delivered exactly the kind of reassurance fans love to hear, and it seems like she did it in the most casual way possible while promoting her upcoming Hallmark movie.

On February 10, 2026, Sweeney shared a behind-the-scenes look at her new project, but some longtime viewers quickly noticed the real headline: Hannah Swensen and Norman Rhodes are not going anywhere.

In the post (seen above), Sweeney addressed the elephant in the cozy mystery room. Speaking about her beloved character from the “Hannah Swensen Mysteries,” she made it crystal clear that fans don't need to panic about the future of the franchise's central romance.

“We love Hannah & Norman – and don't worry , they're not going anywhere,” the caption reads.

Honestly? That's the kind of energy fans have been hoping for.

For viewers who've followed Hannah's slow-burn relationship with Norman Rhodes (played by Gabriel Hogan) the reassurance matters. The duo has built a loyal fanbase over the years, and any hint of change tends to set off speculation. Sweeney's message feels intentionally calming, like she knows exactly what the fandom needed to hear.

And let's be real; when a cozy mystery couple works this well, nobody wants unnecessary shakeups.

While the familiar duo remains safe, Sweeney is clearly excited about exploring something fresh. Her new Hallmark project, “Romance at Hope Ranch,” premieres February 28, 2026 at 8:00pm ET on Hallmark Channel (streaming next day on Hallmark+), and it gives her and Hogan a chance to stretch into new territory.

“Working with Gabe on these new, different characters was so much fun – the characters Hope & Jack have a totally new energy for us…” she shared. “I think you'll have fun getting to know this new world too.”

It seems like the goal here isn't replacement; it's expansion. Fans get to keep their favorite mystery couple and watch the same actors play in a completely different romantic sandbox. That's kind of a win-win.

The “totally new energy” comment is especially telling. Sweeney and Hogan clearly know their Hannah/Norman dynamic inside and out, so stepping into Hope and Jack's shoes gives them room to shake things up while keeping longtime viewers comfortably fed.

The post also included a personal highlight that adds an extra layer of heart to the project. Sweeney revealed that her daughter Megan appears in the film… and you can tell the moment meant a lot to her.

“Getting to work with my daughter on set was so special for me. She did such a great job and everyone loved having her bright positive ‘vibes' on set.” Cue the collective aww.

It's the kind of behind-the-scenes detail Hallmark fans eat up; wholesome, genuine, and full of good energy. And honestly, it fits perfectly with the tone Sweeney has built across her projects

It seems like Alison Sweeney managed to do two things at once: reassure loyal mystery fans and build excitement for something new. Hannah and Norman of “Hannah Swensen Mysteries” are still very much in play, but Hope and Jack of “Romance at Hope Ranch” are ready to have their moment too.

And if early vibes are any indication? Fans are probably going to show up for both.

Updated: The 2026 Film Independent Spirit Awards has concluded, with “Train Dreams” winning three awards including the day's top honor, Best Feature. Rose Byrne won Best Lead Performance for her Oscar-nominated turn in “If I Had Legs I'd Kick You,” Alex Russell's “Lurker” picked up two awards including Best First Feature, and yes, “Adolescence” won even more awards after an Emmys-and-you-name-it cleanup over the last few months, today with a sweep across all the Netflix series' nominated TV categories.

All the winners are below.

Earlier: The Independent Spirit Awards look a little different this year, with the iconic Santa Monica beach tent temporarily giving way to an indoor show at the Hollywood Palladium due to Los Angeles' ongoing preparations for the 2028 Summer Olympics. But while the setting has changed, the award show's core mission of celebrating the best independent films (and TV shows that embody the spirit of independent filmmaking) remains the same.

This year's class of nominees is headlined by some of the biggest indies of 2025, including Sundance hits “Train Dreams,” “Sorry, Baby,” “If I Had Legs I'd Kick You,” “Twinless,” and “Peter Hujar's Day.” A handful of films, like “Train Dreams” and “The Secret Agent,” a Spirit win could be a step towards a big night at the Oscars. But for most of the field, the Spirits and the validation they provide from the independent film community are now an end in and of themselves. 

The 41st Independent Spirit Awards can be streamed live on the IMDb and Film Independent YouTube channels beginning at 5 p.m. ET/2 p.m. PT on Sunday, February 15. IndieWire is partnering with Lavazza to bring you coverage from the blue carpet, so check out IndieWire and Lavazza's Instagram accounts for all of our conversations with nominees and presenters. This year's show is hosted by Ego Nwodim.

David Harbour was spotted out on a stroll in New York City with a mystery woman on Valentine's Day while many of his “Stranger Things” co-stars were gathered not far away to celebrate Maya Hawke's nuptials.Harbour, 50, dressed in an olive green pea coat, casual pants, and a blue ball cap, walked along with his unnamed friend, a redhead also sporting a ball cap and bundled up in a warm coat. Harbour is currently in divorce proceedings with ex Lily Allen, whom he was married to for four years and split with in 2025.

Meanwhile, Hawke married boyfriend Christian Lee Hutson at St. George's Episcopal Church in front of her parents, Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman, as well as many co-stars from the Netflix series.

Finn Wolfhard, Joe Keery, Caleb McLaughlin, Gaten Matarazzo, Sadie Sink, and Natalie Dyer attended, as well as stars Sam Nivola and Kathryn Newton.

It's been a time of upheaval for Harbour. Last February, news broke that Harbour and Allen, who married in 2020, were separating. That same month, Allen revealed that she had gone to a treatment center for “emotional turmoil.”

Allen was previously married to Sam Cooper, with whom she shares two daughters.

On the song “Madeline,” Allen, 40, sang about Harbour breaking the rules in their “open” marriage. She also implied that her ex is a “sex addict” who cheated on her in her new “West End Girl” album.

Speculation also surfaced that Harbour had an affair with costume designer Natalie Tippett.

Last year, Harbour was also reportedly accused of bullying and harassing Millie Bobby Brown on the set of “Stranger Things.”

The “Enola Holmes” star filed a complaint about Harbour before filming the show's fifth and final season.

The “Hellboy” star reportedly faced an internal investigation. However, the outcome is unknown.

In the global blockbuster, Harbour plays police chief Jim Hopper Jr., who is a father figure to Eleven, played by Brown.

He has previously said how he has felt protective of Brown, who was a child when she first started filming.

“Millie and I have always had sort of a special relationship because I knew her when she was so young. I knew her before any of this big fame hit,” Harbour said on an episode of the “That Scene with Dan Patrick” podcast in 2021.

“I have a real protective feeling for her. I have a real, like, worry,” he continued. “I worry about her and the fame and all that she has to struggle with.”

The former president clarified comments he made about extraterrestrial life on a podcast over the weekend.

Former U.S. President Barack Obama said he did not see evidence that aliens “have made contact with us,” after sending social media abuzz by saying aliens were real on a podcast over the weekend.

During a lightning round of questions with podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen, Obama was asked, “Are aliens real?”

“They're real,” he answered, continuing: “But I haven't seen them. And, they're not being kept in Area 51.”

On Sunday, the former president released a statement on Instagram, appearing to clarify what he meant by his comments that have since gone viral.

“I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it's gotten attention let me clarify. Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we've been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”

Secrecy around Area 51, a top-secret Cold War test site in the Nevada desert, has long fueled conspiracy theories among UFO enthusiasts.

In 2013, the CIA acknowledged the existence of the site, but not of UFO crashes, black-eyed extraterrestrials, or staged moon landings.

Declassified documents referred to the 8,000-square-mile installation by name after decades of U.S. government officials refusing to acknowledge it.

The base has been a testing ground for a host of top-secret aircraft, including the U-2 in the 1950s and later the B-2 stealth bomber.

Newly released deposition footage of Ghislaine Maxwell has ignited a firestorm online, with some social media users claiming the woman in the video “isn't her.” Side-by-side image comparisons and viral posts have fueled wild speculation about whether Maxwell is truly behind bars. While official records confirm her incarceration, the internet isn't convinced. Here's what sparked the frenzy, and what the facts actually show.

Ever since Robert Johnson supposedly sold his soul to the devil at a crossroads in return for musical success, the music world has been filled with legends and conspiracy theories.

Things have gotten worse thanks to the internet, as there's hardly a single modern celebrity that has remained untouched by some outlandish rumour or not been attributed a bizarre urban legend.

Most of them are baseless, with one or two speculations capturing the collective imagination through renewed interest – much like the new forensic report suggesting that Kurt Cobain's death may have been a homicide staged as a suicide.

Here are 12 of the most persistent and strangest conspiracy theories in the music world.

We start with the biggest music conspiracy theory of them all: Paul McCartney died in a car crash in 1966, and the former Beatle was replaced by a lookalike.

The “Paul Is Dead” urban legend took hold with fans recognising “clues” in the band's work. You see, the story goes that the remaining Beatles concealed the death, felt guilty about the lie, and began to leave messages in the music to share the truth with their fans.

The biggest piece of evidence? The cover of the 1969 album 'Abbey Road', in which McCartney is pictured walking barefoot and out of step with the other Beatles – meaning that the real Paul was no more. Fans understood this visual as a funeral procession: John Lennon is the clergyman in white; Ringo Starr is the mourner in black; and George Harrison is grave digger in denim.

Need more? The VW licence plate in the background reads ‘28IF' - as in: Paul would have been 28 years old IF he had lived to 1969.

McCartney has responded on many occasions, trying to dispel the rumour. Our favourite? When he quoted Mark Twain when issuing a statement that read: “Rumours of my death have been greatly exaggerated."

This conspiracy stems from the album cover of David Bowie's 1972 masterpiece ‘The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars', which sees Bowie standing on 23 Heddon Street under a sign that says "K. West."

Never mind that the sign belonged to a furrier store... Some thought “K. West” was code for “Quest” and over the years, fans have dug deeper. You see, the album features the song ‘Five Years' and in 1977, a certain Kanye Omari West was born... Coincidence? Perish the thought!

The theory doesn't end there though, as Bowie's final album was titled ‘Blackstar' - something which many interpreted as the chameleon of rock anointing his successor, ie: Kanye ‘Ye' West.

False pre-autopsy information provided to the press in July 1974 led to the rumour that Cass Elliot (“Mama Cass”) of the Mamas and the Papas died after choking on a ham sandwich.

In reality, the 32-year-old died of a heart attack during her sleep in Harry Nilsson's apartment in London, with no drugs in her system – as many were quick to call out drug use. The cause of death was due to fatty degeneration of the heart, possibly caused by obesity and crash dieting.

Strangely enough, The Who's Keith Moon died in the same flat and bed as Mama Cass four years later, also aged 32. This led many to declare Nilsson's apartment as cursed. That we buy.

Some Elvis fans still don't want to believe that the King of Rock'n'Roll died on the toilet on 16 August 1977, as a multitude of conspiracy theorists – nicknamed “Alivers” - state that Presley faked his death and did not die of a massive heart attack.

The proof? The King's autopsy was kept confidential as he was a US spy who entered the witness protection program, and the whole truth can be found in a suppressed, top-secret, 633-page FBI report that the US government is keeping under lock and key.

What more evidence do you need???

Another album cover that seems to hide some secrets...

Supertramp's 1979 album ‘Breakfast in America' features a waitress as a Statue of Liberty substitute over the New York City skyline, as viewed from a plane. She holds a glass of orange juice instead of a torch, which is positioned in front of the Twin Towers.

Ergo: the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks were predicted by Supertramp!

Need more? If you hold the record in front of a mirror, the “U” and the “P” in “SUPERTRAMP” look like “11” and “9” respectively, hovering over the towers. Chilling.

Several songs over the years have been accused of containing subliminal messages, with fundamentalist Christian groups always keen to condemn popular tracks as satanic through backmasking – a recording technique in which a message is recorded backward onto a track that is meant to be played forward.

The conspiracies reached their peak during the 1980s Satanic Panic in the US, when Christian parents were warned that rock music was a conduit leading innocent listeners straight into the arms of the Prince of Darkness.

The most infamous theory was that Led Zeppelin's classic ‘Stairway to Heaven' was an ode to Old Nick, as it contains the backward message: "It's my sweet Satan... Oh I will sing because I live with Satan.”

Other songs accused of backwardly flirting with The Devil include The Beatles' ‘Revolution 9', John Lennon's ‘Imagine', The Eagles' ‘Hotel California' and Britney Spears' ‘...Baby One More Time'.

Music fans love to speculate over the death of an icon, with many claiming that musicians never died at all or that foul play was involved. Popular ones include: the previously mentioned Elvis theory; Jimi Hendrix didn't overdose and was murdered by his former manager; the CIA was responsible for Bob Marley's death; Jim Morrison didn't really overdose in a bathtub; Michael Jackson faked his death and still alive.

But the most persistent conspiracy theory surrounds Kurt Cobain's death.

The Nirvana frontman's body was found at his Seattle apartment on 5 April 1994 and his cause of death was ruled to be a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the face, as Cobain has been wrestling with drug abuse and depression for years. However, countless Nirvana fans still insist that it wasn't suicide and that Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, had something to do with it.

The persistent conjecture cites the rocker's supposedly tampered suicide note, discrepencies regarding the crime scene, and the fact that Cobain had too much heroin in his system to operate a shotgun.

A 1998 documentary by Nick Broomfield titled Kurt & Courtney ran with these theories, discovering evidence that Cobain was going to divorce Love and uncovering testimonies that Love had allegedly arranged his murder to retain her husband's fortune. Later, a 2014 documentary, Soaked in Bleach, also explored the conspiracy surrounding Cobain's suicide, and theaters showing the film were met with a cease-and-desist notice from Love's law firm – something which only fuelled speculation further.

Three decades since Cobain's tragic death, a new independent investigation has reignited debate over what truly happened, challenging the suicide ruling, and affirming that the suicide could be a staged homicide.

Exploring Kurt Cobain's overlooked social activism – 30 years since his death

Forensic experts' new report claims that Kurt Cobain may have been murdered 

Dave Gahan once allegedly bit a journalist's neck in 1994, and has admitted to sleeping in a coffin-shaped bed. Plus, he looks great for his age. That's enough for some to be convinced that Depeche Mode's frontman is a blood sucking creature destined to roam the planet for centuries – while giving us hits like ‘Enjoy The Silence', ‘Personal Jesus' and ‘Walking In My Shoes.'

If this turns out to be true, we're not complaining. And anyone who's ever seen the band live can attest to the fact the 63-year-old doesn't seem to be affected by the trappings of time. Good for him.

The theory goes that after the release of her debut album ‘Let Go', Avril Lavigne was supposedly replaced by someone called Melissa Vandella, as the angsty Canadian punk-popper couldn't handle the instant fame.

Evidence for the doppelganger switcheroo? Melissa is taller, wears more skirts, and Avril changed musical influences over her career far too many times.

Fans are just probably in denial that the artist who gave them hits like ‘Complicated' and ‘With You' was ever capable of delivering the cultural appropriation trash that is ‘Hello Kitty'.

Lavigne has responded to the replacement theory over the years, telling the Call Her Daddy podcast: “Honestly, it's not that bad. It could be worse, right? I feel like I got a good one.”

Stevie Wonder has been faking his blindness, according to certain corners of the internet.

Born prematurely and having developed a condition called retinopathy of prematurity, Wonder's blindness came under scrutiny when he was seen onstage with Paul McCartney at the White House in 2010. During the show, Wonder appeared to catch a mic stand that McCartney knocked over. Cue: insane conjecture that the legendary soul artist has been fooling everyone for decades.

Wonder has spoken openly about his blindness, and has had some fun over the conspiracy that he isn't really blind. In 2017, he said: “This year, I will reveal the truth.”

Drumroll... The truth is that he's blind and people have waaaaay too much time on their hands.

The official story goes that six-year-old JonBenét Ramsey was killed in her parents' home in Boulder, Colorado, on 25 December 1996. On 26 December, she was reported missing and her body was found seven hours later in the basement of the house.

The case remains unsolved, an open homicide that has led some to suspect that she could still be alive. Don't ask – it's weird. But if you haven't seen Kitty Green's 2017 documentary Casting JonBenet, make that your next watch.

One of the more far-fetched theories regarding the death of the young beauty queen is that she remained hidden until 2008 and resurfaced as none other than Katy Perry.

It doesn't make a lick of sense.

Not so Crazy in Love: Why is Donald Trump demanding that Beyoncé be prosecuted? 

Can we stop pretending the Katy Perry-Blue Origin space trip was anything but a crass PR stunt?

While most celebs only have one conspiracy theory to their name, Beyoncé has too many to mention.

Her sister is her daughter! She had a secret surrogate! She's older than she says she is! She's behind Michael Jackson's death and knew all about P-Diddy! Artists thank her in their acceptance speeches so she'll spare their lives! Her album 'Renaissance' is a harbinger of the Apocalypse! It's... a lot.

The one that seems to come back the most though is that she's part of the Illuminati, peppering her music, on stage shows and public appearances with mind-control symbolism linked to the secret society... Brainwashing gestures like the triangle – which is actually a reference to her husband Jay-Z's ROC label sign.

Conspiracy theorists just won't see reason when it comes to Queen Bey, believing that she's conspiring to control world affairs and rule the world as the supreme head of the Enlightenment-era clique.

But considering the current state of play, wouldn't the world be better off as one giant Bey Hive? Food for thought.

The owner of a skincare brand has spoken about being part of Charlotte Tilbury's founding team, setting up a business and appearing on Dragons' Den.

Danielle Close, from Hove, is the founder of My Skin Feels, a sustainable skincare brand which uses by-products from organic tomato ketchup, olive oil, breakfast oats and orange juice manufacturing.

These ingredients are fermented and reformulated into skin-strengthening products suitable for even the most sensitive and eczema-prone skin.

Danielle, who is Brighton born and bred, went to Brighton University but left after a year to become a makeup artist. After training at a London makeup school, she became part of the founding Charlotte Tilbury team.

She was just 19 when she became Tilbury's intern, moving on to become a PA and rising up the ranks first as a social media and finally marketing executive. She travelled the world working behind the scenes at fashion shows and award ceremony parties.

“It was total fate,” Danielle said. “I was at the very beginning of the brand and really young.

"Start-up life is all hands on deck. It was amazing and she's amazing, and I learned a lot from her. I learned to never accept no for an answer, as well as her tenacity and drive – that's now innately in me thanks to her.”

Eventually, the 34-year-old decided she preferred the “natural wellness” side of the industry and spent some time working for sustainable fashion and natural beauty brands, as well as working on the shop floor at Neal's Yard Remedies.

In 2023 she launched My Skin Feels from her flat behind Hove Station.

“The beauty industry is so messed up and unsustainable,” she said. “It's not just putting it in packaging, it's where the ingredients are coming from.”

Manufactured locally in the UK, My Skin Feels products are over 99 per cent natural, vegan and packaged in recyclable aluminium tubes. Thanks to their upcycled orange juice, no "new water" is used in the products, and the brand donates one per cent of sales to the Brighton and Hove Food Partnership to help fight food waste locally.

The food is rescued from the by-products of Italian manufacturing and is fermented for its antioxidants and amino acids.

Could this restaurant be offering one of the most unique pizzas in Brighton?

The brand is “very simple” and comprises only two products: a cleanser and a moisturiser.

“It has all the values of Brighton; it's not about you look but how you feel,” said Danielle.

Danielle is also a psychic medium, a gift she says she was born with and which runs in her family. She trained in mediumship for seven years and sees clients once a week.

The entrepreneur took the brand on hit BBC business show Dragons' Den, asking for £50,000 for ten per cent of the business.

The pitch was filmed a year ago, so Danielle has spent a year “sitting” on the secret of her appearance.

“The last three years I've been on my own," she said.

"Everyone launches online but we've done the opposite; rain or shine I've been at a market. I'm lucky I'd had the experience of practising pitching.”

In an episode aired on Thursday (February 5), the Dragons praised Danielle's “brilliant” pitch, saying they loved her “energy” and describing her as a “really good storyteller”.

Peter Jones, Deborah Meaden and guest investor Gary Neville all offered Danielle all the money she asked for, but for 20 per cent of the business. At the time, she accepted the offer, to be split between Meaden and Neville.

But since then, she has taken to social media to explain that she hasn't ended up accepting the dragons' investment.

She said she left the Den feeling “really bummed out” after the Dragons doubled the stake she wanted to give away.

“For a few days after filming I was really disappointed and I was disappointed because I knew that was not the right decision to make for the business,” she said in a video posted online.

“20 per cent for £50,000 – no matter who it is, celebrity or not celebrity – is not the value of the hard work I put in and it just felt wrong.”

While waiting for the Dragons' investment, some angel investors approached Danielle and offered her a “much bigger amount of money for a much smaller percentage”. In the end, she accepted the angels' investment instead of the Dragons' investment.

An angel investor is an individual or group that provides funding to early-stage startups.

Danielle insisted the decision was not a “snub” to Neville and Meaden.

“I need to make the right decision for myself and my life, and my angels came forward and saved the day.”

Former President Barack Obama speaks at the Obama Foundation Democracy Forum, Dec. 5, 2024, in Chicago.

Editor

Former President Barack Obama said in an interview published Saturday that aliens are “real,” but added that he hadn't seen them. 

Asked by progressive podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen about the existence of extraterrestrial life, the former president responded: “They're real.”

“But I haven't seen them. They're not being kept at Area 51. There's no underground facility—unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the President of the United States.”

The interviewer did not ask a follow-up question on the topic. 

The brevity of Obama's comment sparked a frenzy of speculation online, prompting the former president to issue a clarification on Instagram 24 hours later. 

"I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it's gotten attention let me clarify," he wrote." 

"Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we've been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!"

The former president also spoke out about the recent deployment of thousands of immigration agents to Minnesota, condemning what he described as “rogue behavior” of the federal government during the months-long enforcement surge.

Obama compared the actions of the Trump Administration in Minnesota to behavior that “we've seen in authoritarian countries and we've seen in dictatorships, but we have not seen in America.”

“It is important for us to recognize the unprecedented nature of what ICE was doing in Minneapolis, St. Paul, the way that federal agents, ICE agents were being deployed, without any clear guidelines, training, pulling people out of their homes, using five-year-olds to try to bait their parents,” he said, referring to the case of 5-Year-Old Liam Conejo Ramos.  

“So the rogue behavior of agents of the federal government is deeply concerning and dangerous, but we should take a moment to appreciate the extraordinary outpouring of organizing, community building, decency, neighbors buying groceries for folks, accompanying children to school, teachers who were standing up for their kids, not just randomly, but in a systematic, organized way, citizens saying, “this is not the America we believe in,'” he said.

Obama, whom Trump succeeded in 2017, had previously spoken out against the federal immigration operations in Minneapolis following the killings of Alex Pretti and Renee Good by federal agents. 

In a statement with his wife Michelle posted on X after Pretti's death, Obama claimed that Trump and officials in his Administration “seem eager to escalate the situation” instead of “trying to impose some semblance of discipline and accountability over the agents they've deployed.”

“This has to stop,” Obama said. “I would hope that after this most recent tragedy, Administration officials will reconsider their approach.” 

The Trump Administration said Thursday it is winding down its massive immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota following months of unrest over excessive use of force by immigration officers in the state, including the shooting deaths of Pretti and Good.

“I have proposed and President Trump has concurred that this surge operation conclude,” border czar Tom Homan told reporters in a press conference in Minneapolis on Thursday.

President Donald Trump sent Homan, his top immigration advisor, to Minnesota late last month to address large-scale protests over excessive use of force by immigration officers in the state. Homan took over leadership of “Operation Metro Surge” from Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino and quickly set up meetings with local and state leaders, including sheriffs, police chiefs, Governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison. 

Obama also responded indirectly to the recent controversy over a video posted by President Donald Trump that depicted him and First Lady Michelle Obama as apes. 

When asked about it, Obama commented on how there is a "sort of clown show that's happening in social media and on television.” 

"What is true is there doesn't seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sense of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office. So that's been lost," he added.

Trump has refused to apologize for posting the video, saying he instructed a staffer to share it but that he had not seen the offending part.

"I didn't see the whole thing," Trump said. "I looked at the first part, and it was really about voter fraud in the machines, how crooked it is, how disgusting it is. Then I gave it to the people. Generally, they look at the whole thing. But I guess somebody didn't."

TIME has approached the White House for comment.
