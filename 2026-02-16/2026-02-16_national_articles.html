The 74-year-old actress told Fox News Digital she is "grateful" for her health and to still have a career in Hollywood. Jane Seymour shared her secrets to staying fit and healthy as she celebrated turning 75. During a recent interview with the Daily Mail, the actress, who marked her milestone birthday on Sunday, revealed how she has stayed a size 4 since she was a teenager and detailed her approach to dieting. "I love the Mediterranean way of eating, it works so well, and it tastes good, it includes a lot of delicious food like tomatoes, olives and fish," the "Somewhere in Time" star said. Seymour explained that she enjoys light breakfasts and only eats one main meal a day around 1:30pm. "I start the day with coffee and hard-boiled eggs for protein, and it isn't till later, around lunchtime, that I have a full meal because then I can really enjoy it," she said. "I love fish and vegetables, and grow many greens in my backyard, which I love to use." The U.K. native said her afternoon snacks include vegetables with hummus, pistachios and other nuts, noting that she prefers savory foods to sweets. "I do love nuts," she told the Daily Mail. Seymour emphasized that she doesn't believe in dieting, only in eating healthy foods that she enjoys rather than restricting herself. "People ask me if I have a cheat day with my diet and I respond that I am never on a diet, I just make good choices and stick with them," she said. "Being healthy just feels good, it keeps me going, it gives me energy," she added. Seymour noted that her exercise routine includes lifting light weights and Pilates. Seymour explained that she follows a Mediterranean diet. "First of all, heart disease has run in my family, so I go to the doctor and I regularly get tested to see where I'm at and what I need to do," she said. It's the number one cause of death for women." She explained that she doesn't believe in following diets but instead makes healthy food choices. While speaking with Fox News Digital earlier this month, Seymour shared how she was planning to celebrate her 75th birthday. "For the actual day of my birthday, I have no idea," she said. "It usually rains a lot, and it's right next to Valentine's Day, so I might do what the Queen of England used to do and just have my official birthday on another day, when the sun is shining and we can all be outside." Seymour also reflected on aging, telling Fox News Digital that she feels like she is "in my prime right now." Seymour recently told Fox News Digital that she feels like she's "in my prime right now." "I'm grateful to have amazing work, work with great people who I love," the "Harry Wilde" star said. "Oh gosh, I don't even have time for everything I'm doing right now, it's insane," she added. "Mercifully, I have the energy for it. Ashley Hume is an entertainment writer for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FBI agents are seen at the Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center, Wednesday, Jan. 28, 2026, in Union City, Ga, near Atlanta. Georgia General Election 2020 ballots are loaded by the FBI onto trucks at the Fulton County Election HUB, Wednesday, Jan. 28, 2026, in Union City, Ga., near Atlanta. The Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center, is seen Wednesday, Jan. 28, 2026, in Union City, Ga, near Atlanta, as FBI agents search at the main election facility. ATLANTA (AP) — The NAACP and other organizations are asking a judge to protect personal voter information that was seized by the FBI from an elections warehouse just outside Atlanta. Georgia residents entrusted the state with their “sensitive personal information” when they registered to vote, and the Jan. 28 seizure of ballots and other election documents from the Fulton County elections hub “breached that guarantee, infringed constitutional protections of privacy, and interfered with the right to vote,” the organizations said in a motion filed late Sunday. That includes prohibiting any efforts to use it for voter roll maintenance, election administration or immigration enforcement. The Department of Justice did not immediately respond Monday to a request for comment on the motion. FBI agents arrived at the elections hub just south of Atlanta with a search warrant seeking documents related to the 2020 election in Fulton County, including: all ballots, tabulator tapes from the scanners that tally the votes, electronic ballot images created when the ballots were counted and then recounted, and all voter rolls. President Donald Trump has fixated on Fulton, a Democratic stronghold and the most populous county in the state, asserting without evidence that widespread voter fraud there cost him victory in Georgia in 2020. An FBI agent's affidavit presented to a magistrate judge to obtain the search warrant says the criminal investigation began with a referral from Kurt Olsen, who advised Trump as he tried to overturn his 2020 election loss and now serves as Trump's “director of election security and integrity” with a mission to investigate Trump's loss. It notes that the seizure happened as the Justice Department has been seeking unredacted state voter registration rolls. The Justice Department has sued at least 23 states and the District of Columbia to try to get them to hand over detailed voter information. The agency has said it is seeking the data as part of an effort to ensure election security, but Democratic officials and other critics worry that federal officials want to use the sensitive data for other purposes. Federal courts in several states have rejected the Justice Department's attempts to get the records. “These repeated efforts to access 2020 election records, including by the entity that now has custody of them, heightens concerns about the privacy and security of sensitive voter data and exacerbates the chill on voting rights,” the motion says.</p>

A 21-year-old hiker died after slipping off the trail near the summit of Mount Marcy, New York's tallest peak, authorities said. Officials have not released the hiker's name or gender. The NYSDEC did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment, but a spokesperson for the state government agency told the Adirondack Daily Enterprise the hiker had called 911 at 3:05 p.m., saying they slipped and were unable to get back onto the trail. Mount Marcy is seen on a spring evening after skiing from the summit on June 5, 3017. A dog was with the victim, and it was not immediately clear whether anyone else was hiking with them or what caused the slip. Two forest rangers tried to locate the hiker from a State Police helicopter, but heavy cloud cover around Mount Marcy's summit prevented them from making visual contact, a NYSDEC spokesperson told the outlet. Around 6:06 p.m., one of the rangers was dropped at the Marcy Dam Outpost — roughly five miles from and nearly 3,000 feet below the summit — to begin a ground search. The dog was found alive and was led off the mountain by rangers, officials said, but poor weather conditions initially prevented crews from recovering the hiker's body. Hikers gather near the summit of Mount Marcy, the highest peak in New York state, in Adirondack Park, Feb. 6, 2020. A State Police helicopter transported two forest rangers to the site on Friday morning, where they were able to recover the hiker's remains. Ashley Carnahan is a writer at Fox News Digital.

Australian women's tennis player Destanee Aiava announced Saturday that the 2026 season will be her last in a scathing statement about the sport posted on her social media. Aiava, 25, described tennis as her "toxic boyfriend" in the statement posted on Instagram. Destanee Aiava during her match against Danielle Collins at the Australian Open at Melbourne Park on Jan. 16, 2025. She wrote that tennis gave her some of her best friends and she was able to travel to places she only dreamed of. "I want to say a ginormous f--- you to everyone in the tennis community who's ever made me feel less than," her statement continued. "F--- you to every single gambler who's sent me hate or death threats. F--- you to the people who sit behind screens on social media, commenting on my body, my career, or whatever the f--- they want to nitpick. Behind the white outfits and traditions is a culture that's racist, misogynistic, homophobic and hostile to anyone who doesn't fit its mould. Destanee Aiava reacts after winning a set against Greet Minnen at Sobeys Stadium in Toronto on Aug. 5, 2024. "Life is not meant to be lived in misery or half a--ed. My ultimate goal is to be able to wake up everyday and genuinely say I love what I do – which I think everyone deserves the chance at. But that's better than living a life that's misaligned, or being around constant comparison and losing yourself." Aiava, then, thanked those who supported her career. She has 10 International Tennis Federation titles on her resume and is 269-178 in singles matches. In Grand Slam events, she hasn't made it further than the second round – which came during the 2025 Australian Open.

The man accused of carrying out a Hanukkah terror attack in Sydney, Australia, was seen publicly for the first time Monday, appearing by video link from Goulburn Supermax prison during a hearing at Downing Center Local Court. 7NewsAustralia reported that Naveed Akram, 24, spoke only briefly during the less than 10-minute hearing as a suppression order protecting the names of some victims was extended. A court sketch depicts accused Bondi shooter Naveed Akram appearing via video link from Goulburn Supermax prison at Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney, Monday, Feb. 16, 2026. Akram has been charged with one count of committing a terrorist act, 15 counts of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder, and additional firearms and explosives offenses, according to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions website. The most serious charges carry potential life imprisonment. Rabbi Eli Schlanger, 10-year-old Matilda and French national Dan Elkayam were victims of the Bondi Beach attack. Akram's lawyer, Ben Archbold, told reporters it was too early to indicate how his client would plead, according to 7NewsAustralia. "There's a client that needs to be represented. And we don't let our personal view get in the way of our professional application," Archbold said. His next court appearance is scheduled for April 8. Police teams take security measures at Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia, after a terrorist attack targeting the Jewish community during the first night of Hanukkah. The 24-year-old is accused of carrying out Australia's deadliest terror attack targeting a Jewish "Hanukkah by the Sea" celebration at Bondi Beach in December. His father, Sajid Akram, 50, was shot and killed in a gun battle with police at the scene. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described the Bondi attack as an "ISIS-inspired atrocity," saying at a press conference at Parliament House in Canberra late last year that the government had been informed by the Office of National Intelligence of an ISIS online video feed reinforcing that assessment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When news breaks, you need to understand what actually matters. At Vox, our mission is to help you make sense of the world — and that work has never been more vital. But we can't do it on our own. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The quiet economic miracle hiding in your grocery bill. Everything about the American economy right now feels weird. But here's a number that, if you think hard enough, is stranger — at least historically — than all the rest: 10.4 percent. A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world. That's the share of their disposable income that Americans spent on food in 2024, according to the USDA's Economic Research Service. That's groceries, restaurants, even the occasional ill-advised 11 pm burrito delivery. And it all adds up to about a dime of every dollar. That might sound like a lot if you've been staring at your ever-growing grocery receipt lately or when the New York Times is discovering Americans who apparently spend over a quarter of their income on DoorDash delivery. But let me put it in context. In 1901, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics conducted its first major household expenditure survey, the average American family spent 42.5 percent of its budget on food — not on food and housing and everything else, just food. At today's median household income, that would be the equivalent of roughly $2,600 a month going to the grocery store. In 1947, Americans were still spending 23 percent of their income on groceries alone — and that was before accounting for restaurants. The long, quiet decline from 42 percent to 10 percent is one of the most consequential economic trends in American history, one that has as much to do with Americans getting richer as it has to do with the price of food. The man who first noticed this pattern was a German statistician named Ernst Engel — and before you ask, no, not the Engels with Marx and the Communist Manifesto. (The overlap has been causing confusion in econ classrooms for over a century.) In 1857, Ernst Engel analyzed roughly 200 working-class family budgets from Belgium and noticed something striking: Poor families spent 60 to 70 percent of their income on food, while wealthier families spent under 50 percent. This became known as Engel's Law, and it remains one of the most durable empirical findings in all of economics — confirmed across countries, centuries, and every dataset anyone has thrown at it. The reason Engel's Law matters so much is that food spending as a share of income is, in effect, a freedom index. Food comes first, and when you're spending two-thirds of your paycheck just to eat, there's almost nothing left for education, health care, savings, recreation — all the things that make life more than mere survival. As that share falls, the rest of life can open up. In 1850, the majority of American workers labored on farms — today, it's under 2 percent. From 1866 to 1936, corn yields were essentially flat at about 26 bushels per acre. Then came hybrid corn, synthetic fertilizer, mechanization, and modern genetics. By 1950, yields had crept up to 38 bushels per acre. That's a sevenfold increase in what one acre of ground can produce. Americans today have access to food from every continent, in every season, at prices that would have baffled their grandparents. And it's not just an American story, though America sits at the extreme end. Globally, the pattern holds exactly as Engel predicted: Nigerians spend about 59 percent of their consumption expenditures on food at home. Americans are under 7 percent — among the lowest seen in cross-country data. Of course, you might think that's great, but how come a dozen eggs were costing me $6 not that long ago? Egg prices spiked 8.5 percent in 2024 alone, thanks to avian flu. The “crisis” was effectively a return to early-'90s prices — which themselves would have seemed miraculously low to anyone living in the 1950s. Americans as a whole are actually spending less of their budgets on food away from home than before the pandemic and more on groceries. People under 25 have shifted the most toward cooking at home. The aggregate picture is not “Americans are blowing their paychecks on delivery apps.” It's “Americans are tightening their belts on eating out because groceries got more expensive.” That's a real affordability concern — but it's a very different story than the one going viral on social media. None of this means America's food system is a simple triumph. The 10.4 percent figure is an average, and averages hide things. That's a fourfold gap between rich and poor; Engel's Law still at work in the modern United States. SNAP alone served roughly 42 million people per month in 2023, but the underlying disparity is large and persistent. Then, there's what cheap food is actually made of. The downstream consequences have been obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, and they've created costs that don't show up on your grocery receipt but absolutely show up in the health care system. American farming's environmental footprint — greenhouse gas emissions, fertilizer runoff that feeds dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico, biodiversity loss from monoculture cropping — represents a set of externalized costs that consumers never directly pay. I don't want to minimize any of these serious problems, but I also don't think they invalidate the core achievement. The fact that the average American family can feed itself on roughly a tenth of its income — something that would have seemed like science fiction to Ernst Engel, poring over those Belgian household budgets in 1857 — is a genuine civilizational achievement. That's human freedom, measured one grocery receipt at a time. A version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Team USA's Amber Glenn celebrates with her gold medal after the figure skating team event at the 2026 Winter Olympics, in Milan, Italy, Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026. From left, Ellie Kam, Alysa Liu, and Amber Glenn of Team USA react after receiving their gold medals for the figure skating team event at the 2026 Winter Olympics, in Milan, Italy, Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026. MILAN (AP) — The trio of U.S. women targeting Olympic figure skating gold Tuesday night are not the dainty ice princesses of yesteryear. There's Amber Glenn, a 26-year-old powerhouse and LGBTQ+ rights activist whose career took off just when most figure skaters are contemplating retirement. Then there's Alysa Liu, the one-time phenom who retired at 16 only to launch a comeback that resulted in the first world title for an American woman in nearly two decades. Liu's blond-and-brunette striped hair, prominent frenulum piercing and nonconformist aura have made the 20-year-old a hero of the alt, punk and emo crowd. And there's Isabeau Levito, perhaps the closest thing to the innocent image of teen predecessors like Tara Lipinski and Sarah Hughes, right up until you get the 18-year-old away from the cameras, and her searing wit and biting sarcasm shine through. They've dubbed themselves the “Blade Angels,” an homage to “Charlie's Angels,” after rejecting such suggestions as “Powerpuff Girls” and “Babes of Glory,” which they worried might lead to some trademark issues. (As if they needed more of those in Milan.) They are a new kind of role model for a new generation of American girls. They also are the last chance to salvage a disappointing Olympics for American figure skaters. I think it's really great, because while we all have the same passion for the sport, and we have very aligned goals.” She's represented the U.S. internationally for nearly 15 years, which happens to be how old Lipinski was when she won Olympic gold. It's hard to get more unabashedly American. “I hope I can use my platform and voice throughout these Games to help people stay strong during these hard times,” she said. “A lot of people will say, ‘You're just an athlete. Glenn probably wouldn't have taken such a bold stance a decade ago, when she nearly quit the sport. But over the course of her career, she's tackled head-on an eating disorder, which is all-too common in the sport. And she came to understand her sexuality; Glenn identifies as pansexual, meaning she is attracted to people regardless of sex or gender. “I've been through a lot,” Glenn told The Associated Press. Now, she has an Olympic gold medal from her Winter Games debut after helping the U.S. defend its title in the team event. Whenever people would ask me, ‘Oh, should my kids get into it?' I would be like, ‘No, never,'” Glenn said. “But I've seen the people around me grow, and how the environment of figure skating has changed, and how we're trying to change it. But much like Glenn, she had come to loathe the sport by the time she finished sixth at the Beijing Games, so much so that she quit entirely. I didn't care about my programs. I just wanted to, like, get away. I want nothing to do with that. It took walking away for Liu to finally find herself. The same kid who'd get dropped off at the rink by her father in the morning and picked up at night, and who thirsted for friends her age while living and training alone in Colorado, began to explore: Liu climbed to the base camp of Mt. Everest, ticked off items on her ever-growing bucket list, and enrolled at UCLA to study, perhaps fittingly, psychology. Met so many new people,” Liu said. “I had to exercise my free will and push myself in different ways.” She began contemplating a comeback two years ago, after she went skiing and experienced an adrenaline rush unlike anything she'd felt since hanging up the skates. Liu didn't know where it would lead — certainly not the first world title for an American since Kimmie Meissner in 2006, and definitely not another Winter Games — but she knew that she loved the feeling of skating again. Everything in Liu's life has meaning now, including the striking horizontal stripes in her hair. They're meant to represent the growth rings of a tree. There are three of them at present, and like a tree, Liu plans to add another ring each year. “I used to feel like a puppet or a canvas that other people were using,” she said. Levito has always admired Russian skater Evgenia Medvedeva, perhaps the most dominant women's skater of the mid-2000s, who was heavily favored to win gold at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games but wound up with the silver medal instead. I just wanted to have that angelic energy that I feel like she has,” Levito told the AP. My style is, I don't know, put together. I don't know how to word it. “The ice princess image,” Levito said, after a long pause, “which is silly to say.” Mostly because it is just that — an image. Yes, there is a sense of purity surrounding Levito, whose mother, Chiara, immigrated to the U.S. from Milan three decades ago, and whose grandmother still lives in the host city of the Winter Games. Figure Skating Championships, Levito was asked her favorite quality in Liu, who was sitting beside her. “I want to say something but I won't,” Levito said, before succumbing to a little prodding: “She keeps the hoes on their toes,” she said. “I think it's so funny,” Levito said later, reflecting on that day. “The internet is like, ‘Our Isabeau is not a baby anymore,' when they have no idea what you're actually like. She wears a sort of mask for the public, projecting the image she thinks people want to see. Much like Glenn and Liu have people who can relate to them, there are a whole lot of people who can relate to that.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He was never arrested or charged with a crime. The contemporary immigration crackdown has involved campaigns across the country purportedly to enforce existing immigration law, while Japanese Americans were incarcerated under the guise of wartime necessity just based on their ethnicity, even when there was no accusation they had broken any laws. Fort Bliss, a sprawling military base in the desert in El Paso, Texas, where Japanese and Japanese American people, Italians and Germans were held during WWII, has been repurposed for the immigration crackdown. It's now home to Camp East Montana, one of the nation's largest centers for detaining people accused of immigration-related violations, where at least three people in custody have died in the last two months. Like two-thirds of the people incarcerated without charge in 10 prison camps during WWII, Tateishi, now 86, is an American citizen. So were his parents; his grandparents had immigrated to the US from Japan and built their lives in California, he told CNN. Rubio says US does not know whereabouts of 137 Venezuelans deported under the Alien Enemies Act But the US government treated all Japanese immigrants and their descendants as suspect. The Alien Enemies Act of 1798 was used to detain foreign nationals, many of them Japanese, while Executive Order 9066 was used to detain and incarcerate people of Japanese descent from the West Coast en masse, including US citizens. In September, a federal appeals court ruled Trump's use of the act, which deportees say led to months of torture at a mega-prison in El Salvador before they were released in July, was unlawful. Satsuki Ina, who was born behind barbed wire at the Tule Lake Segregation Center, a maximum‑security prison camp in Northern California, said she identifies “completely” with what's happening today. Hiroshi Shimizu, 82, who spent his earliest years in multiple camps, including Tule Lake and Crystal City in Texas, said he didn't fully grasp what had been taken from him until later in life when he saw his grandchildren “going through the same ages that I was when I was in prison and all the wonderful things they're able to do being free.” “I can now see what a terrible thing it was for me to have spent the first five years of my life in prison,” Shimizu told CNN. Decades later, the US acknowledged the imprisonment was based on “race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership” and granted reparation payments of $20,000 to each survivor. Now, according to Tateishi – who helped lead the campaign for reparations – it's as if all that progress has been undone. “It feels like everything that we've held sacred in this country, and that so many people fought for and died for, almost has no meaning,” he said. Just hours after bombs began raining down on Oahu, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, two FBI agents arrived unannounced at Nikki Nojima Louis' home in Seattle's Japantown. They took away her father, who was born in Japan. “After that, we never lived together as a family again,” Louis, now 88, told CNN. Arrested alongside other community leaders, ministers and business owners as a potential security risk, Louis' father was interrogated and later sent to the Justice Department's all‑male “enemy alien” camps in Lordsburg and Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he remained until 1946, a year after the war ended. Louis and her mother were left behind in Seattle – until two months later, in February 1942, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, authorizing the mass removal of people of Japanese ancestry, including US citizens, from the West Coast. Ina's parents – both American citizens – were forced from their San Francisco home and confined to the Tanforan racetrack detention center in San Bruno. After answering “no” to two questions on the government's so‑called loyalty questionnaire, the family was transferred to Tule Lake, where those deemed “disloyal” were held under tighter security. Ina was born there and, along with her family, classified as an “alien enemy,” she said. He was charged with sedition and sent to a federal prison in North Dakota. Tateishi can still remember the day he arrived at Manzanar in California's Owens Valley. “And I didn't understand what it was we had done that caused us to be put behind barbed wire fences.” The West Coast was declared a theater of operations by the then-War Department, which offered commander John L. DeWitt “very broad authority to start issuing curfews, and to start ordering or calling for searches and seizures of homes, even where American citizens live,” Hinnershitz said. “I had this very distinct sense that America was out there somewhere,” he said. “And I had this yearning to find out what it was like.” In December 1944, with WWII drawing to an end, a Supreme Court ruling and a public proclamation paved the way for the camps to close. Japanese Americans were sent home with just a train ticket and $25 each. After their release, former detainees faced financial strife and continued anti-Japanese racism, as well as the unremitting feeling they had been betrayed by the country to which they had worked so hard to assimilate. Ina, whose US-born parents she said were “coerced” to renounce their citizenship in Tule Lake, leaving them stateless for more than a decade, said the ordeal devastated her family. “We were never charged with a crime,” she added. Today, the Trump administration's hardline approach to immigration enforcement has seen activists with green cards locked up for months, masked federal agents grabbing people off the street, the shuttering of programs for refugees and asylum-seekers, and hundreds of workers arrested in chaotic workplace raids. Many people detained and deported have never been charged with a crime. And the Supreme Court has upheld ICE officers' ability to stop people for factors like their race, the language they speak, or their job. In one case captured on video, an agent told a man in a Minneapolis suburb he was being detained because of his accent. Another parallel is the “dehumanizing, racist” rhetoric used by the Trump administration to discuss immigrants, according to Elora Mukherjee, a leading immigration lawyer and professor at Columbia Law School. So too do the lengthy detentions some people experience in massive detention centers. “Nobody dreamed they would be held for up to six years.” Thousands of immigrants are currently being detained in large detention centers where detainees, lawyers and activists have alleged abuse and poor conditions. “There's very little difference, except that those folks that are crossing the border to come over here are coming here in desperation, or survival,” she added. “Most of the Japanese American immigrants came here with hope.” For both Tateishi and Ina, their childhood years in prison camps inspired a mission: To make sure no one else experiences what they did. Tateishi found his path to activism in the 1970s, as anger swelled among young former detainees about their imprisonment, which the government had yet to acknowledge as an injustice. “That was the most gratifying thing of all those years of fighting for Japanese American redress, the fact that it was a commitment to the future that we would never allow it to happen again,” he said. Ina, meanwhile, cofounded Tsuru for Solidarity during Trump's first term, a group she described as “a Japanese American social justice organization that is protesting the current unjust incarceration of immigrants, seeking asylum and protection in our country.” They held protests outside detention centers where children were held, with traditional Japanese drumming and paper cranes – a bid to show them that people on the outside cared about them. During the president's second term, “there's much more anxiety and fear,” among Tsuru members, she said. Elder members are scared about experiencing force from police at protests, or being arrested for protesting what they see as a repetition of an old injustice. “When I see immigrants today being ripped from their homes, grabbed from courthouses and being transferred in shackles to be incarcerated behind barbed wire, I see my grandparents, their parents and siblings and am motivated to take action,” said Becca Asaki, whose family was imprisoned during the war. Tateishi urged people fighting the current wave of detentions and deportations to persevere. “What's important is people don't give up,” he said. Ina said in her work with other survivors of Japanese American prison camps, a recurring sentiment was “the pain they felt that nobody stood up for them.” That silence, she said, is part of the trauma. Most recently, two fatal shootings by immigration officers last month sparked massive demonstrations in Minneapolis, where an aggressive immigration enforcement campaign brought thousands of federal agents. “We will not turn our backs on this repetition of our history and the lifelong legacy of trauma that continues to haunt us today.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the Trump administration has sued 25 mostly Democratic state election chiefs for their voter rolls, it has also encountered quieter resistance from Republican officials who have balked at the Justice Department's demands for confidential voter registration information. At least a half-dozen Republican-led state election offices have declined the Justice Department's request for non-public voter data, which can include a voter's Social Security number, driver license ID number or current residence, according to interviews, local media reporting and records obtained by CNN and by the Brennan Center, a left-leaning think tank that researches election issues. They're gonna pay for it like everybody else,” West Virginia Secretary of State Kris Warner told CNN last month, referring to the public list that can be purchased in his state for $500. “They're not going to get our personal information.” Several other Republican election administrators have provided the sensitive data but refused to sign an agreement proposed by the Trump administration that would require them to remove voters deemed ineligible by the Justice Department. In interviews with CNN about the department's voter data quest, GOP election officials expressed concerns about the administration's approach even though they're aligned with the president on other matters of election security. The voter data crusade is one of several ways the Trump administration is trying to insert itself more directly into election-related tasks carried out by states. Trump has not let go of his unfounded fixation on mass voter fraud. He has called on Republicans to nationalize elections, installed fellow 2020 election deniers in the executive branch who are leading reviews of voting infrastructure, and the FBI recently seized 2020 ballots from Fulton County, Georgia. Republicans' objections to the department's voter data project came to head at a mid-December meeting between GOP state election officials and Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, the civil rights chief at DOJ who has been spearheading the data demands. “We were adamant on the idea that maintaining voter rolls should be done on the state level,” Watson, who is also president of the National Association of Secretaries of State, told CNN. Dhillon, in public remarks, has been dismissive of the state officials' concerns. “Some of the goofy responses that I have gotten from secretaries of state have included, ‘Oh, my goodness, this is highly confidential Social Security information. We can't possibly give that to the federal government,'” Dhillon recently told the conservative journalist John Solomon. During the February 2 appearance on Solomon's show, Dhillon hinted that more lawsuits would be filed within one to two weeks against the recalcitrant states. No new voter roll cases have been filed since December. Election officials have pointed to state privacy laws in explaining why they cannot turn over their voters' personal information. “If we could legally comply, we would promptly do so,” Oklahoma State Election Board Secretary Paul Ziriax said in a letter to the Department this month, first reported by Oklahoma News 4 and obtained by CNN. Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, citing state privacy laws, told his state's legislature this month that he did not intend to produce the data absent a court order. But still, those comparisons have been rife with false positives, CNN previously reported, with naturalized citizens often wrongly identified as ineligible voters because the federal data is outdated. “You can't expect to send me a 45-day window to get this done or else,” Watson told CNN, noting that in Mississippi, removals aren't done by state officials but by county clerks. “We are going to go by Mississippi law and we are going to make sure our voter rolls clean.” Other election officials were wary that the administration might use the data for other purposes and have wondered whether the stated goal — compliance with the National Voter Registration Act mandate of “reasonable efforts” to remove voters who have died or moved — is just a pretext. “They don't need the driver's license, Social Security number and date of birth to make sure that we're making a reasonable effort at maintaining our voter rolls,” a Republican elections official in another state told CNN. “If states don't give this information and then Republicans lose and they can go back and say, ‘See, it's because they didn't give us this information, so they cheated and all these illegal people that shouldn't have been voting voted,'” the official said. Initially, state officials received letters from the Justice Department seeking information last spring and summer about their list maintenance practices and data from their rolls. A handful of Republican-led states complied without objection, but as other officials raised privacy concerns, the administration drafted the Memorandum of Understanding that promised compliance with federal privacy law while laying out the list review process that would be driven by the feds. When the letters landed in election office inboxes in December, the DOJ gave states just seven days to respond and followed up with both emails and phone calls. As it was ramping up pressure on Republicans, the Justice Department was rolling out new rounds of lawsuits against Democratic state officials for noncompliance. “You may have seen in the news that we have sued six states earlier this week for refusing to provide their voter registration lists,” another DOJ lawyer said in a December 4 voicemail left with an official in the Idaho secretary of state's office that was obtained by Idaho Capital Sun. But I haven't heard anything back from you all,” the DOJ attorney, who has since left the department, said. Only two states — Alaska and Texas — have signed the memorandum, according to DOJ correspondence obtained by CNN, while about a dozen more are turning it over without entering the agreement, officials have said in court proceedings. CNN's Fredreka Schouten and Marshall Cohen contributed to this report.</p>

The CSD analysis found that domestic fuel prices in Hungary were on average 18% higher than in the neighboring Czech Republic in 2025, even though Budapest still buys cheaper Russian oil, while Prague buys costlier non-Russian alternatives. The research undercuts Orbán's claims that continuing to buy Russian oil, despite European Union-wide efforts to phase out Russian fossil fuels, makes fuel cheaper for Hungarians. Instead, the report found, the savings are accruing mostly to MOL, Hungary's oil giant, which has seen its operating income soar 30% since Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “The dependence on discounted Russian oil has not trickled down to consumers,” Martin Vladimirov, director of CSD's energy and climate program, told CNN. CNN has asked the Hungarian government and MOL for comment. After Russia launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, EU members moved to end their dependence on Russian oil and gas. The EU gave Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – three Central European countries especially dependent on Russia for their energy – an exemption in 2022 and were told to reduce their reliance as soon as possible. Last year, Russia accounted for over 92% of Hungary's crude oil imports, up from 61% pre-invasion, the report said. When the United States announced sanctions on two Russian oil giants in October, Orbán traveled to the White House to ask for one-year exemption. Although US President Donald Trump granted his ally's request, saying it had been “difficult” for Hungary to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels, since it is landlocked. But the CSD researchers said Hungary's continued purchases of Russian oil are a political choice, not a commercial or logistical necessity. “Despite full access to alternative supply routes… Hungary has deepened its dependence on Russian oil, turning a temporary EU exemption into a permanent loophole in the sanctions regime,” the report said. Hungary receives Russian crude oil through the Druzhba pipeline, which runs through Ukraine, but it is also connected to the Adria pipeline, which runs through Croatia and pumps non-Russian crude oil from the Adriatic coast. The CSD researchers said the Adria pipeline “has sufficient capacity” to meet Hungarian and Slovak demand, and that its transit fees are 1.7 times lower than those for the Druzhba pipeline, which runs through an active war zone. Russian crude oil is, however, significantly cheaper than non-Russian alternatives. The report found that, between January 2024 and August 2025, Russian crude oil was on average roughly 20% cheaper than non-Russian alternatives. But that discount has not translated into lower prices for Hungarian consumers, according to the report. Last year, average weekly pre-tax fuel prices were 18% higher in Hungary than in the Czech Republic and 10% higher for diesel, the CSD said. Even though MOL bought Russian crude at a steep discount, the researchers said the company has still sold its products at prices similar to other regional markets, causing its profits to soar. “The company's operating income rose 30% above pre-invasion levels, while three foundations linked to Prime Minister Viktor Orbán control 30.49% of MOL, enabling surplus profits to flow into some of Hungary's most influential state-capture networks,” it said. Those foundations include the Mathias Corvinus Collegium, Hungary's largest educational institution, which has close ties to Orbán's government. Before Trump granted Hungary the one-year sanctions exemption, he had berated US allies for “inexcusably” continuing to purchase Russian oil, which he said was tantamount to “funding the war against themselves.” But at a joint news conference in Budapest on Monday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the exemption was granted “as much as anything else because of the relationship” between Orbán and Trump. The report also undermines Orbán's claims that Hungary has no option but to purchase Russian oil. It found that Hungary's refineries are technically capable of processing non-Russian crude and have done so in the past without disruptions. “The final stage of Europe's energy decoupling from Russia is within reach.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Monday it completed a new housing district in Pyongyang for families of North Korean soldiers killed while fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, the latest effort by leader Kim Jong Un to honor the war dead. State media photos showed Kim Jong Un walking through the new street — called Saeppyol Street — and visiting the homes of some of the families with his increasingly prominent daughter, believed to be named Kim Ju Ae, as he pledged to repay the “young martyrs” who “sacrificed all to their motherland.” In recent months, North Korea has intensified propaganda glorifying troops deployed to fight in Russia's war against Ukraine, such as establishing a memorial wall and building a museum. Analysts see it as an effort to bolster internal unity and curb potential public discontent. Kim in recent months has sent thousands of troops and large quantities of military equipment, including artillery and missiles, to fuel Russian President Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine, as the leaders align in the face of their separate confrontations with Washington. South Korea's National Intelligence Service told lawmakers last week it estimated 6,000 North Korean troops have been killed or wounded during their deployment in the war, but did not provide a breakdown of fatalities. The agency said last year it believed roughly 600 had died. The spy agency believes North Korean forces are gaining modern combat experience and Russian technical support that could improve the performance of their weapons systems, according to lawmakers who attended last week's closed-door briefing. The construction of the new street comes as North Korea prepares to open a major ruling party congress later this month, where Kim is expected to announce his major goals in domestic and foreign policy over the next five years and take further steps to tighten his control.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Defense chiefs from two major US allies have issued a rare public plea for people across Europe to support big boosts in defense spending to deter a possible war with an increasingly westward-looking Russia. The highest-ranking officials from Germany and the United Kingdom warned that European nations “must now confront uncomfortable truths” about its security and make “hard choices” about spending in an article jointly published by The Guardian in the UK and Die Welt in Germany. “Moscow's military buildup, combined with its willingness to wage war on our continent, as painfully evidenced in Ukraine, represents an increased risk that demands our collective attention,” Germany's chief of defense, Gen. Carsten Breuer, and the UK's chief of defense staff, Air Marshal Sir Richard Knighton, wrote. “It's clear that the threats we face demand a step change in our defence and security,” the pair wrote. “Rearmament is not warmongering; it is the responsible action of nations determined to protect their people and preserve peace,” they said. The article comes on the heels of the weekend's Munich Security Conference, where US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on Europe to assume more responsibility for its own defense after relying for decades on Washington's help as the backbone of its security. The defense chiefs' article notes that NATO leaders have already committed to spending 5% of gross domestic product on defense by 2035. “People must understand the difficult choices governments have to take in order to strengthen deterrence,” the two defense chiefs wrote. But even in their own countries, the message may be a tough sell. In Germany, only 24% of the public favors increased defense spending if other programs would suffer, according to a recent Politico poll. “Defence cannot be the preserve of uniformed personnel alone. It is a task for each and every one of us,” they wrote. Besides the pledge to increase defense spending, the defense chiefs said their countries are taking concrete steps to improve readiness and deterrence, with Britian building six new munitions factories and Germany repositioning troops near its eastern border. The British Defense Ministry also announced over the weekend that it will send an aircraft carrier strike group led by the HMS Prince of Wales to the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans this year “to deter Russian aggression and protect vital undersea infrastructure.” The strike group, which will include the carrier's F-35 fighter jets, will work with US, European and Canadian forces during its deployment, a ministry statement said. “This deployment will help make Britain warfighting ready, boost our contribution to NATO, and strengthen our operations with key allies, keeping the UK secure at home and strong abroad,” Defense Secretary John Healy said in a statement.</p>

(AP Photo/Nigel Cook) Tyler Reddick won “The Great American Race” on Sunday with a last-lap pass at Daytona International Speedway that sent Jordan into a frantic celebration. Jordan, who turns 63 on Tuesday, will get a Daytona 500 ring for his birthday and made it known in victory lane he wears a size 13. The moment captured the message team co-owner Denny Hamlin — who finished 31st in Sunday's bid to become the third driver in history to win four Daytona 500s — delivered to 23XI employees in a team meeting ahead of NASCAR's season opener. “He loves his race team,” Hamlin said, adding he reminded the team of the fulfillment they saw in Jordan when Reddick won at Talladega in 2024. You have that power and nobody else can do it.' “There's nothing else that can bring him the joy that seeing what his team can do and they took it to heart.” “Just incredible how it all played out. “I've already lost my voice from screaming. Reddick opened last year with a runner-up finish in the Daytona 500. He snapped the 38-race losing streak by finishing one place higher Sunday and winning to start a celebration that included multiple stars of NASCAR. It included Jordan, a global icon, and Hamlin, at 45 the oldest full-time driver in the Cup Series. Reddick is teammates with Bubba Wallace, who went to victory lane in tears after leading a race-high 40 laps before finishing 10th. Jordan wrapped his arms around Wallace from behind and spoke closely into Wallace's ear in a brief speech of encouragement. “I don't want my emotions to take away from the monumental day they just accomplished. That's a massive birthday present,” Wallace said. “Led a lot of laps, lap leader, I believe. It was a good day for us, but damn. Hamlin, who drives for Joe Gibbs Racing, was involved in the final caution when he and teammate Christopher Bell collided with nine laps remaining. Reddick made a huge surge with an assist from teammate Riley Herbst, made contact with Elliott that caused Elliott to crash, then sailed past to give Jordan a victory in NASCAR's biggest event of the year. “It's stuff you dream of as a kid,” said Reddick. “Now, I definitely didn't look into the future and know that I would drive for Michael Jordan. But to be able to have someone like Michael Jordan believe in me enough, someone like Denny Hamlin. Jordan watched the win from a suite overlooking the superspeedway built by the France family — NASCAR founders and private owners — that he just beat in federal court. NASCAR chairman Jim France, who was personally a defendant in the suit, went to victory lane to congratulate the winners. It was so gratifying,” Jordan said of the victory. “You never know how these races are going to end. Bob Jenkins, who joined 23XI in suing NASCAR, opened the weekend with a victory when Chandler Smith won the Truck Series opener on Friday night for Front Row Motorsports. Richard Childress, who testified on behalf of 23XI and Front Row and was the subject of disparaging text messages by since-departed NASCAR chairman Steve Phelps, was the winning team owner Saturday when Austin Hill won. Then it was time for Jordan and Hamlin, the two front-facing litigants, as they got their first Daytona 500 victory together. “All we do is win,” shrugged Hamlin, who called the trio of weekend winners “coincidence.” Elliott wound up fourth and sat dejected and in disbelief on the outside wall of the track after climbing from his car. “We ended up kind of getting gifted the lead ... and then at that point in time, you're just on defense.</p>

(Don Campbell/The Herald-Palladium via AP) ATLANTA (AP) — A weekend storm system sweeping across the Southeast brought tornado warnings to Mississippi and Louisiana, and then took aim at parts of Georgia and Florida, as people in the Northeast were finally getting a reprieve from weeks of bitterly cold temperatures. Some of the fiercest weather in the South was reported near Lake Charles, Louisiana, where high winds from a thunderstorm overturned a horse trailer and a Mardi Gras float, damaged an airport jet bridge and flung the metal awning from a house into power lines. Power poles were snapped and toppled near the Louisiana towns of Jena, Cheneyville and Donaldsonville, the weather service reported. No deaths or serious injuries were reported, but the damage reports came as the storm system continued into parts of south Georgia and the Florida Panhandle, which were under tornado watches on Sunday. The storms led to some power outages across southern states, but nowhere near the massive number of outages caused by ice storms late last month in northern Mississippi and Nashville, Tennessee. By Sunday evening, a few thousand customers were still without electricity in Florida, Louisiana, Kentucky and Virginia, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks outages nationwide. Meanwhile, the Northeast was beginning to thaw after a weekslong stretch of uncommonly cold weather. Coast Guard Seaman Leyla Siglam monitors ice breaking from the Coast Guard Cutter Hawser during an ice-clearing operation at Wallabout Bay in the East River in New York, Wednesday, Feb. 11, 2026. Boston was running nearly 7 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 14 Celsius) below average for February last week, and the city was on pace for its coldest winter in more than a decade. Boston remained cold on Sunday, but this week's forecast called for temperatures climbing into the high 30s and low 40s, which is closer to the seasonal average. On the West Coast, much of California braced for a powerful winter storm that was expected to bring drenching thunderstorms, damaging winds and heavy snow in mountain areas. “So if they are traveling, packing winter safety kits. Forecasters said the Sierra Nevada, including ski resorts around Lake Tahoe, could see up to seven feet (two meters) of snow before the storm moves through late Wednesday. To the south, Los Angeles area residents in some neighborhoods scarred by last year's devastating wildfires were under an evacuation warning through Tuesday because of the potential for mud and debris flows.</p>
