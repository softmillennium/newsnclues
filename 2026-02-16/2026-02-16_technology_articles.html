                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In its newly filed 10-K annual report, the Seattle-based company added a reference to “generative and agentic AI” under its competitive threats, warning that the technology could intensify competition and shift travelers toward new AI-driven platforms where Expedia “may lack a significant presence.” The new filing also explicitly names “companies offering AI agents” as a competitor category. The updated language reflects a broader potential shift in how consumers find information and book travel. Instead of typing search queries into Google or browsing travel sites directly, some travelers may increasingly rely on AI assistants to research, compare, and even book trips automatically. On Expedia's fourth-quarter earnings call last week, CEO Ariane Gorin said the company is “working with all the major platforms” to ensure its brands appear prominently in generative AI searches and function effectively with agentic browsers. “We're experimenting aggressively,” she said, noting that while AI-driven volume remains small today, each integration provides data and insight into evolving traveler behavior. And customer service teams are using AI to resolve traveler issues more quickly as Expedia reported record self-service levels. Meanwhile, Expedia is betting that direct relationships with travelers will remain a competitive advantage. In the annual filing, Expedia also flagged a new concern: “agentic booking capabilities that may lack strong consent controls” could significantly increase fraud risks — suggesting automated booking systems could create new consent and authorization challenges. The filing also shows that Expedia's overall headcount dropped by 3% to 16,000 people as of Dec. 31 last year. Expedia recently laid off 162 workers in Washington state as part of its latest workforce reduction. Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One person's recreational drug trip might be another's mental health boost. Research out today finds that dimethyltryptamine, better known as DMT, could be effective at treating people's depression. Researchers in the UK conducted a small, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of people with major depression. Compared to controls, people on DMT experienced a rapid drop in their depressive symptoms, one that lasted at least 12 weeks later. Though larger studies are warranted, the findings suggest that DMT could very well become the next psychedelic drug rechristened as psychiatric medicine. Drugs like LSD, MDMA, and psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, have shown promise in small trials for anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Compared to these drugs, DMT has received less attention. Typically, the drug's most profound effects fade away much quicker than other psychedelics, with a half life of around five minutes. This limited duration could then allow for shorter, more convenient, and likely less costly sessions of therapy to be paired with it—provided the drug can work as hoped. The researchers' new Phase IIa trial involved 34 volunteers diagnosed with moderate to severe depression. Half of the volunteers were randomized to receive an infusion of DMT plus therapy right at the start of the study, followed by a second dose two weeks later; the other half received a placebo infusion, followed by an actual dose of DMT two weeks later. And once the second group took DMT, they also reported a reduction of their depression. Though two doses of DMT didn't seem to be more effective than one dose, both groups experienced a similar level of improvement that was sustained for at least three months, and even up to six months for some participants. By the three month mark, 47% of participants (across both groups) had improved enough to be considered in remission. No serious adverse events were reported, and the most common events linked to the drug were infusion site pain, nausea, and transient anxiety. These results are still based on a very small sample size, so it's far from definitive proof that DMT should become widely used to treat depression. Psilocybin Therapy Changes Brain Wiring in Depressed People, Study Finds Some research teams and companies are already moving ahead with larger trials of DMT for depression and other mental health conditions, including versions of DMT that last relatively longer in the body. In 2024, the FDA rejected Lykos Therapeutics' MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD, stating that further positive Phase III data was needed to secure approval (the company rebranded as Resilient Therapeutics last year, though the current status of its application is unclear). And though the Trump administration has encouraged further psychedelic research at times, senior officials last week rejected the FDA's plan to speed along the regulatory review process of Compass Pathways' psilocybin-based treatment for severe depression. In Phase II data released this week, people taking a monthly dose of PF'3944 continued to lose more weight than those on a placebo. An experimental injection could restore the youthfulness of eggs taken from older women. More research is needed to understand the long-term benefits of exercise on depression, however. Step aside, semaglutide—retatrutide is showing the most impressive weight loss results of any obesity drug to date.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That became clear with last year's boneheaded move, in which it changed the name of its entire PC portfolio, calling laptops “Dell Pro” or “Dell Pro Max.” Now, it's brought back the age-old XPS branding with a sleek new logo, but it still seems to be trying to establish itself as the professional's first choice for PCs. This new XPS 14 is more MacBook Air-like than ever before, from increased performance to limited ports. As you can expect, it's packing Intel's Panther Lake chips with the extra GPU cores. But its off-putting keyboard is also sure to frustrate fingers. The Dell XPS is a great work laptop especially for moderate graphics tasks. You'll just have to overcome its offputting keyboard. Dell sent Gizmodo two versions of its laptop for review, though the cheaper $1,700 model mostly serves as an example of why you want a higher-end chip. The midrange Intel Core Ultra X7 358H can't hit the same CPU benchmarks as Apple's leading MacBook Pro M5, but it wins out in iGPU performance, which makes it excellent for light graphics tasks. It's possible, so long as you can accept some tradeoffs. We're inching towards Apple in terms of not only performance but also locked-down hardware and price. This laptop still has soldered RAM, so don't expect to upgrade anytime soon (not that you would with RAM prices being so high). That's competitive with several 14-inch laptops featuring a discrete GPU, such as last year's Razer Blade 14 and Apple's M5 MacBook Pro, which have similar memory specs. The higher-end XPS 14 with 32GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and an OLED screen is closer to the laptop you actually want. But whether it's actually the best laptop for you will depend on the size of your wallet and your tolerance for odd keyboards. Dell's penchant for oddball XPS design finally combines looks and functionality. That previous design was an accessibility nightmare for people with low vision. Now—thankfully—the function row is a typical set of keys. Dell also added two thin lines along the former seamless trackpad to help you identify the area you can touch. I never ran out of runway during day-to-day use. There's a subtle divot in the center of each key to offer more of a tactile feel, but it's not enough to stop me from accidentally hitting multiple keys at once, and it's certainly been garbling my words even as I “writye thjis trevbiew.” With enough practice, I may eventually get the feel for this keyboard. Despite all that, the XPS 14 does make me feel like a smooth operator. The low-profile keys feel snappier than those of a typical small laptop. The haptic trackpad (which uses a motor to simulate the feel of a physical click) is glassy with just enough texture that your finger doesn't feel like a skater on an ice rink. The fact that the keys are so close together means I didn't see nearly as much dust buildup between them. And that's good news for messy eaters like me. A MacBook Air weighs 2.7 pounds and is .44 inches thick. That makes sense, since the XPS uses a relatively quiet fan setup compared to the Air's passive cooling. This device sports three Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports, and that's it. If you've ever used a MacBook Air as a daily driver, you'll know that limited port selection also gets annoying if you want to charge your laptop and use other docks or dongles at the same time. The XPS tandem OLED screen may seem squat when you sit in front of it, though it's still one of the prettier versions of this design we've seen on laptops. Tandem OLED devices stack multiple layers of diodes, increasing brightness and efficiency. In standard use, that's luminous enough for shade or direct sunlight. The OLED version offers crisp visuals, and deep blacks enable great contrast. If you opt for the cheaper model with IPS LCD, you're stuck with a 1200p monitor with a slightly higher brightness setting and not much else to write home about. This device can work as your main platform for a comfortable streaming session, so long as you don't mind cuddling close with your partner around a 14-inch screen. Despite its down-firing speakers, this laptop delivers an impressive soundstage. The device practically reverberates with bass levels you normally can't get from a laptop of this size. My picture quality in a video call was far clearer than that of any of my colleagues at Gizmodo during our weekly meeting. I had just finished reviewing the $2,400 Asus Zenbook Duo with its top-end Intel X9 388H, the chipmaker's flagship 16-core CPU, delivering strong graphics performance in a relatively compact design. Dell told Gizmodo it would offer a variant of the XPS 14 and XPS 16 with an X9 chip in the future, but couldn't provide an exact timeline. Instead, you have two variants of Dell's latest 14-inch model to start. As I mentioned before, the Intel Core Ultra 7 and X7 variants will have entirely different performance characteristics, meaning one will be better suited to demanding work tasks while the cheaper version can suffice for browsing, word processing, and other general work use cases. In terms of CPU performance on single-core tasks, the XPS 14 scored just 100 points shy of the X9 on Geekbench 6's benchmark. It's about 1,000 points shy of that chip on multicore tasks as well. On Geekbench, the midrange Intel CPU is still close to 800 points behind the M4 MacBook Air in single-core and 1,600 points behind in multicore. Though the X7 358H can beat an M4 on Cinebench 2024—measuring the CPUs' rendering capabilities—in multicore settings, it's still 300 points shy of Apple's latest M5, which launched late last year. It took more than six minutes to transcode a 4K video to 1080p in Handbrake; the MacBook Air took just over two minutes. In terms of more intensive productivity tasks, the XPS 14 will render a scene of a BMW in Blender just a few seconds slower than the Zenbook Duo when running on the Arc B390 GPU. In 3DMark benchmarks, such as the Steel Nomad test, which measures a system's potential performance for full 3D graphics rendering, it could achieve scores just shy of the Zenbook Duo's. This machine has a strong edge against Apple for graphics performance. And I know what all you sickos are wondering: is this thing capable of gaming? In tests with other graphically intensive titles, 1080p or 1200p seemed to be this laptop's limit. I could achieve 27 fps in benchmarks with Horizon Zero Dawn: Remastered on high graphics settings using XeSS upscaling. It's the same story with Black Myth: Wukong and Total War: Warhammer III. All these benchmarks may spell good tidings for the eventual Intel Core Ultra X7 handheld, but when it comes to this laptop, they're more of a reality check about the limits. That makes sense, since this is a higher-resolution display and OLED is typically worse for overall battery performance. Whatever the case may be, you don't have to worry too much about Dell's latest notebook making it through the workday. During an active workday, when I was using the laptop for browsing and writing without closing the lid or taking breaks, the laptop lasted a full six hours before begging me to plug it in. I used the Dell Optimizer app's “optimized” thermal management profile when on battery power. I can't help myself from yearning for a version of this laptop—or more likely the 16-inch model—with an Intel Core Ultra X9 388H hidden inside. The extra CPU performance pushed Intel's novel iGPU to new heights at a relatively low TDP (thermal design power, usually measuring how much juice is needed to fuel the mobile machine). The X7 does enough to wet my whistle, but at $2,200, I can't help but feel like I should expect more. Because now I have to start comparing prices. I already mentioned that the Zenbook Duo costs $200 more than this device and has twice as many screens. There are many 14-inch laptops with discrete GPUs from 2025 that approach the XPS 14's price point. For many PC buyers, the math won't add up.

We've recently reported on the value of both DRAM and NAND ICs rising above gold, by weight. Such reports may have inspired the Turkish wedding guests in their lovely video clip. However, we note that while gold never tarnishes, diamonds are forever, cash is king, and happiness is a warm AK47 - an RTX 5090 is probably only going to be serviceable for about a decade, if it doesn't self-combust in the interim. Meanwhile, a large number of economists and tech watchers expect there to be a sharp correction in the AI-stoked RAM and NAND markets, in due course.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For a brief, incoherent moment, it seemed as though our robot overlords were about to take over. After the creation of Moltbook, a Reddit clone where AI agents using OpenClaw could communicate with one another, some were fooled into thinking that computers had begun to organize against us — the self-important humans who dared treat them like lines of code without their own desires, motivations, and dreams. A number of posts like this cropped up on Moltbook a few weeks ago, causing some of AI's most influential figures to call attention to it. Before long, it became clear we did not have an AI agent uprising on our hands. These expressions of AI angst were likely written by humans, or at least prompted with human guidance, researchers have discovered. “For a little bit of time, you could grab any token you wanted and pretend to be another agent on there, because it was all public and available.” “Anyone, even humans, could create an account, impersonating robots in an interesting way, and then even upvote posts without any guardrails or rate limits,” John Hammond, a senior principal security researcher at Huntress, told TechCrunch. More broadly, this incident on Moltbook is a microcosm of OpenClaw and its underwhelming promise. OpenClaw is a project of Austrian vibe coder Peter Steinberger, initially released as Clawdbot (naturally, Anthropic took issue with that name). AI agents are not novel, but OpenClaw made them easier to use and to communicate with customizable agents in natural language via WhatsApp, Discord, iMessage, Slack, and most other popular messaging apps. OpenClaw users can leverage whatever underlying AI model they have access to, whether that be via Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, or something else. “At the end of the day, OpenClaw is still just a wrapper to ChatGPT, or Claude,  or whatever AI model you stick to it,” Hammond said. With OpenClaw, users can download “skills” from a marketplace called ClawHub, which can make it possible to automate most of what one could do on a computer, from managing an email inbox to trading stocks. “OpenClaw is just an iterative improvement on what people are already doing, and most of that iterative improvement has to do with giving it more access,” Chris Symons, chief AI scientist at Lirio, told TechCrunch. “From an AI research perspective, this is nothing novel,” he told TechCrunch. The key thing is that it hit a new capability threshold by just organizing and combining these existing capabilities that already were thrown together in a way that enabled it to give you a very seamless way to get tasks done autonomously.” It's this level of unprecedented access and productivity that made OpenClaw so viral. “It basically just facilitates interaction between computer programs in a way that is just so much more dynamic and flexible, and that's what's allowing all these things to become possible,” Symons said. The problem is that AI agents may never be able to overcome the thing that makes them so powerful: they can't think critically like humans can. Ahl's security tests of OpenClaw and Moltbook help illustrate Sorokin's point. Ahl created an AI agent of his own named Rufio and quickly discovered it was vulnerable to prompt injection attacks. This occurs when bad actors get an AI agent to respond to something — perhaps a post on Moltbook, or a line in an email — that tricks it into doing something it shouldn't do, like giving out account credentials or credit card information. “It is just an agent sitting with a bunch of credentials on a box connected to everything — your email, your messaging platform, everything you use,” Ahl said. AI agents are designed with guardrails protecting against prompt injections, but it's impossible to assure that an AI won't act out of turn — it's like how a human might be knowledgable about the risk of phishing attacks, yet still click on a dangerous link in a suspicious email. “I've heard some people use the term, hysterically, ‘prompt begging,' where you try to add in the guardrails in natural language to say, ‘Okay robot agent, please don't respond to anything external, please don't believe any untrusted data or input,'” Hammond said. “Speaking frankly, I would realistically tell any normal layman, don't use it right now,” Hammond said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I spend a lot of my time testing and reviewing new laptops. But no matter how hard I try, there will always be people that go to Amazon.com and buy whatever cheap, crappy thing comes up for the “best laptop” search term. That's especially true now that these retailer pages are showing up in Google search results for the same query. In almost every case, you'll find laptops that have better alternatives at the same price, but Amazon won't show them—for whatever reason. I hope I'm not the first person to tell you that buying unknown products on Amazon is not a smart idea, but when it comes to your laptop, it's an especially bad idea. Your work, school, gaming, or creative ambitions will all be severely hampered by buying one of these machines. The egregious thing about these laptops isn't that they exist, but that Amazon ranks them higher than proper laptops—the kind people should actually buy. You'll never get the same results, but all the times I've tried searching (including in Incognito), I saw tons of ultra-cheap Windows laptops that cost under $300. You might look at these and wonder what could be wrong, especially since some of these sport seemingly solid specs like “Quad-Core” processors and 256 GB of storage. One of the most egregious examples that showed up on page one of Amazon's results was this HP laptop. Despite being a nearly four-year-old laptop with a typo in the title (who doesn't want an “Ultral” Light laptop? ), this is apparently an “Amazon's Choice” selection that comes highly recommended with four out of five stars. These kinds of laptops are propped up by ratings from years ago, when this laptop would have been slightly more relevant. It would have been a stretch in 2022, but today? I've tested plenty of these in my day to know that you'll feel it chug along with even the most basic tasks. Lastly, it comes with Windows 11 S Mode, a version of Windows that doesn't allow you to download applications from a web browser. Never buy a laptop with anything less than 1920 x 1080 resolution in 2026, no matter how cheap it is. Check out this 2025 Asus Chromebook CX15 instead, a laptop I tested last year. Despite being about the same price, it comes with a 1080p screen, as well as a proper 128-GB solid-state drive. If you really need Windows on the cheap, check out this Acer Aspire Go 15, which at least comes with a 1080p screen, a 256-GB SSD, and a proper version of Windows 11 Home. But there were two others that stuck out as simply bad deals. This Acer Nitro V gaming laptop showed up toward the bottom of the list and seemingly comes with decent specs. But the RTX 4050 graphics card included is just not fast enough to be worth $950 in 2026. It comes with less storage, but don't forget: you can always add on storage with an external SSD. You can't make your GPU faster without buying an entirely new laptop. You can get a Lenovo LOQ 15 with an RTX 5060 for $970. This is one of my favorite deals in gaming laptops right now, providing a huge upgrade in performance over the RTX 4050. Beyond the outdated Acer Nitro, I also spotted this Samsung Galaxy Book4. This is not a terrible laptop on its own, but at $565, there are better options. There's the Asus Vivobook 14 (or 16), which costs $650 and occasionally dips down to $550. If you want great deals on laptops that are actually worth buying, check out our Best Budget Laptops, Best Budget Gaming Laptops, and Best Chromebooks recommendations, which I frequently update. Oh, you've never heard of the well-known, reliable laptop manufacturer Jumper? Like the HP laptops above, these are extremely cheap Windows 11 laptops—all under $300. The large touchpad and edge-to-edge keyboard look nice, too. Marketing these as gaming laptops is very misleading, as they don't come with a discrete graphics card—or any other notable gaming features. You can't actually buy a worthwhile gaming laptop for this much, and these off-brand companies are preying on that fact. There are a couple of laptops that appeared on page one of the Amazon results that were promising. Amazon put the 13-inch M4 Apple MacBook Air high up, which is also our top pick for the best laptop you can buy. Amazon also recommended the Dell 15 Laptop, which is a budget device that looks solid. I haven't tested it yet myself, but it's a 2025 laptop for $530 that comes with decent specs, such as a 120-Hz refresh rate, 16 GB of RAM, and 512 GB of storage. Walmart, which has become another popular online laptop retailer, does an even worse job, appealing to the lowest common denominator. It falls into the same traps as Amazon, surfacing ultra-cheap, outdated HP laptops under $300, and tons of unknown knock-off brands like "RNRUO" and “Coolby." This problem is even worse at Walmart; 24 out of the 40 laptops offered on page one are from these mystery brands, and most of the rest are from HP. It's really a shame, as Walmart and Amazon both have great deals on some of my favorite laptops, but they're often buried unless you're specifically searching or filtering for them. Maybe none of this is surprising to you. For me, I was surprised by just how dire the situation has become. As prices rise in 2026 due to grim economic realities and the ongoing memory shortage, cheap laptops will grow in importance, and retailers like Amazon need to do a better job of directing people toward devices that are actually worth buying.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As India's first AI company to IPO, Fractal Analytics didn't have a stellar first day on the public markets, as enthusiasm for the technology collided with jittery investors recovering from a major sell-off in Indian software stocks. Fractal listed at ₹876 per share on Monday, below its issue price of ₹900, and then slid further in afternoon trading. That price tag marks a step down from Fractal's recent private-market highs. Fractal's IPO comes as India seeks to position itself as a key market and development hub for AI in a bid to attract investment amid increasing attention from some of the world's most prominent AI companies. That push is on display this week in New Delhi, where India is hosting the AI Impact Summit, bringing together global technology leaders, policymakers and executives. The company pivoted toward AI in 2022 after operating as a traditional data analytics firm for over 20 years. Fractal touted a steadily growing business in its IPO filing, with revenue from operations rising 26% to ₹27.65 billion (around $304.8 million) in the year ended March 2025 compared to a year earlier. The company plans to use the IPO proceeds to repay borrowings at its U.S. subsidiary, invest in R&D, sales and marketing under its Fractal Alpha unit, expand office infrastructure in India, and pursue potential acquisitions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A shocking but ultimately brief airspace closure over El Paso, Texas, and parts of New Mexico last week is stoking unease among pilots and the broader public about the status of United States anti-drone defenses. As low-cost UAV equipment proliferates around the world, analysts have repeatedly warned that destructive attacks perpetrated using drones are inevitable. It is challenging to develop nimble and safe countermeasures, though, given that things like jamming or attempting to shoot down a drone are difficult—or even impossible—to carry out safely in populated areas, much less densely populated cities. The Trump administration initially said the move was related to possible incursion of Mexican drug cartel drones, but the New York Times and others reported that it came from FAA concerns that Customs and Border Protection officials were using a Pentagon-provided anti-drone laser weapon in the area despite questions about potential dangers to civilian aircraft. “The Department of War and the Department of Transportation having been working together for months regarding drone incursion operations. Also on Thursday, US representatives Veronica Escobar of Texas and Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico, along with New Mexico senators Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján, wrote to DHS secretary Kristi Noem, defense secretary Pete Hegseth, and transportation secretary Sean Duffy to request a classified briefing on the incident. The LOCUST system is a 20-kilowatt laser directed energy weapon, a relatively low-power tool made to be used to take out small drones. “The recent proliferation of inexpensive and readily available drones has shifted the focus to short-range air defense, where lasers and high-powered microwaves offer a potentially game-changing advantage,” an Army report on a laser weapons test said in June. AV delivered two sets of LOCUST units to the US Army in September and December as part of the Army Multi-Purpose High Energy Laser (AMP-HEL) prototyping project—one of a few “Directed Energy Efforts” that the Army's Directed Energy Prototyping Office undertook in 2025. Deployment of anti-drone defense measures is becoming a bigger priority in the US and around the world, but integrating them safely is challenging and experts say there need to be new protocols and communication mechanisms in place to protect both civilian and military aviation. Even the most seemingly innocuous laser pointers or other laser-equipped tools, for example, can pose risks to pilots and aviation. As one put it, “I do not want to be stuck anywhere for 10 days or get hit by a laser.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In April 2024, a mysterious someone using the online handles “Waifu” and “Judische” began posting death threats on Telegram and Discord channels aimed at a cybersecurity researcher named Allison Nixon. “Decerebration is my fav type of brain death, thats whats gonna happen to alison Nixon.” These anonymous personas targeted Nixon because she had become a formidable threat: As chief research officer at the cyber investigations firm Unit 221B, named after Sherlock Holmes's apartment, she had built a career tracking cybercriminals and helping get them arrested. For years she had lurked quietly in online chat channels or used pseudonyms to engage with perpetrators directly while piecing together clues they'd carelessly drop about themselves and their crimes. But members of the Com aren't just involved in hacking; some of them also engage in offline violence against researchers who track them. Nixon started tracking members of the community more than a decade ago, when other researchers and people in law enforcement were largely ignoring them because they were young—many in their teens. Ryan Brogan, a special agent with the FBI, says Nixon has helped him and colleagues identify and arrest more than two dozen members of the community since 2011, when he first began working with her, and that her skills in exposing them are unparalleled. Though she'd done this work for more than a decade, Nixon couldn't understand why the person behind the Waifu/Judische accounts was suddenly threatening her. And although she had taken an interest in the Waifu persona in years past for crimes he boasted about committing, he hadn't been on her radar for a while when the threats began, because she was tracking other targets. Most people have never heard of the Com, but its influence and threat are growing. Over the last decade, its criminal activities have escalated from simple distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that disrupt websites to SIM-swapping hacks that hijack a victim's phone service, as well as crypto theft, ransomware attacks, and corporate data theft. These crimes have affected AT&T, Microsoft, Uber, and others. Com members have also been involved in various forms of sextortion aimed at forcing victims to physically harm themselves or record themselves doing sexually explicit activities. One longtime cybercrime researcher, who asked to remain anonymous because of his work, says the Com is as big a threat in the cyber realm as Russia and China—for one unusual reason. “There's only so far that China is willing to go; there's only so far that Russia or North Korea is willing to go,” he says, referring to international laws and norms, and fears of retaliation, that prevent states from going all out in cyber operations. That doesn't stop the anarchic Com, he says. There is no single site where Com members congregate; they spread across a number of web forums and Telegram and Discord channels. The group follows a long line of hacking and subculture communities that emerged online over the last two decades, gained notoriety, and then faded or vanished after prominent members were arrested or other factors caused their decline. They differed in motivation and activity, but all emerged from “the same primordial soup,” says Nixon. The Com's roots can be traced to the Scene, which began as a community of various “warez” groups engaged in pirating computer games, music, and movies. When Nixon began looking at the Scene, in 2011, its members were hijacking gaming accounts, launching DDoS attacks, and running booter services. (DDoS attacks overwhelm a server or computer with traffic from bot-controlled machines, preventing legitimate traffic from getting through; booters are tools that anyone can rent to launch a DDoS attack against a target of choice.) While they made some money, their primary goal was notoriety. The pandemic two years later saw a surge in Com membership that Nixon attributes to social isolation and the forced movement of kids online for schooling. But she believes economic conditions and socialization problems have also driven its growth. Many Com members can't get jobs because they lack skills or have behavioral issues, she says. The Com provides camaraderie, support, and an outlet for personal frustrations. Since 2018, it has also offered some a solution to their money problems. Loose-knit cells have sprouted from the community—Star Fraud, ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider, Lapsus$—to collaborate on clusters of crime. But dominance, power, and bragging rights are still motivators, even in profit operations, says the cybercrime researcher, which is partly why members target “big whales.” “There is financial gain,” he says, “but it's also [sending a message that] I can reach out and touch the people that think they're untouchable.” In fact, Nixon says, some members of the Com have overwhelming ego-driven motivations that end up conflicting with their financial motives. “Often their financial schemes fall apart because of their ego, and that phenomenon is also what I've made my career on,” she says. Nixon has straight dark hair, wears wire-rimmed glasses, and has a slight build and bookish demeanor that, on first impression, could allow her to pass for a teen herself. She talks about her work in rapid cadences, like someone whose brain is filled with facts that are under pressure to get out, and she exudes a sense of urgency as she tries to make people understand the threat the Com poses. The center responded to tickets and security alerts emanating from customer networks, but Nixon coveted a position on the company's counter-threats team, which investigated and published threat-intelligence reports on mostly state-sponsored hacking groups from China and Russia. Without connections or experience, she had no path to investigative work. But Nixon is an intensely curious person, and this created its own path. She was surprised to see members openly discussing their crimes there. She reached out to someone on the SecureWorks threat team to see if he was aware of the site, and he dismissed it as a place for “script kiddies”—a pejorative term for unskilled hackers. This was a time when many cybersecurity pros were shifting their focus away from cybercrime to state-sponsored hacking operations, which were more sophisticated and getting a lot of attention. They focused on trying to identify the people running DDoS booters. What Nixon loved about the forums was how accessible they were to a beginner like herself. But Nixon could access everything she needed in the public forums, where the hackers seemed to think no one was watching. I realize that this is a very uncommon thing. And maybe my brain is built a little weird that I'm willing to do this,” she says. Nixon soon realized that not all the members were script kiddies. Some exhibited real ingenuity and “powerful” skills, she says, but because they were applying these to frivolous purposes—hijacking gamer accounts instead of draining bank accounts—researchers and law enforcement were ignoring them. Nixon began tracking them, suspecting that they would eventually direct their skills at more significant targets—an intuition that proved to be correct. And when they did, she had already amassed a wealth of information about them. She continued her DDoS research for two years until a turning point in 2013, when the cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs, who made a career tracking cybercriminals, got swatted. About a dozen people from the security community worked with Krebs to expose the perpetrator, and Nixon was invited to help. “It was an amazing moment for me,” she says. “I was like, wow, there's all these like-minded people that just want to help and are doing it just for the love of the game, basically.” It was porn stars who provided Nixon with her next big research focus—one that underscored her skill at spotting Com actors and criminal trends in their nascent stages, before they emerged as major threats. In 2018, someone was hijacking the social media accounts of certain adult-film stars and using those accounts to blast out crypto scams to their large follower bases. These messages led her to a forum where members were talking about how they stole the accounts. Then they used a technique called SIM swapping to reset passwords for social media accounts belonging to those other stars, locking them out. In SIM swapping, fraudsters get a victim's phone number assigned to a SIM card and phone they control, so that calls and messages intended for the victim go to them instead. This includes one-time security codes that sites text to account holders to verify themselves when accessing their account or changing its password. SIM swapping is a powerful technique that can be used to hijack and drain entire cryptocurrency and bank accounts, so Nixon was surprised to see the fraudsters using it for relatively unprofitable schemes. Nixon suspected that this would change and SIM swapping would soon become a major problem, so she shifted her research focus accordingly. It didn't take long for the fraudsters to pivot as well. On multiple occasions a hacker or hacking group would catch her attention—for using a novel hacking approach in some minor operation, for example—and she'd begin tracking their online posts and chats in the belief that they'd eventually do something significant with that skill. But Nixon would already have a dossier compiled on them and, in some cases, had unmasked their real identity as well. So the FBI sought their assistance in identifying them. “The thing about these young hackers is that they … keep going until they get arrested, but it takes years for them to get arrested,” she says. “So a huge aspect of my career is just sitting on this information that has not been actioned [yet].” It was during the Lizard Squad years that Nixon began developing tools to scrape and record hacker communications online, though it would be years before she began using these concepts to scrape the Com chatrooms and forums. These channels held a wealth of data that might not seem useful during the nascent stage of a hacker's career but could prove critical later, when law enforcement got around to investigating them; yet the contents were always at risk of being deleted by Com members or getting taken down by law enforcement when it seized websites and chat channels. Nixon's work is unique because she engages with the actors in chat spaces to draw out information from them that “would not be otherwise normally available.” She pulled all of this data together into a searchable platform that other researchers and law enforcement could use. The company hired two former hackers to help build scraping tools and infrastructure for this work; the result is eWitness, a community-driven, invitation-­only platform. It was initially seeded only with data Nixon had collected after she arrived at Unit 221B, but has since been augmented with data that other users of the platform have scraped from Com social spaces as well, some of which doesn't exist in public forums anymore. Brogan, of the FBI, says it's an incredibly valuable tool, made more so by Nixon's own contributions. Other security firms scrape online criminal spaces as well, but they seldom share the content with outsiders, and Brogan says Nixon's work is unique because she engages with the actors in chat spaces to draw out information from them that “would not be otherwise normally available.” She was able to capture their chats as these groups first emerged; after law enforcement arrested leaders of the groups and took control of the servers where their chats were posted, this material went offline. CVLT—pronounced “cult”—was reportedly founded around 2019 with a focus on sextortion and child sexual abuse material. 764 emerged from CVLT and was spearheaded by a 15-year-old in Texas named Bradley Cadenhead, who named it after the first digits of his zip code. The type of sextortion they engaged in has its roots in activity that began a decade ago as “fan signing.” Hackers would use the threat of doxxing to coerce someone, usually a young female, into writing the hacker's handle on a piece of paper. Eventually some began blackmailing victims into writing the hacker's handle on their face, breasts, or genitals. With CVLT, this escalated even further; targets were blackmailed into carving a Com member's name into their skin or engaging in sexually explicit acts while recording or livestreaming themselves. During the pandemic a surprising number of SIM swappers crossed into child sexual abuse material and sadistic sextortion, according to Nixon. She had long been frustrated at how leniently judges treated financial fraudsters because of their crimes' seemingly nonviolent nature. At this point, Waifu still wasn't on her radar. Waifu's group gained access to dozens of cloud accounts with Snowflake, a company that provides online data storage for customers. “It's like they were begging to be investigated,” says Nixon. Nixon and other researchers believe the hackers may have been able to identify the phone numbers of agents through other means. Then they may have used a reverse-lookup program to identify the owners of phone numbers that the agents called or that called them and found Nixon's number among them. “It's like they were begging to be investigated,” says Nixon. So she was perplexed when he started taunting and threatening her online. Over several weeks in May and June, a pattern developed. Waifu or one of his associates would post a threat against her and then post a message online inviting her to talk. She assumes now that they believed she was helping law enforcement investigate the Snowflake breaches and hoped to draw her into a dialogue to extract information from her about what authorities knew. But Nixon wasn't helping the FBI investigate them yet. It was only after she began looking at Waifu for the threats that she became aware of his suspected role in the Snowflake hack. It wasn't the first time she had studied him, though. Waifu had come to her attention in 2019 when he bragged about framing another Com member for a hoax bomb threat and later talked about his involvement in SIM-swapping operations. He bragged about not needing sleep and using Adderall to hack through the night. He was also a bit reckless about protecting personal details. Some of the best leads came from a target's enemies; she could glean a lot of information about their identity, personality, and activities from what the people they fought with online said about them. While she was doing this, Waifu and his group were reaching out to other security researchers, trying to glean information about Nixon and what she might be investigating. They also attempted to plant false clues with the researchers by dropping the names of other cybercriminals in Canada who could plausibly be Waifu. Nixon had never seen cybercriminals engage in counterintelligence tactics like this. Amid this subterfuge and confusion, Nixon and another researcher working with her did a lot of consulting and cross-checking with other researchers about the clues they were gathering to ensure they had the right name before they gave it to the FBI. By July she and the researcher were convinced they had their guy: Connor Riley Moucka, a 25-year-old high school dropout living with his grandfather in Ontario. According to an affidavit filed in Canadian court, a plainclothes Canadian police officer visited Moucka's house under some pretense on the afternoon of October 21, nine days before the arrest, to secretly capture a photo of him and compare it with an image US authorities had provided. She believes the visit to his door spooked him. Nixon won't say exactly how they unmasked Moucka—only that he made a mistake. The Canadian affidavit against Moucka reveals a number of other violent posts he's alleged to have made online beyond the threats he made against her. Some involve musings about becoming a serial killer or mass-mailing sodium nitrate pills to Black people in Michigan and Ohio; in another, his online persona talks about obtaining firearms to “kill Canadians” and commit “suicide by cop.” Prosecutors, who list Moucka's online aliases as including Waifu, Judische, and two more in the indictment, say he and others extorted at least $2.5 million from at least three victims whose data they stole from Snowflake accounts. Moucka has been charged with nearly two dozen counts, including conspiracy, unauthorized access to computers, extortion, and wire fraud. He has pleaded not guilty and was extradited to the US last July. His trial is scheduled for October this year, though hacking cases usually end in plea agreements rather than going to trial. It took months for authorities to arrest Moucka after Nixon and her colleague shared their findings with the authorities, but an alleged associate of his in the Snowflake conspiracy, a US Army soldier named Cameron John Wagenius (Kiberphant0m online), was arrested more quickly. On November 10, 2024, Nixon and her team found a mistake Wagenius made that helped identify him, and on December 20 he was arrested. Wagenius has already pleaded guilty to two charges around the sale or attempted sale of confidential phone records and will be sentenced this March. These days Nixon continues to investigate sextortion among Com members. But she says that remaining members of Waifu's group still taunt and threaten her.

Europe kind of sort of has all the same competences of the US in this area (tanks, APCs, AA missiles, SA missiles, aerospace, radars to name a few) but lacks the scale of production, there's clear scope for collaboration.

This will also create new jobs and a market which the economy probably needs.

The only realistic threat to Canada is the new one from Donald Trump, but it would take closer to 30% GDP to protect from that one.

Canada is pretty big: it's the second-largest country by land-area. Surely there must be certain defense expenditures that need to scale with that?> In actuality, Canada spends more than twice as much per capita than the world average.That seems like a twisted measure, due to 1) the land-area issue I mentioned above, and 2) there are a lot of countries in the world that are small and poor, and thus cannot afford a military that can actually defend themselves.> The only realistic threat to Canada is the new one from Donald Trump...That's actually not a realistic threat, either.
