                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The NFT craze of 2021 led to massive purchases, celebrity endorsements, and skyrocketing valuations, but now the bubble has burst. Logan Paul and Justin Bieber are among the celebrities who have seen their NFT investments plummet in value by over 95%. The total NFT market cap has dropped significantly, leading to the closure of major platforms and rendering roughly 95% of NFTs worthless. Remember when everyone and their cousin was buying NFTs? When a pixelated ape was worth more than a house, and celebrities were flexing digital receipts like they'd cracked some kind of financial cheat code? YouTuber Logan Paul purchased an NFT from the 0N1 Force collection — a series of anime-style digital avatar artworks — for $635,000 in 2021. That same NFT is now valued at roughly $155, reflecting a loss of more than 99%. The valuation comparison recently circulated via the verified X account of Watcher.Guru and has since spread widely across cryptocurrency communities. Paul himself acknowledged the L years ago. In a 2022 post on X, he wrote that the NFT he'd spent $623,000 on was “worth essentially nothing,” calling it an immortalized mistake. Pop star Justin Bieber purchased a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT for $1.3 million in January 2022 that has since dropped to around $12,000 by February 2026 — a decline of over 95%. More than 2.5 million crypto wallets were holding or trading NFTs, up from just 89,000 the year before. Beeple sold a single digital artwork for $69 million at Christie's. Paul alone spent over $2.5 million on 139 NFTs from 16 collections in 2021. Scarcity narratives and online hype did the rest. Nifty Gateway, one of the earliest NFT marketplaces that facilitated over $300 million in sales at its peak, shut down on February 23, 2026. Christie's quietly closed its digital art department last fall, and Sotheby's laid off most of its NFT team in 2024. Nike also quietly offloaded its NFT subsidiary RTFKT, which it had acquired during the boom. Analysis suggests roughly 95% of NFTs are now worthless. The broader crypto market isn't having a great time either. After reaching an all-time high of approximately $126,198 in October 2025, Bitcoin has faced a sharp retracement. As of February 16, 2026, Bitcoin is trading around $68,605 — down more than 45% from that peak. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has been hovering near “extreme fear” levels not seen since the 2022 FTX collapse. U.S. exchange-traded funds, which purchased 46,000 bitcoin at this point last year, have become net sellers in 2026. Some analysts are calling it a standard four-year cycle correction.</p>

The amount of people trading perps is still a very small fraction. Perpetual is not a product that's really allowed in the US.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin and crypto markets have entered a new phase defined less by speculation and more by portfolio discipline, according to a new note from WisdomTree. Dovile Silenskyte, director of digital assets research at WisdomTree, wrote in a note shared with Decrypt that the days of survival and price discovery are behind crypto traders. "Crypto has moved on from its retail-led, boom-bust adolescence. Silenskyte added that crypto investors need to understand that the nature of the market has changed, particularly because traditional diversification is under strain as inflation risk lingers, fiscal dominance is persistent, and equity-bond correlations have become unreliable. The New York-based asset manager, founded in 2006, is best known for its exchange-traded products. That catalog of funds now includes institutional-grade exposure to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and broader crypto baskets. In Europe, the firm has a broader offering that includes funds tied to Solana, Cardano, Polkadot, and XRP. That's been helped along, in part, by regulation. "Regulation is acting as a filter, not a kill switch, concentrating capital into assets and structures that meet governance, custody and transparency standards," she wrote. The coin is now 1.6% lower than it was this time last week, according to crypto price aggregator CoinGecko.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Harvard Cuts Bitcoin ETF Stake, Adds Ethereum Exposure in Q4 Filing By November, it had tripled those holdings to roughly $350 million in market value at the time. Harvard's latest adjustments to its crypto ETF holdings come amid choppy conditions from late 2025, when spot Bitcoin ETFs saw bouts of net outflows continuing through January and February this year. Industry observers are divided over whether the reallocation reflects relative value positioning, diversification, or institutional constraints shaping Harvard's digital asset strategy. Harvard is likely “making a relative value trade with the belief that ETH is undervalued relative to BTC,” Sean Bill, co-founder and chief investment officer at Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company, told Decrypt, adding that the endowment may have “a limit on the initial exposure that it can maintain in digital assets” and could have reduced its Bitcoin stake “to make room for a short-term trade in ETH.” “Harvard's decision to trim its Bitcoin ETF exposure while initiating a position in an Ethereum ETF likely reflects a more differentiated view of opportunity across digital assets,” Jennifer Ouarrag, Head of Legal at institutional staking provider Twinstake, told Decrypt. The other is programmable infrastructure,” Nima Beni, founder of Bitlease, told Decrypt. “Both belong in institutional portfolios, but treating them as substitutes risks misunderstanding their structural differences.” Harvard's trade “likely reflects regulatory clarity and ETF accessibility, optimizing for near-term compliance comfort rather than long-term structural positioning,” Beni added. Some have described the move as a “textbook allocator move,” with Iva Wisher, founder of Bitcoin-native execution environment Midl, arguing that it reflects a move away from “single-asset crypto exposure” rather than a loss of faith in Bitcoin. The trim “doesn't mean they prefer one over the other, they're a long-term investor and it's more of a nuanced view of risk and opportunity,” Abdul Rafay Gadit, co-founder of Zigchain, told Decrypt. “The more meaningful signal isn't the precise ETF weighting in a single quarter, but whether institutions are incrementally expanding their comfort with on-chain infrastructure over time.” The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

Barry Silbert, CEO of cryptocurrency conglomerate Digital Currency Group, said Wednesday that privacy-focused cryptocurrencies are poised to become the next big investment opportunity in the industry. During a conversation with Anthony Pompliano at the Bitcoin Investor Week conference, Silbert said his thesis is that 5-10% of Bitcoin's (CRYPTO: BTC) market cap would rotate into privacy coins, including Zcash (CRYPTO: ZEC). Professional traders demand transparency — see why Kraken Pro has become one of crypto's most trusted advanced trading platforms. The AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share “Bitcoin, for all its amazing attributes, is likely never going to have any privacy features,” he argued. That doesn't mean Silbert is bearish on Bitcoin's long-term potential. Privacy-focused cryptocurrencies outperformed market heavyweights, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), last year. That said, these coins have failed to shield themselves from this year's early crypto slump.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bloomberg Intelligence macro strategist Mike McGlone said Monday that collapsing crypto prices may signal broader financial stress, warning bitcoin could revert toward $10,000 and potentially foreshadow the next U.S. recession. In a post on X, McGlone also said the long-standing “buy the dip” mentality that has supported risk assets since 2008 could be breaking down as digital assets weaken and volatility dynamics shift. “Healthy Correction is what we should hear soon from stock market analysts (who risk unemployment if not onboard), following collapsing cryptos,” McGlone wrote. McGlone pointed to several macro indicators that reflect elevated risk conditions. U.S. stock market capitalization relative to gross domestic product (GDP) has reached its highest level in roughly a century, he noted. He also described the “crypto bubble” as “imploding,” adding that “Trump euphoria” has peaked and is contributing to contagion across markets. Meanwhile, gold and silver are “grabbing alpha” at a pace last seen about half a century ago, with rising volatility that he said could “trickle up” into equities. McGlone shared a chart comparing bitcoin divided by 10 for scaling, with the S&P 500. Beyond that, part of his base case calls for bitcoin to revert toward $10,000, contingent on a peak in the U.S. stock market. Jason Fernandes, co-founder of AdLunam and a market analyst, told CoinDesk that McGlone's thesis assumes market extremes must resolve through collapse and that bitcoin's equity beta guarantees a proportional crash. “Markets can also resolve excess through time, rotation, or inflation erosion. “That implies recession plus financial stress, not just slower growth,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former teen pop icon Justin Bieber has taken a massive hit in one of his NFTs over the last few years. In 2022, he purchased one of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) digital collectibles for 500 ETH (worth $1.2 million) in a much-publicized transaction. However, his NFT is now worth just a fraction of what he paid for it, down 99.99%. However, NFTs have since faded into the background, and tens of billions of dollars spent on them have been wiped out by market forces. The total market capitalization of NFTs is just around $1.55 billion as of early 2026, with only a few blue-chip collections retaining some value, if at all. The value of NFTs varied significantly based on appearance, style, color schemes, and even prior ownership. Bieber didn't give an official reason behind the purchase, but it was reported that this particular piece had physical similarities to the pop icon. The only silver lining for Bieber in this situation is that his ownership of #3001 might make the collectible more valuable than its reported $12,000 price tag, given his association with it. Other popular digital collectibles like Pudgy Penguins and Cryptopunks have also incurred heavy losses since 2022, and the overall sector is stuck in a permanent decline for now, unlike Bitcoin, which has seen ups and downs over the last two years. Last October, Yuga Labs announced plans to open a physical Bored Ape clubhouse in Miami, Florida, an exclusive hangout for its NFT holders. The whole promise of these digital collections was exclusivity, and that's the model they want to continue with right now.</p>

The crypto market remains under pressure on Monday despite U.S. equity futures rising by around 0.25% since midnight UTC.

Bitcoin BTC$68,770.50 trades at $68,710, having lost 0.1%. Altcoins such as HYPE, ZEC and XMR are down by more than 3%.

Ether ETH$1,978.09 is one of Monday's outliers, rising by 0.43% since midnight as it claws its way back to $2,000 after a grueling weekend selloff was spurred by selling pressure from trader Garrett Jin.

Onchain data shows a wallet attributed to Jin deposited more than $540 million worth of ether to Binance over the weekend, leading to a disproportionate rise in sell volume compared with other exchanges.

That pressure translated into oversold conditions that ultimately set the scene for Monday's recovery.

Gold is changing hands at $5,000 on Monday, down from its Jan. 29 peak of $5,600 but outperforming silver and crypto, which are down by 36% and 21% respectively over the same period.

U.S. markets are closed on Monday due to a public holiday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If we cast our minds back to 2022, you'd be familiar with the word 'NFT' being thrown around online and popularised by some of the world's biggest stars. Each NFT has a different level of value and popularity. Ownership is tracked through the blockchain, a system that records information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. Each NFT has a different level of value and popularity. NFTs became some sort of dystopian status symbol following the pandemic – especially Bored Ape ones, which were purchased by the likes of Paris Hilton, Eminem, Jimmy Fallon, and Serena Williams. Moreover, Logan Paul purchased a rare Bumblebee 0N1 Force NFT for $623,000 in 2021. Five years later, it's said to be valued at $155. "I'm just shocked it is worth $155, and not more like $1.55, if that," one person quipped. It's worth noting that the value of NFTs fluctuates. It didn't take long for netizens to chime in on the action, with many highlighting how their "NFTs are pointless" theories have come to fruition. Another reiterated: "NFTs are worthless, it's pictures backed by nothing." A third penned: "My wallet is full of NFTs, and they've mostly gone to zero! Is there any way I can get my money back?" In 2022, he described the NFT craze as being "100 per cent based on greater fool theory," the idea that someone can make money by purchasing overvalued assets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite falling crypto prices, more merchants are accepting digital assets, with stablecoins and not volatile tokens driving real payment activity. Stablecoins are working through cards, not replacing them, being embedded into network infrastructure as a funding layer. Crypto markets are slumping just as institutional interest in blockchain is growing. But as Presidents Day promotions roll out across the U.S., crypto holders who still have some liquidity left in their digital wallets to spend may paradoxically find more retailers than ever ready to accept their tokens. Except, in most cases today, it isn't typical crypto tokens like bitcoin or Dogecoin that consumers are shopping with. Rather than replacing cards, stablecoins are being absorbed into card infrastructure as a new settlement and funding source, allowing merchants to accept digital assets without ever holding them, as card networks and their partners do the heavy lifting in the background. Monthly payment flows via such cards now exceed $1.5 billion, underscoring meaningful consumer usage, and overall crypto-linked card spending has reached roughly $18 billion annualized, signaling a potential migration from more speculative use cases to pure-play retail payments. And while those numbers represent a modest amount when compared to global card spend, the mechanics of the emerging crypto-linked card marketplace show that incumbent networks are going on offense, not playing defense. Today, consumers can use digital assets to book travel, purchase consumer electronics, pay for cloud services, acquire luxury goods, and even settle recurring bills through intermediaries that convert crypto into local currency at the point of sale. We'd love to be your preferred source for news. The most consequential shift, however, may not involve consumers consciously choosing to “pay with crypto” at all, but may come from stablecoin cards that allow users to hold value outside banks while spending within the card ecosystem. The competition around these products is less about retail payments themselves and more about which institutions will control the monetary layer beneath them, as they, in effect, represent a structural decoupling of deposit capture from payment activity. The competitive landscape here can be understood as a three-sided race: Because stablecoins track sovereign currencies, primarily the U.S. dollar, they can function as transactional balances rather than speculative holdings. That stability allows card issuers, FinTech platforms and exchanges to treat them as stored value accounts that fund conventional card transactions. The earliest large-scale use cases for stablecoin-linked cards are appearing in regions where cross-border payments, currency volatility or limited banking access create friction. In such environments, holding dollar-denominated digital value while spending locally offers tangible advantages. Faster settlement and reduced foreign exchange complexity can outweigh concerns about novelty. If tokenized dollars can be converted seamlessly at authorization, the network still earns fees, maintains routing authority and preserves its role as the intermediary trusted by both issuers and merchants. At the end of the day, stablecoin-linked cards may prove to be less of a disruption than a translation mechanism between two monetary systems. Whether they ultimately reshape banking, payments, or digital commerce will depend not on consumer behavior, which has barely changed, but on which institutions succeed in controlling the infrastructure that now connects them. We're always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To own Trump Media & Technology Group today, you have to believe the company can turn a small, loss-making media platform into a broader digital ecosystem spanning streaming, fintech, and now crypto-linked products. The pending merger with TAE Technologies, the Truth+ rollout, and “America First” ETFs were already the main near term catalysts, while persistent losses, minimal revenue, governance concerns, and a share price that has fallen about two thirds over the past year remained front and center as risks. The new Truth Social crypto ETF filings with Crypto.com add another potential catalyst, but also another regulatory and execution swing factor, rather than a clear fix for the core problem of limited revenue scale. Given the stock's volatility and recent declines, this latest move may not be a material near term driver without visible uptake or SEC progress.
