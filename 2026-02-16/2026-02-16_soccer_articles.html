                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. men's national team manager Mauricio Pochettino will name his squad for March's friendlies against Belgium and Portugal in the coming weeks—a camp he's indicated will be the final chance for players to stake their claim for a place on the 2026 World Cup roster. It's allowed Americans abroad to continue finding their form ahead of this summer's showpiece event—even Christian Pulisic was back in action this past weekend for AC Milan after recovering from injury. German-American dual-national center back Noahkai Banks is an outside bet to make the USMNT's World Cup roster—but the 19-year-old is sure giving it a good go. Making his 16th consecutive start for FC Augsburg, Banks put in a composed display as his side saw off FC Heidenheim 1–0, registering a fourth Bundesliga clean sheet of the season. He completed 37 of 39 passes, delivered three passes into the final third and amassed nine clearances, four of which came aerially. More impressively, Banks played with a maturity beyond his tender years—an improvement in his game that can perhaps be attributed to past conversations he's had with Pochettino, who was a central defender in his playing days. As Weston McKennie made his way back to Turin after a chaotic 3–2 Juventus loss to Inter Milan on Saturday, there's a good chance he was imagining what the season would have looked like had Luciano Spalletti started the season in charge. McKennie controlled the midfield against the Serie A leaders, assisting on both of his side's goals to take his total to four since Thanksgiving—in that time, McKennie has also bagged seven goals. The 27-year-old also had two shots on target of his own and slotted five passes into the final third, all while playing an active role as a deep-lying forward, A series of controversial calls, most notably the red card issued to Pierre Kalulu, contributed to Juventus' eventual defeat, but there's no doubt that McKennie, who is out of contract in the summer, did his chances of earning a new, improved deal no harm at all. While the 25-year-old has showcased his scoring touch all season since joining Charlotte FC in the summer, it is clear he has developed as well. When in MLS, many of his best chances came from his long strides on balls played low through the middle—rarely, if ever, was he an aerial threat, even though he stands 6'3" tall and is well built. Since arriving in England, there's been a clear improvement. This weekend, he rose highest to score from a corner kick, marking the sixth time he has scored with his head this season—60% of his overall tally.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>England and Scotland's 2026 FIFA World Cup group matches could face uncertainty due to an ongoing dispute involving Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts. Gillette Stadium, home of the New England Patriots and temporarily branded as “Boston Stadium” for the World Cup, is set to host seven matches. Town leaders have argued they cannot advance those costs without financial guarantees. Without clarity on funding arrangements, the license remains pending. Reports indicate that town officials have set a mid-March deadline for resolving the issue before making a final decision on the license. FIFA, local organizers and stadium representatives have said discussions are ongoing in an effort to secure a resolution. Federal funding designated for host cities may assist with security costs, but details regarding distribution remain uncertain. ‘Ridiculous': Ian Wright blasts Emiliano Martinez-inspired penalty rule change Who are England's record goalscorers as Harry Kane bids to become No 1 Leeds eye World Cup breakout star Tajon Buchanan despite £30m price-tag</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp turned down approaches from Manchester United and Chelsea after leaving Anfield, according to his agent and trusted advisor Marc Kosicke. The German coach opted to take a break from football following his departure from the Reds but has already been lured back into work as the Head of Global Soccer for Red Bull. Klopp achieved great success during his time at Liverpool, winning the Champions League in 2019 and then leading Liverpool to their first league title in 30 years in 2019-20. The German coach also won the FA Cup, League Cup and Club World Cup during his time with the Reds before shocking fans all over the world by announcing his departure in 2024. Klopp explained why he was leaving in an emotional statement, saying: "I told the club already in November. I can understand that it's a shock for a lot of people in this moment, when you hear it for the first time, but obviously I can explain it - or at least try to explain it. Kosicke has now revealed how clubs have been trying to tempt Klopp back into management, claiming he's already turned down approaches from two of Liverpool's Premier League rivals: He told Transfermarkt: "Even Chelsea and Manchester United enquired, although Jürgen had clearly stated that he would not coach any other club in England. And it's still wonderful to go down in history as one of the few coaches who only managed three clubs and were never fired. Before joining Red Bull, Jürgen could have coached the USA or England. Probably also Germany, if Julian Nagelsmann hadn't already been there." Klopp has spoken about how he's been enjoying life away from the dugout and hasn't missed football management since taking over at Red Bull. He was asked in September by The Athletic if he intends to expects his absence from the touchline to continue and answered: "That's what I think. If I started again at 65, everybody will say, ‘You said you'll never do it again!' That is what I think now. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Klopp may be out of the management game for now but his name continues to crop up whenever managerial vacancies arise. He has already been linked with a sensational return to Anfield this season amid uncertainty over Arne Slot's position at Liverpool. The Dutchman's side have put up a dismal defence of their Premier League trophy, despite a summer of heavy investment, and currently sit in sixth place in the table.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Christian Pulisic took advantage of the 2026 Winter Olympics taking place in his home city, as the AC Milan star was in attendance for the USA's 5-1 win over Germany in men's hockey on Sunday, Feb. 15. Pulisic was in the stands at Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena as the USA earned a bye into Wednesday's quarterfinals with a dominant win. The U.S. men's national team forward returned from a brief injury lay-off on Friday, Feb. 13, coming off the bench as Milan defeated Pisa 2-1 to maintain its Serie A title challenge. The USMNT star estimated he'd been to "less than 10, 15" hockey games in his life, most of which were the minor league Hershey Bears in his Pennsylvania hometown. "Just seeing some of these guys doing what they're doing, competing at the highest level in their sport, supporting team USA, it definitely gives me that extra drive and gets me excited for the summer," he said. Pulisic also spoke about the difference between playing in high-pressure competitions for AC Milan and the USMNT. "There's always pressure in some of the biggest competitions, whether club or country. But I think when you play for your country, you always have that little extra sense of pride representing team USA," he said. "It's the best thing you can do. So it's similar, but definitely something special when you play for your country."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And in Italy, Weston McKennie shone above the San Siro drama on Sunday — and Christian Pulisic made a welcome return to action. As the World Cup finals in the United States, Mexico and Canada edge ever closer, welcome to this week's USMNT player tracker. Agyemang took his 10th goal of the Championship season in classic centre-forward fashion. It was a landmark moment for him, and the 25-year-old has surprised many with the pace of his acclimatisation to European football since joining Derby County from Charlotte FC last summer. Agyemang now has as many goals as compatriot Haji Wright in the league this season, and if he keeps going at this rate may also overtake the Coventry striker's haul in his own debut campaign in England (16). He is also on track to usurp Josh Sargent (who scored 13 goals for Norwich City in his first year in the Championship, albeit after scoring two goals in the Premier League the season before). But while Wright came to England on the back of a successful spell in the Turkish top flight with Antalyaspor and with Bundesliga experience at Schalke under his belt, Agyemang's CV is very different. The striker had no MLS academy experience, started playing college soccer with division three Eastern Connecticut University before transferring to Rhode Island in 2020, where he remained until being drafted by Charlotte in 2022. The MLS club saw his raw potential, as did scouts from Derby, before they paid £8million ($10.9m) for him on the back of two seasons in MLS. Now, USMNT boss Mauricio Pochettino must be giving the Connecticut-born forward some serious thought, too. Is he already ahead of Sargent, in limbo amid his attempts to leave Norwich during the winter window, and catching up with Wright in the pecking order to support first choices Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi? “I thought Patrick at times today was unplayable,” Eustace told the Derby website after their 2-0 win over Swansea on Saturday. He's understanding the tactical side of it a little bit more. “Carlton (Morris) is his mentor from the start of the season and even when he's been injured, he's looking after Patrick and helping him, so those two will play a big part in what we want to do until the end of the season.” Agyemang may yet play a part in the USMNT's next World Cup warm-up games against Belgium next month and then Portugal in April. The major talking point after the Turin side lost 3-2 against league leaders Inter may have been a controversial red card for his team. But McKennie's ongoing contributions cannot go unnoticed. After scoring last week in the draw with Lazio, he turned creator on Saturday, setting up both Juve goals at San Siro. The American's performance won't be remembered as much as that awful second yellow (and red) for Pierre Kalulu, and yet another VAR debate, but when the dust has settled, it's fair to wonder if there is a Serie A midfielder in better form than the 27-year-old this season? It may have only been for 17 minutes, but Christian Pulisic was back on the pitch and enjoying that winning feeling for Milan on Friday. As he strives to overcome a persistent muscle issue, the USMNT star has not started for the Rossoneri since January 18. Busio scored an impressive free-kick to begin the rout, sending Venezia top of Serie B and on track for promotion. It's Champions League time again, with several Americans involved in play-off fixtures to determine their teams' progress. The action kicks off on Tuesday when Juventus face a daunting trip to Galatasaray in Turkey (12:45pm ET, Paramount +). Later that day, Balogun and Monaco have a tough match against familiar opponents, as they face reigning French and European champions Paris Saint-Germain (3pm ET, Paramount +). On Wednesday, Bayer Leverkusen travel to Olympiacos for the first leg of their double-header (3pm ET, Paramount +). Diego Simeone's team must navigate a trip to Belgium against Club Brugge (Wednesday, 3pm ET, Paramount +). In the Europa League, Auston Trusty and Celtic will look to keep their good form going, after they stayed in contention for the Scottish title with a 3-2 comeback win at Kilmarnock on Sunday. Finally, on Wednesday, in domestic action, Villarreal play Levante (2pm, ESPN +). USMNT defender Alex Freeman came on as a 79th-minute substitute against Getafe at the weekend, and he is edging closer to a first start for the Spanish side since his winter transfer from Orlando City. He has also worked as a news and sport journalist for the BBC and hosts a podcast in his spare time.</p>

According to a report by NTA on Monday, the match will mark the first-ever senior meeting between the two nations and forms part of Jordan's preparation for their debut World Cup appearance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been a heck of a week for the future of the World Cup in Kansas City. Three FIFA top-10 teams announced they will make Kansas City their home for the World Cup this summer — Argentina, England and the Netherlands. How did Kansas City become the only metropolitan area in the country with base camps for three top-10 teams? I dug into that in a column earlier this week — how Kansas City transformed from a long-shot World Cup host city into what FIFA officials are referring to as the base capital of the tournament. I shared a brief version of this anecdote in Friday's column, but Argentina capped their only visit to Kansas City in the most Kansas City fashion. At the conclusion of their half-week trip, former Sporting KC chief operating officer Alan Dietrich, the lead tour guide for the base camp visits, asked Argentina representatives if they were interested in Latin food or authentic Kansas City barbecue. Five of them — Dietrich plus four Argentina officials — went to Jack Stack, its downtown Freight House location. On the Argentina group's request, they ordered five two-meat platters of food. The Kansas City Combo, Jack Stack calls it. When offered dessert, they each ordered the carrot cake and triple chocolate brownie. “They kept saying, ‘This is really good,'” Dietrich said. It's not why Argentina settled on Kansas City. But it sure didn't hurt the experience. “It was cool, because definitely part of the heart of Kansas City is the barbecue,” Dietrich said. Argentina didn't visit KC until after the draw was unveiled. Even though the star-driven team will open the defense of its 2022 title with a match at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium, the soccer world still anticipated it would base camp in Miami, the MLS home to their star, Lionel Messi. The beach city is less than a 3-hour plane ride to each of Argentina's group-stage matches. But when Argentina sent a half-dozen officials on the trip to Kansas City, the KC2026 group began to think maybe they could persuade them. Their hotel location on the Missouri side?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inside, fans will be treated to large concourses with a variety of options and aside from the prices, the facilities should have few complaints. While a huge arena surrounded by tens of thousands of car parking spaces is a common sight in the U.S., many international fans are used to walking to matches. There are hotels withing walking distance of MetLife, but signs have been posted by the New Jersey State Police warning that it is 'illegal' and 'dangerous.' The comments were flooded with fans sharing similar experiences. "I have suffered the MetLife many times," wrote one. "My 2 pennies' worth (largely irrelevant I know but, hey, that's twitter) ... was at the MetLife last summer for CWC and it is genuinely, surprisingly s***. A truly horrible experience," another added after watching the Club World Cup. "I hope, but don't expect, that some of the lessons from last summer have been learnt." One responded said: "Y'all didn't know New Jersey is designed for cars and not pedestrians since forever?" "The European mind cannot comprehend this level of car centrism," added another. Everyone has a car, so there is no need for other infrastructure. It's what the World Cup is all about. Quarterbacks of all-time - Can anyone better Tom Brady? Wide receivers of all-time - Does Randy Moss or Jerry Rice come out on top? Running backs of all-time - Stacking Jim Brown, Barry Sanders, Walter Payton, Emmitt Smith and more Tight ends of all-time - How does Travis Kelce compare? MetLife Stadium will hold eight matches as part of a massive 32-team tournament. They include five group stage games, in Groups C, E, I and L, plus a round-of-32 clash, last-16 fixture and the final. It opened in 2010 at a cost of $1.6 billion and was part of New York's failed bid for the 2012 Olympic Games, which went to London. Nine games at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup were held there, including both semi-finals and the final in a trial run for July. If you click a link in this box out, we will earn affiliate revenue.
