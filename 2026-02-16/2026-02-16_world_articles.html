Fort Snelling, Minnesota – Last week, Native activists established a prayer camp near the site of a former internment camp for Dakota people. The camp was established in Fort Snelling, Minnesota, just across a highway from the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, which has become a major center for immigration enforcement detainment processing, but the site has a much longer and more complex history. The United States used Fort Snelling as a concentration camp during the Dakota Indian Wars to imprison thousands of Dakota and Ho-Chunk people in abysmal conditions. Migizi Spears, Red Lake Nation citizen and organizer for First Nations United, helped establish the camp, along with Dakota, Nakota and other tribal citizens. Spears said he felt it was time to take back the land that his ancestors lost and from which they were removed following the Dakota War of 1862, also known as the Sioux or Dakota Uprising. “We are getting the land back for our Dakota people who were exiled out,” Spears said. The camp has drawn the attention of media organizations, including CBS News Minnesota and Unicorn Riot, as well as many social media influencers. Wasuduta, Dakota, said the use of the former Fort Snelling site as a federal detention center serves as a reminder of the federal government's ongoing efforts to deprive Native people and Hispanic immigrants of their rights. He said he's hopeful more Indigenous peoples, non-Native allies and tribes will get involved in the effort to get the federal government and the state of Minnesota to give land back to Native people. “It's time to hold them accountable with diplomacy,” he said. “We're not here to be hostile or trigger them.” ICT is an independent, nonprofit multimedia news organization covering Indigenous issues and communities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Property where abuse took place purchased for $13.4m in 2023 by Texas businessman Donald Huffines' family The family of a self-identified “Trump Republican” running for office in Texas bought Jeffrey Epstein's New Mexico ranch where the sex trafficker abused teenage girls and young women, according to new documents. A spokesperson for Donald Huffines, a Texas businessman and former GOP state senator now running for comptroller, confirmed the purchase to the Santa Fe New Mexican, a local media outlet. “Four years after Mr Epstein's death, the Huffines family purchased property in New Mexico listed at public auction whose proceeds benefited his victims,” a spokesperson for the family, Allen Blakemore, wrote to the outlet. He is campaigning to “DOGE Texas government”, a reference to the controversial so-called department of government efficiency, once run by Elon Musk, which conducted chaotic mass federal workforce layoffs and cancelled billions in federal contracts and grants. Huffines' campaign website describes him as “a successful businessman, 5th-generation Texan, and Trump Republican who will bring a private-sector mindset to the Comptroller's office and put Texas first”. He touts endorsements from “top MAGA leaders”, including Ted Cruz, the late Charlie Kirk, former college swimmer turned anti-trans activist Riley Gaines, Ron Paul and Vivek Ramaswamy. After making the release of the files a feature of his 2024 presidential campaign, he then retreated, only releasing more files following intense bipartisan pressure. The Zorro ranch was a place where powerful men allegedly visited, including a former governor of the state. It was also the alleged setting for Epstein's previously reported plans to spread his DNA across the human race by impregnating as many women as possible. Newly released photos showed that at various times the late French modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel, linguist Noam Chomsky and film-maker Woody Allen were guests.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Croatia refused to transport Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia following a request from the two countries, Croatian Economy Minister Ante Susnjar said on Feb. 16. The transport of Russian oil through the Druzhba pipeline via Ukraine has been halted since late January due to relentless Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, according to Ukrainian officials. In the meantime, Szijjarto accused Kyiv of stopping oil flows for "political reasons." Ante said that no EU country has any "technical excuses" left for remaining dependent on Russian oil. "A barrel bought from Russia may appear cheaper to some countries, but helps fund war and attacks on Ukrainian people. Along with Slovak Economy Minister Denisa Sakova, Szijjarto earlier sent a letter to Ante, saying that their countries' sanctions exemption "provides the possibility to import Russian oil by sea if pipeline deliveries are disrupted." "We therefore expect Croatia, unlike Ukraine, not to endanger the oil supply security of Hungary and Slovakia for political reasons." The Druzhba pipeline, one of the world's largest with a capacity of 2 million barrels per day, is a critical conduit for oil from Russian fields to European refineries. As tensions between Kyiv and Budapest grew, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha posted a photo last week showing the burning Druzhba after a rare Russian strike on the pipeline on Ukrainian territory. Ukrainian forces have attacked the pipeline multiple times on Russian soil. They could not even pronounce the word 'Russia,'" Sybiha wrote on X. Based in Kyiv, she focuses on domestic affairs, parliament, and social issues. Kateryna also studied at journalism schools in the Czech Republic and Germany. Herman Halushchenko, Ukraine's former energy minister, was charged of money laundering and involvement in a criminal group as part of the country's major corruption scandal, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) announced on Feb. 16. Dismissing any approximations to Article 5 as mere "rhetorical expressions," Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys named financial support for Ukraine's military or future EU membership as more realistic guarantees. "A barrel bought from Russia may appear cheaper to some countries, but helps fund war and attacks on Ukrainian people. It's time to stop that war profiteering," Croatian Economy Minister Ante Susnjar said. The 7th Corps report comes as Ukraine clings to its last positions in Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad in eastern Donetsk Oblast, both of which have mostly been occupied by Russia, Emil Kastehelmi, a military analyst with the Black Bird Group, told the Kyiv Independent. The strikes targeted areas where Moscow had concentrated its troops, along with a Russian communications hub and a drone control center, the report read. Russian forces attacked Ukraine with four Zirkon anti-ship hypersonic missiles, an Iskander-M ballistic missile, a Kh-31 medium-range missile, and 62 drones, of which about 40 were Shahed-type, the Air Force said. Sumy Oblast Governor Oleh Hryhoriv reported that a Russian drone targeted unspecified "medical infrastructure" in the city of Sumy overnight on Feb. 14-15, causing damage to the target.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dana Eden, an Israeli producer best known for co-creating the Apple TV show “Tehran,” was found dead on Sunday in Athens, where the show's fourth season was being filmed, Greek police said. Police said that her death is being treated as a suicide, Reuters reported. “We mourn the passing of our friend and partner in a long line of productions, series and programs at the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation,” Kan, Israel's public broadcaster, said in a statement. Kan said that Eden had traveled to Greece to oversee the “complex and significant production” of the fourth season of “Tehran,” a spy thriller that premiered in 2020 and received an International Emmy Award in 2021 for best drama series. “Her professional work, uncompromising commitment and love of creation have left a deep mark on the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation,” Kan added. “Tehran” follows the plight of Tamar Rabinyan, a young Mossad agent born in Iran but raised in Israel who returns to Iran on a mission to sabotage Iran's nuclear program. Since Israelis are banned from visiting Iran, the show was filmed in Athens, due to its similarities with the Iranian capital. In her Emmy acceptance speech, Eden said that working on the show with Iranian actors who had fled the regime showed her that “we have a lot in common.” It's also about understanding the human behind your enemy,” she said. Much of Eden's work was in collaboration with Shula Spiegel, who also worked as a producer on “Tehran.” The pair's production company, Dana and Shula Productions, said Eden's death was “a moment of great pain for the family, friends and colleagues.” Miki Zohar, Israel's culture minister, said he received the news of Eden's death “with great sadness,” praising her as “one of the most prominent and influential producers in the Israeli television industry.” “Dana left a deep mark on Israeli creation and brought our story to international stages with pride, talent and courage. May her memory be a blessing,” Zohar said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tech billionaires want to create their own city-states. If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. In April 2025, Peter Thiel's Palantir made headlines after documents were released detailing its partnership with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to create ImmigrationOS, a massive database of information gathered from a variety of sources including the IRS, in order to surveil, detain, and deport immigrants. In fact, the tech mogul is one of the billionaires leading our modern-day version of tech neocolonialism, the new-yet-old imperial monster that colonizes land, extracts resources, exploits natives, and is happy to profit off of their suffering. As a Honduran immigrant myself, I would know. In 2009, Honduras found itself in turmoil after a military coup destabilized the country leading to unprecedented levels of violence and repression. Taking a page out of the “shock doctrine” playbook, the elite political actors behind the coup (including narco-dictator Juan Orlando Hernández, now pardoned by Donald Trump after being sentenced to 45 years in prison for drug trafficking and weapons charges) watered down environmental protections on Honduran land and approved illegal contracts to sell Indigenous and protected land to the highest bidder. Among other corrupt dealings and land grabs, the government approved a law that enabled the creation of Peter Thiel's Zones for Employment and Economic Development (ZEDEs). ZEDEs derive from the idea of “charter cities.” Proposed by former World Bank executive and economist Paul Romer, these proposed cities are enclaves within lower-income nations that “promote economic growth” through privatization and the disposal of national regulations, while gifting major tax incentives for foreign nations to invest in businesses. ZEDEs are a tech billionaire's dream: unbridled power, tech fantasy, and resource hoarding, where the government is run by AI and cryptocurrency is the main currency. Próspera (one of the three ZEDEs in Honduras) even has a Bitcoin center paired with tech companies that offer $25,000 gene therapy and “subdermal implantation services and a variety of cybernetic upgrades.” Próspera is located in Roatan, a Honduran island named one of the World's Greatest Places in 2023 by TIME magazine. Roatan is a Caribbean tropical beauty surrounded by the second-largest coral reef in the world, and home to rich Afro-descendant culture, the Garifuna people who have been fighting threats to their sovereignty for centuries. A sought-after spot for foreign luxury tourism and investment, Roatan saw the foundation of Próspera in 2017 with funding from the likes of Peter Thiel and Pronomos Capital led by Patri Friedman, a grandson of Milton Friedman, seen by many as the father of neoliberalism, deregulation, and privatization. Greicy, an Indigenous Garífuna woman from Triunfo de la Cruz on the coast of Honduras, identifies similarities between the ZEDE in Próspera and other illegal land grabs and land dispossession in her ancestral hometown. Due to safety concerns, Greicy is only sharing her first name for this article. “Even though they say otherwise, I see that only the rich are benefiting, knowing full well that we Garífuna people live off the beach, we live off tourism, we live off fishing, and we also live off growing our own food, cultivating our own food, harvesting and planting our own food. But now we don't have any land left,” she said. Harassment, violence, and threats from the Honduran police force led Greicy to migrate North to New Orleans, standing as a living testimony of how neocolonialism has displaced millions of families in the Global South. Despite the ruling, the Honduran state has not started any process of restitution, with threats and violence towards Garifuna leaders persisting. Yes, it would be worse because we know that all these special economic development zones benefit high-ranking officials, wealthy individuals with investments, and foreign investors who attend political meetings. Concerns regarding ZEDEs and neocolonialist dispossession of communities on the North coast of Honduras often involve drug-trafficking activity, including money laundering, says Greicy. When they go to the beaches, supposedly for tourists, and all that, that's also money laundering, because the beach is a free zone, merchandise is smuggled there, everything is sold there. And someone like me, living in the town, just stays quiet because of fear…. Greicy's fear is not unfounded: Research on special economic zones such as the ones in China has documented “economic gray zones” inside the enclaves where drugs, money laundering, and human trafficking abound. ZEDEs are the tech billionaire representation of neocolonialism; taking hold of Honduran land, resources, and a workforce to build playground empires for tech billionaires to avoid constitutional protections, government accountability, or even human rights protections. In 2022, the new government of Honduras repealed the ZEDEs law, which led to a $10.7 billion lawsuit from Thiel's Próspera that could bankrupt an already struggling country. In December 2025, Honduras concluded a presidential election completely tainted by U.S. intervention via Donald Trump's public support for the right-wing Nationalist Party candidate Nasry Asfura, as well as Trump's threats to cut U.S. aid to Honduras if another candidate won. If the expansion of more ZEDEs in Honduras were to happen, “immigration is going to get worse, because we know that those of us who are here want to leave, and the people who are there are being forced out and will come here. It is not the first time Thiel has used people of color in crisis as a laboratory for his monstrous oligarchic fantasies. Thiel's Palantir is one of the main providers of advanced AI targeting software and hardware to Israeli forces; the technology is used to target, surveil, and murder Palestinians. As a genocide continues under a ceasefire that has not been respected by Israel, Palantir continues to, as its CEO Alex Karp said in an understatement, “occasionally kill people.” Palantir not only provides the technology to massacre Palestinians but also trained its AI models with secretly received National Security Agency raw data of emails and phone conversations between Palestinians in occupied territories and their family in the U.S. We are one more resource they will gladly extract, whether it is our land, labor, data, or our own lives. As data centers gobble up resources in the form of drinkable water and energy, the technology they house exploits people of color, whether it's through biased facial recognition tech or predictive policing technology that tries to criminalize us. Just like the Spanish colonized Latin America through forced labor, extraction of resources, and subjugation of the Indigenous peoples, Peter Thiel and his gang of tech billionaires are drafting up plans to re-colonize Latin America, occupying land, displacing native inhabitants, and then profiting from surveilling and incarcerating them after they are forced to flee to the United States. Thiel, conveniently, has lately been preaching the coming of an “antichrist” in the guise of environmentalism, guardrails on technology, and international agencies, even singling out Greta Thunberg as the possible antichrist. Ultimately, Palantir's ImmigrationOS is a weapon that ICE and other government agencies use to detain kidnapped immigrants under inhumane conditions and force them to perform manual labor in detention centers. A trans detainee in a Louisiana ICE jail denounced this forced manual labor in 2025 — in his case, he was force to carry cinder blocks — and then faced sexual harassment after speaking out against this unsanctioned practice. As Palantir facilitates forced labor schemes, Thiel amasses power through his investments in Facebook, Donald Trump, and ZEDEs. From the U.S. to Honduras, tech billionaires are waging a war on people of color. These oligarchs are employing the old and overused re-packaging of neocolonialism and repression as “development” and “progress” — even labeling AI tech as “inevitable.” When feeling overwhelmed by the power and influence of tech billionaires who care not about our lives or the planet but only about endless profit, I remind myself that they are quite literally a 1 percent. They are just another colonizer looking for a scheme to grow power and wealth on our backs. To start, we can always hit them where they care the most, their money — boycott generative AI, fight against data centers, fight against and denounce Palantir contracts being paid with our tax money, and support Indigenous communities fighting against ZEDEs. Let's call them what they are: colonizers that see us, people of color, as their new profit frontier. The need for truthful, grassroots reporting is urgent at this cataclysmic historical moment.

In the United States, it is possible to be unhoused even inside a prison. “Anywhere that's pretty much off camera,” said Bishop, a man imprisoned in the facility who chose not to use his last name out of fear of retaliation. Atticus, another man in the prison, told Truthout he knows at least a couple people living within the prison “who are actually homeless on a more permanent basis, people bouncing around from place to place.” These folks have no bed to sleep in at night, and no place to leave their belongings. Sources imprisoned at South Central described a different sort of housing crisis, one that takes place inside the walls of the institution that is charged with providing for them. LGBTQ+ people in the prison say this violence often targets them specifically. Conditions at South Central are just one example of the broader problem that LGBTQ+ people face inside prisons, particularly around housing issues. Contemporary prisons in the United States are generally arranged into several sub-units. Within these large institutions, prisons are subdivided into units and what are known as “pods.” According to prison architects, pods offer a “pie-shape” (as opposed to a straight line of cells) and foster both community and more efficient oversight. People living within a pod together share a common room and other daily living activities, and resident experiences in different pods within the same prison can be very different. At South Central, units have two pods, each with 60 two-person cells. The culture of the pod is not only important for a person's everyday well-being, but when it comes to pods and especially cellmates, it is a critical matter of physical safety as well. “It's difficult enough dealing with being locked up on your own, but when you have to go home at night to a little bitty box with someone who you do not get along with, that just makes it all the more complicated.” “It's difficult enough dealing with being locked up on your own, but when you have to go home at night to a little bitty box with someone who you do not get along with, that just makes it all the more complicated,” said Atticus, who has faced harassment over his bisexual identity. Having a bad cellmate can be dangerous, even life threatening. Tavaria “Varia” Merritt, a trans woman also imprisoned at South Central, says she has often been called to offer support for LGBTQ+ people after sexual assaults in the prison, including for folks at risk of suicide. Safety is a major concern for everyone in prison, but LGBTQ+ people face unique and heightened risks. Department of Justice statistics show trans people in prison experience sexual violence at more than 12 times the rate of other people in prison. And LGBTQ+ people are also locked up at higher rates. Describing his own struggle arriving to the prison a year ago and feeling targeted, he says the fights and close calls make you wonder how many chances you have left before something is fatal. He says constant mistreatment from anti-queer podmates “makes you feel like less than a person.” The group is impressive in its scope, holding weekly meetings organized under the umbrella of the Unitarian Universalist church and organizing a wide variety of classes, including crochet and music, that support LGBTQ+ people in exploring their identities, finding kin, and building community. Several members spoke to Truthout about how their housing crises were resolved by the group's advocacy. In gang-controlled areas of the prison, it's common practice to demand “rent” from any unaffiliated people. And they got on that problem so quickly, it surprised me. She moved heaven and Earth to find a place for this complete stranger, me. When she talked to Truthout, Merritt estimated there were five or six people in the hole (another term for solitary) for this reason. In story after story, Be the Change members describe a complete lack of help from staff in the prison for housing problems. Bishop points out that 134 people “count out” — a form of attendance taking — within his pod at the end of the day, which only has a capacity of 120, indicating the problem is no secret to guards. Victor, a gay man and vice president of Be the Change, says staff would “deliberately put people who they knew would have problems with me” in his cell. Sources also report rampant theft of their belongings from inside their cells, and believe this is accomplished with help from guards letting people into the cell and ignoring who lives there and who doesn't. Worse than indifference, Victor, a gay man and vice president of Be the Change, says when he arrived to South Central before Be the Change's founding, what he experienced was an “institutional level of homophobia.” He says at that time staff would “deliberately put people who they knew would have problems with me” in his cell. Just as often, it seems, prison administrators determine that an LGBTQ+-specific unit or pod is discriminatory. The federal Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) is supposed to mitigate some of these risks, particularly the increased risk of sexual victimization, by offering a set of guidelines that includes rules around with whom people can be housed and when they must be consulted. According to Advocates for Trans Equality, PREA standards indicate that “LGBT people may be housed in separated, dedicated housing units only if such placement is voluntary or is based on a case-by-case assessment that includes other factors; if the unit also houses other groups of vulnerable individuals; or if the unit was established as part of the resolution of a lawsuit to protect LGBT people.” Prism reports that the Trump administration issued a memo on December 2, 2025, ordering auditors to ignore key PREA standards related to trans and intersex people. Recently, however, Merritt says the facility has stopped following it. Be the Change members explain that everyone inside has a “PREA compatibility status” of either victim, aggressor, or neutral. While this may seem to be protective, Victor told Truthout, “I think the worst thing you can have as far as your PREA status is being a victim, because it's so difficult to find a roommate.” Victor says that in some cases, he and others have awoken in the morning to find their status changed overnight, without warning and for no apparent reason. These changes disturb the housing situations that people have been able to find for themselves. In interviews with Truthout, sources at South Central implied that people do not want to name that they've been sexually assaulted because it will complicate their housing situation. Self-Organization Can Only Go So Far Within the Carceral System Be the Change and self-organized groups like it in prisons across the United States are finding ways to care for themselves and others, as the state refuses to house and care for those it has forced into its custody. Be the Change members emphasize how lucky they feel to have found Merritt and her group. “I started this to form a safe haven for those who will be considered prey in prison,” said Merritt. Sometimes, he said, Be the Change's attempts to work in respectful ways makes it even harder for them to assert their dignity without violence. Within a context where the group's work is constantly derailed, Be the Change stands out as an example of how people in prison struggle to care for each other.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Experts say discounts on IVF procedures an attempt to fulfil campaign promise but savings only a fraction of total cost TrumpRx, the US president's much-anticipated drug discount program, went live earlier this month with coupons available for just 43 medications, including four required for in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures, and experts say this is probably a half-measure to fulfill Trump's 2024 campaign promise to make IVF treatment universally accessible. There is a search function on the TrumpRx website, but most Americans are unlikely to type in their prescription medications and see results. Although patient circumstances, location and insurance mean that the calculation is different for everyone, Tipton says “pharmaceutical costs are typically 10 to 20%” of the total cost of IVF, which also includes expenses like egg retrieval procedures that require sedation. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates that TrumpRx discounts will save patients up to $2,200 per IVF cycle, but each cycle can cost as much as $30,000 out of pocket. “However, if you have built your opposition to pregnancy termination on the fiction that a fertilized egg is the same as a baby, then IVF is dangerous to you.” Tipton suspects that the Heritage Foundation's influence has prevented Trump from taking further steps to expand IVF access. In its January report, entitled “Saving America by Saving the Family: a Foundation for the Next 250 Years”, Heritage Foundation writers argue that embryos are “sacred human beings” and that IVF is therefore ethically questionable, as not all embryos created in the process survive. Some of the medications listed on TrumpRx could be used either for IVF or for what the Heritage Foundation has labelled “restorative reproductive medicine (RRM)”, which Paulson said is a scientifically dubious term. “It's deceptive,” Paulson said, because the philosophy behind RRM “is that you need to be restored”. By this logic, “infertility is not a disease, it's a manifestation of other problems, and you need to fix those problems, and when you do, your infertility will go away”, he said, likening this to other Make America Healthy Again (Maha) logic, such as the idea that diet can fix chronic illnesses. If you just eat red meat, everything's going to get better,” Paulson quipped, in reference to the health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's refrain about the benefits of protein. The health department did not respond to a request for comment about TrumpRx and its fertility offerings. For example, IUI raises the risk that patients will become pregnant with twins or even more babies at once, which in turn raises the risk of pre-term births and other related problems. Still, Heritage Foundation analysts have stated that they can accept IUI, so long as it only involves the sperm and egg of a married man and woman, while remaining hostile to IVF. Paulson supports individual patients' right to make medical decisions based on faith, but does not think faith should guide medical policy: “If you start with the Bible and see that as the truth, and then you filter everything through that prism, then you're going to come up with different conclusions than those people that are just looking at the science, and that's the problem.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Workers decried John Paulson's plan after billionaire painted himself as advocate for domestic manufacturing John Paulson, a hedge fund billionaire and one of Donald Trump's earliest Wall Street backers, is planning to offshore an Ohio manufacturing plant to China despite heavy pushback from employees. Conn Selmer, the largest US manufacturer of brass and orchestra instruments, told the union it planned to offshore most work at its Eastlake, Ohio, plant to China by the end of June 2026, eliminating 150 jobs. United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 2359, which represents the 150 employees, said workers were informed of the closing when it first sat down to bargain over their new union contract last month. “We came in with a full proposal, fully prepared to bargain, and they started off with a presentation of telling us how bad we were doing,” said Robert Hines, president of UAW Local 2359 and an employee at the plant. Workers say offshoring is an attack on the union, citing rhetoric that the plant has not been productive despite previous praise from company management. Union workers say Conn Selmer opened a facility in China last year and gradually shifted their workload to that plant, though workers were told the new facility would not affect workload in Ohio. “Almost immediately they started taking parts from certain product lines,” Hines said. He noted co-workers began complaining about brass metal coming from China that had to be scrapped due to poor quality. Paulson made a significant portion of his wealth by betting against the housing market that crashed in 2008. A longtime Trump donor, he served on Trump's economic policy team during his first presidential campaign and raised $50.5m for the president at his Palm Beach home in April 2024. He was in the running to serve as secretary of treasury during Trump's second term but withdrew because of “complex financial obligations”. We need to protect American jobs and protect American manufacturing,” he said during an interview with CNBC in September 2024. Hines said offshoring the brass plant would be deeply offensive to workers after Paulson painted himself as an advocate for domestic manufacturing. “To go publicly on CNBC to support the Trump administration's positive views on tariffs and all that stuff, and then you turn around and [say you] want to go send the work right over to China,” Hines said. Hines noted he hopes Trump steps in to stop the decision. “This decision can still be reversed,” he said. In early February, the union held a rally in Eastlake, Ohio, as part of efforts to save the plant from closing. “It really pisses me off,” said one worker in the video. The White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>

Obama found himself in the spotlight over the weekend after he appeared to confirm the existence of aliens in an interview he did with US podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen. “They're real but I haven't seen them,” replied Obama. “And they're not being kept in… what is it? There's no underground facility unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.” On Sunday evening, Obama issued a statement to clarify his position. He posted the clip of his original comments on Instagram, accompanied by a short statement, saying: “I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it's gotten attention let me clarify. “But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we've been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. In an appearance on “The Late Late Show with James Corden.” He said: “What is true, and I'm actually being serious here, is that there are, there's footage and records of objects in the skies, that we don't know exactly what they are. “We can't explain how they moved, their trajectory. They did not have an easily explainable pattern. And so, you know, I think that people still take seriously trying to investigate and figure out what that is.” Obama compares ICE's ‘rogue behavior' in Minnesota to dictatorships Conspiracy theories involving extraterrestrial life have long abounded about Area 51, a highly classified United States Air Force facility located at Groom Lake in southern Nevada. One popular UFO conspiracy is that in 1947 in Roswell, New Mexico, remains from a flying saucer that supposedly crashed were taken to Area 51 for reverse engineering experiments in order to replicate the extraterrestrial spacecraft.

MOSCOW, February 16. /TASS/. Compared with the rounds in Abu Dhabi, the Geneva talks on Ukraine will cover a wider range of topics and address all key issues, including those related to territories, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.

"This time, we plan to discuss a broader set of issues, focusing on the key ones related to the territories and other demands. That is why the presence of our chief negotiator, [Vladimir] Medinsky, is required," the Kremlin spokesman explained.

The first round of trilateral security consultations between Russia, the US and Ukraine took place on January 23-24 in Abu Dhabi. The Russian negotiating team was led by Igor Kostyukov, head of the Main Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff. The second round was held in the UAE capital on February 4-5. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced that the next round of negotiations on the Ukrainian settlement will also take place in a trilateral Russian-American-Ukrainian format on February 17-18 in Geneva. According to him, the Russian delegation will be led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Drawing from the Hanseatic League, a 13th-century alliance, could help middle powers leverage their strengths Fen Osler Hampson is Chancellor's Professor at Carleton University. This essay is part of the Prosperity's Path series. In a time of geopolitical instability and a shifting world order, the challenges facing Canada's economy have only gotten more visible, numerous and intense. Prime Minister Mark Carney won many plaudits for his recent speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in which he warned that the rules-based economic order is over, and that “middle powers” such as Canada must work together against great-power coercion. The speech continued making waves at last week's Munich Security Conference. Also last week, Mr. Trump threatened to block a new Windsor-Detroit bridge and demanded to be “fully compensated for everything we have given” to Canada – despite the fact that Canada paid for the entire project. Without action to back up Mr. Carney's words, our lives will get harder and meaner. Canada, along with other advanced democracies such as Britain, Norway, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and the countries of the European Union, should look beyond traditional diplomacy. This group, which grew out of German towns, successfully formed a commercial and defensive network to stave off the predations of neighbouring states such as Denmark, England and Russia. The power of such an alliance today would come not from military strength, but from the sophisticated market-power leverage these countries exercise over global finance and trade. The true Achilles' heel of the U.S. is its exposure to its creditors and foreign investors, with its net foreign debt – public and private – now standing at more than $27-trillion, compared to only $8-trillion a decade ago. When the threat of instability begins to manifest itself as a spike in bond yields (which move inversely with prices) or a sudden decline in share prices, the economic costs of predatory behaviour are immediately apparent. By themselves, each is not enough to make the United States blink. But if they were to coordinate their risk assessments, this group could act as a kind of global financial security council. If a great power engaged in behaviour that undermines international stability through economic coercion or a violation of state sovereignty, the world's middle powers could signal their plans to recalibrate their vast financial holdings. These countries are also large economies in their own right. Unlike the U.S., China is a net creditor country, and so is not vulnerable to a coordinated retreat from its asset markets. However, this net asset position has been built up by chronic trade surpluses, generated by an economy that produces way more than it can consume. As with its military counterpart, the new league should have a permanent secretariat that could war-game potential threats and responses, while maintaining continuous informal communications between central bankers, fund managers, finance ministers and political leaders. Prime Minister Mark Carney has been widely praised for his recent speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, in which he warned that the rules-based economic order is over, and that 'middle powers' must work together against great-power coercion.Sean Kilpatrick/The Associated Press This should not be too difficult, given their reactions to Mr. Carney's speech and how their moment of unity carried the day at the forum. Moreover, there is an existing platform off which to build: Canada has already set up the Ottawa Group, a collection of middle powers including the EU that has sought to preserve a rules-based trading system. Mr. Carney should then bring the leaders together for an inaugural meeting that would make clear the league's willingness to use its collective economic and financial muscle. This kind of convening role is well suited to Canada's diplomatic strengths: We were heavily involved in the creation of original postwar international institutions, such as the UN or NATO itself. Neither the U.S. nor China is likely to welcome such an alliance, and Canada, with its dependence on the American economy, may be particularly vulnerable. Economic and financial coercive measures also carry a cost for the states imposing them. A coordinated sell-off of U.S. bonds, for example, pushes down their value and hurts the countries selling them, too. U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to acquire Greenland struck a nerve in European capitals, prompting some of the strongest criticism yet from NATO allies.ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP/Getty Images However, standing up for oneself always carries a price, no matter the method, and that price is small compared to the cost of rolling over. We are less dependent on the United States than Mr. Trump likes to think: The reality is that the U.S. trades with Canada not because it likes us, but because it needs our energy and raw materials. The path forward for middle powers lies in recognizing that their strength is primarily financial and economic over military.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has stated that he opposes Ukraine's fast-track admission to the European Union, citing the will of its citizens. He also warned that his government would not change its stance on the issue, despite political attacks and interference in the Hungarian elections by Vladimir Zelensky. "Over the past week, political attacks from Ukraine have reached a new level. Zelensky has directly intervened in the election campaign in Hungary by speaking out against the Hungarian government," Orban wrote on Facebook (banned in Russia, owned by Meta, recognized as extremist in the country). Orban said Zelensky allows himself to make political attacks and personal insults because "Hungary does not support Ukraine's fast-track accession to the EU." By his actions, "he is essentially calling into question the sovereign decision of the Hungarian people," the prime minister added, recalling that in 2025 a majority of Hungarian citizens voted against Ukraine's accession in a nationwide referendum. "As Prime Minister of Hungary, I am obliged to ensure that the decision of the Hungarian people is respected. I will do this again and again, regardless of whether Zelensky likes it or not," Orban assured. In response, Orban stated that Ukraine would not become a member of the European Union. The Hungarian government has repeatedly warned that it will not allow Ukraine to be admitted to the EU in a hurry, arguing that such a move could create the threat of direct military confrontation with Russia and cause significant damage to the European economy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian attacks on Sumy Oblast on Feb. 15 caused damage to local infrastructure and injured four people, local officials reported. Sumy Oblast Governor Oleh Hryhoriv reported that a Russian drone targeted unspecified "medical infrastructure" in the city of Sumy overnight on Feb. 14-15, causing damage to the site. While the exact weaponry used in the attack was not immediately clear, Ukraine's Air Force warned throughout the day of Russian drones targeting various communities of Sumy Oblast. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 15 that over the past week, Russia launched around 1,300 attack drones, more than 1,200 guided bombs, and 50 missiles, nearly all of them ballistic, at Ukraine. Zelensky said Russia continues to deliberately target Ukraine's energy infrastructure, including power generation facilities, substations, and the power grid, while also striking residential areas.

Dismissing any approximations to Article 5 as mere "rhetorical expressions," Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys named financial support for Ukraine's military or future EU membership as more realistic guarantees. "A barrel bought from Russia may appear cheaper to some countries, but helps fund war and attacks on Ukrainian people. It's time to stop that war profiteering," Croatian Economy Minister Ante Susnjar said. The 7th Corps report comes as Ukraine clings to its last positions in Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad in eastern Donetsk Oblast, both of which have mostly been occupied by Russia, Emil Kastehelmi, a military analyst with the Black Bird Group, told the Kyiv Independent. The strikes targeted areas where Moscow had concentrated its troops, along with a Russian communications hub and a drone control center, the report read. "This is a second time for the past year, when a Ukrainian woman who is a refugee and is hiding for safety in North Carolina, gets murdered by a man," said the brother of the late Kateryna Tovmash. Russian forces attacked Ukraine with four Zirkon anti-ship hypersonic missiles, an Iskander-M ballistic missile, a Kh-31 medium-range missile, and 62 drones, of which about 40 were Shahed-type, the Air Force said. Herman Halushchenko, Ukraine's former energy minister, was charged of money laundering and involvement in a criminal group as part of the country's major corruption scandal, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) announced on Feb. 16. Sumy Oblast Governor Oleh Hryhoriv reported that a Russian drone targeted unspecified "medical infrastructure" in the city of Sumy overnight on Feb. 14-15, causing damage to the target.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Multiple enlistment officers were hospitalized after a "group of civilians" allegedly carried out an attack on the personnel in Odesa on Feb. 15, the Odesa Oblast Regional Recruitment Center reported. The officers were escorting a "violator of military registration" when they were confronted by an unspecified number of civilians that engaged in "aggressive physical pressure" against the officers, the recruitment center said in a Facebook post. The attack also damage a military vehicle and cameras. Specifics were not provided as to how many officers were injured or the extent of the injuries sustained. As Ukraine steps up its mobilization efforts, draft offices are often accused, at times justly, of forced conscription without compliance with fundamental civil rights and ill-treatment of conscripts. Ukraine's Human Rights Ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, told parliament on Feb. 9 that he had received 6,127 complaints in 2025 over possible violations committed by enlistment officers. Moscow has capitalized on controversies surrounding mobilization, often using propaganda to help escalate social tensions in Ukraine and further damage Ukraine's recruitment efforts. Personnel shortages have dogged Ukraine throughout its fight against Russia. In the summer of 2025, Russian forces launched several strikes on enlistment offices in the cities of Kryvyi Rih, Poltava, Kremenchuk, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhzhia, damaging infrastructure and causing civilian and military casualties. These attacks were viewed as an escalation in tactics, aimed at disrupting Ukraine's mobilization efforts and fueling social unrest. Dmytro Basmat is a senior news editor for The Kyiv Independent.
