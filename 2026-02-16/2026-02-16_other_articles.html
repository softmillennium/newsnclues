                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The former president clarified comments he made about extraterrestrial life on a podcast over the weekend. Former U.S. President Barack Obama said he did not see evidence that aliens “have made contact with us,” after sending social media abuzz by saying aliens were real on a podcast over the weekend. During a lightning round of questions with podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen, Obama was asked, “Are aliens real?” “They're real,” he answered, continuing: “But I haven't seen them. And, they're not being kept in Area 51.” On Sunday, the former president released a statement on Instagram, appearing to clarify what he meant by his comments that have since gone viral. “I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it's gotten attention let me clarify. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we've been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Secrecy around Area 51, a top-secret Cold War test site in the Nevada desert, has long fueled conspiracy theories among UFO enthusiasts. Declassified documents referred to the 8,000-square-mile installation by name after decades of U.S. government officials refusing to acknowledge it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ever since Robert Johnson supposedly sold his soul to the devil at a crossroads in return for musical success, the music world has been filled with legends and conspiracy theories. Things have gotten worse thanks to the internet, as there's hardly a single modern celebrity that has remained untouched by some outlandish rumour or not been attributed a bizarre urban legend. Most of them are baseless, with one or two speculations capturing the collective imagination through renewed interest – much like the new forensic report suggesting that Kurt Cobain's death may have been a homicide staged as a suicide. We start with the biggest music conspiracy theory of them all: Paul McCartney died in a car crash in 1966, and the former Beatle was replaced by a lookalike. Fans understood this visual as a funeral procession: John Lennon is the clergyman in white; Ringo Starr is the mourner in black; and George Harrison is grave digger in denim. The VW licence plate in the background reads ‘28IF' - as in: Paul would have been 28 years old IF he had lived to 1969. McCartney has responded on many occasions, trying to dispel the rumour. When he quoted Mark Twain when issuing a statement that read: “Rumours of my death have been greatly exaggerated." This conspiracy stems from the album cover of David Bowie's 1972 masterpiece ‘The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars', which sees Bowie standing on 23 Heddon Street under a sign that says "K. Never mind that the sign belonged to a furrier store... West” was code for “Quest” and over the years, fans have dug deeper. You see, the album features the song ‘Five Years' and in 1977, a certain Kanye Omari West was born... Coincidence? The theory doesn't end there though, as Bowie's final album was titled ‘Blackstar' - something which many interpreted as the chameleon of rock anointing his successor, ie: Kanye ‘Ye' West. The cause of death was due to fatty degeneration of the heart, possibly caused by obesity and crash dieting. Strangely enough, The Who's Keith Moon died in the same flat and bed as Mama Cass four years later, also aged 32. This led many to declare Nilsson's apartment as cursed. Some Elvis fans still don't want to believe that the King of Rock'n'Roll died on the toilet on 16 August 1977, as a multitude of conspiracy theorists – nicknamed “Alivers” - state that Presley faked his death and did not die of a massive heart attack. The King's autopsy was kept confidential as he was a US spy who entered the witness protection program, and the whole truth can be found in a suppressed, top-secret, 633-page FBI report that the US government is keeping under lock and key. Another album cover that seems to hide some secrets... Ergo: the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks were predicted by Supertramp! Several songs over the years have been accused of containing subliminal messages, with fundamentalist Christian groups always keen to condemn popular tracks as satanic through backmasking – a recording technique in which a message is recorded backward onto a track that is meant to be played forward. The most infamous theory was that Led Zeppelin's classic ‘Stairway to Heaven' was an ode to Old Nick, as it contains the backward message: "It's my sweet Satan... Oh I will sing because I live with Satan.” Music fans love to speculate over the death of an icon, with many claiming that musicians never died at all or that foul play was involved. Popular ones include: the previously mentioned Elvis theory; Jimi Hendrix didn't overdose and was murdered by his former manager; the CIA was responsible for Bob Marley's death; Jim Morrison didn't really overdose in a bathtub; Michael Jackson faked his death and still alive. But the most persistent conspiracy theory surrounds Kurt Cobain's death. The Nirvana frontman's body was found at his Seattle apartment on 5 April 1994 and his cause of death was ruled to be a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the face, as Cobain has been wrestling with drug abuse and depression for years. However, countless Nirvana fans still insist that it wasn't suicide and that Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, had something to do with it. A 1998 documentary by Nick Broomfield titled Kurt & Courtney ran with these theories, discovering evidence that Cobain was going to divorce Love and uncovering testimonies that Love had allegedly arranged his murder to retain her husband's fortune. Later, a 2014 documentary, Soaked in Bleach, also explored the conspiracy surrounding Cobain's suicide, and theaters showing the film were met with a cease-and-desist notice from Love's law firm – something which only fuelled speculation further. Three decades since Cobain's tragic death, a new independent investigation has reignited debate over what truly happened, challenging the suicide ruling, and affirming that the suicide could be a staged homicide. Exploring Kurt Cobain's overlooked social activism – 30 years since his death Forensic experts' new report claims that Kurt Cobain may have been murdered Dave Gahan once allegedly bit a journalist's neck in 1994, and has admitted to sleeping in a coffin-shaped bed. That's enough for some to be convinced that Depeche Mode's frontman is a blood sucking creature destined to roam the planet for centuries – while giving us hits like ‘Enjoy The Silence', ‘Personal Jesus' and ‘Walking In My Shoes.' If this turns out to be true, we're not complaining. Melissa is taller, wears more skirts, and Avril changed musical influences over her career far too many times. Fans are just probably in denial that the artist who gave them hits like ‘Complicated' and ‘With You' was ever capable of delivering the cultural appropriation trash that is ‘Hello Kitty'. Stevie Wonder has been faking his blindness, according to certain corners of the internet. Born prematurely and having developed a condition called retinopathy of prematurity, Wonder's blindness came under scrutiny when he was seen onstage with Paul McCartney at the White House in 2010. During the show, Wonder appeared to catch a mic stand that McCartney knocked over. Cue: insane conjecture that the legendary soul artist has been fooling everyone for decades. Wonder has spoken openly about his blindness, and has had some fun over the conspiracy that he isn't really blind. In 2017, he said: “This year, I will reveal the truth.” The truth is that he's blind and people have waaaaay too much time on their hands. The official story goes that six-year-old JonBenét Ramsey was killed in her parents' home in Boulder, Colorado, on 25 December 1996. On 26 December, she was reported missing and her body was found seven hours later in the basement of the house. The case remains unsolved, an open homicide that has led some to suspect that she could still be alive. But if you haven't seen Kitty Green's 2017 documentary Casting JonBenet, make that your next watch. It doesn't make a lick of sense. Not so Crazy in Love: Why is Donald Trump demanding that Beyoncé be prosecuted? Can we stop pretending the Katy Perry-Blue Origin space trip was anything but a crass PR stunt? She's behind Michael Jackson's death and knew all about P-Diddy! Her album 'Renaissance' is a harbinger of the Apocalypse! Conspiracy theorists just won't see reason when it comes to Queen Bey, believing that she's conspiring to control world affairs and rule the world as the supreme head of the Enlightenment-era clique. But considering the current state of play, wouldn't the world be better off as one giant Bey Hive?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The owner of a skincare brand has spoken about being part of Charlotte Tilbury's founding team, setting up a business and appearing on Dragons' Den. Danielle Close, from Hove, is the founder of My Skin Feels, a sustainable skincare brand which uses by-products from organic tomato ketchup, olive oil, breakfast oats and orange juice manufacturing. After training at a London makeup school, she became part of the founding Charlotte Tilbury team. She was just 19 when she became Tilbury's intern, moving on to become a PA and rising up the ranks first as a social media and finally marketing executive. I learned to never accept no for an answer, as well as her tenacity and drive – that's now innately in me thanks to her.” In 2023 she launched My Skin Feels from her flat behind Hove Station. “The beauty industry is so messed up and unsustainable,” she said. Danielle using the My Skin Feels face wash (Image: Supplied) Thanks to their upcycled orange juice, no "new water" is used in the products, and the brand donates one per cent of sales to the Brighton and Hove Food Partnership to help fight food waste locally.

She trained in mediumship for seven years and sees clients once a week. “The last three years I've been on my own," she said. "Everyone launches online but we've done the opposite; rain or shine I've been at a market. In an episode aired on Thursday (February 5), the Dragons praised Danielle's “brilliant” pitch, saying they loved her “energy” and describing her as a “really good storyteller”. Peter Jones, Deborah Meaden and guest investor Gary Neville all offered Danielle all the money she asked for, but for 20 per cent of the business. “For a few days after filming I was really disappointed and I was disappointed because I knew that was not the right decision to make for the business,” she said in a video posted online. “20 per cent for £50,000 – no matter who it is, celebrity or not celebrity – is not the value of the hard work I put in and it just felt wrong.” While waiting for the Dragons' investment, some angel investors approached Danielle and offered her a “much bigger amount of money for a much smaller percentage”. Danielle insisted the decision was not a “snub” to Neville and Meaden.</p>

The brevity of Obama's comment sparked a frenzy of speculation online, prompting the former president to issue a clarification on Instagram 24 hours later. "I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it's gotten attention let me clarify," he wrote."

Obama, whom Trump succeeded in 2017, had previously spoken out against the federal immigration operations in Minneapolis following the killings of Alex Pretti and Renee Good by federal agents. In a statement with his wife Michelle posted on X after Pretti's death, Obama claimed that Trump and officials in his Administration “seem eager to escalate the situation” instead of “trying to impose some semblance of discipline and accountability over the agents they've deployed.” “I would hope that after this most recent tragedy, Administration officials will reconsider their approach.” The Trump Administration said Thursday it is winding down its massive immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota following months of unrest over excessive use of force by immigration officers in the state, including the shooting deaths of Pretti and Good. “I have proposed and President Trump has concurred that this surge operation conclude,” border czar Tom Homan told reporters in a press conference in Minneapolis on Thursday. President Donald Trump sent Homan, his top immigration advisor, to Minnesota late last month to address large-scale protests over excessive use of force by immigration officers in the state. Homan took over leadership of “Operation Metro Surge” from Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino and quickly set up meetings with local and state leaders, including sheriffs, police chiefs, Governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison. Obama also responded indirectly to the recent controversy over a video posted by President Donald Trump that depicted him and First Lady Michelle Obama as apes. When asked about it, Obama commented on how there is a "sort of clown show that's happening in social media and on television.” "What is true is there doesn't seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sense of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office. Trump has refused to apologize for posting the video, saying he instructed a staffer to share it but that he had not seen the offending part. "I didn't see the whole thing," Trump said. This story was updated to include President Obama's clarification on his comments about extraterrestrial life.
