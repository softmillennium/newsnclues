                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Jackson Laboratory–New York Stem Cell Foundation Collaborative (JAX-NYSCF) today announced a five-year strategic research collaboration with GSK focused on advancing human cellular models of neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer's disease. The collaboration reflects a strategic focus that brings together human stem cell research, advanced data science tools, and large-scale research systems to help close a long-standing gap between scientific discovery and the development of new medicines. "Now we have the opportunity to extend those discoveries -and accelerate therapies to patients-by bridging traditional disease models with next-generation patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models that more accurately capture the complexity of human biology at scale." By integrating GSK's deep knowledge of neurodegeneration, translational science and drug discovery with JAX-NYSCF's pioneering stem cell technology and expertise, access to relevant patient cohorts, and automation platform, the partners aim to build more predictive models of neurodegenerative diseases for identifying and prioritizing promising drug candidates. Establishing a translational biology and scientific discovery collaboration with JAX-NYSCF complements the work we are doing at GSK on cellular models of disease, and offers the potential to yield new insights that may help accelerate therapeutic discovery for devastating neurodegenerative diseases, building on our established expertise in immunology and inflammation. Chris Austin, senior vice president and global head of Research Technologies at GSK Brain microphysiological systems are reshaping in vitro neurotoxicity testing through functional validation and advanced disease modeling. Targeted protein degradation presents a promising strategy to address antimicrobial resistance, focusing on innovative approaches for gram-negative bacteria.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The study, which pooled data from 67 studies encompassing more than 28,000 musicians across 21 countries. The research found that 42.6% of musicians reported tinnitus (ringing in the ears), compared to just 13.2% in control populations. Many musicians quietly live with ringing ears, sound sensitivity, or hearing loss, no matter whether they play in a symphony hall or a small club. Yet the research we have is still imperfect, often based on self-reported symptoms and missing details about things like other loud hobbies, specific instruments, and how consistently people use hearing protection. What we really need now is more personal, musician-entered risk profiling so we can offer practical, tailored advice that helps artists protect their hearing without sacrificing the music they love." Among musicians with hearing loss, approximately 63% of cases were based on subjective self-report, with only about 37% confirmed through objective audiometric testing - suggesting the true prevalence may be even higher than reported. Notably, the study found no significant difference in the prevalence of hearing loss, hyperacusis, or tinnitus between classical and pop/rock musicians. This challenges previous assumptions and suggests that auditory risk extends across musical genres. The authors note that individual factors such as instrument type, seating position within an ensemble, room acoustics, and attitudes toward hearing protection may play a more critical role in auditory risk than genre alone.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®) today published new NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) for Pediatric Soft Tissue Sarcomas. The guidelines present the latest evidence-based, expert consensus-driven recommendations for nearly every type of cancer plus prevention, screening, survivorship, and supportive care. NCCN Guidelines are updated at least once a year and help cancer care providers worldwide to attain the best possible outcomes. They focus on a subtype called rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) which is the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma in people under 20. "Most cancers that occur in children are fundamentally different from cancers occurring in adults," explained Stephen Skapek, MD, Duke Cancer Institute, Chair of the NCCN Guidelines Panel for Pediatric Soft Tissue Sarcoma. That's why it was essential to form a group of leading, multi-disciplinary experts from across the country to put together a roadmap for diagnosing, risk stratifying, and treating these patients." Children are most likely to be diagnosed with RMS at a very young age, toddlers or early elementary school. When treating someone so young, you are not looking to just prolong survival, the goal is a full cure with minimal side effects and zero recurrence." RMS is tricky to diagnose; it can be located almost anywhere on the body. When it presents in the head, neck, or limb, it can show up as a lump with or without pain. Other times it occurs on an internal organ, which might cause problems for breathing or urination. There are three major risk groups with varying survival rates. The new NCCN Guidelines explain how to provide treatment in a way that balances the goal of cure with the need to minimize acute side effects, such as severe infections, and long-term effects that could bring additional problems at some point in the future.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fred Hutch Cancer Center scientists reached a crucial milestone in blocking Epstein Barr virus (EBV), a pathogen estimated to infect 95% of the global population that is linked to multiple types of cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and other chronic health conditions. Published in Cell Reports Medicine, the study highlights one of the newly identified monoclonal antibodies that successfully blocked infection in mice with human immune systems when they were challenged with EBV. Finding human antibodies that block Epstein Barr virus from infecting our immune cells has been particularly challenging because, unlike other viruses, EBV finds a way to bind to nearly every one of our B cells. A key challenge in the study was to pursue human monoclonal antibodies that could successfully halt EBV infection without triggering an anti-drug response to the antibodies themselves, a common response among patients treated with antibodies raised in other animals. The researchers targeted two antigens, gp350, which helps EBV bind to cell receptors, and gp42, which allows EBV to enter and infect human cells through a process called fusion. "Not only did we identify important antibodies against Epstein Barr virus, but we also validated an innovative a new approach for discovering protective antibodies against other pathogens," noted Crystal Chhan, a pathobiology PhD student in the McGuire Lab. With help from Fred Hutch's Antibody Tech Core, further analysis found sites of vulnerability that could be useful in future vaccine development. More than 128,000 people in the U.S. undergo solid organ and bone marrow transplant annually. However, there are no specific therapies to prevent EBV from infecting or reactivating in patients undergoing immunosuppression for transplant procedures. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) are an aggressive and sometimes life-threatening lymphoma that can develop after immune suppression and is most often caused by unchecked EBV infection. "Preventing EBV viremia has strong potential to reduce the incidence of PTLD and limit the need to reduce immunosuppression, thereby helping preserve graft function while improving overall patient outcomes. Effective prevention of EBV viremia remains a significant unmet need in transplant medicine." Transplant recipients may experience infection if their donor was exposed to EBV and passed on latent virus through the donor cells, or for transplant patients who already have had EBV infection, immunosuppression may cause latent virus in their bodies to replicate unchecked. Children undergoing immunosuppression for transplant could especially benefit from a specific therapy to prevent EBV, as a higher proportion of children have not yet been exposed to EBV. Fred Hutch has filed for intellectual property rights covering monoclonal antibodies identified in the study, and McGuire and Chhan are working with scientific collaborators and an industry partner to advance a potential therapy for immunocompromised patients. A potential therapy could be tested for safety in healthy adult volunteers and, if acceptable, proceed to clinical trials in the relevant patient population. "After many years of searching for a viable way to protect against Epstein Barr virus, this is a significant stride for the scientific community and the people at the highest risk of complications from this virus."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Harlequin ichthyosis (HI) is a rare, severe genetic skin disorder caused by ABCA12 mutations, leading to defective lipid transport and loss of skin barrier function. Historically fatal, survival has improved with neonatal intensive care and systemic retinoids. This review covers pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, management, genetic counseling, and emerging gene-based therapies. Newborns are encased in rigid hyperkeratotic scales that compromise barrier function, leading to life-threatening complications. Recent advances in neonatal care and retinoid therapy have enabled long-term survival, and the genetic basis-ABCA12 mutations disrupting epidermal lipid transport-is now well established. In HI, loss-of-function mutations prevent glucosylceramide transport, impairing formation of the stratum corneum lipid barrier. This triggers compensatory keratinocyte hyperproliferation, massive keratin accumulation, and retention of corneocytes. The resulting rigid plates restrict chest expansion, while fissures permit fluid loss and pathogen entry. Newborns display pathognomonic thick, yellow-white plates separated by deep erythematous fissures, severe ectropion, eclabium, flattened ears/nose, and joint contractures. Complications include respiratory distress, feeding failure, dehydration, temperature instability, and sepsis. Long-term, survivors face persistent hyperkeratosis, scarring, ocular issues, and psychosocial burden. Prenatal diagnosis via CVS or amniocentesis detects ABCA12 mutations in at-risk families. Postnatal diagnosis is clinical, confirmed by genetic testing to distinguish HI from other ichthyoses. Neonatal care focuses on fluid balance, infection prevention, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Systemic retinoids (oral acitretin) initiated early are disease-modifying, accelerating scale shedding and improving pliability. Ophthalmologic lubrication and surgical correction address ectropion; physical therapy manages contractures. Historically fatal, survival now extends into adulthood with aggressive care. Quality of life varies; long-term retinoid use requires monitoring for hepatotoxicity and skeletal effects. HI is autosomal recessive; carrier parents have 25% recurrence risk. Reproductive options include prenatal diagnosis and preimplantation genetic testing. Counseling provides recurrence risk assessment and emotional support for informed decision-making. Gene therapy and CRISPR-Cas9 correction of ABCA12 in patient-derived cells are under investigation. Novel pharmacologies targeting alternative lipid pathways and nanotechnology-based topical delivery are early in development.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The way we understand the movement of our own bodies plays an important role when learning physical skills, from sports to dancing. But a new study finds this phenomenon works very differently for people learning to use robotic prosthetic devices. "When people first start walking with a prosthetic leg, they think their bodies are moving more awkwardly than they really are," says Helen Huang, corresponding author of a paper on the work. "With practice, as their performance improves, people still do a poor job of assessing how their bodies move, but they are inaccurate in a very different way. "This is the first study to look at this phenomenon in people using lower-limb robotic prosthetics, and it raises a number of questions that should help us improve people's ability to walk with these devices," says Huang, who is the Jackson Family Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering in the Lampe Joint Department of Biomedical Engineering at North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Everyone has a personal body image – an understanding of how their body is structured, how it moves, and so on. And this understanding of our bodies informs the way we move. When learning a new physical skill, such as dancing, we have a mental image of how our bodies are moving – but that's often not the way our bodies are actually moving. We wanted to learn more about how and whether people who are using robotic prosthetics incorporate that prosthetic device into their body image. Does that change as people become more familiar with using these devices? Is there any relationship between incorporating these devices into one's body image and their performance using these devices?" Participants practiced using the prosthetic device each day. After each practice, participants were shown a computer animation that displayed a range of different biomechanical walking gaits, and were asked to select which gait was closest to their recent performance using the prosthesis. "By the end of the four-day study, participants felt their gait was more fluid and natural than it actually was. The performance of all participants did improve significantly over those four days. However, the participants were all still inaccurate at assessing the way their own bodies moved – just in a more confident way." "One reason for this is likely because they are receiving very little direct feedback about the behavior of the device – they can't see themselves moving," Huang says. "This raises the possibility of improving performance by giving people visual or other feedback they can use to calibrate their body image and gait while training with the prosthetic device. "It will also be important to address the overconfidence people have in their own movement skills," Huang says. We think it would be valuable to find a way to give people a more accurate assessment of how their body is really moving."

Conversely, de-escalation strategies are being studied to minimize toxicity, overtreatment, and long-term side effects in patients with lower-risk or highly responsive tumors in patients with early-stage disease. In early-stage, HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, genomic profiling tools can determine whether chemotherapy or extended endocrine therapy adds meaningful benefit. Patients with low recurrence scores tend to have a low risk for distant relapse and excellent outcomes; therapy can often be de-escalated to endocrine therapy alone. In low-risk HR-positive, HER2-negative disease with a low genomic score, adjuvant chemotherapy typically adds limited benefit while increasing toxicity. Further, CDK 4/6 inhibitors are typically not indicated in this low-risk setting. Platinum-based regimens are generally not standard for the routine treatment of stage IA HR-positive, HER2-negative disease. Contemporary response-adapted strategies tend to focus escalation on patients with residual disease while exploring de-escalation for complete responders. Given these results, experts suggest that treatment de-escalation can be considered for patients with TNBC who achieved complete pCR. ctDNA in early breast cancer is promising but still in the analytical and clinical validation stage, with clinical decision-making applications generally trial-based rather than standard. In low-risk, node-negative, HER2-positive disease, an approach using a limited duration of taxane-based chemotherapy paired with single-agent anti-HER2 therapy (followed by completion of anti‑HER2 therapy) has demonstrated excellent long-term disease control in prospective studies. This strategy intentionally avoids anthracyclines and other intensive multi-agent regimens to reduce treatment burden without compromising patient outcomes in appropriately selected patients. Anti-HER2 therapy alone is generally not considered an adequately validated approach for most patients in this risk category outside of specific circumstances (eg, comorbidity or chemotherapy contraindication) or clinical trials. These approaches target micrometastatic residual disease, improving disease-free survival in higher-risk subgroups identified by biology and stage rather than demographics alone. Age by itself is not a primary escalation trigger as well. Family history affects genetics or risk of developing cancer and might prompt genetic testing, enhanced screening, and consideration of risk-reducing surgery, but it does not directly escalate systemic therapy for an already-diagnosed early HR-positive tumor in the way nodal burden does. For patients with early-stage breast cancer, partial-breast irradiation is a recommended de-escalation option following lumpectomy. This method has proven equivalent to whole-breast radiation in preventing local recurrence, with reduced treatment time and toxicity. Data have shown that individualized radiotherapy de-escalation (whether by limiting volume, dose, or duration) can preserve excellent local control. Radiotherapy omission is only considered in narrowly defined populations, often older patients with very favorable tumor biology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In most animal cells, this process depends closely on properly functioning mitochondria, the organelles responsible for respiration and energy production. A new study published in Nature Metabolism now shows that this dependence is not irreversible. An international team led by José Antonio Enríquez of the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III (CNIC) and the Spanish network for research into frailty and healthy aging (CIBERFES) has experimentally uncoupled nucleotide synthesis from mitochondrial activity using ScURA, a yeast-derived genetic tool now available to the research community that will enable new explorations of cellular metabolism. In complex organisms such as humans, respiration is essential for generating the energy required for life, with the mitochondria in our cells using oxygen to sustain vital cellular processes. By contrast, some organisms-such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae-can survive without oxygen and have evolved alternative metabolic pathways to produce the molecular building blocks required for RNA and DNA synthesis. Building on this observation, the team identified a yeast enzyme that can sustain nucleotide synthesis independently of mitochondrial respiration. Instead of oxygen, this enzyme uses fumarate, a metabolite derived from nutrients. Unlike cells from healthy individuals, the patient-derived cells used in the study cannot grow in standard laboratory conditions because they require extra supplementation with nutrients and DNA precursors. The results were striking: human cells expressing ScURA continued to produce DNA and RNA even when the mitochondrial respiratory chain was blocked. The team also discovered that ScURA helped cells use their nutrients more efficiently without disrupting other essential cellular functions-an important first step toward the more ambitious goal of improving the lives of people with mitochondrial disorders. Mitochondria not only produce energy; they also shape fundamental processes such as DNA synthesis. Our work shows that if we provide a cell with an alternative route to make nucleotides, we can sustain cell proliferation even when mitochondrial respiration fails." José Antonio Enríquez, lead author, head of the CNIC GENOXPHOS group One of the study's most important findings is that ScURA-modified cells can grow without uridine supplementation, a common strategy used in laboratories to compensate for mitochondrial defects. Moreover, the new approach restores cell proliferation across different experimental models of mitochondrial diseases, including those caused by severe mutations in essential respiratory chain complexes. For first author Andrea Curtabbi (CNIC), "this tool allows us, for the first time, to clearly separate the direct effects of mitochondrial dysfunction on nucleotide synthesis from other secondary metabolic changes." Mitochondrial diseases are severe and often untreatable, and in the laboratory cells with impaired mitochondrial respiration require external supplements to proliferate. However, when the researchers inserted ScURA into these cells, they proliferated under standard conditions in the same way as healthy cells. The study also shows that this imported enzyme boosts the efficiency of nutrient use without altering other essential cellular functions, making ScURA a highly valuable experimental tool. The authors further highlight its potential for clarifying mitochondrial contributions to rare diseases and cancer. "Identifying which metabolic processes become limiting when mitochondrial respiration fails is crucial for designing precise therapeutic strategies," concludes Enríquez.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hospital admissions for maltreatment of children under the age of 2 years declined 31% during the 16-week lockdown at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, returning to prepandemic levels after restrictions lifted, according to new research published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.251317. However, after the 16-week period of restricted health care access, rates of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for child maltreatment increased by 80%. "We consider that the observed decrease and subsequent stabilization in hospital admission incidence rate during the pandemic may be attributable to delayed case identification or lack of admissions to investigate more minor injuries, rather than a true decline in the population incidence of child maltreatment - young children experiencing maltreatment that may have warranted hospital admission did not appear to present to care during the period of restricted health care access," writes pediatrician Dr. Matthew Carwana, BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, British Columbia, with coauthors. "This early underdetection, as well as ongoing pandemic-related stress, may have led to the subsequent increase in ICU admissions." The strict public health measures enacted during the first period of the pandemic disrupted normal routines, closing schools, restricting access to primary care physicians, and increasing household stress and parental isolation. These factors could lead to increased child maltreatment, yet few studies have examined the impact of the pandemic on child maltreatment. Researchers from POPCORN (Pediatric Outcomes Improvement Through Coordination of Research Networks) compared hospital admissions in the pandemic period from Mar. 3, 2016, to Feb. 29, 2020) using data from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) for all provinces and territories except Quebec, and from l'Institut national d'excellence en santé et en services sociaux (INESSS) for Quebec. As admissions to ICUs increased after the 16-week period of health care restrictions ended, it may indicate child maltreatment during this phase of the pandemic. "This raises concern that children may have been living in unsafe situations or experiencing abuse that went undetected during the period of the most stringent public health measures. It also highlights the potential importance of hospital admissions for assessment of sentinel injuries consistent with child maltreatment that could prompt action to prevent more severe presentations," the authors write. They suggest that, in preparing for potential future pandemics, planners should ensure there are mechanisms to identify cases of child maltreatment, even during periods of public health restrictions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bioengineered E. coli bacteria can now produce a group of compounds with anticancer, anti-HIV, antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory activities. Plants produce many substances with promising pharmacological activities. For example, Rhododendron species produce a class of compounds, called orsellinic acid-derived meroterpenoids, with remarkable anticancer, anti-HIV, antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory activities. However, despite their attractiveness for pharmacological research, their natural origin makes them unreliable and expensive to produce and previous attempts at the microbial production of the core compound, orsellinic acid, have only reached disappointingly low yields. There are many examples where compounds appear promising in the literature but fail to advance sufficiently in evaluation or applied research due to supply issues. I began to feel this is less an issue with individual compounds and more a structural challenge facing natural products research as a whole." Using a combination of introducing appropriate genes from plants, fungi and bacteria, analyzing the organism's metabolism and optimizing the culture conditions, they set out to create the first production platform for these compounds ready for industrial-scale production based on the widely used bacterium E. coli. In the journal Metabolic Engineering, the Kobe University bioengineers now publish that they achieved a production of 202 mg orsellinic acid per liter, which represents a 40-fold improvement over the previously reported microbial production. Tomita, who is the study's first author, says, "It is a significant achievement that we recreated a complex eukaryotic biosynthetic pathway in the bacterium E. coli, something that was previously thought difficult." In addition, the group also introduced a further gene from Rhododendron that completed the biosynthesis of a pharmacologically relevant compound. As a representative for the class of pharmaceuticals, the Kobe University team chose grifolic acid, a compound known for its potent anticancer and analgesic properties. But the group's aims go far beyond this. However, the rational design strategy employed here serves as a foundational technology for the production of various complex compounds using E.
