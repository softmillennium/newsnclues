In fact, in terms of the overall lugubriousness of Stella (Lesley Manville) and Gerry's (Ciarán Hinds) impromptu vacation to the sheer dour vibes of the chilly, gray Amsterdam weather, director Polly Findlay's new film seems to say, “Hold my Guinness.” Though Manville and Hinds are incapable of performances that are anything less than fantastic, “Midwinter Break” serves up just about the most depressing holiday imaginable — and in a moviegoing season in which we are all already reeling from the most depressing winter ever. More like “The Winter of Our Lives.” The script here is too stiffly restrained to a fault to make much of an emotional impact, even as spending time with these actors historically is never without pleasures. Related Stories ‘Queen at Sea' Review: Juliette Binoche Guides Director Lance Hammer Back to Screens with a Searing Film About Dementia and Consent Sundance 2026 Movies Sold So Far: Olivia Colman Comedy ‘Wicker' Lands at Black Bear Their lives, it appears, have sunken to the nadir of mundanity in retirement, with Gerry deep in his cups, boozing with a grim resolve, and Stella also not not about to bring out the wine a little too early in the day. It all has something to do with a vaguely foreshadowed accident she was involved in in Troubles-era Belfast several decades ago, while heavily pregnant — a cold infusion of snippets of which are administered like an IV drip throughout the movie. Gerry, meanwhile, is about as patriotically Irish as Stella is Catholic — not just in the sense of his hard-drinking, but also with former glories of youth he's keen to share with any unsuspecting bartender who is forced to listen. Stella knows she's codependent and complicit — and thus, to break the spell of another lonely Christmas (their son has opted only to phone in for the holiday) followed by another cold, lonely New Year's, Stella surprises Gerry with tickets to Amsterdam. Obviously, it's been some time since they've experienced anything adjacent to an adventure. Despite Gerry managing to score a bottle of whiskey somewhere, offscreen, in customs, his joie de vivre is not immediately refreshed upon arrival in Amsterdam, and neither is Stella's. It soon becomes clear that Stella may have brought Gerry there under false pretenses — whether premeditated or not — because she ends up fixating on a convent, hoping to join the local sisterhood, which would, of course, mean leaving Gerry and his liquor and his statins behind. The rhythms of Gerry's drinking problem start to get repetitive, but, alas, c'est la vie when it comes to the spinning wheel of addiction. And the movie certainly looks picture-pleasant enough, as shot on location by recurring Ben Wheatley cinematographer Laurie Rose. There's also the added element of the film's leading actors, who both give expectedly committed turns in their roles — though one issue here is that the film's primarily target snowbirds-and-up audience doesn't necessarily turn out in theaters for adult-minded dramas (or anything at all) these days. But Stella and Gerry never seem to actually enjoy a minute of this “vacation,” their joylessness ultimately infecting the audience. It's certainly one of Manville's best performances since playing the surrogate mother to a dressmaking control freak in “Phantom Thread” or a hapless, drifting alcoholic in “Another Year” made the long-working British actress something of an item here in the States. But god, if the revelations that come out of Stella's overdue psychic purge don't make you want to catch the next plane out of Schiphol to get to anywhere but depressing here, I don't know what will. “Midwinter Break” opens in theaters on Friday, February 20, from Focus Features.

Lance Hammer was the toast of the town in 2008 with his hard-hitting, Mississippi-set coming-of-age drama “Ballast.” The Dardennes-esque vérité portrait of lives careening from loss and economic hardship won two awards at the Sundance Film Festival that year — including Best Director for Hammer — and received multiple Film Independent Spirit and Gotham award nominations. And then, poof: Hammer was never heard from again. He has now returned, almost two decades later, with an extremely upsetting but compassionate moral drama about agency amid dementia, titled “Queen at Sea.” It stars Juliette Binoche as a woman desperate and panicked to take care of her ailing mother, Leslie (Anna Calder-Marshall), who is slipping deeper into the illness. Leslie's grasp of time, memory, and function is vanishing in the multi-story London flat she shares with her husband of 19 years, Martin (a brutally heartbreaking Tom Courtenay). Related Stories Sundance 2026 Movies Sold So Far: Olivia Colman Comedy ‘Wicker' Lands at Black Bear ‘The Mandalorian and Grogu' Full Trailer: Yes, Pedro Pascal Will Show His Face in This One But when Amanda catches her stepfather, Martin, in a compromising position with Leslie, another separation sets into motion, with Leslie potentially about to be lost in an elder-care system that's frightening and scary for the patient, and all but a death sentence for her and her loved ones. As someone who's watched a close loved one lose themselves to Alzheimer's disease, I found “Queen at Sea” to be especially bruising, even despite some of its patchier plot notes. The geographical configuration surrounding Amanda, having left behind a husband (and Sara's father) in Newcastle, is confusing. Meanwhile, Sara has very quickly restarted her life in Newcastle with new friends and a potential new flame, as writer/director Hammer draws parallel comparisons in the edit between Sara's blooming relationship with a classmate, and Leslie's mental deterioration and estrangement from her own partner. But the Viagra in his medicine cabinet suggests otherwise, that he keeps going back for more, that Amanda keeps asking him to stop. Dementia dramas like Sarah Polley's wounding “Away from Her” (wherein Julie Christie's husband Grant Anderson basically sets her up in a nursing home to counteract his own infidelities) and Michael Haneke's Oscar-winning “Amour” (the harshest of this fleet of films) tend to center close-up on the relations between an Alzheimer's patient and her partner, and how these relationships break down when there are fewer past and present memories to found them on. Hammer's film introduces profound new questions and issues about consent into the formula — is Leslie agreeing on some level to have sex with her husband? Is the only pleasure in her winnowing life to be denied? Leslie's instincts now are narrowed to the primal: food, water, sleep, and, naturally, sex. Which is eventually what happens, and where Leslie forms an inappropriate bond with another patient to fill the Martin void. Writer/director Hammer, though, downplays the melodrama inherent to this scenario, even while shooting sequences, whether in Martin and Leslie's apartment or in various hospitals, with a bracing handheld intimacy. Far from sterilely composed, a rape kit examination forced upon Leslie is harrowing and demeaning, especially as she has no idea what's going on and no clue why a speculum is being inserted into her. In what world could Martin have raped his wife? Binoche, who has been giving committed and emotionally messy but always focused performances for years lately, including in films by Haneke, gives one of her best recent turns in “Queen at Sea.” An emotional phone call to her soon-to-be ex-husband shows blanched vulnerability as she dials the last person she would prefer not to call, but the one she is forced to call anyway. Interior lives outside those determined by this situation may be lacking, but Leslie's isn't. The great British actor Courtenay, most recently memorable in the similarly memory-impaired marriage portrait “45 Years” opposite Charlotte Rampling, is quite devastating as a husband scrambling for answers and to legitimize his own place in Leslie's life. The one element that doesn't quite land, and seems quite literally chopped into the film, is Florence Hunt as Amanda's daughter. Hammer seems to be trying to signal that she may be headed for her own future mental ruin by intercutting her first romance with scenes of Martin and Leslie's last. Ultimately, though, anyone who's endured what Amanda, or Leslie, or Martin do in this movie will find something to relate to and feel toward. But the actors help carry Hammer's message — and make it unforgettable.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The actor had been on an extended weekend bar crawl since Thursday. Shia LaBeouf‘s Mardi Gras bar crawl has come to an unfortunate end. The actor was arrested shortly after midnight Tuesday in New Orleans after he allegedly fought with two men, who told police he assaulted them. Shia LaBeouf's Mardi Gras Bar Crawl: "He's Terrorizing the City" A staff member attempted to eject LaBeouf from R Bar, but after he was removed from the building, LaBeouf allegedly hit one man several times with closed fists. He then, according to the police report, left but came back, allegedly acting more aggressive. After multiple people attempted to hold him down, LaBeouf was let up, the police report states, “in hopes that he would leave,” but he then allegedly resumed hitting the same man who he allegedly punched earlier. The arrest comes after LaBeouf, who recently claimed to be sober and blamed past abusive behavior on alcoholism, went on an extended-weekend bar crawl during Mardi Gras in New Orleans' Uptown neighborhood, according to employees of various drinking establishments. He showed up at 24/7 bar Ms Mae's, around the time the Bacchus super-krewe parade rolled up St. Charles Avenue with thousands of revelers, in what the establishment's doorman said was an “inebriated” state and “somewhat belligerent.” He was also without cash or a shirt, putting the latter back on when he was told he had to. Another bartender, who waited on him last Thursday, said, “He is terrorizing the city!” He was spotted at at least two other bars in the city and was telling people he was staying at a luxury Airbnb.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“We are living through dark, disturbing and dangerous times, but do not despair — the cavalry is coming!” Springsteen says in a statement. We will be rocking your town in celebration and in defense of America — American democracy, American freedom, our American Constitution and our sacred American dream — all of which are under attack by our wannabe king and his rogue government in Washington, D.C. Everyone, regardless of where you stand or what you believe in, is welcome — so come on out and join the United Free Republic of E Street Nation for an American spring of Rock ‘n' Rebellion! “In my home, the America I love, the America I've written about, and has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration. Tonight, we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experience to rise with us, raise your voices against the authoritarianism, and let freedom ring. This took place before Donald Trump flooded Minneapolis with ICE officers, resulting in the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. Springsteen responded to the tragedies with the protest song “Streets of Minneapolis,” which he performed Jan. 30 during a surprise appearance at Tom Morello's A Concert of Solidarity & Resistance to Defend Minnesota! Earlier that month, Springsteen made a guest appearance at the annual Light of Days benefit concert. “Right now we are living through incredibly critical times,” he said that night. “If you believe in the power of law and that no one stands above it,” he continued, “if you stand against heavily-armed masked federal troops invading an American city, using gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens, if you believe you don't deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president, as the mayor of the city said: ICE should get the fuck out of Minneapolis.” If Springsteen sticks to roughly the same set as Europe last summer, expect plenty of politically-themed songs like “Rainmaker,” “Long Walk Home,” and Bob Dylan's “Chimes of Freedom.” It's also a near-certainty he'll play “Streets of Minneapolis” as well. ‘America's Next Top Model' Turned Her ‘Cheating Scandal' Into National News.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nicole Kidman is said to have a new suitor just weeks after finalizing her divorce from Keith Urban. Like the “Eyes Wide Shut” star, Salem is a divorcee. Kidman's reps have not immediately returned Page Six's request for comment. Reports that Salem is romantically pursuing Kidman come just one month after the “Big Little Lies” star and Urban, 58, finalized their divorce on Jan. 6. “Sometimes relationships just run their course,” a source told Page Six at the time, adding that Kidman “did not want the separation and was trying to save things.” She officially filed for divorce from the country rocker on Sept. 30, citing “irreconcilable differences.” By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. “She is refreshed and optimistic about the new year,” the insider also shared before adding that the newly single actress is “looking ahead to a busy and exciting year professionally too, with several projects coming up.” As for Urban, he has since been romantically linked to both his 25-year-old guitarist, Maggie Baugh, and the up-and-coming country singer Karley Scott Collins. While those romance rumors were ultimately dismissed by Collins and a close friend of Baugh's, an insider claimed that Urban had moved in with a new love interest last month. “People think they are even living together,” the insider added. “Look, teen girls love their dads, so there's a reason they're making it three against one.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(Notably, Bad Bunny has performed both of his Hot 100 No. 1s at the midpoint of the NFL championship game: he guested on “I Like It” during Shakira's Super Bowl LIV halftime show in 2020.) 2 on the Hot 100 in January 2025, heads up four Bad Bunny songs, all of which he performed at the Super Bowl, in the top 10, with two others likewise from his 2025 album Debí Tirar Más Fotos: “Baile Inolvidable,” which bounds 19-2 for a new high, and “Nuevayol,” up 28-5, also a new best. Plus, “Tití Me Preguntó,” from his 2022 LP Un Verano Sin Ti, reenters the chart at No. Check out the full rundown of this week's Hot 100 top 10 below. The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Feb. 21, 2026) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Feb. 18 (one day later than usual due to the Presidents' Day holiday in the United States Feb. 16). For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram. Plus, for all chart rules and explanations, click here. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published. The single surges 4-1 for a third week atop the Streaming Songs chart, after it led for two weeks in January-February 2025, and bounds 11-2 for a new high on Digital Song Sales. It's also the top weekly total for the song, which previously peaked with 34.9 million in its first week at No. Plus, it achieves the top streaming week for a song not primarily in English this decade, surpassing its prior best (which bested the 34.6 million tallied by Eslabón Armado and Peso Pluma's “Ella Baila Sola” in May 2023). “DtMF” is the fourth all- or mostly-Spanish-language Hot 100 No. 1 with any portion of its lyrics not in English since HUNTR/X's “Golden, with sections in Korean among its mostly-English lyrics, led for eight weeks last August-October. Some more X's and O's as “DtMF” barrels into the Hot 100's end zone: It's the second song in as many years to top the chart following a Super Bowl halftime show performance. On the Feb. 22, 2025, list, Kendrick Lamar scored a gain of 14 as “Not Like Us” rebounded 15-1 for a third week atop the tally. He also claimed half the top 10 that week. Here's a summary of the totals, and metric increases, for Bad Bunny's four concurrent top 10s on the latest Hot 100: Bad Bunny boasts four simultaneous Hot 100 top 10s for a second time, following his haul on the May 21, 2022, chart — when “Tití Me Preguntó” debuted — as Un Verano Sin Ti launched at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Latin Songs chart, where it's one of Bad Bunny's 17 leaders. Only “Despacito” (56 weeks) has dominated longer since the survey began in October 1986. Olivia Dean's “Man I Need” dips to No. 2 Hot 100 high, as it adds a third week at No. 4 a week after it became her first Hot 100 No. It tops the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart for a 12th frame. Alex Warren's “Ordinary” backtracks 3-6 on the Hot 100 after 10 weeks at No. Taylor Swift's “Opalite” rebounds 11-8 on the Hot 100 after it debuted at its No. HUNTR/X's “Golden” drops 5-9 on the Hot 100 and Bruno Mars' “I Just Might,” which spent its first two weeks on the Hot 100 at No. 1 in January, slides 4-10, as it leads the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot R&B Songs charts for a fifth week each.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Din Djarin is back with some new little puppets and big CGI monsters. Disney shared a new trailer this morning for the upcoming Star Wars flick (not the one you may have seen in theaters ahead of Wuthering Heights this weekend) which sees the titular Mandalorian making his way through the gangsters, war criminals, and generally bad guys on his list. “This isn't about revenge,” says Ward (Sigourney Weaver). “It's about preventing another war.” Good luck with that—this is Disney's Star Wars. There will always be another war. But Din is most concerned about protecting Grogu, instructing him to check his armor and coping with some existential, very parental dread. “The kid will live centuries beyond me,” he says. “I won't always be around to protect him.” He's not the only one with this on his mind; we also get a glimpse of a fleeing baby Greedo, who probably isn't actually named Baby Greedo but is just a juvenile Rodian. Aside from Pedro Pascal as Din Djarin and Weaver, Jeremy Allen White will also star in The Mandalorian And Grogo as Ratta the Hutt.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apparently CBS, despite their thirst for scoops, wanted desperately to avoid the same potential smoke. That's Texas state rep James Talarico,” Stephen Colbert said on The Late Show last night. “He was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers directly that we could not have him on the broadcast. Talking about that good ol' equal time rule, Colbert joked, “It's the FCC's most time honored rule, after no nipples at the Super Bowl.” He went on, “Let's just call this what it is: Donald Trump's administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV, because all Trump does is watch TV, okay? So, it's no surprise that two of the people most affected by this threat are me and my friend Jimmy Kimmel.” Since FCC head Brendan Carr had previously said they should conduct these interviews elsewhere, Colbert said that he'd be posting the interview with Talarico on The Late Show‘s YouTube page, which he did do. As Colbert goes on to point out, Carr's jurisdiction is not just broadcast TV but radio, but has declined to enforce any equal time rules that might apply to the vast ecosystem of right-wing talk radio. You can't get rid of talk radio. What else would your angriest uncle do in traffic? In any case, the exception for late night talk shows hasn't been done away with yet. “But my network is unilaterally enforcing it as if he had. But ladies and gentlemen, I want to assure you, that this decision is for purely financial reasons.” You can watch the whole segment below.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Ticket to Ride movie is in development at Netflix, which has locked down exclusive global rights to Asmodee's popular railway-themed board game. This comes following their acquisition of similar rights to the publisher's other hit game, Catan. Netflix Moves Into MMA With Ronda Rousey & Gina Carano Fight Mel McClelland, VP of the Tannenbaum Company, and McAuley Cahill, VP of Megamix, developed the feature concept from scratch alongside Mekler and Amick. Becoming a pop culture staple since its 2004 launch, Ticket to Ride has sold over 20 million copies and been translated into more than 30 languages. The game has players collect colored train cards with an eye toward claiming railway routes connecting cities on a map — whether of the U.S., Europe, or what have you. “Just when I thought life couldn't get more exciting, Ticket to Ride is teaming up with Netflix,” said Moon. “I can't wait to help bring these exciting projects to the millions of fans of the game.” At Netflix, Ticket to Ride joins a growing portfolio of game-to-screen adaptations, including Arcane, Castlevania, Family Pack (The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow), Exploding Kittens, the upcoming Assassin's Creed series and Monopoly reality competition series, along with a new Gears of War film. The deal was negotiated by CAA and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman on behalf of Asmodee. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

While known for his civil rights activism, Jackson also ran for president in 1984, becoming the second African American to do so after Shirley Chisholm. He was a candidate for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination that year and again in 1988, but didn't win the nomination. In 2017, at Cannes Lions, Jackson called out Hollywood and Silicon Valley for their lack of diversity and pushed the audience — made up mostly of advertisers and marketers — to use their media reach to promote positive messages for women, people of color and the LGBTQ community. Jackson's high-profile work also attracted the entertainment industry's attention in other ways. Actors who have portrayed Jackson on screen include Nigel Gibbs in the TV series Monster (2022), and Eddie Murphy famously parodied Jackson on Saturday Night Live in 1984. He was hospitalized in November after being diagnosed with a degenerative condition. “He died peacefully on Tuesday morning, surrounded by his family. It continued: “Reverend Jackson is survived by his wife, Jacqueline; their children – Santita, Jesse Jr., Jonathan, Yusef, Jacqueline; daughter Ashley Jackson, and grandchildren.

He even acknowledged the trend during a run of arena shows in the U.K. and Ireland last year, where he stared out at a sea of people dressed in black suits, bald caps and sunglasses meeting up outside of venues.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jesse Jackson, the towering civil rights activist and religious leader who worked to improve economic conditions for Black communities and advocated for social-justice causes around the world, died on Tuesday. Jackson's death was confirmed by his family, who said in a statement that he “died peacefully” while surrounded by family. His unwavering belief in justice, equality, and love uplifted millions, and we ask you to honor his memory by continuing the fight for the values he lived by.” A cause of death was not immediately available. In November 2025, Jackson was hospitalized in Chicago where he was put under observation for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a neurological disorder that can affect body movements and balance. PSP is similar to Parkinson's, which Jackson was originally diagnosed with in 2013. He got his start in the Sixties, working closely with Martin Luther King Jr., before founding two advocacy groups, Operation PUSH (People United to Serve Humanity) and the National Rainbow Coalition. (These two were later consolidated into the Rainbow PUSH Coalition.) For a brief moment in 1988, he even took the delegate lead over Dukakis after a massive win in the Michigan caucus. But it was also reforms he advocated for in 1988, which changed how delegates were distributed during the Democratic primary, that made Obama's victory possible, too. And Jackson's campaigns, with their unabashedly progressive platforms, set a mold that future longshot, outsider candidates on the left, like Bernie Sanders, would follow for decades to come. “The issues that we raised were resonating,” Jackson recently recalled in Abby Phillip's book A Dream Deferred: Jesse Jackson and the Fight for Black Political Power. We used to call it ‘poor campaign, rich message.' Born Jesse Burns on Oct. 8, 1941, in Greenville, South Carolina, Jackson was the son of a high school student, Helen Burns, and her 33-year-old neighbor, Noah Robinson. (Jackson learned the identity of his biological father at a young age and maintained a relationship with him throughout his life.) Of growing up in the Jim Crow South, Jackson told The New York Times in 1987, “I remember being taught my place.” He transferred to the historically Black North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College, where he continued to play football, but also became involved in the civil rights movement. He then attended the Chicago Theological Seminary, but dropped out before graduating to work for King. Robert Duvall, Oscar-Winning Giant of New Hollywood Era, Dead at 95 James Van Der Beek Was the Heart and Soul of ‘Dawson's Creek' King appointed Jackson to run Operation Breadbasket under the banner of his Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). As head of the first Chicago chapter, and then the national organization, Jackson focused on encouraging people to patronize Black-owned businesses and organized pickets and boycotts of businesses that refused to hire Black people. Others in the SCLC disputed Jackson's version of events (he was a floor below King at the motel, for instance), leading to further tensions. In 1971, Jackson left the SCLC to found Operation PUSH (the “S” originally stood for “save” before being changed to “serve”). PUSH continued much of the economic-driven work Jackson was doing for Operation Breadbasket, including boycotts of Anheuser-Busch and Coca-Cola in the 1980s. The group's efforts to bolster education in Black and underprivileged communities earned them federal assistance from the Jimmy Carter administration. But while Jackson's profile grew, PUSH frequently faced criticism for poor management and follow-through. When Jackson announced his first campaign for president in November 1983, he was still a polarizing figure and failed to pick up endorsements from prominent Black leaders like Coretta Scott King and Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young. He also faced allegations of anti-Semitism related to his support for a Palestinian state, refusal to disavow Louis Farrakhan, and for referring to Jews as “Hymies” and New York City as “Hymietown” while speaking with a Washington Post reporter. Jackson's momentum grew, and he went on to win more than 3 million votes nationally in the 1984 primary. The Rainbow is mandating a new definition of greatness. Four years later, Jackson significantly expanded his own coalition. He won nearly 30 percent of the popular vote during the primaries while running on a platform that included reversing Reagan-era tax cuts, increasing federal spending for social programs, and implementing single-payer universal healthcare. Clinton later awarded Jackson with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Jackson's stature even allowed him to serve as an ad-hoc diplomat. He went on to bring home citizens being held as “human shields” by Saddam Hussein in Kuwait, negotiate the release of U.S. soldiers being held hostage in Kosovo, and the release of British journalists being held in Liberia. The elder Jackson instead focused on his activist work, merging his two groups into the Rainbow PUSH Coalition and advocating on issues both domestic (health care, gun control, the War on Drugs) and international (ending apartheid in South Africa, pushing for democracy in Haiti, negotiating peace between Israel and Palestine, and speaking out against the Iraq War). In 2007, Jackson became one of the earliest backers of Obama's presidential bid, and his son served as a co-chairman on the future president's campaign. But some friction emerged between the rising political star and his predecessor when Jackson was caught on a hot mic criticizing an Obama Father's Day speech. (“I want to cut his nuts out,” Jackson said. “Barack, he is talking down to Black people.”) Jackson did apologize, Obama accepted, and Jackson was famously caught on camera weeping after Obama's victory in November 2008. Describing the emotions he felt that night, Jackson told NPR, “Well, on the one hand, I saw President Barack Obama standing there looking so majestic. I could not help think that this was their night.” Jackson remained a major figurehead in the final decades of his life, while also settling into an elder-statesman role. Though not directly involved with Black Lives Matter — and sometimes seen as out of step by the movement's young leaders — he gave his support to protesters and often stood alongside the families of Black people killed by the police. In 2021, as he was pushing 80 years old, Jackson was arrested twice within a few months during protests related to ending the Senate filibuster and challenges to the Voting Rights Act. In 2023, Jackson announced his plans to step down as head of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition amid his advancing age and growing health concerns. Still, he continued to make public appearances, including the 2024 Democratic National Convention, and speak out on issues that mattered most to him. ‘America's Next Top Model' Turned Her ‘Cheating Scandal' Into National News. How Gorillaz Reconnected and Made Their Best Album in Years Piper Rockelle on Joining OnlyFans: ‘I've Never Had a Good Reputation' Speaking to The New York Times in 1987, Jackson talked about how he wanted to be seen, especially by the Black community, saying he wanted to be “someone who can sit on television and argue their case.” That was the whole thing with [trailblazing Congressman] Adam [Clayton Powell].

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jesse Jackson has died at the age of 84, according to a report from BBC News. Jackson is probably best known for his pioneering work alongside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as a leader within the civil rights movement within the United States. In his life, he also ran for president of the United States twice during his life as a candidate for the Democratic Party in 1984 and 1988. A statement released to BBC News confirms that Jackson “died peacefully on Tuesday morning, surrounded by his family.” His unwavering belief in justice, equality, and love uplifted millions, and we ask you to honour his memory by continuing the fight for the values he lived by.” Jackson had faced a number of health issues in recent years. Meanwhile,  was hospitalised for observation in November 2025, with doctors confirming he had been diagnosed with a degenerative condition known as progressive supranuclear palsy. American-British playwright Bonnie Greer told BBC News that Jackson was a “great” man and acted as a “big brother to my generation.” She continued, “He was a man who was able to see the big picture, he was able to see the little picture, he was able to put them together to make the idea of America and the world into what he saw – a world where people can not only be equal, they can get better at being equal.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple Martin denied rampant social media rumors she was expelled from a school for bullying. I didn't wanna respond but this narrative is completely false and has gotten so out of hand,” she wrote in a comment she then re-shared to Instagram Stories on Monday. “I completely understand ppl not liking me and that is okay! The internet is a place where ppl can share their opinions. But this rumor is completely untrue, I am not that type of person and anyone who is close to me knows that ❤️.” The daughter of Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, 48, and Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow, 53, previously faced bullying rumors after video footage emerged of her seemingly attempting to crash a fellow debutant's impromptu photo shoot during Le Bal des Debutantes in Paris in December 2024. She was also filmed seemingly rolling her eyes while entering the invite-only gala arm-in-arm with Count Leo Henckel von Donnersmarck. A source close to Paltrow told the Daily Mail at the time that, “Apple's more playful and fun and she's really a total girls' girl.” By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. “She really had such a wonderful evening and I feel bad that this is even taking away from that because it was such an uplifting evening for her and the other girls,” they explained. “I don't know how anyone has a problem with us. “We are two of the funniest girls and I know us, like offline,” one pal mouthed as the camera cut to an image of Ava Crox — who initially shared the video of Apple at her high society debut. “When I tell you, there aren't two more caring, charitable, generous, kind…” the video continued.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hallmark hunk Tyler Hynes was accused of “breaking the internet” yet again by fans who couldn't help but swoon over the vacation pics he posted on February 16, 2026. Hynes certainly deserved to start 2026 with a little R&R after a jam-packed fourth quarter that included two highly anticipated Hallmark movie premieres (“Three Wisest Men” and “Christmas Above the Clouds”), fan events across the U.S., and filming a special new movie expected to premiere this year (more on that later! Based on the photos and videos Hynes shared, he returned to a tropical spot he'd been before, with the same location featured in a post from Earth Day 2025. I can see why you make it your January home. Hynes' latest post showcased a relaxing time away where he was able to skateboard and surf in the sunshine, relax with a beer by the ocean, and take in the local culture. He even shared a video from a tiny Pura Vida plane, often used by tourists in Costa Rica, and monkeys playing in the trees. Fans flooded Hynes' vacation post with cute comments as they swooned, including one who quipped, “Ty breaking the internet on this Monday! Someone else gushed, “Oh my the scenery is so Beautiful ❤️ but Tyler all I can say is your so 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️” and another wrote, “Stunning view of ocean and you!” The Tyler Hynes Shirtless Instagram account (yes, really!) Many also shared their gratitude with Hynes, noting that it was generous and kind of Hynes to share scenes from his vacation. One wrote, “Thank you for sharing and enjoy your time on the beach well deserved 🌊❤️❤️❤️” Another chimed in, “You certainly know how to make the most out of your time spent off the grid. It is incredibly important to pause & take time for yourself, but I'm so glad you choose to share glimpses of your adventures with us. Some of Hynes' Hallmark pals weighed in, too. Kimberley Sustad declared that she's “coming next year” and Taylor Cole added, “😍 yes please 🙌” Go here and check the boxnext to EntertainmentNow And he loves it when his fans swoon. He's not only handsome but a nice guy. Very personable at the Edison NJ Christmas Con. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>
