            Warner Bros. Discovery wants to hear Paramount's “best and final proposal” for the media company, and is opening a brief window for discussions about a bid, while also moving forward with its Netflix merger and urging shareholders to reject Paramount's current hostile bid.
    


            If that sounds convoluted, that's because it is.
    


            Warner Bros. Discovery, or WBD for short, is worth tens of billions of dollars, and the company's board is trying to ensure it squeezes every possible billion out of its suitors.
    


            So it is reopening talks with Paramount, in pursuit of a higher price, while recognizing that Netflix can and likely will match the price.
    


            Netflix, for its part, is criticizing Paramount aggressively, saying that Paramount's “financing challenges and rapid deleveraging plans pose tremendous risk to the entertainment industry.”
    


            Last December, WBD agreed to sell most of the company, including the Warner Bros. movie studio and HBO, to Netflix. WBD's cable channels, including CNN, are not part of the sale.
    


            The deal with Netflix doubled as a rejection of Paramount. But Paramount CEO David Ellison responded by going directly to shareholders with a $30-per-share offer for all of WBD, including CNN.
    


            That's the offer WBD is officially opposing. On Tuesday morning, WBD said it will hold a special shareholder meeting on March 20 and will recommend voting to approve the Netflix deal, which values the studio and streaming assets at $27.75 per share.
    


            WBD has argued that the sale to Netflix, along with the creation of Discovery Global, a new company housing the cable channels, is the best available option for investors, while calling the Paramount proposal overly risky and likening it to a leveraged buyout.
    


            But there is a big unknown: What is Paramount's “best and final” offer?
    


            In negotiating parlance, that's the most a buyer is willing to pay, and Paramount hasn't shared its answer.
    


            During the initial bidding war for WBD last year, Paramount indicated it was willing to pay more than $30 per share. Last week, according to WBD, a person speaking on Paramount's behalf told a Warner board member that Paramount would agree to pay $31 per share if the two sides held deal talks.
    


            The person left some additional wiggle room by indicating that $31 was not the final offer.
    


            And so, despite having a signed merger agreement, Netflix has granted WBD a limited waiver to talk with Paramount for the next seven days.
    


            “We seek your best and final proposal,” WBD said in a letter to Paramount's board on Tuesday morning.
    


            The rest of the letter, full of financial jargon and legalese, can be translated thusly: It's time to put up or shut up.
    


            Paramount made some moves in WBD's direction last week with an amended proposal that slightly sweetened the takeover terms.
    


            Holding talks with Paramount now might unlock even more cash for a company that was barely trading at $10 per share one year ago, before all the sale talk erupted.
    


            “Throughout the entire process, our sole focus has been on maximizing value and certainty for WBD shareholders,” WBD CEO David Zaslav said in a Tuesday press release.
    


            Referring to Paramount by its stock ticker symbol, he said, “Every step of the way, we have provided PSKY with clear direction on the deficiencies in their offers and opportunities to address them. We are engaging with PSKY now to determine whether they can deliver an actionable, binding proposal that provides superior value and certainty for WBD shareholders through their best and final offer.”
    


            Paramount has already filed a lawsuit over the merger battle, so WBD's latest by-the-book move might also be seen as a legal safeguard.
    


            Warner emphasized on Tuesday that its board has not determined that Paramount's proposal is “reasonably likely to result in a transaction that is superior to the Netflix merger.”
    


            But they're going to talk — so it's not entirely unlikely, either.
    


            “While we are confident that our transaction provides superior value and certainty, we recognize the ongoing distraction for WBD stockholders and the broader entertainment industry caused by PSKY's antics,” Netflix said in a statement Tuesday morning. “Accordingly, we granted WBD a narrow seven-day waiver of certain obligations under our merger agreement to allow them to engage with PSKY to fully and finally resolve this matter.”
    


            Netflix also called out “the foreign funding” supporting Paramount's bid, which comes in large part from the royal families of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi.
    


            The funding “is already raising serious national security concerns,” Netflix said, predicting close scrutiny by regulators in multiple countries.
    


            As Rich Greenfield of Lightshed Partners recently said, “the battle for Warner Bros. will make a great ‘Succession' spinoff series on Netflix” someday.

            Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has accused the Trump administration of a “continuing cover-up” in the way it has handled the release of millions of documents relating to Jeffrey Epstein.
    


            “They are slow-walking it, they are redacting the names of men who are in it, they are stonewalling legitimate requests from members of Congress,” Clinton told the BBC at this weekend's Munich Security Conference in Berlin.
    


            Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has repeatedly defended the Department of Justice's handling of the files, saying it is “committed to transparency” and “is hiding nothing.”
    


            The latest batch of documents released by the DOJ contained several references to Bill Clinton, offering fresh insights into the sometimes-lewd ways the former president's staff communicated with Epstein and his longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell.
    


            Hillary Clinton said she and her husband “have nothing to hide.” Bill Clinton has repeatedly denied wrongdoing related to the late sex offender. Previous document dumps revealed photos of Bill Clinton alongside Epstein and in a hot tub with someone a DOJ official described as a “victim” of Epstein's sexual abuse.
    


            Both Clintons are set to appear for closed-door depositions in the House's Epstein probe later February after months of back-and-forth. They agreed to conditions set by the House Oversight Committee chair only once the chamber was preparing for a vote to hold the couple in contempt for defying a congressional subpoena.
    


            Without referencing this tussle, Clinton said in the BBC interview that aired Tuesday the couple “are more than happy to say what we know, which is very limited and totally unrelated to their behavior or their crimes.”
    


Clintons will appear for depositions in Epstein probe, staving off contempt vote



            “I just want it to be fair, I just want everyone to be treated the same way. That's not true for my husband and me,” she added, repeating her desire to attend public hearings.
    


            “I think everybody should testify who is asked to testify,” she said.
    


            She claimed that scrutiny directed toward her and her husband was being used by the administration to “divert attention from President (Donald) Trump.”
    


            Trump, who is mentioned more than 1,000 times in the documents, eventually encouraged Republicans to vote to release the files late last year after initially resisting an effort to make them public.
    


            “I've been totally exonerated,” Trump told reporters Monday on Air Force One, adding of the Clintons, “They're getting pulled in, that's their problem. We'll have to see what happens.”
    


            Clinton referenced Attorney General Pam Bondi's testimony in front of the House Judiciary Committee last week as one example indicating the administration has “something to hide.”
    


            “(Bondi) refused to answer questions, she diverted attention away from the matters at hand, she refused to look at survivors,” Clinton said.
    


Justice Department lists hundreds of prominent people named in Epstein files in letter to Congress



            Her comments struck a similar tone to those made by her husband's spokesperson in December. The spokesperson, when calling on the DOJ to release all the files, said that “refusal to do so will confirm the widespread suspicion the Department of Justice's actions to date are not about transparency, but about insinuation.”
    


            The DOJ has been heavily criticized by Epstein victims and members of Congress over the department's inconsistent redactions of names and details in the millions of released documents.
    


            Some members of Congress who viewed unredacted versions of the documents later said that the department was protecting powerful men, prompting them to unredact additional names in the files and send Congress a list of “politically exposed persons” on Saturday.

Two new investigations have been announced in the EU into Elon Musk's social media platform X amid reports that its AI chatbot Grok produced sexualized images of real people, including children.

Grok, developed by Musk's AI venture xAI and integrated into X, has come under global scrutiny since its launch in 2023. Critics have raised concerns over extremist rhetoric, political bias, and sexually explicit features, warning that poorly moderated AI tools can expose users, particularly teenagers, to harmful content.

Ireland's Data Protection Commission opened an inquiry into X on Tuesday, stating it will examine whether the company breached EU data protection rules by allowing the creation of “non-consensual intimate and/or sexualized images.”

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez also ordered prosecutors on Tuesday to probe X, along with Meta and TikTok, over alleged “creation and dissemination of child pornography using their AI.” He concluded: “The impunity of the giants must end.”

The announcements follow a broader crackdown by European regulators on Big Tech firms, which face allegations of widespread abusive practices on online platforms, from anti-competitive conduct in digital advertising to the deliberate design of addictive features on social media.

X is also under investigation in France and the UK. Italy has issued a warning that using AI tools to create “undressed” deepfake imagery without consent could amount to serious privacy violations and criminal offenses.

xAI's Acceptable Use Policy prohibits depicting persons in a pornographic manner and the sexualization of children. However, in a recent “digital undressing” trend, users have publicly tagged the bot and commanded it to edit photos.

Researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate said Grok produced nearly three million sexualized images in less than two weeks, around 23,000 of which appeared to depict children.

X issued a statement last month saying it is committed to keeping the platform “safe” and maintains “zero tolerance” for child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content.

The US has secretly deported migrants to Cameroon, including people with no ties to the Central African nation and some who had legal protections against removal, according to multiple outlets.

A group of eight migrants arrived in Cameroon's capital, Yaounde, on Monday, weeks after it emerged that nine others had been flown there in January under what officials described as a third-country deportation program, AP reported on Monday, citing lawyers.

None of the deportees are Cameroonian citizens, and several had reportedly been granted protection orders by US immigration judges because of fears of persecution in their home countries.

Earlier on Saturday, The New York Times reported that the nine migrants were flown from Louisiana to Cameroon without knowing their destination until they were placed in handcuffs and chains on a Department of Homeland Security aircraft.

Washington has not disclosed any public arrangement with Cameroon to accept deportees from other nations, and the Cameroonian government has not commented on the arrivals.

US President Donald Trump has pursued controversial agreements with several African states to host migrants that his administration deems ineligible to remain in the US.

Last November, Eswatini confirmed receiving $5.1 million from Washington in exchange for taking in deportees who have no ties to the southern African nation. Equatorial Guinea and Rwanda have each received $7.5 million from the Trump administration to accept non-citizens removed from the US, according to Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen. South Sudan, Ghana, and Uganda have all agreed to deals to host a number of deportees.

A report released last week by Democratic staff on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said the US has spent more than $40 million through January 2026 on agreements with foreign governments to accept deportees. The report said the arrangements were reached through “opaque negotiations with little transparency to Congress or the public.” 

The African Union has warned member states to halt agreements that risk turning the continent into a “dumping zone” for arbitrary expulsions. UN human rights experts have also said the Trump administration risks violating the principles of migrant protection.

However, the Department of Homeland Security has defended the deportations as lawful and “essential to the safety of our homeland and the American people.”

As an assembly member, Mamdani backed the Stop Fakes Act. Now, the NYPD has admitted to spying online – but wielding actual power as mayor is complex

When Zohran Mamdani was a New York state assembly member, he sponsored the Stop Fakes Act, which would have prohibited law enforcement from creating fake electronic communication service accounts and collecting users' account information.

“Digital dragnet surveillance is widespread and dangerous, yet it continues to go unregulated,” Mamdani co-wrote in a 2023 City & State op-ed. “Although the NYPD claimed in a Department of Justice report to keep detailed records of its undercover accounts, the department refuses to provide any documentation of its social media surveillance policies or practices for public review.”

The Stop Fakes act failed, and the battle over the New York police department's (NYPD) use of surveillance technology has continued. Only now Mamdani is the city's mayor, and as a democratic socialist backed by an enthusiastic leftwing coalition, his every move is closely scrutinized – especially when it comes to law enforcement.

On 4 February, the NYPD disclosed that it used “internet attribution management infrastructure” from the technology company Ntrepid to “allow its personnel to safely, securely and covertly conduct investigations and detect possible criminal activity on the internet”. In other words, to create the sort of “sock puppet” online identities that Mamdani had once sought to prevent.

As mayor, Mamdani can presumably now stop the police department from using such a tool. But wielding actual power is complex. After previously using anti-police rhetoric, since launching his mayoral candidacy, Mamdandi has been more supportive of the NYPD.

So the question is: will he neglect an issue he was once passionate about or block investigators from using such technology and risk alienating the police, whose help he needs to run a city with 8.4 million residents?

“Mamdani was a strong partner in the fight against mass surveillance while an assembly member,” said Will Owen, communications director for the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (Stop), a non-profit that aims to outlaw such practices in New York. “Stop will continue to hold him accountable, and we are cautiously optimistic that he will continue that fight.”

Mamdani's office did not respond to the Guardian's requests for comment.

Around the peak of the Defund the Police movement in 2020, Mamdani posted on what was then Twitter: “We don't need an investigation to know that the NYPD is racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety. What we need is to #DefundTheNYPD.”

But after a police officer was killed in a July 2025 mass shooting in Manhattan, Mamdani, then the Democratic nominee for mayor, said police played a “critical role” in public safety.

“I am not defunding the police; I am not running to defund the police,” he said.

When asked about his Twitter post, Mamdani said he made such comments “amidst a frustration that many New Yorkers held at the murder of George Floyd”.

Once elected, Mamdani also decided to retain the police commissioner, the billionaire Jessica Tisch, and said he “admired her work cracking down on corruption in the upper echelons of the police department, driving down crime in New York City and standing up for New Yorkers in the face of authoritarianism”.

Despite that praise, the NYPD has continued to face criticism over its surveillance tactics.

In 2020, in response to concerns about the NYPD's use of facial recognition technology, drones and other surveillance devices, the city council passed the Public Oversight of Surveillance Technology (Post) Act, which requires the department to disclose the capabilities of its tools and rules, processes and safeguards to protect information collected.

Since then, the NYPD has not complied with the law, according to Stop and the Legal Aid Society.

In 2022, the New York City inspector general determined that the department had not provided enough detail to allow that office to conduct full annual audits.

The NYPD's disclosures used “boilerplate language that fails to provide sufficiently specific information about the nature of the technologies”, the inspector general stated.

The Legal Aid Society filed an open records request in 2020 with the NYPD seeking its contracts for confidential surveillance products and services. The police denied that request, claiming that the volume of the documents and the necessary redaction of confidential information made it “unduly burdensome”.

The case reached the appellate division of the state supreme court, which ruled that the department must turn over such records quarterly on a “rolling basis”.

“The NYPD made no effort to contend with the seismic shift caused by the Post Act,” the court opinion stated.

More than a year after the court order, the police department has provided less than 600 of 165,000 pages concerning such contracts, according to the Legal Aid Society, which offers free representation to low-income New Yorkers.

“The NYPD has done everything it could to prevent any sort of transparency,” said Jerome Greco, the organization's digital forensic director. “At the current pace, it will take decades to receive the estimated 165,000 pages.”

In a separate report published earlier this month, as mandated by the Post Act, the department disclosed its use of Ntrepid.

The company has offered so-called “sock puppet” software that creates fake online identities. In 2011, the Guardian reported that the US military worked with Ntrepid to manipulate social media sites by using fake online personas to influence internet conversations and spread pro-American propaganda.

Greco is concerned about the NYPD hiring Ntrepid because the department stated that it uses such tools for “legitimate law enforcement purposes or other official business”.

“There is a real question about what other official business the NYPD could be using fake online accounts for that don't relate to legitimate law enforcement purposes,” Greco said.

Ntrepid's AI agents allow “police departments to collect, analyze, and infer much more information much more quickly than having an individual officer sit and review social media posts”, said Emile Ayoub, senior counsel in the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program. “The increased scope and speed of surveillance that these tools offer undermines the central aim of the fourth amendment, which as the supreme court recognized was ‘to place obstacles in the way of a too permeating police surveillance'.”

Owen, of Stop, also argues that the police could use such a tool to target Black and Latino residents. He pointed to the NYPD's previous disclosure that if someone “makes a comment such as ‘Happy Birthday' on the Facebook page of a gang member”, they could be considered a “known associate” and added to its criminal database, according to an inspector general report.

“This technology is highly biased and racist in how it flags New Yorkers on social media and how it flags supposedly suspicious content,” Owen said.

The NYPD and Ntrepid did not respond to requests for comment.

Even if Mamdani does not address the NYPD's use of Ntrepid, state lawmakers could. A group of Democrats have again proposed the Stop Fakes bill.

Despite their concerns, Owen and Greco appear to be giving Mamdani the benefit of the doubt – for now.

“We are aware that the mayor's administration is still pretty new, and he has a lot on his plate,” Greco said. Given his sponsorship of the Stop Fakes bill, “we are hoping that he will continue to support that position”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Trump says everyday Americans deserve a chance to buy higher-risk ‘alternative' investments. Critics say this could lead to big losses for small investors

On a summer day in 2018, Cathy Shubert, then 58, hopped in her Toyota Rav 4 and drove to the Jacksonville, Florida, office of Mario Payne, an investment adviser at the financial services firm Raymond James. She had a lot on her mind. She was not happy with her job at a local bank branch and wanted to see if Payne thought she had saved enough to retire.

“He said what I was retiring with would carry me and everything would be wonderful,” she remembered. “I went home and told my husband, ‘Oh my God, I want you to go meet him.'”

After giving notice she would be leaving her job, Shubert said, she signed the back of her retirement check and handed more than $250,000 over to Payne, who over time put her 401(k) savings into “structured notes”, “leveraged ETFs” and other risky products usually intended for wealthy, sophisticated investors.

By 2024, her attorney said, many of these investments had tanked. More than half of her money was gone.

These are perilous times for small investors like Shubert. Wall Street firms seeking to boost their share of the $48tn in US retirement accounts are salivating at the prospect of selling even more high-risk “alternative investments” to so-called “mom and pop” investors. Retirement accounts are a “pot of gold that all sorts of industry players want to get their hands on”, said Barbara Roper, a former senior adviser at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The potential for big losses and the high fees associated with alternative products can wreck the financial hopes of inexperienced investors with modest amounts of money to put in play, according to former regulators, securities fraud lawyers and investors themselves.

And a growing number of small investors may be at risk in the months and the years to come – thanks to a push by the financial industry, federal lawmakers and the Trump administration to loosen protections for small investors.

In August, Donald Trump issued an executive order that promised his administration will make it easier for Americans to stash cutting-edge investments in their retirement accounts. The order – titled “Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors” – touts “the potential growth and diversification opportunities associated with alternative asset investments”. Americans had $13.9tn in 401(k)s and other employer-based retirement plans at the end of September 2025.

Three months later, Trump commuted the prison sentence of the former GPB Capital Holdings CEO David Gentile, who was found guilty in 2024 for his role in a years-long scheme that involved alternative investments. Investor advocates criticized Trump for freeing Gentile, who was at the center of the $1.6bn fraud that harmed thousands of teachers, nurses and other less experienced investors.

“It's a signal that it is not a priority to protect your mom and pop investors,” said Adam Gana, a lawyer at the Chicago firm Gana Weinstein who has represented hundreds of clients who lost money in private equity deals set up by GPB. “It's unbelievable. People's lives were ruined, ruined by their investments in GPB.”

The White House did not provide detailed answers to questions from the Guardian about the Gentile case or Trump's efforts to open up alternative investments to more Americans.

In an emailed statement, a White House spokesperson said: “The Trump administration is committed to expanding optionality for retail investors. All Americans are, of course, encouraged to appropriately weigh the risks that come with any investment decision, including for traditional equity and debt securities.”

The weakening of protections for small investors and the push to sell them riskier products come at a time when many Americans are worried about inflation and the high cost of living. Buffeted by soaring prices for everything from groceries to electricity, 92% of US retirees fear their assets are being eaten away, according to a survey by the asset manager Schroders. In a poll of 401(k) plan participants by the financial services giant Charles Schwab, 57% cited inflation as a top obstacle to reaching a comfortable retirement.

These concerns can leave small investors vulnerable to come-ons for products that promise high yields and protection from inflation.

“A new inflation hedge has arrived,” boasts MarketX Ventures, which describes itself on its website as a “one-stop shop” for high-growth private tech investment opportunities. It suggests investors diversify into private markets “like the super-rich do”. MarketX's CEO, Cathryn Chen, said in an email that most of her firm's clients were sophisticated, tech-savvy investors, and that less sophisticated investors were given “extra help” and “extra resources” to help them understand her firm's investments and their risks.

Alternative investments – often called “alts” in industry shorthand – include an array of products that don't fall into the plain vanilla categories of stocks, bonds or money markets. Among the most aggressively marketed alts are private placements, which receive less scrutiny from securities regulators and lack the disclosure requirements about risks and financial results that are required for stocks and bonds. Other higher-risk alts include promissory notes, structured products and cryptocurrencies.

At the SEC, officials are all-in on Trump's executive order. In remarks to the agency's investor advisory committee in September, the SEC chairman, Paul S Atkins, said he was “delighted” by Trump's order to increase small investor access to alternative assets.

Yet securities regulators know that rules meant to protect investors already are being broken when advisers pitch alts. In 2022, the SEC's division of examinations issued a risk alert after examining registered investment advisers that manage private funds, flagging problems that included misleading performance and marketing disclosures and failing to conduct reasonable investigations of the investments they were selling.

A 2025 study by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (Finra) showed the public lacks basic understanding of markets – an ominous state of affairs at a time when risky alt products are proliferating. When Finra gave an 11-question financial knowledge quiz to 2,861 investors, the average score was 5.3 – just under 50%. To see if investors could recognize warning signs of a fraudulent investment, Finra asked if they would invest in a product “that promises a guaranteed, risk-free 25% annual return every year for the next 5 years”. Half of the investors said they would.

Michael Bixby, a Florida securities lawyer who represents Shubert and more than 100 other people in two lawsuits tied to Payne's alleged misconduct, said the complexity and murkiness of alts makes it nearly impossible for small investors to understand what they're getting into. When the Guardian asked the lawyer how many of his clients understood the investments they had purchased on Payne's advice, Bixby answered with a precise number.

“None,” he said. “On the structured products, I can barely understand it.”

The Guardian reached Payne by phone, but he hung up after he was asked if he would discuss the questions about investor losses that a reporter had sent him. His regulatory records show that he continues to be licensed with the SEC as a registered investment adviser.

Payne is not named as a defendant in Finra arbitration claims and lawsuits that Bixby has filed against Raymond James, the financial firm where Payne previously worked. But the lawsuits include descriptions of alleged misconduct by Payne during his time at Raymond James and after he was fired by the firm – claiming he misled small investors by telling them that high-risk investments were “safe” and “guaranteed”.

The two suits, filed in state court in Florida, claim Raymond James failed to notify the SEC and Finra about Payne's alleged misconduct, depriving Shubert and other investors of information that could have warned them away from working with him. Raymond James told regulators his termination was related to “failure to meet performance expectations” and not his sales practices, according to Finra records.

Spokespeople and lawyers for Raymond James did not respond to requests for comment from the Guardian. In court filings, Raymond James said it was “misleading” for the plaintiffs to say that it had not properly supervised Payne or that the investments he bought for them were not in their best interests. The company has asked that both cases be dismissed, arguing that the plaintiffs failed to file their suits in a timely manner and that many of them didn't become Payne's clients until after he was fired from Raymond James.

Bixby said Shubert lost money in structured notes while Payne was at Raymond James, but most of her losses with Payne came after he left the firm.

Shubert said she wasn't familiar with the kinds of investments Payne put her in. She tried to read a prospectus associated with one of her investments, but didn't make it through to the end. “There is a lot of stuff in those and, to be honest with you, I didn't understand all that,” she recalled. “I thought ‘It's his job – he knows what he's doing.'”

She is grateful to have another source of income from a family member, but said it was still a significant hit, financially and emotionally. Many nights, she said, she lay in bed asking herself: “Oh my God, I only have this much money left – how many years will this last me?”

Along with the risks of slippery salesmanship and big losses, many alternative assets also carry high fees that can eat into even positive investment gains.

And less regulated “alt” investment deals often carry greater risks for losses and fraud, according to studies led by Craig McCann, an economist and securities expert.

In so-called “Regulation D” offerings, by private companies, hedge funds, private equity funds and others, investors typically pay upfront fees including sales commissions and acquisition costs, according to a 2023 research paper by McCann'sconsulting firm, SLCG. These costs, the paper said, reduce returns and create “perverse incentives and conflicts of interest” between investors and the industry players who are creating, managing and selling investment deals.

In a separate study in 2015, McCann's firm looked at publicly traded REITs – real-estate investment trusts – and alternative REITs that are traded privately. This research found that annual investor returns from private REITs averaged 6.3%, compared with 11.6% in the Vanguard REIT Index Fund of traded REITs. More than half of non-traded REITs' underperformance was due to upfront fees that are mostly pocketed by salespeople, the study said.

Fees can also cut into the returns for private placements, which use financial advisers and others to market company shares directly to investors rather than through public offerings traded on stock exchanges.

Kristian Kraszewski, a Massachusetts securities lawyer, filed an arbitration claim against the brokerage firm Concorde Investment Services in February 2025 alleging that his client was “promised steady returns” from Passco Palm Desert LLC, which offered private investments in residential apartment complexes. His client lost $125,000 of the $132,000 he put in, Kraszewski said in the claim, which he filed with Finra, but the broker made 6% on the sale.

Concorde said in an emailed statement that it couldn't comment on the arbitration, which is pending. But it said that its offering documents “clearly disclosed” that the investment, which was offered in 2019, “involved substantial risk”, adding that real estate projects nationwide were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, market disruptions and interest-rate increases.

The company said it “conducts rigorous due diligence” and that it was continually enhancing its systems, training and oversight.

According to a 2019 private placement document reviewed by the Guardian, 13.4% of Passco's $25m offering was expected to go to brokerage fees and other expenses. Executives at Passco did not respond to emails and a phone message from the Guardian.

These days, Kathleen McCauley won't even indulge in a coffee at Dunkin'. At 69, she mows her own lawn and strains to come up with ideas for no-cost outings when she gets a day with her three grandsons. Her nightmare scenario: that social security might not exist in 10 years.

“I feel like I'm in a financial prison,” she told the Guardian.

It is not the life she had expected after squirreling away $600,000, which she had saved up in the jobs she had worked after finishing high school – delivering Pepperidge Farm cookies and Edy's ice cream to stores and later doing retail sales for Verizon Wireless.

In 2022, McCauley said, she started to think about “how old I was” and realized she needed to “beef up” her 401(k). So she entrusted $450,000 to Vincent Camarda, a financial adviser in Massapequa, New York.

She said Camarda “made it seem like there was no risk” when he suggested she invest in a private equity fund called Windsor Capital Fund. She remembers the chilly fall day when she sat in his office going over her assets and expenses.

“He said: ‘How would you feel if I told you that you could retire right now?'” she recalled. “I felt my eyes welling up with tears.”

Two weeks later, she returned to sign the paperwork – a half-inch stack of documents sprinkled with “sign here” tabs. “I wasn't really given an opportunity to read any of it,” she said.

One of those tabs was attached to Windsor's Private Placement Memorandum, which said she would qualify to invest only if she was an “accredited investor” – a term of art that describes the supposedly sophisticated investors who have a net worth of $1m or $200,000 in annual income. With $600,000 in savings and a modest income, she didn't come close to qualifying, according to a lawsuit McCauley filed against Camarda and others in 2024 in federal court in Brooklyn.

“I couldn't even tell you what an accredited investor is,” McCauley said.

The fund began to default on its monthly payments to her in early 2024, but when she demanded her money back, Camarda refused to return her savings, her lawsuit alleges. The suit accuses Camarda and other defendants of fraud, breach of contract and “unjust enrichment”. In an answer to McCauley's suit, the defendants denied the allegations, including McCauley's claim that Camarda said she had enough money to retire.

Neither Camarda nor his lawyers responded to requests for comment.

McCauley and Shubert are not alone in finding their lives changed after being persuaded to invest retirement savings in alternative financial assets.

One Florida retiree, 66, told the Guardian she started visiting local food banks after losing more than $200,000 at the hands of a broker who put her retirement money in structured notes. “It's so hard,” she said. “Friends say ‘Let's go out to eat.' I say ‘I'm not hungry,' or ‘I already ate.' I've never lived like this.”

An 85-year-old Long Island investor said she lost more than $500,000 in promissory notes that were supposed to yield 12% interest. Her money is gone. “I'm in debt over my head and I just signed up with National Debt Relief,” she said.

A 64-year old Florida woman said she lost “almost everything” after investing more than $500,000 in leveraged ETFs and structured notes.

“It's very gut-wrenching,” she said. “We don't go on trips, we don't do anything. I should be enjoying this part of my life and I'm not.”

In the GPB case, lawyers for the company's CEO, Gentile, argued there was no proof investors lost money as a result of the frauds he was convicted of committing – and that shareholders in a private equity fund at the heart of the case were sophisticated investors.

“You had to be rich to invest in this fund,” one of Gentile's attorneys said during the trial.

The government's attorneys pushed back.

“The victims of the defendant's crimes are hardworking everyday people,” prosecutors said in a sentencing memo. “They include small business owners, farmers, a retired electrician who served in the Vietnam war, teachers and nurses.”

Among them is a married couple who said they raised three children and saved their retirement nest egg by sharecropping, waiting tables and running an auto repair and towing business. “All of the literal blood, sweat and tears we shed to work hard and be successful was taken from us,” one of the spouses wrote in a victim statement.

Another investor wrote: “I was bilked out of $25,000, which may not seem like a lot to some, but at my age it will be very difficult to save up that sum of money again. My wife and I made many sacrifices to save $25,000.”

In a separate lawsuit, New York state authorities alleged that investors' funds were used to cover the costs of private jets, Gentile's 50th birthday party and a $355,000 Ferrari FF driven by Gentile.

Gentile denied the allegations against him. A Trump spokesperson blamed the executive's conviction on the “weaponization of justice” by the Biden administration. Gentile's attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.

Trump's clemency order freed the executive from prison after he had served 12 days of a seven-year sentence – and wiped away any requirement that he pay restitution to the victims.

On Thanksgiving, Trump's pardon czar, Alice Marie Johnson, said on social media that she was “deeply grateful to see David Gentile heading home to his young children”, calling his release an example of “the extraordinary power of second chances”.

There have been protections in place for nearly a century that seek to rein in abusive practices in the marketplace for private securities and other alternative investments.

In the wake of the Wall Street crash of 1929, the federal government passed laws to establish new standards for companies that wished to sell securities to the public. Under the new laws, companies that had large numbers of shareholders and were traded on stock exchanges had to provide detailed information about their risks and finances and issue regular reports. Companies not traded on public stock exchanges were required to provide far less information.

Over time, the SEC has offered more and more exemptions to allow companies to avoid disclosure requirements. In 1982, it issued Regulation D, which expanded the number of companies that could sell private securities and widened the universe of investors who could buy them, designating investors with a net worth of $1m or $200,000 in annual income as “accredited investors”.

In 2012, the Jobs Act further loosened restrictions, increasing the number of shareholders a company had to have before being forced to go public and allowing issuers to pitch their private offerings to more investors.

Roper, the former SEC adviser, said the idea that investors in this financial category don't need protection of federal securities laws is a fiction. “Most accredited investors lack the market power to demand access to information” and “lack the financial sophistication to value those securities”, she said.

Today's deregulatory momentum seeks to tear down even more of the modest safeguards that limit advisers' ability to sell alternative investments.

In December, the House of Representatives passed the Invest Act, a sweeping document that would expand the number of companies that can offer shares without providing audited financial statements, reduce regulations and generally make alternative investments more available to the public.

The proposed legislation complements Trump's August executive order, which asserted that “regulatory overreach” and “lawsuits filed by opportunistic trial lawyers” had stifled innovation and prevented Americans' 401(k) retirement accounts from “achieving the competitive returns and asset diversification necessary to secure a dignified, comfortable retirement”.

Atkins, the SEC chair, said in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal in December that the market's most fundamental purpose was “placing American might in the hands of citizens instead of the regulatory state”. While he endorses the idea of making private markets more accessible to everyday investors, Atkins has frequently said that protections are necessary.

An SEC spokesperson did not respond to detailed questions, but referred the Guardian to a statement by Atkins in September that the markets would need “appropriate guardrails” that “address the important issues and potential pitfalls inherent to this genre of investments”.

Amid these shifts, experts expect sales of alternative investments to the public will soar. The Deloitte Center for Financial Services has projected that retail investors' allocations to private investments will grow from $80bn to $2.4tn by 2030.

Investor advocates worry this growing wave of smaller investors will enjoy fewer of the upsides – and more of the downsides – from alternative investments than sophisticated players.

“If you have a really good investment opportunity and need to raise money, you are probably not going to try to sell to every random truck driver,” said Benjamin Edwards, an associate dean at University of Nevada Las Vegas and expert on corporate governance and consumer protection. “So the firms that are offering these investments to retail investors probably can't find anyone else to buy it.”

Along with the challenges of understanding complex investments, experts say, mom and pop investors usually don't have the background to evaluate the firms and advisers that are peddling these deals.

McCauley's lawsuit says she was not aware when she met her adviser, Camarda, that he had already been sued by the SEC for selling the fraudulent securities of Par Funding, a lending company whose CEO was sentenced to 186 months in prison in March for securities fraud and other crimes. The SEC said in its complaint that, in exchange for Par paying down debt that Camarda's company had taken on, Camarda would solicit investors to buy Par's securities. In court papers, Camarda and his co-defendants denied that charge and denied that they had failed to disclose conflicts of interest to investors. The trial is scheduled for August.

Timothy J Dennin, McCauley's attorney, said everyday investors tend to trust persuasive salespeople who have the trappings of success. “They are either uninclined to investigate such a person or unaware of the tools out there that may raise red flags.”

For investors like McCauley and Shubert, it has never been easy to seek justice – and the obstacles are likely to multiply in the months and years ahead.

Financial firms will not open an account unless a customer agrees in writing to give up the right to sue, which means that investors who lose money in alts must seek justice through Finra arbitration, where hearings take place behind closed doors and litigation documents are not public.

Small investors seeking restitution after losing $50,000 or less in alts often face significant hurdles, according to Nicholas J Guiliano, a lawyer who represents investors in arbitration. It is “exceedingly difficult” to find lawyers for small cases, he said, and investors who press a case in the Finra forum on their own “never fare well” compared with those who have lawyers. On its website, Finra lists arbitration clinics that sometimes are able to represent investors who can't afford lawyers.

Big investors with access to the best lawyers, though, have had recent success in holding financial firms to account – and Wall Street has fought back. Arbitrators at Finra awarded $132m last year to a wealthy family that said it lost $19.5m in alts at the hands of Chuck A Roberts, a former adviser at the financial services firm Stifel Nicolaus.

During hearings in 2024, the investors' lawyer presented a text in which Roberts assured one of the family members: “You send me the $15MM, I will double the whole ball of wax in less than 5 years.”

In another text, the adviser boasted to a colleague that he had just pitched a different customer to buy structured notes. The customer “gladly did this round of notes”, he wrote, adding: “I'm calling and chiseling every motherf**ker.” Roberts's lawyer, Susan Schroeder, declined to comment on his behalf.

Roberts, who has 23 pending customer disputes on his Finra record, was barred from the securities industry in July, after telling Finra that he would not continue to testify in a review of the arbitration complaints against Stifel that revolved around his behavior. Stifel did not respond to a request for comment.

The big award didn't sit well with lawyers at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (Sifma), Wall Street's lobbying group. Referring to “recent extreme outlier punitive damages awards”, Sifma has pressed Finra to make its arbitration process less friendly to investors – urging it to help rein in punitive damages awards, make it easier to dismiss investors' arbitration claims and allow financial firms to take “high dollar” disputes to other arbitration forums, which lack Finra's systems that police unpaid awards.

Sifma did not respond to a request for comment.

In an emailed statement, Richard Berry, an executive vice-president at Finra, said the organization “strives to provide a fair, efficient and effective arbitration forum for all participants”.

In his executive order, Trump's bid for putting more 401(k) money into alts is paired with a call to make it harder for investors to pursue compensation for wrongdoing by employers, advisers and other players that control those plans.

Both Trump and Atkins, the SEC chair, have described their quests to open alternative investments to everyday investors as righting a wrong. In their view, retail investors have been denied the opportunity that wealthier people have to invest in these securities.

This effort comes as the SEC's strongest voice for investor protection has been sidelined. In December, the Senate banking committee declined to move forward with the reappointment of the SEC commissioner Caroline Crenshaw.

With the departure of Crenshaw, the lone Democrat on the agency's governing board, the commission now has a 3-0 Republican lineup – producing what the financial reform group Better Markets calls “a one-party echo chamber” that “lacks a commissioner who is willing to stand up to the financial industry”.

Crenshaw had railed against the latest deregulatory efforts – pointing out that private markets were specifically designed for wealthier, more knowledgeable investors because of their high risk, limited information and hidden fees.

In December – in her last speech as an SEC commissioner – Crenshaw said the financial regulatory environment now resembles “the period prior to the stock market crash in 1929”.

Opening private markets to more mom and pop investors, she predicted, “will come back to bite regulators – but not before Main Street Americans' savings have been looted”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Follow latest updates as public figures praise civil rights leader who was a protege of Martin Luther King Jr and twice ran for Democratic presidential nomination

Jesse Jackson, civil rights leader, dies aged 84

Jesse Jackson – a life in pictures

US political leaders pay tribute to Jesse Jackson

Former vice-president Kamala Harris has also paid tribute to Jesse Jackson, describing him as “one of America's greatest patriots”.

“He spent his life summoning all of us to fulfil the promise of America and building the coalitions to make that promise real,” she wrote in a post on X, adding that he gave a voice to those who were “removed from power and politics”.

She continued:

He let us know our voices mattered. He instilled in us that we were somebody. And he widened the path for generations to follow in his footsteps and lead. As a young law student, I would drive back and forth from Oakland, where I lived, to San Francisco, where I went to school. I had a bumper sticker in the back window of my car that read: “Jesse Jackson for President.” 

As I would drive across the Bay Bridge, you would not believe how people from every walk of life would give me a thumbs up or honk of support. They were small interactions, but they exemplified Reverend Jackson's life work – lifting up the dignity of working people, building community and coalitions, and strengthening our democracy and nation. 

I was proud to partner with and learn from him on this work throughout my career, and I am so grateful for the time we spent together this January. Reverend Jackson was a selfless leader, mentor, and friend to me and so many others.

Bishop William J Barber II, who co-founded the Poor People's Campaign, recalled Jackson's hope for America's promise as he paid tribute to the late civil rights activist.

“Jesse Jackson was a gift from God and a witness that God exists in the ways he cared for and lifted all people, the way he called forth a rainbow coalition of people to challenge economic and social inequality from the pulpit to a historic presidential run, the way he dared to keep hope alive whenever the nation struggled with being who she says she is and yet ought to be,” said Barber.

He added:

When I was a college student, he was a gift to me as a mentor, and it has been my great privilege to have him walk alongside me through my whole public ministry.

May we all take up his hope for the America that has never yet been but nevertheless must be.

Jackson, who first travelled to South Africa in July 1979, just after Steve Biko's passing, vigorously advocated for American sanctions on the apartheid regime and supported Nelson Mandela's anti-apartheid struggle.

“His campaigns for an end to apartheid included disinvestment from the apartheid economy and challenging the support the regime enjoyed in certain circles and institutions internationally,” President Cyril Ramaphosa said.

“We are deeply indebted to the energy, principled clarity and personal risk with which he supported our struggle and campaigned for freedom and equality in other parts of the world.”

Jackson's impact “can be felt in virtually every aspect of American life,” said Kristen Clarke, a former Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, US Department of Justice during the Joe Biden administration.

“A tireless and extraordinary public servant, his charge to all of us was to stay hopeful, keep up the good fight and respect the dignity and humanity of all people,” Clarke said in a statement on Tuesday.

“Jackson has been, and will always be, a central part of the story regarding America's ongoing quest for justice and equality.”

During Black History Month in the early 1970s, Jesse Jackson, the civil rights icon who died Tuesday, appeared on the set of the public television show, Sesame Street. Reciting the poem “I Am Somebody”, which was meant to bolster the self esteem of underserved children in urban environments, Jackson led a group of multiracial children on the show in a call and response:

“I am somebody. I am somebody. I may be poor, but I am somebody. I may be young, but I am somebody. I may be on welfare, but I am somebody. I may be small, but I am somebody. I may have made mistakes, but I am somebody. My clothes are different, my face is different, my hair is different, but I am somebody. I am Black, brown, white, I speak a different language, but I must be respected, protected, never rejected. I am God's child. I am somebody.”

Jackson's version of the 1940s poem, originally written by Atlanta minister and civil rights leader Reverend Dr. William Holmes Borders, would become a popular refrain in Black households after its airing on Sesame Street that year.

“I Am Somebody” also served as a rallying call for Jackson throughout his life. In August 2021, he chanted the words with protesters as he advocated for voting rights outside of the US Capitol.

Political leaders have celebrated Jesse Jackson as a “titan” of the civil rights movement after the announcement on Tuesday of his death at the age of 84.

Al Sharpton, the veteran civil rights campaigner who Jackson worked closely with after the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr, called his friend and mentor “a consequential and transformative leader who changed this nation and the world”.

In a social media post on Tuesday, Sharpton wrote: “He shaped public policy and changed laws. He kept the dream alive and taught young children from broken homes, like me, that we don't have broken spirits.”

Senior Democrats, the party for which Jackson campaigned twice as a presidential candidate, in 1984 and 1988, were also quick to pay tribute.

Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign, praised Jackson for embodying “courage, hope, and a relentlessness that will not be denied.”

“His historic presidential campaigns paved the way for generations of Black leaders to imagine ourselves in rooms we were once told were closed to us,” Robinson said in a statement.

“Reverend Jackson also stood up when it mattered; when it wasn't easy and when it wasn't popular. His support for marriage equality and for LGBTQ+ people affirmed a simple, powerful truth: Our liberation is bound together.”

The veteran civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, who has died aged 84, made history when he stood for the White House in 1984 and 1988. He was not the first African American to seek the US presidency, but he was the first to mount a serious challenge, breaking through racial barriers, securing millions of votes and, at one point, becoming frontrunner for the Democratic nomination.

His run opened the way for Barack Obama two decades later. But Jackson deserves to be remembered as more than a footnote in Obama's biography. It took courage and self-confidence to stand in the 1980s, with memories of segregation and the civil rights battles of the 60s still raw.

In the middle of the 1984 presidential run, the writer James Baldwin offered what today still stands as a fitting epitaph. The writer told reporters that the presence of an African-American civil rights activist in the race had been a significant moment.

Jackson's presence “presents the American Republic with questions and choices it has spent all its history until this hour trying to avoid ... And nothing will ever again be what it was before.” The quote came from Marshall Frady's sympathetic biography, Jesse: The Life and Pilgrimage of Jesse Jackson, published in 1996.

“Jackson was more than a civil rights advocate – he was a living bridge between generations, carrying forward the unfinished work and sacred promise of the Civil Rights Movement,” Martin Luther King III and his wife Andrea King said in a statement.

The pair added:

He walked with courage when the road was uncertain, spoke with conviction when the truth was inconvenient, and stood with the poor, the marginalized, and the forgotten when it was not popular to do so.

His life was a testament to the power of faith in action – faith that justice could be won, that dignity belongs to every person, and that love must always have the final word.

May his memory be a wellspring of strength and courage for all who continue the sacred work to which he gave his life. As he so often reminded us: keep hope alive.

A statement on behalf of National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) chairman, Leon W Russell, vice-chair, Karen Boykin Towns and the organisation's president, Derrick Johnson paid tribute to Jackson today.

It read:

Reverend Jesse Jackson was not only a civil rights icon - he was family to the NAACP. His work advanced black America at every turn. He challenged this nation to live up to its highest ideals, and he reminded our movement that hope is both a strategy and a responsibility.

His historic run for president inspired millions and brought race to the forefront of American politics.

We honor his legacy by continuing the work he championed: protecting the right to vote, expanding economic opportunity, and fighting for the freedom and dignity of black people everywhere.

The mayor of Atlanta said in a statement that he intends to keep Jackson's hopes alive, as he paid tribute to the late civil rights activist.

“I join the people of Atlanta mourning the passing of an American icon,” mayor Andre Dickens said.

“Rev Jackson showed up for us consistently. He never stopped challenging leaders to do better by Americans, especially when it comes to economic justice. And that's a fight that we will continue.

“Here in Atlanta, as well as around the country, we would be wise to heed Rev. Jackson's words and ‘keep hope alive.' We intend to.”

Senator Elizabeth Warren said Jesse Jackson was a “trailblazer and a fighter” in an X post today.

She said:

I had the privilege of speaking with him about his vision for a fairer, more equal and just country.

He has given a generation of leaders hope that we can and should keep fighting for that vision.

He will be missed.

Here is a video obituary, detailing the remarkable life of the civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, who died today:

Minority leader of the Senate Chuck Schumer has called Jesse Jackson an “icon” and “fearless warrior” for justice.

In a post on X, he said:

Jesse Jackson was an icon of the civil rights movement and a fearless warrior for justice for all people. He was one of the most powerful forces for positive change in our country and our world. America is a more equal and just place thanks to his work.

My prayers are with his family and all of those who were inspired by him. As we honor Rev. Jackson in the coming days, I will be thinking of the many lessons he taught us: “Never look down on anybody unless you're helping them up.” We should all seek to embody that spirit and serve others the way Rev. Jackson did.

Keep hope—alive!

By the early 1980s, the Democratic party was facing a crossroads. The 1980 landslide election of Ronald Reagan, who clenched the presidency with a whopping 489 electoral college votes against Democratic incumbent Jimmy Carter, swiftly pulled the Democratic party to the right in the political and cultural wave of the “Reagan Revolution”.

For those Democratic constituents left behind, however, a challenge was mounting, mostly within US industrial cities whose economies were ransacked by Reagan's “trickle-down” economics. Record tax cuts for the wealthy had come at the expense of a contracted social safety net, thus exacerbating inequality and collapsing much of the working class into the poor.

Grassroots resistance campaigns spawned across the country in response to this dire urban crisis that had disproportionately devastated African Americans, and between 1982 and 1984 they had registered 2 million new Black voters – the largest gain in registered Black voters since the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

These hands-on voter registration drives were orchestrated much in part by Rev Jesse Jackson, the nationally known civil rights activist who died on Tuesday. Jackson had cut his teeth as one of Martin Luther King Jr's youngest and most charismatic lieutenants in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and throughout the civil rights movement.

By the 1970s, in the wake of King's assassination, Jackson had transferred the movement's master-classes in strategic organizing into founding Operation Push, a populist leftist offshoot of the SCLC that coalesced progressive whites, LGBTQ+ communities, environmentalists, Asian Americans, Indigenous Nations, Latinos, anti-war activists, and labor unions.

Jackson led discussions with leadership across the country about the prospect for a national Black-backed progressive movement that could map a viable path to a Democratic nomination for president.

Former president Joe Biden has paid tribute to Jesse Jackson and said the civil rights activist was “determined and tenacious” in his belief in America's promise.

He said the late civil rights activist was a man of God, as well as a man of the people and that he was “unafraid to work to redeem the soul of our nation”.

In a statement on social media, Biden said:

I've seen how Reverend Jackson has helped lead our Nation forward through tumult and triumph. He's done it with optimism, and a relentless insistence on what is right and just. Whether through impassioned words on the campaign trail, or moments of quiet courage, Reverend Jackson influenced generations of Americans, and countless elected leaders, including Presidents.

Reverend Jackson believed in his bones the promise of America: that we are all created equal in the image of God and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. While we've never fully lived up to that promise, he dedicated his life to ensuring we never fully walked away from it either.

Jill and I are grateful to Reverend Jackson for his lifetime of dedicated service and inspirational leadership. We extend our love to the entire Jackson family, the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, and all those who counted Reverend Jackson as a mentor, friend, and hero.

Govenor JB Pritzker has ordered flags to half-staff across Illinois in honor of Jesse Jackson.

Pritzker, a Democrat, called Jackson a “giant of the civil rights movement.”

“He broke down barriers, inspired generations, and kept hope alive,” Pritzker said in social media posts.

“Our state, nation, and world are better due to his years of service.”

Chairman of the Democrats Ken Martin described Jesse Jackson as “a tireless champion for justice, equality, and human dignity”.

In a post on X, he said:

We mourn the passing of civil rights legend Jesse Jackson, a tireless champion for justice, equality, and human dignity.

Rev. Jackson's lifelong fight for civil rights helped shape a more just America, and his historic 1988 campaign for President broke barriers and inspired millions.

May his legacy continue to guide us forward.

California representative Ro Khanna said Jesse Jackson was a “giant of our times” as he paid tribute to the civil rights activist.

“Reverend Jackson spoke for all those who the powerful do not see. He inspired us to build a rainbow coalition,” he wrote on X.

“His 1988 Convention speech is one of the greatest in our nation's history. He was a giant of our times.”

Former vice-president Kamala Harris has also paid tribute to Jesse Jackson, describing him as “one of America's greatest patriots”.

“He spent his life summoning all of us to fulfil the promise of America and building the coalitions to make that promise real,” she wrote in a post on X, adding that he gave a voice to those who were “removed from power and politics”.

She continued:

He let us know our voices mattered. He instilled in us that we were somebody. And he widened the path for generations to follow in his footsteps and lead. As a young law student, I would drive back and forth from Oakland, where I lived, to San Francisco, where I went to school. I had a bumper sticker in the back window of my car that read: “Jesse Jackson for President.” 

As I would drive across the Bay Bridge, you would not believe how people from every walk of life would give me a thumbs up or honk of support. They were small interactions, but they exemplified Reverend Jackson's life work – lifting up the dignity of working people, building community and coalitions, and strengthening our democracy and nation. 

I was proud to partner with and learn from him on this work throughout my career, and I am so grateful for the time we spent together this January. Reverend Jackson was a selfless leader, mentor, and friend to me and so many others.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Liubov Tsybulska

Founder and current director of NGO ""Join Ukraine,""

When Russia announced a ""partial"" mobilization in the fall of 2022, its society experienced a genuine shock.

The queues at the Upper Lars border crossing into Georgia and the chaotic roundups of reservists are still fresh in public memory. The Russian authorities learned from that episode and shifted tactics toward a more concealed form of mobilization.

Several tools were deployed at once: mass recruitment from prisons, sending convicts to the front in exchange for pardons, and aggressive enlistment of ""volunteers"" through generous financial incentives — large signing bonuses, debt write-offs, promises of high salaries and a ""better life,"" albeit often a short one.

This approach worked pretty well. Despite brutal ""meat-grinder assault"" tactics and heavy casualties, Russia's war machine managed to recruit at least as many people as it lost on the battlefield.

Between 2023 and 2025, Russia recruited more than 400,000 people annually for the war against Ukraine. That number has been sufficient to sustain offensive operations, even if not enough to give the Kremlin the decisive advantage needed for rapid advances and large-scale occupation.

If Moscow wants to maintain its current pace of offensive operations, it will need roughly the same number of recruits in 2026. Fewer volunteers would force a reduction in assault intensity. More would allow the army to continue fighting with little regard for casualties.

The short answer is yes. Russia can announce another ""partial"" mobilization — selective, random, semi-coercive, whatever term it chooses — and pull hundreds of thousands into the army in a relatively short period.

Over the past four years, the state has prepared for this. New laws have made draft evasion far more difficult, penalties have increased, and digital registries of conscripts have been tightened. Police will not need to chase reservists: draft notices can now be issued electronically, and attempts to avoid them may lead to prison sentences — from which many will ultimately still be sent to war.

So yes, Russia has the capacity to mobilize people for continued aggression.

But the broader answer is more complex. The Kremlin will try to avoid an open mobilization. The lessons of fall 2022 were learned. Even an otherwise passive society experienced shock, and the political risks for the regime were real. A new mobilization might be technically smoother thanks to updated laws and better preparation, but Moscow still prefers not to risk it.

After all, why announce mobilization when, for four years, state propaganda has insisted that Russia is winning and that Ukrainian forces and ""foreign mercenaries"" are on the verge of collapse? As long as the war remains something seen on television, Russians will continue to support it and avoid openly challenging the regime.

Moreover, participation in the war has become part of a revised social contract: it is acceptable — even encouraged — if it is well paid. Few mourn these ""volunteers."" There is a tacit understanding that they went to war for money and must bear responsibility for their choice.

Anyone who has spent time on Russian social media over the past three years (hopefully for research purposes) has seen the flood of contract recruitment ads. They are everywhere: banners, targeted posts, regional groups, federal channels. The message is simple: sign a contract with the Russian army.

The offer is generous. Millions of rubles as a signing bonus, additional payments, high monthly salaries, debt forgiveness, and preferential mortgages. For a security guard or shop assistant in a provincial town earning 40–60 thousand rubles a month ($500-800), war looks like a social elevator moving far faster than any civilian career.

Fast money attracts vulnerable groups. The average Russian citizen owes banks about 456,000 rubles ($6,000) — roughly seven times their monthly income. An offer of 210,000 rubles a month ($2,700) in the trenches can look less like a death sentence and more like a chance to pay off a mortgage or escape chronic poverty.

This financial ""opportunity"" comes with obvious costs. Beyond the risk of death, corruption in the armed forces is widespread, soldiers often have to cover basic unit needs from their own pay, and reports of inhumane treatment by commanders are common. But that is a separate story.

The Kremlin shifted much of the financial burden of recruitment onto regional authorities. Regions were given quotas, and most incentive payments were funded by local budgets. Signing bonuses rose sharply — like the price of bitcoin during a boom. In 2024 and early 2025, regions competed in generosity: Tatarstan, Samara, and the Yamalo-Nenets region offered more than 3 million rubles for signing a contract. Many others followed with payouts of 2–3 million ($26,000-39,000).

By late 2025, the bubble burst. Budget deficits — recorded in 67 regions — forced authorities to drastically cut payments. In Samara, the bonus dropped from 3.6 million rubles to 400,000 (from $47,000 USD to $5,200). Tatarstan followed suit, reducing payouts to the Kremlin's recommended minimum. Similar cuts occurred across much of the country.

This question is central not only for Ukraine's defense forces but also for international partners. Our team analyzed Russia's mobilization potential across demographic, political, and economic dimensions and identified five possible scenarios for 2026.

The most limited scenario would be a continuation of so-called hidden mobilization, amounting to about 200,000 recruits. With reduced regional payments, recruitment will likely fall below previous levels. The Kremlin will try to compensate: pressuring conscripts to sign contracts, offering deals to criminal suspects, expanding reservist training cycles, and finding other ways to quietly fill the ranks. 

A second possibility would involve a renewed partial mobilization, bringing total additional forces to around 400,000. If battlefield losses rise or Moscow sees an opportunity to shift momentum, a new mobilization wave is possible. Digital registries could make it smoother than in 2022, drawing mainly from the provinces without disturbing Moscow and St. Petersburg. Politically risky, but plausible.

A more expansive scenario — around 700,000 personnel — would likely affect major cities and middle-class families, raising social tensions and straining the economy. Possible, but unlikely unless the situation becomes critical.

A large-scale mobilization of one million troops would be demographically feasible but economically and politically destabilizing. It would require a near-total war economy, border closures, rationing, and possibly asset seizures.

Finally, a total mobilization of up to five million people is essentially unrealistic. Maintaining such a force would exceed Russia's entire security budget.

It is often said that time favours Russia because Ukraine's resources are limited. In reality, economic losses are accelerating the pressure on Moscow as well. The Russian state may be emotionally indifferent to casualties, but it is not immune to economic constraints.

Russia enters 2026 with a military budget exceeding 7% of GDP. That is enormous, yet still insufficient to secure victory. Demographically, Russia still has manpower for large mobilization waves. But economic and political vulnerabilities are significant. A new mobilization would test the regime: is it ready to break its implicit social contract and turn a semi-voluntary war into a forced one? And are Russians ready to fight under compulsion rather than for money? These questions may be answered in the coming months.

The worst mistake would be to treat this analysis as grounds for complacency. Today, the only force capable of stopping Russian advances — and the Kremlin's broader ambitions, including toward EU countries — is Ukraine's defense forces, properly armed and supported.

The year 2026 offers a real chance for Ukraine and its Western partners to significantly weaken Russia. But this chance is not guaranteed. Inaction or delay will push the Kremlin to seek new funding sources, geopolitical alliances, and economic arrangements to sustain the war.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Ukraine, Russia, and the U.S. began a new round of trilateral peace talks in Geneva on Feb. 17, as Washington presses for progress toward a deal before summer. 

The two-day meeting marks the third round of negotiations since January, following earlier sessions that failed to deliver any breakthrough. 

""Security and humanitarian issues are on the agenda,"" National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov said. ""We are working constructively, with focus and without excessive expectations."" 

Zelensky has indicated that the most sensitive issues, including territories and control over the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, remained unresolved after the UAE talks. 

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 16 that this round would cover a broader range of issues than the limited set previously discussed in Abu Dhabi.

""This time, we intend to discuss a wider range of issues, including, in fact, the main issues that concern both the territories and everything else related to our demands,"" he said. 

The trilateral negotiations were formally opened by Swiss Federal Councillor Ignazio Cassis, who welcomed the delegations. The country is hosting the meeting in its traditional role as a neutral facilitator.

""Switzerland is not a party to the negotiations, but actively supports this trilateral approach aimed at promoting de-escalation and the search for lasting peace,"" a government spokesperson told the Kyiv Independent. 

Just hours before the talks began — despite Kyiv having already agreed to participate — U.S. President Donald Trump publicly urged Ukraine to ""come to the table.""  ""We have big talks. Ukraine better come to the table fast,"" he told reporters. ""That's all I'm telling you. We are in a position where we want them to come.""

Peskov told reporters that he did not expect any major developments on the first day, noting that the negotiations were scheduled to continue tomorrow. 

The talks come after a week of pointed criticism from Russian officials, who have suggested that only Ukraine's capitulation would satisfy Moscow's objectives.

In the days before the negotiations, Russia reshuffled its delegation. President Vladimir Putin appointed his aide Vladimir Medinsky to lead the Russian team.

Medinsky previously headed Russia's delegation during direct negotiations in 2025 and during the March–April 2022 talks in Istanbul. Ukrainian officials at the time described him as a ""pseudo-historian"" and accused him of advancing uncompromising positions. 

During the 2025 talks, he reportedly warned that Russia was prepared to fight indefinitely and threatened additional territorial advances if Kyiv rejected Moscow's demands.

Zelensky acknowledged the change on Feb. 14 with visible skepticism.

""It was a surprise that Russia changed the head of the delegation,"" he said. ""In my opinion, they want to postpone the decision (to make a peace deal). Maybe I'm a bit pessimistic.""

Medinsky is joined by Admiral Igor Kostyukov, chief of military intelligence, and Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin, among others.

Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev is also present but is working on a parallel economic track. He may be involved in discussions tied to the so-called ""Dmitriev package,"" a sweeping U.S.-Russia economic proposal that Moscow confirmed last week. 

Ukraine's delegation is participating at a high level. 

The team is led by Umerov and includes Kyrylo Budanov, Zelensky's chief of staff and former military intelligence chief, along with other senior officials.

The U.S. delegation includes Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law. They are expected to be joined by U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and Gen. Alexus G. Grynkewich, commander of U.S. European Command.  

A German government official told the Kyiv Independent that German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's foreign and security policy adviser is also in Geneva. 

Officials from the U.K. and France are present as well and are expected to meet with Ukrainian officials — and possibly U.S. representatives — after the trilateral talks conclude, a source familiar with the matter said.

The Kyiv Independent has learned that these European officials will not participate in direct negotiations with the Russian delegation.

Both Kyiv and Moscow have signaled that the territorial issue will dominate the talks.

Ukraine maintains that freezing current positions offers the most realistic foundation for a ceasefire at this stage. Russia continues to demand that Ukrainian forces withdraw from Donbas as a precondition for any agreement — a non-starter for Kyiv.

The U.S. has floated the idea of establishing a free economic zone in the war-torn region. Zelensky previously said that neither Ukraine nor Russia had shown much enthusiasm for that proposal.

Another unresolved flashpoint is the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Before Russia's full-scale invasion, the plant generated roughly 20% of Ukraine's electricity and remains the largest nuclear power facility in Europe.

Under a U.S.-backed framework, the plant would be jointly operated by Ukraine, the United States, and Russia, with economic benefits shared. Kyiv fears that such an arrangement would effectively legitimize Russia's occupation of the facility.

Energy security more broadly is also expected to surface in Geneva. Russia continues to target Ukraine's energy infrastructure with relentless strikes, and a potential energy ceasefire remains under discussion.

During the Feb. 4–5 talks in Abu Dhabi, the U.S. delegation proposed that both sides once again support Trump's energy de-escalation initiative. 

Ukraine signaled support for the initiative, but Russia did not agree.

The Geneva talks unfold amid public skepticism from Moscow about the broader peace process — a stance that borders on outright rejection.

While trilateral meetings took place in January and February, senior Russian officials openly questioned key elements of the proposed framework.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Feb. 11 effectively dismissed a U.S.-Ukraine 20-point plan that had been expected to form the basis for negotiations.

Lavrov said that ahead of the August summit in Alaska, Witkoff handed Moscow a document outlining key issues ""in line with realities on the ground.""

He claimed that the sides had identified ""approaches based on the U.S. initiative"" that ""opened a path to peace"" and could have formed the basis for a final deal.

""All subsequent versions are the result of an attempt by Zelensky and (Europe) to override the American initiative,"" Lavrov said. ""Now they are waving around some kind of document with 20 points, which no one has given us either officially or unofficially.""

Bloomberg earlier reported that the plan was delivered to Putin in early January, with Witkoff and Kushner later visiting Moscow to discuss it directly with Putin.

Lavrov also warned against what he described as an ""enthusiastic perception"" of the negotiations on Feb. 10, stressing that ""there is still a long way to go.""

His remarks reinforce a broader pattern: while Russia continues to participate in talks, it publicly signals that its baseline demands — including territorial concessions and broader political conditions — remain unchanged.

The Geneva meeting is expected to test whether the sides can bridge their competing versions of the plan, with territorial issues to top the agenda.

A shooter unleashed a flurry of bullets during a Rhode Island youth hockey game, killing two people and injuring three others, in an attack that was cut short when a spectator stepped in to help stop the tragedy, authorities said.

Investigators had spoken to nearly 100 witnesses as of Monday evening as they attempt to piece together what happened earlier that afternoon inside the Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket, a few miles outside Providence.

Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves said Monday that the shooter died from an apparent self-inflicted gun wound, though authorities are still investigating.

Goncalves credited an unnamed “good Samaritan” who intervened, bringing the attack “to a swift end.” She did not provide details.

It is not entirely clear what precipitated the shooting, who was targeted or why. The game was livestreamed by LiveBarn, a streaming platform for youth sporting events, whose videos have been shared on social media showing players on the ice as popping sounds are heard. Chaos quickly unfolds as players on benches dive for cover, those on the ice frantically skate toward exits and fans flee their seats.

LiveBarn's social media account has been issuing warnings to those who shared the video that they do not have permission to do so. An e-mail to LiveBarn seeking comment was sent Tuesday.

“It appears that this was a targeted event, that it may be a family dispute,” Goncalves said. Authorities said both people who died were adults but have not released the identities of the victims.

Goncalves identified the shooter as Robert Dorgan, who she said also went by the name Roberta Esposito, who was born in 1969.

Dorgan was an active employee at General Dynamics Bath Iron Works, a ship building in Bath, Maine, that contracts with the U.S. Navy, David Hench, a spokesperson for the shipyard, said Tuesday. Hench did not immediately respond to questions about Dorgan's job title or how long Dorgan worked at the shipyard.

Monday's shooting came nearly two months after Rhode Island was rocked by a shooting at Brown University that left two students dead and wounded nine others, as well as a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor. Authorities later found Claudio Neves Valente, 48, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at a New Hampshire storage facility.

“Our state is grieving again,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said in a statement. “As governor, a parent, and a former coach, my heart breaks for the victims, families, students, and everyone impacted by the devastating shooting at Lynch Arena in Pawtucket.”

The exercise comes amid growing tensions with the US. The Strait of Hormuz is considered the world's most important gateway for oil transport.

Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) began on Monday a navy exercise in the strategic Strait of Hormuz, state media reported.

The intensive drills, named ""Smart Control of Hormuz Strait"" were being conducted by the IRGC naval forces, and under the supervision of the head of the IRGC, state TV reported.

The drill aimed at testing the readiness of operational forces in the face of ""possible security and military threats,"" the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.

The exercise comes amid growing tensions with the US, both over Iran's nuclear program and its deadly response to anti-regime protests last month.

Talks between Washington and Tehran over the latter's nuclear program have recently resumed, after previous talks collapsed when Israel launched strikes on Iran in June 2025, starting a 12-day war which also saw US strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities.

A fresh round of talks is due in Geneva on Tuesday, to be mediated by Oman.

They come after US President Donald Trump announced plans to send a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East late last week, as he continues to threaten to strike Iran.

Iranian hardliners have threatened to bloc the strategic Strait of Hormuz as tensions with Washington rose.

The Strait of Hormuz is a key waterway that lies between Oman and Iran, and connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea.

The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) describes it as the ""world's most important oil transit chokepoint.""

Large volumes of crude extracted by OPEC countries like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq from oil fields across the Persian Gulf region and consumed globally flow through the strait.

Germany is joining the list of nations considering a ban on social media for children, with both coalition partners drawing up plans. Meanwhile, figures show German industry cut around 124,000 jobs in 2025. DW has more.

Here are the major headlines from Germany on Tuesday February 17, 2026:

Prosecutors in Aschaffenburg have charged a man with murder more than 41 years after the violent death of a trainee nurse in northern Bavaria.

Authorities said the former boyfriend of the 19-year-old Maria Köhler is accused of strangling her with a mesh scarf on July 30, 1984, out of jealousy and revenge.

More than three‑quarters of households in Germany spoke only German at home in 2024.

New figures from the Federal Statistical Office show 77% used exclusively German, while 17% spoke German plus another language. Just 6% did not use German at all at home.

Ahead of International Mother Language Day on February 21, officials said 15.5 million people primarily used another language at home. Turkish was the most common, followed by Russian and Arabic.

Among multilingual households, German remained the main language for about a quarter.

And in households with a family migration history, 22% spoke only German, while 23% spoke no German at home.

The northern state of Lower Saxony's internal intelligence agency will monitor the Alternative for Germany (AfD) political party as a ""surveillance object of considerable import"" on the far-right. 

Interior Minister Daniela Behrens and the state's intelligence agency head Dirk Pejril announced the move at a press conference on Tuesday.

Germany's economy is only slowly emerging from its downturn, with sentiment brightening slightly but remaining gloomy.

Helena Melnikov, managing director of the Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK), said the recovery was moving upward only in tiny steps.

A survey of around 26,000 companies has shown only a marginal improvement in business conditions at the start of the year.

Some optimism has come from export expectations, with 22% of firms forecasting higher shipments over the next 12 months — up three points from autumn.

The DIHK has slightly raised its economic outlook and is now expecting 1% growth in 2026, in line with the federal government.

Germany has been lagging internationally in growth, according to the DIHK.

The association previously forecast 0.7% growth for 2026 in November, while large-scale government spending on infrastructure and defense has been providing support.

The weak mood has long since reached the labor market, the DIHK said.
About 12% of companies plan to expand staffing, while 23% expect their workforce to shrink.

The digital industry group Bitkom says that 44% of people aged 65 and older now use social networks, up from 15% five years ago.

Bitkom said 1,004 people aged 65 and above were surveyed from September to October 2025. Usage was highest among those aged 65 to 69, with about two-thirds active on social media. Among people aged 70 to 74, the figure was 56%.

Use dropped in older age groups. Only 30% of those aged 75 to 79 reported using social networks, and 24% of those aged 80 and above.

Facebook was the most widely used platform among seniors, cited by 60%, followed by StayFriends at 31%. X was used by 20%, Instagram by 19%, and only 5% of social media users aged 65 and older said they used TikTok.

Germany's inflation rate is holding at 2.1% in January, confirming preliminary data and showing price pressures have strengthened at the start of the year, particularly with food and services.

Consumer prices were up only 0.1% from December, as cheaper energy partly offset higher costs elsewhere, according to the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis). Energy prices fell 1.7% year over year, with household electricity down 3.2% and gas down 2.5%, helped by lower grid fees and the removal of the gas storage levy.

Food inflation accelerated to 2.1%, up from 0.8% in December, with especially steep increases for sweets and chocolate. Prices also climbed for fruit and meat, while butter, oils, and potatoes became noticeably cheaper compared with a year earlier.

""Overall, consumer price increases intensified at the beginning of the year,"" said Destatis President Ruth Brand. ""Food prices, in particular, rose more sharply in January than in the preceding months.""

Core inflation, excluding food and energy, remained elevated at 2.5%, highlighting persistent pressure in other sectors. Services rose 3.2% year over year, driven by higher costs in social facilities, transport, and rents.

Germany's industrial companies have cut around 124,100 jobs last year, showing an increasingly negative trend after 56,000 positions were lost the year before, according to an analysis by auditing firm EY.

EY said employment in industry has fallen by about 266,200 jobs, or nearly 5%, since the pre-pandemic year of 2019, with the sharpest reductions recorded in the automotive sector.

Weak revenue performance has driven job losses, the report said, with industrial turnover shrinking by 1.1% in nominal terms, after a steeper 3.5% decline the previous year.

EY found the auto, paper and textile industries were among the weakest performers, each posting revenue declines of roughly 3%.

Nearly 50,000 jobs were lost in the automotive industry alone last year, EY said, bringing the sector's job cuts since 2019 to around 111,000, a drop of 13%.

In contrast, employment rose against the broader trend in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry and in the electrical industry, up 3% and 2% respectively.

""German industry is in a deep crisis,"" EY's Jan Brorhilker said, adding that it would take a clear and sustained upswing to prevent further erosion in employment.

Germany has been debating tougher limits on children's access to social media, with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) now backing restrictions and proposing a formal ban for those under 14.

SPD leader Lars Klingbeil, who serves as Chancellor Friedrich Merz's deputy, told Der Spiegel that clear rules were needed. ""Protecting young people from the flood of hatred and violence on social media is ‌a top priority,"" he said.

A discussion paper signed by SPD lawmakers and state politicians called for platforms to block access for under-14s and to create special youth versions for ages 14 to 16, without algorithm-driven feeds, personalized content, endless scrolling or autoplay.

The paper also proposed making opt-outs from algorithmic recommendation systems the default for users over 16.

The move followed a similar proposal from Merz's conservatives, who have called for a ban for under-16s that is set to be discussed at their party conference.

Coalition pressure has made it increasingly likely the government will push for restrictions, although media regulation in Germany is handled at the state level and would require nationwide coordination to agree consistent rules.

The debate has been influenced by Australia's ban on social media for under-16s and growing European discussions on curbing platform access for children.

Germany last year appointed a special commission to examine online harms facing young people, with a report expected later this year.

Guten Tag from DW's newsroom in Bonn.

You join us as the debate rumbles on in Germany, as in many other countries around the globe, about a partial or full social media ban for under-16s.

Both coalition parties have mapped out how the measure might work in practice.

Australia has already introduced such a ban, and many of Germany's European counterparts are thinking about doing the same.

Somalia and Saudi Arabia signed a military cooperation agreement weeks after Israel's recognition of an independent Somaliland. But what's in it for Saudi Arabia? 

Somalia's defense minister, Ahmed Moallim Fiqi, hailed a new chapter in defence cooperation when he announced on X that he and Saudi Arabia's Prince Khalid Bin Salman had signed a military deal in the Saudi capital Riyadh.

Exact details were not released, but the memorandum of understanding ""strengthens defense and military cooperation between the two countries, and includes multiple areas of common interest,"" according to the Somali Ministry of Defence. 

Separately, Prince Khalid Bin Salman said on X: ""We reviewed topics related to the future of security and defense industry, and recognized the opportunities."" His statement came after meeting defense officials from Somalia, Slovakia, Malaysia and South Korea.

Somalia's military agreement with Saudi Arabia comes weeks after Israel announced it would recognize Somaliland, a northern, breakaway region of Somalia, as an independent state. Somalia has firmly rejected Israel's move, saying it interferes with Somalia's domestic affairs. 

Last month, the Somali state news agency reported that Somalia has signed a defense pact with Qatar also aimed at ""strengthening military ties and security collaboration."" 

The agency said the pact focused on military training and security.

Former BBC Somali editor and Horn of Africa analyst, Abdullahi Abdi Sheikh, told DW the agreement ""means a lot for both countries.""

""For Saudi Arabia it means expanding its influence and reach to the Gulf of Aden, which is also adjacent to what we call the Bab-el-Mandeb area, which is crucial for global trade,"" he explained, adding that at least 10% of global shipping passes through that area.

""Saudi Arabia is trying to spread its influence on Somalia, and Somalia is trying to benefit from the new engagement with Saudi Arabia, especially after the country has had a rough relationship with the United Arab Emirates [UAE],"" Abdi Sheikh told DW.

In the last year, the UAE has become an influential player in the Horn of Africa, which includes Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea and ⁠Djibouti. This has come ⁠in the form of multi-billion-dollar investments, robust diplomacy and discreet military support.

The rivalry between the UAE and Saudi Arabia has grown beyond the conflict in Yemen and competition for influence over the Red Sea. Now, the Horn of Africa region seems to be in both nations' sights. 

At the African Union summit over of the weekend, a senior diplomat told Reuters: ""Saudi has woken up and realized that they might lose the Red Sea."" 

Meanwhile, Abdi Sheikh said the Somalia-Saudi Arabia military deal would help Somalia take charge of its own maritime security while helping its war on terrorism.

""It also helps reduce the influence of countries that are perceived to be sympathetic to Israel's recognition of Somaliland,"" he said.

Somalia has accused the UAE of facilitating Israel's move to recognize Somaliland as an independent state, something it sees as a violation of its sovereignty. In January, Somalia canceled all agreements it had with the UAE, including port operations, security and defense deals.

Sheikh describes Somalia's agreement with Saudi Arabia as  ""a chess move against Israel and its perceived allies."" 

Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud said Somalia would never allow the establishment of an Israeli base in Somaliland, promising to ""confront"" any move towards one.

Hassan Hilowle Abukar, a Somali security analyst, told DW: ""There are many benefits to the cooperation signed with Saudi Arabia which will enable us to tackle these and other issues,"" explaining that Somalia had faced decaded of instability and insurgent violence, particularly from al-Shabab.

Abukar told DW the training, equipping and professionalization of Somalia's national army would strengthen Somalia's defense capabilities and enhance counter terrorism cooperation, as both countries would share intelligence.

Mohamed Abdullahi, a Somali citizen based in Mogadishu, said the cooperation agreement comes at a critical time for Somalia, ""as Somalia's sovereignty and territorial integrity have been tested, particularly following Israel's recognition of Somaliland.""

He added the agreement ""provides not only military assistance but also vital political backing.""

A gunman who identified as a woman killed two people and injured three others at a high school hockey match in Rhode Island on Monday.

The 56-year-old, thought to have been the father of one of the hockey players, shot a woman and her child in the stands at the Dennis M. Lynch Arena before turning the gun on himself.

Tina Goncalves, the Pawtucket police chief, told a press conference on Monday night that the gunman used the name Roberta Esposito.

“We have identified the person, the suspect, by a birth name. The birth name was Robert Dorgan,” said Ms Goncalves. “We have also learned that the person does go by the name of Roberta and also uses the last name of Esposito.”

The suspected gunman sat at the back of the stands on the home team's side during the hockey match before moving to the front and opening fire on four family members and one family friend, WPRI reported.

The mother of a student hockey player died inside Lynch Arena, while her child died later at the hospital, sources told the outlet. Three victims were in critical condition on Monday night. Dorgan died of a self-inflicted gun wound, police said.

The injured included two other family members and a family friend, authorities said.

The motive has not been officially established, but police believe it was a targeted shooting that stemmed from a family dispute.

A source at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives told Fox News that the gunman killed his wife and shot three of his children. Police have not confirmed the identities of the victims.

A woman seen leaving the Pawtucket police station said the shooter was her father, who “has mental health issues” and was “very sick”. She said: “He shot my family, and he's dead now.”

In early 2020, Dorgan told the North Providence Police Department that he had undergone gender-reassignment surgery and that his father-in-law wanted to kick him out of his home because of it.

Dorgan told police that his father-in-law, who has the same surname, threatened to “have him murdered by an Asian street gang if he did not move out of the residence”, court documents show. A year later, he was divorced by his wife.

Ms Goncalves revealed that a “Good Samaritan” had stepped in and disarmed Dorgan, but the shooter had a back-up weapon, which police retrieved at the scene.

In footage taken from the live-stream of the game, a succession of more than a dozen gunshots can be heard while the players are on the ice. The players scramble to get off the ice, while spectators run for the exits.

The rink and surrounding businesses were evacuated. Footage showed a heavy police presence, along with federal agents, around the building. One witness told CBS News that she saw someone attempting CPR on the victims.

The two teams competing at the time were made up of teenage players from multiple local schools. Officials said all the students during hockey time were safe and accounted for.

Mayor Don Grebien called the shooting “tragic” but stressed that it was “an isolated incident”.

He said officers were working with the Rhode Island Attorney General's office “to ensure the facts are fully established” before any further comment was made.

“Pawtucket is a strong and resilient community, but tonight we are a city in mourning. We will stand together to support all those affected in the difficult days ahead, and we will keep the public updated as confirmed facts become available,” said Mr Grebien.

Katherine Clark, a Democratic representative for Massachusetts, called it a “senseless tragedy”. She urged Congress “to pass common-sense legislation to end this cycle of gun violence once and for all”.

Last week, a transgender teenager shot and killed his mother and brother at home before killing five students and one teacher in a mass shooting at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School in British Columbia, Canada.

In the US, five mass shootings have been carried out by transgender or non-binary Americans since Jan 2013.

In 2023, Robin Westman, a 23-year-old male shooter who self-identified as a woman, killed two children and injured 18 others in an attack on a church in Minneapolis.

Meanwhile, digital profiles linked to Thomas Crooks, who tried to assassinate Donald Trump in July 2024, suggested he may have identified as non-binary.

There is still “reason to distrust” the company, one security expert said, warning it has backtracked on plans before.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

Ring, the doorbell and security systems company owned by Amazon, announced last week it was canceling its partnership with surveillance company Flock Security following immense backlash to a Super Bowl commercial touting its artificial intelligence (AI) technology.

The integration with Flock was first announced in October. Ring released a statement on February 12 stating that the planned partnership with the company “would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated.”

“We therefore made the joint decision to cancel the integration and continue with our current partners,” Ring added on its website, further stating that the partnership between the two companies “never launched, so no Ring customer videos were ever sent to Flock Safety.

The timing of the announcement, though, came within a week of Ring's controversial Super Bowl ad. 

Within the spot, which aired to an audience of more than 120 million people, Ring touts its AI technology as being able to help find lost dogs using its doorbell cameras. The feel-good advertisement was quickly viewed with skepticism, as people noted that the tech could be used to provide information on humans to police departments or federal agencies, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Indeed, Flock, which sells its surveillance tech to police departments around the country, already sees its dragnet used by federal immigration agents, even at times in violation of the law.The company has helped corporations make “watch lists” against labor and social movement organizers. 

“We already know [Ring has] a form cops can fill out to get access to footage without warrant or permission in an ‘emergency' as determined by them. What will this mean for new features?” surveillance and policing expert Matthew Guariglia explained. 

Importantly, the announcement that the two companies wouldn't integrate with each other doesn't negate the fact that Ring already utilizes biometric identification into its products, including in features like “Familiar Faces.” 

“It doesn't take much to imagine Ring eventually combining these two features: face recognition and neighborhood searches,” read a statement last week from Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a nonprofit group that aims to defend civil liberties and rights of people in the digital world.

Experts are also skeptical that Ring will not try to bring Flock back into its fold sometime in the future. The Amazon-based company partners with other security companies, like Taser and body camera company Axon, through which it runs a program that allows law enforcement access to Ring footage. The program is similar to a prior one run independently by Ring that allowed police to request videos, which was shut down after backlash. 

“Customers of Ring and the bystanders their cameras surveil have reason to distrust the company's assurances” from last week, Dave Maass, director of investigations at EFF, said in an email to Truthout. 

“Ring has a long history of privacy failures and violations that go back years before it announced its partnership with Flock,” Maass added. “Furthermore, surveillance companies like Ring have previously made promises amid public pressure only to backtrack later.”

In the last weeks, we have witnessed an authoritarian assault on communities in Minnesota and across the nation.

The congressman from Florida is facing backlash after he said he would choose dogs over Muslims.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

Critics are demanding the censure and even expulsion of a Republican US congressman after his latest bigoted remarks against Muslims.

The firestorm began on Sunday when Rep. Randy Fine (R-Fla.) responded to a sarcastic social media post by Palestinian American activist Nerdeen Kiswani, who jokingly suggested that New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani's election meant that “NYC is coming to Islam,” and it was time to consider banning dogs as pets because “like we've said all along, they are unclean.”

“If they force us to choose,” Fine wrote, “the choice between dogs and Muslims is not a difficult one.”

Kiswani insisted that her post was not meant to be taken at all seriously, and was rather her attempt to satirize some Americans' fears about having a Muslim elected to lead the largest US city.

“If Americans cared as much about abused children as they do about posts joking about dogs,” she wrote, “we might actually be facing a national reckoning. Instead watching some of the same politicians who resisted transparency around the Epstein files discover their outrage over this is telling.”

Many Democratic lawmakers were quick to condemn Fine for suggesting that the US expel Muslims.

“We must call this what it is. Disgusting bigotry,” wrote Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.). “Fine must be censured. It's about morality and decency, not politics.”

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) joined Khanna's call to censure Fine.

“This is genuinely one of the most disgusting statements I have ever seen issued by an American official,” she wrote. “It should not stop shocking us that the Republican Party openly embraces this. Fine should be censured and stripped of committees. To ignore this is to accept and normalize it.”

Rep. Rob Menendez (D-NJ) argued that Fine's statement “is what it looks like when Islamophobia and outrage are the only two items on your political agenda,” and demanded that House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) issue a formal condemnation.

Jennifer Jenkins, a Democrat running against Fine in Florida's 6th Congressional District, said that censuring the Republican lawmaker was not enough.

“Randy Fine has spent years spewing hate: attacking entire faiths, calling for violence, targeting kids and families, and dehumanizing Americans,” she wrote. “He's only escalated. Congress must act now and expel Randy Fine immediately.”

Fine appears undeterred by the condemnation he's received, appearing on Newsmax Tuesday morning to push false claims about Democrats wanting to ban pet dogs.

“People should know Democrats like [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] are saying ‘we are going to get rid of your dogs,'” Fine falsely claimed. “Americans need to keep that in mind when they go and vote in November.”

In the last weeks, we have witnessed an authoritarian assault on communities in Minnesota and across the nation.

A grassroots campaign that united patients and providers succeeded in expanding mental health care access. Here's how.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

Access to mental health care is rapidly expanding in Illinois, thanks to a legislative victory won through a grassroots campaign that united patients and health care providers to take on the power of the health insurance industry. As organizers who worked on the campaign, we're excited to share the story of our win with the hope that it will give momentum and inspiration to similar campaigns in other states.

Our recent victory came on December 12, 2025, when Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker signed House Bill 1085 into law, expanding access to mental health care for about 2.5 million people in our state. This bill requires private insurers to pay mental health and substance abuse treatment providers fairly, and more in line with physical health care, so they can afford to accept private insurance, with the goal of ending ghost networks (lists of providers that are not actually available to take patients) and increasing the number of therapists working in Illinois. The win was a result of three years of grassroots organizing by people who have faced barriers to accessing mental health care and therapists who have been exploited by insurance companies.

Our organization, The People's Lobby, decided to work on this campaign because a significant proportion of our members have faced huge problems in accessing quality health care as a result of profiteering by health insurance corporations. Starting in 2023, we joined the People's Action's “Care Over Cost” campaign to connect with other groups across the country organizing for health care justice. After a year of listening to our members, educating our leaders about the barriers to getting quality care, and strategic conversations with state legislators, we decided to join mental health advocates in working to pass HB 1085 as our first campaign to limit the power of health insurance companies and guarantee higher-quality and more affordable care to patients.

Organizing the people who provide care and who need care to tell their stories is essential in creating a sense of urgency in the face of opposition from health insurance corporations.

In the process we learned a few key lessons about what it takes to expand access to health care. First, having credible and hardworking legislative sponsors matters a lot. Second, organizing the people who provide care and who need care to tell their stories is essential in creating a sense of urgency in the face of opposition from health insurance corporations. Third, showing up relentlessly in our state capitol and in local communities helps ensure health care reform remains a priority in the face of other major crises state legislatures may need to address. Lastly, and maybe most importantly, a significant portion of private insurance (about 40 percent in Illinois) is regulated at the state level, and so in states where Democrats hold power, they can, if they choose, make reforms that meaningfully expand access and quality of care.

Health care policy is complicated and the details matter. Lead sponsor Illinois State Rep. Lindsey LaPointe holds a Master of Social Work (MSW), worked for a number of years as a social worker and human service provider, and deeply understands the barriers to care. The legislative sponsors worked with behavioral health policy experts like Heather O'Donnell, formerly of Thresholds, who crafted the language and amendments, relying on data from both Milliman and the Research Triangle Institute which enumerated the disparities in pay between providers of physical and mental health care. State Sen. Karina Villa, the original and long-time senate sponsor of the bill, also holds an MSW and worked as a school social worker prior to becoming a state legislator. Both sponsors met regularly with O'Donnell, The People's Lobby, and other allies to coordinate messaging and lobbying strategies.

The stories of therapists were critical in persuading legislators to act in spite of the opposition from insurance corporations. Legislators were often startled to hear that many of them hadn't received a real raise in a decade, forcing them to stop accepting insurance, take on an unsustainable number of patients leading to burnout, or leave the profession altogether. Furthermore, for many years, insurance corporations required therapists to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), meaning they could not tell anyone how much they are paid or bargain together for livable wages. One therapist, who asked to remain anonymous so as not to violate her NDA, said, “I have been in private practice for 15 years. Over the course of that time, we have seen no significant increases and often decreases in our annual rate change that is set by the insurance companies and for which providers have zero power to negotiate.”

It was equally important that patients played a leadership role in this campaign and frequently told legislators their stories of the barriers to accessing mental health care. These barriers often resulted in people being forced to pay out of pocket, to delay care while searching “ghost networks,” or to simply go without care.

Alysson Light, associate instructional professor at the University of Chicago and a leader with The People's Lobby, struggled to find a therapist for depression related to providing care for her husband following his organ transplant in 2020. In the winter of 2023, she described herself as exhausted and emotionally numb, unable to balance her own wants and needs against the care her husband needed. Light searched her list of in-network providers, but found many were no longer in the network or did not provide services she needed, what advocates call “ghost networks.” Her husband, who happens to work as a therapist, helped her comb through the list. After three months they found just one practice in Chicago that was equipped to provide care and accepted her insurance. In a further testament to the need for HB 1085, Light's spouse continues to provide therapy to patients in Pennsylvania, where they lived before they moved to Chicago, rather than take the financial hit of practicing in Illinois.

To build the team of therapists and patients willing and able to share their stories and lead this campaign, we held seven town halls throughout Chicago and its suburbs. People showed up because they received personal invitations from The People's Lobby's members, or because they heard about the town halls through therapist listservs, emails from The People's Lobby or allied elected officials, or social media. We began these town halls with a bit of education about why people were not able to access mental health services that insurance corporations say they cover, then we broke into small groups to hear from patients and therapists about their struggles to get or provide care. Elected officials were often present to hear their stories.

We also invited people who attended to tell their stories to legislators in other ways. Despite the Illinois state capitol being three hours away from the closest part of the Chicago metro area, therapists and patients made the trip seven times during the last year of the campaign. We organized another 20 visits with legislators in their districts and sent more than 7,000 letters to legislators during the final year of the campaign. This level of activity helped us work closely with Senate President Don Harmon to keep this issue alive during a time when the state legislature was addressing a state budget crisis and working on a bill to save regional public transportation from a $750 million fiscal cliff.

It's also important to note that HB 1085 builds on other recent Illinois health care reforms. Rate review, which takes full effect in 2026, will require insurance corporations to justify rate increases to the Illinois Department of Insurance (DOI). In lobbying against HB 1085, insurance lobbyists claimed they would have to raise premiums in order to increase provider pay, and rate review will give the DOI some ability to assess the veracity of this claim. The Healthcare Protection Act, which passed in 2024, bans high-deductible and low-coverage insurance (known to advocates as “junk insurance”), ends the practice of requiring patients to try less-effective medicine and fail before covering medicine prescribed by their doctors, and requires insurance corporations to pay for proven standards of care rather than allowing them to define their own, among other provisions.

When organizers and elected officials work together to expand access to care and control costs, we build momentum toward Medicare for All.

Even on the heels of resounding defeats in Washington, D.C., Democrats can make real improvements to health care access and then campaign on those improvements in states where they hold power. Almost anyone who has been sick or helped a loved one navigate the health care system has firsthand experience with the ways health insurance corporations consistently delay and deny care. This anger is widely and deeply felt, and people will feel substantive reforms quickly. When organizers and elected officials work together to expand access to care and control costs, we build momentum toward Medicare for All, and convince other elected officials that taking on the power of health insurance corporations is both good policy and good politics.

The story of how grassroots organizers fought to pass this bill is particularly important in this moment, when as many as 17 million Americans will lose health care due to Medicaid work requirements and cuts to Affordable Care Act subsidies that help people pay for insurance on the marketplace.

To justify allowing these subsidies to lapse, President Donald Trump has cynically adopted one critique from the left, complaining about “money sucking insurance companies.” It's true that insurance corporations maximize profits by taking our premiums and routinely denying necessary and lifesaving care, but in the absence of Medicare for All, the solution is regulating private insurance corporations, not abandoning people to whatever predatory plans or rates insurance corporations are willing to offer. In order for people in the U.S. to get the dignified health care they deserve, we need to do so much more than give insurance corporations more money.

Expanding access to corporate insurance doesn't get at the root of the problem. We have to get creative about other policies that improve access and affordability — and if we organize, it's very much within our power to win.

In the last weeks, we have witnessed an authoritarian assault on communities in Minnesota and across the nation.

The need for truthful, grassroots reporting is urgent at this cataclysmic historical moment. Yet, Trump-aligned billionaires and other allies have taken over many legacy media outlets — the culmination of a decades-long campaign to place control of the narrative into the hands of the political right.

Her family was lucky: Her mom and mom's partner worked at the hospital, one of the few places not laying people off. At 18, she got a Rotary Scholarship to Argentina, an experience that led her to question the ideology that “America knows best,” to begin to understand that the meritocracy is a lie, and to become really curious about U.S. foreign policy. Like a lot of Ohioans, Kristi moved to Chicago for a job after college. She spent 20 years doing organizing and communications work.

 Why America Must Build a New Operating System

 Nadia Schadlow

  March/April 2026 

Power shifts are never easy. A major one is now underway, not between rival states, but between competing approaches to international order. Call it a clash of two operating systems. One view holds that the most pressing issues of the day can be addressed only through a framework of global and supranational institutions and multilateral rules. The other insists that the nation-state remains the foundation of legitimate authority and effective action, and that outcomes ultimately depend on the decisions, capacities, and accountability of individual states.

For much of the post–Cold War era, what one can call a “global first” approach dominated international thinking. Governments, international organizations, and nongovernmental actors shared the assumption that challenges to do with security, economic disruption, migration, pandemics, and climate change required global solutions. The collapse of the Soviet Union and China's accession to the World Trade Organization accelerated economic globalization, reinforcing the belief among leaders in the United States and elsewhere that global institutions were best suited to manage complexity and preserve peace. For decades, these institutions (and the governments and the phalanx of nongovernmental organizations that supported them) advanced a common creed: that only global bodies could tackle the defining problems of the age.

Yet the results of this global-first model have been uneven at best. Despite decades of negotiations, global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, and no major economy is on track to meet the targets set by the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change. Record numbers of people have been displaced, migration has destabilized domestic politics in many countries, and armed conflicts are more numerous and protracted than at any point since the end of the Cold War. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed failures in global health governance, while progress toward the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals has fallen dramatically short of ambitions.

At the same time, China rose rapidly within this global order, accumulating economic, technological, and military power while selectively exploiting international rules and arrangements. Today, China is mounting the most serious strategic challenge the United States has faced since the end of the Cold War, discrediting the notion that deeper integration and multilateral engagement would produce a more cooperative and stable international system.

Instead of assessing why decades of global efforts have failed, many leaders dig in their heels. The current UN secretary-general, António Guterres, frequently laments that multilateralism is “under fire,” warning that there is no path forward except through “collective, common-sense action for the common good.” What this view leaves largely unexamined is the possibility that the fault lies in the limitations of the global-first approach itself.

In the 2010s, long-simmering doubts about the post–Cold War global order rose to the surface. The United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union in 2016, as well as mounting impatience in Europe and elsewhere with supranational institutions, had already begun to erode many of the assumptions that shaped the policies of Western governments after 1991. U.S. President Donald Trump accelerated this shift when he assumed office in 2017, but he did not start it.

In his second term, Trump argued in his September 2025 address to the United Nations that despite the organization's “tremendous, tremendous potential,” it was not “coming close to living up to that potential.” The 2025 U.S. National Security Strategy states that “the world's fundamental political unit is and will remain the nation-state.” Trump's withdrawal from dozens of international organizations, his call in January for a “Board of Peace” that would bypass the UN Security Council, his cuts to international aid, and his challenges to trade and immigration orthodoxies have been widely denounced, but the president's actions reflect a broader rejection of global-first pieties. His clear priority, in places such as Iran and Venezuela, is to act on the basis of national interest and collective defense without first deferring to global bodies.

Beneath Trump's theatrics, however, lies a coherent claim: only states generate problems (their industries pollute), experience those problems (their citizens suffer), and hold the means to address problems (through revenues, infrastructure, and services). Only states acting to advance their own interests—whatever the implications for so-called international order and norms—can solve problems that global institutions and processes have so far failed to fix.

The global frame functions much like the passive voice in English: it conveniently detaches agency from problems and obscures true causes. It also produces elaborate organizational processes that impede real progress. Even advocates of global approaches acknowledge that international negotiations often entangle officials in dense webs of meetings, procedures, and rules. These layers of complexity slow action or prevent it altogether.

Disagreements over these competing operational approaches matter. They are straining alliances, complicating partnerships, and fueling accusations of isolationism, while leaving many of the world's most vulnerable populations no better off. By challenging failing global frameworks, a state-centric approach could produce truly positive change—and place states back at the center of practical action.

The United States both shaped and was shaped by the rise of the global order in the twentieth century. The horrors of World War I, in which industrialized warfare killed an estimated 20 million people, severely undermined faith in the nation-state as the foundation of international order. The League of Nations emerged just afterward as the first major supranational experiment in collective security. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson described the league as a “community of power,” arguing that states must yield freedom of action to a common council to preserve peace. The novelist H. G. Wells went further, arguing that “there can be no great alleviation of the evils that now blacken and threaten to ruin human life altogether, unless all the civilized and peace-seeking peoples of the world are pledged and locked together under a common law and a common world policy.”

But the league failed to prevent the chaos of World War II, and it is doubtful that it would have succeeded even had the United States joined. After that war, countries again sought to build a more durable peace. The United States emerged as the principal architect of the post-1945 international system, using its unmatched economic and military power to forge new global institutions. It led the creation of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which governed global trade for nearly five decades before the creation of the World Trade Organization.

Over time, member states ceded elements of their sovereignty—authorizing the UN Security Council to define threats to peace, empowering the WTO to adjudicate trade disputes and authorize retaliatory tariffs, and allowing the IMF to lend large sums to states with balance-of-payment problems—in exchange for the promise of a more stable world. State power would be constrained not only by domestic constitutions but also by international law and the rules of international institutions.

In Europe, where nationalism had fueled some of the twentieth century's most devastating conflicts, pressure grew to find alternatives to the power of the nation-state. The European Economic Community, founded in 1957 and later broadened into the European Union, rested on the belief that economic interdependence could tame conflict. By deepening integration and limiting national sovereignty, European leaders argued, war could be made not only undesirable but implausible.



Over time, transnational and supranational efforts to move beyond the nation-state gained ground, and international institutions steadily widened their authority. The UN now encompasses dozens of funds, programs, and specialized agencies. The IMF evolved from a narrow focus on balance-of-payments support into a far broader role in macroeconomic surveillance, crisis lending, and structural reform, while the WTO grew into an expansive regime governing services, intellectual property, and dispute settlement. At the same time, many of these bodies became less accountable to states. Donor states are often frustrated that UN development agencies consider themselves to be autonomous from the governments that fund them, even when those governments ask for audits of how their money is spent. Member states exercise tenuous control over the World Bank. As staff, budgets, and mandates expanded, these institutions increasingly evolved from instruments of states into bodies with their own agendas.

The collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War contributed to the widespread belief that a new international community was emerging and that the ascendancy of the United States as the sole superpower would usher in a system of collective security and an ever-growing democratic zone of peace. After the collapse of the Berlin Wall, U.S. President George H. W. Bush hailed the arrival of a new era. Later, after the United Nations condemned Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, he observed that countries could now “seize the opportunity to fulfill the long-held promise of a new world order, where brutality will go unrewarded and aggression will meet collective resistance.”

China's accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001 rested on a similar set of assumptions. U.S. and European policymakers believed that integrating China into global markets and institutions would encourage the country's economic liberalization, expose Beijing to international rules and norms, and gradually temper its strategic ambitions. As China grew wealthier and more embedded in the global economy, many expected it to become a responsible stakeholder in the liberal international order. That did not happen; China instead used its access to the world economy to grow rich and threaten that order.

This global mindset was also reinforced by the rise of multinational corporations, increasingly treated as global actors. Although formally subject to national laws, their scale and reach often allow them to shape state behavior. Technology firms influence regulatory outcomes on taxation, privacy, and market access; energy companies negotiate directly with governments over investment, sanctions, and climate policy; and financial firms, whose assets often exceed the GDP of many countries, exert influence through capital allocation and engagement with regulators and central banks.



All the while, global groupthink deepened. Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan popularized the idea of “problems without passports,” arguing that many challenges were too diffuse for individual states to address alone. The UN's 2000 Millennium Declaration framed hunger, poverty, conflict, and social injustice, for example, as global problems, a vision embodied in its 2015 Sustainable Development Goals. Although the UN now concedes that many targets will not be met, it largely avoids questioning whether its original ambitions were realistic. Most recently, the organization has promoted global approaches to managing the risks of artificial intelligence.

A global mindset seized much of civil society and the commentariat. By the 1970s, an informal global governance movement had emerged alongside formal institutions, arguing that interdependence required stronger multilateral cooperation or “common management,” the phrase employed by the Trilateral Commission, one of the transnational bodies established in that era. By the 1990s, such ideas had hardened into dogma. Influential commentators such as Thomas Friedman hailed globalization as the dominant force shaping domestic politics and foreign relations, and thousands of nongovernmental organizations became formally linked to the UN, embedding nonstate actors into global institutions.

The global frame has found its way into many U.S. and European initiatives. The Biden administration's Build Back Better World initiative was rooted in “a unified vision for global infrastructure development.” The European Union's Global Gateway project aims to tackle the “most pressing global challenges,” including climate change, pandemics, and the security of global supply chains. A powerful global architecture came to define the post–Cold War order. Yet this order turned out to be as fragile as it was ambitious.

More than 75 years since the post–World War II push toward global approaches, the optimism that animated support for these institutions has given way to a more sobering reality. The architecture of global governance expanded, but that governance did not become more effective. The global order was supposed to generate collective strength: countries, working together, could do more and make resources go further. In practice, however, it created layers of bureaucracy that siphoned resources away from addressing the problems at hand. Devotion to process replaced attention to outcomes.

Tackling climate change has been approached primarily through global, multilateral frameworks for more than three decades under the auspices of the UN. Despite the constant warnings about the existential threat of climate change, global emissions of carbon dioxide had reached their highest level on record in 2025. All G-20 countries are off track to meet the 2015 Paris accords' goal of limiting global warming to below two degrees Celsius by the end of the century. The global approach to reducing carbon emissions is clearly not working.

In the realm of human rights, multilateral responses have too often proved ineffective or counterproductive. The willingness of international institutions, particularly the UN, to treat authoritarian regimes as legitimate participants has insulated these countries from reproach and censure. Nowhere is this failure more evident than in the UN Human Rights Council, which has been regularly co-opted by some of the world's worst human rights violators. While the council issues resolutions and hosts dialogues, Iran kills and imprisons civilians with impunity and China subjects Uyghur Muslims to a harsh regime of arbitrary detention and surveillance. Multilateral human rights mechanisms have often shielded perpetrators rather than constrained them.

In development, increasingly ambitious yet abstract agendas advanced by international institutions often overlook the socioeconomic conditions that determine whether aid truly works. Despite wide variation in state capacity and local circumstances, initiatives such as the UN's Sustainable Development Goals rest on the premise that “all countries and all stakeholders” can deliver any number of outcomes, from ending the AIDS epidemic to eradicating extreme poverty by 2030. Yet hundreds of millions of people still lack reliable access to electricity, food insecurity has worsened, and water stress continues to intensify across many regions. While the United Nations highlights the global decline in poverty between 1990 and 2015, it also concedes that a substantial share of the world's population will remain poor well beyond 2030. Similarly, the World Bank acknowledges that progress on poverty reduction has stalled and that, at current rates, lifting everybody above even a modest threshold of roughly six dollars per day would take more than a century. It is unclear how recommitting to those same global processes, such as additional summits and greater international coordination, would produce better outcomes.



After the Cold War, it was widely assumed that free trade would alleviate global poverty. Liberal commerce would lift all boats, and a supranational rule setter, the WTO, would ensure an ever-rising tide. In practice, however, the WTO struggled to make trade genuinely free. Persistent distortions, such as China's subsidies and unfair trade practices and the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (which shields European producers through subsidies and price supports), highlight the WTO's inability to curb entrenched protectionism. These weaknesses are compounded by the WTO's failure to clearly distinguish between state-owned and private firms, a flaw most evident in cases involving China, in which the line between state and market is blurred.

Migration has become a central flash point in the clash between global and national approaches. Migrants increasingly try to enter countries as asylum seekers even when their motivations are largely economic. This dynamic has strained asylum systems and roiled the politics of many receiving countries. Yet rather than confronting whether the system is working as intended, its defenders call for increased funding for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, reinforcing a model that expands humanitarian administration without resolving the underlying drivers of displacement.

In the realm of nonproliferation and direct threats to the United States and its allies, global approaches have repeatedly fallen short. For decades, the UN, other multilateral bodies, and ad hoc coalitions relied on diplomacy, inspections, and economic pressure to constrain the nuclear ambitions of states such as Iran and North Korea. In both cases, agreements and UN resolutions slowed aspects of these programs at times but failed to halt their underlying momentum.

In Iran, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action temporarily constrained elements of the country's nuclear program without dismantling its enrichment capabilities or the infrastructure needed to resume progress. In North Korea, successive agreements, talks, and sanctions failed to prevent Pyongyang from advancing its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, allowing it to cross the nuclear threshold. In both cases, regimes used negotiations to buy time, relief, or legitimacy while continuing to expand their capabilities. Meaningful disruption of Iran's nuclear trajectory occurred only through direct U.S. and Israeli military action—measures that invariably drew international condemnation—while the absence of comparable enforcement against North Korea allowed Pyongyang to emerge as a de facto nuclear-armed state. Together, these cases suggest that insisting on multilateral consensus and global approval has not prevented proliferation and has often enabled it by prioritizing process over outcomes.



Across these and other areas, many leaders confronted with today's cascading crises come to the same diagnosis: too little global cooperation. Instead of considering alternative approaches, supporters of the global frame insist that the clear remedy is to reinforce existing institutions by affording them more authority, funding, and effort.

In economic policy, a 2023 IMF report warned that geoeconomic fragmentation undermines shared goals and argued that restoring trust requires a “robust global financial safety net with a well-resourced IMF at its center.” This logic, however, conflates coordination with institutional centralization, overlooking the limits of centralized authority. The same reflex appears in security, often at the expense of U.S. interests. As conflicts have multiplied, calls to revitalize collective security have focused on strengthening the UN Security Council, despite decades of paralysis caused by the politicized use of the veto and great-power rivalry. From Syria to Ukraine to Gaza, UN deadlock has neither deterred aggression nor protected U.S. allies, forcing Washington to rely on ad hoc coalitions and unilateral action. Global security mechanisms frequently fail to safeguard American interests, but many policymakers argue that they simply need to be empowered further.

A similar pattern characterizes climate policy. Missed targets have prompted demands for more ambitious pledges and financing instead of serious reassessment of whether consensus-driven frameworks can deliver results amid divergent national priorities. The pattern repeats in global health, where failures exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic led to demands for a stronger World Health Organization when scrutiny of the performance of centralized global processes in major crises was more warranted.

These cases point to a broader tendency: when global frameworks underperform, their advocates refuse to change course. Yet cooperation has often advanced more effectively through regional arrangements, bilateral agreements, and policies aligned with the capacities of particular states. The question is not whether cooperation is necessary—of course, it is—but whether reinforcing the same global approaches again and again protects vital interests or merely mistakes process for progress.

A new operating system is worth a try. The remedy for the shortcomings of global institutions is not greater deference to them but a return to square one: the nation-state. A state-anchored approach recognizes that it is states, not global institutions, that are directly accountable to citizens. In democracies, governments face political consequences when they fail, a chain of accountability weakened when authority is delegated to international organizations. States also possess the capabilities to solve problems. Although global bodies can convene debates and issue resolutions, the power to fund, regulate, and fight resides with sovereign governments. A state-first approach thus strengthens both accountability and effectiveness.

Effective cooperation is best pursued through coalitions of the willing, not through frameworks that diffuse authority across multilateral forums with divergent interests. Collective action works when participating states agree on means and ends. Insisting that decision-making include actors with conflicting objectives often produces paralysis, not progress. A state-based approach accepts that cooperation cannot be presumed, especially with rivals or adversaries, and that broad, consensus-driven arrangements are unlikely to deliver meaningful outcomes. Instead, it prioritizes practical collaboration among allies and partners through intelligence sharing, coordinated policy, and shared capacity, grounded in real power, compatible political systems, and aligned national interests.

A state-anchored approach also acknowledges that time is a decisive dimension of success in any policy domain. When countries become trapped in prolonged multilateral negotiations, time becomes a liability, delaying action while problems compound. Global processes move slowly, if at all. States offer a better chance of acting with speed and flexibility and of delivering results.



The actions of states could be more effective than those of global bodies in various areas. Consider climate policy. A state-anchored approach could better align climate objectives with the realities of countries' needs for energy security, growth, and technological development. Emerging energy options such as geothermal and nuclear fission and fusion will mature only when national governments provide the regulatory frameworks, financing, infrastructure, and policy commitments to support their advancement. The economic historian Daniel Yergin has written in these pages that the energy transition will unfold differently in different parts of the world, at different rates, with varied mixes of fuels and technologies, shaped by governments establishing their own paths. In practice, a state-anchored approach to climate change recognizes where responsibility, authority, and capacity truly reside.

In a similar vein, states should forge an international trading regime through their actions, not their submission to multilateral bodies. In a world of divergent economic systems, bilateral and regional trade agreements offer a more practical approach to trade governance and strategic interests than do institutions such as the WTO. Unlike multilateral frameworks that require consensus among dozens of countries, often with incompatible economic models, these agreements allow similar states to negotiate rules that are more likely to be implemented and enforced. Trade agreements among institutionally compatible partners will work better than universal regimes that attempt to impose common rules across fundamentally different systems. In an increasingly fragmented global economy, this model offers a realistic path forward: trade integration among willing, capable, and trustworthy partners instead of lowest-common-denominator rules that fail to discipline the most distortive practices.

In global health, one of Washington's most successful initiatives was the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, launched in 2003. Designed and driven by the United States, the state-centric program made hundreds of investments that resulted in major reductions in mortality and infection rates related to HIV/AIDS, especially in Africa. Its success demonstrated the effectiveness of targeted, data-driven assistance anchored in national leadership and accountability. Years later, the Obama administration implicitly recognized this reality with its Global Health Security Agenda, which emphasized concrete state commitments to strengthen national public health capacities, not new global rules. Its premise was that only strong and capable state institutions could handle pandemics. That initiative functioned as a corrective to WHO-led frameworks that had set obligations without producing sustained national improvements.

In defense, NATO offers a good example of the state-based approach. Although Article 5 in NATO's charter commits allies to common defense, it deliberately preserves national sovereignty: each state retains control over its forces and the authority to decide how and when they are employed. The alliance does not replace national militaries; it depends on them. Deterrence flows from state capacity: the quality, readiness, and credibility of national forces, combined with the political will behind them. A common defense organization works because it aligns state capabilities toward a common purpose.



Beyond formal alliances, smaller, purpose-built coalitions have often proved more effective than universal frameworks in addressing concrete threats. These include the AUKUS agreement among the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia to deter China in the Indo-Pacific, as well as bilateral cooperation between Japan and the United States. These agreements work because they have the backing and direction of the United States. Consider, for example, the fact that American assistance was vital in saving Ukraine from complete Russian conquest. Russia was not deterred from invading Ukraine by global institutions or universal norms, but it has been constrained by NATO's arms transfers and sustained military support for Kyiv. Global forums condemned the invasion, but it was NATO's material power, coordination, and credibility that limited the war's geographic spread and raised the costs of further escalation. Likewise, the territorial defeat of the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) in Syria and Iraq in 2019 was achieved not through UN processes, but through U.S.-led coalitions of willing states combining intelligence sharing, targeted military force, and partner capacity building. Across these cases, security outcomes have depended less on global institutions than on coalitions of capable states acting decisively when interests align.

A similar logic applies in counterproliferation. The Proliferation Security Initiative, a voluntary counterproliferation framework launched by the George W. Bush administration in 2003, was not a treaty or supranational body but a practical mechanism designed to strengthen national authorities, share intelligence, and interdict shipments of illicit weapons—such as nuclear materials and missile components. It relied on coordinated national action, not formal supranational institutions, to fulfill its mission. This flexibility allowed the framework to adapt through regional initiatives, from the Mediterranean to the Pacific, and to remain effective as proliferation pathways evolved.

In development, a growing body of scholarship suggests that international efforts to support poorer economies cannot overcome the limitations of state capacity and ill-conceived domestic policy choices. Economists such as William Easterly and David Dollar have long argued that differences in economic policy among developing countries at the national level explain much of the variation in growth performance, especially among African countries, and that no amount of foreign aid can substitute for domestic reform. Top-down global planning produces grand targets without mechanisms for delivery.

Against this backdrop, Africa may be emerging as a testing ground for a different model that treats national governments as the primary drivers of reform, not mere implementers of global agendas. Despite decades of international spending, nearly half of sub-Saharan Africa's population lacks access to electricity. In January 2025, 12 African countries launched National Energy Compacts with country-specific targets, explicitly anchoring responsibility in national policy and institutions. Given the mixed record of global frameworks, this state-anchored approach offers a pragmatic test of whether national ownership can deliver results.

The record of the past several decades should invite humility but not resignation. Across many arenas, the results delivered by so-called global solutions have been mixed at best, suggesting that an operating model defaulting to universal frameworks deserves reexamination. This does not mean abandoning international cooperation. Reorienting toward state-anchored approaches and an emphasis on outcomes reflects a belief that cooperation matters too much to accept arrangements that fail to deliver. It is a necessary correction to ensure that cooperation actually works.

A state-centric shift does not reject multilateral institutions. It calls for a more realistic appraisal of their limits and a clearer focus on what they do best: convening, sharing information, and enabling coordination when interests align. Too often, global bodies are asked to perform operational tasks for which they lack authority and capacity. Only states possess the political authority, citizen accountability, and implementation capacity to deliver durable results that large global frameworks have repeatedly failed to achieve.

This debate is no longer abstract. The divide between globally minded and state-centered policymakers has become a prominent fault line in contemporary geopolitics, shaping transatlantic debates in particular. In Washington, leaders are doubtful that existing global institutions are delivering concrete outcomes, while their European counterparts continue to stress the importance of these institutions in sustaining the postwar order. At its core, this debate reflects a shared concern: that democratic governance must adapt if it is to remain effective, credible, and capable of producing results in a more competitive world. Slow, consensus-bound systems have left democratic states less able to respond to emerging challenges, especially from China. Beijing, for instance, has exploited process-heavy governance by flouting international rules in subsidizing its steel and solar industries, knowing that by the time cases wind through the WTO, competitors have often already been wiped out.

A state-centric operating model starts from a simple but hopeful premise that democratic states, working with partners, remain capable of shaping outcomes. Global frameworks have proved insufficient for many of the defining challenges of the twenty-first century. Progress is more likely to come from persuasion, coalitions of the willing, and direct cooperation among governments. This concrete action will not just produce tangible and positive results; it will also uphold democratic values—and in a more convincing way than the lofty bureaucratic architecture of global institutions ever could. The United States and other democratic states must stop deferring to the sclerotic global order and find their own solutions to the major problems of the age.

 How U.S. Strategy Failed—and Ceded the Advantage to China

 Zack Cooper

  March/April 2026 

The pivot to Asia has failed. A decade and a half ago, in 2011, President Barack Obama committed to rebalancing U.S. strategy and resources to focus on the Asia-Pacific. “Let there be no doubt,” he pledged on a visit to Australia, “The United States of America is all in.” Although the phrasing changed and policymakers and politicians argued about the tactical details, Obama's successors affirmed the logic behind the pivot, which soon became the core bipartisan assumption of American strategy. In speech after speech, U.S. officials emphasized that the only way to prevent China from dominating Asia was for the United States and its allies and partners to make a major investment in the region's political, economic, and military stability.

Yet nearly 15 years later, U.S. leaders have still not matched their words with action. American promises to foster greater prosperity and better governance now elicit eye rolls throughout Asia. A perpetually distracted United States neglects much of Southeast Asia, South Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Few today are asking when the pivot will come. Instead, the question in regional capitals is how far the United States will pull back.

With the United States facing divisions at home and distractions abroad, it has become clear that deep engagement across all of Asia is no longer realistic. Yet the assumptions behind the pivot have persisted, as have the calls to finally give the effort priority. The problem is that having a strategy that cannot be executed in the foreseeable future creates dangers of its own. During World War II, the political commentator Walter Lippmann wrote that “foreign policy consists in bringing into balance, with a comfortable surplus of power in reserve, the nation's commitments and the nation's power” and warned that not doing so “leads to disaster.” Today, Washington has a “Lippmann gap” in Asia: means have failed to match ends for so long that U.S. commitments have lost credibility. The longer the gap between pledges and action is allowed to remain, the greater the risk of a disastrous failure of deterrence.

The pivot to Asia was based on the assumption that U.S. power was capable of fostering strong regional economies, governments, and militaries that could prevent China from overturning the regional order. Today, however, Washington is not seriously contesting Beijing's economic and political influence across much of the region, particularly on the Asian mainland. The Trump administration's 2025 National Security Strategy explicitly narrows U.S. regional security objectives to protecting the first island chain—a string of archipelagoes that runs through Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines—but this retrenchment has been proceeding quietly for years.

Parts of this thin defensive line rest on shaky ground: countries that are economically dependent on China and thus vulnerable to its political pressure and influence campaigns. China will naturally seek to displace the United States if Washington scales back its commitments. The pivot aimed to make that difficult, if not impossible, by locking in U.S. engagement and ensuring that countries in the region were strong and confident enough to uphold their interests. By serving as a counterweight to China's massive economy and substantial political influence, the thinking went, the United States gave these countries options. But as the United States curtails its economic and political engagement, it faces the prospect that China could pick off U.S. allies and partners one by one. Many of these countries are already rethinking their alignment decisions and concluding that Beijing may be a more appealing partner—or an inevitable regional hegemon.

As a result, any U.S. strategy that focuses primarily on the military defense of a handful of countries on the first island chain may not be sustainable. But the better option—a comprehensive pivot—is now a practical impossibility. What is left is a strategy based on shoring up a defensive line that might not hold forever but could contain Chinese expansion for now. If executed well, such a strategy could buy enough time for missteps by China to create new openings for the United States and its allies and partners in Asia. Chinese regional dominance is by no means assured. Beijing is increasingly overconfident and is likely to overplay its hand. Still, Chinese leaders are now the ones with the cards to play. The pivot was meant to anchor U.S. leadership in Asia; its unraveling could leave China to set the rules.

When it introduced the pivot, the Obama administration outlined three pillars on which the rebalance depended: security, prosperity, and good governance. The central logic was that promoting all three would make the United States' Asian partners stronger and better able to defend their sovereignty, thus preventing China from overturning the regional order. In practice, however, only the security pillar received sustained U.S. attention and resources. Washington deepened its alliances with Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea and pledged to shift 60 percent of U.S. Navy assets to the Indo-Pacific. But it never delivered on its vision for economic engagement or good governance.

At first, the United States had a plan for regional economic engagement. The Obama administration championed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-country trade agreement that included many of Washington's most important regional partners. The objective, in Obama's words, was to enshrine “an open international economic system, where rules are clear and every nation plays by them.” But the United States proved unwilling to be bound by the very rules it had helped write. The Senate refused to ratify the TPP by the end of Obama's term, and then the first Trump administration withdrew from the accord altogether in 2017 and began imposing tariffs on Chinese goods. The Biden administration did little to change course. It kept most of Trump's tariffs in place and showed no interest in joining the successor to the TPP. An intended replacement put forward in 2022, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity, did not offer increased access to the U.S. market, disappointing foreign partners. As Singapore's ambassador to the United States lamented in 2023, “We're not getting the kind of trade agenda that we would have liked” from the Biden administration.

In Trump's second term, coercive and protectionist economic policies, combined with the dissolution of development aid and humanitarian assistance programs, have made the situation worse. For leaders in Asia who want to deliver economic growth to their people, a more protectionist United States is less attractive as a partner—and China looks more attractive by comparison. Asian officials are fond of saying that they “don't want to choose” between Washington and Beijing. But regional leaders worry that, when it comes to their economic relationships, choices are becoming unavoidable, and many may favor China.



The pivot's governance pillar has crumbled even more spectacularly. Democracy, anticorruption, and human rights were important elements of this agenda when it was first announced. The Obama and Biden administrations made the promotion of democracy and human rights central to their policies, seeing them as both moral and strategic imperatives. This aroused suspicion across much of Asia, where less than half of people live in free societies. When the Biden administration held its 2021 Summit for Democracy, it excluded Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam. The omissions put many South and Southeast Asian governments on the defensive, worried that the United States was undermining their domestic political systems.

The second Trump administration has been quiet about human rights and democracy, which has comforted some autocrats. Yet many regional leaders find it troubling that the United States is now rejecting many of the rules, norms, and institutions that it once advanced as part of its good governance initiative. Washington is using economic coercion against its own allies and partners. It has launched military strikes against Iran and Venezuela, which many smaller Asian countries worry will be perceived as a dangerous precedent that China or other great powers might use to justify attacks on weaker neighbors. Finally, U.S. anticorruption efforts stalled when Trump paused enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act shortly after his 2025 inauguration. Countries are now supporting major commercial projects that involve the Trump family in hopes of currying favor with the U.S. government.

Not surprisingly, Washington's reputation has taken a hit across much of Asia. According to a 2025 Pew Research Center survey conducted during the first few months of Trump's second term, favorable attitudes toward the United States in Australia, Indonesia, Japan, and South Korea had declined by nine to 16 percentage points from a year earlier. If the United States continues to embrace force and coercion—dismissing the rules, norms, and institutions that once tied American hands but bought the country influence—its favorability ratings will decline further, and other countries will be even less inclined follow Washington's lead.

As the economic and governance agendas have collapsed, the full weight of the rebalance has come to rest on the security pillar. Yet even on security, Washington has not delivered all it initially promised. The United States has remained distracted by crises elsewhere in the world. It never shifted away from the Middle East, and the Biden administration, faced with a major war in Europe, rightly chose to support Ukraine. The Trump administration's focus on the Americas adds yet another competing priority. As a result, U.S. leaders have never had enough time to consistently engage South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Only Australia, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan have attracted sustained attention and resources from the United States.

The problem has worsened lately. In the last year, top-tier U.S. military assets—carrier strike groups and air and missile defense units—have been pulled away from Asia to assist with other missions. Recent increases in overall U.S. defense spending have barely kept pace with inflation, and even if the Trump administration succeeds in forcing allies and partners to spend more, their contributions cannot offset China's massive outlays. This leaves Washington without the means to execute a region-wide approach. Recognizing this constraint, U.S. policymakers have tightened their focus, concentrating American diplomacy and defense strategy on the Taiwan Strait to the detriment of other parts of the region. This shift has been most obvious under the Trump administration, but it has been underway for nearly a decade.

Nowhere are the effects more evident than in South Asia. For two decades, U.S. officials pursued a deeper relationship with India. But the second Trump administration has undone much of this progress. American intervention in the May 2025 conflict between India and Pakistan created the perception that Trump was prioritizing Islamabad over New Delhi, and the fallout has pierced hopes that India might align more with the United States. The Quad, the security partnership among Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, had strong backing in Trump's first term but now appears to be on the verge of obsolescence: a planned 2025 summit never materialized because of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's obvious irritation with Trump and Trump's apparent indifference to the group.



The story is not much better in Southeast Asia or the Pacific Islands. In his first term, Trump admirably improved ties with the Philippines, Vietnam, and many Pacific Island countries. Today, the U.S. treaty alliance with the Philippines remains strong, with frequent bilateral meetings and deepening defense cooperation. Yet other Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore, are reevaluating their policies toward the United States. Singapore's prime minister has lamented that the United States “is rejecting the very system it created,” by adopting protectionist policies and imposing tariffs on its friends. This view is also held by many Pacific Island countries, where Washington's downgrading of issues that matter to them—including development, public health, and climate change—is incentivizing closer cooperation with Beijing.

The one subregion the United States seems committed to is Northeast Asia, home to Washington's top security concern: China. In the 2025 National Security Strategy, China is mentioned more than any other U.S. adversary, and Taiwan is mentioned more than any other American ally or partner. The section on deterring military threats in Asia is almost entirely focused on preventing an invasion of Taiwan; North Korea is not mentioned once. In effect, the United States has narrowed its conception of its security interests in Asia to cross-strait security.

Yet even U.S. policy toward China and Taiwan remains muddled. Trump insists that Chinese leader Xi Jinping will not take Taiwan on his watch, and his administration has pressed regional allies to allow American forces to use their territory and to contribute their own forces if a conflict breaks out in the Taiwan Strait. But Trump himself has not publicly stated what he would do in a cross-strait conflict, instead commenting in January that it is “up to Xi” how to handle Taiwan. He has even referred to the U.S.-Chinese relationship as a “G-2,” suggesting he is interested in some kind of great-power compact.

The basic logic of the pivot was that it was in the United States' interest to help build strong economies, effective governments, and capable militaries across Asia because this would make it harder for China to overturn the regional order through coercion or the use of force. Countries in Asia would then be free to make the choices that benefited them most, which Washington assumed meant continued cooperation with the United States. But with all three pillars cracked or crumbled, the constraints U.S. policymakers tried to place on China's regional influence are giving way.

As Washington's economic and political engagement recedes, with no reversal in sight, military deterrence is all that remains of U.S. strategy in Asia. But the United States' traditional approach to regional security, weakened as it has been, is increasingly courting danger. Its original objective was to prevent China from altering the territorial status quo anywhere in the region, which required the United States to maintain a forward defense perimeter up to the coast of the Asian continent. Washington aimed to help allies and partners with which Beijing or Pyongyang had territorial or maritime disputes—including India, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam—to deter the use of force or coercion. The United States regularly sent ships and aircraft just off China's coast in an effort to prevent China from coercing Washington's friends or exerting control over disputed territories, waters, and airspace. It also invested in regional militaries to ensure that they could better defend themselves and work more closely with American forces. And as the American military edge deteriorated, the United States called on receptive Asian allies to increase their own defense spending and host additional U.S. forces on their territory.

The main problem with this approach was that it required not just American military engagement but also a positive economic and governance agenda to be successful. Building effective militaries requires dynamic economies and efficient governments, and only a network of strong regional militaries can help smaller states defend their interests against China. Without steady U.S. support for economic growth, good governance, and regional integration, the entire region's deterrence posture suffers. Making matters worse, a growing chorus of critics in Washington argues that it is no longer powerful enough to execute such an expansive strategy, that the strategy is needlessly provocative to Beijing, and that too few countries in the region are willing or able to step up military cooperation with the United States. Others insist that the American people are tired of foreign entanglements and unwilling to support the rise in military spending that this strategy demands.

In short, meeting the most expansive version of American security aims in Asia has become unrealistic. The gap between those objectives and U.S. and allied capabilities is apparent to all, including China. And Beijing has been only too willing to take advantage. Despite long-standing U.S. opposition to Chinese land reclamation in the South China Sea, Beijing has restarted its island-building campaign there. It is also stepping up military pressure on Taiwan, raising the risk of a cross-strait crisis. Deterrence is eroding across the region, intensifying the danger of a major war in the years ahead.



Avoiding that outcome requires that the United States align its commitments and capabilities. Yet there is danger in pushing retrenchment too far, such as by concentrating U.S. defenses along the second island chain, thousands of miles east of the Chinese mainland (or even on the third island chain, which includes Hawaii). In this scenario, Australia and Japan, established U.S. allies that lie at the southern and northern ends of the second chain, could still anchor the American regional military presence. Between them, the defensive line would comprise many small isles stretching over thousands of miles, including the Bonin Islands, the Mariana Islands (most notably Guam), Yap, and Palau. This strategy would exclude several friends in East Asia from the U.S. defense perimeter—the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan—effectively conceding that the United States would not defend them against an attack.

A second-island-chain strategy would push many Asian leaders to cut deals with Beijing. All of Southeast Asia would be within China's sphere of influence, so the Philippines and other claimants bordering the South China Sea would have little hope of upholding their rights in disputed waters. South Korea would find itself isolated and surrounded by nuclear powers in China, North Korea, and Russia; without the U.S. extended nuclear deterrent, Seoul would have to choose between acquiring its own nuclear weapons and submitting to demands from Pyongyang and Beijing. Taiwan, which China would never permit to have nuclear weapons, would likely be forced to unify with the mainland or face an unwinnable war.

There is no guarantee that China would be satisfied with this U.S. withdrawal, either. It is likely that a stronger, more confident Beijing would expand its horizons to match its growing capabilities. Japan, then, could be particularly vulnerable. Beijing is already contesting Japan's legal claims to Okinawa and other parts of the Ryukyu Island chain. Japan's westernmost island, Yonaguni, is only 70 miles from Taiwan, so defending it and isles near it with conventional weapons would be difficult, perhaps impossible, if Chinese forces were stationed in Taiwan. The United States could threaten nuclear escalation to deter Chinese encroachment, but that threat might not seem credible amid a broader regional withdrawal. Japan might then decide to go nuclear itself or at least reach a nuclear sharing arrangement with the United States, to more credibly defend its territory.

The geography of the second island chain presents a final problem. These small, remote islands and the facilities they house would be vulnerable to Chinese military strikes and political influence. Without facilities in the Philippines and Taiwan able to track Chinese air and naval forces passing through the first island chain, it would be harder to detect these forces before they reached Guam or other second-island-chain territories. Additionally, leaders in some Pacific Islands might prefer to remain neutral and accept Chinese investment offers rather than allow the United States to operate from their territory. This is already a concern in Yap, where Chinese companies are rebuilding a World War II–era airfield. A second-­island-­chain defensive line might therefore look more like a set of scattered defense bubbles than a full-fledged defensive perimeter. Ultimately, this minimal strategy might not protect U.S. territories in the Pacific and could leave even the most capable American allies feeling they had no choice but to submit to a vast Chinese sphere of influence.



Withdrawal to the second island chain, in sum, would likely be catastrophic. The more realistic option is thus U.S. retrenchment to the first island chain. This approach would trim U.S. commitments while retaining some of the most capable U.S. allies and partners, including Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines. The United States would likely maintain its presence in Australia and South Korea, given its enduring alliances with both countries and its desire to avoid leaving crucial allies out of the U.S. defense perimeter, a costly mistake Washington made ahead of the Korean War. But it would leave most of the rest of the region off the list of U.S. priorities, including the treaty ally Thailand and the emerging great power India. In practice, this could mean, for example, abrogating the U.S. alliance with Thailand and stating explicitly that the United States will not intervene if China encroaches on the territory or maritime claims of partners on the Asian mainland.

This strategy still faces several challenges. First, it is not clear that American leaders would be willing to devote the resources it requires. Although Trump has floated a $1.5 trillion defense budget for 2027, few in Congress seem inclined to support what would amount to a 50 percent increase in defense spending. The United States would still have commitments up and down the first island chain, including to the Philippines and Taiwan, neither of which can deter China without considerable U.S. assistance. Additional defense spending, or at least redeployments from other regions, might therefore be necessary. After all, China can focus most of its military might on its near seas, whereas Asia remains one of several areas of operation for the U.S. military. If Beijing fields nine aircraft carriers by 2035, as a recent Pentagon report predicted it will, U.S. forces would be badly outnumbered, even if Washington economized elsewhere.

Furthermore, the first-island-chain strategy would require key allies and partners to strengthen their cooperation with Washington while the United States pulled back elsewhere. The United States simply cannot balance China's military power unless Australia, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan spend more on defense, give U.S. forces greater access to their territory, or do both. Yet their leaders could be wary of doing more if they see overall commitment to U.S. alliances waning; some might even consider whether it would be wiser to improve relations with Beijing than to give in to Washington's demands. This problem is compounded by domestic divisions in the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan. Political parties in each country take sharply different approaches to foreign policy, so changes of government often bring strategic reassessments. The more the United States is seen as unpredictable and coercive, the more pressure there will be on a new leader to change course. And as Beijing's economic and political influence grows, it will become harder for Washington to respond to Chinese efforts to affect decision-making in Manila, Seoul, and Taipei.

This strategy would also do little to discourage the rest of the region from engaging more deeply with China, because it would not make the United States more attractive as an export market or more active diplomatically. Thailand is already strengthening economic and military ties with Beijing. If others, such as India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore, also choose to work more closely with China, the United States could be forced to watch from the sidelines as Beijing builds a sphere of influence covering most of continental Asia and part of maritime Asia, as well—making a defense of the first island chain increasingly difficult to sustain.

However flawed a pullback to the first island chain may be, it is the most likely outcome in the years ahead. The challenge will be to shore up this thin defensive line as much as possible to maintain deterrence for as long as possible. Allies and partners along that chain will need to be strong and confident enough to work with the United States to counterbalance China, even in the absence of a U.S. economic and political strategy in the region. What will determine success, therefore, is not just how well Washington resources its military posture but also how it navigates complex regional geopolitics.

American policymakers will need to decide whether the United States can build an interlocking set of security alliances or let a scattering of individual defense partnerships suffice. The Biden administration encouraged allies and partners in Asia to work more closely together, whereas the Trump administration has at times preferred a bilateral approach because it maximizes U.S. leverage. Even an informal arrangement bringing American allies together would require a substantial investment of time and resources from Washington and regional capitals. Some countries would no doubt remain hesitant to cooperate with one another because of historical tensions, legal restrictions on foreign entanglements, fears of being dragged into others' conflicts, and concerns about China's response. Yet without deeper defense industry cooperation and operational integration among regional militaries, it might not be possible to build a sufficiently strong defensive system along the first island chain.

The United States will also have to decide how to handle allied interest in acquiring nuclear weapons—something it has, until now, opposed. If the United States abrogates some of its commitments and pulls back some of its conventional forces, the likelihood of allied proliferation will increase. Japan and South Korea, in particular, may pursue nuclear deterrents of their own if they perceive U.S. extended deterrence to be weakening. Simply rejecting nuclear discussions may not dampen interest, particularly in Seoul, which is surrounded by nuclear-armed states. Indeed, some in Washington might even welcome allied proliferation to offset the worsening conventional military balance and thereby deter encroachment by China or North Korea. One option to examine seriously is the development of nuclear sharing arrangements, which might mollify Asian allies without resulting in significant regional or global nuclear proliferation.



As Washington retrenches, Beijing is likely to test the remaining American positions, raising questions about what Washington is and isn't willing to defend. Chinese forces are already pushing closer to Taiwan and operating more frequently and in larger numbers around Japan, around the Philippines, and farther into the Western Pacific. To date, the United States has been most clear about what it will do to protect its closest allies but more ambiguous when it comes to other partners' defense. Friends that Washington asks to do more are likely to press for clearer U.S. commitments in return. Such clarity might deter dangerous tests of those commitments, but it also entails risk. Removing ambiguity about what the United States considers to be within its defense perimeter—especially when it comes to contested outlying islands, which are harder to defend—would make it necessary to react more forcefully to any violation to maintain deterrence. In cases in which the United States is genuinely willing to escalate, clarity is often the best policy, but that means that vaguer commitments will likely be tested.

Finally, the United States will need to decide whether to retrench abruptly or incrementally. A slow withdrawal might prevent panic but leave all allies and partners fearful that they could be next on the chopping block; a rapid adjustment could avoid a slow-moving landslide but cause immediate instability if allies and partners do not have time to prepare. Either way, Washington will need to reset allies' expectations about future American policies, making some disruption unavoidable. But a one-time change in the U.S. defensive position might be preferable to repeated reminders that the United States is shifting its posture. Allied leaders must be quietly consulted beforehand, however, so that they can adjust their own strategies accordingly and express confidence about the new approach to their publics.

It would have been far better for the United States to properly resource a strategy featuring deep economic engagement and support for good governance alongside a stronger security posture. Yet wondering whether that version of the pivot to Asia would have succeeded is now just an academic exercise. An incomplete pivot, with expansive security objectives but no economic or governance strategy to speak of, will certainly not succeed. Instead, it will risk—in fact, it is already risking—a catastrophic failure of deterrence. Moving on from the pivot and accepting retrenchment is not the best way to protect U.S. interests in Asia. But it is unavoidable.

In 2024, Fumio Kishida, then Japan's prime minister, told the U.S. Congress that he detected “an undercurrent of self-doubt among some Americans about what [the United States'] role in the world should be.” Today, that undercurrent looks more like a tsunami, and countries in the Asia-Pacific region are already seeking higher ground. What is left in its wake—where the United States maintains its commitments, and where it pulls back—will affect the lives of hundreds of millions of people in Asia. It is therefore time for Americans to discuss not what would make for an ideal strategy, but how to enact a realistic one. Even that may not be enough to contain China's growing influence. But after falling short of its grand ambitions in Asia, the United States has left itself no other option.

March/April 2026

 And the Unilateral Temptation

 C. Raja Mohan

  March/April 2026 

From Washington to Beijing and Moscow to New Delhi, a consensus is emerging that the world has entered a multipolar era. Political leaders, diplomats, and analysts routinely declare that unrivaled American dominance has ended and global power is now dispersed across multiple centers. The assertion has become so commonplace that it is often treated as a self-evident fact rather than a proposition to be examined. Even officials in the United States, long the principal beneficiary of the unipolar post–Cold War order, have adopted this language. At the start of President Donald Trump's second term, Secretary of State Marco Rubio observed that Washington's moment as the sole superpower was historically “not normal” and that the international system would inevitably tend toward multipolarity. Rubio's statement appeared to echo the growing belief in China, Russia, and much of the developing world that the United States' power is declining and its long-standing global primacy is unsustainable.

This seeming convergence obscures a difference in how the various players define “multipolarity.” For the Trump administration, acknowledging multipolarity doesn't mean accepting limits on American power. Instead, it serves as a justification for abandoning the traditional U.S. conception of global leadership and the responsibilities that come with it. The idea of multipolarity allows Washington to pursue a narrower, more transactional foreign policy—one focused on extracting advantage rather than underwriting order, unconcerned with the maintenance of institutions or norms that do not serve immediate American interests. For China, Russia, and many developing countries, by contrast, multipolarity is not merely descriptive but aspirational. It is a political project aimed at constraining American dominance, eroding Western-led institutions, and constructing alternative models of governance, development, and security in which the United States is not the only country in charge.

The idea of multipolarity has been popular since the United States emerged as the sole dominant power at the end of the Cold War. After the 1990–91 Gulf War, which revealed the scale of American military superiority, French leaders warned of the dangers posed by the American “hyperpower.” China and Russia later transformed this critique into a strategy, seeking to organize resistance to U.S. primacy. They established what they declared to be a “strategic partnership” in the late 1990s and formed the multilateral BRICS alliance along with Brazil, India, and South Africa to coordinate among non-Western powers. They believed that such efforts could accelerate the transition away from American hegemony.

Trump's return to office made the arrival of a multipolar moment seem inevitable. The United States was internally divided, economically unsettled, and weary of global commitments. China's economy had grown to nearly the same size as that of the European Union, and the country had become a formidable technological leader in its own right. Russia's war in Ukraine had demonstrated Moscow's willingness to use force to revise borders in Europe. And BRICS had expanded to include new members in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, reinforcing the impression of a rising alternative system to counter American dominance. Many observers concluded that the multipolar world had arrived and that American unipolarity was living on borrowed time.

A year later, however, this conviction appears misplaced. The Trump administration has embarked on a forceful reassertion of American power by imposing onerous tariffs, intervening in other countries, and brokering peace negotiations and commercial dealmaking across the world. China and Russia have resisted Washington on select issues, but they have been unable to mount a comprehensive challenge to the United States' effort to restructure global rules. Washington's European allies have proved even less able to stand up to the United States. Facing Trump's insults and pressure, they have wilted and caved.

The reality is that the world is still unipolar. The illusions of multipolarity have not created a more balanced international arrangement. Instead, they have done the opposite: they have empowered the United States to shed previous constraints and project its power even more aggressively. No other power or bloc has been able to mount a credible challenge or work collectively to counter U.S. power. But unlike in the prior period of unipolarity that emerged at the end of the Cold War, the United States is now exercising unilateral power shorn of responsibilities.

Claims that the world is becoming multipolar rely on observable indicators of the growing strength of emerging powers, including shifts in relative shares of global GDP and the construction of new development and governance institutions headquartered outside the United States and Europe. These changes show that power is distributed more widely today than at the end of the Cold War. But they do not necessarily signify a transformation in the structure of the international system.

Defined narrowly, a pole is a state or bloc that possesses comprehensive capabilities to shape the international system. A pole is not merely influential in one or two domains, such as nuclear warfare or trade, but rather must be capable of projecting military power globally, sustaining technological and industrial leadership, anchoring alliances, shaping norms, providing public goods, and absorbing systemic shocks. When measured against this more demanding standard, the number of genuine poles in the world today is the same as it has been for the past 35 years: one. Only the United States has this global reach and power.

With an economy now at $30 trillion and growing between two and three percent annually, the United States remains the world's foremost economic engine. Its defense expenditures—around $1 trillion in 2025—exceed those of the next several major powers combined. Washington retains a unique ability to project its power: it has an unparalleled network of alliances, military bases, and logistics infrastructure across the world. American firms dominate frontier sectors as varied as artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and biotechnology. U.S. universities are central nodes in global innovation networks, and American cultural industries shape narratives and tastes worldwide.



Constraints on American power—high national debt, domestic political division, frictions with U.S. allies, and resentment against U.S. policies in the so-called global South—are real and growing, but they do not negate the United States' position as the only credible pole in the system. Even Trump's threats to cut the funding of domestic universities and research agencies, for instance, are unlikely to destroy their preeminence. The depth of the U.S. private sector and the strength of its civil society limit the damage that any president can cause. And the United States' enviable geography, which includes ample natural resources and physical distance from the Eurasian landmass that has long been the main theater of global conflict, gives the United States a large margin of error in its foreign policy choices.

Many analysts argue that the world is evolving toward bipolarity as China continues to rise. In its 2025 National Security Strategy, for instance, the United States acknowledged that China is a “near peer.” China has become a major economic and technological power: its economy has reached about two-thirds the size of that of the United States, its nuclear arsenal is estimated to have tripled in size since 2020, and it is building up its military to counter U.S. influence along the first island chain stretching from Japan to the Philippines in the western Pacific.

Yet China remains some distance from being a true pole in the international order. Its growth rate is slowing and is likely to slow even further because of demographic decline and the outsize role of state-owned enterprises in its economy. Its currency lacks global reach: few international transactions are conducted in renminbi because of strict capital controls and a lack of financial transparency. China's military has strengthened its position in East Asia but lacks the logistics networks, access to bases, and alliances required to project power worldwide. And its much-heralded development programs, most notably the Belt and Road Initiative and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, have supplemented rather than replaced U.S.-anchored global governance institutions such as the World Bank.



Russia, often portrayed as a cornerstone of multipolarity, possesses even fewer of the attributes required to shape the international system. Although it has nuclear weapons and a good deal of conventional military power, its economy is narrowly dependent on natural resources, it has fallen far behind in developing emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics, and, like China, it faces a declining population. The European Union, another potential pole, has economic clout but remains politically divided and dependent on the United States for its security. Europe is now trying to make amends by ramping up defense spending, but even in the best-case scenario, it will have to rely on U.S. military power for many years to come.

The so-called middle powers—Brazil, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey—are growing in economic weight and regional political influence, and are increasingly represented in global forums such as the G-20. Yet influence does not confer pole status. India, which has the size and potential to become a great power in the long term, has a per capita GDP of less than $3,000 (compared with about $85,000 in the United States). It faces deepening political divides and suffers from weak institutions, underdeveloped human resources, and entrenched bureaucratic resistance, all of which have stymied reforms to accelerate economic growth and improve governance. Facing conflict with Pakistan on one border and tensions with China on another, India will still need an economic and security partnership with the United States and its allies for the time being.

Efforts to build countervailing coalitions to the United States have also faltered. Despite China's and Russia's claims that they have a “no limits” partnership, their relationship rests on uneasy foundations and is shaped by historical mistrust and asymmetric dependence. In the early stages of the Cold War, the Soviet Union was the “elder brother” on which communist China depended for political support; now, Russia is the junior partner, heavily reliant on China for imports of industrial and dual-use goods—those valuable for both military and civilian purposes, such as machine tools—and as a market for its energy exports. BRICS has also expanded, and the list of countries seeking to join is long. But BRICS is not a cohesive coalition, nor is it likely to position itself against the United States. Instead, most of its members are eager to strike deals to work with Washington. The inclusion of numerous pairs of regional rivals—India and China, Iran and Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Ethiopia—also limits the effectiveness of BRICS as a geopolitical tool to pursue any particular strategic objective.

The first year of Trump's second term has punctured the narrative of American decline and the rise of multipolarity. Trump's assertive use of economic, diplomatic, and military power to push U.S. interests highlights the extraordinary freedom of action the United States enjoys. The weak international response to Washington's aggressive trade policies, its interventions in Latin America and the Middle East, and its threats to take new territory have exposed how difficult it is for any coalition to mount effective resistance to the United States. Power is spread more widely across the international system than it was at the end of the Cold War, but that diffusion makes it harder to channel collective action against Washington.

When Trump began dismantling the multilateral trading system by imposing across-the-board tariffs in April 2025, most major trading powers did not push back. The European Union, for instance, chose accommodation over confrontation. Invoking the need for U.S. support in the war in Ukraine, EU leaders accepted Washington's tariff demands with little protest—an episode that the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis compared to the Qing dynasty's submission to unfair British treaties in 1842 that launched China into what became known as its “century of humiliation.” Japan and South Korea, meanwhile, agreed to invest $550 billion and $300 billion, respectively, in the United States while granting Washington leeway over how to spend the money and manage the returns. India, which was hit with a 25 percent reciprocal tariff and an additional 25 percent penalty for purchasing Russian oil, refused to yield on many U.S. demands but was careful to avoid any public argument with Washington.

Only China retaliated. Beijing's decision to restrict exports of rare-earth elements, which the United States depends on for many advanced manufacturing components, forced Washington to the negotiating table and led to an agreement to de-escalate the tit-for-tat tariff war. Although Beijing's power play showed its growing leverage over Washington, China has been unable to force the United States to lift many of the onerous economic and technology sanctions it has imposed over the past decade, including curbs on Chinese companies' access to U.S. chips.



Trump's military actions have shown that the United States can discard its own longstanding positions and ignore international outcry with little consequence. In the Middle East, Trump intervened in the June 2025 Israel-Iran war by attacking three Iranian nuclear sites with 30,000 pound “bunker buster” bombs, which only the United States possesses. Then, after many Arab countries had spent two years denouncing Israel's actions in Gaza as genocide, Trump persuaded them to endorse his plan to resolve the war in Gaza with an arrangement that prioritizes Israel's immediate security demands. Trump also pushed the UN Security Council in November 2025 to adopt a resolution on Gaza that conditions Palestinian statehood on reforms to the Palestinian Authority, the governing body currently in charge in the West Bank. China and Russia criticized the resolution's lack of emphasis on Palestinian self-determination but declined to veto it because they did not want to jeopardize a cease-fire.

In Venezuela, Trump's decision to launch a stunning military operation to seize the country's leader, Nicolás Maduro, and bundle him off to face trial in New York was met with some public outcry but little opposition. Europe, usually a champion of the importance of international law, seemed to accept Trump's unilateral action to avoid a confrontation with the United States. China and Russia condemned the U.S. assault as a violation of Venezuela's sovereignty, but neither could meaningfully respond as Washington moved swiftly to reorient Caracas away from its ties with Beijing and Moscow. But unlike its prior interventions during its unipolar heyday, the United States expressed no desire for regime change, nor did it try to justify its actions under the guise of democracy promotion. Instead, Trump quickly partnered with the remnants of Venezuela's authoritarian order to ensure U.S. influence and promote American energy interests.

For now, no other power can stop the United States. The main constraints on U.S. unipolarity are in the United States itself. A major domestic political shift toward the Democratic Party in the 2026 midterm elections or a significant foreign policy quagmire could temper some of Trump's unilateralism. But Trump has avoided many of the problems that befell the United States in Iraq or Afghanistan by setting narrow strategic objectives and being open to working with dictators and democrats alike. Even more important, the forces supporting the United States' assertive unilateralism extend beyond Trump. An American foreign policy establishment accustomed to the ease of unilateral action will likely continue to pursue it no matter who is in the White House.

The revised world order is one in which the United States sheds the responsibilities of a unipolar power but remains the sole force that can shape the international system. Over the past decade, China and Russia have used their military advantage to alter territorial realities: China has aggressively reclaimed land in the South China Sea, for instance, and Russia has conquered and annexed large swaths of Ukrainian territory. The United States, which previously criticized such actions, now also openly employs force to advance its interests. But whereas the leaders of previous U.S. administrations cloaked interventions in liberal rhetoric, Trump frames them explicitly in terms of American power. In a remarkable interview with CNN after the operation to capture Maduro, the Trump adviser Stephen Miller bluntly articulated the administration's worldview: we live, he said, in a world “that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power: these are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.”

Trump's seemingly uncompromising demand for ownership of Greenland is the most explicit case of this new paradigm. He has indicated that full control of the lightly inhabited island is more important than preserving NATO, which has been the bedrock of the U.S.-European alliance for eight decades. Europe, long accustomed to NATO and the U.S. security umbrella, is struggling to adapt to the end of its friendly relationship with Washington and the shattering of its much-vaunted role in moderating U.S. behavior.

But Trump's assertiveness does not imply that the United States will grant China and Russia similar latitude in their regions. Threats to Greenland or intervention in Venezuela do not mean that the United States will allow China or Russia their own spheres of influence. American military power remains decisive in Europe and Asia and will continue to limit Chinese and Russian action even as Trump brooks no opposition to his strategic plans. The United States is also increasing its own power at the expense of collective organizations. The November UN resolution on Gaza granted unprecedented power to the United States by establishing the so-called Board of Peace, chaired by Trump, to oversee the cease-fire and rebuilding process in the enclave. Trump now seeks to expand the board's mandate from Gaza to conflict resolution worldwide, which could potentially undercut the authority of the UN Security Council and further allow Washington to shape the global order.

U.S. hostility toward multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization is pushing other countries to seek multipolarity, but true rebalancing is a long way off. Major economies want to retain access to the U.S. market, still the world's largest, but are simultaneously hedging against U.S. pressure by expanding trade pacts among themselves. Canada, for instance, has signed trade agreements with China and Indonesia and resumed trade talks with India. But these countries will struggle to divorce themselves from the United States. Russia plays a limited role in global trade flows, and China's export-led model makes it an unrealistic destination for others' trade surpluses in the near term. Hopes that China could replace the United States as the world's primary consumption engine remain distant.



Doubts about the reliability of the United States as a security provider are also encouraging U.S. allies in Europe and Asia to strengthen their own defenses. NATO countries have pledged to raise their overall defense spending to five percent of GDP by 2035, and Japan's defense spending has reached its target of two percent of GDP this year. There is high and growing public support in some allied countries, such as South Korea, for developing their own nuclear weapons. Yet building credible conventional and nuclear deterrents will take time. During this transition, these allies will continue to depend on U.S. support and cooperation because neither Tokyo nor Seoul trusts China or Russia to protect their security.

Despite the widespread claims of its imminence, then, multipolarity is nowhere close to being realized. If anything, aspirations of multipolarity have contributed to this new order of unfettered American power. The first Trump administration and the Biden administration identified China and Russia as threats to U.S. dominance, and those two countries have talked up American weakness and been more assertive in their own foreign policies. In his second term, Trump has welcomed the drumbeat heralding the arrival of multipolarity not as a challenge but as a message that the United States no longer needs to be responsible for global order. In Trump's multipolar vision, every country can exercise its power as it sees fit—but given the gaps in market and military power between the United States and everyone else, only Washington gets to exercise its power unconstrained. The United States is outwardly accepting the shared premise of multipolarity but reaping the benefits of continued unipolarity.

The world today has transformed dramatically since the early 1990s, when the Soviet Union collapsed and the United States became the sole superpower. But now, as then, there is little prospect for a credible challenger to U.S. hegemony. The unipolar moment never truly ended; it has merely changed. Unlike just after the end of the Cold War, the United States today feels the need to vigorously assert itself with no qualms about the consequences of exercising its dominance. That is what the Trump administration is doing. And for the foreseeable future, no other country or coalition can stop it.

            •  The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a towering civil rights leader whose moral vision and fiery oratory reshaped the Democratic Party and America, has died at age 84. His son, Jesse Jackson Jr., told CNN that his father's greatest contribution was giving light to people “who found themselves in dark places.”



            • President Donald Trump praised him as “a force of nature like few others before him,” while former President Joe Biden hailed Jackson as “Determined and tenacious. Unafraid of the work to redeem the soul of our Nation.”
    


            • In other tributes, civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton described Jackson as his mentor and “a movement unto himself,” while Bernice King posted a photo of Jackson alongside her father, Rev. Martin Luther King Jr, with the words, “Both now ancestors.”



            Barack Obama has just released a statement on Jesse Jackson's death, writing that he is “deeply saddened to hear about the passing of a true giant.”
    


                    “For more than 60 years, Reverend Jackson helped lead some of the most significant movements for change in human history. From organizing boycotts and sit-ins, to registering millions of voters, to advocating for freedom and democracy around the world, he was relentless in his belief that we are all children of God, deserving of dignity and respect,” he said.
                





            Obamas said that he and his wife Michelle were directly inspired by Jackson, writing: “Michelle got her first glimpse of political organizing at the Jacksons' kitchen table when she was a teenager.”
    


            “And in his two historic runs for president, he laid the foundation for my own campaign to the highest office of the land,” Obama added.
    


                    “Michelle and I will always be grateful for Jesse's lifetime of service, and the friendship our families share. We stood on his shoulders. We send our deepest condolences to the Jackson family and everyone in Chicago and beyond who knew and loved him,' he said.
                





            Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, who grew up with Rev. Jesse Jackson, shared a heartfelt statement reminiscing on their childhoods, calling him “one of the most quintessential civil rights leaders.”
    


                    “Our relationship began as students at rival high schools in South Carolina and continued at rival HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) in the South – he at North Carolina A&T State University and me at South Carolina State University,” Clyburn said. “These rivalries forged a friendship that remain constant and mutually beneficial.”
                





            Jackson's “passion to bring together all creeds is a testament to his vision of unity, oneness, and a nation under one accord,” he wrote.
    


            If we all work together we can change history, the South Carolina lawmaker said, noting the initiatives Jackson worked on including Operation Breadbasket, an organization to improve the economic condition of Black communities across the nation, as well as anti-apartheid activism, voter registration, and corporate diversity.
    


                    “It should not be lost on any of us the impact that Reverend Jackson has had on the nation, Black Americans, and movements to encourage civic participation around the world. His vision is his legacy, and his teachings continue to inspire me as I continue the pursuit of justice and equality,” Clyburn said.
                





            Former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. described his father today as a “unique in American history.”
    


                    “He had spirit-energy, and even today, when the President of the United States referred to him as a force of energy and nature, make no mistake about it, Jesse Jackson was unique in American history. And I hope that his legacy lives on a new generation of Americans,” Jackson Jr. said in an emotional interview with Wolf Blitzer and Pamela Brown on CNN's “Situation Room.”
                





            The former Illinois lawmaker was referring to President Donald Trump's statement about the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who died today at age 84.
    


            Jackson Jr. said his father's greatest contribution in his activism was giving light to people “who found themselves in dark places” by spending tangible time with those in the margins of society.  Following the work of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, Jackson “did the best he could to keep that flame alive,” his son added.
    


            “He saw himself as a public servant. He believed in servant leadership. He saw himself as a seminarian. He saw politics as a way to carry out the ministry of feeding the hungry, of clothing the naked, of providing health care … of providing food,” Jackson Jr. said.
    


            Jackson was troubled by rising polarization, his son emphasized. One of Jackson's final communications with Trump was about “spirit, energy” and the “challenge before the President of the United States to bring all Americans together,” Jackson Jr. said, noting that he believed his father's relationship with Trump had the potential to strike a different tone.
    


            “Unfortunately, he was never the recipient of a return phone call from the President of the United States. But it's never too late. It's never too late to do right. My father sincerely believes that,” Jackson Jr. added.
    


            Omega Psi Phi Fraternity honored Jackson, a 1960 spring initiate of the Pi Psi Chapter, through a video tribute posted to Facebook and X. The posts highlighted Jackson's lifelong commitment to the organization.
    


            Jackson “stands as a towering figure in the global struggle for justice and human dignity,” the post said.
    


            The fraternity also praised his work for the marginalized, claiming his impact as “undeniable.”
    


            “With two groundbreaking presidential campaigns, more than forty honorary doctorates, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, his impact is undeniable. Yet his greatest legacy lives in the hope he has carried for the marginalized, the oppressed, and the unheard.”
    


            Bill and Hillary Clinton are the latest US politicians to pay tribute to Rev. Jesse Jackson, remembering him as someone who “championed human dignity and helped create opportunities for countless people to live better lives.”
    


            The former president and secretary of state said they were friends with Jackson for almost 50 years after meeting him in 1977 on the 20th anniversary of Little Rock Central High's integration of nine black students into the then-all-white school.
    


                    “Reverend Jackson never stopped working for a better America with brighter tomorrows,” the Clintons wrote in a statement, adding that “he championed the concerns of Black, Latino, Asian, and lower income white Americans.”
                





            Bill Clinton awarded Jackson the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in 2000.
    


            “Hillary and I loved him very much. Our hearts and prayers go out to Jackie, their children and grandchildren, and all the people across America and around the world who were inspired by his service to humanity.”
    


            Among the tributes pouring in for Rev. Jesse Jackson are messages from several world leaders, who remembered the civil rights leader as a global moral authority.
    


            South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said on social media that Jackson's campaigning against apartheid “was a towering contribution to the global anti-apartheid cause,” adding: “we are deeply indebted to the energy, principled clarity and personal risk with which he supported our struggle and campaigned for freedom and equality in other parts of the world.”
    


                    Ramaphosa added that his country is “sad to bid farewell to a global moral authority who gave voice to struggles within the United States as well as struggles for fundamental human rights and democracy around the world, including our own.”
                





            Kenya's President William Ruto called Jackson a “steadfast voice for justice and human dignity” in a post on X.



                    “Across decades of public life, he challenged the global community to expand opportunity and confront inequality, with courage and moral clarity,” Ruto said, adding that Jackson's “legacy will endure in the causes he advanced and the lives he changed.”
                





            French President Emmanuel Macron, meanwhile, called Jackson's death an “immense loss,” writing on social media that he was “a tireless promoter of civil rights” who “never stopped defending peace, justice and brotherhood.”
    


            Other notable international figures also paid tribute to Jackson, including British Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy, who called him a “pillar of the civil rights movement.”
    


            Nigerian civil rights activist Shehu Sani wrote that Jackson's death marked the “end of an era,” calling him “a trailblazer for civil rights and social justice.”
    


            Jackson's “unwavering dedication to racial equality, justice, freedom and compassion has made a lasting impact on the world,” he said.
    


CNN's Lauren Chadwick contributed to this reporting.



            In 1984, Jesse Jackson spoke at Democratic National Convention, arguing that the party should expand it's coalition to represent the “many patches” of American society.
    

In 1984, Jesse Jackson spoke at Democratic National Convention, arguing that the party should expand it's coalition to represent the ""many patches"" of American society. Jackson died at 84 after a long fight with a neurological disorder.


            In the hours since the announcement of Rev. Jesse Jackson's passing, heartfelt messages of condolences and friendship from prominent US political and civil right figures have been pouring in.
    


            Catch up on what they had to say about the towering civil rights leader here:
    

The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the pioneering civil rights leader and two-time presidential candidate, has died at 84, his family said, leaving behind a legacy that reshaped US politics and expanded the modern movement for racial justice.


            Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson staged campaigns against some of America's biggest companies and Wall Street to increase racial diversity and economic opportunities.
    


            Jackson frequently organized boycotts and economic protests to pressure major companies to hire Black and minority employees and executives, work with Black vendors, and support youth and jobs training programs for minorities.
    


            In 1971, Jackson founded Operation PUSH, an advocacy organization to advance economic development and political action for Black people.
    


            Operation PUSH organized high-profile boycotts during the following decades, including campaigns against Anheuser Busch, Coca-Cola, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Nike. The group secured detailed agreements from many companies to increase Black economic participation.
    


                    “The world of private capital and wealth is very much off limits for us,” Jackson said in a 1997 interview. “At this stage, that is our challenge: to open up the doors and bring down the walls on Wall Street.”
                





            In 2014, Jackson's Rainbow PUSH Coalition targeted the tech industry's lack of diversity. Jackson attended Google and Facebook's shareholder meetings.
    


            Jackson's organization last year joined a boycott of Target after the company rolled back some of its diversity programs.
    


            Bishop William Barber II remembered Rev. Jesse Jackson as “a civil rights leader, a human rights leader (and) a moral leader,” as well as his friend of more than 40 years.
    


            Describing Jackson as a “mighty lion,” Barber told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that the late civil rights activist understood that politics is “about people.”
    


                    “He understood that nonviolence was not not doing something. It was in fact, choosing your weapons. It was choosing the way of love and justice and truth and choosing to confront the system. And he will be remembered as one who was determined,” Barber said.
                





            Barber was arrested alongside Jackson in 2021 during a Capitol Hill protest over voting rights. The pair also participated in other protests, Barber said.
    


            “A few years ago, we walked in Texas for three days. Jesse, though he had some ailments, came and was with us … He was always there,” he said.
    


                    “He'll be remembered for that determination. He'll be remembered for caring about people,” he said, adding, “He'll be remembered as a mighty lion who has helped raise up a whole lot of others.”
                





            Chicago resident Ziff Sistrunk went to the headquarters of Rainbow Push today to pay respects to Rev. Jesse Jackson, saying the civil rights leader helped people such as himself believe “you could be somebody.”
    


                    “Rev. Jackson was the person who told ex-felons, such as myself, 40 years ago that when you come home it's going to be difficult but just tell yourself you are somebody.“The wife, the student who goes through difficulties, Rev. Jackson told us that we were somebody. And guess what we did? We believed it. We actually believed it, people actually believed that you could be somebody,” he said.
                





            “That's what brought me out here this morning,” he added, when interviewed by CNN outside the headquarters of the civil rights organization founded by Jackson.
    


            “Take his words, those simple words, that I am somebody. And if the children in schools, people that are getting shot up, believe in recovery, resilience, just take his simple words, that I am somebody.”
    


            Former President Joe Biden reflected on his decadeslong friendship and collaboration with Rev. Jesse Jackson, regarding him as a “man of God and of the people,” while reminding the public that the drive for equality endures following Jackson's passing.
    


                    “Throughout our decades of friendship and partnership, I've known Reverend Jackson as history will remember him: a man of God and of the people. Determined and tenacious. Unafraid of the work to redeem the soul of our Nation,” Biden said in a statement on X.






            Biden recalled witnessing Jackson's efforts through “tumult and triumph,” with “relentless insistence on what is right and just.” He said Jackson's activism leaves a legacy of fearless influence spanning Americans to presidents.
    


            While Jackson's service was guided by his belief in “the promise of America: that we are all created equal in the image of God and deserve to be treated equally,” Biden noted that the challenge remains to attain that ideal.
    


            “While we've never fully lived up to that promise, he dedicated his life to ensuring we never fully walked away from it either,” Biden said.
    


            Civil rights and personal injury attorney Ben Crump released a statement mourning the life of his longtime friend and mentor.
    


            “Reverend Jackson never stopped pushing America to live up to its promise. He empowered millions to declare, ‘I am somebody,' and expanded the path for leaders of color in politics and public life,” Crump said in a post on X.
    


            He went on to praise Jackson as a figure who shaped him personally while recalling Jackson's march alongside Dr. King as just one of his numerous achievements in pushing for equality.
    


            “Reverend Jackson conceived of a more just and inclusive America, believed in it with unwavering faith, and dedicated his entire life to achieving it –– all while teaching the next generation how to carry the torch forward,” he said in the post.
    


            Crump noted that his legacy will continue through his dedicated service and advancements of the last-half century.
    


            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer hailed Jesse Jackson as a “fearless warrior,” describing him as one of the most prominent figures for change in the world.
    


                    “Jesse Jackson was an icon of the civil rights movement and a fearless warrior for justice for all people. He was one of the most powerful forces for positive change in our country and our world. America is a more equal and just place thanks to his work,” the Democratic leader said in a statement on X.
                





            Schumer offered prayers and recalled lessons of service honoring Jackson's lifelong work. He called upon the public to follow Jackson's footsteps.
    


            Martin Luther King III and his wife Arndrea Waters King called Rev. Jesse Jackson a “living bridge between generations.”
    


            “A towering voice and a devoted servant of justice. Reverend Jackson was more than a civil rights advocate — he was a living bridge between generations, carrying forward the unfinished work and sacred promise of the Civil Rights Movement,” the pair said in a statement.
    


                    Jackson “walked with courage when the road was uncertain, spoke with conviction when the truth was inconvenient, and stood with the poor, the marginalized, and the forgotten when it was not popular to do so,” they continued.
                





            The Kings added that Jackson had faith in the power of action and said that their hearts are with his loved ones, as well as the “countless people whose lives were touched by his ministry and movement.”
    


                    “We honor his extraordinary legacy and lifelong devotion to civil rights and human dignity. May his memory be a wellspring of strength and courage for all who continue the sacred work to which he gave his life,” they said.
                





            The Rev. Jesse Jackson was “a lifelong soldier for justice” and “a transformative leader whose life's work is deeply woven into the history, mission, and enduring impact of our Association and the nation,” the NAACP said in a statement honoring his life.
    


            “As a young organizer in the 1960s, he labored alongside NAACP leaders, spoke at several national conventions, marched with our members, and helped expand the national movement for racial equality into a broad, people-powered coalition demanding systemic change,” the association said.
    


            In a joint statement, the leaders of the NAACP continued: “His work advanced Black America at every turn. He challenged this nation to live up to its highest ideals, and he reminded our movement that hope is both a strategy and a responsibility. His historic run for president inspired millions and brought race to the forefront of American politics.”
    


                    “We honor his legacy by continuing the work he championed: protecting the right to vote, expanding economic opportunity, and fighting for the freedom and dignity of Black people everywhere,” said NAACP Chairman Leon W. Russell, Vice Chair Karen Boykin Towns, and President Derrick Johnson.
                





            The NAACP, founded in 1909, advocates and litigates for the civil rights of Black Americans and works to end race-based discrimination.
    


            Former Vice President Kamala Harris wrote a tribute to Jesse Jackson in a social media post this morning, saying Jackson “let us know our voices mattered. He instilled in us that we were somebody.”
    


                    “Reverend Jackson gave a voice to people who were removed from power and politics,” Harris wrote, adding that Jackson “widened the path for generations to follow in his footsteps and lead.”
                





            The former vice president shared an anecdote about receiving many a “thumbs up or honk of support” while driving around with a “Jesse Jackson for President” bumper sticker during her time in law school.
    


                    “I was proud to partner with and learn from him on this work throughout my career, and I am so grateful for the time we spent together this January. Reverend Jackson was a selfless leader, mentor, and friend to me and so many others,” she wrote.
                





            “Today and every day, we will carry forward his call to “Keep hope alive,”” her post concluded.
    


            Andrew Young, a civil rights leader and former US ambassador to the United Nations, remembered his friend Rev. Jesse Jackson as “always trying to look out for other people.”
    


            Speaking with CNN, Young recounted meeting Jackson for the first time in Selma, Alabama, during a protest.
    


            “Jesse Jackson and I met in Selma. He was still a student,” Young said. People were backed up in a church because the police had pushed them there, according to Young who said, “to keep people from being hurt, I was standing there and I'd been there all day.”
    


                    “He came up to me that night and he said, ‘Look, I can hold this place for you. You really need to go get some sleep.,'” Young said. “I was very grateful. And from then on he was always a young man looking at how he could help somebody.”
                





            After the encounter that night, Young said he talked to Martin Luther King Jr. about Jackson.  “‘I met a young man last night, he's from Chicago. When we go there we need to look him up.'” Young said he told King. “But (Jackson) looked us up.”
    


            Jackson and Young became “good friends” according to the ambassador.
    


            President Donald Trump acknowledged the passing of civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, whom he called “a good man” and “a force of nature like few others before him.”
    


                    “I knew him well, long before becoming President. He was a good man, with lots of personality, grit, and ‘street smarts.' He was very gregarious - Someone who truly loved people!” Trump posted on Truth Social.
                





            Trump also used his history with Jackson and his Rainbow Coalition to defend his character after the president was recently criticized for posting (and then deleting) a racist video.
    


            “Despite the fact that I am falsely and consistently called a Racist by the Scoundrels and Lunatics on the Radical Left, Democrats ALL, it was always my pleasure to help Jesse along the way,” Trump said. He ended the lengthy social media post with condolences to the Jackson family.
    


            “He loved his family greatly, and to them I send my deepest sympathies and condolences. Jesse will be missed!” Trump said.
    


            Back in 1999, Jackson praised Trump, then a real estate developer, at the Rainbow PUSH Coalition Wall St. Project Conference, saying Trump gave them space for the Wall St. project.
    


            However, during Trump's campaign for president in 2016, when he was promoting the idea that then-President Barack Obama was not born in the United States, Jackson criticized Trump, telling Bloomberg Television, Trump “saw a lie as a victory.”
    


            Republican South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, GOP Senator Tim Scott and GOP Senator Lindsey Graham posted statements paying tribute to Jesse Jackson's life following his passing. Jackson was born in Greenville, South Carolina in 1941 to a cotton grader and hairdresser.
    


McMaster announced that he will lower the flags over the state capitol in Columbia, South Carolina, to honor Jackson's memory and legacy. He described Jackson as an “icon” in the civil rights movement.
    


            “A native son of South Carolina, and an icon of the civil rights movement, the Reverend Jesse Jackson was a prominent voice in our nation's political and cultural dialogue. Peggy and I are saddened to learn of his passing,” McMaster said.
    


            Senator Graham offered condolences while commending Jackson as a “larger-than-life figure,” working “to make America live up to its potential.”
    


            “I am sorry to hear of the passing of Reverend Jesse Jackson, a native of South Carolina. He was a larger-than-life figure who passionately pushed for his causes, always striving to make America live up to its potential. He led a long and consequential life, and he will be missed by his family and friends,” Graham wrote on X. “May he Rest in Peace.”
    


            And Sen. Scott expressed his respect for the late civil rights leader, saying “I don't have to agree with someone politically to deeply respect the role Jesse Jackson, a South Carolina native, played in uplifting Black voices and inspiring young folks to believe their voices mattered.”
    


            “Those that empower people to stand taller always leave a lasting mark. Rest in peace,” the South Carolina lawmaker wrote in a post on X.

Live Updates


            • Family not suspects: Nancy Guthrie's adult children and their spouses are not suspects in her February 1 disappearance from her Arizona home, the sheriff said yesterday, calling any suggestion otherwise “cruel.”
    


            • Examining evidence: Investigators are combing through thousands of tips and poring over evidence, including DNA on a glove found two miles from Guthrie's home; unidentified DNA on her property; and a backpack seen in a video of the suspect. The sheriff hopes DNA test results will come back today, he said.
    


            • No leading theory: Authorities have said they believe the 84-year-old mother of “Today” anchor Savannah Guthrie was removed from the home against her will. But investigators still have no leading theory about a motive, a source said.
    


            • Tip lines: If you have information that could help investigators, you can call 1-800-CALL-FBI or 520-351-4900. You can also submit information at tips.fbi.gov.
    


            Nancy Guthrie's family members are not suspects in her disappearance, the sheriff said, as authorities continue to comb through thousands of tips and analyze DNA in an attempt to identify the suspect and find the missing 84-year-old.
    


            Here's what we know:
    


            Investigators are awaiting the results of DNA tests on the glove found about two miles from Nancy Guthrie's property, and Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said he is hopeful the results could come back today.
    


            The glove appears to match the one worn by the suspect seen in front doorbell camera footage at the home, the FBI said.
    


            Investigators are running the DNA from the glove through the CODIS national database to check for a match with known offender profiles.
    


            Authorities will also compare the glove DNA to DNA recovered at Guthrie's home, which they said does not match her or anyone in her immediate circle.
    


            That could be a significant development in the investigation, but experts caution that the results may not be announced to the public immediately.
    


            Law enforcement experts say authorities are more likely to prioritize tracking down the suspect.
    


            CNN's Kate Bolduan speaks with David Kennedy, who helped create technology used to track bluetooth signals from pacemakers, about how it can be used in the search for Nancy Guthrie.
    


            Monday's statement from the Pima County sheriff that said Nancy Guthrie's family members are not suspects in her disappearance is a direct response to so-called “armchair detectives” who have wildly — and sometimes irresponsibly — speculated about the case.
    


            No matter how well-intentioned the online guessing games have been, the chatter has been distracting, at best, and actively harming the investigation, at worst.
    


            “The Guthrie family are victims plain and simple,” Sheriff Chris Nanos said Monday, suggesting claims to the contrary risk revictimizing the family members.
    


            Law enforcement officials previously tried to make this point in private conversations with members of the media, but the family member finger-pointing has been happening mostly in a parallel universe of true-crime influencers and amateur sleuths.
    


            Now that the point has been made publicly, that the family members are not suspects, “let's hope this puts an end to the reckless and malicious nonsense,” a longtime friend of Savannah Guthrie's remarked to CNN. The friend spoke on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.
    


            There has been a yawning gap between what traditional news outlets have been saying about the Nancy Guthrie investigation and what new-media influencers have been saying.
    


            The influencer content has been more raw, more participatory, and more speculative, with commentary often crossing lines that journalists are taught to avoid, partly to avoid libeling innocent people.
    


            The influencer content is also appealing to some viewers and readers for the same reasons it is controversial. And, as a person involved in the Guthrie investigation told CNN last week, there is a recognition that the online energy can be helpful as well as hurtful: “The breakthrough tip could come from anyone, from anywhere.”
    


            As days have turned into weeks, speculation about certain Guthrie family members intensified in online communities, particularly in circles where there is deep ingrained distrust of major media outlets.
    


            Nanos said on Monday that the suggestions about a family member being responsible for Nancy's disappearance have been “cruel.”
    


            Some amateur sleuths who have drawn online crowds with their commentary about the case reacted on Monday by saying, in effect, they were just trying to help. Some also criticized the sheriff for not making the public statement sooner.
    


            The Pima County Sheriff's Department says the Guthrie family are not suspected of wrongdoing in the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie.
    


            CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller explains how investigators would have examined the family before ruling them out.
    


            CNN's Brian Stelter takes a look at the true crime influencers and online sleuths who have faced backlash over their Nancy Guthrie coverage.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","How this photographer captured an image so stunning, people thought it was AI","https://www.cnn.com/world/africa/south-africa-night-photography-kyle-goetsch-spc","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 09:08:59 GMT","


            Sand sprays in all directions as Kyle Goetsch sprints at full pelt across the Namib desert, his stride broken only momentarily as he screams at the stunned group behind him to start running. All the while, the animal stalks ever closer, pale moonlight silhouetting its colossal form.
    


            Yet all is not what it seems. This is not the climax of a blockbuster natural horror film, even if cameras are everywhere. Rather, a nature photographer is hurtling toward the shot of a lifetime.
    


            Goetsch's breathtaking image of a giraffe cresting a sand dune, staring down the barrel of the lens from the center of a hazy pink moon, is among the best in a jaw-dropping bunch of photos that have helped the South African build an impressive social media following.
    


            For some viewers, it's almost too brilliant.
    


            “This is one of the photos that gets most called out for being AI,” Goetsch told CNN.
    


            “I think that's a compliment because it just shows how unique the image is … It's just so rare and unique to get all these elements to align.”
    


This photographer spent 10 years chasing the perfect shot of a rare species. This is how he got it



            While artificial intelligence was totally absent, luck was very much in attendance.
    


            Cape Town-based Goetsch, who runs workshops across southern Africa for budding photographers, had led clients into the world's oldest desert in order to shoot the full moon rising over an old tree atop a dune.
    


            Though aware giraffes were nearby, all plans went out the window during setup when Goetsch turned to see a long-necked giant ­— likely intrigued by the nearby noise — ambling toward the group.
    


            Realizing it would pass directly in front of the low-hanging moon, Goetsch scooped up his camera and tripod to race into position before it was too late.
    


            “You have a very short window to try and capture what, in my mind, was going to be an incredible image and it ended up being that,” he recalled.
    


            “Once we lined it up and I took those first photos, I knew I had them in the bank … You've to seize the day.”
    


            The fact that image qualifies as one of Goetsch's personal favorites, followed closely by those taken when another giraffe arrived to nuzzle the first, is high praise, given the sheer breadth of his eight-year camera roll.
    


            Photography was a stark career change for someone with a PhD in biochemistry, but after so much time spent squinting through microscopes, the University of Cape Town graduate never looked back after seeing the beauty of his hometown through the lens on a trip with a friend in 2018.
    


            Somewhat ironically, Goetsch quickly morphed from an expert on the tiniest molecules to a guru of the skies and stars above, as astrophotography quickly became a passion.
    


            That transition was aided by the career-launching impact of his viral photo that captured the Milky Way looming above the prominent Lion's Head mountain peak in Cape Town, a scene that necessitated five years of fruitless, arduous hikes waiting for various metaphorical stars to align, from the height of the fog to the visibility of the overhanging galaxy.
    


            For all the beauty of South Africa's legislative capital, from the rolling fynbos (hills and plains) of Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden to the bioluminescent marine organisms that occasionally light up the nearby Kogel Bay beach, for Goetsch, few experiences beat the feeling of observing a budding photographer capture their first shot of the stars.
    


            “It's always exciting when you see it's someone's first time — the Milky Way comes up on the back of their screen and you see their faces,” he says.
    


            “I've got people that have been coming with me for seven or eight years now, and I've seen them grow. That's extremely rewarding for me as a photographer.”
    


            Goetsch's tutoring role is eased by the clarity with which the stars can often be seen from Cape Town and wider South Africa.
    


            In 2023, the country's tourism board published a 10-year national strategy outlining plans to become a world leader in astro-tourism, spurred by its relative scarcity of light pollution, favorable position in relation to various constellations (such as the Southern Cross and Mensa) and abundance of meteorite impact craters.
    


            It's already reaping rewards. In September 2025, Lapalala Wilderness Nature Reserve in Limpopo Province was designated as South Africa's first International Dark Sky Park by DarkSky, a nonprofit fighting against light pollution to preserve the quality of the night sky.
    


            Goetsch has worked on several occasions with the team at the Southern Africa Large Telescope (SALT) near Sutherland, in the Northern Cape, often being granted special access to shoot the observatories — and other gawking photographers — at night.
    


            “It's absolutely incredible to see these dark skies with the people sitting inside there taking pictures of the sky and, at the same time, you taking pictures of them,” Goetsch said. “It's quite surreal.”
    


            If there's a new moon in the sky, you can almost guarantee Goetsch will be somewhere pointing his lens toward it. Every star-spattered image he captures is another step toward his goal of showcasing southern Africa as a night photography paradise.
    


            “We see a lot of the Northern hemisphere photos of the Milky Way,” he explained, “So I really try and incorporate well-known locations or something that's very unique to southern Africa.”
    


            “I think we have one of the best places in the world to do night photography or astrophotography. Compared to the Northern hemisphere with a lot of light pollution, we're really lucky here … I'm so incredibly blessed to live in such a beautiful place.”

Live Updates


            • Iran talks: While “progress was made” during today's discussions in Geneva, the US expects to receive detailed proposals from the Iranian government in the next two weeks to address gaps between their positions, US officials said. Iran's foreign minister said the two sides agreed on “guiding principles” for talks, but more work is needed.
    


            • Russia-Ukraine talks: Discussions aimed at resolving Russia's war in Ukraine are also taking place in Geneva. They are happening as Ukraine accuses Russia of launching a large combined attack on its energy infrastructure overnight into today.
    


            • Back in Washington: The Department of Homeland Security remains shut down over the bitter policy fight on immigration reforms. Democrats have sent a counteroffer to the White House, a spokesperson for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told CNN.
    


            Talks between Russia and Ukraine have ended between the two sides' political negotiators, a source within Ukraine's delegation told CNN on Tuesday. Military negotiators are still meeting, however.
    


            The source added that both groups will reconvene tomorrow morning, with statements expected from the negotiating parties once talks conclude.
    


            Shortly afterwards, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported that talks had ended after four and a half hours.
    


            The US expects to receive detailed proposals from the Iranian government to address gaps in the positions of the two countries following talks in Geneva today, US officials said.
    


                    “Progress was made, but there are still a lot of details to discuss. The Iranians said they would come back in the next two weeks with detailed proposals to address some of the open gaps in our positions,” one US official said.
                





            The readout appeared positive, but it comes as the US military continues to build up its posture in the Middle East. President Donald Trump has warned Iran of a “very traumatic” outcome if they don't agree to a deal in the coming weeks.
    


            The Iranians have indicated through intermediaries leading up to the talks that they could move some of their uranium stockpiles to Russia and that they would be open to economic deals with the US as part of a new nuclear agreement, but it's unclear if those specific issues came up at the talks on Tuesday, sources said.
    


            The Iranians have also signaled that they would be open to halting enrichment for a period, but have said that a permanent ban on enrichment is unacceptable, sources said.
    


            While his negotiators hash out foreign policy in Geneva, President Donald Trump has three events on his public schedule for this afternoon, none of which are open to press.
    


            We'll let you know if we get any updates.
    


            As talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine proceed in a Geneva hotel, Kyiv's mayor says that over 1,000 residential buildings there still lack heat due to Russian attacks on a power plant.
    


            According to Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko, 1,100 residential buildings in Ukraine's capital lack heat due to “critical damage” sustained at a nearby power plant. Klitchko said that 2,600 buildings have had heat restored after an attack on February 12.
    


            It is currently around 16 degrees Fahrenheit in Kyiv.
    


            Russia has frequently attacked Ukrainian energy infrastructure in recent months, forcing Ukrainian energy workers to improvise new safety procedures to make sure the power stays on. In January, an energy worker showed CNN the sandbag-lined steel capsule he's used to take shelter during dozens of attacks on the power plant where he works.
    


            “It's scary, of course,” Oleksandr Adamenko told CNN. “But we overcome our fears and tell ourselves that we have to stay because of the equipment, first and foremost, to keep people warm. Otherwise, who will do it, if not us?”
    


            After Iran's foreign minister said Tehran and Washington had agreed on “guiding principles” for their negotiations, a leading analyst of Iranian affairs has said this would represent progress, if confirmed by the US side.
    


                    “If at least they can agree on what it is that's on the table that they're going to negotiate about, that is a positive development,” Ali Vaez, the Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, told CNN's Becky Anderson.
                





            Vaez cautioned, however, that the “substance” of the negotiations would take far longer than the “scope.” In the talks that led to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, Vaez said “it took two and a half years to negotiate the substance.” Iran's negotiating position is weaker this time, he said, because its nuclear program was severely damaged by US and Israeli strikes in June.
    


                    “Iran's nuclear program is now in ruins, so things that were not possible in 2015 – for instance, Iran agreeing to completely suspend its uranium enrichment – are now facts on the ground. Iran has not spun a single centrifuge in the past seven, eight months. It has not enriched a single gram of uranium in that period. So some of the concessions are now easier for the Iranians,” he said.
                





            Ultimately, Vaez said the success of the talks would depend on whether both sides tempered their demands.
    


                    “If the parties want a limited and achievable agreement, they're going to have a deal. But if they want to go for overreach, they're going to have a war.”
                


                    Ali Vaez
                


            Supporters of Ukraine gathered outside the InterContinental hotel in Geneva, Switzerland, on Tuesday — where peace talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US are currently underway.
    


            Some people outside the venue wore Ukrainian flags and held placards with messages in support of Ukraine. In other parts of the city, protesters held up banners reading “STOP KILLING UKRAINIANS!” and “STOP THE WAR NOW.”
    


            As talks on Iran and Ukraine are happening today overseas, here's the latest on the partial government shutdown back in the US.
    


            Democrats last night sent a counteroffer to the White House on Department of Homeland Security reforms they want to see, a spokesperson for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said.
    


            It comes as negotiations to restore funding to DHS have been moving very slowly, and lawmakers are on a weeklong recess.
    


            Ahead of the counteroffer, Trump said yesterday evening aboard Air Force One that he's willing to meet with Democrats to negotiate lapsed DHS funding.
    


            Trump told reporters, “I will, but you know, we have to protect our law enforcement, they've done a great job.”
    


CNN's Donald Judd contributed reporting to this post. 



            Iran and the United States agreed in Geneva on “guiding principles” for talks, but more work needs to be done, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Tuesday.
    


            Tehran's top diplomat said that the indirect talks with US special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner were more “serious” than a previous round held earlier in Oman this month, describing them as “positive” but warning that an agreement will not be reached “quickly.”
    


            “We are hopeful that we can get this work done quickly and we are able to spend time on it. But regardless when it comes to the text the work becomes more detailed and harder,” he told state television after a second round of talks concluded with the US in Geneva.
    


            “We have reached understandings on the guiding principles, but the drafting and writing phase of the agreement will be more difficult,” he said, adding that the date for the next round of talks is yet to be set.
    


            Araghchi said the two sides had agreed to prepare draft texts of an agreement and exchange them before the next round of talks.
    


            “Right now we have a much clearer picture of what work needs to happen and what work needs to continue of course both sides still have work to do to get closer together but at least now we have a framework and a clearer path to go on,” he said.
    


            Today's talks between the US, Ukraine and Russia in Geneva, Switzerland are being led by US President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, on the US side.
    


            Vladimir Medinsky, aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin, is leading the Kremlin delegation.
    


            Meanwhile, Ukraine's delegation is being led by Kyiv's chief negotiator Rustem Umerov.
    


            Umerov said Friday he would be joined by several other officials, including Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine's presidential chief of staff, and Andriy Hnatov, the head of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
    


            These photos have been released by Ukraine's National Defense and Security Council, showing the peace talks now taking place at the InterContinental hotel in Geneva, Switzerland.
    


            The US delegation, led by Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner, can be seen at the head of the table, with the Ukrainian delegation on their left and the Russian delegation to their right. Several small bunches of flowers decorate each table, and three large bouquets sit in the middle of the room.
    


            The flags of all three countries, in addition to the Swiss flag, stand behind the Americans.
    


            A little over a mile separates today's two hubs of diplomacy in Geneva. Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff spent the morning locked in talks with Iranian officials at the Omani consulate, and are now at the InterContinental hotel for negotiations with Russia and Ukraine.
    


            Holding two sets of high-stakes negotiations back-to-back is an unusual diplomatic arrangement, according to a former diplomat.
    


            “It is not unusual for secretaries of state, or other senior officials with a span of responsibilities, to deal with many different issues in a single trip,” Daniel Fried, the former US ambassador to Poland, told CNN. “It is unusual for special envoys or negotiators to be dual-hatted like this.”
    


            Fried, who also served as the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs under former President George W. Bush, warned that problems can mount if overstretched envoys are not backed up by teams of experts. “The combination of dual-hatted people who may not be adequately staffed, and who don't have – it's not their fault – but cannot be expected to have a mastery of the details, could lead to problems,” he said.
    


            Rather than this being an instance of the Trump administration making the most efficient use of its diplomatic resources, Fried said it is clear that the president trusts his son-in-law and special envoy to achieve results more than others in his administration.
    


            “But the bottom line is, you have to judge by the results,” he said. “So far, the results are impressive with respect to the Ukrainians and the Europeans” – in terms of the concessions Washington has been able to exact – “and unimpressive with respect to the Russians, who have given nothing.”
    


            Iran's delegation attending talks with the US in Geneva today will head back to Tehran tonight, an Iranian official told CNN.
    


            The second round of negotiations concluded in the Swiss city a short while ago.
    


            Iran will close parts of the Strait of Hormuz today for what it said were safety reasons as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps conducts naval exercises, according to Iranian media.
    


            The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the exercises – which come as the US is increasing its own military assets in the region – would simulate “real maritime threats.”
    


            Iran's semi-official news agency Fars said the closure would be “for a few hours” in order to “observe safety and navigation protocols” in the strait.
    


            The naval drills come as the US and Iran resume indirect talks in Geneva, Switzerland aimed at resolving their long-running dispute over Iran's nuclear program.
    


             The Strait of Hormuz is located between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, and is the only way to ship crude from the oil-rich Persian Gulf to the rest of the world. Iran controls its northern side.
    


            About 20 million barrels of oil, or one-fifth of daily global production, flow through the strait every day, according to the US Energy Information Administration, which calls the channel a “critical oil chokepoint.” Iranian officials have previously threatened to close the strait in the face of tensions with the West, a scenario that would massively disrupt global shipping.
    


CNN's Anna Chernova contributed reporting.



            Russia launched another series of attacks on Ukraine this morning, local officials said, hours before today's three-way talks aimed at resolving Russia's war in Ukraine began.
    


            Six civilians were injured in a Russian attack on the country's northern Sumy region, with buildings and cars also damaged, according to Oleh Hryhorov, head of the region's military administration.
    


            Meanwhile, at least three people were injured in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson due to the Russian attacks, local authorities said.
    


            A Russian drone attack on a car in Donetsk region, which was transporting employees of a power plant to work, killed three people today, Ukraine's ministry of energy said.
    


            Ukraine said Tuesday it had hit Russia's Ilsky oil refinery – among the largest in the country's south – in an overnight strike. “The target was hit, causing a fire on the premises,” the General Staff of Ukraine said in a statement Tuesday.
    


            Today's talks are the third such round of negotiations seeking to reach a peace deal to end almost four years of war.
    


            Jared Kushner, Donald Trump's son-in-law, and Steve Witkoff, the US president's special envoy, have just wrapped talks with Iranian officials and will soon begin discussions with delegates from Russia and Ukraine.
    


            Last night, Trump told reporters that he would be involved in the talks “indirectly.” Here's the latest:
    


• Iran talks: A second round of US-Iran nuclear talks began this morning in Geneva, Switzerland. The talks are aiming to curb Iran's nuclear program – potentially in exchange for the US lifting sanctions – and reduce tensions between the two countries.
    


• First round: The last round of talks, held in Oman on February 6, marked the first diplomatic engagement between the two sides since the US and Israel struck Iran last summer. Iranian officials said the Oman meeting had been a “good start.”
    


• Iran's demands: Iran has restated that it wants to enrich uranium for civilian purposes, but the US and its allies warn that the regime could use the purified fuel to make a bomb. In exchange for sanctions relief, Iran has offered to place checks on its program to ensure its uranium does not reach weapons-grade purity.
    


• US demands: Not content merely to secure curbs on Iran's nuclear program, the US is also seeking to include Iran's ballistic missiles and its regional proxies – including Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza – in any future agreement. Iran has previously rejected these attempts, and it is not yet clear what progress was made on Tuesday.
    


• Russia-Ukraine talks: This afternoon, Witkoff and Kushner have pivoted to another thorny dispute, taking part in trilateral talks with Russia and Ukraine aimed at ending the nearly four-year war. Those talks are also taking place in Geneva.
    


            Today's talks between Ukraine, Russia and the United States in Geneva have begun, according to Russian state media RIA.
    


            As the talks started, Kyiv's chief negotiator Rustem Umerov thanked the US for its “involvement and consistent work in the negotiation process.”
    


                    “We are working constructively, with focus and without exaggerated expectations. Our task is to advance as much as possible those decisions that can bring about lasting peace,” Umerov said in a statement.
                





            Russia's delegation has arrived at the Hotel Intercontinental in Geneva, where this afternoon's trilateral talks aimed at ending Russia's war in Ukraine are expected to take place, Russian state news agency TASS said.
    


            The delegation – which will be led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky – touched down in Geneva early Tuesday morning, Russian state media said earlier.
    


            The trilateral Russia-Ukraine-US talks are due to last two days.
    


            The second round of indirect negotiations between the United States and Iran in Geneva, Switzerland, has ended, Iran's semi-official Students' News Agency (ISNA) reported, adding that delegations from both sides have left the venue.
    


            While we await news from the talks taking place between the US and Iran in Geneva today, let's look at reaction to what's happening on the ground in Iran.
    


            The son of the country's last shah called Sunday for “humanitarian intervention” by the US following a brutal crackdown on protests against the regime, as President Donald Trump considers military strikes on the country.
    


            Reza Pahlavi said the Iranian people want “freedom,” and he urged the world to increase pressure on the regime. He spoke a day after addressing a mass demonstration in Germany, where he was attending the Munich Security Conference.
    


            “As we speak, there are people that are being executed in Iran. There are people that are being arrested and tortured,” Pahlavi told Fox News in an interview.
    


                    “That's why an intervention is so necessary. … This intervention is a humanitarian intervention to save lives that will otherwise also continue to be lost.”
                





            At least 6,490 protesters have been killed in Iran since mass demonstrations erupted in late December, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) reported as of last Wednesday. CNN cannot independently verify HRANA's figures.
    


            “What's happening, this is really on a scale (that is) unimaginable,” said Pahlavi.
    


            Pahlavi, who is based in the US, has sought to position himself as a de facto leader of the protesters who staged the most potent challenge to the Islamic Republic in years. Some chanted his name and held signs bearing his image.
    


            Former negotiators who represented the US and Iran told CNN that despite the tensions, an agreement between the countries remains achievable if the Islamic Republic offers firm guarantees to suspend its nuclear program.
    


            Rob Malley, a former US official who was a lead negotiator on the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, told CNN that a “short-term, fragile arrangement” is theoretically possible – one that could give both sides “a victory.”
    


            Under the agreement with the Obama administration, Iran's uranium enrichment and number of centrifuges were limited without completely eliminating the program.
    


            After strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities last year, decades of crippling economic sanctions and the deterioration of its regional proxies, Iran has weakened - giving Trump an opportunity to extract commitments from Tehran that it will indefinitely suspend enrichment or face further military action.
    


            “Iran could make the case that its suspension was born of necessity, given the June (2025) strikes and the unsafe state of its nuclear program and claim that it needs time before being able to resume enrichment.”
    


            “For its part, the US would maintain that it has preserved its position that Iran should never enrich on its soil. … Both sides could describe it as a victory of sorts: Iran, by pointing to the fact that it has not relinquished the right to enrich and the US by boasting that President Trump had achieved what neither Obama nor Biden could, which is a halt to Iranian enrichment.”
    


            Seyed Hossein Mousavian, a former Iranian diplomat who served as the spokesman for Iran during its nuclear negotiations with the European Union from 2003 to 2005, told CNN that conditions now are “very different” from the past but are “more favorable” for a deal where the Islamic Republic would provide firm guarantees that it will permanently remain as a non-nuclear weapon state.
    


            “Iran's current negotiations are centered on survival and the preservation of its territorial integrity and national sovereignty. In this regard, Iran will under no circumstances bargain away its defensive deterrence capabilities,” Mousavian said.
    


            Malley added, “Of course, whether President Trump is open to a nuclear-only deal, or will insist that it covers ballistic missiles, Iran's regional partners, or even its domestic policies, is a whole other matter.”

MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — The Australian government will not repatriate from Syria a group of 34 women and children with alleged ties to the militant Islamic State group, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Tuesday.

The women and children from 11 families were supposed to fly from Syria to Australia, but Syrian authorities on Monday turned them back to Roj detention camp because of procedural problems, officials said.

Only two groups of Australians have been repatriated with government help from Syrian camps since the fall of the Islamic State group in 2019. Other Australians have also returned without government assistance.

Albanese would not comment on a report that the latest women and children had Australian passports.

“We're providing absolutely no support and we are not repatriating people,” Albanese told Australian Broadcasting Corp. in Melbourne.

“We have no sympathy, frankly, for people who traveled overseas in order to participate in what was an attempt to establish a caliphate to undermine, destroy, our way of life. And so, as my mother would say, ‘You make your bed, you lie in it,'” Albanese added.

In his remarks, Albanese was referring to the IS militants' capture of wide swaths of land more than a decade ago that stretched across a third of Syria and Iraq, territory where the extremists established their so-called caliphate. 

At the height of its control, IS declared the city of Raqqa its capital, with jihadis from foreign countries traveling to Syria to join the IS. Over the years, they had families and raised children there. 

Opposition leader Angus Taylor demanded Albanese explain whether his government had considered banning the Australians from returning. So-called temporary exclusion orders enable a government minister to prevent high-risk citizens located overseas from returning to Australia for up to two years.

“These are individuals who chose to associate with a terrorist caliphate. This is not aligned with the values we as Australians believe in — democracy, the rule of law, our basic freedoms including freedom of religion,” Taylor told reporters.




“The door must be shut to people who do not believe in those things,” Taylor added.

Asked about using temporary exclusion orders in this case, Albanese did not directly answer. “What we will do on national security issues is we deal with it appropriately upon advice” of security agencies, Albanese told reporters.

Albanese noted that the child welfare-focused international charity Save the Children had failed to establish in Australia's courts that the Australian government had a responsibility to repatriate citizens from Syrian camps.

After the federal court ruled in the government's favor in 2024, Save the Children Australia chief executive Mat Tinkler argued the government had a moral, if not legal, obligation to repatriate families.

Albanese said if the latest group made their way to Australia without government help, they could be charged.

Under Australian law, it was an offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison to travel to Raqqa in Syria and elsewhere in the caliphate without a legitimate reason from 2014 to 2017. 

“It's unfortunate that children are impacted by this as well, but we are not providing any support. And if anyone does manage to find their way back to Australia, then they'll face the full force of the law, if any laws have been broken,” Albanese added.

The Islamic State group was defeated by a U.S.-led coalition in Iraq in 2017, and in Syria two years later, but IS sleeper cells still carry out deadly attacks in both countries. During the battles against IS, thousands of extremists and tens of thousands of women and children linked to them were taken to detention camps. 

Manager Hakmiyeh Ibrahim of the Roj camp in northeastern Syria told The Associated Press that relatives of the Australians said the Australian government had prepared the camp residents' passports and travel paperwork and suggested that their families collect those documents.

The last group of Australians to be repatriated from Syrian camps arrived in Sydney in October 2022.

They were four mothers, former partners of Islamic State supporters, and 13 children.

Australian officials had assessed the group as the most vulnerable among 60 Australian women and children held in Roj camp, the government said at the time.

Eight children of two slain Australian IS fighters were repatriated from Syria in 2019 by the conservative government that preceded Albanese's center-left Labor Party administration.

The issue of IS supporters resurfaced in Australia after the killings of 15 people at a Jewish festival at Bondi Beach on Dec. 14 — attackers allegedly inspired by IS.

Some countries are repatriating their citizens with alleged IS links from Syria while others are not. Iraq has repatriated most of its citizens, who accounted for the largest number of detainees, after Syrians. The United States, Germany, Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Canada have all repatriated citizens from Syrian camps.

Last year, families repatriated from Roj camp included German, British and French nationals.

Separately, thousands of accused IS militants who were held in detention centers in northeastern Syria have been transferred to Iraq by the U.S. military to stand trial there.

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — The Dolphins released star receiver Tyreek Hill on Monday, ending the All-Pro's four-year tenure in Miami.

Hill, who turns 32 on March 1, is recovering from a season-ending injury suffered in a game against the New York Jets on Sept. 29 that required surgery to repair significant damage to his left knee, including a torn anterior cruciate ligament.

It is one of several major roster cuts the Dolphins made on Monday. Miami also cut offensive lineman James Daniels and receiver Nick Westbrook-Ikhine, and will release two-time Pro Bowl pass rusher Bradley Chubb.

The Dolphins acquired Hill in a trade with Kansas City ahead of the 2022 season and gave him a $120 million, four-year contract extension that made him the highest-paid player at his position at the time.

His contract, which runs through 2026, would have represented around $51 million against Miami's cap.

“These past few years have been some of the most meaningful of my life and career,” Hill said in an Instagram post Monday afternoon.

Hill had consecutive 1,700-yard receiving seasons in his first two years with Miami, including a league-leading 1,799 yards and 13 touchdowns in 2023. The five-time All-Pro entered the 2025 season aiming to regain that elite form after a relatively down year in 2024, when he had 81 catches for 959 yards — his lowest totals in both categories since 2019. 

He had 21 receptions for 265 yards before he was hurt while making a catch in Miami's Week 4 win against the Jets. Hill was running toward the sideline and planted his left foot, and his knee twisted as he was getting pulled down. He was carted off the field and placed on season-ending injured reserve on Oct. 1.




Hill's Dolphins tenure was characterized by tremendous production on the field coupled with numerous rocky moments off the field, including an altercation with police outside of Hard Rock Stadium ahead of the 2024 season opener, and pulling himself from that season's finale and later indicating he wanted to play elsewhere.

In an October podcast interview, Hill, who has played 10 NFL seasons, said he was undecided on whether he plans to retire when he's done rehabbing his injury, but on Monday he indicated on social media that he's not done playing yet.

“The Cheetah don't slow down. Ever,” Hill said in the post. “So to everyone wondering what's next...just wait on it. The Cheetah will be back...Born Again.”

Chubb spent the past three seasons with the Dolphins after being traded to Miami from Denver in 2022. 

He suffered a gruesome knee injury late in the 2023 season that required surgery to fix a torn anterior cruciate ligament, meniscus and patellar tendon in his right knee and sidelined him all of 2024. Chubb had 11 sacks — the most he had in a season since getting 12 as a rookie in 2018 — in 2023 before the injury.

Last season, Chubb's 8 1/2 sacks led the team. He represented a $31 million cap hit for 2026.

New general manager Jon Eric Sullivan, who was hired by the Dolphins last month along with head coach Jeff Hafley, was expected to begin making moves to overhaul Miami's roster.

“We will move with responsible aggression here,” Sullivan said when the Dolphins introduced him on Jan 22. “We will utilize every avenue of player acquisition to bolster this roster.”

Sullivan still faces the question on whether to move on from 2020 first-round pick Tua Tagovailoa, who was benched by former Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel toward the end of last season because of poor play.

Tagovailoa signed a four-year, $212.4 million extension in July 2024, but has since shown a decline in accuracy and mobility. Tagovailoa finished 2025 with 15 interceptions, second most in the NFL and a career high.

He is guaranteed $54 million for 2026, and the Dolphins would incur significant hits to the salary cap by releasing him. Cutting him would result in a $99 million dead cap charge. If the move is designated as a post-June 1 release, those charges are split over two years, with $67.4 million allocated to the 2026 cap and $31.8 million in 2027. 

Sullivan said last week at a fan event that he doesn't know “what the future holds right now.”

“And I told Tua that,” Sullivan said. “We're working through some things. What I can tell you is that we're going to infuse competition into that room — whether Tua is part of the room, whether he's not part of the room.”

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán on Monday during his visit to Budapest. The pair were set to hold talks and sign a civilian-nuclear cooperation agreement heralded by U.S. President Donald Trump.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday enthusiastically endorsed Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's bid to serve a fifth straight term after upcoming elections in April, emphasizing during a visit to Budapest the strong personal relationship between the nationalist leader and U.S. President Donald Trump.

BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday enthusiastically endorsed Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán ‘s bid to serve a fifth straight term after the April elections, emphasizing during a visit to Budapest the strong personal relationship between the nationalist leader and U.S. President Donald Trump. 

Orbán, who has led Hungary since 2010, is one of Trump's most vocal supporters in the European Union, and has actively curried the U.S. president's favor leading up to the April 12 vote in which he will face the toughest challenge of his last 16 years in power. 

Rubio was in the Hungarian capital for meetings with Orbán and his government where he signed an agreement on U.S.-Hungarian civilian nuclear cooperation that includes the possible purchase of compact nuclear reactors — known as small modular reactors or SMRs — as well as U.S.-supplied nuclear fuel and spent fuel storage technology.

At a news conference, Rubio said U.S.-Hungary relations — which both he and Orbán described as experiencing a “golden age” under Trump — go beyond mere diplomatic cooperation. 

“I'm going to be very blunt with you,” Rubio said. “The prime minister and the president have a very, very close personal relationship and working relationship, and I think it has been beneficial to our two countries.” 

“That person-to-person connection that you've established with the president has made all the difference in the world in building this relationship,” Rubio continued, addressing Orbán. “President Trump is deeply committed to your success because your success is our success.”




Rubio's stop in Hungary followed a visit to Slovakia on Sunday after he previously attended the Munich Security Conference in Germany. 

Led by euroskeptic populists who oppose support for Ukraine and vocally back Trump, Slovakia and Hungary are both friendly territory for Rubio in his push to shore up energy agreements with both Central European countries. 

Widely considered Russian President Vladimir Putin's most reliable advocate in the EU, Orbán has maintained warm relations with the Kremlin despite its war against Ukraine while building ties with Trump and his MAGA — short for the 2016 Trump campaign slogan “Make America Great Again” — movement.

Orbán has remained firmly committed to purchasing Russian energy despite efforts by the EU to wean off such supplies, and received an exemption from U.S. sanctions on Russian energy after a November meeting in the White House with Trump. 

Rubio would not specify on Monday how long that exemption would last as the EU plans to phase out Russian fossil fuels entirely by the end of 2027. 

Apparently trusting that his political and personal affinity with Trump could pay even greater dividends, Orbán and his government have sought to woo the U.S. leader to Hungary before the pivotal April elections — hoping such a high-profile visit and endorsement would push Orbán, who is trailing in most polls, over the finish line. 

On Monday, Orbán told Rubio that his government is ready to host any future trilateral peace summit among the United States, Russia and Ukraine, and that Trump has an “open invitation” to Budapest. 

He also claimed that Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, were seeking to interfere in Hungary's elections by criticizing Orbán's opposition to providing weapons or financial aid to Kyiv and threats to block Ukraine's eventual membership in the EU. 

Many in MAGA and the broader conservative world view Hungary as a shining example of successful conservative nationalism, despite the erosion of its democratic institutions and its status as one of the EU's poorest countries. 

Orbán has riffed on Trump's popular slogan and declared that he and his movement seek to “Make Europe Great Again.” 

In turn, Trump has praised Orbán's firm opposition to immigration, exemplified by a fence his government erected on Hungary's southern border in 2015 as hundreds of thousands of refugees fled Syria and other countries in the Middle East and Africa. 

Other U.S. conservatives admire Orbán's hostility to LGBTQ+ rights. His government last year banned the popular Budapest Pride celebration and allowed facial recognition technology to be used to identify anyone participating despite the ban. It has also effectively banned same-sex adoption and same-sex marriage, and disallowed transgender individuals from changing their sex in official documents.

Budapest has hosted several annual iterations of the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, and another was hastily rescheduled this year to fall in March, just before Hungary's elections.

By EMMA BURROWS, EVGENIY MALOLETKA and KWIYEON HA

February 17, 2026


Growing up in a village in northern Greenland, Jørgen Kristensen's closest friends were his stepfather's sled dogs. Most of his classmates were dark-haired Inuit; he was different. When he was bullied at school for his fair hair — an inheritance from the mainland Danish father he never knew — the dogs came to him.



He first went out to fish on the ice with them alone when he was 9 years old. They nurtured the beginning of a life-long love affair and Kristensen's career as a five-time Greenlandic dog sled champion.



“I was just a small child. But many years later, I started thinking about why I love dogs so much,” Kristensen, 62, told The Associated Press.



“The dogs were a great support,” he said. “They lifted me up when I was sad.”



For more than a thousand years, dogs have pulled sleds across the Arctic for Inuit seal hunters and fishermen. But this winter, in the town of Ilulissat, around 300km (186 miles) north of the Arctic Circle, that's not possible.



Instead of gliding over snow and ice, Kristensen's sled bounces over earth and rock. Gesturing to the hills, he said it's the first time he can remember when there has been no snow — or ice in the bay — in January.



The rising temperatures in Ilulissat are causing the permafrost to melt, buildings to sink and pipes to crack but they also have consequences that ripple across the rest of the world.



The nearby Sermeq Kujalleq glacier is one of the fastest-moving and most active on the planet, sending more icebergs into the sea than any other glacier outside Antarctica, according to the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO. As the climate has warmed, the glacier has retreated and carved off chunks of ice faster than ever before — significantly contributing to sea levels that are rising from Europe to the Pacific Islands, according to NASA.



The melting ice could reveal untapped deposits of critical minerals. Many Greenlanders believe that's why U.S. President Donald Trump turned their island into a geopolitical hotspot with his demands to own it and previous suggestions that the U.S. could take it by force.



In the 1980s, winter temperatures in Ilulissat regularly hovered around -25 Celsius (-13 Fahrenheit) in winter, Kristensen said.



But nowadays, he said, there are many days when the temperature is above freezing — sometimes it can be as warm as 10 Celsius (50 Fahrenheit.)



Kristensen said he now has to collect snow for the dogs to drink during a journey because there isn't any along the route.



Although Greenlanders have always adapted — and could make dog sleds with wheels in future — the loss of the ice is affecting them deeply, said Kristensen, who now runs his own company showing tourists his Arctic homeland.



“If we lose the dog sledding, we have large parts of our culture that we're losing. That scares me,” he told AP, pressing his lips together and becoming tearful.



In winter, hunters should be able to take their dogs far out on the sea ice, Kristensen told AP. The ice sheets act like “big bridges,” connecting Greenlanders to hunting grounds but also to other Inuit communities across the Arctic in Canada, the United States and Russia.



“When the sea ice used to come, we felt completely open along the entire coast and we could decide where to go,” Kristensen said.



This January, there was no ice at all.



Driving a dog sled on ice is like being “completely without boundaries — like on the world's longest and widest highway,” he said. Not having that is “a very great loss.”



Several years ago, Greenland's government had to provide financial support to many families in the far north of the island after the sea ice did not freeze hard enough for hunting, said Sara Olsvig, chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Council, which represents Inuit people from across Arctic nations.



The warming weather also makes life more dangerous for fishermen who have swapped their dog sleds for boats, because there is more rain instead of snow, said Morgan Angaju Josefsen Røjkjær, Kristensen's business partner.



When snow falls and is compressed, air is trapped between the flakes, giving the ice its brilliant white color. But when rain freezes, the ice that forms contains little air and looks more like glass.



A fisherman can see the white ice and try to avoid it, but the ice formed from rain takes on the color of the sea – and that's dangerous because “it can sink you or throw you off your boat,” said Røjkjær.



Climate change, Olsvig said, “is affecting us deeply,” and is amplified in the Arctic, which is “warming three to four times faster than the global average.”



Over the course of his lifetime, the Sermeq Kujalleq glacier has retreated by about 40 kilometers (25 miles) said Karl Sandgreen, 46, the head of Ilulissat's Icefjord Center which is dedicated to documenting the glacier and its icebergs.



Looking out of the window at hills which would normally be covered with snow, Sandgreen described mountain rock revealed by melting ice and a previously ice-covered valley inside the fjord where “there's nothing now.” It's unclear, he said, if the town can hold its ice music festival in February — because there might not be any ice or snow.



Pollution is also speeding up the ice melt, Sandgreen said, describing how Sermeq Kujalleq is melting from the top down, unlike glaciers in Antarctica which largely melt from the bottom up as sea temperatures rise.



This is exacerbated by two things: black carbon, or soot spewed from ship engines, and debris from volcanic eruptions. They blanket the snow and ice with dark material and reduce reflection of sunlight, instead absorbing more heat and speeding up melting. Black carbon has increased in recent decades with more ship traffic in the Arctic, and nearby Iceland has periodic volcanic eruptions.



Many Greenlanders told AP they believe the melting ice is the reason Trump — a leader who has called climate change “the greatest con job ever” — wants to own the island.



“His agenda is to get the minerals,” Sandgreen said.



Since Trump returned to office, fewer climate scientists from the U.S. have visited Ilulissat, Sandgreen said. The U.S president needs to “listen to the scientists,” who are documenting the impact of global warming, he said.



Kristensen said he tries to explain the consequences of global warming to the tourists who he takes out on dog sled rides or on visits to the icebergs. He said he tells them how Greenland's glaciers are as important as the Amazon rainforest in Brazil.



International summits, such as the United Nations climate talks in November in the Amazon gateway city of Belem, play a role, but it's just as important to “teach children all over the world” about the importance of ice and oceans, alongside subjects like math, Kristensen said.



“If we don't start with the children, we can't really do anything to help nature. We can only destroy it,” Kristensen said.

Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports on President Donald Trump's stance on Iran on ‘America Reports.'

Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth has ordered Army Secretary Dan Driscoll to remove Col. Dave Butler from his current job serving as chief of Army public affairs and chief advisor to Driscoll, who currently is in Geneva serving on the negotiating team to end the Ukraine war, Fox News has learned. 

Butler served as the head of public affairs for the Joint Chiefs when Gen. Mark Milley was chairman, and was slated to receive his first star. His name appeared for two years in a row on an Army list of 34 officers selected for promotion. 

That list has been held up by Hegseth for nearly four months because he reportedly has concerns about four to five officers selected by the Army board, but by law he cannot remove them from the list. Butler volunteered to take his name off the promotion list if it would help unlock the other promotions, according to an Army official.

Driscoll, an Army veteran and close ally of Vice President JD Vance – he attended Yale Law School with the vice president – had resisted Hegseth's pressure to fire Butler for months because of his ongoing contributions to the transformation of the Army.

""We greatly appreciate COL Dave Butler's lifetime of service in America's Army and to our nation,"" Driscoll said in a statement. ""Dave has been an integral part of the Army's transformation efforts and I sincerely wish him tremendous success in his upcoming retirement after 28 years of service."" 

Butler traveled with Driscoll to Ukraine in November 2025 to help jump-start negotiations.

The demand by Hegseth came Thursday, Fox News has learned.

Hegseth entered the Pentagon in 2025 and immediately began firing top officers or forcing them into early retirement without giving a reason or for cause: Adm. Lisa Franchetti, who was serving as chief of naval operations; Gen. CQ Brown, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Gen. James Mingus, who was serving as vice chief of the Army; Gen. Douglas A. Sims, director of the Joint Staff; Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin; Gen. James Slife, vice chief of the Air Force; and Gen. Timothy Haugh, director of the National Security Agency, among others.

The unexplained firings have led to fear, uncertainty and an unwillingness to speak up among senior military leaders.

FIRED UNDER TRUMP, FORMER MILITARY OFFICERS LAUNCH DEMOCRATIC BIDS FOR CONGRESS

One of the Army's best communicators, Butler served alongside the nation's tiered special operations units on countless missions overseas attached to the Army's Delta Force from 2010 to 2014. 

He served as the public affairs officer to Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, from 2015 to 2018. He worked as the public affairs officer for Gen. Scott Miller when he was Joint Special Operations Command commander from 2016 to 2018, and then, at Miller's request, served in Afghanistan when Miller deployed there from 2018 to 2019.  

Butler served as the chief spokesman and director of communications for all U.S. and NATO forces during that time that Miller served as the top four-star general in Afghanistan.

A former four-star commander who once commanded U.S. Special Operations said Butler was ""the consummate professional, the most competent Public Affairs officer I have ever worked with and a gifted practitioner of strategic communications.""

During the Army's 250th birthday celebrations in 2025, President Donald Trump recognized Butler by name for helping the Army chief to organize the parade in Washington, D.C.

The father of a Georgia teen accused of killing four at Apalachee High School is on trial. Prosecutors say he ignored warning signs and gave his son the gun used in the attack.

A Georgia father went on trial Monday, as he stands accused of enabling the 2024 high school shooting that left two students and two teachers dead by giving his teenage son access to a rifle despite repeated warning signs.

Colin Gray faces nearly 30 felony counts, including second-degree murder, involuntary manslaughter and cruelty to children, in connection with the Sept. 4 attack at Apalachee High School in Winder. Prosecutors argue his decision to arm his son directly led to the killings.

""This is not a case about holding parents accountable for what their children do,"" Barrow County District Attorney Brad Smith told jurors during opening statements. ""This case is about this defendant and his actions in allowing a child that he has custody over access to a firearm and ammunition after being warned that that child was going to harm others.""

Under Georgia law, second-degree murder can apply when someone causes the death of a child while committing cruelty to children — the underlying felony prosecutors allege in this case. Smith told jurors the charges are structured around the victims, tying cruelty-to-children counts to the deaths of the students and reckless-conduct allegations to involuntary manslaughter counts for the slain teachers.

UVALDE TRIAL HALTED AFTER KEY WITNESS CHANGES TESTIMONY

Investigators have said Colt Gray, 14 at the time, brought a semiautomatic rifle to school in his backpack, left class and opened fire in a classroom and hallways. Two school resource officers took him into custody, authorities said.

Defense attorney Brian Hobbs argued the teen hid his plans from his father. 

""You cannot hold someone criminally responsible for failing to predict what was intentionally hidden from them,"" Hobbs said.

Prosecutors pointed to what they described as a pattern of escalating red flags that were not acted upon.

JURY REACHES VERDICT IN TRIAL OF EX-UVALDE SCHOOL POLICE OFFICER ACCUSED OF FAILING TO CONFRONT GUNMAN

In 2021, Colt Gray used a school computer to search ""how to kill your dad,"" Smith said. In May 2023, authorities investigated an online shooting threat traced to a computer at the Gray home after receiving a tip from the FBI. Colt Gray denied making the threat and said his account had been hacked, according to prosecutors. Smith said investigators asked Colin Gray at the time to restrict his son's access to guns.

Despite those incidents, prosecutors allege Colin Gray gave his son the rifle as a Christmas gift later that year and continued buying accessories, including what Smith described as ""a lot of ammunition.""

Smith also told jurors that on the morning of the shooting, Colt's mother called the school after receiving alarming text messages and warned a counselor that her son had access to firearms, prompting administrators to begin searching for him.

FORMER UVALDE SCHOOL OFFICER SAYS HE DOESN'T REGRET ACTIONS AFTER NOT GUILTY VERDICT

Prosecutors have said Colin Gray knew his son was obsessed with school shooters and had received a troubling text weeks before the attack that read: ""Whenever something happens, just know the blood is on your hands.""

An investigator testified that Gray was aware his son's mental health had deteriorated and had sought counseling services.

""This is not a case about holding parents accountable for what their children do,"" Barrow County District Attorney Brad Smith told jurors during opening statements. (Jason Getz/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP)

""We have had a very difficult past couple of years and he needs help. Anger, anxiety, quick to be volatile. I don't know what to do,"" Gray wrote, according to testimony.

Smith told jurors that despite those concerns, Gray did not pursue inpatient treatment for his son.

The trial is being held in Barrow County, where the shooting occurred, with jurors brought in from neighboring Hall County due to pretrial publicity.

Colt Gray is behind bars while awaiting his own trial. Day 2 of testimony in his father's trial will proceed later Tuesday. 

The case is among a growing number nationwide in which prosecutors are seeking to hold parents criminally responsible in deadly school shootings.

Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, discusses the 'SAVE Act,' detailing citizenship proof requirements for voter registration and debunking claims it blocks married women on 'The Will Cain Show.'

North Carolina's elections board came to an agreement with the Republican and Democratic parties on Monday to give 73,000 voters more time to update their voter registrations before they are removed from voter rolls.

The settlement concludes an extended legal battle that rose after the Republican National Committee and North Carolina GOP sued state election officials in 2024, claiming that roughly 250,000 voters had been improperly registered. The voters in question did not provide the last four digits of their Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers or an attestation that they had neither on their registrations.

Republicans had requested that the voters be removed from rolls and their votes in the 2024 elections be thrown out. The Democratic National Committee hailed the settlement as a win on Monday, accusing the GOP of voter suppression.

""This latest victory is a win for Americans and yet another blow to the Republicans' scheme to disenfranchise voters ahead of the midterm elections,"" DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement after the settlement.

The North Carolina State Board of Elections admitted that roughly 100,000 voters lacked proper identification as of last summer. As of December, that number had shrunk to roughly 73,000.

Monday's agreement allows those voters to stay on the voter rolls, with their information to be updated when they cast a ballot. North Carolina law requires voters to show ID when voting.

The settlement comes amid a federal battle over voter ID requirements, with the GOP pushing the Safeguarding American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) America Act, which passed the House last week and is expected to face a vote in the Senate. The bill would impose a blanket requirement for voters to provide proof of citizenship before casting a ballot.

KEY HOUSE COMMITTEE ADVANCES NATIONWIDE VOTER ID BILL, SETTING UP 2026 ELECTION FIGHT

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., vowed Sunday that Senate Democrats will block the effort.

""We will not let it pass in the Senate,"" Schumer told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""We are fighting it tooth and nail. It's an outrageous proposal that is, you know, that shows the sort of political bias of the MAGA right. They don't want poor people to vote. They don't want people of color to vote because they often don't vote for them.""

Schumer's comments came after Tapper pressed him on his opposition, noting that polling shows roughly 83% of Americans support some form of voter identification. That figure comes from a Pew Research poll published last year that found 71% of Democratic voters surveyed supported presenting an ID to vote.

COLLINS BOOSTS REPUBLICAN VOTER ID EFFORT, BUT WON'T SCRAP FILIBUSTER

In addition to ID requirements, the GOP-backed bill would establish a system for state election officials to share information with federal authorities to verify voter rolls. It would also allow the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to pursue immigration cases if noncitizens are found listed as eligible voters.

Democrats have attempted to paint the bill as racist.

""What they are proposing in this so-called SAVE Act is like Jim Crow 2.0,"" Schumer said. ""They make it so hard to get any kind of voter ID that more than 20 million legitimate people, mainly poorer people and people of color, will not be able to vote under this law.""

A Savannah, Georgia elementary school teacher was killed Monday morning in a traffic collision after authorities say a man fleeing federal immigration officers crashed into her vehicle.

The crash happened about 7:45 a.m. on Monday at a busy intersection, according to the Chatham County Police Department. Officers responding to the scene found two vehicles involved. Both drivers were transported to a hospital, where the female driver was pronounced dead. The male driver, identified as 38-year-old Oscar Vasquez Lopez, sustained non-life-threatening injuries.

Savannah-Chatham County Public Schools announced that the victim was Dr. Linda Davis, a teacher at Hesse K-8 School. In a statement, the school district said counselors will be available at the school this week to support students and staff.

""Dr. Linda Davis was a beloved member of our school family and her loss has affected us deeply,"" Hesse K-8 School said in a statement.

The agency said he initially complied with a traffic stop but then fled, making a U-turn and running a red light before colliding with another vehicle.

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called the crash ""an absolute tragedy"" and said fleeing from federal law enforcement is both a crime and dangerous.

""This vehicular homicide is an absolute tragedy and deadly consequence of politicians and the media constantly demonizing ICE officers and encouraging those here illegally to resist arrest—a felony,"" McLaughlin said. ""These dangerous tactics are putting people's lives at risk.

Now, an innocent bystander has lost their life.""

Local police said they were not involved in the federal operation, attempted stop or pursuit and were unaware of the enforcement action until after the crash.

Officers on routine patrol were near the scene and responded almost immediately, authorities said.

A suspect accused of shooting and killing two people at a Rhode Island ice rink on Monday before killing himself was identified as transgender and had a history of past family conflict over his gender identity, a local news outlet reported, citing court documents.

Court records show Robert Dorgan had been involved in multiple disputes with relatives in recent years, including allegations that tensions escalated after he underwent gender reassignment surgery, according to WPRI.

Dorgan, 56, is accused of opening fire inside the Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket during a hockey game between Coventry and Blackstone Valley Schools in what police described as a ""family dispute,"" Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves said at a press conference Monday.

Authorities said two victims were killed and the suspect died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Three others were injured and remain hospitalized.

A federal law enforcement source told Fox News the gunman killed his wife and shot three of his children before turning the gun on himself in what the source described as a domestic violence incident.

In 2020, Dorgan reported to North Providence police that he had undergone gender-reassignment surgery and said his father-in-law wanted him out of the family home because of it. Police identified the suspect by the birth name Robert Dorgan and said he also went by ""Roberta.""

According to court documents cited by WPRI, Dorgan alleged his father-in-law used a derogatory term for transgender individuals and threatened retaliation if he did not move out. The father-in-law was charged at the time, though prosecutors later dismissed the case.

Court filings also show Dorgan's then-wife initially cited ""gender reassignment surgery, narcissistic + personality disorder traits"" in divorce paperwork before the grounds were amended to ""irreconcilable differences."" The divorce was finalized in 2021. Divorce records list Dorgan as living in Jacksonville, Florida, at the time and working as a truck driver.

Also in 2020, Dorgan accused his mother of assaulting him and acting in a ""violent, threatening or tumultuous manner,"" according to police records cited by WPRI. His mother was charged with simple assault and battery and disorderly conduct, though the case was later dismissed, court records show.

The dispute was also referenced in Dorgan's conflict with his father-in-law. According to court documents, Dorgan told police his father-in-law ""told me that if I did not drop the assault charges against my mother that further retaliation could be expected and that was another reason to have me killed.""

Police have not said whether those past disputes were connected to Monday's violence, and investigators have not publicly identified a motive. Goncalves said the shooting ""looked like it was a family dispute"" and that detectives are still working to establish a timeline.

""I spend every night in the village,"" she told NBC. ""It's been everything and more, and you can't evict me,"" she said. ""I don't think there's anything not to enjoy. I haven't even got to compete yet and I feel like my experience is already complete. Not complete, but I'm having a blast. The best time.""

Levito will compete in the short program before the free skate later in the week.

""I feel really good. I feel very trained,"" she added. ""I'm very excited. I feel like I'm in a really good spot. I'm really excited to soak this all in.""

AMERICAN ELANA MEYERS TAYLOR FINALLY CAPTURES GOLD MEDAL AT WINTER OLYMPICS, MAKES TEAM USA HISTORY

Levito, Glenn and Liu are known collectively as the ""Blade Angels,"" which is an homage to ""Charlie's Angels"" after rejecting other suggestions like the ""Powerpuff Girls"" and ""Babes of Glory.""

The 18-year-old was born in Philadelphia but hails from Mount Holly, New Jersey. This year's Olympics are her first appearance.

She took home the gold in women's singles in the 2023 U.S. Championships. She picked up silvers in the 2024 World Championships and the 2022-23 Grand Prix Final.

News anchor Anderson Cooper is ending his tenure on the CBS investigative series 60 Minutes.

After appearing on the program for nearly two decades, Cooper said in a statement announcing his resignation that ultimately he found it impossible to juggle his role at CBS with his job at CNN and his family life.

“Being a correspondent at 60 Minutes has been one of the great honors of my career. I got to tell amazing stories, and work with some of the best producers, editors, and camera crews in the business,” Cooper wrote in a statement about his departure. “For nearly twenty years, I've been able to balance my jobs at CNN and CBS, but I have little kids now and I want to spend as much time with them as possible, while they still want to spend time with me.”

Cooper is among the few high-profile journalists in broadcast television to hold lasting positions at two major networks at the same time. He joined 60 Minutes in 2007, while still maintaining his role as host of Anderson Cooper 360° on CNN.

Despite leaving CBS, Cooper will remain a host on CNN.

It is the latest in a series of shake-ups at the legacy news station since the arrival of Bari Weiss, who took over as editor-in-chief last October.

Under Weiss's leadership, the company has conducted several rounds of layoffs and buy-outs as it attempts to restructure and pivot toward the political center.

Weiss received internal pushback after choosing to hold a 60 Minutes program about conditions in El Salvador's megaprison, CECOT, demanding that reporters get comments from a White House official for the show.

The segment, which detailed inmates' accounts of “torture, sexual and physical abuse inside CECOT, one of El Salvador's harshest prisons,” eventually aired weeks later with few changes to its content.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) had a rough go of things at the Munich Security Conference over the weekend. 

Making her first appearance at Europe's preeminent security summit since being elected to Congress in 2018, Ocasio-Cortez participated in multiple panel discussions, widely seen as a strategic effort to increase her political profile. However, several of her remarks drew much criticism and ridicule, including a response she gave about Venezuela, in which she claimed the country was located “below the equator.”

“We look at what happened in Venezuela, for example,” said Ocasio-Cortez in a discussion at TU Berlin about the state of politics in the United States. “It is not a remark on who Maduro was as a leader. He canceled elections. He was an anti-democratic leader.” 

“That doesn't mean that we can kidnap a head of state and engage in acts of war just because the nation is below the equator,” said Ocasio-Cortez.

However, the congresswoman was mistaken. Venezuela is the northernmost country in South America, located in the Northern Hemisphere and north of the equator. It was one of several remarks by Ocasio-Cortez that were widely panned by critics. Her Venezuela flub drew much mockery and scorn from opponents. 

Journalist Glenn Greenwald was among those who slammed the New York congresswoman.

“Whoever convinced AOC that she had successfully completed her tutoring and was now ready to give book reports about foreign policy in public really should look for another line of work,” Greenwald posted on X. 

“Unless the goal was to sabotage her,” he added. “In which case: kudos for a job well done.”

“AOC's Geography Is as Bad as Her Politics — And That's Saying Something,” said Fox News host Sean Hannity.

“Hey Dummy, Venezuela is, in fact, NOT below the equator,” podcast host Steven Crowder posted on X. “The more you know, @AOC.”

Comedian and talk show host Jimmy Failla ridiculed Ocasio-Cortez about the Venezuela error, while also making fun of her claims about being from the Bronx.

“Nobody is shocked that AOC doesn't know where Venezuela is,” Failla posted on X. “This is the same chick who claims she grew up in the Bronx even though her actual neighborhood of Yorktown Heights is FORTY miles away.”

President Donald Trump also commented about Ocasio-Cortez's Munich performance, saying her comments were “not a good look.”

“I watched AOC answering questions in Munich,” Trump said to a press gaggle on Air Force One on Monday evening. “This was not a good look for the United States.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Marco Rubio's Impressive Speech","https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/marco-rubio-munich/686025/","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 11:00:00 GMT","

The secretary of state sought not only to reassure but to rally Europeans.

Updated at 12:40 p.m. ET on February 17, 2026

As Cabinet members snarl at representatives and senators, and social media fills with semiliterate trolling and insults by public officials, we need to remember that rhetoric—the art of persuasive speech—still matters. Marco Rubio, the U.S. secretary of state, gave an excellent demonstration of that fact at this year's Munich Security Conference.

Any contemporary speech carries the burden of multiple audiences. In this administration, the first and most important is the volatile and tempestuous president. But at Munich, there are other audiences as well: those in the room who represent not only a European but a global national-security elite; European and other politicians outside the room who care chiefly about domestic politics but are aware of international politics; real and potential enemies; and an American audience taking the measure of its country's leaders.

Delivering speeches at Munich is a perilous business. In 2018, Lieutenant General H. R. McMaster gave a podium-thumping address about nuclear proliferation and jihadists. A month later he was sacked; he'd received a tweeted dressing-down in midair on the way back for having acknowledged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Last year, J. D. Vance headed in the other direction—denouncing democratic decay in Europe while calling out errant allies by name. This undiplomatic tirade went over well in the White House, but marked him as a belligerent nativist abroad and something of an isolationist at home. The speech might have elevated his standing with MAGA world, but showed him to be out of the mainstream of American foreign-policy views as measured by consistent polling of what the American people want. Vance's tone was loutish in the distinctive, and tiresome, Trump way.

Rubio's lengthy speech this past weekend was very different. There was nothing in it to offend the president, who was referenced three times, enough to flatter but not so often as to seem to grovel. The phrase sigh of relief was used by Rubio's European host after the speech, and he meant it: The secretary of state received a standing ovation at the Hotel Bayerischer Hof. The American political class, including those on the right, cheered as well. Fox News approvingly noted, “Rubio Fuels 2028 Speculation.”

This reception was not surprising. Rubio is not merely bright and well spoken but a far more experienced politician than anyone else in the Trump Cabinet: He spent eight years in the Florida House of Representatives, including two as the youngest speaker and the first Cuban American to hold that position; served three terms in the Senate with weighty experience on the Foreign Relations Committee and the Select Committee on Intelligence; and now holds the combined roles of national security adviser and secretary of state in the highly personalistic Trump White House.

At 55—older than he looks—Rubio is a politician in his prime. It is highly unlikely that his career is over. He has articulated high principles and shown the occasional streak of ruthlessness and expediency—the latter having landed him in the Cabinet of a man he once despised. In theory, he has indicated his intention to play second fiddle in a Vance administration, but the current vice president would be a fool to take that as the final word. If the slippery turns of politics leave Vance exposed or failing, Rubio will undoubtedly do to him what he did to his mentor Jeb Bush, shunting him to the side with brutal skill. He assuredly wants to be president and might very well end up there.

There is every reason, then, to take his speech seriously and examine it carefully. While keeping Trump onside, Rubio sought not only to reassure but to rally Europeans. Where Vance seems only to have desired to berate and insult, there was something more urgently coaxing in Rubio's tone. He seems to understand that the United States needs allies, that NATO was and should remain a cornerstone of American foreign policy, and he probably knows as well that an alienated Europe is dangerous for the United States. He spoke of our “intertwined destiny” and asserted that “the fate of Europe will never be irrelevant to our own.” In short, he reaffirmed the old saw that the only thing worse than fighting with allies is fighting without them.

His description of the common bonds, however, was predominantly civilizational. He cited poets and authors rather than political thinkers: Shakespeare, Mozart, Michelangelo, and the Beatles got shout-outs, not Montesquieu or John Locke. God appeared once, Christianity twice, and cathedrals, but not the Mother of Parliaments in London.

He disparaged globalism and the “rules-based international order,” though not in nearly as simple-minded a fashion as Pete Hegseth or his subordinates, a dull array of bumpkin Metternichs. The main themes that Rubio hit were the profoundly damaging consequences of unfettered free trade and mass migration. In this, he addressed the justifiable anger that has fueled populism in the United States and abroad, and that even now baffles an uncomprehending wealthier class that does not feel, understand, or even particularly care about what its fellow citizens are experiencing.

Like Vance, Rubio named no foreign adversary—not Russia, China, Iran, or jihadist fanatics. This was partly out of deference to a president who thinks not of enemies but only of potential counterparties to be bargained with, bullied, swindled, or accommodated. And Rubio was evasive when asked about Moscow and Beijing in the brief question-and-answer session. But he also reflected an introversion in the West that can easily go too far.

Rubio's critique of the rules-based international order echoed that of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. Both accept the truth that such rules as have existed have resulted much more from American hard and soft power well exercised than from a Kantian consensus among right-thinking politicians. Far more troubling was Rubio's substitution of the word civilization for values.

Rubio's vaunting of America's roots in Europe may not play well with the descendants of enslaved peoples, Native Americans, and Asian American immigrants. His celebration of Europe's expansion—“its missionaries, its pilgrims, its soldiers, its explorers pouring out from its shores to cross oceans, settle new continents, build vast empires extending out across the globe”—may seem rather one-sided to populations that felt the lash as much as or more than the benefits of colonial rule. And the invocation of Christian civilization leaves at best an uncomfortable marginality for atheists, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Muslims, and Jews.

Abraham Lincoln once said, “I have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence.” There was in Rubio's speech, however, no “decent respect for the opinions of mankind,” no affirmation of innate human equality, no insistence on the fundamental natural rights of the individual, no reverence for God without proclaiming the preeminence of any sect. The Declaration mandates no particular American foreign policy, but the values the document embodies have always informed it, even as American statesmen have struggled to reconcile the country's many mundane interests with the principles that gave it birth.

This was indeed a noteworthy divergence. It may represent Rubio's actual views, or alternatively, his adroit maneuvering within an ideologically constrained political space. The son of Cuban immigrants must have within him something that echoes Lincoln's faith and that of the Founders—at least so one hopes. Whichever it is, his speech outlined a path for American foreign policy that may wander from older verities yet prove far more acceptable to America's allies, and far more constructive, than that of the first year of an administration so shamefully out of the American norm.

This article has been updated to reflect that Marco Rubio's parents were not refugees from Fidel Castro's Cuba, but immigrants from Cuba who first arrived before Castro came to power.

Marco Rubio was more civil than J. D. Vance had been, but the message to longtime allies was the same.

Just like last year, I watched the most important American speech at the Munich Security Conference in the overflow room, sitting on the floor, underneath the speakers. This is the best place both to hear the speech (otherwise the room is too noisy) and to watch the faces of people gathered around the screens. The prime ministers and presidents sit in the main hall, but plenty of other people attend the conference: security analysts, lieutenant colonels, drone engineers, deputy defense ministers, legislators, and hundreds of other people whose professional lives are dedicated to ending the war in Ukraine, bringing peace to Europe, and projecting security in the world.

Just like last year, this group was hoping to hear how the U.S. administration is planning to contribute to these projects. And, just like last year, audience members were disappointed.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Saturday's key speaker, was more civil than Vice President J. D. Vance, who in 2025 attacked and insulted many of the European governments represented in the room. But Rubio's speech had many of the same goals. He did not mention the war, or imply that America would help Europe win it. He did not express the belief that Russia can be defeated. He did not refer to the democratic values and the shared belief in freedom that once motivated the NATO alliance, and that still motivate its European members. Instead, he offered a vision of unity based on a misty idea of inherited “Western civilization”—Dante, Shakespeare, the Sistine Chapel, the Beatles—which would fight against the real enemies: not Russia, not China, but rather migration, the “climate cult,” and other forms of modern degeneracy.

Read: Marco Rubio doesn't get it

The speech worked like a Rorschach test. If you wanted to hear some positive news, you might have been satisfied by the emotive expressions of unity. But one of my German friends clearly heard a “dog whistle” to the German far right. I spoke with a couple of Poles who noticed that the list of great men and great artworks failed to include anyone or anything from their half of the European continent. An Indian colleague was alarmed by the praise for colonialism. In Rubio's repeated references to Christianity, a lot of Americans heard a shout-out to Christian nationalists. And many, many people noticed the oddity of the attack on migration, coming from a son of migrants.

In the hours and days afterward, I did not meet a single person of any nationality who thinks that the American-European relationship is returning to business as usual. Rubio did not say that, and obviously did not want anyone to believe it. Neither did Elbridge Colby, the U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy, who also appeared in Munich. Colby, speaking at a public event, instead promoted the emergence of a “Europeanized NATO” that can defend itself, by itself, with America perhaps offering a theoretical nuclear umbrella. He dismissed the “cloud-castle abstraction of the rules-based international order.” He said that no one should “base alliances on sentiment alone.” This is the message that the Trump administration has been sending all year, and it has not changed.

That message comes with some profound contradictions. Just after Munich, Rubio flew to Bratislava and Budapest, where he heaped praise upon Viktor Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister. President Trump, he told Orbán, is “deeply committed to your success,” a clear reference to upcoming Hungarian elections that Orbán is on course to lose, if the vote is conducted fairly. Many have noted that Orbán has a record of corruption and electoral manipulation, that he puts pressure on judges and independent journalists (hardly any of the latter are left in Hungary), and that Rubio himself signed a letter denouncing the Hungarian prime minister for “democratic erosion” back in 2019.

But in the light of the American message delivered in Munich, the visit was also inconsistent. Orbán, like the far-right leaders in Germany and France who have close ties to Vance and the MAGA establishment, opposes European rearmament. Orbán is not merely seeking to block the emergence of a “Europeanized NATO”; he operates as a de facto spokesperson for Russia inside the European Union.

Robert Kagan: America vs. the world

In practice, Orbán's Hungary creates a major security headache for everybody else. Russians are waging a horrific, damaging, costly war on Ukraine. They have sent drones into Europe, staged regular cyberattacks, and cut undersea cables in the Baltic Sea. Does the United States really want Europe to unite and fight these threats together? If so, why is the Trump administration supporting someone who opposes this project? Europeans can't help but wonder if the American goal is rather to encourage a divided Europe that can't defend itself against anyone.

Plenty of people heard the open messages and the subtle ones, with some unexpected results. Yesterday morning, Politico's Brussels Playbook newsletter reported that finance ministers from six European states were meeting in Brussels to discuss the integration of the continent's financial systems into a capital-markets union. The goal is to jump-start the economy. But as a German friend of mine likes to say, nobody likes capital, nobody likes markets, and nobody likes unions, which is one of the reasons why this long-discussed idea has never created much popular enthusiasm. Some smaller financial institutions might lose out, and they have never been shy about saying so, either.

The Trump administration has changed the nature of this discussion. If Europe is to emancipate itself from the United States, and if Europe is to be prepared to defeat Russia, then European defense and technology companies need to grow much faster and raise much more money than they can right now. Instead of investing in America, Europeans will have to keep more of their money at home. In Munich I heard a lot of determination to pursue this goal. None of that is business as usual either.

Without America to rely on, the EU is gearing up to be a global power in its own right.

The European Union is finally on its way to becoming a power in its own right. That's not because its member countries have suddenly stopped squabbling or its bureaucratic inertia has melted away. It's because the past four years have produced an unremitting state of crisis. Russia's invasion of Ukraine was the beginning. Now the imperative comes from Donald Trump's repositioning of the United States as something close to an antagonist.

Without the guarantee of American cooperation and NATO protection, the EU is newly vulnerable. And in response, in the past year, it has delivered a series of firsts that amount to a quiet revolution in how it exercises power.

In May, the EU decided, for the first time, to help finance defense spending for its 27 member states by taking on EU-wide debt. This move came from the realization that even serious spending hikes in individual countries—European states have doubled their defense outlays since 2015—would vary widely given the economic disparities. Germany, for instance, plans to invest roughly $77 billion over five years, meaning that by 2030, its defense budget could be the world's third largest. But that kind of spending is not possible for countries that already carry more debt, and confronting Russian President Vladimir Putin, potentially without U.S. backing, will require the rearmament of all. To this end, the EU has now established an extraordinary instrument, called Security Action for Europe, or SAFE, that is prepared to fund up to $178 billion in upgrades to the continent's capacity to produce and procure arms.

Shane Harris: Europe is answering Putin's challenge

For the first time, Europe will essentially protect its defense industry. “European preference” was long dismissed as a French fantasy. But that was when buying U.S. weapons was a premium that allies paid for American protection. Now Trump has signaled that the deal is off: He talks with Putin over the heads of the Europeans and has suggested that America's NATO commitments are a fiction. So European states that use SAFE funding will be required to procure more European-made weapons and parts than not. That priority has also been written into Europe's recently agreed-on $107 billion debt-financed Ukraine package, which restricts Kyiv to purchasing European-made arms to the extent possible.

In general, European countries are making a point of reducing their dependence on the United States. Germany currently plans to spend only 8 percent of its rearmament budget on U.S. arms. It is even developing its own satellite-communications network to replace Starlink. Most striking, European capitals for the first time seek to address the core of Europe's dependence: the American nuclear umbrella. Germany and Sweden are in talks with France and the United Kingdom on a potential European nuclear deterrent. Poland and the Netherlands have expressed an interest in joining.

Europe is benefiting economically from all of these changes in defense posture. In equity markets, homegrown defense firms outperformed the top seven U.S. tech stocks last year. And the defense firms are productive: Germany's Rheinmetall will soon be able to produce more artillery shells than the entire U.S. defense industry. And EU leaders are currently considering applying the “buy European” provisions that have helped boost arms manufacturing to other industries, such as digital services and green technologies.

The EU once defined itself as a champion of open markets. Today it's reassessing that commitment in light of its need for self-reliance. Berlin is planning to exclude Chinese suppliers from its 6G network and is testing an open-source alternative to Microsoft. The French government has replaced Zoom with a domestic video-conferencing platform. Together with reducing its dependence on the United States and China, Brussels is cultivating other relationships. In recent weeks it has concluded far-reaching free-trade agreements with members of the Mercosur trade bloc (Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay) and India.

The way that Europe makes decisions is changing to meet the moment, and these changes are perhaps the most crucial of all the “firsts.” In the past, EU members had to unanimously agree before Brussels could adopt policies on matters of particular sensitivity. Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel fiercely defended this rule. But today's leaders have come to accept that abandoning it is the price of geopolitical relevance. In December, the EU invoked an emergency legal provision to bypass the unanimity requirement in order to freeze Russian assets indefinitely. That same month, the EU approved its debt-financed Ukraine package, also without unanimous approval: Hungary, Slovakia, and Czechia were pushed to opt out rather than veto it.

Anne Applebaum: Trump's ‘American dominance' may leave us with nothing

Europe is not yet a fully autonomous power, and it won't become one tomorrow. But thanks to Trump, a transformation is under way. With each new first, others become thinkable. The decisive question is whether Europe can stay this course. A super-election year looms in 2027, when France, Italy, Spain, and Poland will all hold votes. Victories by the far right—especially in France and Poland—could derail the current trajectory.

Or not: EU approval is at 74 percent, a record high. Young far-right politicians may well understand that returning to the nation-state means choosing powerlessness.

This may be the outcome that leaders in Washington, Moscow, and Beijing prefer. But in their effort to fragment Europe into pliable nation-states, they are instead galvanizing its slow-motion march toward self-determination.

The deep roots of mutual aid.

We're making this story accessible to all readers as a public service. Support our journalism by becoming a member today.

We spend a lot of time talking to strangers online these days. But how are our neighbors down the street doing? Is there something they could use a little help with? A way they need to be supported? That's the focus of mutual aid.

This kind of hyper-local assistance covers a wide range of actions: collecting food and funds for those in need, organizing free item exchanges, or walking a child to and from school because of immigration raid fears.

Humans have been helping each other out as long as we've been around. But Fordham University associate professor Tyesha Maddox says we can trace the tradition in the US back to early immigrant communities. She details this history in her book A Home Away from Home: Mutual Aid, Political Activism, and Caribbean American Identity. We look at the history in the latest episode of Explain It to Me, Vox's weekly call-in podcast.

Below is an excerpt of our conversations, edited for length and clarity. You can listen to the full episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you'd like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.

Where did the term “mutual aid” even come from in the first place?

That's kind of controversial only because this idea of mutual aid is one that's not new. Many communities, particularly immigrant communities of color, have always followed mutual aid ideology. In my book, I talk about Caribbean societies following a mutual aid ideology that they inherited from groups in West Africa. However, the terminology for mutual aid comes from the 1800s with Peter Kropotkin, who was an activist and anarchist who coined the term “mutual aid.”

How did Kropotkin define the term? 

He was thinking of mutual aid as an egalitarian, self-directed project. It's a form of political change or participation in which people take responsibility for themselves. This is particularly common when government institutions are not involved in helping out with everyday needs of the people, so the people have to take it upon themselves to take care of their daily needs.

Who were the earliest communities to practice mutual aid in America?

In African-American communities, particularly those in Antebellum society, we have examples of mutual aid. In the north, there were free black societies that participated in mutual aid, particularly around schools for free people or the formerly enslaved. In places like Philadelphia and New York, in the late 19th century, we see immigrant groups such as Chinese and Jewish communities. In all of these groups, we see examples of things like providing insurance for each other, particularly workers' comp, when workers' comp was not a thing. And so if you got sick on the job and you couldn't go to work, they provided a portion of your wages to you.

For many people who come as immigrants, they usually come by themselves. And so mutual aid provided connection for immigrants who are in a new city, in a new country. Another really important function of these mutual aids that we see across many of the groups, particularly in the US, in the Chinese, Caribbean, and Jewish groups, are collective funds which members paid into. In the Caribbean communities, they were called “susu,” and what they were were rotating credit practices. Everyone put in a certain amount of money and then you had a chance to take out that money to use for small loans in order to pay household expenses and mortgages or their rent or just to survive. These associations were really important for financial as well as moral support for immigrant groups.

How do we see mutual aid ebb and flow throughout history?

We see a rise particularly in the period that I study. I follow 1890 to 1940, and we see mutual aid expand exponentially in this period, particularly before World War II. Then we see a weaning-back of mutual aid once we have more government institutions that are being implemented. I think that takes away the need for some of the groups, but not all of them, and so many of them persist. There are Caribbean immigrant mutual aids that I follow that are still in existence today — and have been in existence since the 1920s.

I would say we see the ideology of mutual aid being applied in many of the social movements in the 1950s and the 1960s in particular. I think one of the most popular examples would be that of the Black Panther Party. The Black Panthers were not a mutual aid group, but they definitely practiced many of the ideals of mutual aid. There was a free ambulance program, they had free clothing and shoes. They had legal aid education. They provided a free breakfast program in schools for children in various cities. I think many of the more modern social justice movements have all had an aspect of mutual aid as part of them.

Are there any other differences in the way mutual aid functions now versus the way it's functioned in the past?

I would say the major difference is the way in which the groups are connected. So as opposed to being based on where you're from, the groups that have formed in more recent years tend to be based on current communities or neighborhoods. They don't have as long of a history, but I think the ideals are the same: in looking within the group and helping members out for things that they need in order to keep going.

What do you think draws people to mutual aid in this particular moment that we're in now?

I think there is this sense that no one is going to save us but ourselves, and we have to be responsible for our communities — particularly when we don't see the government stepping in to fill these needs of the group. So for instance, there was a reduction in FEMA assistance, so these impacted communities take it upon themselves to help their neighbors. I think this reliance on ourselves has increased, particularly in 2020 at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic when the government didn't have a plan for people and how we were going to care for each other, but we saw many of our neighbors in need.

If someone wants to start participating in mutual aid, where do they begin? 

I would start with trying to see if there are mutual aid groups that are in your neighborhood or in your community, because in many cases, there actually are. And so you don't have to reinvent the wheel. You look to the older groups who are already there and join those. And if there aren't, then you take it upon yourself to try to start those groups, get together with a few of your neighbors, pool some resources and see what are the needs of your community, and then start by trying to fill those needs in the ways that you can.

Grindr changed gay hookups. Now, ads, bots, AI, and cultural ubiquity have turned it into a ghost town.

What is Grindr supposed to be?

I'm not sure if this existential question is one that keeps anyone up at night, but with the recent announcement that the hookup app is rolling out EDGE, an up-to $500 per month plan powered by “gAI” (pronounced gay-eye) technology, it's an inquiry that came to my mind. I had a few more, too.

Has arranging sex become so complicated that robot assistance is now needed? At up to $500 per month, wouldn't hiring a sex worker be more economical and more climate conscious? Have computer scientists researched what happens when you feed an artificial intelligence a steady stream of horny chats?

Perhaps the most important question: Do the people who run Grindr know what Grindr is?

The introduction of AI feels unnecessarily complicated, throwing more technology and friction onto a platform that's supposed to be direct. According to users I spoke to, it feels like one more thing that the company is working on instead of making the app more user-friendly. For a company that made hooking up so efficient and easy, something about its current form feels exhausting.

The collective dissatisfaction coupled with the rise of newer, more direct hookup apps might be the death knell for Grindr. But there's also something anchoring this fatigue: Beneath the sticker shock and that gay-eye pun is a deeper story of what happens when gay culture becomes comfortably mainstream and what it means to be on Grindr in a world where so many people don't think they need it anymore.

For an app that's supposed to be sexy and fun, a lot of the conversation surrounding Grindr is decidedly not sexy or fun. The way many users talk about it comes from a place of frustration and even embarrassment for using the app at all.

Over the past few years, Grindr users have complained it's become simultaneously more unusable and more expensive. To the people who have used it for nearly a decade, it's a clear example of what's known as “enshittification,” a term coined by Cory Doctorow to describe the phenomenon in which businesses degrade their product to maximize profit. Enshittification is good for business and for executives, but bad for users.

Ryan, a former marketing employee who left in 2023, says the turning point happened in 2022, when Grindr had its IPO. (Ryan asked for anonymity to be able to speak freely about his time at the company. Meanwhile, most of the other men I interviewed for this piece were given pseudonyms to be able to speak frankly about their sex lives.)

After the company went public, Ryan says, the focus shifted from Grindr's users to its investors. New CEO George Arison had a vision for the company that was more aligned with a burgeoning tech company (e.g. an obsession with AI) than it did an irreverent queer startup.

“Grindr really changed the game in a lot of ways; it was a different type of cruising,” Ryan said, explaining the app's subversive roots. “It was, at the time, so cool and inventive, but now, it's taken on a Silicon Valley shape.”

I asked AJ Balance, Grindr's chief product officer, about the criticism that Grindr has strayed from its core mission of making hooking up easier. He said that the hookups are just one segment of the app, and that the company is interested in building other segments. “Some of the principles we have in building our products is giving users choice…and control over what products they want to use,” Balance told Vox. “If users don't want to engage [with these products], they don't have to go there. They can also opt out of these features if they don't want to participate at all.”

To hear Grindr users tell it, the current direction isn't resonating with the people simply using Grindr as god intended: to get laid.

“There's a kind of feedback loop,” Jack, 46, told Vox. “It gets sh*tty. More people leave because it's sh*tty, and they [Grindr] have to make it even sh*ttier for the remaining users in order to mid-max for revenue, not for user experience.”

Jack originally downloaded Grindr back in 2009, when he got his first iPhone and around the same time that he moved to New York City, where he currently lives. That version was free and allowed users to browse 100 profiles. At the time, you could spend $2.99 per month on an ad-free version that doubled the number of accounts you could look at. Jack said his peak usage was from around 2009 to about 2012, and he fully stopped using the app in 2022 — the same year that Ryan, the former employee, also says was the turning point.

According to Jack (as well as other current/former Grindr users I spoke to), the app's sh*ttiness comes in two main forms: ads and bots.

Seemingly, every time you tap within the app — whether you're opening a message, receiving a photo, loading more profiles, etc. — you'll be hit with an ad that interrupts the action. For a service that's supposed to promptly connect excited users to each other, it does its fair share of cockblocking. It's made worse by the content of some of the ads, which can be pretty unhinged. They may involve a game where you save a baby or puppy from lava or ask you to comfort a bald, pregnant woman enduring a miserable life.

Meanwhile, bots are fake profiles that send spam messages to users, often linking to third-party websites or asking for credit card information. Because they're so prevalent, and some are attempting to do legit crimes, Grindr has a “Scam Awareness Guide” instructing users on how not to get phished. While a knowledgeable Grindr user may not ever fall for a bot, these fake profiles still take up space on grids; can count against the total number of profiles you can view; and can inundate your inbox with messages and taps (similar to sending someone an emoji reaction on an Instagram), triggering rounds and rounds of pointless notifications.

According to Balance, the company takes both ads and bots seriously and is looking to “continue to improve the ad experience.” He said that complaints with the ad experience may have to do with Grindr's privacy concerns.

“We actually serve ads with the least possible amount of information to share with advertisers because of that,” Balance said. “And so we don't share personal information beyond IP address and advertiser identifier with user consent. As a result, our ads are less personalized and targeted.”

Want to make these annoyances go away? For now, you'll need to start looking into Grindr's paid model.

That initial $2.99/month price is long gone. Instead, users have the choice between two paid tiers: Xtra and Unlimited. Xtra removes the ads and unlocks the 500 profiles nearest in proximity. Unlimited, the more expensive option, unlocks all the profiles along with additional features, like being able to send photos that disappear after they're opened. The pricing is roughly $15 per week or $150 to $300 per year (there's a slight discount for paying up front, and Grindr offers sporadic sales). According to Balance, there are roughly 15 million active users and 1.2 million users who pay for some kind of premium version of the app.

A core tenet of enshittification is that the user pain points aren't bugs but features. The worse a free experience, the more people will pay to avoid it or to restore it to its original use. In this model, there isn't any incentive to make things better, because that isn't what makes money.

As Grindr's user experience has changed, the culture it helped mainstream changed, too — maybe to the point where Grindr has become obsolete.

Brian Moylan, a culture writer, told Vox that Grindr's trajectory from novelty, to the apex hookup app, to another player in a crowded field isn't that surprising; he's seen it happen before. Prior to Grindr, gay guys were on websites like Manhunt and in Gay.com chatrooms. Grindr disrupted those platforms by offering something location-based and conveniently accessible by smartphone.

Moylan, 47, believes that the Grindr audience seeking out hookups who are annoyed by the app's declining usability have moved to Sniffies, a competitor that launched in 2018 and that puts more direct emphasis on hookups and public sex. Though Sniffies has a paid version ($19.99 per month, with a discount if you pay for three or six months at a time), the basic features are available to users, and the ads in the free version are minimal and easy to click out of.

“People are fed up with the apps in general, not just Grindr, and want more real life experiences,” Moylan said. “That's why you're getting this rise of Sniffies, which is making it more like how cruising used to be. It's also about glory holes, and groups, and anonymity.”

Sniffies's more subversive, sex-forward attitude is also more in line with how gay hookup culture has changed. Moylan says that innovations like PrEP and more general knowledge about safer sex has given queer men more sexual freedom — which includes freedom to explore the kind of kinks and fetishes that Apple's app store restricts but Sniffies caters to. (Sniffies is primarily web-based; the company officially launched an app for iOS in 2025, but it was pulled because of restrictions on adult content.) That newfound freedom coincided with Americans' increasingly open attitudes about being LGBTQ+. (Remember: Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court decision that legalized gay marriage, was still many years away when Grindr launched.)

When Grindr debuted in 2009, it made hooking up with other men extremely easy. All you ostensibly needed were (at least) two men who had the app. But as LGBTQ+ culture, and specifically gay men's hookup culture, becomes more mainstream and socially acceptable, that connection isn't inherent or exclusive to Grindr.

“It's just like when you realize you don't need Grindr to hook up, there's no reason to go back to Grindr,” Phil, a 29-year-old, told me. Phil first used the app when he graduated in college in 2018 but stopped after moving to the South a year later. Now, he and his husband find social media to be more effective and efficient than any gay-specific dating apps. “I don't need to get on Grindr to find somebody that I want to hook up with,” he said. “I already know that because we've been in each other's DMs on Instagram or Twitter.”

“It's so much easier to find a gay guy now,” Moylan said. “Now, you go on a hot guy's Instagram, and there's a rainbow flag in the bio, and like, ‘Oh, okay, I can message you.'”

Perhaps it's a sign of progress that we no longer need a specific gay hookup app to orchestrate a gay hookup.

Meanwhile, Grindr itself has also become mainstream, cementing its place in pop culture. The app has been the subject of late-night sketches. Sabrina Carpenter sampled its distinct notification sounds. It's the punchline in jokes about its own ubiquity. There's also the shopworn trope or gimmick that the people who use Grindr the most are the ones — Republicans, religious figures, etc. — most hostile to gay men.

All of that universality sands away some of its appeal. Shouldn't Grindr, a platform that's about hookups and sex, have some kind of edge to it? Why would gay guys want to be on a site that so many straight people know about?

The men I spoke to for this article did note that, even though they personally have outgrown Grindr, it still serves a purpose: It's likely to be more valuable in small towns, for example, where LGBTQ+ culture might not be as accessible. It also allows younger queer people and men who are in the closet to explore their sexuality. For those users, Grindr is easier to find and more accessible (e.g. on Apple's app store) compared to a site like Sniffies, and it has a bigger user base to connect with.

Grindr's cultural presence as an app that isn't primarily for hookups feels in line with what the company envisions. Balance, the Grindr chief product officer, used the term “gayborhood” multiple times in his conversation with me, explaining that he sees Grindr as more of a community than a hookup space.

“We think the gayborhood concept is a good metaphor for it. Within the neighborhood there are places and spaces for the more hookup or casual encounter-forward aspects of gay life and there are places and spaces for dates and friends and travel,” Balance said, noting that the AI assistant would probably be more inclined for the latter, because it could streamline and organize those recommendations.

In a sense, the community vision might be in line with how Grindr's users now see it. Many of the men I spoke to said Grindr's most useful quality is that it makes traveling easier. In those instances, they don't necessarily use the app for sex, but to connect and ask people for recommendations about which bars to go to, good restaurants to try, and what parties are happening — essentially a social media app.

“I have it because when I go to a new city or I travel or something, it's nice to see who's around. But I wouldn't say that I use it as often,” Ryan, the former Grindr employee, told me. But he said that, while helpful, asking gay guys where to eat and what bars to go to isn't what it was made to do and what it should be.

I ask what it should be.

“Helping gay guys f*ck faster.”

Salesforce cofounder Parker Harris addressed the controversy over CEO Marc Benioff's ICE jokes in an internal meeting, saying he was ""not OK with it,"" Business Insider has learned.

""Marc made a very bad joke,"" Harris, who is the company's chief technical officer, said. ""But that's something that Marc did, and I'm not gonna call him out in public out on the internet.""

A transcript of Harris' remarks at a meeting of the product and tech team last week was posted by an employee to a Slack channel. Business Insider verified that the transcript was accurate.

Salesforce did not respond to a request for comment. Benioff has not spoken about the jokes or the company's reaction to them.

In his meeting, Harris began by addressing a question about why many company leaders had not addressed Benioff's comments at Salesforce's employee-only company kickoff in Las Vegas last Tuesday.

""So I'll start by saying that somebody already has, and it was immediately leaked,"" Harris said, referring to a Business Insider story about another executive who criticized Benioff's jokes.

""Let's talk about it with each other and not out to Business Insider and other places because it doesn't do us any good,"" he said, adding, ""It's a violation of the Code of Conduct, and it's a fireable offense. And if we do catch you, we will fire you.""

At the kickoff, Benioff made ""multiple"" jokes about ICE, including one about agents surveilling Salesforce employee travel, employees told Business Insider at the time.

Workers reacted with anger on Slack, which is owned by Salesforce. Slack General Manager Rob Seaman posted a comment saying he could not ""defend or explain"" his boss' comments.

""They do not align with my personal values and I know this to be the case for many of you as well,"" he wrote.

Craig Broscow, a Salesforce VP, acknowledged the ""deep disappointment"" in his own Slack message after the kickoff remarks.

""It would be a step in the right direction and for Marc to acknowledge as soon as possible — ideally publicly — that his attempted joke was extremely upsetting to large segments of his employee base,"" Broscow said.

Speaking to his team, Harris said Seaman got in hot water for his post.

""I'll tell you personally, and this is what Rob said as well, and I respect Rob for saying that, but he got in big trouble 'cause it went out on the internet,"" Harris said. ""Personally, I'm not OK with that joke.""

Harris went on to say that ""it's hard right now with what is going on [in] the US"" and ""what's going in, like, Minneapolis is not about our software. Our software is not being used there.""

Harris said Salesforce is ""not a political organization"" and encouraged employees to make their views known at the ballot box.

""I'm going to use my democratic right to vote, and that's how I'm gonna take action against some of the things that I'm not okay with,"" he said.

He closed with saying, ""So that's my statement. It may not make you feel better. So I'm sorry if it doesn't make you feel better. I think we should keep talking about it. I'm totally fine talking about it more. Please keep it confidential.""

Big questions are swirling around AI's real impact — and consultants are racing to supply the answers.

Over the past year, consulting firms have begun deploying armies of AI agents as they work to transform their own operations and advise clients to do the same — automating research, building task-specific tools, and building proprietary AI models.

McKinsey & Company CEO Bob Sternfels said last month that his firm has launched tens of thousands of internal AI agents in recent years, and eventually plans to have one for all of the company's 40,000 employees.

Amid the rapid rollout, consultants are now asking themselves a tough question: Is it worth it? They are working to measure if AI is truly improving performance, boosting revenue, and freeing consultants to focus on higher-value work.

""I think we are now in the age of confusion,"" Mina Alaghband, a former McKinsey partner, now the chief customer officer at Writer, a full-stack enterprise AI platform built for agentic AI, told Business Insider.

Alaghband said that a year ago, most companies were focused on adoption, tracking metrics such as how often a tool was used.

Now, she says said the emphasis should be on measuring the value that's created — like the amount of human labor reassigned to higher-value work, or improvements in revenue.

PwC's chief AI officer, Dan Priest, recently told Business Insider that PwC is now less concerned with how many agents it deploys, and more with how many human users each agent has.

Priest said his firm starts by targeting an ""impact zone,"" such as improving the customer experience.

Within these impact zones, the firm looks to deploy ""specialized AI agents"" that have earned that designation because they're good at what they do, Priest said. ""When we deploy agents, we want to see a high rate of human adoption, which means more humans are using them,"" he said.

EY also prioritizes quality over quantity, Steve Newman, EY's global engineering chief, told Business Insider. The firm tracks the value created by its AI agents through key performance indicators for productivity, quality, and cost efficiency on a month-to-month basis.

If the defining promises of the AI boom are speed and efficiency, then the metric that may matter more isn't usage, but time reclaimed.

Boston Consulting Group tracks its agents by that metric — and whether that time is then reinvested in higher-value work, Scott Wilder, a partner and managing director based in Dallas, told Business Insider.

Wilder said humans at the firm now spend about 15% less time on low-value activities, like making slideshows, and that those people are reinvesting about 70% of their saved time into higher-value activities, such as deeper analysis.

Time saved doesn't always mean more work. At BCG, it can mean more free time. Wilder said BCG has found that employees keep about 30% of the time AI saves. ""They get a little more sleep or get to go to a yoga class or whatever someone wants to do,"" he said.

Nearly a century ago, economist John Keynes predicted that as productivity rose, the balance between work and leisure would inevitably change.

""I would predict that the standard of life in progressive countries one hundred years hence will be between four and eight times as high as it is,"" he wrote in his 1930 essay ""Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren.""

It's almost 2030, but in small ways, that vision may already be surfacing.

""It's benefiting them — and this is a tough job, so every hour of free time matters,"" Wilder said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I moved from the US to Brazil after losing my job. Despite the intense culture shock, I couldn't be happier with my decision.","https://www.businessinsider.com/moving-united-states-to-brazil-differences-surprising-things-2026-2","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 12:57:00 GMT","

After an incredible three weeks traveling around Brazil, I was on the first leg of my flight home to Chicago when I received a message from my director at work — a 15-minute ""check-in"" with an HR representative.

Worried I might receive news of a layoff, I frantically deboarded the plane after landing in Rio de Janeiro and joined the call in a quiet corner of the duty-free section of the airport. There, I was informed that my role had been eliminated.

Faced with the reality of returning home to the frigid Chicago temperatures with no job, I quickly changed my connecting flight and decided to hostel-hop around Brazil for another month.

However, even that extra month didn't feel like long enough in the country I'd fallen in love with. Exploring beautiful destinations while practicing a new language every day was incredibly fulfilling for me.

Once I went back to the US, I realized I was looking for ways to push myself out of my comfort zone. I had always wanted to live abroad, and my unemployment seemed like the perfect alignment to make that move to another part of the world.

So, a few months after my original trip, I relocated from Chicago to São Paulo and was greeted by lots of surprises along the way.

Growing up in the Midwest, I've endured my fair share of snowstorms and wind chills so cold that I felt as though my eyelids would freeze together. So, I felt well-equipped for any kind of cold weather Mother Nature could ever throw my way.

Even so, I wasn't prepared for just how chilly Brazil could feel — especially during a springtime cold front while living in an area without access to central heating.

Although Brazil's springtime temperatures (which last from September through November) are similar to what I experienced during the Chicago fall, it was difficult to adjust to the lack of central heating. So, I found myself wearing multiple layers of T-shirts and the only hoodie I brought with me.

Before I moved, I'd only visited Brazil during its smoldering summer months, so I had naively assumed the subtropical temperatures in São Paulo would be pleasant year-round.

Between seeing unrefrigerated milk in grocery stores to trying vegetables I've never heard of, the day-to-day food in Brazil is a lot different than what I was used to in the States.

For example, contrary to the common American adage, breakfast doesn't seem to be the most important meal of the day here; many Brazilians opt for bread or fruit instead of the hefty pancakes or sausage links I was accustomed to.

For lunch and dinner, many locals seem to rely on a tried-and-true formula: arroz (rice), feijão (beans), some meat, and salad.

Classic dishes like stroganoff (a creamy chicken or beef dish topped with crispy shoestring potatoes) or feijoada (pork and black bean stew) may enter the rotation. Still, the aforementioned combo is a popular default dish that I've grown to love.

Although tavern-style Chicago pizza still holds a special place in my heart, my new Brazilian favorites include acarajé (stuffed black-eyed pea fritters fried in dendé oil), acerola (a sweet cherry fruit), and doce de leite (sweet caramelized milk used as a topping or filling).

Plus, there's a pretty great international food scene here, too. While wandering around the city, I've come across a wide range of cuisines, from Lebanese and West African restaurants to Colombian and Venezuelan spots.

One thing I've noticed since my first visit to the country is that Brazilians are very proud to be Brazilian.

From football matches to the celebrations that occur when Brazilian films are nominated for Academy Awards, the people here seem to be the loudest and proudest fans in the room.

Because of this, I was worried I might not feel as welcome as an outsider. Instead, I've found an endearing level of curiosity among many Brazilians I've met, who either want to practice English or ask how I'm enjoying their beloved country.

This openness to connect has softened a lot of the original culture shock during my move. Although very different from my life in Chicago, I'm excited to continue building a life for myself in São Paulo.

It's the end of the world as software companies know it, and this CEO feels fine.

Judging by what some AI experts are saying, and the state of the stock market, you'd think software companies were on their last legs. Basware CEO Jason Kurtz, whose company sells software for financial processes, sees it slightly differently.

""I will tell you there is not a single piece of data that we see that says that,"" said Kurtz.

""I have not had a single customer tell us, 'Oh, we're just going to go figure this out on our own and do AP with OpenAI or whoever.' That's not the way these companies work,"" he added.

Kurtz reached out to me last week after I asked for some reader feedback on the topic. (I genuinely read all your emails. Even the mean ones!)

Basware, which counts Mercedes and Heineken among its roughly 6,500 customers and uses AI within its own products, hasn't felt threatened thus far. Kurtz told me the company saw a 20% year-over-year increase in sales in 2025, primarily driven by a surge in the back-half of the year.

He acknowledged that there had been some customer chatter about experimenting with AI on their own. But more recently, clients just want results.

Kurtz recalled a conversation with the digital transformation officer of a large European company. After spending roughly a million euros on internal AI-related projects in finance over the past year, the executive told Kurtz they ""can't point to a single penny that we have saved, earned, or helped our business in any way.""

""I'm tired of experimenting. I want people who know how to use AI in our processes in our workflows,"" Kurtz said the executive told him.

I asked Kurtz for advice for fellow software companies looking to protect themselves.

Basware primarily works with AWS to help build its AI tools for customers. The company also has an ""AI czar,"" according to Kurtz, to surveil the industry. Figuring out ways to implement AI into your own products that'll drive more value for customers is one way to stay ahead.

There's also strength in numbers. Kurtz said maintaining tight integrations with fellow vendors to become a part of the workflow creates stickiness.

""If we weren't doing that, I'd be even more paranoid,"" Kurtz said.

And then there's the data element. Basware has processed 2.5 billion invoices and 10 trillion euros of spend in the company's 40-year history. Having such a large swath of info can help train models and identify new efficiencies to pitch to customers.

""If you don't have a data strategy around AI and how you're going to use that to differentiate your AI and your capabilities, I think that's going to be a challenge,"" he said.

Larry and David Ellison are getting another shot to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.

The media conglomerate announced Tuesday that it will let the Ellisons make another bid for the company over the next week, with two key stipulations: Their offer has to be more than $31 for each share of WBD, and it will be the last time the Ellisons get to make a formal pitch to the WBD board.

WBD's announcement reopens a deal that was theoretically closed last December, when it agreed to sell most of itself to Netflix in an $83 billion transaction.

Since then, the Ellisons, who bought Paramount last year and want to merge it with WBD, have argued that their offer of $30 per share — for the entire company — was better than Netflix's offer.

They have repeatedly told WBD and its investors that they should get another shot at making their case. Their most recent pitch came a week ago, when they offered to pay billions more in fees — including a $2.8 billion penalty WBD would owe Netflix if it walks away from its existing deal — and dangled the prospect of raising the per-share price they'd pay if the deal didn't close by the end of 2026.

Now, WBD says, they have one more opportunity to bid. WBD says they expect the Ellisons to increase their offer to more than $31 a share. The company is trading around $28 a share, up 170% in the last year.

In a press release, WBD officials say that last week, a ""senior representative"" for Paramount told them that if they had the chance to bid, they would offer $31 per share, but could go above that.

None of this means the existing deal Netflix has with WBD goes away. For starters, WBD continues to formally endorse its Netflix deal. More important: If Paramount does increase its bid, Netflix will have the ability to raise its offer, too.

And no matter what bid WBD eventually agrees to, the deal will still need regulatory approval in the US and overseas. Netflix got a preview of some of the issues regulators might bring up earlier this month during a congressional hearing, when Republicans argued that the company is too woke, and Democrats worried that a combined Netflix/WBD could doom the movie industry.

A Paramount/WBD combination would also get regulatory scrutiny, though the Ellisons are counting on their ties to the Trump White House to give them a leg up.

""We're the same age,"" I told Ernest Ang, a 24-year-old who opened an eatery two years ago with his grandmother's recipes.

And yet, it feels like we live in different worlds.

Every day, he whips up large batches of fried chicken and beef rendang in Singapore's 90-degree tropical heat. On the other side of the island, in the glitzy financial district, I write about the Trump administration and the general chaos of the world.

I started my first job in a newsroom after graduating from college in 2024, diving headfirst into the corporate grind. I sign off at 5:30 p.m. and value the work-life balance my writing job offers.

Last year, I started collecting stories of Singaporean Gen Zers and millennials shunning the comfort and stability of the 9-5 in favor of starting their own food businesses — ventures that come with backbreaking long hours. I was humbled.

Hawker centers, like where Ang set up shop, are the go-to for budget meals in Singapore. They're cheap, hearty, and convenient, and I've eaten from them as long as I can remember.

There are 123 hawker centers in the country, managed by the National Environment Agency. On average, each center has about seven to 10 individual stalls.

Traditionally, they sell dishes like Hainanese chicken rice, bak kut teh, a peppery and flavorful pork soup, or nasi lemak, aromatic rice served with dishes. The stalls are typically run by middle-aged to senior hawkers.

But as younger hawkers join the business, there's been an increase in specialty stalls selling matcha, craft beer, baked goods, and fusion dishes.

Success is an uphill battle, with a massive failure rate due to rising store rents and a frugal consumer base. In 2025, 3,074 food and beverage businesses in Singapore closed their doors, per statistics from the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority of Singapore.

This has not deterred hopeful entrepreneurs — 4,103 new food businesses opened last year.

Most of the young chefs I interviewed work six to seven days a week, getting up well before the sun rises to prep ingredients for the day and retiring late into the night after feeding hungry dinner crowds.

I spoke with eight Gen Z and millennial F&B owners across the country about what makes them tick, what fears give them chills at night, and if they regret choosing a risky career path.

Spoiler: They don't.

Cosmos floated his quadcopter over the ruined warehouse, guiding it through a corner of the roof where shattered metal sheets had collapsed to form a hole.

The drone pilot's unit, the Wild Division, suspected that the building was a logistics hub for Russian soldiers, roughly 15 km, or about 9 miles, from the line of contact in southern Ukraine. These hidden locations often held ordnance or fuel stockpiles, and Cosmos' fiber-optic drone was armed with explosives to destroy them.

Yet inside, the drone rotated its camera to reveal what looked more like a farmer's garage: Four civilian cars, a pair of motorcycles, and two bridled horses.

""We had not expected to see this. It was unusual,"" Cosmos told Business Insider, speaking on condition that he be identified only by his call sign.

""We were expecting to find some armored vehicles,"" he added.

Video of the discovery went viral last week in Ukraine, as the war has increasingly seen Russian soldiers using unconventional transport tools, such as pack animals and bicycles, to conduct assaults or logistics missions. Cosmos said his drone mission was conducted in early February.

The smaller profile of a horse or civilian car might be harder for a drone to spot, though Russia's repeated use of them has also raised questions about the viability of its tactics and whether it's been producing enough military equipment to sustain its invasion.

Cosmos' squad mates and officers at the Wild Division, a first-person-view drone company in the 82nd Air Assault Brigade, had seen clips of Russian soldiers riding on horses to attack Ukrainian positions before.

One famous example they remember was in Zaporizhzhia, when a Ukrainian drone crew attacked Russian infantry crossing the front lines on horseback last month.

Cosmos, who's been piloting drones for a year, said it was the first time he'd personally seen the animals on the front lines.

He flew his explosive-laden drone straight into the back of one of the cars, and said his crew later struck several other vehicles inside. When Russian troops moved their transport assets, the Wild Division found the next warehouse and attacked that one, too, Cosmos said.

""The enemy usually lives in hiding close to these places,"" Cosmos said of the warehouse. ""It's common for us to check all targets. Sometimes we can see the enemy infantry, or you can see their vehicles.""

The Wild Division declined to say where exactly the warehouse was located, but its brigade is generally deployed in the Donbas.

The commander of Cosmos' battalion told Business Insider that the discovery of the horses surprised him, too.

""I thought it had been a location for transport vehicles, sort of a transfer hub,"" said the major, whose call sign is Fizruk.

Fizruk said the appearance of horses and cars in his area of the front line could be a sign that Russian forces are running low on standard resources, but also reflects Moscow's attritional nature of fighting.

The cars discovered by Cosmos appear to be Nivas, inexpensive civilian off-road vehicles from the Russian Lada car brand.

""They treat these like they will be losses anyway, that they will be destroyed anyway,"" he said. ""Look, a Niva costs, let's say, $2,000. A Hummer, which the Armed Forces of Ukraine uses in many places, costs $20,000, maybe more.""

""Since they lose their equipment in assaults, from that point of view, why pay $20,000 for one vehicle if you can buy 10 Nivas for $20,000?"" Fizruk added.

The Kremlin is known to pressure the front line with repeated ground assaults, sending small groups of infantry to approach Ukrainian positions on foot or in cheap vehicles. The strategy has been costly, with NATO now saying that up to 25,000 Russian troops are dying each month.

Sustaining that style of war has pushed Moscow to informal means of recruitment and weapons procurement, including hiring troops from overseas and receiving ammunition from North Korea.

At Meta's Manhattan office, employees line up for Mediterranean lamb loaded with mint and pomegranate molasses and dessert options like cassis and pear mousse. At KKR's headquarters nearby, staff at the private equity firm order from a rotating lunch menu and have access to a full-service barista counter and a smoothie and juice bar.

The competition over who does lunch best isn't confined to the office. A recent debate on X pitted Anthropic's pre-plated meals against OpenAI's self-serve setup.

Against a backdrop of widespread corporate austerity, at Big Tech, hedge funds, and A-list companies, the office cafeteria is the last great workplace indulgence. The ""hardcore era"" of layoffs, tightened performance standards, and demands for more productivity from leaner teams has continued into 2026. Many companies are cutting back on wellness perks like gym memberships, stipends for work travel, and meals consumed on a worker's own time. Free lunch is one of the few perks that's not only surviving, but growing.

Nearly half of caterers identified corporate catering as their primary source of revenue, according to a 2023 industry survey by the International Caterers Association, while the leading companies say the demand in recent years has shifted from occasional treats for employees to regular meals.

The employer-provided upscale lunch, after all, offers a remarkably good return on investment for companies: it delivers an instant morale boost, and encourages workers to show up in person, stay longer, and interact more across teams.

""The glib answer is, it's still cheaper than giving bonuses, stock options, and ownership,"" says Scott Steinberg, CEO of the consulting firm FutureProof Strategies. ""They're recurring benefits. They're visible.""

As companies compete for top talent, food has become a strategic calling card. Tech firms, hedge funds, and other corporations prominently feature culinary benefits in their recruiting materials. And at a time when LinkedIn feeds are clogged with layoff announcements and bleak predictions about the future of work, photos of enticing plates of food offer companies a welcome dose of good publicity — and maybe even a leg up in the talent wars.

Google famously set the standard years ago with free, high-quality meals at the office. The company trimmed its dining budget in 2023, scaling back the hours of cafés and consolidating its microkitchens, but the offerings are still impressive. ""You'll end up having food from almost every cuisine over the span of a month,"" says one Google employee in Seattle. Recent standouts have included jerk chicken, butter paneer, and artisanal pizza.

The trend expanded to more workplaces. In the 2000s, Michael Bloomberg's terminal and media company stirred up envy among its competitors with its wide variety of free snacks, which also kept workers from wasting precious time grabbing coffee or a late-afternoon pick-me-up.

There are outliers, of course. At Microsoft, most locations don't offer free food, with the Bay Area being an exception. Apple offers food at subsidized prices. Amazon also doesn't offer complimentary meals, though it does give out free bananas. When Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022, he eliminated the company's free lunch program.

Corporate catering companies are benefiting from the trend.

A 2024 report from Dinova and Technomic found that corporate catering orders surpassed weddings in revenue in 2023, and are expected to be the main driver behind the catering services market exceeding $103 billion by 2027.

Aramark's Business & Industry division, which serves food, beverage, and hospitality programs to a range of workplaces, has reported consistent growth in the post-pandemic years as more companies have leaped onto the catered lunch trend.

Diane Pancoski, a vice president of marketing strategy and innovation at Aramark's workplace experience group, says that workplaces are focused on fostering collaboration and boosting employee well-being.

""Growth in corporate dining is being fueled by the way organizations increasingly view food and hospitality as a strategic component of the workplace experience,"" she says. In particular, she's seen increased demand for high-end catering offerings from corporate clients.

Doubling down on lunch also reflects a broader reality of the AI era: Nearly everyone is competing with tech companies for top talent, and that means creating an office environment that more closely resembles Google's.

""In order to attract and retain top talent, especially top technical talent, these organizations have to make in-office perks enticing,"" says Candice Pokk, a senior consultant in organizational effectiveness at HR and benefits consultancy Segal. Companies are doing more in-person events and investing in fancier options, Pokk says.

And who doesn't love free food? A University of South Florida study published last September found that employees prefer food perks and social programming over health benefits and gym memberships. Programs that fostered interactions among colleagues led workers to feel more valued, boosting their sense of company loyalty, it said.

Even as companies lean into the free-lunch trend, experts note that companies are cutting back on other food-related perks. A recent SAP Concur survey found that 42% of travel managers reported plans to cut travel costs.

For companies, the real value of in-office lunch lies in culture. Shared meals create what Steinberg calls ""serendipitous collisions"" — moments when colleagues bump into one another, sparking conversations that lead to collaboration.

Free food, on its own, doesn't necessarily lead to colleagues engaging more with one another. Pokk says the ideal scenario is when companies create an experience around the food that is integrated into an engagement strategy. When a company offers an exciting perk like a Michelin-starred chef, employees talk about it with others and take pride in the organization they work for.

""It doesn't do anybody good if you just grab your food and leave,"" says Pokk.

When KKR opened an additional full-service café this past fall to support its expanding workforce, its goal was to facilitate teamwork, says Grace Koo, the firm's global head of human capital. ""The firm's café is intentionally designed as a central hub for collaboration, encouraging employees to step away from their desks and connect with colleagues over meals,"" Koo says.

Enticing food options can also encourage longer hours and better compliance with return-to-office mandates.

Goldman Sachs just increased its nightly dinner allowance from $30 to $35 for employees working in the office past 8 p.m.

Gap's corporate headquarters in San Francisco began requiring corporate employees to work from the office five days a week in September, and says roughly 70% of that workforce gets lunch on campus every day.

The high engagement rate underscores how central food is to the company's approach to experience and culture, a Gap spokesperson said. The company has an elaborate campus culinary program, though it doesn't come free.

At the Gapeteria, with its communal wooden tables and sweeping views of the Golden Gate Bridge and downtown San Francisco, menu options include hangar steak with sweet potato fries and a grilled burrata sandwich with pine nut salsa macha.

The addition of smoothie stands, espresso bars, and in-office events with impressive catering is also in response to the tastes of younger employees, who place a premium on over-the-top benefits. These employees are more likely to respond to a barista who brews lattes with the company logo than to a traditional, self-service coffee set-up.

""You have a whole new generation of workers who have different demands and expectations for their work experience,"" says Pokk. ""Many of these younger employees want elevated experiences.""

That demand has helped fuel a boom in the catering industry, with stricter return-to-office mandates and increased corporate demand driving that growth.

When celebrity chef Daniel Boulud launched Cuisine Boulud, his bespoke catering company, at One Madison Avenue in New York, part of its model was to provide catering to companies based in the building. Employees at Fox are among the first to enjoy the perk, a spokesperson said. Employees can also enjoy the convenience of a variety of other Boulud culinary offerings located in the high-rise, including Le Jardin Sur Madison, a gourmet French restaurant on the roof.

""The venture was launched to meet the robust demand for larger-scale social and corporate events, daily office catering, and is also the exclusive caterer for venues Le Jardin Sur Madison,"" says a spokesperson for the project, which is a joint venture with Aramark and the Dinex Group.

Among the workers Business Insider interviewed for this story, most say they appreciated the free meals, but that the perk isn't a priority when they're evaluating job offers.

One outlier, an employee for Microsoft in the Bay Area, says the promise of a high-quality, company-provided lunch would be a ""very important"" factor.

At Microsoft, he gets multiple free meals daily, snacks, and access to a juice bar, and he eats lunch with his team nearly every day — which he believes makes them more productive and more connected to one another. For him, the perk says a lot about company culture, including that it wants to recruit the best people and treat them well.

""That's a genuine factor in which company to join, because it's like a litmus test for how they treat their employees,"" he says.

""If somebody paid me $10,000 more and said you wouldn't have food, I would not take that job.""

Business Insider Edition 

Somalia has officially joined the East African Community (EAC) passport system, becoming the bloc's sixth member to issue the regional travel document. The move is expected to ease cross-border movement, boost trade, and strengthen regional integration.


        The approval was handed over on Tuesday in Dar es Salaam during a ceremony attended by Somalia's ambassador to Tanzania and the EAC, Ilyas Ali Hassan, Internal Security Minister Abdullahi Sheikh Ismail, and Immigration Director General Mustafa Dhuhulow.
    


        The ambassador formally handed over the authorisation document, giving Somalia the green light to produce a passport recognised across all EAC member states.



        Issuance of the East African e-Passport began in 2017 as member states moved to modernise regional travel documents. Kenya led the rollout on September 1, 2017, followed by Tanzania (January 31, 2018), Burundi (May 31, 2018), Uganda (December 18, 2018) and Rwanda (July 1, 2019).
    


        South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are still implementing the system.
    


        “This is a key moment for Somalia and its engagement with regional institutions,” Ilyas said. “The handover reflects ongoing efforts to align Somalia's travel systems with EAC standards. This marks another milestone in facilitating the movement of EAC citizens.”
    


        With the green light, Somalia can now begin technical and administrative preparations for producing the passport. This includes aligning its immigration systems with regional standards, establishing printing processes, and coordinating recognition procedures with partner states once issuance begins.
    


        The development comes a day after Somalia and Tanzania signed a memorandum of understanding on immigration cooperation, introducing visa-on-arrival for holders of diplomatic and service passports and simplifying entry for ordinary travellers under agreed conditions.
    


        Officials said the framework will reduce administrative barriers while promoting trade, education, and professional exchanges.
    


        The MoU also establishes coordination channels between immigration authorities, including information-sharing, implementation reviews, and mechanisms to resolve operational challenges, ensuring smoother cross-border mobility.

Business Insider Edition 

Italian energy giant Eni has announced a major natural gas and condensate discovery offshore Côte d'Ivoire, marking the second-largest hydrocarbon find in the country's history.


        The discovery, named Calao South, was made after drilling the Murene South‑1X exploration well in Block CI‑501, where Eni holds a 90% stake in partnership with state-owned Petroci Holding.
    


        The company estimates the field contains up to three trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 100 million barrels of condensate, roughly equivalent to 1.4 billion barrels of oil. The find follows Eni's earlier Baleine field development, which remains the country's largest offshore resource.
    


        The well was drilled by the Saipem Santorini drillship to a depth of over 5,000 metres in water around 2,200 metres deep. High-quality reservoir sands were encountered, and Eni plans further testing to determine production potential and timelines for commercial development.
    


        The Calao South find strengthens Ivory Coast's energy base, supporting potential domestic power generation, industrial growth, and regional exports.
    


        “This discovery confirms the significant resource potential offshore Ivory Coast and reinforces the region's appeal to global energy investors,” said an Eni spokesperson.
    


Reuters reports that output from Baleine, Ivory Coast's largest hydrocarbon development, is expected to rise to 150,000 barrels of oil and 200 million cubic feet of gas per day with the launch of Phase 3, noting this would make the field a key asset for the country's domestic energy needs.



        With rising demand for energy across West Africa, this discovery could also help Ivory Coast meet domestic consumption while exporting to neighboring markets.
    


        For Eni, the find reinforces its strategic presence in West Africa, complementing other deepwater projects in Angola, Ghana, and Nigeria.
    


        Italian energy giant Eni has in recent years deepened its oil production collaboration across Africa.
    


        In a previous report, Business Insider Africa noted that Eni, alongside the United Kingdom's BP, confirmed a fresh 500 million-barrel oil discovery offshore Angola, reinforcing the Southern African nation's efforts to bolster crude production amid sustained output pressures and shifting global energy flows.
    


        The Calao South discovery highlights the continuing potential of West Africa's offshore hydrocarbon basins, attracting multinational energy companies eager to tap new gas and condensate reserves to meet both regional and global demand.

Business Insider Edition 

#Featuredpost


        In a country where millions search daily for how to sell bitcoin in Nigeria or check the bitcoin to naira rate today, speed and trust have become the real currency. Monica Cash has now surpassed ₦500 billion in total transactions, marking three years of sustained growth and reinforcing its position as the best crypto app in Nigeria for users who demand instant conversions, secure payments, and complete financial control within one seamless platform.
    


        Over the past three years, Monica Cash has evolved from a focused crypto conversion tool into a comprehensive everyday finance application serving more than 500,000 registered users nationwide. What began primarily as a fast and reliable way to convert bitcoin to naira has matured into a platform intentionally built to solve real, daily financial needs beyond trading activity.
    


        This growth has been powered by consistency rather than hype. Many Nigerians first downloaded the app to sell bitcoin in Nigeria or complete USDT to naira transactions quickly during urgent market movements. What sustained user retention, however, was dependable payout speed, transparent exchange rates, and a clean interface that removed unnecessary complexity from crypto transactions. As users repeatedly experienced reliable settlements, word-of-mouth referrals accelerated. That organic trust became one of the strongest forces behind Monica Cash's steady expansion.
    


        According to the Founder, the long-term ambition extended beyond simple crypto conversion. “We understood that Nigerians needed more than just a place to convert bitcoin to naira. They needed a dependable financial platform they could use every day. Becoming the best crypto app in Nigeria means delivering speed, transparency, and security consistently, not only during market highs but during everyday transactions.”
    


        Today, Monica Cash operates as more than a crypto gateway. Users can top up airtime, purchase data, pay electricity and cable bills, access digital gift cards, and transfer funds instantly to over 30 Nigerian banks. This strategic diversification strengthens its identity as an integrated financial ecosystem rather than just a trading utility.
    


        For users who closely monitor the bitcoin to naira rate today or require immediate USDT to naira settlements, execution speed remains decisive. In volatile markets, even short delays can translate into missed value. Monica Cash processes withdrawals rapidly, often within minutes, reducing uncertainty and reinforcing confidence. With over $350 million processed
    


        in crypto conversions alone, the platform demonstrates both operational depth and strong liquidity management.
    


        Beyond speed and scale, compliance discipline has quietly shaped Monica Cash's internal structure. In an environment where informal operators sometimes weaken public trust, structured transaction monitoring, transparent rate calculations, and consistent reporting standards provide measurable reassurance. This operational maturity strengthens confidence for anyone looking to sell bitcoin in Nigeria or convert bitcoin to naira within a regulated and secure framework.
    


        Security architecture remains central to the platform's long-term credibility. Biometric login functionality, encrypted transaction processing, and high system uptime directly address one of the most important concerns Nigerians face when choosing the best crypto app in Nigeria. In a competitive digital finance market filled with short-term entrants, sustained performance and reliability continue to differentiate Monica Cash as a stable financial partner.
    


        Importantly, the ₦500 billion milestone signals more than transaction volume. It reflects behavioral trust at scale. When over half a million Nigerians repeatedly choose the same platform to sell bitcoin in Nigeria, complete USDT to naira transactions, and check the bitcoin to naira rate today, it suggests confidence built through repeated positive experience. That kind of cumulative validation cannot be manufactured through marketing alone; it is earned through operational consistency.
    


        Crossing ₦500 billion represents three years of disciplined execution, technological refinement, and user-centered design. For individuals looking to convert bitcoin to naira instantly, complete seamless USDT to naira transactions, or operate within a secure ecosystem that simplifies everyday payments, Monica Cash continues to raise the benchmark. Download Monica Cash today and discover why more users consistently choose it as the best crypto app in Nigeria for crypto conversion and everyday financial management in one trusted platform.

Palantir is embracing a sunshine state of mind.

The company said on Tuesday that it had moved its headquarters to Miami.

We have moved our headquarters to Miami, Florida.

In 2020, Palantir moved its HQ from Palo Alto, California, to Denver. CEO Alex Karp owns property in Colorado.

A Palantir spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on what the HQ move means for its Colorado employees and whether Karp plans on spending more time in Miami.

Like Austin, Miami emerged as a buzzy location for startups and investors during the pandemic, with some big names in venture capital moving to the city and predicting huge growth.

The White House's AI czar, investor and ""All-In"" podcast host David Sacks, recently predicted that Miami would one day overtake New York City as the finance capital of the world. (The data shows that NYC clearly holds the finance crown.)

While some of those names have since returned to California amid the AI boom, Miami continues to attract wealthy business leaders — including some who recently bought homes or opened offices in the city amid worries about a proposed California wealth tax.

Thiel Capital, created by billionaire Palantir cofounder Peter Thiel, opened a Miami office in December.

And in one of the most high-profile Miami moves, Citadel in 2022 announced that it was relocating its global headquarters there, saying the city ""is on a path to becoming a destination of choice for the global financial industry."" (Business Insider previously interviewed Citadel employees on what their work life was like in the city, which you can read here.)

Palantir stock was trading up .8% following the announcement. The stock has been struggling in recent months, down more than 35% from an all-time high in early November. But shares are still up over the longer term, having risen 75% since the start of 2025.

In this article

Figma is partnering with Anthropic and launching a feature called ""Code to Canvas"" that converts code generated in artificial intelligence tools like Claude Code into fully editable designs inside Figma.

The feature, announced Tuesday, creates a bridge between AI coding tools and Figma's process, allowing users who have built working interfaces by prompting an AI agent to bring it directly into Figma's canvas.

There, teams can refine it, compare options side by side and align on design decisions.

The move reflects a broader bet that agentic coding tools like Claude Code haven't eliminated the need for design, and made it more essential. But the risk is that Figma is building a better on-ramp to a highway it no longer controls. 

Watch our exclusive conversation with Figma CEO Dylan Field at 9:30 a.m. PT/12 p.m. ET at this link.

If AI tools keep improving, teams may eventually skip the design refinement step altogether.

Anthropic's products have been at the center of a massive sell-off in software as a service stocks that traders on Wall Street have dubbed the ""SaaSpocalypse.""

The iShares software ETF has fallen into bear market territory. Names like Salesforce, ServiceNo, and Intuit have taken double-digit hits.

Figma has been caught in the downdraft.

The stock has fallen dramatically since its IPO last summer, swept up in the same indiscriminate selling that has punished anything with a SaaS business model. The company reports earnings on Wednesday after the market close.

Figma stock is down about 85% from the 52-week high of $142.92 that it reached in August.

Iran partially closed the strategically vital Strait of Hormuz on Tuesday, state media reported, citing ""security precautions"" as Tehran's Revolutionary Guard conducts military drills in the waterway.

It comes as the U.S. and Iran hold talks in the Swiss city of Geneva, seeking to resolve an ongoing dispute over Tehran's nuclear program.

It marks the first time Iran has shut parts of the Strait of Hormuz, a major international waterway that links crude producers in the Middle East with key markets across the globe, since U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Tehran with military action in January.

Located in the gulf between Oman and Iran, the strait is recognized as one of the world's most important oil choke points.

About 13 million barrels per day of crude oil transited the Strait of Hormuz in 2025, accounting for roughly 31% of global seaborne crude flows, data provided by market intelligence firm Kpler showed.

Tuesday's temporary closure of the waterway was aimed at ensuring shipping safety as part of the Revolutionary Guard's ""Smart Control of the Strait of Hormuz"" drill. The exercise is designed to improve Iran's operational readiness and bolster its deterrence, among other objectives.

Iran and the U.S. reached an understanding of the ""guiding principles"" during the talks, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told reporters after they concluded, Reuters reported. 

The progress does not mean an agreement will be reached soon and more work still needs to be done, he added.

Energy market participants had been closely watching the outcome of the U.S.-Iran talks, particularly as both sides have increased their military presence in the region.

Oil prices were last seen trading lower, erasing earlier gains. International benchmark Brent crude futures with April delivery fell 1.8% to $67.48 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures with March delivery stood 0.4% lower at $62.65 

Jakob Larsen, chief safety and security officer at Bimco, which represents global shipowners, said the temporary closure of the Strait of Hormuz was likely to cause ""minor nuisance and delays"" to inbound shipping headed for the Persian Gulf — but no major disruptions.

""The exercise establishes a live firing exercise area overlapping the inbound part of Strait of Hormuz's Traffic Separation Scheme, and requests that shipping keeps clear of the area for the duration of a few hours,"" Larsen said.

""Given the level of tension in the area, it is expected that commercial shipping will comply with the Iranian request to keep clear of the exercise area,"" he added.

The restaurant investors behind the success of Dave's Hot Chicken are making a new nationwide bet on the next-hottest restaurant trend: birria.

Mike's Red Tacos, a San Diego-based birria chain with just two locations, plans to announce on Tuesday a new franchising initiative that will build hundreds of restaurants across the U.S., with support from early-stage backers Bill Phelps and Andrew Feghali, CNBC can report. 

Financial terms of their investment, which took place in early 2025, were not disclosed.

""We just saw that this was a brand and a concept that really had legs to it,"" Phelps told CNBC. ""And then the critical thing is, we brought down prospective franchisees. ... Everyone gave it the thumbs up.""

Phelps said he had never heard of birria before Feghali introduced him to Mike's.

Traditional birria is a beef or goat stew, slow cooked with spices and chiles to give the meat lots of flavor. Birria tacos, like those sold at Mike's, use the slow-cooked meat as a filling and usually include a consomme on the side as a dip for the taco. 

Once known as a regional Mexican food, birria now appears on 3.7% of U.S. menus, according to Datassential. That's more than quadruple its menu penetration four years ago, based on the firm's data, but there's still a long runway before it reaches ubiquity.

Mexican-inspired fast-food brands such as Qdoba, El Pollo Loco, Del Taco and even Taco Bell have released their own versions of birria. And there's at least 478 restaurant operators running birria-focused restaurants, according to Datassential.

Mike's menu also includes burritos, loaded nachos and fries, and birria ramen.

""It appeals to a very broad range of guests — it's not just your millennials and Gen Zs,"" Phelps said, speaking about the customers in Mike's Red Tacos restaurants. ""There's older people in the restaurant, there's little kids, so it's got a very, very broad appeal.""

Phelps co-founded Wetzel's Pretzels in 1994 and became a founding investor in Blaze Pizza, the fast-casual pizza chain founded by Elise and Rick Wetzel. In 2019, Phelps joined Dave's Hot Chicken as an investor and CEO, using franchising to expand the chain quickly to hundreds of restaurants worldwide. Last year, private equity firm Roark Capital bought a majority stake in Dave's Hot Chicken in deal worth roughly $1 billion.

Feghali was one of the first franchisees of Dave's Hot Chicken. He is also one of the nation's largest Little Caesars operators. 

Together, Feghali and Phelps founded Four Wall Partners, a restaurant franchising investment firm. In addition to being early-stage investors in Mike's, they will act as advisors and members of the chain's board. 

Vincent Montanelli, who most recently served as chief executive of Wetzel's, has joined Mike's to serve as president.

Founded originally as a food truck five years ago, Mike's Red Tacos opened its first brick-and-mortar location in 2022. Founder Mike Touma plans to open his third location in March; he'll stay on with the company as a board member and franchisee of the chain's San Diego locations.

""We put together a deal where [Touma is] going to keep the rights to his stores and future stores in San Diego, and then we're going to franchise it across the rest of the U.S. and internationally,"" Phelps said.

The new team plans to follow the established playbook used by Wetzel's and Dave's to grow Mike's Red Tacos quickly.

""We're going to be very aggressive where we grow with this, because we've seen that we can do that,"" Phelps said.

The taco chain has already secured franchising development deals with multi-unit operators for more than 200 locations nationwide, from California to Texas to New England. Some of those franchised restaurants could open as soon as the end of the year.

Phelps anticipates stiff competition from national chains and local taco restaurants alike. However, he said he thinks that the chain's simple menu, delicious food and an aggressive marketing strategy can help Mike's overtake rivals. 

""We think this can be a winner,"" Phelps said.

In this article

Silver and gold fell Tuesday as investors awaited delayed economic data, with little geopolitical news during the holiday-shortened week.

Spot silver was last seen down 4.6% to trade at around $73.07 per ounce, while silver futures fell 6% to trade at $73.05 per ounce. 

Hecla Mining, which owns one of the biggest silver mines in the world, Green Creek Mine in Alaska, was down 5.8%.  First Majestic Silver was down 6%, Coeur Mining lost 3.8%, Teck Resources and Silvercorp Metals were lower by 2.5% and 5.6%, respectively, and Wheaton Precious Metals was down 3.4%. 

Despite geopolitical tensions resurfacing in the Middle East, Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note published Tuesday that silver was ""trading $7 below its real adjusted price in 1790,"" after prices fell in the morning.

Meanwhile, spot gold was down over 2% to $4,865.41 per ounce, and gold futures lost 3% to trade at $4,889.30 per ounce. 

Silver ETFs, including ProShares Ultra Silver was down 10.8%, while iShares Silver Trust fell just over 5%

Gold and silver prices tumbled in late January as investors reacted to news that President Donald Trump had nominated Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve, leading to a stronger U.S. dollar. Silver futures plunged 30% at the time, marking their worst day since March 1980. 

However, the sell-off in precious metals was short-lived, with gold and silver rebounding in early February. 

Elsewhere, Australian global mining company BHP sealed a silver deal with Wheaton Precious Metals. The mining giant said the long-term silver streaming agreement would see BHP receive an upfront payment of $4.3 billion in exchange for delivering silver produced at its Antemina mine.

In this article

Snap is introducing a subscription feature that will allow creators to earn recurring income directly from their most engaged fans, as the social media company works to diversify beyond advertising.

The Los Angeles company will begin testing ""Creator Subscriptions,"" as the feature is called, on Monday, starting with a small cohort of Snapchat creators, the company told CNBC exclusively. With user growth moderating, Snap's expansion into paid creator subscriptions emphasizes the company's initiative to grow income beyond advertising and build more predictable revenue streams. 

""In the year ahead, growth in subscribers will be a critical input metric to track our progress,"" Snap CEO Evan Spiegel wrote earlier this month as part of the company's fourth-quarter results. 

Snap's existing subscription offerings, Snapchat+ and Memories Storage Plans, grew 71% year over year to reach 24 million users in the period. However, the company reported 474 million daily active users, down 3 million from the previous quarter. 

With the upcoming feature, Snapchat users will be able to pay to subscribe to their favorite creators and receive exclusive content, including direct photos or videos, as well as access a subscriber-only Story and send text-based replies that can be featured at the top of a creator's public Story.

""We want the next step in our long-term creator monetization journey to be one that's really rooted in real relationships,"" said Jim Shepherd, Snap's head of content partnerships, in an interview with CNBC. ""And help creators expand the ways that they make money in a way that's predictable and they can make money from their most engaged fans.""

Snap is entering an increasingly crowded market for direct-to-fan subscriptions. 

Platforms like Patreon, Substack and OnlyFans are built around paid memberships, while major social media companies have introduced their own in-app subscription tools. In 2018, Google's YouTube started offering Channel Memberships, where creators receive 70% of membership revenue after taxes and fees are deducted, with transaction costs covered by the company. In 2020 and 2022, respectively, Meta's Facebook and Instagram began allowing creators to offer subscriptions, and Meta currently lets them keep 100% of subscription revenue after fees, according to company's website.

On Snapchat, creators will be able to set their own subscription price within a range of $4.99 to $19.99 per month. After platform fees, creators will receive approximately 60% of subscription revenue. Snap said it will provide creators with performance data to help guide pricing decisions as the product evolves beyond its initial test phase.

Snap's initial group includes 15 creators to start, with roughly 10 more expected in the U.S. during the early test phase. The company said outreach is also underway in Canada, the U.K. and France. Participants include popular creators like David Dobrik, Catherine Paiz, Harry Jowsey, Jeremiah Brown and Skai Jackson.

""We've built a place where their income feels really rewarding, consistent, sustainable,"" Shepherd said. Creators ""consistently say that it's a great place where they can make a living by being themselves.""

Creators on Snapchat currently earn revenue through ads in Stories and Spotlight under the company's Unified Monetization Program as well as through brand partnerships.

Shepherd said that Snap's advantage lies in distribution and discovery through the company's Spotlight feature, which shows users short-form videos from other users on the app.

""We have a built-in distribution engine where so many creators are building fandoms,"" Shepherd said. 

Over the coming weeks, the feature will be available for users in eligible countries using Apple iOS devices. Creators Subscriptions will not be available for Android users initially, and the company did not say when that will change.

Six-time NBA Champion Los Angeles Lakers owner Jeanie Buss said new majority owner Mark Walter's access to capital will help the team best compete with the NBA's top franchises — and that her late father, Jerry Buss, would have supported the sale. 

""What was important to him was that the Lakers stay at the top of the NBA, and to stay at the top of the NBA, you need to have the resources,"" Buss said. ""You need to have everybody pulling together. And he would want [that for] the Lakers, because the Lakers are his legacy.""

While the NBA has a salary cap that can limit team spend, franchises do have some flexibility if owners are willing to pay a luxury tax. Team spend per season currently ranges from about $154 million to $220 million, with the Lakers seventh overall at $197 million, according to Basketball Reference. Walter has consistently been one of the top spending owners in Major League Baseball since acquiring the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2012. 

Buss and her family agreed to sell their majority stake in the team to Walter last year at a $10 billion valuation. ESPN recently documented significant conflict between the Buss siblings that led to the sale, which Buss called ""bittersweet."" 

Jerry Buss willed ownership of the team to his six children in a trust when he died in 2013.

""My siblings were involved in the decision that was made,"" Jeanie Buss said. ""It's about the Lakers and the greatness and what the fans expect, and you need resources and you need a direction. I think it's fair to say that my family — we all have our different opinions and [are] living our lives, choosing what we want to do with our time, and this was the best decision for all six of us.""

The Buss family kept about 15% of the team, and Jeanie Buss agreed to stay on as governor for at least five years. Still, when asked if she plans to stay for the full term, Buss seemingly hedged her answer. 

""That's what I agreed to,"" Buss said. ""Mark Walter and I are very comfortable with the way things are set up. And I expect things to go on and be successful. And you know, I'm not going anywhere.""

Buss acknowledged the past 12 months have been one of transition for the team, given both the sale and the team's decision to trade star forward Anthony Davis for Luka Dončić about a year ago. Buss said the team's focus is now on building around Dončić, rather than 41-year-old LeBron James, who has been the face of the team since he joined in 2018.

""The partnership will give us the stability to continue to move forward as we build towards a team around Dončić,"" Buss said. ""We couldn't be more proud that he is a Laker. He is a young all-star that the fans love to see.""

James said Sunday he's still unsure whether he'll play beyond this season. Buss said she'd leave James' future with the Lakers to James. Still, she sounded doubtful that he would return to the team next season, either because he would retire or because he would choose to play elsewhere.

""Never say never, but you know, he certainly hasn't given an indication,"" said Buss. ""He's earned the right to decide how his career will go, and you know, he continues to impress.""

Buss also discussed her tequila brand, Cincoro, created in 2016 when five friendly competitors met for dinner around an NBA board of governors meetings, bonding over their shared passion for tequila. That group included Buss; then-Charlotte Hornets owner Michael Jordan; Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Wes Edens; and former Boston Celtics co-owner Wyc Grousbeck and his wife, Emilia Fazzalari.

""We all had a mutual appreciation for tequila,"" Buss said. ""And us being a very competitive group, we thought, 'You know what? We could probably make one better.' And so, that night, Cincoro was born.""

Jordan, known for being a fierce competitor on the court, isn't any different behind the scenes and is deeply involved in the business, Buss said. 

""I knew he was a tough competitor because his first championship, he beat the Los Angeles Lakers,"" she said. ""He's just like that in the boardroom. It's, 'Who are we up against? Let's be better than that. Let's work harder. Let's be more creative.'""

Jordan brought in his design team, resulting in a distinctive bottle that Buss called ""a work of art.""

""When you work with Michael Jordan, the bar is set high,"" she said. ""Not just him as a player, but him as a businessman. And we've seen he's been pretty darn successful.""

Cincoro is now a sponsor of the Los Angeles Lakers, and Buss unveiled Tuesday a limited-edition añejo bottle in Lakers purple and gold. Buss said it's a nod to both the franchise's championship pedigree and the brand's premium positioning.

Oil prices fell Tuesday after Iran's foreign minister said progress was made during nuclear talks with the U.S., fueling hopes that negotiations could prevent another conflict in the Middle East. 

U.S. crude oil fell 61 cents, or 0.97%, to $62.28 per barrel by 10:26 a.m. ET. Global benchmark Brent was down $1.42, or 2.07%, to $67.23.

Iran and the U.S. reached a ""general agreement"" on Tuesday on guiding principles during talks in Geneva, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said, according to the semiofficial Tansim news agency.  Araghchi described talks with the U.S. as serious and constructive. 

Tensions remain high between Iran and the U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened strikes on the Islamic Republic if it does not cut a deal over its nuclear program.

Iran conducted war games Tuesday in the Strait of Hormuz, a trade choke point that is vital for international crude supplies. Traffic through the strait was suspended for several hours as Iran's Revolutionary Guard held naval exercises, according to the Tasnim news agency. 

About one-third of all waterborne crude oil exports pass through the strait, according to data from consulting firm Kpler. 

The Guard is prepared to close the Strait of Hormuz if ordered to do so, Rear Adm. Alireza Tangsiri said, according to the Tansim news agency.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Rev. Jesse Jackson, civil rights leader and former presidential candidate, dies at 84","https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/17/jesse-jackson-dead.html","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 10:10:07 GMT","



The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a civil rights icon, Baptist minister and two-time Democratic presidential candidate, died Tuesday at age 84.

The Jackson family confirmed his passing in a statement on Tuesday morning.

""Our father was a servant leader — not only to our family, but to the oppressed, the voiceless, and the overlooked around the world,"" his family said.

""We shared him with the world, and in return, the world became part of our extended family. His unwavering belief in justice, equality, and love uplifted millions, and we ask you to honor his memory by continuing the fight for the values he lived by.""

 He died peacefully surrounded by his family on Tuesday morning, the family said in their statement. Jackson is survived by his wife, Jacqueline, six children and multiple grandchildren.

The civil rights leader spent decades in the public eye fighting to end racial and class divisions in America.

A protege of Martin Luther King Jr., Jackson fought on the front lines of the battle against Jim Crow segregation laws as a college student. He stood out for his rousing speeches, radical ideas and passion for racial equality. Jackson would become a key figure in the civil rights movement that pressed for broader economic opportunities for Black people through the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, or SCLC, and more recently, his organization the Rainbow PUSH coalition. 

Jackson eventually transitioned into politics. In 1984 and 1988, he ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, winning multiple primaries and surpassing expectations each time. He based his campaigns on expanded equality for various racial minority groups, the working class and women.

Later, Jackson served as U.S. special envoy to Africa in the 1990s. He also acted as ""shadow senator"" for Washington, D.C., a role in which he lobbied for the district's statehood.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Jackson also negotiated the release of dozens of international hostages and prisoners, and became a vocal supporter of voting and LGBTQ rights. 

He was no stranger to controversy. During the 1984 presidential primary, he referred to Jews with the slur ""Hymies"" and called New York ""Hymietown"" in remarks he at first denied and later apologized for. ""Saturday Night Live"" lampooned the incident in a sketch featuring Eddie Murphy playing Jackson. And, in a testament to his stature in American political and popular culture, Jackson himself hosted ""SNL"" later that year.

In 2001, he admitted to having an extramarital affair that led to the birth of a daughter.

Jackson had been fighting Parkinson's disease since November 2017. In August 2021, he and his wife were hospitalized with Covid-19 at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. He was discharged in September after receiving successful treatment for the virus and Parkinson's disease. 

While Jackson had largely been absent from the political and civil rights main stage in recent years, he had taken every opportunity to renew pushes for equality. 

""If we played the big game, and the rules are not fair, and goals not clear and public, we would protest, but in politics we seem to make it alright, it's not alright,"" said Jackson in a 2018 podcast appearance. ""We want a system that's fair, and fairly applied. Americans want and deserve an even playing field with equal protection under the law, equal access and fairness.""

His family said Tuesday that it was his ""unwavering commitment to justice, equality and human rights"" that helped shape ""a global movement for freedom and dignity.""

""A tireless change agent, he elevated the voices of the voiceless—from his Presidential campaigns in the 1980s to mobilizing millions to register to vote—leaving an indelible mark on history,"" the statement said.

Jesse Louis Jackson was born Oct. 8, 1941, in Greenville, South Carolina, to Helen Burns and Noah Louis Robinson, a married man and former professional boxer. 

A year after Jackson was born, his mother married Charles Henry Jackson, a post office worker who later adopted him when he was 15.

Jackson grew up being taunted by other school children for his out-of-wedlock birth, which he said ultimately became his motivation to succeed. 

''It is where I get the drive to think I could change the South through the civil rights movement and run for President,'' Jackson told The New York Times in 1997. 

As a child, Jackson would know the harsh reality of the Jim Crow era, growing up at a time when racial segregation was in full force across the U.S. He attended all-Black public schools and was taught to sit at the back of buses and use ""colored"" restrooms and drinking fountains. 

After graduating from Greenville's Sterling High School in 1959, Jackson spent a year at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He then transferred to North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College, or A&T, a historically Black school in Greensboro, North Carolina. 

It was during his time at A&T that he first became active in the civil rights movement. Jackson joined the local Congress of Racial Equality chapter in Greensboro and participated in local protests and sit-ins against segregated public facilities. 

""I came out of Greensboro,"" Jackson told the Greensboro News & Record in 2015. ""It was my launching pad. All that I subsequently became in the movement came out of the lessons I learned in Greensboro.""

After being barred from accessing books at the public library and placed in jail for trying to use the same library for class work, Jackson said he felt the ""insult of segregation"" and the ""liberating power of going to jail for dignity,"" according to the News & Record. 

While home from college, he became a part of the Greenville Eight, a group of Black students who in 1960 protested the South Carolina city's segregated library system. Jackson and seven Black high school students refused to leave the whites-only Hughes Main Library and were arrested for ""disorderly conduct.""

Following their staged sit-in, the library system of the city became racially integrated.

It marked the beginning of what would become a lifetime career of civil rights activism. 

After graduating from A&T in 1964, Jackson pursued divinity studies at the Chicago Theological Seminary and began to organize student support for Martin Luther King Jr. 

On March 7, 1965, a day that would become known as Bloody Sunday, Jackson watched on television as club-wielding Alabama state troopers fired tear gas and charged at hundreds of nonviolent demonstrators who had just crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. The demonstrators were part of the historic marches from Selma to the Alabama capital of Montgomery to fight for Black civil and voting rights. 

A day after witnessing the violence on television, Jackson organized a caravan of seminary students to drive down to Alabama and join King in the Selma-to-Montgomery marches.

Jackson appeared at several commemorations of the marches, including an event hosted by former President Bill Clinton on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in 2000.  

""The blood of Selma set all of us free,"" Jackson said at the event, surrounded by several prominent civil rights leaders and then-President Clinton. ""How can I forget that season? My first-born son Jesse Jr. was born when we were marching here, I almost named him Selma."" 

""In Selma, America was reborn, democracy redefined, human rights redefined. The fruits of Selma are bountiful. And so today, we say to all of America, America won. One flag, one nation,"" Jackson said, drawing roaring applause. ""Not the flag of sedition and slavery and segregation. But one America, one flag.""

Impressed by Jackson's passion and organizational abilities during the marches, King gave him a staff position at the SCLC, the civil rights organization that King led until his death. Just three courses short of finishing his studies at the seminary, Jackson dropped out to pursue a full-time career in civil rights. Though he still became an ordained Baptist minister in 1968. 

In 1966, he was placed in charge of the Chicago branch of Operation Breadbasket, an SCLC initiative that monitored white companies' treatment of Black people and organized boycotts calling for fair hiring practices. 

While Jackson was seen by some in the SCLC as a ""loose cannon"" who worked too independently of others in the organization, his leadership was integral to the Chicago branch's success. Under Jackson, the Operation Breadbasket branch won 2,000 new jobs worth $15 million a year in new income to the Black community. 

He was promoted to national director of Operation Breadbasket in 1968, the same year King was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee. Jackson was a floor below King when he was shot dead at the Lorraine Motel on April 4, though he told reporters that the civil rights leader died in his arms, a claim that several King aides have disputed. 

""Every time I go back, it pulls a scab off and the wound is still raw. Every time, the trauma of the incident. His lying there. Blood everywhere. It hurts all the time,"" Jackson said in a 2018 interview with CNN. 

Jackson was embroiled in controversy after the assassination, with other SCLC leaders accusing him of using the organization and King's death for self-promotion. 

Ralph Abernathy, King's successor as chairman of the SCLC, told The New York Times in 1977, ""I hope God has forgiven [Jackson.]""

In 1971, Jackson formally resigned from the SCLC and founded Operation PUSH, or People United to Serve Humanity — his own Chicago-based civil rights organization that aimed to improve the economic conditions of Black communities across the U.S. Twenty-five years later, it would merge with the National Rainbow Coalition, Jackson's other civil rights organization that sought equal rights for the working class, women and racial minority groups. 

Since its establishment, Jackson has served as president of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, which aims to ""protect, defend, and gain civil rights by leveling the economic and educational playing fields,"" according to its website. 

Jackson's fame would escalate in 1984 when he ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, becoming the second Black American to launch a nationwide campaign for president. While pundits dismissed his candidacy, Jackson had a surprisingly strong run. 

He came in third in the competitive race for the Democratic nomination as Walter Mondale became the nominee, and would exceed expectations again when he ran for president a second time. In 1988, Jackson came in second behind nominee Michael Dukakis. 

But his unsuccessful presidential campaigns were not the end of his political career. In 1991, Jackson won election to an unpaid office of ""statehood senator,"" popularly known as ""shadow senator,"" to lobby the U.S. Congress for statehood for the District of Columbia. 

″Why D.C. statehood? Why not mayor?″ Jackson asked at a gathering of Democratic women in July 1990, The Associated Press reported. ″Because my life commitment is to expand democracy. My quest is not employment. It's empowerment.″

He would serve as a ""shadow senator"" until getting tapped by then-President Clinton to become the U.S. special envoy to Africa in 1997. 

""What joy, what privilege, what responsibility,"" Jackson said at his swearing-in ceremony. ""I called my mother; we prayed.""

""It is quite a journey from Haynie Street in Greenville, South Carolina. A happy home, but an environment of such low expectations, where our family was denied the right to vote, even though my father was an honorably discharged veteran of the army,"" Jackson said. ""From that to an assignment by the President and Secretary of State, to in some small measure, to help shape our foreign policy by building bridges between the U.S. and Africa.""

On several occasions, Jackson also worked independently to secure the release of prisoners held by anti-American regimes. 

He frustrated President Ronald Reagan's administration by traveling to Syria in 1983 to seek the release of a U.S. fighter pilot who had been held hostage by the Syrian government. That same year, he negotiated the release of 48 American and Cuban prisoners held hostage by the communist Cuban government. And in 1991, Jackson worked to free several hundred citizens hiding in Iraq and Kuwait before the Persian Gulf War. 

Jackson also advocated for the LGBTQ community when few prominent Democrats dared to do so, becoming the first speaker at a Democratic National Convention to mention gay and lesbian Americans.

He has been a long champion of voting rights as well. In August, he and others were arrested outside the U.S. Capitol during a demonstration calling for the end to the filibuster. 

""Black and Brown people are the base of the party. We're not the bottom. We're the foundation,"" Jackson told the crowd, according to The Washington Post. ""If we lose, they lose. If we lose, democracy loses. If we lose, Democrats lose. If we lose, the nation loses.""

Happy Tuesday, and happy Year of the Horse! I'm back after a week in Costa Rica, where I sampled coffee, memorized the USD-colón conversion rate and wished my Spanish was better.

S&P 500 futures are lower this morning. The stock market is coming off a losing week.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Wall Street didn't go into the holiday weekend on a winning note. While the latest inflation data came in cooler than expected, it wasn't enough to spark a recovery rally that could mitigate steep recent losses.

Here's what to know:

Rev. Jesse Jackson died today at 84 years old, his family confirmed in a statement. The civil rights icon and Baptist minister was a Martin Luther King Jr. protégé and two-time Democratic presidential candidate.

While a college student, Jackson was a crusader in the fight against Jim Crow segregation laws. He became a central figure in the broader civil rights movement, known for his work on the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Rainbow PUSH coalition.

""Our father was a servant leader — not only to our family, but to the oppressed, the voiceless, and the overlooked around the world,"" his family said in their statement. ""We shared him with the world, and in return, the world became part of our extended family. His unwavering belief in justice, equality, and love uplifted millions, and we ask you to honor his memory by continuing the fight for the values he lived by.""

Hyatt Hotels Chair Thomas Pritzker became the latest business mogul to step down from his position over ties to the late sex predator Jeffrey Epstein.

Pritzker said in a statement released yesterday that he held ""regret"" over his relationship with Epstein and that he ""exercised terrible judgment in maintaining contact."" The 75-year-old, who had been chair for more than two decades, said he'd resign from his post immediately and not seek reelection to the board.

With that announcement, Pritzker joined a growing list of business and political leaders leaving their positions as more details about Epstein's business dealings come to light. Goldman Sachs Legal Chief Kathryn Ruemmler and Paul Weiss Chair Brad Karp are among the latest corporate executives to resign.

Tech moguls are descending on India for an artificial intelligence summit this week, with OpenAI's Sam Altman, Alphabet's Sundar Pichai and Anthropic's Dario Amodei all expected to attend. Nvidia's Jensen Huang reportedly pulled out due to ""unforeseen circumstances.""

Altman announced over the weekend that Peter Steinberger, creator of the viral AI agent OpenClaw, is joining OpenAI. The news came as competition among generative AI firms heats up. OpenAI rival Anthropic saw its daily active user base grow 11% following its Super Bowl ad campaign that took a swipe at the ChatGPT maker.

Apple is entering the video podcasting realm. The tech giant announced yesterday that it would debut an integrated video podcasting experience in the spring.

As CNBC's Zach Vallese reports, this brings Apple's offerings closer to those of Spotify, YouTube and Netflix — all of which have leaned into video podcasting. Listeners will be able to toggle between watching or listening to shows in the Apple Podcasts app, and download video versions for offline viewing.

Meanwhile, Snap announced the launch of creator subscriptions as it aims to diversify revenue beyond ads. Creators on the ap will be able to earn income directly from their most loyal followers through paid memberships in a model similar to that of Patreon and Substack.

Here's what we're keeping an eye on in this holiday-shortened trading week:

In this article

U.S. Treasury yields were relatively unchanged on Tuesday as investors looked ahead to more delayed data releases during the holiday-shortened trading week.

The 10-year Treasury yield dropped less than 1 basis point to 4.052%, while the 30-year Treasury bond yield fell more than 1 basis point to 4.682%. The 2-year Treasury note yield was more than 2 basis points higher at 3.437%.

One basis point equals 0.01%, and yields move inversely to prices.

The bond market was closed for Presidents' Day on Monday, and Tuesday is shaping up to be a quiet start to the week for investors, who are awaiting several economic data releases.

Investors are anticipating the FOMC minutes on Wednesday, which they will parse for insights on the last interest rate decision and future monetary policy.

They are also expecting more delayed economic data this week, including housing data for November and December on Wednesday, as well as December's personal consumption expenditures index on Friday, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge.

Traders are currently pricing in a 90% chance of the Fed keeping interest rates unchanged in a range between 350-375, per the CME FedWatch Tool.

Venture capitalists are doubling down on Render, a startup offering easy-to-use cloud infrastructure. On Tuesday it said it has raised $100 million in funding at a $1.5 billion valuation.

The lucrative cloud computing world, dominated by Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet, has become more competitive since the arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT assistant in 2022. Companies such as CoreWeave that rent out Nvidia graphics cards for training artificial intelligence models have grown into mature businesses. Meanwhile, people are asking AI models to write software for them, and seeking advice on where to run the new programs. 

Render is among the beneficiaries of this emerging dynamic. Its revenue growth is well above 100%, and more than 4.5 million developers use its tools, Anurag Goel, its co-founder and CEO, told CNBC in an interview. 

The startup was founded in 2018 and is based in San Francisco, with about 100 employees. Investors include 01A, Addition, Bessemer Venture Partners, General Catalyst and Georgian Partners. With the new capital, Render will hire additional technical staff members to build features. 

Render runs its software on Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. Recently, Render has also been testing the use of its own servers. Expanding the initiative might reduce Render's costs and yield lower prices.

""We get more control over the kinds of things we can do, but the cost basis is just very different,"" said Goel, who was the eighth employee at Stripe, the payment processor.

But greater reliance on in-house computing power brings new risks, because the company must ensure that it always has enough servers on hand. If the strategy works out, it could boost efficiency for customers, such as Alibaba, CBS, Hodinkee, Paradigm, Shopify and AI-fueled app builder Base44.

The founder of Base44, Maor Shlomo, had used AWS at his previous startup, Explorium, and this time he wanted something different. 

""I was all by myself, and so I was searching for services that can automate most of the stuff so that I don't need to deal with infrastructure, even if it will cost slightly more that,"" Shlomo said. He signed up for Render. 

After website builder Wix bought Base44 last June, Shlomo asked to invest in Render, given his experience. Now he's a shareholder and a customer.

""It's such a great product that we don't need someone that's focused only on Render,"" he said.

Before Render, there was Heroku, a pioneer of the platform as a service category that runs on top of AWS. Salesforce acquired it for about $217 million in 2011. Earlier this month, Salesforce said it was backing away from developing new features for Heroku.

""People now know that they're not going to add new features to it, so they're looking around for the most mature alternative,"" Goel said.

OpenAI — which has committed to spending more than $600 billion with the Amazon, Cerebras, CoreWeave, Microsoft and Oracle clouds in recent months — uses Render. The AI lab's Codex coding app allows people to deploy web apps they create on Render. Codex users can also choose to deploy their apps on Cloudflare, Netlify and Vercel. In September, Vercel said it raised capital at a $9.3 billion valuation. Goel said companies such as AI spreadsheet specialist Shortcut have moved to Render from Vercel.

It doesn't hurt that ChatGPT recommends that people consider Render in certain scenarios, Goel said.

""Chatbots have effectively, almost singlehandedly, grown our business,"" he said.

Alibaba Group has released its newest AI model series, featuring enhanced capabilities, as it faces intensifying competition in China's AI space with several models launched in the past week. 

The Qwen3.5 AI model comes in an open-weight version, which allows users to download, run, fine-tune, and deploy it on their own infrastructure. Alibaba also released a ""hosted version,"" meaning the model can run on Alibaba's own servers.  

Both models were made available on Monday, the eve of the Chinese New Year, and come just a week after Alibaba released a new AI model designed for robots. 

The company highlighted that Qwen3.5 offers improvements in performance and cost and was built with ""native multimodal capabilities,"" enabling the models to understand text, images and video simultaneously within one system.

Leaning into a major AI trend this year, the model also supports new coding and agentic capabilities and is compatible with open-source AI agents like those from OpenClaw, which recently surged in popularity. 

AI agents are systems that can independently take actions and complete multi-step tasks on a user's behalf with minimal supervision. 

These agents and their abilities have garnered a lot of attention in recent weeks, after American AI company Anthropic released new agent tools. The potential for these agents to replace the work of software as a service companies, amongst others, has rocked markets. 

Alibaba's local competitors such as ByteDance and Zhipu AI also released upgraded models in the past week aimed at supporting more agent capabilities.

Marc Einstein, research director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC that artificial intelligence companies are preparing for the possibility that AI agents could ""upend traditional Internet business models.""

""If this happens the consequences for those who are not prepared will be severe and [Chinese AI companies] are aware of this,"" he said. 

Alibaba said that its new Qwen3.5 open-weight model comes with 397 billion parameters — variables that shape how an AI system learns and reasons. While less than its previous flagship model, the company said the latest model showed significant improvement based on self-reported benchmark evaluations.

Alibaba provided benchmark tests showing that Qwen3.5's performance was on par with leading models from OpenAI, Anthropic and Google DeepMind, though the comparisons were self-reported. 

Meanwhile, it also released a ""hosted model"" called the Qwen-3.5-Plus through its cloud platform Model Studio. Alibaba said this version also demonstrated performance on par with leading competitors. CNBC could not independently verify those claims.

The new Qwen3.5 models also support 201 languages and dialects, up from the previous generation's 82. Counterpoint's Einstein said this feature reflects Alibaba's global ambitions.

The company is expected to release more open-weight models during this Chinese New Year, Lin Junyang, technical lead of Alibaba Cloud's Qwen team said in a social media post.

Following the release of Anthropic's latest Claude AI agent tools, other American AI giants have been accelerating the development of agentic capabilities. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Sunday that the creator of the OpenClaw would be joining the company. 

Last month, Google DeepMind head Demis Hassabis told CNBC that Chinese AI models were just ""months"" behind Western rivals.

The dollar-debasement narrative is in full swing, as evidenced by the price of precious metals. However, one look at bitcoin, which should also rally on the debasement narrative, tells you something is amiss. We do not buy into the dollar-debasement narrative; instead, we believe much of the activity in gold and bitcoin is more closely related to speculative flows. Given our view, we think of both as trading vehicles and not hedges against calamity. Thus, the question we raise is whether this is the right time for gold holders to swap for bitcoin. To help time such a swap from gold to bitcoin, we use technical analysis of the bitcoin-to-gold price ratio, annotations, and a few bullet points to show you what we see. 

The prices of gold and bitcoin are extremely volatile. Therefore, those wanting to time a swap from gold to bitcoin must exercise caution. Moreover, while the trends and indicators point to a reversal, the narrative remains strong, and the divergence between gold and bitcoin can certainly persist.

Economy

Yesterday, the markets were closed in observance of Presidents' Day. Therefore, let's review where the market ended on Friday and the setup for this coming week. Overall, the S&P 500 continues to fail at previous all-time highs and has shifted toward distribution in recent weeks. Price pushed to a new intraday high last Monday at 6,980.10, then reversed into the close and spent Tuesday and Wednesday stalling near 6,941. That sequence matters because it left a clear supply shelf under the prior peak and set the stage for the selloff on Thursday as buyers failed, and sellers pressed the tape into the close, ending at 6,832.76, a 1.6% drop and the second-worst day since Thanksgiving, according to the Associated Press market recap. Then, on Friday, that market attempted a rebound but faded into the close, keeping prices below the broken shelf near 6,940 and closing at 6,836.17. As such, the bounce reads as corrective, not trend repair.

Overall, the market has remained in a broad consolidation pattern since last October, and February is returning to its statistical nature of weakness. While the market remains close to all-time highs, there has been a vicious rotation from growth to value. Looking at the market on a technical basis, the Thursday selloff broke support at both the 20- and 50-day moving averages, as money flows turned negative. Momentum and relative strength continue to decline, suggesting that buyers are becoming more scarce, at least in the near term. The selling pressure remained mostly contained to Megacap names, which is what pulled the broader index lower, but the rotation from growth to value is getting very extended.

Volatility has also been steadily rising, but so far it remains relatively contained. Technically, the key is the 6,940 to 6,975 band, which is the prior close cluster and the breakdown launch zone. If the index reclaims that area and holds it, the path opens back toward 6,980 and the 7,000 handle. If price fails there, rallies invite sellers, and the market stays range-bound, potentially heading to lower levels. Currently, support sits at 6,790 to 6,825, defined by Thursday's low and Friday's undercut and reversal. A clean break below that band increases the odds of a move toward 6,780, then 6,720. Next week is also shortened by the Presidents Day market closure on Monday, February 16, which often amplifies moves around well-defined levels.

CPI was slightly better than expected. The monthly core CPI rate was 0.3% as expected, but the inclusive CPI was 0.1% better than expectations at 0.2%. The year over year CPI rate fell to 2.4% from 2.7% last month. The graph below, courtesy of Bloomberg, shows the primary contributors to the CPI calculation. Core services constitute the large majority of CPI, and as shown, they are starting to decline. This is a promising trend that, if it continues in time, should help CPI reach the Fed's 2% target sooner than expected. 

This holiday-shortened week will be much quieter on the economic front than last week. The FOMC minutes on Wednesday will likely show the Fed is in no hurry to lower rates. That said, it will be interesting to see if they mention the divergence between Truflation and CPI. PCE Prices will be released on Friday. Current expectations are in line with Friday's CPI data. 

The article from the Wall Street Journal titled “Why My Generation Is Turning to Financial Nihilism” by Kyla Scanlon argues that Gen Z is embracing high-risk financial behavior out of despair and detachment. Of course, it is essential to recognize that Kyla, although well-intentioned, is a young twenty-something influencer with limited real-life experience, and sees things for “her generation” through a very narrow lens of “recency bias.”

Let's start with understanding that “Financial Nihilism” is a term used to describe an attitude where people believe financial decisions are meaningless because the system is rigged, the future is hopeless, or traditional paths to wealth are broken. The term “Financial Nihilism” was first coined in 2020 by Demetri Kofinas, a podcaster, who used it to describe his belief that speculative assets lack intrinsic value, driven by a loss of faith in traditional economic systems.

However, while this phrase has gained popularity in recent years, particularly following the GameStop short squeeze, crypto mania, and the rise of meme trading, it disappeared when all of that collapsed in 2022. However, after three years of unprecedented market gains in every asset class, from stocks to cryptocurrencies to precious metals, “Financial Nihilism” has resurfaced to rationalize “speculative excess” and justify abandoning long-term investment strategies that have withstood the “sands of time.”

While Kyla produced a bombastic article to gain social media exposure by suggesting that Gen Z and Millennials no longer believe in saving, investing, or following traditional financial paths, the data shows something very different.

None of these behaviors is nihilistic. They are practical and reflect economic constraints, not philosophical despair.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum's tokenized RWA market jumps more than 300% year over year as value tops $17 billion","https://www.theblock.co/post/390130/ethereum-tokenized-rwa-market-jump","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 11:15:39 GMT","

The Agora: Kaiko's institutional forum during EthCC. March 31, Cannes. Tickets Live

 Take a 30-second survey to help improve The Block. 

Ethereum's tokenized real-world asset market has topped $17 billion in value issued on its mainnet, according to The Block's data, as large players like BlackRock and JPMorgan continue bringing traditional funds onchain.

The figure represents a nearly 315% increase from a year earlier, when the sector was worth $4.1 billion, and reinforces Ethereum's dominance as the leading blockchain for tokenized finance. Ethereum currently accounts for approximately 34% of total onchain RWA value across all networks. Stablecoins on Ethereum mainnet have also climbed above $175 billion in aggregate market capitalization, underscoring the network's role as the primary settlement layer for tokenized dollar-denominated assets.



The growth highlights an accelerating shift by traditional financial institutions toward blockchain-based versions of familiar products. Wall Street incumbents, including BlackRock and JPMorgan, are building blockchain-native payments, savings, and investment instruments on Ethereum.

BlackRock's tokenized Treasury fund, BUIDL, has emerged as the flagship product in the category. Launched in 2024 via Securitize, the fund invests in short-term U.S. government securities and has grown to become the largest tokenized money-market vehicle on public blockchain infrastructure.

Earlier this month, BlackRock expanded BUIDL's utility by enabling direct onchain trading through UniswapX in collaboration with Securitize and Uniswap Labs, marking one of the clearest intersections yet between institutional capital and decentralized finance.

JPMorgan has also entered the arena. In December, the bank launched its first tokenized money-market fund on Ethereum, seeding it with $100 million and targeting qualified investors. The move builds on the firm's broader blockchain strategy and signals that tokenized yield products are gaining traction beyond crypto-native issuers.

Recent market activity suggests the momentum is not confined to Treasuries alone. This week, Wintermute launched institutional trading for tokenized gold, forecasting that the tokenized commodities segment could reach $15 billion in 2026. Commodities already represent more than $5 billion of Ethereum's RWA footprint.



The surge in Ethereum-based RWAs also aligns with broader projections from major financial institutions. Standard Chartered has previously estimated that tokenized real-world assets could reach $2 trillion by 2028, with the vast majority issued on Ethereum. ARK Invest has projected that tokenized assets could climb to roughly $11 trillion by 2030 from current levels.

Harvard rotates a portion of BTC holdings into ETH

Steak ‘n' Shake says Bitcoin adoption dramatically increased sales

Andre Cronje opens Flying Tulip sale to the public at $1B valuation

The smartest money in the room is rotating.

In a 13F filing with the SEC, Harvard disclosed that it trimmed 1.46M shares of BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) during Q4, bringing that position down to approximately $265M.

At the same time, it opened a brand-new position of 3,873,044 shares in BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust, worth roughly $86.8M.

Harvard Cuts Bitcoin ETF Stake, Adds Ethereum Exposure in Q4 Filing

Overall, their combined spot crypto ETF exposure at quarter-end topped just over $352M.

Harvard first disclosed a $116M IBIT position in August 2025. By November, it had tripled those holdings to roughly $350M.

Now they've trimmed BTC and rotated capital into ETH.

Sean Bill, co-founder and CIO of Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company, told Decrypt that Harvard is likely “making a relative value trade with the belief that ETH is undervalued relative to BTC.”

Jennifer Ouarrag, Head of Legal at institutional staking provider Twinstake, described it as a “recalibration toward assets with multiple return drivers,” noting that while Bitcoin remains “the primary institutional store-of-value proxy,” Ethereum “offers exposure to a broader smart-contract ecosystem.”

Harvard selling Bitcoin? Not great.

Harvard selling Bitcoin to buy ETH? Well, that's a bit more interesting.

There is more and more evidence that ETH is entering the crypto conversation alongside Bitcoin as the clear #2 asset to buy.

BlackRock talks about ETH perhaps more than Bitcoin these days.

And now major institutions are tracking the BTC / ETH ratio, looking at which asset has underperformed, and making portfolio decisions based on the analysis.

That seems like a bet that both ETH and BTC will be around for a while, and that both will have a real shot to find new ATHs.

They are very different assets though, and it would have been interesting to hear more from Harvard on those differences.

Bitcoin is a store of value play. ETH is a productive asset (see Tom Lee's Bitmine and their weekly staking yield). Plus, it's infrastructure, along with smart contract, and privacy, and perhaps even the AI integration layer.

There are plenty of reasons to be bullish on ETH and in some ways, moreso than even Bitcoin.

Harvard seems to agree…

Crypto majors are slightly red down 1%; BTC -1% at $68K; ETH even at $1,970; SOL even at $85; XRP -2% at $1.45

Penny Crosman (00:04):

Welcome to the American Banker Podcast. I'm Penny Crosman. In several recent projects, Ethereum has been the distributed ledger of choice among financial institutions. Fidelity Investments launched its stablecoin, Fidelity Digital Dollar, on Ethereum, JPMorganChase, Citi, Vantage Bank and Custodia Bank all use Ethereum on some level for their tokenized deposits. I'm not sure everyone understands what Ethereum is and how it's different from other distributed ledger options like Solana and Hyperledger. So I brought in Paul Brody, global blockchain leader at EY and chairman of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, who knows everything there is to know about Ethereum. Welcome, Paul.

Paul Brody (00:48):

Welcome. Thank you. I'm sure that somebody like Vitalik [Buterin, creator of Ethereum] might disagree that I know everything there is to know about Ethereum, but I will say that I know a fair amount and I've been around for a while.

Penny Crosman (00:59):

You know more than I do, so that will suffice for this podcast. So let's start with the most basic question. What is Ethereum? Can you tell us a little bit about the history of it and kind of paint a picture of what it is?

Paul Brody (01:15):

Absolutely. So Ethereum is the OG smart contract blockchain. And its origin dates back to I think about 2013 or early 2014 when people were really starting to get into Bitcoin. And I was actually one of those people when I was back at IBM. We were building some distributed computing work on Bitcoin. And what we discovered very quickly is that Bitcoin is not programmable. It is a distributed computing system that is very clever in its ability to distribute work and get consensus on important decisions, but it doesn't let you do very much. And so very early on, Vitalik Buterin and a few other people had this idea, Hey, we need something like Bitcoin. But instead of it just being for money, we want to have this idea of a world computer, a computer that can be distributed across the entire world and can reach consensus, not just on payments and transactions, but on any arbitrary type of software work. And that was the original concept of Ethereum. That's how I got introduced to it. We were struggling to make some stuff work with Bitcoin, and when a member of my team came to me and said, Paul, we could do this, but with this thing called Ethereum, we've met this guy, he's got this idea, it's going to be faster and fully programmable. It's like, yes, that is what we want. And so that is the origin of Ethereum, which is this idea of it is the original programmable blockchain system

Penny Crosman (02:47):

And applications can be written for it and smart contracts can be written for it. Can you say a little bit about that?

Paul Brody (02:57):

Yes. So basically Ethereum and small contract blockchains generally are made up of three things. This is kind of how I think about it. Number one, they contain tokens, which are just the items of value: money, assets, et cetera. Number two, they have wallets which are user IDs, user identification. It's where you keep your items of value. And then lastly, they have smart contracts. And you can use smart contracts to really do two things. Number one, you can use a smart contract to define any type of asset. This is really important. You can define an asset, it can be a fungible asset, a non fungible asset. It can be pegged to the U.S. dollar, it could be pegged to gold, it could be calculated in some way. So you can use a smart contract to define an asset, and you can also use a smart contract to define how two parties might interact or exchange assets or many parties might do.

(03:57):

So basically write a sort of computer program around that. And when I fully understood this, and it took me a while to fully understand it, but when I fully understood this, I had this light bulb moment, which is that basically every business deal on earth is some variation of a very simple framework, which is that one party has money and the other party has stuff and we're exchanging money for stuff. That's it under the terms of some kind of agreement, that's it, that represents 100% of all the business agreements on earth. And with those things, tokens and smart contracts, I can define the money, I can define the stuff and I can define the terms of an agreement, therefore I can run any business agreement that I can think of in this Ethereum ecosystem. It was like this light bulb went on my head. It was like, oh my gosh, this is going to be revolutionary.

Penny Crosman (04:50):

And what are some of the top use cases today for Ethereum for financial services?

Paul Brody (04:57):

So the main one, the one that has kind of really come out from the beginning as the blockbuster use case are stablecoins. Although people spend a lot of time worrying about cryptocurrency, by far, the thing that people want is they want regular currencies, but they want to make them programmable and transactable. They want to be able to do things like borrow against the value of their assets or send payments easily and quickly. And this completely open, decentralized, smart contract system allowed people to define money and start building applications on top of it with a speed and flexibility that just isn't possible in the traditional financial system, so on. And then on this base of stablecoins, which are dollars or euros or yen, but mostly dollars, you can layer on top of that, any other type of business agreement. You can do inventory tracking, procurement, structured lending, perpetual futures you can do. Any kind of financial transaction that you can do in a traditional exchange, you can turn into a piece of software and run it on Ethereum.

Penny Crosman (06:13):

You mentioned the speed of it and you wrote a BankThink for American Banker, an op-ed for us, where you said in its early days, Ethereum could not handle high volumes of high-speed transactions, but now it can handle 200 to 450 million transactions a day. What made that possible?

Paul Brody (06:33):

So the thing that made that possible, and the thing that really is, I would call it the secret sauce of Ethereum success over the decade is the fact that the Ethereum Foundation and the Ethereum ecosystem have continually been making updates and improvements. The original version wasn't very fast at all. It was a 1.0 version and it was clunky and clumsy and complicated and every six to nine months and getting a little bit more quickly. Recently, the Ethereum ecosystem has been releasing a new iteration of the core software, and over the last decade or so, there's been three really big transformational changes that have come from these software releases. The first is its transition from proof of work to proof of stake, and this basically changed how Ethereum validates transactions to make it vastly more efficient. It basically reduced the carbon footprint of transaction processing by 99.9%.

(07:44):

Secondly, the Ethereum ecosystem created Layer-2 networks. These are basically ways to scale the network infrastructure so that you can add your own proprietary attachment network to Ethereum. And this was done to make the network faster so you could sort of add capacity, have sort of little network shards that ran things independently and then synced up together with the main net. But it turned out to be incredibly valuable. And one of the big reasons why banks and other entities choose Ethereum is because any arbitrary corporation, business, whatever, you can set up your own mini network on top of Ethereum. So you can tap into the ecosystem's robustness, you can tap into the liquidity of the whole ecosystem. You can borrow from the security of the ecosystem, but you can build your own private infrastructure. One of the reasons why it's so compelling is that it's like a halfway house between having your own private blockchain and being on a public blockchain. And that's why you have Robinhood and Anchorage and Coinbase and so many companies not just building on Ethereum but building their own layer to private networks.

Penny Crosman (09:01):

Oh, sorry.

Paul Brody (09:02):

Sorry. There was one more change, which is that Ethereum itself is rearchitecting itself simply to handle many more transactions at the main net level as well. So it's scaling effectively in both a horizontal and a vertical manner.

Penny Crosman (09:18):

So if a bank decided it wanted to launch a stablecoin or a tokenized deposit or some other kind of asset on Ethereum, how big of a tech lift, how much technology effort and resources would have to be put into such a project?

Paul Brody (09:37):

Actually, remarkably little. So one of the big attractions of using a public blockchain is that you're tapping into this vast existing public infrastructure. So there's a ton of service providers, there's a ton of software built, there's open standards, the whole programming language, the Ethereum virtual machine is a widely used open standard. So the tech lift to launch these things is much smaller and much cheaper than, say, building your own private network. That's a big attraction. And you get to leverage all the existing standards. So you can, in theory at this point, you could white label the whole thing and you get other people to do it, and you could get it done very, very quickly. Startups are doing these things with three or four people and some good AI coding tools. I think the big thing that is in this space, it's worth spending money on is security and risk management. It's very easy to launch a token. It's very hard to make sure that if you are doing something that involves moving money, you need to really think more like a bank. And it's not the launching that's hard, it's the sustained security and vigilance that's important.

Penny Crosman (10:53):

So I think some banks are waiting for firm guidance from their regulators before they go too far down this road, as they've gone down this road in the past and then they've had to backtrack due to various problems in the past, like FTX's collapse and so forth. How much can they do today without worrying about what the regulators think?

Paul Brody (11:20):

Today in the U. S., the answer is almost everything. And I wouldn't say that they can do things without worrying about what the regulators think, but I think that what they can do is that they can do things without worrying that they will be arbitrarily singled out for a particular reason. So there's just a lot more confidence that the regulators are interested in constructively finding solutions to all the open issues. One European regulator described the U.S. environment as in a shifting from one of enforcement without rules to one that's much more rules-based and that makes people much more confident. The GENIUS Act in particular really opened the floodgates because that was very focused on stable coins. Stablecoins are the building blocks of almost all these types of applications. So once the floodgates were open with the Genius Act, people felt comfortable launching them. And that's why you've seen so many stablecoin announcements in particular. And although it's not come quite as fast, we're going to see a similar good number of tokenized securities things come. It'll again, be much faster if the Clarity Act gets passed, but even if it doesn't, it'll still move on at a pretty decent pace.

Penny Crosman (12:42):

So you're chairman of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. What is that? What exactly does it do?

Paul Brody (12:49):

We are an industry group for companies that are building their businesses in Ethereum, and we are set up as a talking shop for people to do. So we have the antitrust infrastructure to allow industry members to come together and discuss certain topics about things like technical standards, evolution of business models and things like that. Largely, we host events, meetups, conversations, networking. We are very explicitly not a lobbying organization, but we do host lots of discussions with policymakers and try to hear what they're saying and get their message out to the industry.

Penny Crosman (13:32):

And who are some of its members? Any names we might recognize?

Paul Brody (13:36):

Well, of course EY, Microsoft, JPMorgan. We just announced today actually Polygon is rejoining. I think Accenture is a member currently. So there's a ton of companies. We've got block apps, consensus, we have a huge range. I think we have about 75 members right now. We have a huge range of companies from very small crypto native startups to some of the world's largest banks.

Penny Crosman (14:05):

What other challenges do you think people might need to work through if they're thinking about working with Ethereum and how do they work through those?

Paul Brody (14:15):

So I think right now, Ethereum, the technology industry loves the standard. And if you think of Ethereum, not as a FinTech or financial tech item, but as just a general programming environment, it's showing all the hallmarks of becoming a standard like Windows or TCP/IP. So I personally think Ethereum itself is on a very good path. I think more generally for banks and financial institutions that are trying to navigate this blockchain and digital asset ecosystem, one of the most important challenges that they have to deal with right now where there's two challenges in particular that I'm starting to hear a lot about from clients. The first is that historically in banking and finance, every product market had its own unique tech stack. So the stock market was one system, the bond market was another system, the banking system was another system, and they were all completely different. Blockchains mushed them all together, one set of infrastructure that handles every asset, and that is very disruptive to the internal mechanics of how a lot of banks work. So that's one thing that they're trying to navigate because their whole technology infrastructure historically is siloed by its market type.

(15:45):

Second big issue that banks and other enterprises need to think about is that the crypto ecosystem, the blockchain digital asset ecosystem is not one unified market. It's actually several different markets. And it's really important to understand where your customers are coming from and who you're actually serving. And what I mean by this is a lot of the great long-term historical participation in this marketplace has come from people outside the United States who've been shut out of the traditional banking system, particularly the U.S. banking system. So if you go look at a lot of these crypto native apps, especially just the fully decentralized wallet based applications, their users are all over the world, but especially in emerging markets. And a big part of the demand for U.S. dollars comes from the fact that these users, they often operate in countries that don't have really robust independent central banks and stable currencies.

(16:49):

So one thing that's going on is you have this massive emerging markets group. They have an entirely different set of needs and requirements and customer issues than the new set of customers that's driving explosive growth right now, which are western institutions that want to use stable coins to drive down their operating costs by shifting away from traditional international payments or traditional complex contract management systems. Those companies have an entire, so if you're a shop owner in a small country and you have an individual self-hosted wallet, you are not so fussy about what the regulations say because your local equivalent to the SEC doesn't have the time or energy to prosecute you for the $50,000 you're holding. But if you're a big bank, you care a lot about being fully inside the regulated infrastructure. These two markets are operating in the same infrastructure. The dollars are flowing across this ecosystem.

(17:51):

It's very important to understand though that what you can sell to a small business owner in an emerging market who's dealing in a legal gray area, the gray economy in U.S. dollars is very different than what you can do between a big US corporation and their overseas subsidiary. We often get requests from clients like, Hey, we would love to use stable coins instead of whatever our currency is to interact with our parent company in the us. Can we do that? And we have to tell them, no, you can't because you guys can't afford to operate in a legal gray area, and you're definitely big enough that your local regulators are going to care about this, and we certainly can't help you do something that might not be legal.

Penny Crosman (18:35):

Interesting.

Paul Brody (18:36):

So this is a multi-track market and everybody needs to keep that in mind as they think about where their money is going.

Penny Crosman (18:44):

Education • 6 min read Bitcoin vs. Altcoins: Which Market Phase is Dominating – and What it Means for Investors  By Bitpanda 17.02.2026   At times, Bitcoin seems to pull the entire crypto market along with it; at others, altcoins suddenly take center stage, significantly outperforming the flagship currency. For many investors, this raises the same recurring question: Which market phase is currently dominating, and why does leadership shift so regularly between Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins? A look at past market cycles reveals that these shifts are no coincidence. Instead, Bitcoin and altcoins follow recurring patterns closely linked to capital flows, risk appetite, and market sentiment. By understanding how these market phases function, investors can better interpret price movements – without overreacting to short-term fluctuations or drawing the wrong conclusions. Key takeaways The crypto market goes through recurring phases where either Bitcoin or altcoins take the lead. Bitcoin typically dominates during defensive market phases, while altcoins tend to outperform when risk appetite increases. Which assets perform better is rarely a matter of chance; it is driven by capital rotation, market sentiment, and liquidity.  The anatomy of the bitcoin-altcoin rotation since 2023 The current market cycle traces back to November 2022. Following an all-time high of approximately €58,000 in November 2021, Bitcoin plummeted to around €15,500 – a drawdown of roughly 73%. While significant, such sharp corrections are not unusual for Bitcoin. In previous cycles, we saw crashes of approximately -86% in 2014/15 and -84% in 2018/19. It is notable that these drawdowns from all-time highs have trended smaller over time, a pattern suggesting increasing market stability. Following this bottom, a new upward trend emerged. However, this recovery was not linear. Instead, the subsequent market cycle can be divided into several distinct phases, each characterized by shifting leadership between Bitcoin and altcoins. Phase 1 (2023): Bitcoin recovery without altcoin participation From November 2022 through late 2023, Bitcoin completely dominated the market. While Bitcoin surged from €15,500 to nearly €39,000 (+151%), most altcoins lagged significantly behind. The Altcoin Season Index, which measures how many of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period, remained largely below 30. Phase 2 (Q1 2024): First selective altcoin movements At the start of 2024, Bitcoin sat at roughly €40,000. During this phase, specific altcoin sectors began to perform, particularly Layer-1 blockchains and AI tokens. In March 2024, the Altcoin Season Index spiked for the first time in a long while, though it only briefly crossed the 75 threshold. Phase 3 (Late 2024): Brief altcoin rally In November 2024, Bitcoin's relative strength weakened, briefly shifting the spotlight to altcoins. By December, the Altcoin Season Index peaked at 88, crossing the critical 75-mark. However, a sustained or broad-based ""Altcoin Season"" failed to materialize. While individual assets like XRP, Cardano, and Solana posted significant gains, the majority of altcoins continued to underperform relative to Bitcoin. Phase 4 (2025-2026): Return to Bitcoin dominance Since the beginning of 2025, relative market strength has once again shifted heavily in favor of Bitcoin. The Altcoin Season Index dropped to extreme lows during this period, occasionally hitting levels around 12 – values historically rare that indicate pronounced Bitcoin dominance. Although there was a short-lived spike in June 2025 where the index briefly rose above 75, this surge was fleeting and coincided with a period of heightened market euphoria surrounding new Bitcoin all-time highs. Since then, the Altcoin Season Index has retreated noticeably and currently sits at approximately 41 (as of February 2026).   The trajectory of the Altcoin Season Index illustrates a systematic rotation: starting from deep Bitcoin dominance in 2023 (values below 30), moving through selective spikes in 2024, and leading to the current return to form in early 2026. Over an extended period, no sustained altcoin outperformance has managed to establish itself. Instead, Bitcoin has once again dominated market movement, while altcoins have shown only isolated pockets of strength. This development highlights a market phase where capital remains heavily concentrated in Bitcoin and risk appetite remains constrained. Why Bitcoin usually leads crypto cycles It is no coincidence that Bitcoin often spearheads new market cycles. Recoveries following major corrections typically begin with Bitcoin before altcoins follow suit. Three central structural factors can be identified for this: 1. High liquidity and market depth Bitcoin is by far the most liquid asset in the crypto market. Large capital inflows, particularly from institutional investors, can be deployed efficiently here without causing extreme market distortion. Therefore, new demand initially concentrates on Bitcoin. 2. Perception as a relatively defensive asset Within the crypto sector, Bitcoin is considered less speculative than most altcoins. In early recovery phases or following market crises, investors tend to prefer assets with lower relative risk before increasing their exposure to more volatile plays. 3. The established ""digital gold"" narrative Bitcoin is increasingly perceived as a long-term store of value. This narrative gains significant traction during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty, reinforcing Bitcoin's role as the primary entry point for capital entering the crypto market. Bitcoin dominance: a key indicator for market phases A central tool for categorizing this dynamic is Bitcoin Dominance, Bitcoin's share of the total crypto market capitalization. It indicates whether capital is primarily concentrating in Bitcoin or flowing increasingly into altcoins. As of February 2026, Bitcoin dominance stands at approximately 58-60%. In volatile market phases, this high value reflects a clear ""flight to liquidity"": while the broader market corrects, altcoins often suffer disproportionate losses, which stabilizes Bitcoin's relative market share.  Market Share Comparison: This chart visualizes Bitcoin's long-term dominance relative to the total crypto market capitalization. Historically, the 60% mark has acted as significant resistance; for traders, a sustained decline below this level is often viewed as a technical signal marking the beginning of a new Altcoin Season. Bitcoin vs. altcoins: who performs better in which phase? The relative performance between the flagship currency and the rest of the market is not static; it is closely tied to the specific market phase. Three characteristic scenarios can be observed: 1. Bullish phases (Expansion) In the early stages of a bull market, Bitcoin usually takes the lead as fresh capital flows first into the most liquid asset. Only during a period of consolidation at high price levels, when Bitcoin begins to trend sideways, does the rotation into altcoins begin. Due to their lower market capitalisation, altcoins often act as a levered play, capable of significantly outperforming Bitcoin in the short term. 2. Sideways markets (Accumulation) In phases without a clear trend, the market often behaves selectively. While Bitcoin functions as a defensive anchor with decreasing volatility, interest tends to concentrate on specific niches (e.g., AI tokens or Layer-1 solutions). This leads to isolated pockets of strength rather than broad-based altcoin outperformance. 3. Corrections (Deleveraging) Falling markets highlight the protective nature of market depth. While Bitcoin also undergoes significant corrections, it often remains more stable compared to many altcoins. Because investors tend to liquidate speculative positions first during times of crisis, altcoins usually lose disproportionate ground during these windows.  Conclusion: understanding dynamics instead of forcing them The analysis of market phases highlights one clear truth: there is no such thing as constant outperformance. Whether Bitcoin or altcoins take the lead is not a matter of chance; it is a direct result of current liquidity levels and the market's appetite for risk. Bitcoin as a defensive anchor: Especially during correction phases or early recovery cycles, the flagship currency provides a level of relative stability that altcoins often lack due to their lower market depth. Altcoins as a lever on risk: During periods of high euphoria, when Bitcoin's price tends to trend sideways, altcoins act as performance accelerators, though this comes at the cost of significantly higher volatility.  For investors, this means that portfolio structures do not have to be static; they can instead be guided by these cycles. Historical windows, such as Bitcoin's dominance in 2023 or the altcoin rally in the first half of 2021, demonstrate that patience is often the decisive factor. Outperformance is never guaranteed and depends heavily on which phase of the cycle we are currently navigating.

Whether Bitcoin or altcoins take the lead is not a matter of chance; it is a direct result of current liquidity levels and the market's appetite for risk. Bitcoin as a defensive anchor: Especially during correction phases or early recovery cycles, the flagship currency provides a level of relative stability that altcoins often lack due to their lower market depth. Altcoins as a lever on risk: During periods of high euphoria, when Bitcoin's price tends to trend sideways, altcoins act as performance accelerators, though this comes at the cost of significantly higher volatility.  For investors, this means that portfolio structures do not have to be static; they can instead be guided by these cycles. Historical windows, such as Bitcoin's dominance in 2023 or the altcoin rally in the first half of 2021, demonstrate that patience is often the decisive factor.

Key takeaways The crypto market goes through recurring phases where either Bitcoin or altcoins take the lead. Bitcoin typically dominates during defensive market phases, while altcoins tend to outperform when risk appetite increases. Which assets perform better is rarely a matter of chance; it is driven by capital rotation, market sentiment, and liquidity.  The anatomy of the bitcoin-altcoin rotation since 2023 The current market cycle traces back to November 2022. Following an all-time high of approximately €58,000 in November 2021, Bitcoin plummeted to around €15,500 – a drawdown of roughly 73%. While significant, such sharp corrections are not unusual for Bitcoin. In previous cycles, we saw crashes of approximately -86% in 2014/15 and -84% in 2018/19. It is notable that these drawdowns from all-time highs have trended smaller over time, a pattern suggesting increasing market stability. Following this bottom, a new upward trend emerged. However, this recovery was not linear. Instead, the subsequent market cycle can be divided into several distinct phases, each characterized by shifting leadership between Bitcoin and altcoins. Phase 1 (2023): Bitcoin recovery without altcoin participation From November 2022 through late 2023, Bitcoin completely dominated the market. While Bitcoin surged from €15,500 to nearly €39,000 (+151%), most altcoins lagged significantly behind. The Altcoin Season Index, which measures how many of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period, remained largely below 30. Phase 2 (Q1 2024): First selective altcoin movements At the start of 2024, Bitcoin sat at roughly €40,000. During this phase, specific altcoin sectors began to perform, particularly Layer-1 blockchains and AI tokens. In March 2024, the Altcoin Season Index spiked for the first time in a long while, though it only briefly crossed the 75 threshold. Phase 3 (Late 2024): Brief altcoin rally In November 2024, Bitcoin's relative strength weakened, briefly shifting the spotlight to altcoins. By December, the Altcoin Season Index peaked at 88, crossing the critical 75-mark. However, a sustained or broad-based ""Altcoin Season"" failed to materialize. While individual assets like XRP, Cardano, and Solana posted significant gains, the majority of altcoins continued to underperform relative to Bitcoin. Phase 4 (2025-2026): Return to Bitcoin dominance Since the beginning of 2025, relative market strength has once again shifted heavily in favor of Bitcoin. The Altcoin Season Index dropped to extreme lows during this period, occasionally hitting levels around 12 – values historically rare that indicate pronounced Bitcoin dominance. Although there was a short-lived spike in June 2025 where the index briefly rose above 75, this surge was fleeting and coincided with a period of heightened market euphoria surrounding new Bitcoin all-time highs. Since then, the Altcoin Season Index has retreated noticeably and currently sits at approximately 41 (as of February 2026).   The trajectory of the Altcoin Season Index illustrates a systematic rotation: starting from deep Bitcoin dominance in 2023 (values below 30), moving through selective spikes in 2024, and leading to the current return to form in early 2026. Over an extended period, no sustained altcoin outperformance has managed to establish itself. Instead, Bitcoin has once again dominated market movement, while altcoins have shown only isolated pockets of strength. This development highlights a market phase where capital remains heavily concentrated in Bitcoin and risk appetite remains constrained. Why Bitcoin usually leads crypto cycles It is no coincidence that Bitcoin often spearheads new market cycles. Recoveries following major corrections typically begin with Bitcoin before altcoins follow suit. Three central structural factors can be identified for this: 1. High liquidity and market depth Bitcoin is by far the most liquid asset in the crypto market. Large capital inflows, particularly from institutional investors, can be deployed efficiently here without causing extreme market distortion. Therefore, new demand initially concentrates on Bitcoin. 2. Perception as a relatively defensive asset Within the crypto sector, Bitcoin is considered less speculative than most altcoins. In early recovery phases or following market crises, investors tend to prefer assets with lower relative risk before increasing their exposure to more volatile plays. 3. The established ""digital gold"" narrative Bitcoin is increasingly perceived as a long-term store of value. This narrative gains significant traction during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty, reinforcing Bitcoin's role as the primary entry point for capital entering the crypto market. Bitcoin dominance: a key indicator for market phases A central tool for categorizing this dynamic is Bitcoin Dominance, Bitcoin's share of the total crypto market capitalization. It indicates whether capital is primarily concentrating in Bitcoin or flowing increasingly into altcoins. As of February 2026, Bitcoin dominance stands at approximately 58-60%. In volatile market phases, this high value reflects a clear ""flight to liquidity"": while the broader market corrects, altcoins often suffer disproportionate losses, which stabilizes Bitcoin's relative market share.  Market Share Comparison: This chart visualizes Bitcoin's long-term dominance relative to the total crypto market capitalization. Historically, the 60% mark has acted as significant resistance; for traders, a sustained decline below this level is often viewed as a technical signal marking the beginning of a new Altcoin Season. Bitcoin vs. altcoins: who performs better in which phase? The relative performance between the flagship currency and the rest of the market is not static; it is closely tied to the specific market phase. Three characteristic scenarios can be observed: 1. Bullish phases (Expansion) In the early stages of a bull market, Bitcoin usually takes the lead as fresh capital flows first into the most liquid asset. Only during a period of consolidation at high price levels, when Bitcoin begins to trend sideways, does the rotation into altcoins begin. Due to their lower market capitalisation, altcoins often act as a levered play, capable of significantly outperforming Bitcoin in the short term. 2. Sideways markets (Accumulation) In phases without a clear trend, the market often behaves selectively. While Bitcoin functions as a defensive anchor with decreasing volatility, interest tends to concentrate on specific niches (e.g., AI tokens or Layer-1 solutions). This leads to isolated pockets of strength rather than broad-based altcoin outperformance. 3. Corrections (Deleveraging) Falling markets highlight the protective nature of market depth. While Bitcoin also undergoes significant corrections, it often remains more stable compared to many altcoins.

Phase 1 (2023): Bitcoin recovery without altcoin participation From November 2022 through late 2023, Bitcoin completely dominated the market. While Bitcoin surged from €15,500 to nearly €39,000 (+151%), most altcoins lagged significantly behind. The Altcoin Season Index, which measures how many of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period, remained largely below 30. Phase 2 (Q1 2024): First selective altcoin movements At the start of 2024, Bitcoin sat at roughly €40,000. During this phase, specific altcoin sectors began to perform, particularly Layer-1 blockchains and AI tokens. In March 2024, the Altcoin Season Index spiked for the first time in a long while, though it only briefly crossed the 75 threshold. Phase 3 (Late 2024): Brief altcoin rally In November 2024, Bitcoin's relative strength weakened, briefly shifting the spotlight to altcoins. By December, the Altcoin Season Index peaked at 88, crossing the critical 75-mark. However, a sustained or broad-based ""Altcoin Season"" failed to materialize. While individual assets like XRP, Cardano, and Solana posted significant gains, the majority of altcoins continued to underperform relative to Bitcoin. Phase 4 (2025-2026): Return to Bitcoin dominance Since the beginning of 2025, relative market strength has once again shifted heavily in favor of Bitcoin. The Altcoin Season Index dropped to extreme lows during this period, occasionally hitting levels around 12 – values historically rare that indicate pronounced Bitcoin dominance. Although there was a short-lived spike in June 2025 where the index briefly rose above 75, this surge was fleeting and coincided with a period of heightened market euphoria surrounding new Bitcoin all-time highs. Since then, the Altcoin Season Index has retreated noticeably and currently sits at approximately 41 (as of February 2026).   The trajectory of the Altcoin Season Index illustrates a systematic rotation: starting from deep Bitcoin dominance in 2023 (values below 30), moving through selective spikes in 2024, and leading to the current return to form in early 2026. Over an extended period, no sustained altcoin outperformance has managed to establish itself. Instead, Bitcoin has once again dominated market movement, while altcoins have shown only isolated pockets of strength. This development highlights a market phase where capital remains heavily concentrated in Bitcoin and risk appetite remains constrained.

Recoveries following major corrections typically begin with Bitcoin before altcoins follow suit. Three central structural factors can be identified for this: 1. High liquidity and market depth Bitcoin is by far the most liquid asset in the crypto market. Large capital inflows, particularly from institutional investors, can be deployed efficiently here without causing extreme market distortion. Therefore, new demand initially concentrates on Bitcoin. 2. Perception as a relatively defensive asset Within the crypto sector, Bitcoin is considered less speculative than most altcoins. In early recovery phases or following market crises, investors tend to prefer assets with lower relative risk before increasing their exposure to more volatile plays. 3. The established ""digital gold"" narrative Bitcoin is increasingly perceived as a long-term store of value. This narrative gains significant traction during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty, reinforcing Bitcoin's role as the primary entry point for capital entering the crypto market. Bitcoin dominance: a key indicator for market phases A central tool for categorizing this dynamic is Bitcoin Dominance, Bitcoin's share of the total crypto market capitalization. It indicates whether capital is primarily concentrating in Bitcoin or flowing increasingly into altcoins. As of February 2026, Bitcoin dominance stands at approximately 58-60%. In volatile market phases, this high value reflects a clear ""flight to liquidity"": while the broader market corrects, altcoins often suffer disproportionate losses, which stabilizes Bitcoin's relative market share.  Market Share Comparison: This chart visualizes Bitcoin's long-term dominance relative to the total crypto market capitalization. Historically, the 60% mark has acted as significant resistance; for traders, a sustained decline below this level is often viewed as a technical signal marking the beginning of a new Altcoin Season. Bitcoin vs. altcoins: who performs better in which phase? The relative performance between the flagship currency and the rest of the market is not static; it is closely tied to the specific market phase. Three characteristic scenarios can be observed: 1. Bullish phases (Expansion) In the early stages of a bull market, Bitcoin usually takes the lead as fresh capital flows first into the most liquid asset. Only during a period of consolidation at high price levels, when Bitcoin begins to trend sideways, does the rotation into altcoins begin. Due to their lower market capitalisation, altcoins often act as a levered play, capable of significantly outperforming Bitcoin in the short term. 2. Sideways markets (Accumulation) In phases without a clear trend, the market often behaves selectively. While Bitcoin functions as a defensive anchor with decreasing volatility, interest tends to concentrate on specific niches (e.g., AI tokens or Layer-1 solutions). This leads to isolated pockets of strength rather than broad-based altcoin outperformance. 3. Corrections (Deleveraging) Falling markets highlight the protective nature of market depth. While Bitcoin also undergoes significant corrections, it often remains more stable compared to many altcoins. Because investors tend to liquidate speculative positions first during times of crisis, altcoins usually lose disproportionate ground during these windows.  Conclusion: understanding dynamics instead of forcing them The analysis of market phases highlights one clear truth: there is no such thing as constant outperformance. Whether Bitcoin or altcoins take the lead is not a matter of chance; it is a direct result of current liquidity levels and the market's appetite for risk. Bitcoin as a defensive anchor: Especially during correction phases or early recovery cycles, the flagship currency provides a level of relative stability that altcoins often lack due to their lower market depth. Altcoins as a lever on risk: During periods of high euphoria, when Bitcoin's price tends to trend sideways, altcoins act as performance accelerators, though this comes at the cost of significantly higher volatility.  For investors, this means that portfolio structures do not have to be static; they can instead be guided by these cycles. Historical windows, such as Bitcoin's dominance in 2023 or the altcoin rally in the first half of 2021, demonstrate that patience is often the decisive factor. Outperformance is never guaranteed and depends heavily on which phase of the cycle we are currently navigating.

From November 2022 through late 2023, Bitcoin completely dominated the market. While Bitcoin surged from €15,500 to nearly €39,000 (+151%), most altcoins lagged significantly behind. The Altcoin Season Index, which measures how many of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period, remained largely below 30. Phase 2 (Q1 2024): First selective altcoin movements At the start of 2024, Bitcoin sat at roughly €40,000. During this phase, specific altcoin sectors began to perform, particularly Layer-1 blockchains and AI tokens. In March 2024, the Altcoin Season Index spiked for the first time in a long while, though it only briefly crossed the 75 threshold. Phase 3 (Late 2024): Brief altcoin rally In November 2024, Bitcoin's relative strength weakened, briefly shifting the spotlight to altcoins. By December, the Altcoin Season Index peaked at 88, crossing the critical 75-mark. However, a sustained or broad-based ""Altcoin Season"" failed to materialize. While individual assets like XRP, Cardano, and Solana posted significant gains, the majority of altcoins continued to underperform relative to Bitcoin. Phase 4 (2025-2026): Return to Bitcoin dominance Since the beginning of 2025, relative market strength has once again shifted heavily in favor of Bitcoin. The Altcoin Season Index dropped to extreme lows during this period, occasionally hitting levels around 12 – values historically rare that indicate pronounced Bitcoin dominance. Although there was a short-lived spike in June 2025 where the index briefly rose above 75, this surge was fleeting and coincided with a period of heightened market euphoria surrounding new Bitcoin all-time highs. Since then, the Altcoin Season Index has retreated noticeably and currently sits at approximately 41 (as of February 2026).   The trajectory of the Altcoin Season Index illustrates a systematic rotation: starting from deep Bitcoin dominance in 2023 (values below 30), moving through selective spikes in 2024, and leading to the current return to form in early 2026. Over an extended period, no sustained altcoin outperformance has managed to establish itself. Instead, Bitcoin has once again dominated market movement, while altcoins have shown only isolated pockets of strength. This development highlights a market phase where capital remains heavily concentrated in Bitcoin and risk appetite remains constrained.

While individual assets like XRP, Cardano, and Solana posted significant gains, the majority of altcoins continued to underperform relative to Bitcoin. Phase 4 (2025-2026): Return to Bitcoin dominance Since the beginning of 2025, relative market strength has once again shifted heavily in favor of Bitcoin. The Altcoin Season Index dropped to extreme lows during this period, occasionally hitting levels around 12 – values historically rare that indicate pronounced Bitcoin dominance. Although there was a short-lived spike in June 2025 where the index briefly rose above 75, this surge was fleeting and coincided with a period of heightened market euphoria surrounding new Bitcoin all-time highs. Since then, the Altcoin Season Index has retreated noticeably and currently sits at approximately 41 (as of February 2026).   The trajectory of the Altcoin Season Index illustrates a systematic rotation: starting from deep Bitcoin dominance in 2023 (values below 30), moving through selective spikes in 2024, and leading to the current return to form in early 2026. Over an extended period, no sustained altcoin outperformance has managed to establish itself. Instead, Bitcoin has once again dominated market movement, while altcoins have shown only isolated pockets of strength. This development highlights a market phase where capital remains heavily concentrated in Bitcoin and risk appetite remains constrained. Why Bitcoin usually leads crypto cycles It is no coincidence that Bitcoin often spearheads new market cycles. Recoveries following major corrections typically begin with Bitcoin before altcoins follow suit. Three central structural factors can be identified for this: 1. High liquidity and market depth Bitcoin is by far the most liquid asset in the crypto market. Large capital inflows, particularly from institutional investors, can be deployed efficiently here without causing extreme market distortion. Therefore, new demand initially concentrates on Bitcoin. 2. Perception as a relatively defensive asset Within the crypto sector, Bitcoin is considered less speculative than most altcoins. In early recovery phases or following market crises, investors tend to prefer assets with lower relative risk before increasing their exposure to more volatile plays. 3. The established ""digital gold"" narrative Bitcoin is increasingly perceived as a long-term store of value. This narrative gains significant traction during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty, reinforcing Bitcoin's role as the primary entry point for capital entering the crypto market. Bitcoin dominance: a key indicator for market phases A central tool for categorizing this dynamic is Bitcoin Dominance, Bitcoin's share of the total crypto market capitalization. It indicates whether capital is primarily concentrating in Bitcoin or flowing increasingly into altcoins. As of February 2026, Bitcoin dominance stands at approximately 58-60%. In volatile market phases, this high value reflects a clear ""flight to liquidity"": while the broader market corrects, altcoins often suffer disproportionate losses, which stabilizes Bitcoin's relative market share.  Market Share Comparison: This chart visualizes Bitcoin's long-term dominance relative to the total crypto market capitalization. Historically, the 60% mark has acted as significant resistance; for traders, a sustained decline below this level is often viewed as a technical signal marking the beginning of a new Altcoin Season. Bitcoin vs. altcoins: who performs better in which phase? The relative performance between the flagship currency and the rest of the market is not static; it is closely tied to the specific market phase. Three characteristic scenarios can be observed: 1. Bullish phases (Expansion) In the early stages of a bull market, Bitcoin usually takes the lead as fresh capital flows first into the most liquid asset. Only during a period of consolidation at high price levels, when Bitcoin begins to trend sideways, does the rotation into altcoins begin. Due to their lower market capitalisation, altcoins often act as a levered play, capable of significantly outperforming Bitcoin in the short term. 2. Sideways markets (Accumulation) In phases without a clear trend, the market often behaves selectively. While Bitcoin functions as a defensive anchor with decreasing volatility, interest tends to concentrate on specific niches (e.g., AI tokens or Layer-1 solutions). This leads to isolated pockets of strength rather than broad-based altcoin outperformance. 3. Corrections (Deleveraging) Falling markets highlight the protective nature of market depth. While Bitcoin also undergoes significant corrections, it often remains more stable compared to many altcoins. Because investors tend to liquidate speculative positions first during times of crisis, altcoins usually lose disproportionate ground during these windows.  Conclusion: understanding dynamics instead of forcing them The analysis of market phases highlights one clear truth: there is no such thing as constant outperformance. Whether Bitcoin or altcoins take the lead is not a matter of chance; it is a direct result of current liquidity levels and the market's appetite for risk. Bitcoin as a defensive anchor: Especially during correction phases or early recovery cycles, the flagship currency provides a level of relative stability that altcoins often lack due to their lower market depth. Altcoins as a lever on risk: During periods of high euphoria, when Bitcoin's price tends to trend sideways, altcoins act as performance accelerators, though this comes at the cost of significantly higher volatility.

Over an extended period, no sustained altcoin outperformance has managed to establish itself. Instead, Bitcoin has once again dominated market movement, while altcoins have shown only isolated pockets of strength. This development highlights a market phase where capital remains heavily concentrated in Bitcoin and risk appetite remains constrained. Why Bitcoin usually leads crypto cycles It is no coincidence that Bitcoin often spearheads new market cycles. Recoveries following major corrections typically begin with Bitcoin before altcoins follow suit. Three central structural factors can be identified for this: 1. High liquidity and market depth Bitcoin is by far the most liquid asset in the crypto market. Large capital inflows, particularly from institutional investors, can be deployed efficiently here without causing extreme market distortion. Therefore, new demand initially concentrates on Bitcoin. 2. Perception as a relatively defensive asset Within the crypto sector, Bitcoin is considered less speculative than most altcoins. In early recovery phases or following market crises, investors tend to prefer assets with lower relative risk before increasing their exposure to more volatile plays. 3. The established ""digital gold"" narrative Bitcoin is increasingly perceived as a long-term store of value. This narrative gains significant traction during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty, reinforcing Bitcoin's role as the primary entry point for capital entering the crypto market. Bitcoin dominance: a key indicator for market phases A central tool for categorizing this dynamic is Bitcoin Dominance, Bitcoin's share of the total crypto market capitalization. It indicates whether capital is primarily concentrating in Bitcoin or flowing increasingly into altcoins. As of February 2026, Bitcoin dominance stands at approximately 58-60%. In volatile market phases, this high value reflects a clear ""flight to liquidity"": while the broader market corrects, altcoins often suffer disproportionate losses, which stabilizes Bitcoin's relative market share.  Market Share Comparison: This chart visualizes Bitcoin's long-term dominance relative to the total crypto market capitalization. Historically, the 60% mark has acted as significant resistance; for traders, a sustained decline below this level is often viewed as a technical signal marking the beginning of a new Altcoin Season. Bitcoin vs. altcoins: who performs better in which phase? The relative performance between the flagship currency and the rest of the market is not static; it is closely tied to the specific market phase. Three characteristic scenarios can be observed: 1. Bullish phases (Expansion) In the early stages of a bull market, Bitcoin usually takes the lead as fresh capital flows first into the most liquid asset. Only during a period of consolidation at high price levels, when Bitcoin begins to trend sideways, does the rotation into altcoins begin. Due to their lower market capitalisation, altcoins often act as a levered play, capable of significantly outperforming Bitcoin in the short term. 2. Sideways markets (Accumulation) In phases without a clear trend, the market often behaves selectively. While Bitcoin functions as a defensive anchor with decreasing volatility, interest tends to concentrate on specific niches (e.g., AI tokens or Layer-1 solutions). This leads to isolated pockets of strength rather than broad-based altcoin outperformance. 3. Corrections (Deleveraging) Falling markets highlight the protective nature of market depth.

As of February 2026, Bitcoin dominance stands at approximately 58-60%. In volatile market phases, this high value reflects a clear ""flight to liquidity"": while the broader market corrects, altcoins often suffer disproportionate losses, which stabilizes Bitcoin's relative market share.  Market Share Comparison: This chart visualizes Bitcoin's long-term dominance relative to the total crypto market capitalization. Historically, the 60% mark has acted as significant resistance; for traders, a sustained decline below this level is often viewed as a technical signal marking the beginning of a new Altcoin Season. Bitcoin vs. altcoins: who performs better in which phase? The relative performance between the flagship currency and the rest of the market is not static; it is closely tied to the specific market phase. Three characteristic scenarios can be observed: 1. Bullish phases (Expansion) In the early stages of a bull market, Bitcoin usually takes the lead as fresh capital flows first into the most liquid asset. Only during a period of consolidation at high price levels, when Bitcoin begins to trend sideways, does the rotation into altcoins begin. Due to their lower market capitalisation, altcoins often act as a levered play, capable of significantly outperforming Bitcoin in the short term. 2. Sideways markets (Accumulation) In phases without a clear trend, the market often behaves selectively. While Bitcoin functions as a defensive anchor with decreasing volatility, interest tends to concentrate on specific niches (e.g., AI tokens or Layer-1 solutions). This leads to isolated pockets of strength rather than broad-based altcoin outperformance. 3. Corrections (Deleveraging) Falling markets highlight the protective nature of market depth.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","XRP News Today: XRP Climbs as Market Structure Bill Spurs Buying","https://eand.co/xrp-news-today-xrp-climbs-as-market-structure-bill-spurs-buying","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 11:31:32 GMT","



As of February 17, 2026, leading cryptocurrencies, including XRP, have posted modest gains, with XRP crossing the $1.50 mark for the second time this month. Currently, XRP is trading at $1.47, with an intraday gain of 1%. Ongoing regulatory shifts, including advancements in the Market Structure Bill, have catalyzed XRP's short-term bullish outlook and helped stabilize the token near the immediate $1.50 support level. XRP began the week on a positive note, climbing to $1.61 for the first time this month and signaling renewed interest despite the broader long-term cryptocurrency market's downtrend. 

Market analysts have observed that the primary reason for the XRP uptrend is the technical rebound from oversold levels, with price holding above its 7-day moving average ($1.43). Price prediction analyses suggest that XRP's current momentum points to an emerging trend, with the digital asset on the verge of breaking new records. 

Standard Chartered's recent end-of-year target cut has become a heated topic within the XRP community and the broader crypto landscape. According to the latest reports, Standard Chartered, a 172-year-old British banking institution, reduced its XRP year-end target to $2.80. The 65% reduction is primarily due to the current crypto market weakness and a substantial decline in ETF inflows. The earlier prediction from the UK-based banking institution was $8, but XRP later faced significant challenges, dropping to near $1.15, its lowest trading price since the end of 2024. 

The recent changes in the market trend act as a major factor pushing XRP. Altcoin dominance is mildly active now, acting as a floor for the renewed momentum of altcoins. Latest market data indicated that the Altcoin Season Index was at 30, up from 24 a month earlier, which signaled a shift toward altcoins but still remained in a low, Bitcoin-leaning regime rather than a classic altcoin season.

Ripple recently introduced a new concept focused on institutional DeFi on XRPL, aiming to scale real-world finance with XRP at its core. Ripple's official document stated that the latest Institutional DeFi update had laid out how core features were being adopted, how XRP was being used to facilitate key institutional workflows, and where the roadmap was headed next. 

It added that with native on-chain privacy, permissioned markets, and institutional lending set to go live in the coming months, XRPL was positioning itself not just as a chain for tokenization, but as an end-to-end operating system for real-world finance. The initiative will boost XRP's market performance, dominance, and enhance its institutional adoption.

Crypto analyst King Jayden opined in an X post that XRP had surged 38% from its February lows, breaking above $1.65 before cooling near $1.50, and had outperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum in the process. He said the driver was real utility, explaining that Institutional DeFi was expanding on XRPL with lending, permissioned decentralized exchanges, and privacy-focused upgrades. He added that with leadership momentum from Brad Garlinghouse and growing regulatory alignment, the picture was becoming clearer. He concluded that it felt bigger than retail hype.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

A crypto worm is a very sneaky new type of malware that targets cryptocurrencies. According to research from top cybersecurity companies, cryptojacking is a self-propagating type of crypto-malware that spreads across networks on its own while silently installing scripts that hijack CPU resources for unlawful Bitcoin mining. 

Crypto worms are different from regular malware because they don't try to steal data or hold it for ransom right away. Instead, they work quietly and continuously, turning infected systems into silent miners that generate income for attackers over the long term.

A lot of research into blockchain security problems shows that crypto worms thrive in the decentralized yet sometimes poorly secured areas of public blockchains, wallets, and smart contract ecosystems. CrowdStrike researchers stress that crypto-malware, including worms, enables long-term cryptojacking by exploiting victims' processing power without their knowledge. 

This article draws on reliable sources to explain how crypto worms work, the threats they pose to the blockchain, the effects they have in the real world, and how to stop them.

Crypto worms are a type of crypto-malware, malicious software designed expressly for cryptojacking attacks. CrowdStrike's in-depth research shows that crypto-malware runs code in the background to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or the privacy-focused Monero, while remaining hidden for as long as possible. 

The worm variant can replicate itself. Once it gets into one device or node, it looks for weaknesses in connected networks, Docker containers, or blockchain-related apps to spread on its own. This sets crypto worms apart from other types of crypto-malware that don't copy themselves. 

Analysts note that typical crypto-malware typically gets into computers through phishing or compromised websites. Worms, on the other hand, propagate on their own by taking advantage of systems that haven't been patched or nodes that aren't safe. This makes them more widespread among blockchain participants and mining pools.

The first step in the life cycle of a crypto worm is infection, which typically occurs through phishing emails, malicious browser scripts, or compromised endpoints. Once inside, it uses mining payloads to solve difficult math problems that verify blockchain transactions and reward the attacker.

 In blockchain settings, worms attack nodes, wallets, or DeFi platforms, consuming CPU and GPU resources and potentially slowing consensus.

CrowdStrike experts say that “crypto-malware can run on its own and for an unlimited amount of time once it has been run on the victim's device.” This means that worms can stay on the victim's device even after it has been rebooted or moved to a different network segment.

 In decentralized ledgers, this can lead to attacks on network integrity that aren't direct, such as overpowering honest nodes or making secondary exploits easier, like stealing private keys.

NordLayer's thorough look at blockchain security finds a number of weaknesses that crypto viruses take advantage of or make worse:

Phishing tactics that deceive people into giving away their private keys are a common way for worms to get in. Once they get the wallets, attackers empty them or add worm code to spread it further.

Attackers can get close to controlling most of the hashing power in proof-of-work systems by compromising numerous nodes through worm propagation. NordLayer discusses the 2020 Ethereum Classic attacks, when three separate 51% attacks allowed people to spend the same money twice, costing millions.

Worms can generate phony identities (Sybil) or intercept communications (routing) to cut off nodes, obtain IP addresses, or stop transactions.

Flawed smart contract programming, like the Poly Network hack in 2021 that stole more than $600 million, makes it possible for hackers to get in. Worms can gain a foothold on devices that store keys due to endpoint flaws.

Worms that are in between users and blockchain nodes can change transactions while they are being sent. These concerns show how crypto worms shift the blockchain's strengths from decentralization to attack surfaces spread across the network.

Crypto worms suck up a lot of resources, which can raise your electricity bill, slow down your devices, and even damage your hardware if the CPU is overused. In businesses or mining, they lead to significant cloud computing costs and issues with the blockchain. They aren't as devastating as ransomware right away, but they can persist for a long time without being detected. 

The number of attacks is rising as the value of cryptocurrencies increases. NordLayer analysts say that bad node verification and weak encryption make these kinds of threats possible. CrowdStrike says that worm operators are increasingly using privacy coins like Monero because they can't be traced back to their transactions.

Good protection includes both technological controls and user awareness. NordLayer recommends using strong encryption (AES-256), multi-signature wallets, regular code audits, and, when possible, moving to proof-of-stake to make 51% attacks more expensive. Bug bounties and penetration testing are two examples of secure development approaches that fix problems with smart contracts.

CrowdStrike recommends avoiding URLs you didn't request, using HTTPS, enabling multi-factor authentication, and setting up advanced endpoint detection with anomaly monitoring for suspicious CPU spikes. 

Zero Trust architectures, network segmentation, and employee training simulators are all good for businesses. Regular patching, using a VPN, and using monitoring tools designed for blockchain also help stop worms from spreading.

 What exactly is a crypto worm? A crypto worm is a self-replicating form of crypto-malware that spreads autonomously across devices and networks, installing cryptojacking scripts that secretly mine cryptocurrency using the victim's resources without their knowledge.

 How does a crypto worm differ from regular crypto-malware? While both enable cryptojacking, crypto worms add autonomous self-propagation by exploiting network vulnerabilities, allowing a single infection to spread rapidly, unlike non-replicating crypto-malware, which requires repeated manual delivery.

 Can crypto worms affect blockchain networks directly? Yes, by compromising multiple nodes or endpoints, they can contribute to Sybil attacks, facilitate 51% control, or enable private key theft, undermining consensus and transaction integrity.

 What are the main signs of a crypto worm infection? Unexplained high CPU or GPU usage, slowed device performance, increased electricity consumption, and difficulty multitasking often indicate a crypto worm running in the background.

 How can individuals and organizations protect against crypto worms? Use multi-factor authentication, avoid suspicious links, keep systems patched, deploy endpoint detection tools, conduct smart contract audits, and apply Zero Trust security principles to limit spread and resource hijacking.

Around the time Rob Hadick signed the paperwork to join Dragonfly Capital in April 2022, he rented a house in the Hamptons. A contract with his former employer, hedge fund GoldenTree, obliged him to refrain from working for six months, so Hadick prepared to lean into forced leisure time in the country. His plans for a relaxed stay soon came undone.

Shortly after his arrival, the crypto market went into free fall following the implosion of a notorious stablecoin project called Terra Luna. Hadick remembers scrolling through Twitter as the contagion spread. His wife called to ask if he was relaxing. “I don't think you understand what's happening to our net worth,” he responded. “I am drinking whiskey in a dark room at 2 p.m. on a Tuesday.” 

His exile finally ended in November—just in time for a second crypto calamity in the form of FTX's collapse. But Hadick never rethought his decision to go all in on crypto. “I was scared about what was happening to the industry,” he recently told Fortune from Dragonfly's offices near New York City's Union Square. “But I was excited about the opportunity we had, because we [still] had $500 million to deploy.” 

That fund, Dragonfly's third, ended up catapulting the firm into the upper echelon of the crypto venture world, competing with the likes of Andreessen Horowitz and Paradigm thanks to its prescient bets on now massive startups including Polymarket, Rain, and Ethena. Now, as crypto enters yet another winter, with token prices plummeting and excitement washed out by AI hype, Dragonfly is announcing its fourth fund, a $650 million vehicle. 

The crypto venture ecosystem is going through a “mass extinction event,” as Hadick put it, but Dragonfly has thrived despite a founder breakup, a regulatory scare from the Department of Justice, and a pivot away from China amid a crypto crackdown. At the core of Dragonfly's strategy are its four symbiotic leaders: Hadick, the fintech bridge; Haseeb Qureshi, the ambassador; Tom Schmidt, the DeFi whiz; and Bo Feng, the firm's mysterious founder and an icon of the Chinese tech scene. “It's bizarre to see us now become one of the incumbents,” said Qureshi. “We're playing a bigger game than we were playing in the past.” 

Qureshi started playing poker professionally at 16 years old, mostly sticking to online games because he wasn't allowed in casinos. By the time he was 21, Qureshi had raked in almost $2 million, but he realized that he didn't want to make the game his life. He made a bet with a friend that if he ever played another hand of professional poker, Qureshi would have to pay him $100,000. “That was my way of sealing off the decision for myself,” he told Fortune.

Qureshi says that his early years at the digital card table prepared him for a pivot into crypto investing. Just as friends told him he was crazy for becoming a teenage poker shark, his decision to join the crypto industry elicited widespread doubt, not least because Qureshi had made a name for himself as a Silicon Valley software engineer. He left a lucrative job at Airbnb to go start a stablecoin startup in 2017, long before stablecoins were all the rage, eventually finding his way to a (then) $500 million venture fund called MetaStable. 

Today, Qureshi is arguably the public face of Dragonfly, thanks to his role on the popular Chopping Block podcast—the crypto version of All-In—and viral posts on Crypto Twitter about the failure of Web3 gaming or the efficacy of blockchain launches. But Qureshi didn't start at Dragonfly until a few months after it began, joining in 2019 as the crypto industry was stuck in one of its regular prolonged downturns.  

That early Dragonfly is unrecognizable from its current form. The firm began as a partnership between Alex Pack, a young VC leading crypto deals at Bain Capital Ventures, and Bo Feng, who had made a name as one of the top investors in China's burgeoning internet ecosystem. Feng, who declined to be interviewed for this story, is reported to have connections to China's political elite, forged in part by his marriage to a granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, who came to power after Mao Zedong's death. 

Through his firm Ceyuan Ventures, Feng had invested in the crypto exchange OKEx (later rebranded to OKX), which in 2018 was the largest exchange in the world. He joined forces with Pack to make bets both in the U.S. and Asia. According to an early article in Bitcoin Magazine, Dragonfly's first $100 million fund was backed by some of the largest names in Asian tech, including Sequoia China's Neil Shen. (Beyond Feng's role as a bridge to the region's financial powerhouses, Qureshi described him as a “relationship savant,” though he keeps a low public profile.)

Dragonfly built its reputation with investments into crypto companies like the exchange Bybit and the financial services firm Matrixport, as well as investing into other crypto venture firms as a fund of funds. According to Qureshi, when he came onboard, he presented three conditions: He wanted to stop doing fund investments, he wanted to lead more deals, and he wanted to build out a technical team. “Bo basically said yes to all three,” Qureshi said. “In his words, he threw the car keys to me…and that was the birth of modern Dragonfly.” One of Qureshi's first moves was to bring on Schmidt, then the head of product at a decentralized exchange called 0x, as a junior investor. (Schmidt quickly rose the ranks to general partner.) 

The split between Pack, who went on to start his own venture firm Hack VC, and Dragonfly is the stuff of crypto VC lore, though Qureshi downplays the drama. “It ultimately led to us just having totally different visions for what fund two and beyond was supposed to look like for Dragonfly,” he said. Pack told Fortune that his first fund with Feng was a “tremendous success,” but realized they were “very different culturally.” 

“I spent a few months helping to hire and train my replacements, and then we parted ways,” he said. Schmidt used more colorful language to describe Pack, attributing the schism to personality.

By 2020, when Pack left the firm, Dragonfly had bigger problems. In large part due to Feng, the firm had its back office team in Beijing. But the Chinese government had begun to crack down on crypto, forcing Dragonfly to pick up its Asia operations and move to Singapore. According to Schmidt, who speaks Chinese and had chosen to intern at a Chinese company during college instead of accepting an early offer from Coinbase, Dragonfly still maintains a strong Asia presence, though its investments in the region have gone down over the years. “You look at the user base of a lot of these chains and [decentralized exchanges], and they're obviously very Asia-based,” he told Fortune, “But in terms of new investment opportunities, there haven't been as many as there used to be.” 

Still, the firm's presence in the U.S. crypto scene grew. There were bigger players raising monster funds, including Paradigm and Haun Ventures, which each had vehicles over $1 billion, compared to Dragonfly's comparatively modest second fund of $225 million closed in late 2020. Still, Dragonfly backed winners such as the layer-1 blockchain Avalanche and the financial services firm Amber Group, as well as an investment into the controversial privacy protocol Tornado Cash, which allows users to anonymize crypto transactions. The latter landed Dragonfly in national headlines in 2025 after prosecutors let slip that Schmidt might face criminal charges for the investment as part of a broader money laundering case. (The Department of Justice quickly backtracked, earning the firm a badge of honor among crypto true believers, though Qureshi said the investment was never ideological.) 

Hadick's arrival amid the existential collapse of FTX, however, catapulted Dragonfly to the next echelon—and solidified the firm's identity.  

During the crypto boom of 2021, entrepreneurs put forth lofty schemes to remake the internet with decentralized plumbing. Those included building would-be alternatives to the likes of Twitter and Spotify. For crypto investors, these plans revolved around so-called token mechanisms, with venture firms receiving rights to own proprietary cryptocurrencies in lieu of traditional equity stakes.

That Web3 vision of the future never fully played out. Even before the collapse of FTX, crypto was headed in one direction: Wall Street. Bitcoin had started out as a form of electronic cash, and then Ethereum built the next layer by allowing developers to code decentralized financial applications for lending and trading. But investors like Hadick, who came from the world of traditional finance, believed that crypto would soon swallow all of the functions of banks and brokerage firms. “We knew that that was the one place where we needed somebody who was deeper than we were,” Qureshi said. “Rob was just the person that we all intellectually felt had the horsepower, the coverage and the experience to play that role.”

When Hadick joined, Dragonfly began to make investments into the kinds of companies that now define the crypto landscape. One, Ethena, was building a synthetic dollar that generated yield through a complicated hedge fund-like strategy on the back end. Though Ethena has since become one of the most prominent projects in the crowded field of stablecoins, when founder Guy Young pitched the idea to investors, most of them dismissed the idea as “insane,” as he put it. The skeptics cited the Terra Luna debacle, which nearly took down the entire crypto industry after the algorithmic-backed stablecoin failed to maintain a $1 peg. “It's actually offensive that you're even saying this after what just happened,” Young remembered investors telling him. 

This was still the middle of the bear market of 2023, and Dragonfly jumped at the opportunity. “They were able to look at it from first principles,” Young said. The firm led Ethena's $6 million seed round. Just over a year ago, Ethena raised a $100 million round, with investors including Franklin Templeton and Fidelity's venture arm. Today, its flagship stablecoin has a market capitalization of around $6.3 billion. 

The next year, Dragonfly backed the Series B funding round for Polymarket, which the firm had almost invested in years before. According to Qureshi, Dragonfly was nearly the first investor into Polymarket's seed round back in 2020, when Shayne Coplan was striking out with most of the VCs he was pitching. “We really loved him,” Qureshi said, even though prediction markets hadn't yet proven successful at the time. Polychain ended up offering a better term sheet, which Dragonfly decided not to match. “It was obviously a massive miss on our part, but we had the right idea,” Qureshi said. 

The rest of the crypto industry eventually came onboard with the idea that the most successful digital asset companies wouldn't be blockchain-based mobile games, but relatively boring versions of financial products like credit cards and money market funds. Even Chris Dixon, the a16z partner who championed the Web3 principles of “read write own,” recently wrote a post on X arguing that we are now in the “financial era of blockchains.” 

“This is the biggest meta shift I can feel in my entire time in the industry,” Schmidt said, adding that investors are realizing there will be fewer native tokens for different crypto protocols, and more tokens that represent a real world asset like stocks and private credit funds. “A lot of crypto funds are now saying, ‘Hey, we're fintech funds,'” Hadick said. “Which is what I think we do better than anybody.”  

The increasing integration of blockchain and the finance industry raises uncomfortable questions of whether crypto is betraying its founding ideals, which saw Bitcoin as a rebellion against the big bank and government control of the financial system. 

“I do always try not to lose sight of the bigger picture, which is we made this digital internet money [go] from zero to a trillion dollars in 10 years,” said Schmidt. “The job is obviously not done, and if anything when I look globally, I think that the need for this stuff is more in demand than ever.” 

Nearly four years after Hadick joined, the crypto venture sector is stuck in another identity crisis, with deals falling and funds struggling to convince backers to refill their coffers. But with its fresh war chest, Dragonfly is ready to shape the next blockchain era. “We talk out loud and we say what we think,” said Qureshi. “In a space that is just completely flooded with bullshit and with fakers and self-promoters, I think that has actually been a superpower.”

NFT (NYSE: MI) launched an asset-backed, transaction-driven supply chain finance service for U.S. renewable-energy projects, announced Feb 17, 2026. The program is described as valued at USD 500 million and targets gigawatt-scale solar, manufacturing, EPC and BESS deployments.

On Jan 25, 2026, Takung Exchange Ltd signed a Supply Chain Financing Framework Agreement with Solarlink Group that could support procurement of up to 1.2 GW/year of solar module components at an estimated $0.15 per watt. Revenue is expected from interest income, service fees, and data service fees; specific drawdowns and schedules will be set in supplemental financing schedules.


      
      
      Following this news, MI has declined 21.43%, reflecting a significant negative market reaction.

      Our momentum scanner has triggered 15 alerts so far, indicating notable trading interest and price volatility.
      
      
      The stock is currently trading at $4.40.
      
      
      This price movement has removed approximately $17M from the company's valuation.
      
      
      Trading volume is exceptionally heavy at 5.5x the average, suggesting significant selling pressure.

MI was up 2.75% with sector momentum flagged: peers like WBUY and JFBR moved up 6.88% and 4.65%, while JWEL declined 29.91%. Broader Consumer Cyclical names showed mixed but generally positive bias, so today's gain reflects both company news and sector dynamics.

An amended shelf registration on Form F-3/A was filed on 2025-07-14 and remains active, with no recorded usage so far and not yet effective per the provided data. This indicates potential capacity for future registered offerings, but no specific dollar amount or utilization details are available from the current context.


      The stock is dropping -21.4% following this news. A negative reaction despite expansion news would fit a narrative where investors remained focused on prior dilution and overhang risks. The company previously registered 9,253,262 resale shares tied to $20 million in convertible notes and maintains an active F-3/A shelf with no recorded usage. The new USD 500 million supply chain finance initiative and 1.2 GW procurement framework might have been viewed as strategically interesting but not yet de-risked.

Logan Paul, Justin Bieber, Neymar, Madonna and others sit on deep NFT losses as the 2021 celebrity hype cycle gives way to a utility-focused market reset.

Multiple celebrities who purchased non-fungible tokens during the 2021 market peak have experienced substantial losses as NFT valuations declined, according to public blockchain data and marketplace estimates.

Logan Paul purchased a 0N1 Force NFT that has since declined sharply in value, according to blockchain records. Justin Bieber acquired Bored Ape #3001, now estimated to be worth significantly less than its purchase price. Soccer player Neymar bought two Bored Ape NFTs whose combined value has fallen substantially from original acquisition costs.

Madonna purchased a Bored Ape NFT now valued at a fraction of its purchase price, while basketball player Stephen Curry bought a Bored Ape currently trading at lower valuations, according to marketplace data. Rapper Eminem acquired a Bored Ape that has similarly declined in value. Television host Jimmy Fallon purchased a Bored Ape now valued below its peak price.

NFT prices surged in 2021 amid celebrity endorsements and increased speculative demand, according to market analysts. Floor prices across major collections reached elevated valuations during the period. As cryptocurrency market liquidity tightened in 2022 and 2023, NFT markets experienced a prolonged contraction, with many collections losing substantial portions of their peak value.

Bored Ape Yacht Club, previously considered a leading NFT collection, saw floor prices fall from peak levels to lower ranges in subsequent market cycles, according to marketplace tracking data.

Celebrity purchases during the 2021 period occurred near market peaks, reflecting late-cycle momentum, according to blockchain transaction records. The price declines follow patterns observed in previous speculative market cycles.

Despite the decline in collectible NFT pricing, activity continues in gaming assets, digital identity, ticketing and brand engagement applications, according to industry reports. The market has shifted from luxury collectible pricing toward utility-driven models, analysts stated.

The 2021 NFT market cycle followed a pattern of cultural adoption, celebrity participation, speculative activity and subsequent price decline, according to market observers. Digital ownership concepts continue to develop in gaming, media and tokenized identity applications, industry participants reported.

While Bitcoin (BTC) attempted to climb back above $70,000 and Ethereum (ETH) slipped below $2,000 again, cryptocurrency news was buzzing about WWE wrestler Logan Paul's sale of a Pokémon collectible card for a record $16.5 million, which was once listed as a non-fungible token (NFT). 

One-half of the sibling celebrity duo, Logan Paul, once offered to sell fractionalized ownership of the rare Pikachu Pokémon card on the now-defunct Liquid Marketplace in 2022, prior to the website getting shut down. This drew ire from users online, calling out the YouTuber for running a scam – and it is not the first time.

Delphi Labs general counsel Gabriel Shapiro said on X, the Logan Paul Pikachu NFT fractionalization fiasco is a classic case of ""slop tokenization"", the token is basically just 'juxtaposed' with property but has no rights to it

In a post on X, Paul explained that he had originally sought to sell a 51% stake in the card on the NFT platform, but only 5.4% of the card was bought. The sales added up to around $270,000, he wrote. He then bought the card back in May 2024 for the same price.

Shortly thereafter, Liquid Marketplace went offline, and users could no longer withdraw their funds. Paul said he personally paid to get the site back up and that users can withdraw their funds at any time.

He has not been as patient when it comes to his other NFTs. X news aggregator WatcherGuru was reportedly blocked by the WWE wrestler after the channel pointed out that Paul purchased an Azuki NFT for $623,000 in 2021, and now its value is down to just $155.

Overall, the NFT market capitalization has fallen by more than 26% over the past year and remains more than $210 billion below its 2021 peak.

Bitcoin's price was trying to hold above $68,000 on Tuesday morning, down 1.4% in the last 23 hours. On Stockwits, retail sentiment around the apex cryptocurrency trended in ‘bearish' territory amid ‘low' levels of chatter.Ethereum's price slid to $1.971, down 0.9% in the last 24 hours, with retail sentiment also trending in the ‘bearish' zone, accompanied by ‘low' levels of chatter. The overall cryptocurrency market cap was down 1% to $2.4 trillion, with liquidations totaling around $220 million, according to CoinGlass data.

Organisations offering online services likely to be accessed by
children in the UK must meet clear duties aimed at protecting
minors online. The ICO's Children's Code
(Age Appropriate Design
Code) translates these duties into practical ""design
principles and privacy features"" (for more information
see our article here). A key requirement under the
Children's Code is appropriate age assurance i.e. tools and
approaches that estimate or verify a user's age so that
safeguards can be tailored or access restricted where necessary.
Alongside this, the Online Safety Act
2023 imposes a ""legal duty to protect children
online"" such as ""using effective age
assurance"" methods. Together, these approaches place the
child's best interests at the forefront of online services.

The ICO's probe into Imgur

Against this regulatory backdrop, the ICO launched a review on 3 March
2025 into how social media and video sharing platforms were using
children's personal data. As part of this, the ICO examined
Imgur, an image sharing and hosting platform owned by MediaLab.AI
Inc (MediaLab). The review identified several concerns with
Imgur's approach to age verification.

By 10 September 2025, the ICO had issued MediaLab with a notice of intent to
impose a penalty. Shortly after, on 30 September 2025, Imgur blocked UK access to
its platform. The ICO described this as a ""commercial
decision"" by MediaLab, although the timing clearly
reflected the seriousness of the regulator's findings. On 5
February 2026, the ICO confirmed that MediaLab had failed to
protect children's personal data between September 2021 and
September 2025 and imposed a fine of
£247,590.

Despite Imgur's own terms and conditions stating that
children under 13 years could only use the platform with parental
supervision, MediaLab had no safeguards in place to determine a
user's age or to obtain parental consent when accessing Imgur.
Specifically, the ICO found that MediaLab had:

In practice, the absence of age assurance meant that children
using the site were at risk of encountering harmful content
including material related to ""eating disorders,
homophobia, antisemitism and images of a sexual or violent
nature"".

When determining the penalty, the ICO considered the number of
children affected, the degree of harm, the duration of the breach,
and MediaLab's global turnover. The regulator also acknowledged
MediaLab's cooperation and commitments to address its
compliance gaps, but noted that failure to implement the necessary
measures could lead to further regulatory action.

The timing and outcome of the investigation naturally give rise
to further reflections. The breaches date back to 2021, yet
meaningful enforcement action has only materialised now, more than
a year after the ICO began its investigation. The relatively modest
level of the fine, particularly when set against the global scale
of Imgur and its millions of users, may raise eyebrows.
MediaLab's cooperation will undoubtedly have influenced the
final figure, but whether the company will appeal the penalty
remains to be seen.

Key takeaways

With age assurance becoming increasingly central to digital
regulation, particularly in light of the government's recent consultation
exploring a ban on social media use by children following
Australia's approach, scrutiny of online platforms is only
likely to increase. This is especially true given the ICO's
strengthened governance and enforcement powers under the Data (Use and Access)
Act 2025. Even where financial penalties appear modest, the
reputational and operational consequences for online services can
be significant. This latest decision serves as a clear reminder
that compliance cannot be an afterthought.

German central bank president Joachim Nagel said he sees “merit in euro-denominated stablecoins,” and argues that they could serve as a cheaper and more efficient means for cross-border payments by both firms and individuals.

During his speech at the New Year's Reception of the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany in Frankfurt, Nagel, who leads the Deutsche Bundesbank, added that the EU is “working hard on the introduction of the digital euro.”

“This will be the first pan-European retail digital payment solution, based solely on European infrastructures,” he added.

However, he did not elaborate on how euro-denominated stablecoins would be regulated within the European Union's existing legal framework, nor clarify how they would interact with the planned digital euro or broader monetary policy architecture.

In separate comments made last week, Nagel cautioned that if US dollar-denominated stablecoins were to gain significantly larger market share than a euro-pegged alternative, European monetary policy “could be severely impaired,” and the continent's sovereignty could be weakened.

Nagel, who has long maintained a cautious and skeptical stance toward unbacked cryptocurrencies, has instead advocated the use of a state-backed digital euro, which he believes “will play a role in future resilience” for Europe.

According to him, the central bank has already “accomplished important exploratory work on the possible introduction of a wholesale CBDC.” A wholesale CBDC, he said, would allow financial institutions to make “programmable payments” in central bank money.

Elsewhere in the U.S., there has been a lot of momentum around stablecoin, and the market has been expanding at a rapid pace on the back of demand for dollar-equivalent settlement layers, especially after President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law in July 2025.

But policy deadlock around a key market structure bill has stalled progress and divided crypto industry and banking stakeholders over issues such as stablecoin yield and reward mechanisms.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","Bundesbank Backs Euro CBDC, Stablecoins Push","https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2026/02/17/bundesbank-backs-euro-cbdc-stablecoins-push/","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 06:48:00 GMT","

At a New Year's Reception in Frankfurt on Monday, Joachim Nagel, president of the Deutsche Bundesbank, backed a euro-pegged central bank digital currency and euro-denominated stablecoins for payments. He said European Union officials were working toward launching a retail central bank digital currency. He argued that euro stablecoins could strengthen Europe's independence in payment systems.

The ECB news arrived as policymakers weighed the competitive pressure from U.S. digital asset regulation. European officials have debated how to prevent dollar-backed stablecoins from dominating cross-border payments. In that context, the euro central bank digital currency became a strategic policy tool rather than a technical upgrade.

President Donald Trump had signed legislation establishing a framework for payment stablecoins in the United States. The law set a path for regulated dollar-pegged tokens and outlined a phased implementation timeline tied to final rulemaking. That shift occurred because Washington sought to formalize oversight of digital payment instruments before private issuers expanded further.

Nagel's Frankfurt remarks followed those developments and addressed the competitive balance between currencies. He said a wholesale central bank digital currency would allow financial institutions to execute programmable payments in central bank money. He also stated that euro-denominated stablecoins could enable cross-border transfers for individuals and firms at low cost. The ECB news, therefore, framed stablecoins as a complement to public money, not a replacement for it.

At a recent Euro50 Group meeting, Nagel had warned that domestic monetary policy could be impaired if dollar stablecoins captured a dominant market share. He said European sovereignty could weaken if a foreign-pegged digital currency became the primary settlement layer for cross-border activity. That warning placed the euro central bank digital currency within a broader monetary strategy.

The Bundesbank chief did not repeat those risks during the Frankfurt event, yet the earlier statement shaped the interpretation of his support. By endorsing euro-denominated stablecoins alongside a retail central bank digital currency, he signaled a dual-track approach. One track relies on central bank issuance. The other allows private issuers to operate within a euro framework.

In Washington, lawmakers continued discussing the CLARITY Act in the Senate. Meetings between White House officials, banking representatives, and crypto industry executives focused on unresolved provisions tied to stablecoin rewards. That debate reflected tension between traditional banks and digital asset firms over how to distribute yield.

The U.S. bill aimed to provide a comprehensive regulatory structure for digital assets, yet stablecoin incentives remained unsettled. That uncertainty contrasted with Nagel's narrower remarks in Frankfurt, which focused on payment utility and sovereignty rather than yield mechanics. As a result, ECB news centered on payment architecture while U.S. discussions revolved around competitive incentives.

Nagel distinguished between retail and wholesale central bank digital currencies. A retail version would target consumers and businesses for everyday transactions. A wholesale version would operate between financial institutions for programmable settlement. That separation clarified the Bundesbank's technical direction without committing to immediate rollout.

The ECB news, therefore, presented the development of the euro digital currency as gradual and policy-driven. Officials framed the project as part of Europe's effort to retain control over settlement infrastructure. The emphasis on cross-border payments suggested that global trade and remittances remain key drivers of digital currency strategy.

Policy debates over central bank digital currency adoption often hinge on privacy, financial stability, and competitive positioning. Nagel's comments concentrated on independence and cost efficiency. He avoided providing detailed timelines or issuance volumes, indicating that implementation remains under review.

The next ECB news milestone will likely center on formal legislative proposals within the European Union. Market participants will monitor whether euro-denominated stablecoins receive explicit regulatory pathways aligned with central bank oversight. Policymakers now face a strategic choice: accelerate digital euro plans or allow private euro tokens to scale first.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","Germany's Central Bank President Endorses Euro-Denominated Stablecoins and CBDCs for EU","https://www.kucoin.com/news/flash/germany-s-central-bank-president-endorses-euro-denominated-stablecoins-and-cbdcs-for-eu","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 00:48:57 GMT","

The head of Germany's central bank signaled a deliberate shift in Europe's approach to digital money, endorsing euro-denominated instruments as a path to greater autonomy in payments. Joachim Nagel, president of the Deutsche Bundesbank, used remarks at the New Year's Reception of the American Chamber of Commerce in Frankfurt to outline support for both a euro-denominated central bank digital currency (CBDC) and euro-stablecoins for everyday transactions. He noted that EU officials are actively pursuing a retail CBDC and argued that stablecoins pegged to the euro could help Europe “become more independent in terms of payment systems and solutions.” The comments underscore a broader, ongoing debate about how Europe should compete with dollar-based rails in a rapidly evolving digital money landscape.

Market context: The dialogue arrives as Washington accelerates work on a broader regulatory framework for digital assets, including stablecoins, with White House discussions and Senate consideration surrounding the CLARITY Act. The GENIUS Act, referenced in policy discussions, would shape how payment-focused stablecoins are governed in the United States, potentially influencing cross-border competition and global liquidity channels.

At the core of Nagel's remarks is a recognition that Europe cannot rely solely on US-dominated payment rails if it wants to preserve sovereignty over its monetary infrastructure. The Bundesbank chief's emphasis on euro-denominated stablecoins points to a belief that European coins could complement, rather than replace, traditional fiat money by enabling near-instant cross-border transactions at a lower cost. In practical terms, euro-stablecoins could streamline settlement for trade, remittances, and business-to-business payments across the single market and beyond, potentially reducing frictions tied to currency conversion and correspondent banking networks.

Yet the path forward is not without risk. Nagel highlighted that a wholesale CBDC could unlock programmable payments in central bank money, a feature that could transform how financial institutions manage liquidity, settlement risk, and monetary policy transmission. Still, he warned that if USD-denominated stablecoins were to gain outsized market share, European monetary sovereignty could be compromised. Those tensions mirror broader global debates about who controls the rails for a digital, borderless payments landscape and how to balance innovation with financial stability.

The remarks come amid broader regulatory activity in the United States. Lawmakers and White House officials have been meeting with banking and crypto industry representatives ahead of potential votes on legislation such as the CLARITY Act, which seeks to establish a comprehensive framework for digital assets. The GENIUS Act, referenced in various policy discussions, would establish a structured approach to stablecoins and their use in everyday payments. The legislative process is ongoing, with timelines cited for implementation once enacted or once related regulations are finalized. These developments signal a convergence of policy considerations in the United States and Europe as both blocs weigh how best to foster innovation while protecting financial stability.

Against this regulatory backdrop, European institutions have continued to explore practical pilots and market offerings that could align with a euro-centric digital money strategy. The intersection of central bank digital currency planning and private sector stablecoins could yield a spectrum of options for users—from instant, low-cost cross-border transfers to programmable payments anchored in central bank money. The evolution of these ideas will likely depend on how policymakers assess risk, privacy, interoperability, and compatibility with existing monetary policy frameworks.

Europe is rapidly outlining a digital money strategy that blends central bank-issued digital currencies with privately issued, euro-pegged stablecoins. Nagel's remarks reflect a strategic shift: rather than purely adapting existing fiat rails, Europe appears to be exploring digital instruments designed to operate alongside traditional money while offering new capabilities for payments and settlement. The emphasis on euro-denominated stablecoins as a vehicle for cross-border transactions aligns with a broader push to reduce frictions in regional commerce and to avoid overreliance on dollar-based settlement networks. By framing these instruments as potential levers for European sovereignty, Nagel signals that digital money policy is moving from abstract theory to concrete policy design and market testing.

The discussion also underscores the complexity of implementing these tools in a way that preserves financial stability and consumer protections. A wholesale CBDC, with its programmable-money feature set, could enable central banks to automate and tailor payments at scale. Yet such capabilities raise questions about privacy, data governance, and the potential impact on bank balance sheets as settlement rails evolve. While euro-stablecoins could offer efficiency gains for cross-border flows and domestic payments, policymakers will need to weigh currency sovereignty against integration with global markets, ensuring interoperability with existing payment ecosystems and compliance with anti-money-laundering standards.

On the policy front, the United States is actively shaping its own framework for digital assets, and lawmakers have signaled a willingness to adopt a comprehensive regime. The GENIUS Act and related measures aim to provide a clear regulatory pathway, while ongoing White House discussions with financial institutions and crypto firms illustrate the complexity of balancing innovation with risk controls. The timing of these regulatory moves is critical, given the speed at which digital payment technologies are evolving and the possibility that stablecoins could become a dominant cross-border supplier of liquidity if left unregulated or underregulated. In Europe, the path forward will be shaped by the European Central Bank's decisions, national implementations, and the region's ability to coordinate with international standards to ensure compatibility and resilience across the payment ecosystem.

Ultimately, Nagel's comments framing euro-denominated tools as a means to strengthen European autonomy in payments reflect a broader trend: governments are increasingly looking to digital money not merely as a fintech curiosity but as a strategic pillar of monetary sovereignty, financial stability, and competitive positioning in a rapidly digitizing global economy.

 Take a 30-second survey to help improve The Block. 

Stablecoins are shifting from a crypto trading tool to an everyday financial instrument, with users allocating a growing share of their savings and income to dollar-pegged tokens, according to a new global study from BVNK conducted in partnership with Coinbase and Artemis.

Findings from The Stablecoin Utility Report 2026, based on a YouGov survey of 4,658 adults across 15 countries, posits that more than $300 billion in stablecoin market capitalization is increasingly used for payments, payroll, and savings alongside trading activity.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged 1:1 to fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar and backed by reserves or other collateral. These dollar-tied tokens have a circulating supply of around $300 billion, led by Tether's (USDT) and Circle's (USDC), according to The Block's data dashboard.



More than half of respondents said they have held stablecoins in the past 12 months, and 56% intend to acquire more over the next year. Among non-owners, 13% plan to start. Momentum also appears on the rise as half of the current holders increased their balances over the past year.

Stablecoins are capturing a more meaningful slice of personal balance sheets, too. On average, holders said they allocate roughly one-third of their total savings to crypto and stablecoins combined. Moreover, people in places with more volatile local currencies or less reliable cross-border payment services are more incentivized to use stablecoins. The mean allocation was higher in low- and middle-income economies than in high-income markets, according to the study.

Ownership rates in the survey were also higher in low- and middle-income economies than in high-income ones, with Africa leading. Indeed, the region recorded the strongest forward intent to acquire more stablecoins. The data echoes a report from Standard Chartered, which estimated that as much as $1 trillion could ultimately migrate out of emerging market bank deposits into U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins.

Spending behavior reinforces the idea that stablecoins are circulating rather than sitting idle. Among holders, 27% said they spend directly on goods and services, while 45% convert to local currency. More than a quarter convert or spend within days, and roughly two-thirds do so within a few months.

Demand for merchant acceptance appears to be outpacing supply. 52%t of holders said they have made a purchase specifically because a business accepted stablecoins. At the same time, desired spending exceeds current spending across every major category surveyed, including everyday purchases and large lifestyle expenses.

For cross-border workers, stablecoins are not marginal. Among freelancers, gig workers, and marketplace sellers who receive payments in stablecoins, the tokens account for about 35% of annual earnings on average. Nearly three-quarters said stablecoins have improved their ability to work with international clients, and three-quarters of marketplace sellers reported higher sales volumes or expanded customer bases.

Cost savings are a key driver. Respondents who receive payments or remittances in crypto, including stablecoins, reported saving an average of 40% in fees compared with traditional payment and remittance services. Lower transaction fees, better security, and the ability to transact internationally ranked as the top motivations for using stablecoins over other methods.

Still, the report highlights friction points that still kneecap the next phase of adoption.

The most common frustrations include irreversible payments and risk of losing funds, too many steps to complete transactions, and confusion around blockchain selection and wallet management.

Users said they want stablecoin payments to mirror mainstream payment systems, with universal acceptance, clear fees, and stronger consumer protections.

If that connective layer materializes, stablecoins may increasingly function less like crypto assets and more like digital cash — programmable, borderless, and, for a growing cohort of users, simply money.

The findings arrive as regulatory clarity expands in several markets, especially in the United States under President Donald Trump's administration.

After signing the GENIUS ACT into law, policymakers are negotiating a final federal framework for the crypto market that includes dollar-backed tokens. Disagreements around stablecoin yields abound, with industry sources saying the ""clock is ticking"" to get rules over the line before the midterm elections.

As crypto adoption continues to strengthen, stablecoins are moving to the forefront, with their use cases expanding across everyday financial activity. According to a new global survey by financial infrastructure provider BVNK, a growing share of workers receive salaries, pay bills, and make routine purchases using digital dollars.

The BVNK findings reflect broader trends in which crypto forms of fiat currencies, including stablecoins like USDT and USDC, which are pegged to the US dollar, are increasingly integrated into commercial and consumer products.

According to the BVNK survey, a good number of respondents reported using stablecoins for routine economic life. These use cases include receiving stablecoin-denominated paychecks as salaries, paying bills and monthly expenses with stable assets, and purchasing goods and services at merchants accepting digital currencies. 

The report suggests that stablecoins' appeal is due to a combination of low transaction costs, 24/7 settlement, and resistance to local currency depreciation. In countries with volatile exchange rates and weak currencies, workers and businesses increasingly see stablecoins as a way to preserve value and reduce friction in cross-border transactions.

In addition to payroll use cases, stablecoin adoption is growing for digital commerce and peer-to-peer transactions. Users from the survey cited ease of use on mobile wallets, near-instant settlement, and compatibility with global payment networks as key advantages over traditional bank transfers or remittance services.

While the prevalence of stablecoin usage varies globally, businesses operating in frontier and emerging markets have been early adopters of crypto-denominated payroll and payment systems. Some tech firms, freelancers, and remote workers now negotiate contracts and compensation in digital dollars, viewing them as a more flexible medium of exchange across borders.

Beyond individual usage, BVNK's data indicates that stablecoin payment volume tied to actual purchasing and spending is increasing faster than only trading activity on exchanges. This distinction underscores how stablecoins are beginning to play a role not just as trading instruments, but as money used in daily life.

Cross-border remittances, for example, have long been touted as a core use case for digital dollars, particularly in corridors with high migrant worker flows. Stablecoins allow senders to avoid high fees and slow settlement times characteristic of traditional remittance providers, especially when moving funds between emerging markets and developed economies.

Similarly, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) servicing international clients are increasingly offering stablecoin payment options to streamline billing and reduce foreign exchange risk. 

However, the BVNK report highlights that while stablecoins are gaining ground as digital money, confidence in the space hinges on transparency of reserves and issuer practices. Education and user experience are additional variables that could affect the pace of adoption. Many potential users still lack a basic understanding of wallet security, how blockchain works, and on-chain risk management. These could slow stablecoins' transition into broader commercial usage without supportive infrastructure and onboarding tools.

The number of IRS staff assigned to oversee anti-money laundering practices at the firms  dropped to its lowest level in nearly decade.

As cryptocurrency use in the United States surges, the number of federal investigators assigned to review safeguards against dirty money in the industry plummeted last year to the lowest level since at least 2017, according to federal data obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. 

The cuts weaken the anti-money laundering watchdog's office within the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which is tasked with overseeing protections against dirty money in crypto exchanges and other firms registered as so-called money service businesses. Even before the recent reductions, the IRS struggled to oversee dirty money in the fast-growing crypto sector, according to experts. The cuts come amid the Trump administration's broader easing of oversight of crypto exchanges that now move trillions of dollars in value annually. 

“The reduction in supervisory staff at the IRS matches a trend we've seen across [anti-money laundering] enforcement agencies,” said Erica Hanichak, deputy director at the FACT Coalition, a Washington-based nonprofit group that advocates for strong safeguards against illicit financial flows. “This sends the signal that the US is open to dirty money. It undermines our national security and market integrity.”

The IRS did not respond to requests for comment. 

Even as the industry has sought mainstream acceptance, cryptocurrency has played a key role in recent money laundering scandals.

Last November, ICIJ collaborated with 37 media partners in 35 countries to publish The Coin Laundry, an investigation into dirty money in the cryptocurrency industry. The investigation revealed that as recently as July 2025, Huione Group, a Cambodian financial institution flagged by US authorities in May as a “primary money laundering concern,” sent large sums of cryptocurrency to accounts at some of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance and OKX. These fund flows continued even after US authorities found major problems relating to the firms' anti-money laundering protocols.  

Cryptocurrency exchanges allow users to set up accounts to buy, trade and deposit cryptocurrency. They also offer a fast offramp for converting crypto assets into standard currency, a key goal of many crypto-reliant money launderers.

U.S. regulators classify crypto exchanges in the same category as so-called money services businesses (MSBs) like Western Union. Even before last year's cuts, the IRS office tasked with overseeing these businesses struggled to adequately supervise cryptocurrency operations, according to the agency's inspector general. 

In 2021, then-IRS commissioner Charles Rettig told Congress in a letter that the agency needed more staff to address the “rapidly evolving and expanding” cryptocurrency industry. That year, the IRS had 193 agents tasked with examining the anti-money laundering protocols of crypto exchanges and other MSBs, significantly more than in 2025, according to federal data.

“Conducting MSB examinations is an inherently laborious activity,” Rettig said in the letter. “[Examiners] need reinforcements to conduct more examinations of both traditional and digital asset MSBs, especially money transmitter principals. Increased funding for personnel and expenses, such as travel and analytical tools, is also necessary to supervise MSBs.” 

The following year, in 2022, Congress awarded the IRS tens of billions of dollars in additional funding, and the agency began rapidly expanding its ranks and embarked on a push to modernize its systems. But, early last year, the Trump administration's cost-cutting stopped this effort in its tracks, rapidly firing many of the new hires as Republicans in Congress also clawed back much of the new funds awarded to the agency. 

In April, the new administration also disbanded a Justice Department unit that investigated crypto-related crimes. In doing so, the department said it would still “pursue the illicit financing of these enterprises by the individuals and enterprises themselves, including when it involves digital assets, but will not pursue actions against the platforms that these enterprises utilize to conduct their illegal activities.” The Trump administration also quickly dropped enforcement actions against more than a dozen cryptocurrency firms, and the president pardoned several crypto executives who had pleaded guilty to violating anti-money laundering laws.

Cryptocurrency oversight is a very loosely knitted-together safety net.

— Alison Jimenez, an anti-money laundering expert

In 2025, the number of IRS investigators assigned to oversee the dirty money defenses of crypto firms and other money transmitters fell 33 percent to 139 agents, down from 208 in 2024. The falling numbers do not necessarily equate to layoffs, but rather the number of agents assigned to examine anti-money laundering practices in so-called nonbank financial institutions, which include cryptocurrency exchanges and other MSBs. The 2025 number is the lowest in the dataset, which dates back to 2017. ICIJ obtained the data through a public records request. Some U.S. states also supervise anti-money laundering practices at MSBs.  

Christina Rea, a compliance specialist who advises crypto firms on IRS anti-money laundering examinations, says the agency appears to be struggling to keep pace with overseeing dirty money safeguards in cryptocurrency. Rea says a small and dwindling group of IRS agents who possess deep virtual currency experience are tasked with overseeing a booming and highly complex new financial sector.

“What's notable is that this contraction appears to be happening while the regulated crypto and fintech ecosystem has grown dramatically in scale, transaction volume, product complexity and risk exposure,” Rea told ICIJ. “Compared to 2017 and 2018, today's firms are larger, more interconnected with traditional financial institutions, and operating far more sophisticated platforms, and yet examiner resources appear to have decreased rather than expanded.”

Alison Jimenez, an anti-money laundering expert, told ICIJ that, compared with the federal overseers of big banks, the IRS's lighter oversight of nonbank financial institutions results in action being taken rarely, even when agents unearth significant problems. 

“These are juggernaut financial institutions,” Jimenez said. “They are larger than a lot of banks but they are not getting the frequency of examinations or the in-depth examinations that banks get. If there are violations found, there is often no formal action taken.”

Jimenez said that fewer examiners overseeing crypto exchanges and other money transmitters could mean more problems with anti-money laundering safeguards will go undetected for longer and could eventually balloon into larger scandals that hurt consumers and damage the broader industry.

“Cryptocurrency oversight is a very loosely knitted-together safety net,” Jimenez said. “Now it's just getting pulled farther apart.”

Bitmine has 3,040,483 staked ETH, representing $6.1 billion at $1,998 per ETH; MAVAN staking solution on track to launch Q1 2026

Bitmine now owns 3.62% of the ETH token supply, over 72% of the way to the 'Alchemy of 5%' in just 7 months

Bitmine recently closed on initial $200 million investment into Beast Industries

Bitmine Crypto + Total Cash Holdings + ""Moonshots"" total $9.6 billion, including 4.371 million ETH tokens, total cash of $670 million, and other crypto holdings

Bitmine leads crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV per share and by the high trading liquidity of BMNR stock

Bitmine is the 158th most traded stock in the US, trading $0.9 billion per day (5-day avg)

Bitmine remains supported by a premier group of institutional investors including ARK's Cathie Wood, MOZAYYX, Founders Fund, Bill Miller III, Pantera, Kraken, DCG, Galaxy Digital and personal investor Thomas ""Tom"" Lee to support Bitmine's goal of acquiring 5% of ETH

LAS VEGAS, Feb. 17, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE AMERICAN: BMNR) Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (""Bitmine"" or the ""Company"") a Bitcoin and Ethereum Network company with a focus on the accumulation of crypto for long term investment, today announced Bitmine crypto + total cash + ""moonshots"" holdings totaling $9.6 billion.

As of February 16th, 2026 at 5:00pm ET, the Company's crypto holdings are comprised of 4,371,497 ETH at $1,998 per ETH (NASDAQ: COIN), 193 Bitcoin (BTC), $200 million stake in Beast Industries, $17 million stake in Eightco Holdings (NASDAQ: ORBS) (""moonshots"") and total cash of $670 million. Bitmine's ETH holdings are 3.62% of the ETH supply (of 120.7 million ETH).

""After spending the past week at Consensus Hong Kong, one of the largest global gatherings in crypto, we came away with a growing conviction that 2026 will be a defining year for Ethereum. We see strengthening product-market fit emerging on the back of three long-duration secular drivers: (i) Wall Street via tokenization/privacy on Ethereum; (ii) AI and AI-agents using Ethereum for both collecting payments as well as verification and (iii) creators leaning towards 'proof of human' and other standards running on Ethereum L2 (Worldchain, etc). There were many panel discussions and presentations around these 3 topics, and it is evident that Ethereum is well positioned to garner significant share, given its neutrality and 100% uptime and reliability,"" said Thomas ""Tom"" Lee, Chairman of Bitmine.

Mr. Lee's latest Chairman's message is his keynote given at Consensus HK, and he speaks about these 3 future growth drivers for ETH usage as well as the drivers for Bitmine growth initiatives. The link to his message is here.

""Investor sentiment and enthusiasm, by contrast, are rock bottom, reminding us of the forlornness and dejection seen at the November 2022 lows and depths of 2018 crypto winter. During 2018 and 2022, there were many high profile failures of large players (FTX, 3 arrows in 2022) while 2025-2026 has not seen such large-scale debacles. Rather, it seems like crypto has remained weak since the 'price shock' and massive deleveraging seen on October 10th. For us at Bitmine, we cannot control the price of Ethereum, and the company is acquiring ETH regardless of price trend, as the long-term outlook for Ethereum remains outstanding. Hence, we continue to buy ETH even as crypto moves through this 'mini-winter,'"" said Lee.

""In the past week, we acquired 45,759 ETH,"" continued Lee. ""Bitmine has been steadily buying Ethereum, as we view this pullback as attractive, given the strengthening fundamentals. In our view, the price of ETH is not reflective of the high utility of ETH and its role as the future of finance.""

As of February 16, 2026, Bitmine total staked ETH stands at 3,040,483 ($6.1 billion at $1,998 per ETH). ""Bitmine has staked more ETH than other entities in the world. At scale (when Bitmine's ETH is fully staked by MAVAN and its staking partners), the ETH staking rewards is $252 million annually (using 2.89% 7-day BMNR yield),"" stated Lee.

""Annualized staking revenues are now $176 million. And this 3.0 million ETH is about 69% of the 4.37 million ETH held by Bitmine. The CESR (Composite Ethereum Staking Rate, administered by Quatrefoil) is 2.84%, while Bitmine's own staking operations generated a 7-day yield of 2.89% (annualized). We continue to make progress on our staking solution known as The Made in America VAlidator Network (MAVAN). This will be the 'best-in-class' solution offering secure staking infrastructure and will be deployed in early calendar 2026. Bitmine is currently working with 3 staking providers as the Company moves towards unveiling MAVAN in 2026,"" continued Lee.

Bitmine crypto holding reigns as the #1 Ethereum treasury and #2 global treasury, behind Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR), which owns 714,644 BTC valued at $49 billion. Bitmine remains the largest ETH treasury in the world. 

Bitmine is one of the most widely traded stocks in the US. According to data from Fundstrat, the stock has traded average daily dollar volume of $0.9 billion (5-day average, as of February 13, 2026), ranking #158 in the US, behind KKR (rank #157) and ahead of CBRE (rank #159) among 5,704 US-listed stocks (statista.com and Fundstrat research).

The GENIUS Act and Securities and Exchange Commission's (""the SEC"") Project Crypto are as transformational to financial services in 2025 as US action on August 15, 1971 ending Bretton Woods and the USD on the gold standard 54 years ago. This 1971 event was the catalyst for the modernization of Wall Street, creating the iconic Wall Street titans and financial and payment rails of today. These proved to be better investments than gold.

I really like bitcoin's approach of not doing anything that seems much better to me… that's a much better use case for that as the store of value argument.

 — Mert Mumtaz

The programmable element of money doesn't make it money itself… we can think of it as value but it doesn't have to be money.

 — Mert Mumtaz

It's like saying you know why would you invest in robinhood when you've invested in gold it's like they're just completely different asset types with completely different theses on basically everything.

The thing to understand especially in crypto when it's newer technology is that you want to reduce you you you want to find pmf in a very small niche.

If I take that playground that let's say foundation then I can build structures on top of it that I know will stick because they obeyed the laws of physics and so that is to say all the problems that solana had in 2021 were soluble engineering problems.

Today solana does more transactions per second than most chains in crypto combined and it does that not only is it more scale it does it at a lower median fee.

I think we can become 10 x faster a 100 times cheaper and at least two times more usable for developers to then build applications for.

The ‘Ain Braq aqueduct, which runs through the Jabal al-Madhbah massif into Petra, was even more sophisticated than scientists previously believed.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The importance of finding water supplies in a harsh desert climate is a central theme in Frank Herbert's classic science-fiction novel Dune (and in its latest film adaptation by Denis Villeneuve). Rising from dusty sands and carved out of red sandstone, Jordan's ancient city of Petra is reminiscent of the desert landscapes and stone edifices of Herbert's faraway science-fiction desert planet. But Petra already had aqueducts and water systems thousands of years ago that were far ahead of any on fictional Arrakis—so no one in Petra ever needed a stillsuit to survive.

Petra was an urban hub of the ancient world despite its location in a semiarid climate that brought hardly any rain. It stood as the capital of the Nabatean kingdom until it became part of the Roman province of Arabia in the early 2nd century C.E. As an important administrative and trading center, Petra needed water for purposes beyond keeping its people alive. Its hydraulic systems filled baths, kept gardens and agriculture thriving, gushed from a sacred fountain known as a nymphaeum, and filled up basins in temples, sanctuaries, and tombs. Now, on the abandoned city's southeast edge, archaeologists have discovered that the ‘Ain Braq aqueduct running through the Jabal al-Madhbah massif into Petra was even more sophisticated than they previously believed. 

As part of a 2023 excavation conducted as part of the Urban Development of Ancient Petra project, a research team led by Niklas Jungmann of the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin studied the system that brought water into Petra. These included cisterns, basins, a reservoir with a dam, and the ‘Ain Braq aqueduct. In the course of their research, Jungmann and his team discovered something that the aqueduct had been hiding for millennia. It featured not just one, but two different main conduits that kept water flowing into Petra. Researchers had long known about the first channel lined with terracotta pipes to carry water into the city. What the researchers didn't expect was to unearth the imprint of a second conduit that once held a pressurized lead pipeline supplying water to basins and reservoirs on az-Zantur hill.

“The discovery of numerous water structures on the plateau directly above the rock slopes with the presumed aqueduct channel and the dam, raised broader questions about the engineering and chronology of this area,” Jungmann said in a study recently published in Levant. “As [the existence of a second conduit] was not mentioned in prior research, examining how the aqueduct entered the city became a primary research objective.”

Measuring roughly 380 feet (116 meters) in length, the newly-discovered pipeline used a welded metal pipe that was made of lead and encased in mortar. Further evidence that the Nabateans used a lead pipe in the second conduit includes its significantly larger diameter compared to the terracotta pipes found in the area, and the regular surface of the imprint it left behind in the underlying stone, as opposed to the irregular surface imprint typical of channels that held terracotta pipes. A later excavation backed this hypothesis when Nabatean conduit blocks were discovered during a survey of the city center. In the hardened mortar was section of lead pipe, whose imprint texture and dimensions matched those of the earlier find and left no more doubts about the overall composition of the aqueduct's second main conduit.

Jungmann concluded that such a long and narrow lead pipe was probably used as an inverted siphon within the ‘Ain Braq aqueduct. It was buried in concrete to transport water beneath the city, bypassing obstacles on the surface. Water in the system would have flowed through a header tank before entering the aqueduct's two conduits. Previously, one theory posited that the conduit could have taken a detour to supply water to another part of the city before arriving at its destination. However, the conduit was found to head west, probably to reach the reservoirs of az-Zantur hill. A detour would have not even been viable, since only an uninterrupted pipeline that generates enough internal pressure can allow water in a siphon to run from the header tank to the basin or reservoir it was meant to fill. 

“Overall, this study underscores the potential for further research into Nabataean water management,” said Jungmann. “While some hypotheses about the aqueduct's two branches into the city have been proposed above, more fieldwork is required in order to provide a fuller understanding of the distribution system and its evolution over time.”

In our three-dimensional space, elementary particles neatly filter into either bosons or fermions. But in lower dimensions, that distinction gets a bit murky.

Here's what you'll learn when reading this story:

When you drill down into the very fabric of reality—where elementary particles make up the matter that is you and me and everything around us in three-dimensional space—things get divided nicely into two categories: fermions and bosons. These two categories of particles are defined primarily by their atomic spin (in quantum mechanical terms), with bosons (photons, gluons, Higgs boson, W bosons, and Z bosons) having integer spin values and fermions (protons, neutrons, electrons, neutrinos) having half-integer spin values. While two bosons can occupy the same quantum state (which is why photons can pass through each other), two fermions can not—a good thing, since if they could, you'd fall through the floor right now.

But as is true of most things in science, things don't always line up so neatly. For example, for half a century, scientists have known  about the anyon, which exists in two-dimensional space. This quasiparticle is essentially anything between a boson and a fermion, which explains why American physicist Frank Wilczek named them “any-ons,” or simply anyons. However, it wasn't until 2020 that these weird particles were observed experimentally in one-atom thick (two-dimensional) semiconductors. “We had bosons and fermions, and now we've got this third kingdom,” Wilczek said at the time. “It's absolutely a milestone.”

Now, scientists from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) and the University of Oklahoma report the existence of a one-dimensional system in which anyons can exist. In two separate papers—both published in the journal Physical Review A—the researchers describe the recipe for adjustable anyons and their theoretical properties, exploring a new corner of this “third kingdom” of elementary particles. 

“Every particle in our universe seems to fit strictly into two categories: bosonic or fermionic. Why are there no others?” Thomas Busch, a co-author of both studies from OIST, said in a press statement. “With these works, we've now opened the door to improving our understanding of the fundamental properties of the quantum world and it's very exciting to see where theoretical and experimental physics take us from here.”

Anyons only exist in lower dimensions because, to put it very simply, particles in those dimensions have fewer options for moving around. Raúl Hidalgo-Sacoton (a Ph.D. student at OIST) describes the “exchange factor” that exists in 3D space—the property demanding that when two electrons swap places, they must obey a simple rule governing the mathematical statistics of the event: Its square must be equal to 1, meaning that all particles are either -1 (fermions) or 1 (bosons). 

In two dimensions, however, it's not so simple: “To satisfy the law of indistinguishability, we need exchange factors over a continuous range to account for the exchange, dependent on the exact twists and turns of the paths,” Hidalgo-Sacoto said in a press statement. And whatever lies in that range between -1 and 1 is considered an anyon. 

In this study, Busch, Hidalgo-Sacoto, and their colleague Doerte Blume (from the University of Oklahoma) found that this boson-fermion binary remains broken in one dimension, and they even discovered a method to specifically tune the exchange factor. Because of their limited movement in one dimension, particles must pass through each other, and this causes the exchange factor to differ from higher dimensions. This is likely connected to the strength of the short-range interaction between the particles. 

“We've identified not only the possibility of existence of one-dimensional anyons, but we've also shown how their exchange statistics can be mapped,” Busch said in a press statement. “We're thrilled to see what future discoveries are made in this area, and what it can tell us about the fundamental physics of our universe.”

Scientists at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and the RIKEN Center for Brain Science in Japan have identified two brain receptors that help regulate the breakdown of amyloid beta, the protein that builds up in Alzheimer's disease. Their findings suggest it may be possible to develop future medications that are both safer and more affordable than today's antibody based treatments.

Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia and is marked by sticky clumps of amyloid beta (Aβ) forming plaques in the brain. Normally, an enzyme called neprilysin helps clear away Aβ. However, neprilysin activity declines with aging and during the progression of the disease. The research team discovered that two somatostatin receptors, SST1 and SST4, work together to control neprilysin levels in the hippocampus, a region essential for memory. The findings were published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.

Boosting the Brain's Natural Defense System

The researchers conducted experiments using genetically modified mice and laboratory grown cells. When both SST1 and SST4 receptors were missing, neprilysin levels dropped. As a result, amyloid beta accumulated and the mice showed memory problems.

The team also tested a compound designed to activate these two receptors. In mice with Alzheimer's-like brain changes, stimulating SST1 and SST4 increased neprilysin levels, reduced amyloid beta buildup, and improved behavior. Importantly, the treatment did not cause serious side effects.

""Our findings show that the brain's own defence against amyloid beta can be strengthened by stimulating these receptors,"" says Per Nilsson, docent at the Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet.

Toward Safer and More Affordable Alzheimer's Drugs

Many of the most advanced Alzheimer's therapies currently rely on antibodies. While these treatments can target amyloid, they are extremely expensive and may trigger significant side effects in some patients.

""If we can instead develop small molecules that pass the blood-brain barrier, our hope is that we will be able to treat the disease at a significantly lower cost and without serious side effects,"" says Per Nilsson.

SST1 and SST4 belong to a large family of proteins known as G protein-coupled receptors. These receptors are common drug targets because they are well understood and often respond to medications that can be produced at lower cost and taken in pill form.

The project brought together researchers from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, RIKEN Center for Brain Science in Japan, and several other international universities. Funding was provided by organizations including the Swedish Research Council, the Hållsten Research Foundation, the Alzheimer's Foundation and the private initiative Innovative ways to fight Alzheimer´s disease -- Leif Lundblad Family and others and RIKEN. The researchers report no conflicts of interest.

Scientists have designed a powerful light based sensor capable of detecting extremely small amounts of cancer biomarkers in blood. The innovation could eventually allow doctors to identify early warning signs of cancer and other diseases through a routine blood draw.

Biomarkers such as proteins, fragments of DNA, and other molecules can signal whether cancer is present, how it is progressing, or a person's risk of developing it. The difficulty is that in the earliest stages of disease, these markers exist in extremely low concentrations, making them hard to measure with conventional tools.

""Our sensor combines nanostructures made of DNA with quantum dots and CRISPR gene editing technology to detect faint biomarker signals using a light-based approach known as second harmonic generation (SHG),"" said research team leader Han Zhang from Shenzhen University in China. ""If successful, this approach could help make disease treatments simpler, potentially improve survival rates and lower overall healthcare costs.""

In Optica, Optica Publishing Group's journal for high-impact research, Zhang and his team reported that the device detected lung cancer biomarkers in patient samples at sub-attomolar levels. Even when only a few molecules were present, the system produced a clear and measurable signal. Because the platform is programmable, it could potentially be adapted to identify viruses, bacteria, environmental toxins, or biomarkers linked to conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.

""For early diagnosis, this method holds promise for enabling simple blood screenings for lung cancer before a tumor might be visible on a CT scan,"" said Zhang. ""It could also help advance personalized treatment options by allowing doctors to monitor a patient's biomarker levels daily or weekly to assess drug efficacy, rather than waiting months for imaging results.""

Amplification Free Optical Sensing Technology

Most current biomarker tests require chemical amplification to increase tiny molecular signals, which adds time, complexity, and expense. The researchers aimed to create a direct detection strategy that eliminates those additional steps.

The system relies on SHG, a nonlinear optical phenomenon in which incoming light is converted into light with half the wavelength. In this design, SHG takes place on the surface of a two dimensional semiconductor called molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂).

To precisely position the sensing components, the team built DNA tetrahedrons, which are small pyramid shaped nanostructures formed entirely from DNA. These structures hold quantum dots at carefully controlled distances from the MoS₂ surface. The quantum dots intensify the local optical field and boost the SHG signal.

CRISPR-Cas gene editing technology was then incorporated to recognize specific biomarkers. When the Cas12a protein detects its target, it cuts the DNA strands that anchor the quantum dots. This action triggers a measurable drop in the SHG signal. Because SHG produces very little background noise, the system can detect extremely low biomarker concentrations with high sensitivity.

""Instead of viewing DNA only as a biological substance, we use it as programmable building blocks, allowing us to assemble the components of our sensor with nanometer-level precision,"" said Zhang. ""By combining optical nonlinear sensing, which effectively minimizes background noise, with an amplification-free design, our method offers a distinct balance of speed and precision.""

Successful Lung Cancer Testing in Human Serum

To evaluate real world performance, the researchers focused on miR-21, a microRNA biomarker associated with lung cancer. After confirming that the device could detect miR-21 in a controlled buffer solution, they tested it using human serum from lung cancer patients to simulate an actual blood test.

""The sensor worked exceptionally well, showing that integrating optics, nanomaterials and biology can be an effective strategy to optimize a device,"" said Zhang. ""The sensor was also highly specific -- ignoring other similar RNA strands and detecting only the lung cancer target.""

The next goal is to shrink the optical system. The researchers aim to develop a portable version that could be used at the bedside, in outpatient clinics, or in remote areas with limited medical resources.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","One in three people carry this brain parasite but the body has a kill switch","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260215225602.htm","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:31:26 GMT","

A parasite that may already be living in your brain has the ability to infect the very immune cells designed to eliminate it. New research from UVA Health explains how the body still manages to keep this infection under control.

Toxoplasma gondii is a potentially dangerous parasite that infects warm blooded animals. People are most often exposed through contact with cats, contaminated fruits or vegetables, or undercooked meat. After entering the body, the parasite can spread to multiple organs and eventually settle in the brain, where it can remain for life. Roughly one third of the global population is believed to carry Toxoplasma, yet most people never develop symptoms. When illness does occur, known as toxoplasmosis, it is most serious in individuals with weakened immune systems.

Researchers led by Tajie Harris, PhD, set out to understand how the immune system responds when Toxoplasma invades CD8+ T cells, which are specialized immune cells responsible for killing infected cells.

""We know that T cells are really important for combatting Toxoplasma gondii, and we thought we knew all the reasons why. T cells can destroy infected cells or cue other cells to destroy the parasite. We found that these very T cells can get infected, and, if they do, they can opt to die. Toxoplasma parasites need to live inside cells, so the host cell dying is game over for the parasite,"" said Harris, the director of the Center for Brain Immunology and Glia (BIG Center) at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. ""Understanding how the immune system fights Toxoplasma is important for several reasons. People with compromised immune systems are vulnerable to this infection, and now we have a better understanding of why and how we can help patients fight this infection.""

Caspase-8 and the Self-Destruct Defense

Harris and her team discovered that CD8+ T cells rely on a powerful enzyme called caspase-8 to control T. gondii. Caspase-8 plays a central role in regulating immune responses and can trigger a process that causes a cell to self-destruct.

In laboratory experiments, mice that lacked caspase-8 in their T cells developed far higher levels of T. gondii in their brains compared to mice whose T cells produced the enzyme. This happened even though both groups mounted strong immune responses against the infection.

The difference in outcomes was striking. Mice with caspase-8 remained healthy, while those without it became severely ill and died. Examination of their brain tissue showed that their CD8+ T cells were much more likely to be infected by the parasite.

These findings indicate that caspase-8 plays a crucial role in limiting T. gondii inside T cells. The results also add to growing evidence that this enzyme is broadly important in helping the body control infectious threats.

""We scoured the scientific literature to find examples of pathogens infecting T cells. We found very few examples,"" said Harris, part of UVA's Department of Neuroscience. ""Now, we think we know why. Caspase-8 leads to T cell death. The only pathogens that can live in CD8+ T cells have developed ways to mess with Caspase-8 function. Prior to our study, we had no idea that Caspase-8 was so important for protecting the brain from Toxoplasma.""

Study Details and Funding

The findings were published in the journal Science Advances. The research team included Lydia A. Sibley, Maureen N. Cowan, Abigail G. Kelly, NaaDedee A. Amadi, Isaac W. Babcock, Sydney A. Labuzan, Michael A. Kovacs, Samantha J. Batista, John R. Lukens and Harris. The scientists reported no financial conflicts of interest.

Funding for the research came from the National Institutes of Health, grants R01NS112516, R01NS134747, R21NS12855, T32GM008715, T32AI007496, T32AI007046, T32NS115657, F30AI154740, T32AI007496 and T32GM007267; a University of Virginia Pinn Scholars Award; a UVA Shannon Fellowship; and UVA's Strategic Investment Fund.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Majorana qubits decoded in quantum computing breakthrough","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260216084525.htm","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 03:04:56 GMT","

""This is a crucial advance,"" says Ramón Aguado, a CSIC researcher at the Madrid Institute of Materials Science (ICMM) and co author of the study. He explains that the team has successfully retrieved information stored in Majorana qubits by applying a technique known as quantum capacitance. According to Aguado, this method functions as ""a global probe sensitive to the overall state of the system,"" enabling scientists to access information that was previously difficult to observe.

To clarify the importance of the result, Aguado describes topological qubits as ""like safe boxes for quantum information."" Instead of keeping data in one fixed location, these qubits spread information across two linked quantum states called Majorana zero modes. Because the data is distributed in this way, it gains natural protection.

This structure makes topological qubits especially attractive for quantum computing. ""They are inherently robust against local noise that produces decoherence, since to corrupt the information, a failure would have to affect the system globally,"" Aguado explains. However, that same protective feature has posed a major challenge for researchers. As he notes, ""this same virtue had become their experimental Achilles' heel: how do you ""read"" or ""detect"" a property that doesn't reside at any specific point?""

Building the Kitaev Minimal Chain

To overcome this obstacle, the team engineered a modular nanostructure assembled from small components, similar to building with Lego blocks. This device, called a Kitaev minimal chain, consists of two semiconductor quantum dots connected through a superconductor.

Aguado explains that this approach allows researchers to construct the system from the ground up. ""Instead of acting blindly on a combination of materials, as in previous experiments, we create it bottom up and are able to generate Majorana modes in a controlled manner, which is in fact the main idea of our QuKit project."" This careful design gives scientists direct control over the formation of Majorana modes.

Real Time Measurement of Majorana Parity

After assembling the minimal Kitaev chain, the team applied the Quantum Capacitance probe. For the first time, they were able to determine in real time and with a single measurement whether the combined quantum state formed by the two Majorana modes was even or odd. In practical terms, this reveals whether the qubit is in a filled or empty state, which defines how it stores information.

""The experiment elegantly confirms the protection principle: while local charge measurements are blind to this information, the global probe reveals it clearly,"" says Gorm Steffensen, a researcher at ICMM CSIC who also participated in the study.

The researchers also detected ""random parity jumps,"" another significant outcome of the experiment. By analyzing these events, they measured ""parity coherence exceeding one millisecond,"" a duration considered highly promising for future operations involving topological qubits based on Majorana modes.

Collaboration Between Delft and ICMM CSIC

The study brings together an innovative experimental platform developed mainly at Delft University of Technology and theoretical work carried out at ICMM CSIC. The authors emphasize that the theoretical contribution was ""crucial for understanding this highly sophisticated experiment,"" highlighting the combined effort behind this advance in quantum computing.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Toxic metals found in bananas after Brazil mining disaster","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260217005756.htm","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 12:09:58 GMT","

Researchers in soil science, environmental engineering, and public health from the University of São Paulo (USP), the Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES) in Brazil, and the University of Santiago de Compostela in Spain investigated whether crops grown near the Doce River estuary are safe to eat. The area in Linhares, Espírito Santo, has been exposed to iron mining waste since the Fundão tailings dam collapsed in Minas Gerais in November 2015.

The team focused on bananas, cassava, and cocoa pulp cultivated in soil affected by the disaster. They examined levels of cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel, and lead, metals linked to iron oxides, which are the primary component of the tailings. Their findings suggest that eating bananas grown in contaminated soil may present a potential health risk for children six years old and younger.

""Our group has been studying the impacts of the dam collapse for years. We obtained the first samples seven days after the accident and immediately understood that there was an imminent risk of contamination of plants, soil, water, and fish. But the question remained: Does this contamination pose a risk to human health?"" recalls Tiago Osório, an agronomist and professor in the Department of Soil Science at the Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture at the University of São Paulo (ESALQ-USP).

The study, published in Environmental Geochemistry and Health, explains how plants absorb potentially toxic elements (PTEs) from mining waste and store them in edible tissues. It also outlines how these substances can move into the human food supply. The research forms part of Amanda Duim's doctoral work at ESALQ. Her thesis has produced seven international publications and earned two major awards in 2025: the USP Thesis Award in Sustainability and the Capes Thesis Award, granted by the Brazilian Ministry of Education's Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES). Duim received support from FAPESP through a doctoral scholarship.

How Contaminated Soil Transfers Metals Into Plants

Duim, the study's lead author, says the research stands out because it directly links human health risk to the movement of PTEs from soil into crops. ""The iron oxide content in the soil, which is the main constituent of the tailings, correlates with its content in the plant. We studied the passage of constituents from the tailings in the soil to the water, and then from the water to the plant, including its leaves and fruits.""

""First, we need to know which elements are there and in what quantities in order to understand the biochemical dynamics of their release,"" Osório explains.

Duim began her doctoral research in 2019 by exploring whether plants from flood-prone areas could help restore contaminated environments. She evaluated both cultivated crops and native species. ""We evaluated cultivated and native species. In the case of the latter, we wanted to know how they affect the dissolution of iron oxide and, in this process, understand if and how the PTEs associated with this waste enter the plant, since different species accumulate PTEs differently,"" she says. ""The idea was to find the best native species for cleaning up contaminated environments, and we found more than one species that can fulfill this function, with results already published. In the case of cultivated species, we wanted to know if PTEs would be transferred to the fruits and edible parts of the plants.""

To measure contamination, the researchers carefully collected soil and plant samples. They washed and weighed the fresh plants, then dried them and weighed them again. Roots, stems, leaves, and peeled fruits were ground separately for analysis. ""We dissolved the 'plant powder,' transforming it into a solution using various acids, and determined the concentration in the solution. We converted the calculation of the concentration of material in the solution and compared it with the weight of the diluted material, thus obtaining the PTE concentration in milligrams per kilogram of dry biomass,"" Duim describes.

In bananas and cassava, nearly all PTEs except chromium were found in higher amounts below ground, in roots and tubers. Cocoa behaved differently, with elevated levels in stems, leaves, and fruits. In cocoa pulp, copper and lead concentrations exceeded limits set by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

When the team discovered that some edible portions contained PTE levels above recommended standards, they conducted a formal health risk assessment.

Health Risk Assessment for Children and Adults

The scientists calculated the risk quotient (RQ), risk index (RI), and total risk index (TRI) for people consuming bananas, cassava rhizomes, and cocoa pulp. They evaluated children (under six years of age) and adults (over 18 years of age) separately. The RQ compares a person's estimated daily intake of a substance to a reference dose considered safe. The TRI helps determine potential non-carcinogenic health risk from exposure to PTEs. A TRI below 1 indicates low risk.

""These elements exist naturally in the environment. We're exposed to them in lower concentrations. But in the case of a disaster like the one in Mariana, when exposure is expected to increase, we need to exercise extra caution,"" says Tamires Cherubin, a health sciences Ph.D. and co-author of the study. Standard methods evaluate how bioavailable these elements are, since certain concentrations can lead to kidney and heart problems, gastrointestinal discomfort, and lung damage if inhaled. Short-term effects may also include skin irritation and eye problems.

The researchers factored in how much locally grown food residents consume, using data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). They also considered how long individuals might be exposed, differences in body weight between children and adults, and the time required for harmful effects to develop.

""According to the reference daily intake doses for contaminants covered by the literature, we consider the limits of 0.05 mg/kg-1 for the presence of cadmium in fruits and 0.1 mg/kg-1 in tubers, 0.5-1.0 mg/kg-1 for the presence of chromium, 20.0 mg/kg-1 for copper, 0.5-1.0 mg/kg-1 for nickel, 0.8-2.3 mg/kg-1 for lead, and 50.0 mg/kg-1 for zinc,"" Cherubin explains.

For most metals, TRI values were below 1, indicating no significant non-carcinogenic risk for adults consuming these foods from the Doce River estuary. However, the TRI for bananas exceeded 1 for children, signaling possible health concerns. Elevated lead levels were the primary driver, and cadmium concentrations in bananas also surpassed FAO recommendations. The researchers note that long-term exposure to lead, even at low levels, can permanently affect brain development, potentially lowering IQ and contributing to attention and behavioral problems.

Long-Term Cancer Concerns and Ongoing Exposure

The team cautions that eating food grown in contaminated soil over many years could lead to cumulative effects. ""Over time, considering the life expectancy in Brazil of around 75 years, there may be a carcinogenic risk since there's a possibility of direct and indirect DNA damage,"" says Cherubin. Such genetic damage may increase the likelihood of cancers affecting the central nervous system, digestive tract, and blood-forming tissues. ""It all depends on the human body's ability to absorb and metabolize these elements that are available in the environment,"" she adds.

A new study published in JACC, the flagship journal of the American College of Cardiology, suggests that the type of foods people choose on a low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet may be more important than simply cutting carbs or fat. Researchers found that when these diets focused on nutrient-dense, wholesome foods, they were linked to a lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). In contrast, versions built around refined carbohydrates and animal products were associated with higher CHD risk and less favorable metabolic health markers.

Low-carbohydrate and low-fat eating plans are common in the United States. However, scientists have not fully understood their long-term effects on heart health, especially when considering the quality of foods included in each pattern. This research stands out as one of the largest and most detailed investigations to date, examining diet quality, metabolomic data, and CHD risk in nearly 200,000 U.S. adults followed for more than 30 years.

Why Food Sources Matter in Low Carb and Low Fat Diets

""Our findings highlighted that it's not simply about cutting carbs or fat, but it's about the quality of foods people choose to construct those diets,"" said Zhiyuan Wu, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and lead author of the study. ""The efficacy of low-carb and low-fat diets in reducing CHD risk is a topic of ongoing debate, and past studies showed mixed findings.""

Wu noted that earlier research may have produced conflicting results because people can follow a low-carb or low-fat diet in very different ways. Some prioritize vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, while others rely more heavily on refined grains, processed foods, and animal-based fats.

""Focusing only on nutrient compositions but not food quality may not lead to health benefits,"" he said.

Large Long Term Study of Nearly 200,000 Adults

To better understand these differences, researchers analyzed data from 198,473 participants enrolled in three major cohort studies: the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHSII and Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Together, participants were tracked for more than 5.2 million person-years, during which 20,033 cases of CHD were recorded.

Dietary habits were measured using food frequency questionnaires. The research team then developed scoring systems to separate healthier and less healthy versions of low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets, based on the types of foods consumed and overall nutrient quality.

Healthy vs Unhealthy Diet Patterns

The analysis revealed several important patterns:

""These results suggest that healthy low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets may share common biological pathways that improve cardiovascular health,"" Wu said. ""Focusing on overall diet quality may offer flexibility for individuals to choose eating patterns that align with their preferences while still supporting heart health.""

Study Limitations and Broader Implications

The researchers cautioned that the findings may not apply to more extreme dietary approaches with very low carbohydrate or fat intake, such as ketogenic diets. The results should be interpreted within the ranges of macronutrient intake observed in the study. In addition, dietary information was self-reported, which can introduce measurement error. Because participants were health professionals with generally higher health awareness and better access to care, the findings may not fully represent the general population, although the biological mechanisms involved are unlikely to differ substantially.

""This study helps move the conversation beyond the long-standing debate over low-carbohydrate versus low-fat diets,"" said Harlan M. Krumholz, MD, Editor-in-Chief of JACC. ""The findings show that what matters most for heart health is the quality of the foods people eat. Whether a diet is lower in carbohydrates or fat, emphasizing plant-based foods, whole grains, and healthy fats is associated with better cardiovascular outcomes.""

Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase is a rate-limiting enzyme of de novo pyrimidine synthesis. In most eukaryotes, this enzyme is bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it couples orotate synthesis to ubiquinone reduction. As ubiquinone must be regenerated by respiratory complex III, pyrimidine biosynthesis and cellular respiration are tightly coupled. Consequently, inhibition of respiration suppresses DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Here we show that expression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae URA1 gene (ScURA) in mammalian cells uncouples pyrimidine biosynthesis from mitochondrial electron transport. ScURA forms a homodimer in the cytosol that uses fumarate as an electron acceptor instead of ubiquinone, enabling respiration-independent pyrimidine biosynthesis. Cells expressing ScURA are resistant to drugs that inhibit complex III and the mitochondrial ribosome. Additionally, ScURA enables growth of mitochondrial-DNA-lacking ρ0 cells in uridine-deficient medium and ameliorates the phenotype of cellular models of mitochondrial diseases. Overall, this genetic tool uncovers the contribution of pyrimidine biosynthesis to the phenotypes arising from electron transport chain defects.

Cells obtain pyrimidine nucleotides for DNA and RNA synthesis either by de novo biosynthesis or by salvage of preformed bases1. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) catalyses the fourth step of the biosynthetic pathway: oxidation of dihydroorotate (DHO) to orotate. In most eukaryotes, DHODH is bound to the external surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it uses ubiquinone (UQ) as an electron acceptor. Once UQ is reduced by DHODH, it is re-oxidized by respiratory complex III. Therefore, DHODH activity couples pyrimidine biosynthesis with the mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC)2. The biochemical consequence of this coupling is that de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis is not possible in the absence of mitochondrial electron transport: the failure to re-oxidize UQH2 to UQ causes a build-up in the UQH2/UQ ratio, depleting the pool of UQ that DHODH requires to function. This explains why cells lacking mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or treated with mitochondrial inhibitors affecting complexes III or IV benefit from exogenous uridine supplementation to grow3,4,5,6.

Organisms that are capable of growing in the absence of oxygen must produce orotate through a different mechanism. Here, DHODH is either linked to an alternative ETC or is a cytosolic enzyme that uses either NAD+ or fumarate as electron acceptors7,8,9. In these organisms, pyrimidine biosynthesis can thus proceed independently of cellular respiration. In yeast, the distribution of DHODH isoenzymes across various species appears to mirror their growth preferences: aerobic species harbour a mitochondrial DHODH, whereas facultative anaerobes possess a cytosolic DHODH10. Anaerobic yeasts seem to have acquired the cytosolic DHODH gene by horizontal transfer from a bacterial source and to subsequently have lost their eukaryotic gene11. Oxygen-independent pyrimidine biosynthesis is therefore one of the main adaptations that enabled anaerobic growth12.

The reason why evolution favoured the coupling of pyrimidine biosynthesis with the mETC remains unknown. In this work, we asked whether it is possible to uncouple these two processes in mammalian cells by expressing the gene encoding cytosolic DHODH.

In aerobic eukaryotes, DHODH shuttles electrons through UQ to complex III and functions as a respiratory enzyme13. Other unicellular organisms have evolved different versions of DHODH, which use either fumarate or NAD+ as electron acceptors to oxidize DHO. These isoenzymes typically lack a mitochondrial import signal and a transmembrane domain, residing instead in the cytosol (Fig. 1a).

To enable mETC-independent de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, we ectopically expressed Saccharomyces cerevisiae URA1 gene (ScURA) in mammalian cells (Fig. 1b). The yeast gene's cDNA was codon-optimized for mammalian expression, and a myc tag was added at the carboxyl terminus through a flexible (GGS)3 linker to prevent steric interference between the tag and the enzyme (Supplementary Data). The gene was cloned into a lentiviral vector, and an empty vector was used as the control for all subsequent experiments. In human 143B cells, we were able to detect ScURA expression by western blot (Fig. 1c). Previous studies have shown that S. cerevisiae URA1 is a cytosolic protein that forms homodimers14. Accordingly, when 143B homogenates were separated by native, non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), we observed that ScURA migrated more slowly than expected for its monomeric mass (36 kDa) and toward the expected size of the homodimer (Fig. 1d). When we tested DHODH enzymatic activity in cell homogenates, we found that ScURA-expressing cells possessed 2.25 times more activity than controls (Fig. 1e). Approximately two-thirds of this activity was insensitive to brequinar inhibition, as brequinar targets the UQ binding site of human DHODH, which is not present in ScURA15. Therefore, ScURA expression provides an alternative pathway for DHO dehydrogenation in human cells.

Under normal cell culture conditions, DHODH activity is not a rate-limiting factor for cell proliferation, and exogenous uridine supplementation is unnecessary (Fig. 2a). Consistently, expression of ScURA did not affect cell proliferation or mitochondrial function and morphology in 143B cells (Fig. 2b–d and Extended Data Fig. 1). To test whether ScURA could replace the endogenous DHODH activity in proliferating cells, we treated 143B cells with brequinar and rescued pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibition by supplementing uridine in the growth medium. Brequinar suppressed cell proliferation in control cells, which was fully restored upon uridine supplementation (Fig. 2e). On the other hand, in ScURA-expressing cells, brequinar had no discernible effect on cell proliferation. We next used CRISPR–Cas9 to generate DHODH knockout (KO) 143B cells (Fig. 2f). As expected, these cells required exogenous uridine to proliferate (Fig. 2g). We then reintroduced ScURA, human DHODH (hDHODH) or hDHODH lacking its mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) and the transmembrane domain (hDHODH-ΔMTS) using a lentiviral vector. Re-expression of either hDHODH or ScURA was sufficient to restore uridine-independent cell proliferation, while the hDHODH-ΔMTS variant failed to rescue the phenotype. Furthermore, uridine supplementation offered no additional growth advantage to cells expressing ScURA, demonstrating that it fully compensates for the loss of mitochondrial DHODH. To directly measure the flux through de novo pyrimidine synthesis, we cultured wild-type (WT) and ScURA-expressing cells with [α-15N]glutamine (Fig. 2h), whose nitrogen specifically labels the pyrimidine rings on pyrimidine nucleotides such as uridine triphosphate (UTP) and cytidine triphosphate (CTP). We observed similar rates of UTP and CTP labelling in both cell lines under basal conditions (Fig. 2i,j). Chemical inhibition of DHODH (with brequinar) or of the mETC (with antimycin and myxothiazol) ablated labelling in WT cells. By contrast, ScURA-expressing cells maintained UTP and CTP synthesis in both conditions. These results demonstrate that ScURA enables brequinar-insensitive de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis in human cells by bypassing mitochondrial DHODH.

The dependency of pyrimidine biosynthesis on the mETC was first discovered in chick embryo cells treated with chloramphenicol, which were found to be auxotrophic for uridine5. Chloramphenicol, a mitochondrial ribosome inhibitor, impedes the assembly of respiratory complexes and the ATP synthase, blocking the electron flux through the mETC. Therefore, we investigated whether ScURA expression could restore pyrimidine biosynthesis and rescue cell proliferation in cells treated with chloramphenicol. To this end, we cultured 143B cells in chloramphenicol and uridine for 1 week before assessing their ability to grow without uridine. Although uridine supplementation was essential to maintain proliferation in WT cells, ScURA-expressing cells were able to grow at the same rate in the absence of uridine (Fig. 3a). We next sought to investigate whether ScURA could rescue cell proliferation when ubiquinol oxidation by complex III was disrupted. We treated cells with both antimycin A and myxothiazol to completely block electron flow through complex III16,17,18, rendering cells auxotrophic for uridine3 (Fig. 3b,c). Under these conditions, ScURA expression was able to maintain cell proliferation at the same level as uridine supplementation (Fig. 3b). WT cells treated with antimycin A and myxothiazol could not be maintained past a single passage, in contrast to cells supplemented with uridine or carrying ScURA, which could be kept under complex III inhibition indefinitely. We next used semi-targeted metabolomics to address how ScURA-driven metabolic changes may support proliferation in 143B cells (Fig. 3d,e). ScURA-expressing cells displayed a decrease in DHO and an increase in orotate, which are the substrate and the product of the ScURA reaction, respectively (Fig. 3e,f). Although mETC inhibition in WT cells caused a massive (>600-fold) accumulation of DHO, this metabolite remained below the limit of detection in ScURA-expressing cells under the same conditions (Fig. 3f). The pools of free pyrimidines were decreased when cells expressed ScURA in basal conditions; however, ScURA expression was able to rescue the loss of UTP and CTP caused by mETC inhibition (Fig. 3f). Therefore, ScURA allows mETC-independent de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis in human cells. We also observed accumulation of flavin mononucleotide, the cofactor of ScURA, and a shift in urea cycle intermediates towards arginine synthesis, which is coupled with the production of fumarate, the substrate of ScURA (Fig. 3g). In conclusion, these results support the notion that ScURA restores proliferation upon ETC inhibition largely by supplying pyrimidines.

ScURA takes reducing equivalents from DHO and deposits them onto fumarate instead of UQ, generating succinate, which in turn can then feed the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Therefore, we investigated the impact of this metabolic shift by stable isotope tracing of [U-13C]glutamine (Fig. 4a), which allowed us to track the fate of TCA cycle metabolites. We compared metabolite abundance and labelling patterns between WT and ScURA-expressing cells, both in control conditions and upon acute mETC inhibition. In control conditions, we did not observe any accumulation of succinate in ScURA-expressing cells, probably because succinate can re-enter the TCA cycle and be converted to fumarate by succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) (Fig. 4b). However, the pools of other TCA cycle intermediates changed: α-ketoglutarate, malate and acetyl-CoA increased while citrate decreased, with a consequent increase of the α-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio (Fig. 4b,c and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b), a known determinant of reductive carboxylation19. Accordingly, the labelling pattern of citrate, aspartate and malate changed when ScURA was expressed, indicating reductive carboxylation metabolism (Fig. 4d,e). The above observations fit a model in which de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis is sustained by ScURA by creating a cycle of fumarate and succinate between the cytosol and the mitochondria (Fig. 4a). Given that the ScURA reaction causes a substantial flux of succinate into the TCA cycle, α-ketoglutarate accumulates, increasing the α-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio and driving reductive carboxylation.

Blocking UQH2 oxidation prevents cells from oxidizing succinate, causing it to accumulate. This accumulation may be further increased by SDH reverse activity20,21,22. Here, ScURA expression modified the way succinate is produced: instead of being derived from α-ketoglutarate oxidation as in WT cells ([13C4]succinate or (m+4)), an important fraction of succinate was labelled as [13C3]succinate (m+3), with the labelling characteristic of reductive carboxylation (Fig. 4f). Citrate, malate and aspartate labelling also followed the same pattern. Therefore, the rate of oxidative carboxylation is enhanced in cells expressing ScURA and provides fumarate as an electron acceptor for DHO oxidation. We could not directly quantify fumarate with our metabolomic experiment. Therefore, we used S-(2-succino)-cysteine (2-SC), the product of the reaction between fumarate and cysteine, as a proxy for fumarate labelling (Fig. 4g). The m+3 labelling of 2-SC is consistent with fumarate being produced by reductive carboxylation and becoming the electron acceptor of the reaction catalysed by ScURA (Fig. 4h). ScURA was also able to restore the growth defect caused by mETC inhibition in two cell lines lacking SDH, excluding that ScURA activity depends on fumarate reduction through reverse SDH reaction20 (143B and U2OS SDHAKO; Extended Data Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that cells adjust their TCA flux to compensate for succinate production by ScURA.

We next asked whether ScURA expression leads to changes in gene expression by RNA sequencing. We found that 113 genes were differentially expressed between ScURA and WT cells in basal conditions (adjusted P < 0.05 and absolute log2(fold change) > 1; Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed an enrichment for pathways related to interferon production, hypoxia and cellular responses to oxygen levels (Extended Data Fig. 4c). To identify the regulators driving these changes, we inferred transcription factor activity using decoupleR23. This analysis revealed HIF1α as the most differentially active transcription factor, with a corresponding elevation in a group of its known target genes (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e). This observation is consistent with the finding that cytosolic succinate can stabilize HIF1α24.

The transcriptional impact of ScURA was far more pronounced upon mETC inhibition. In both 143B WT and ScURA-expressing cells, the integrated stress response was activated, with ATF4 being the top induced transcription factor, consistent with previous reports25 (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c), and ScURA-expressing cells activated genes involved in the integrated stress response similarly to WT cells (Extended Data Fig. 5b). We also noted that although the inferred transcriptional activity of MYC was blunted in both lines, the effect was less severe in ScURA-expressing cells, reflecting their sustained proliferation during mETC inhibition. When we analysed differentially expressed genes by gene set enrichment analysis in these conditions, the gene set that clearly stood out was cytoplasmic translation (Extended Data Fig. 5d). Indeed, complex III inhibition led to a profound downregulation of ribosomal protein mRNAs in WT cells. ScURA expression completely rescued this phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 5e). Ribosomal protein downregulation is a recognized consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction25. In the absence of a functional mETC, the shortage of CTP and UTP limits the transcription of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, while ScURA allows ribosomal protein mRNA synthesis by providing an alternative source of pyrimidines.

We next sought to use ScURA in cellular models of mitochondrial diseases. Cells depleted of mtDNA, known as ρ0 cells, are dependent on uridine and pyruvate for growth4. We therefore asked whether we could revert the uridine auxotrophy in ρ0 cells with ScURA. Transduction of two ρ0 cell lines, mouse L929 ρ0 and human 143B ρ0, with the ScURA gene allowed growth in the absence of uridine, while maintaining their pyruvate dependence (Fig. 5a,b and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). In 143B ρ0 cells, ScURA was able to drive DHO oxidation and synthesis of UTP and CTP (Fig. 5c–e). Mitochondrial diseases are a heterogeneous group of maladies with extremely variable clinical manifestations; they are poorly predictable and often lack an effective treatment. Cell lines derived from patients suffering from defects in respiratory complexes benefit from uridine supplementation26. Expression of the alternative oxidase (AOX) from Ciona intestinalis in human 293T cells confers cyanide resistance to cells27. Equally, expression of AOX from Emericella nidulans in mouse L929 ρ0 cells rescues uridine auxotrophy28. In mouse and human cells deficient for complex III or complex IV, AOX can also rescue uridine auxotrophy, ameliorating their metabolic phenotype29,30. In these scenarios, AOX restores the electron flux through the mETC, bypassing respiratory complex III and complex IV, allowing pyrimidine biosynthesis. To examine the implications of ScURA expression in cellular models of mitochondrial diseases, we expressed ScURA in Mt-Cybmut cells, which lack respiratory complex III because of a point mutation in the mtDNA cyb gene3, and in Cox10KO cells, which cannot assemble respiratory complex IV because of the absence of the COX10 assembly factor31 (Extended Data Fig. 6c). ScURA expression enabled the growth of both cell lines in the absence of uridine (Fig. 5f,g and Extended Data Fig. 6d,e). We concluded that the growth defects caused by pathological mutations in mitochondrial genes can be alleviated by ScURA.

The ectopic expression of enzyme orthologs from other phyla has been a valuable tool for investigation of the mETC. For example, Lactobacillus brevis NADH oxidase generates NAD+, bypassing complex I, and has been used extensively both in cellular and animal models32,33. C. intestinalis AOX, which substitutes complex III and IV27, and S. cerevisiae NDI1, which substitutes complex I34, are being explored as therapeutic approaches for mitochondrial diseases5,35. We have extended this genetic toolkit with ScURA, which provides a mETC-independent pathway for orotate production.

The reason why most eukaryotes rely on a mitochondrial DHODH is unknown. The connection between DHODH and mitochondrial electron transport could help to fine-tune key metabolic processes such as DNA and RNA synthesis with oxygen and nutrient availability. When oxygen supply is limited, a reduction in complex III and IV activity would deplete the UQ pool, slowing down pyrimidine biosynthesis and cell growth36. Decreased pyrimidine levels might, in turn, stimulate respiratory supercomplex assembly by ether phospholipid accumulation37. A mitochondrial DHODH might therefore support proliferation only in favourable environments.

Oxidation of DHO is a fundamental reaction for living beings and requires a suitable electron acceptor. In eukaryotes, this process is accomplished mainly by three alternative strategies. Aerobes use oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor, which is reduced by DHODH through the mETC9. In anaerobic eukaryotes, there are two alternative modes of DHO oxidation, both of which use fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor. Many multicellular organisms that inhabit hypoxic environments oxidize DHO by a membrane DHODH, which transfers electrons to rhodoquinone and a membrane-associated fumarate reductase8. Some yeasts, instead, acquired a bacterial DHODH through horizontal gene transfer, which can directly reduce fumarate10. Recently, rhodoquinone has been found in some mammalian tissues, where it can allow mitochondrial electron transport from ubiquinol to fumarate independently of oxygen38. Experiments that combine the expression of ScURA and the induction of rhodoquinone synthesis could shed light on why eukaryotes have maintained membrane-associated reactions throughout evolution, instead of adopting soluble and more direct enzymatic workarounds.

It has been shown that during hypoxia, ubiquinol can be oxidized by reverse SDH activity, allowing DHODH catalysis independently of complex III function20. This pathway can contribute to pyrimidine biosynthesis when complex III is inhibited if exogenous aspartate (or an exogenous electron acceptor such as pyruvate) is given to overcome the deficit in aspartate biosynthesis20,39,40. Given that our experiments were conducted in media complemented with dialysed serum and lacking exogenous aspartate or pyruvate, aspartate deficiency may explain why neither ScURA expression nor uridine supplementation could fully restore cell proliferation to control levels. Further investigation is required to address how nutrient availability constrains the efficacy of metabolic adaptations to respiratory deficiency.

ScURA allowed us to evaluate the contribution of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis to cellular growth independently of cellular respiration. In recent years, genetically engineered mouse models have enabled the study of a wide spectrum of cell-type-specific functions. With this approach, the integrity of the mETC has been shown to be essential for haematopoiesis41, angiogenesis42, regulatory and natural killer T cells functions43 and many more. Such dependence is often assayed by genetic disruption and pharmacologic inhibition of single mitochondrial respiratory complexes. By this approach, the activity of all UQ-dependent dehydrogenases is blocked, raising the question of which mETC-dependent process is responsible for the observed phenotype. The relative contribution of each UQ-dependent pathway can be assessed only by ectopic expression of UQ-independent dehydrogenases in vivo33,42. In this way, the development of effective and precise pharmacological intervention strategies can be undertaken following a precise mechanistic rationale. We designed ScURA following this same logic.

One key issue that we think ScURA will help to disentangle is the metabolic requirements of tumour growth. Human tumour cells in which the integrity of mETC is disrupted cannot form tumours when injected subcutaneously into immunocompromised mice44. However, it has been shown in syngeneic models that tumour cells are able to uptake mtDNA from the host, and pyrimidine biosynthesis has been suggested to be the main limiting factor for their growth45. Interestingly, as it happened with the expression of AOX25, ρ0 cells expressing ScURA still needed pyruvate supplementation to grow, stressing that some activity of the mETC, probably respiratory complex I, is essential. ScURA expression in respiratory-deficient tumour cells will provide a straightforward model to directly test this and other hypotheses in vivo.

A promising future area for the application of ScURA and other ectopic enzymes is in the treatment of mitochondrial diseases through adeno-associated virus gene therapy. For example, expression of NDI1 and AOX has been shown to improve the survival of pre-clinical models of complex I and III deficiencies, respectively35,46. ScURA gene delivery could also be beneficial in patients suffering from Miller's syndrome, a rare genetic disease characterized by mutations in DHODH47.

Cells were grown in complete DMEM medium (D5796, containing 4,500 mg l−1 glucose, 2 mM L-glutamine) supplemented with dialysed 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich, F7524), 1% penicillin–streptomycin (PenStrep, Lonza), at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Where indicated, 50 μg ml−1 uridine and/or 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the growing media. Inhibitors were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as follows: brequinar (2 μM); antimycin A and myxothiazol (20 μM each); and chloramphenicol (40 μg ml−1). Cells were pre-treated with chloramphenicol for 1 week in the presence of uridine to deplete them of respiratory complexes48. Control cells were treated with the appropriate vehicle (ethanol or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)). The origin of cell lines was: ρ0 cells49, Mt-Cybmut and Cox10KO AOX-expressing cells29.

The coding sequence of ScURA was obtained from a previous publication50 and modified as follows. A myc tag was added at the C terminus through a (GGS)3 linker, and at both ends, restriction enzyme sites were inserted. Codon-optimization and oligonucleotide synthesis were performed by Genewiz. The gene was cloned into the pWXLd lentiviral vector (modified from Trono's lab with a puromycin resistance gene, Addgene). Lentivirus production was carried out by the Viral Vector unit at Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC). Viral supernatants were filtered and added to cells with 8 μg ml−1 polybrene overnight. Then, 2 days after transduction, ScURA-expressing cells were selected with puromycin 0.5 μg ml−1 for approximately 1 week until non-transduced cells in a control plate were dead. For each cell line, a cell line transduced with an empty vector was used as a control.

On day 0, a total of 40,000 cells were plated into six-well plates. For each condition, three wells were incubated for 6 h (to allow the cells adhere to the plate), collected and counted. This count was recorded as the number of cells at day 0. For 3–4 days, fresh media and the appropriate treatments were added to each well every day. On the last day, three wells per condition were collected and counted. The number of doublings pre day was calculated as 24 / ((T × (ln2)) / (ln(nf / n0))), where T is time in hours, nf is the number of cells on the final day and n0 is the number of cells at day 0.

Cells from two to ten 150 mm plates were collected with trypsin, washed in PBS and resuspended in cold sucrose buffer (0.32 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4). Cells were then homogenized in a Teflon potter-type tissue homogenizer with 20–40 ‘pops'. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000g for 5 min, the nuclear pellet was discarded and the post-nuclear whole-cell homogenate was stored at −80 °C. When mitochondria were isolated, the whole-cell homogenate obtained was further centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min. The pellet obtained was resuspended in sucrose buffer and stored at −80 °C.

DHODH activity was measured following a previously published method51, with some modifications: 100 µg of whole-cell homogenates were used for each reaction in a final volume of 200 µl. Each biological replicate was split into three technical replicates. DHODH-dependent reduction of 2,6-dichloroindophenol (DCPIP) was measured with a UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a 96-well plate reader. Samples were resuspended in reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM KCl, 3 mM KCN, 0.05 mM DCPIP, 0.25 mM decylubiquinone, pH 7.5) and incubated for 2 min at 37 °C. The reaction was started by the addition of 1 mM DHO. The first 3 min of the reaction were linear and were used for the analysis. The rate of background (DHODH-independent) DCPIP reduction was measured in parallel by omitting DHO from the reaction mixture and was subtracted from the DHO-dependent rate for each sample. Brequinar was added where indicated at 0.05 mM; controls were treated with the same volume of DMSO.

All gels were prepared in-house with Tris-HCl buffer and acrylamide/bis. Protein samples were quantified and loaded on the gel, and electrophoresis was performed in Tris-glycine solution. For denaturing electrophoresis, 0.1% SDS was added to the gels and protein samples were incubated for 1 min at 95 °C in loading buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromophenol blue) before loading. For non-denaturing native gels, SDS was not added to the gel, whole-cell homogenates were not boiled and the loading buffer used did not contain SDS or β-mercaptoethanol.

Proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane (Immobilon-FL, 0.45 μm) by transfer in BioRad Mini Trans-Blot Cell or Trans-Blot Cell systems, in 48 mM Tris, 39 mM glycine and 20% methanol transfer solution overnight at 30 V. The membrane was then blocked in 0.1% PBS-Tween, 5% BSA solution for 1 h at room temperature (22 °C) and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. After that, the membrane was incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Membrane development was performed using fluorescent secondary antibody and revealed with the Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). Antibodies used included anti-hemoagglutinin-tag (1:5,000; Sigma-Aldrich, sAB 4300603), anti-betaActin (1:10,000; Sigma-Aldrich, A2066), anti-GAPDH (1:5,000; Abcam, AB8245) and anti-SDHA (1:5,000; Invitrogen, 459200 or Proteintech, 14865-1-AP).

The procedure was carried out as detailed previously48. In brief, 100 μg of mitochondria were incubated with 400 μg of digitonin for 5 min in 50 mM NaCl buffer, 50 mM imidazole, 5 mM aminocaproic acid at a final concentration of 10 μg μl−1. Electrophoresis was performed in a cold chamber and developed for 30 min at 90 V with cathode buffer A. Then, the cathode buffer was exchanged for cathode buffer B, and electrophoresis continued for approximately 1 h more at 300 V. Measurement of NADH dehydrogenase activity of complex I was determined on the same gel after blue native–PAGE electrophoresis by incubating the gel in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.14 mM NADH and 1 mg ml−1 NitroBlue tetrazolium solution at room temperature.

ATP synthesis was assessed as previously described52. In brief, 1.5 billion cells were permeabilized with digitonin and ATP synthesis was assayed using glutamate plus malate or succinate as fuels in the presence of adenosine 5′-diphosphate and diadenosine pentaphosphate (to inhibit the adenylyl kinase) by a kinetic luminescence assay using the luciferin–luciferase reaction.

A total of 10,000 cells were plated in a Seahorse XF96 microplate the day before the assay. Cells were washed in MAS medium (70 mM sucrose, 220 mM mannitol, 5 mM KH2PO4, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM HEPES pH 7.4) containing 0.2% w/v free fatty acid BSA and then placed in MAS media containing ADP and digitonin (4 mM and 10 µg ml−1 final concentrations, respectively), incubated for 3 min at 37 °C and then loaded in the instrument. Substrate injection was as follows: glutamate + malate (5 mM each, port A); rotenone (2 µM, port B); succinate (5 mM, port C); antimycin A (1 µM, port D). These conditions allow for the determination of the respiratory capacity of mitochondria through complex I and complex II. For measuring activities of mitochondrial complexes, frozen–thawed cells were used as previously detailed53.

The amino acid sequence of DHODH from various species was retrieved from UniProt. The R packages msa54, ape55 and ggmsa56 were used for multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree construction and generation.

In total, 20,000 cells were seeded per well on a 12-well plate containing previously sterilized precision cover glasses (Marienfeld, 0117520) and left incubating at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in their corresponding medium. After 48 h, cells were fixed for 15 min at 37 °C in pre-warmed 4% paraformaldehyde (ThermoFisher, 043368.9M) diluted in 1× PBS, followed by three washes in 1× PBS. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X100 in 1× PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked in 2% BSA (w/v) in 1× PBS, then incubated with a Tomm20-CL488 antibody (1:500) (Proteintech, 30235116) diluted in blocking buffer. Cells were then incubated in Alexa Fluor 405 N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester (1:5,000) (ThermoFisher, A30000) diluted in 1× PBS. All incubation steps were performed for 40 min at room temperature and followed by three 5 min washes in 1× PBS-Tween 0.1%. Samples were finally mounted on microscopy slides using ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent (Invitrogen, P36934).

All microscopy images were collected on a Leica SP5 inverted confocal microscope equipped with a HCX PL APO λ blue ×63, 1.40 NA oil objective. Z-stacks containing 10 planes (with a step size of 0.34 µm) were acquired in a sequential line scanning mode using LAS-AF (v.2.6.0) software (Leica Microsystems) at a digital zoom of ×2, pixel size of 60 nm, scanner speed of 200 Hz and 3 line averages, with a pinhole size of 1 AU. The Tomm20 signal was excited using the Argon 488 laser line at 10% intensity, and the corresponding 505–555 nm emission was collected using a PMT detector set at 800 V gain and −0.1% offset. The NHS405 signal was excited using the UV diode 405 laser line at 2% intensity, and 420–485 nm emission was collected using a PMT detector at 900 V gain and −1% offset.

Image analysis was mainly performed in FIJI 1.53t. Z-stacks were first projected into a single plane using the maximum intensity method. For mitochondria, the signal of Ch2 (NHS405) was subtracted to that of Ch1 (Tomm20-CL488) and the resulting image was then thresholded with the Mitochondria Analyzer plugin57 using the following parameters: remove particles (size, ≤0.1 µm2), subtract background (rolling, 2.0), sigma filter plus (radius, 2.0), enhance local contrast (max slope, 3.0), weighted mean threshold (block size, 1.45; C-value, 5.0) and despeckle and remove outliers (pixels, 4.0). Individual networks were isolated from whole thresholded images, and morphology parameters of mitochondria were calculated on a per-cell basis. For analysis of cell morphology, the NHS405 channel was first pre-processed in FIJI by applying CLAHE (block, 500; bin, 256; slope, 10) and a Gaussian blur (radius, 0.3 µm). The objects were then thresholded and their morphology analysed in Cellprofiler (v.4.2.8)58 using an adaptive Otsu method with three classes.

U2OS (ATCC, HTB-96) and 143B (ATCC, CRL-8303) SDHAKO clonal cell lines were generated through nucleofection (Neon transfection system, Invitrogen) of ribonucleoprotein complexes prepared by incubating 2 µg of TrueCut Cas9 Protein v2 (Invitrogen, A36499) and 2 µg of a pair of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) (sgRNA 1 target sequence at intron 1, AACCCTGAAGGCAGCCCAAG; sgRNA 2 target sequence at exon 4, GGGCCTGCTCCGTCATGTAG). DNA oligonucleotides used for sgRNA synthesis were designed using the CRISPOR algorithm (http://crispor.tefor.net), and sgRNAs were synthesized using the GeneArt Precision gRNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, A29377). Nucleofection was carried out at 1230 V or 1300 V (four pulses of 10 ms) for U2OS or 143B cells, respectively. Following nucleofection, cells were seeded into six-well plates and allowed to recover for 48 h. For single-cell clone isolation, cells were sorted using a spectral cell sorter (Cytek Aurora CS). Genomic DNA was extracted, and a pair of primers (primer 1A, GAGTGTGCATCCGACATCCTC; primer 2A, CTCATCACCATTCTTTTGGCTG) flanking SDHA-targeted regions was used to perform PCR screening. Clones were considered positive for gene editing when the amplified product was 551 bp, indicating deletion of the whole DNA fragment between targeted regions. The absence of SDHA protein was confirmed by western blot against SDHA (Santa Cruz, sc-166909), performed following separation of total cell protein extracts on 10% SDS–PAGE gels. Positive clones were further validated by Sanger sequencing of the SDHA gene.

A clonal 143B-DHODHKO cell line was generated by following a previously published protocol59, with slight modifications. Each pair of gene-specific sgRNAs (pair 1, CCGCGGAGGACTACGCAGAA; pair 2, ATAGAAACGCTCATCTCCCG) targeting different regions of the gene was cloned into a TCLV2 plasmid (Addgene, 87360)60. Lentiviral particles were made in the Viral Vectors Unit at CNIC. All 143B cells were seeded on six-well plates, and at 80% confluency, they were transduced with lentiviral particles in DMEM supplemented with only 2% FBS, which was changed the following day for fresh complete medium. After 48 h, infected cells were selected by treatment with 1 µg ml−1 puromycin in complete DMEM. After 48 h, surviving cells were treated with 2 µg ml−1 doxycycline to induce Cas9-2A-eGFP expression and were then sorted into a 96-well plate at one cell per well using a FACSAria cell sorter. Final clones were selected by observing cell death in medium lacking uridine and confirmed by running total cell protein extracts on a 12.5% SDS–PAGE gel and performing a western blot against DHODH (1:1,000) (Santa Cruz, sc166348).

The 143B-DHODHKO cells were used to re-express a WT version of hDHODH, a version of the protein lacking the mitochondria peptide signal and the transmembrane alpha helix (hDHODHΔMTS) and codon-optimized ScURA protein fused to a c-Myc tag (ScURA-myc). The vectors used were constructed and packaged by VectorBuilder, and the lentiviral particles were generated by the Viral Vectors Unit at CNIC. 143B-DHODHKO cells were seeded on six-well plates, and at 80% confluency, they were transduced with lentiviral particles in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, which was changed the following day for fresh complete medium containing uridine. Infected cells were selected by treatment with 400 µg ml−1 hygromycin B for at least 4 days. Re-expression of the proteins was confirmed by running total cell protein extracts on a 12.5% SDS–PAGE gel and performing a western blot against DHODH (1:1,000) (Santa Cruz, sc166348) and c-myc (1:5,000).

For each condition, cells were seeded in six-well plates (with one plate kept aside for cell counting) in DMEM + 10% dialysed FBS, no uridine. The day after seeding, media containing inhibitors (1 μM each antimycin and myxothiazol, 2 μM brequinar) and radio-labelled tracers (2 mM [α-15N]glutamine or [U-13C]glutamine; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) were added. After 24 h of incubation, metabolites were extracted in metabolite extraction buffer (50% methanol, 30% acetonitrile, 20% water (all liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry grade), 5 µM valine-d8, CK isotopes and DLM-488). Cells were washed with PBS, and 500 μl of cold metabolite extraction buffer per million cells was added to the wells; the plate was then immediately placed at −80 °C for 20 min. The cell lysate–extraction buffer solution mixture was shaken at maximum speed for 15 min at 4 °C, centrifuged at 13,000g for 30 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was collected in a HPLC vial. A pooled sample was prepared by taking 15 μl from each individual sample.

Metabolites were separated on a Millipore SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC analytical column (5 µm, 2.1 × 150 mm) coupled to a guard column (2.1 × 20 mm, 5 µm). The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (20 mM ammonium carbonate with 2.5 µM medronic acid, adjusted to pH 9.7 with ammonium hydroxide) and solvent B (acetonitrile in water, 95:5, v/v). The column oven was maintained at 40 °C, and the autosampler was kept at 4 °C. Chromatography was performed at a flow rate of 0.20 ml min−1 with the following gradient programme: 0–2 min, 85% B; 2–14 min, linear decrease to 30% B; 14–15 min, isocratic at 30% B; 15–17.1 min, re-equilibration to 85% B; and 17.1–23 min, hold at 85% B.

Metabolite quantification was performed on a Vanquish Horizon UHPLC system coupled to an Orbitrap Exploris 120/240 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a heated electrospray ionization source. Ionization parameters were set to +3.5 kV for positive mode and −2.8 kV for negative mode, with an RF lens setting of 70, a heated capillary temperature of 320 °C and an auxiliary gas heater temperature of 280 °C. Sheath gas flow was set to 40, auxiliary gas to 15 and sweep gas was disabled. For MS1 acquisition, data were collected in full scan mode over a mass range of m/z = 70–900, using a standard automatic gain control target with an automatically determined maximum injection time. Data were acquired with polarity switching at an Orbitrap resolution of 120,000. Untargeted metabolite profiling was performed using the AcquireX Deep Scan workflow with iterative data-dependent acquisition on pooled samples. Full scans were acquired at a resolution of 60,000, with tandem mass spectrometry fragmentation at 30,000 resolution and a minimum intensity threshold of 5.0 × 103. Dynamic exclusion was triggered after a single event (10 s, ±5 ppm), and precursors were isolated with a 1.2 m/z window. Stepped higher-energy collisional dissociation energies of 30, 50 and 150 were applied, with mild trapping enabled to improve signal quality.

Metabolite identification was performed using Compound Discoverer (v.3.2; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Compounds were assigned based on precursor m/z values within 5 ppm of the theoretical mass, fragment ion matches within 5 ppm to an internal spectral library of authentic standards analysed under identical data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry conditions (minimum match score of ≥70), and retention times within 5% of those of purified standards under the same chromatographic conditions. Peak area integration and chromatogram evaluation were carried out in TraceFinder (v.5.1; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and isotopologue distributions were corrected for natural isotope abundance using the AccuCor package61.

Features were filtered using the 80% modified rule62, followed by exclusion of metabolites with a coefficient of variation of >30% in pooled quality control samples63. These filtering steps retain stable metabolites consistently detected in the samples, thereby preserving only robust and reproducible features. Intensities were normalized to the valine-d8 internal standard to correct for sample-to-sample technical variations, followed by LOESS signal correction to account for a systematic run order-dependent drift. Missing values were imputed with the group mean, while features entirely absent in a group were substituted with half of the minimum detected intensity in the dataset. Subsequently, data were log2-transformed to stabilize variance and improve normality before statistical analysis. Principal component analysis was performed using the prcomp function from the R stats package64, and Hotelling's T2 test was applied to identify sample outliers using the qcc package65. Sample group differential abundance was assessed using two-sided Student's t-tests, and P values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg method from the R base stats package. Finally, readxl66 and tidyverse were used for general scripting67.

RNA sequencing was performed by the CNIC Genomics Unit team. RNA libraries were produced using the Illumina TruSeq RNASeq kit and sequenced in an Illumina HiSeq 2500 Sequencer. Downstream analysis was performed using the nf-core/rnaseq analysis pipeline68 using Nextflow (v.24.10.5). In brief, following quality control with FastQC, adaptor sequences were removed using Trim Galore! The cleaned reads were then aligned to the Homo sapiens reference genome (GRCh38, Ensembl release 104) using the STAR aligner. Transcript-level abundances were quantified with Salmon, and gene-level read counts were generated using featureCounts. Raw counts were normalized using the variance stabilizing transformation function, and differential gene expression analysis was performed within the DESeq2 package69. P values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using clusterProfiler70 with statistics obtained from DESeq2. Transcription factor activity was inferred with decoupleR23 (univariate linear model), with DoRothEA regulons71. We filtered for regulons with a high level of confidence (‘A'). Generation of heatmaps and figures was done in R using the pheatmap package.

Data are presented as mean ± s.d. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 10. The statistical tests used, sample size and post hoc corrections are indicated in the figure legends. All statistical tests were two-tailed and had an alpha of 0.05 as the significance threshold. *P < 0.05. No data were excluded.

The spatial distribution of binders in Li-ion battery electrodes is critical to electrode performance, yet remains challenging to visualise, limiting binder optimisation efforts to chemical modifications rather than spatial control. Here, we show an accessible approach to staining carboxymethyl cellulose and styrene butadiene rubber binders in graphitic and Si-based Li-ion electrodes with silver and bromine, enabling detailed electron imaging and precise spectroscopic quantification of the binder domain. Leveraging these methods, we perform binder-informed optimisation of electrode manufacturing, achieving a 14% reduction in electronic resistivity, suppression of binder migration during high-temperature electrode drying, and a 40% decrease in electrode ionic resistance. Furthermore, staining enables electrode-scale, high-resolution backscattered electron imaging of complex binder hierarchies, revealing multiple types of agglomerates and elusive nanoscale binder films. These films completely coat graphitic surfaces in pristine electrodes but shatter into highly inhomogeneous fragments after calendering in both research-grade and commercial electrodes, presenting new perspectives on interpreting common cycling stability and electrode performance issues. We show how binder staining can advance fundamental understanding, quality control and manufacturing optimisation of Li-ion electrodes, particularly those based on widely used water-processable binders.

Polymeric binders are critical in providing mechanical stability to all Li-ion battery electrodes, but occupy less than 5% of the electrode volume1. It is well known that the spatial distribution of the binder within an electrode strongly influences the cohesion and adhesion of electrode coating, cycling stability2, electronic, ionic and thermal conductivity3,4,5,6 and, thus, the longevity, rate performance and cost of Li-ion batteries1,7. Particularly for Li-ion battery negative electrodes, however, mapping the small binder fractions remains highly challenging, impeding rational, binder-informed optimisation of electrode structure, performance and manufacturing. During electrode fabrication, for example, drying-induced binder migration can severely undermine subsequent electrode stability and rate performance8,9. To prevent this, industrial roll-to-roll manufacturing of Li-ion electrodes uses relatively slow drying in 30–100 m-long ovens that dominate the footprint of a coating line1,10,11 and require large capital investment (~105k euro/m of drying line, based on linear fitting of the published data10). As opposed to trial-and-error, efficient development of new drying approaches relies on accurate binder mapping techniques, as demonstrated in a number of studies8,9,12,13,14,15. Furthermore, among the many, often elaborate, techniques for decreasing tortuosity and increasing the power density of battery electrodes16,17,18,19, changing binder distribution at the electrode scale presents an attractive9, yet mostly unexplored alternative – because of the complex, hard-to-characterise nature of the binder domain. At a finer scale, the micro-distribution and coverage of binders on the active particle surfaces similarly remain challenging to determine6,20,21,22,23,24, leaving a significant gap in understanding the effects of binders on key surface processes, such as Li intercalation25 or formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)26,27,28,29.

Since the early 2000's, the water-soluble sodium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose (Na-CMC) blended with emulsified styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) has become the now-standard binder mixture used in industrial graphite and graphite/silicon negative electrodes30, and is also being explored for next-generation Si negative electrodes31 and water-processable LiFePO4 positive electrodes32,33. Being dispersible in water rather than toxic N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), these binders considerably lowered the cost and complexity of negative electrode manufacturing, and improved cycling stability of these electrodes1,34. Contrary to the previous-generation polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder, however, SBR and CMC lack distinct, covalently bound elements that are traceable by readily accessible methods such as energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) or backscattered electron imaging (BEI). Lacking a well-defined morphology, binders are also difficult to distinguish with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Thus, there are only a few convincing demonstrations of mapping SBR and CMC, using, for example, thermogravimetry15, Raman spectroscopy35 (both requiring unpractically thick or concentrated samples) or more sophisticated time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy36. Most recently, Lee et al. described staining of SBR with osmium tetroxide (OsO4) that could be detected by energy-selective backscattered electron imaging (EsB) or EDX spectroscopy to trace SBR migration in graphite electrodes during drying37,38. The extreme toxicity and volatility of OsO4, however, limit this approach to only the most specialised laboratories. Consequently, most of the works describing correlations between manufacturing conditions, electrochemical performance and binder distribution in graphite electrodes utilised EDX-traceable PVDF as a binder8,9,12,13,14, which has different mechanical properties, binding mechanism and can show exaggerated migration during drying compared with the commercially-used CMC/SBR binders15.

To circumvent these limits, here we describe two accessible binder staining methods that can be paired with EDX, BEI or EsB for rapid mapping and high-resolution imaging of aqueous binders in Li-ion battery electrodes. We demonstrate how these methods provide fundamental insights into binder organisation within the electrodes and enable binder-informed optimisation of Li-ion battery negative electrodes.

Our concept of binder staining relies on exposing electrode samples to chemical agents that attach to the functional groups present within the binders but not in the other electrode components, as shown schematically in Fig. 1. Immersing graphite electrodes in aqueous AgNO3 solution leads to Ag+ ions binding to the carboxyl groups in CMC, forming a water-insoluble complex depicted in Fig. 1a. On the other hand, exposing the electrodes to Br2 vapour brominates the aliphatic sp2 carbons of SBR, as depicted in Fig. 1b. The latter reaction is similar to OsO4 staining but with significantly lower hazard, as indicated by a 217-times higher short-term safe exposure limit for Br2 compared with OsO439. Thus, the reactions can be performed using simple equipment — a Schlenk line for bromination (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1), and a glass beaker and a vacuum desiccator for silverization (Fig. 1a). The mechanism of both reactions was confirmed using attenuated-total reflection infra-red spectroscopy (ATR-IR), X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and EDX, showing diminished aliphatic C=C peaks in brominated SBR, a strong shift of -COO- peaks in silverized CMC and a substitution of Ag for Na, as discussed in Supplementary Notes 1–2 and Supplementary Figs. 2–4. The high affinity of Ag+ for carboxylate groups is not limited to CMC — silverization was also successfully applied to carboxyl-rich sodium alginate and sodium polyacrylate — two other widely researched aquoeus binders with a superior performance in e.g. silicon negative electrodes31,34,40 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Note that because of the reactivity of Ag+(aq) and Br2, staining and binder mapping should be applied on separate electrode areas to those used in electrochemical or other testing.

The number of technical replicates (1.46 × 1.09 mm area measurements) was n = 5 for all the samples except for Br in 3% SBR (n = 7) and in 4% SBR (n = 9, excluding one outlier flagged in the Source Data). f EDX Br content in brominated electrodes during continuous irradiation with SEM/EDX electrons, normalised to the average Br content in the first 10 and 35 s of exposure for the 1–4% SBR and 0% SBR coatings, respectively. The number of technical replicates (152 × 114 μm area measurements) was n = 1 in all electrodes except for 0% SBR, where n = 4 for better signal-to-noise (individual and averaged measurements of this sample are shown as small and large blue points, respectively). g Normalised Br content at the end of measurements in f, averaged between 170 and 200 s (n = 34, 9, 9, 9, 8 for the 0-4% SBR samples, respectively).

The samples in c–e were silverized with the addition of a surfactant, as explained in “Methods”. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

To test the specificity of the staining reactions, we performed them on individual electrode components, i.e. dried films of CMC and SBR and powders of graphite and carbon conductive additive (C45). EDX and XPS were used to quantify Br and Ag concentration in the first 1 μm (EDX) and 10 nm (XPS) of the stained materials, showing a large amount of Ag in Ag-CMC and of Br in Br-SBR, and little to no binding of these elements to the other materials, as presented in Supplementary Fig. 3. Encouraged by these results, we used EDX to test the selectivity of staining on five electrode coatings containing graphite, 1 wt% C45 and 4% wt. (CMC + SBR) binder mixture with the relative CMC:SBR mass ratio ranging from 4:0 to 0:4. Each electrode coating was delaminated from the current collector, stained, and homogenised by pulverising in a mortar to remove any influence of binder migration on the quantification of staining efficiency. Figure 1c, d shows BEI of silverized and brominated electrode coatings with either only 4% CMC or 4% SBR, together with Ag and Br content quantified with EDX in all coatings in Fig. 1e. In the atomic number-sensitive BEI, the presence of Ag and Br strongly brightened contrast to the remaining materials containing mainly C, O and H. This allows clear identification of threads of Ag-CMC in the CMC-only electrode and patches of Br-SBR in the SBR-only electrode in Fig. 1c, d, respectively. Figure 1e shows that the amount of Ag in the silverized electrodes scaled linearly with the CMC content across all the CMC:SBR ratios. High selectivity of Ag to CMC over SBR was confirmed by the 16-times more Ag in the 4% CMC electrode compared to the minute Ag quantity in the 4 % SBR electrode. XPS analysis combined with detailed EDX mapping of non-homogenised electrodes presented in Supplementary Notes 2–3 and Supplementary Figs. 3–5 revealed that the small apparent reactivity of Ag to SBR was due to the reaction of Ag+ with leftover reagents used in the manufacturer's SBR emulsion-polymerisation, such as ionic surfactants, persulfates and thiols41,42, whose presence was indicated by Na, K and S found in the top of both SBR-only electrode and pure SBR sample. This analysis also showed that in non-homogenised electrodes, the negative impact of these reagents on the Ag-CMC staining selectivity may be larger in the top electrode region, where these compounds appeared to concentrate.

The amount of Br in the brominated samples also scaled linearly with the SBR content in the electrodes, with 7-times more Br in the 4% SBR electrode compared to the 4% CMC electrode (Fig. 1e). The small amount of Br binding to CMC was due to surface oxidation of Na-CMC by Br2 and binding of Br to Na (see exemplary Hunsdiecker reaction scheme in Fig. 1b)43. The associated formation of NaBr was suggested by the 1:1 elemental ratio of Br to Na detected by local EDX mapping inside the porous, high surface-area CMC/C45 agglomerates, as well as the mostly ionic (Br−) form of bromine detected with XPS in the top few nanometres of brominated CMC, as presented in Supplementary Notes 2,4 and Supplementary Figs. 3–4 and 6. The formation of NaBr on the CMC surface enabled BEI observation of CMC in brominated electrodes (Fig. 1d), similarly to Ag binding to CMC-COO− groups in silverized electrodes (Fig. 1c). The ionic binding of Br in brominated CMC was also stable under the SEM/EDX electron beam, contrary to the less stable Br bound to polymeric SBR, which progressively outgassed from the SBR-containing electrodes during continuous electron irradiation, as visible in time-resolved Br tracing in Fig. 1f. The extent of Br outgassing scaled linearly with SBR amount in the samples (Fig. 1g), suggesting it could be used to verify SBR quantification in brominated electrodes containing CMC — as we demonstrate below.

Having established the high specificity of the staining reactions, we tested their sensitivity to varying binder fraction within graphite electrodes, as presented in Fig. 2. This was verified using a model, ~300 μm-thick bi-layer electrode spray coated onto a Cu foil using a method reported in our previous work refs. 44,45,46. By consecutively spraying and instantly drying two slurries with relatively high and low binder concentration, we designed this electrode to have a 4-times difference in binder fraction between a lower, binder-rich layer (with 4.5% SBR and 3.0% CMC by weight) and an upper, binder-lean layer (with 1.13% SBR and 0.75% CMC), keeping the overall binder content within the typical range of Li-ion electrodes. After fabrication and calendering, electrode fragments were stained with either Br2 or Ag+, cross-sectioned using Ar plasma milling, and analysed using EDX and BEI. Note that before silverization, the Ag-treated electrodes were detached from the current collector to avoid reaction of Ag+ with the Cu foil current collector, as explained in “Methods”.

Each point and horizontal bar represents a single (n = 1) Δ from one scan or a pair of scans, respectively. The Δ's were calculated from mean signals in 110 μm (120 data points) of the binder-rich and lean layers. e Δ's derived using EDX, BEI and Br outgassing in all samples. For each staining type, n = 3 electrode samples were individually stained and measured with EDX and BEI. Weighted means (columns) were averaged from the individual measurements (points). The error bars correspond to Student's t-95% confidence intervals of derived Δ's (d) or averages of Δ's (e). All images were acquired at 10 kV and post-processed as described in “Methods”. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

The EDX maps of Ag-L and Br-L X-ray series presented in Fig. 2a show an expected bi-layer distribution of the staining elements, which is reflected in the derived through-thickness Ag and Br profiles in Fig. 2b. The profiles were individually ratioed and indicate 3.9 ± 1.8 (silverized) and 3.1 ± 0.4 (brominated) average element ratio Δ between the binder-rich and binder-lean layers, also summarised in Fig. 2e (note, ±corresponds to 95% confidence intervals). These average values are within 2.5% and 22% of the expected 4× ratio, with more undercounted Δ for the Br-stained SBR due to the larger susceptibility of SBR to drying-induced migration amplified by its weaker adsorption onto graphite47, as verified in Supplementary Note 5 and Supplementary Fig. 7. The element ratios in individual samples were also within 5–23% (silverized) and 4–6% (brominated) of the average values, indicating good precision in single 1 mm-wide cross-section measurements. The addition of a surfactant (1 mM Triton X-100) to the AgNO3 staining solution benefited wetting and accuracy of Ag-CMC profiling through the binder-lean region of the samples, as discussed in the wetting analysis in Supplementary Note 6 and Supplementary Fig. 8. The higher complexity of liquid-phase silverization and lower intrinsic Ag signal in Ag-CMC (as quantified in Fig. 1e) could also explain the larger spread of silverized Δ's compared to the brominated ones (Fig. 2e).

For the Br-SBR analysis, we verified its accuracy by following Br outgassing. This was done by subtracting Br-L traces derived from EDX maps acquired consecutively at increasing pixel dwell time (corresponding to the total mapping time and total electron dose). Fig. 2c shows that the differential (outgassed) Br-L profiles closely followed the absolute Br-L profiles, with a similar outgassing Δ of 3.5 ± 0.9× averaged across the three samples (Fig. 2e). Also, for the absolute EDX Ag-L and Br-L profiling, increasing mapping time did not significantly change the Δ values - accurate through-thickness binder profiling across these ~350 μm-thick electrodes could be performed as rapidly as 8 min for Br and 24 min for Ag (Fig. 2d). Although generation of higher quality EDX maps required at least 1 h (e.g. 3 h for the maps in Fig. 2a), the mapping time could be reduced to just a minute using BEI (Fig. 2a), due to much higher yield of backscattered electrons than electron-generated X-rays48. By analysing the distribution of white pixels in BEI images after multilevel Otsu thresholding49, they could also be used for quantitative binder profiling. Except for two silverized samples, the BEI-derived pixel profiles in Fig. 2b matched the EDX elemental profiles and gave similar Δ values. However, cross-sectional BEI remained more uncertain due to its sensitivity to image artefacts (e.g. particle surface charging) and trace metallic contamination after ion polishing, as shown in Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10.

Having established the staining methodology, we investigated detailed local binder organisation inside graphitic electrodes by combining staining with EsB. EsB is a low beam energy-variant of BEI that utilises a polarised filtering grid in front of an in-lens backscattered electron detector to capture backscattered electrons originating only from a shallow depth of the analysed surface, with high compositional resolution50,51,52. The method has been used previously for mapping the general distribution of PVDF and OsO4-stained SBR in graphite electrodes, but without focusing on local binder morphology37,52.

Figure 3 shows secondary electron and EsB images of the interior of an uncalendered standard graphite electrode (with 2.2 wt% SBR and 1.5 wt% CMC) after silverization. The images were acquired at low and high magnification (Fig. 3a, b, respectively) and gradually decreasing beam voltages, corresponding to decreasing electron-sample penetration depth and increasing surface sensitivity in consecutive images48. At 10 kV, the EsB images show bright, few micron-sized agglomerates of stained CMC and C45 conductive carbon nanoparticles, localised mostly between graphite particles (denoted as α phase in Fig. 3a, b). Containing a large number of C45 nanoparticles, these agglomerates influence long-range interparticle electronic conductivity within the electrode53 (also see the “Correlating slurry mixing, CBD agglomeration and the electrical resistivity of graphite electrodes” section below). The contrast from these agglomerates at 10 kV originated from a relatively bulky stained binder within their composite structure. Consequently, this contrast mostly disappeared at lower beam voltages of 2.5 and 2 kV (shown in Fig. 3a), where the depth probed by backscattered electrons was reduced from a few hundred to a few dozen nanometres (see the simulations in Fig. 3c). At these lower beam voltages, a second agglomerate type containing tightly packed, dark SBR nanoparticles mixed with CMC and C45 became visible (β morphology in Fig. 3a, b). The differentiation between C45, CMC and SBR was achieved by comparative analysis of electrodes prepared without SBR or C45, presented in Supplementary Fig. 11. Due to the large concentration of SBR in these agglomerates, they provide mechanical cohesion and elasticity to the electrode54,55,56. Finally, the EsB images acquired at even lower beam biases of 1.5 kV and 1 kV surprisingly revealed a third, continuous-layer morphology of binder (termed γ in Fig. 3a, b) that coated large regions of graphitic surfaces and was not visible at larger beam voltages. This binder layer was also not visible in control EsB images of a non-stained electrode or of a silverized CMC-free electrode, being only visible in the CMC-containing electrodes (Supplementary Fig. 12). These comparator experiments confirmed that bright EsB contrast at 1.5 and 1 kV in Fig. 3 unambigously corresponded to a continous thin film of silverized CMC that also embedded some non-stained (dark) SBR nanoparticles, visible in Fig. 3b. These observations were reproduced in several hundreds of EsB images acquired on four separately-made graphite electrodes after staining, some of them shown in Supplementary Fig. 13.

All the EsB images were acquired at an EsB filter grid voltage of −513 V. Therefore, the simulations in c only consider backscattered electrons with an exit energy larger than 513 eV. The electrodes contained 2.2 wt% SBR and 1.5 wt% CMC. Simulations were performed using the Casino package81. The description of electrode preparation and simulation procedure is provided in “Methods”. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Monte Carlo simulations were used to estimate the thickness of the CMC layer based on its changing visibility at different EsB imaging voltages, as described in “Methods”. Figure 3c shows the simulated depth of electron backscattering events in an Ag-CMC layer on a graphite particle at different electron beam energies. As an approximate detectability criterion, we assumed that the proportion of the electrons backscattered in the Ag-CMC layer to the electrons backscattered in the underlying graphite should be much larger than 0.5 at 1 keV and 1.5 keV for detection, and similar or lower than 0.5 at 2 keV and 2.5 keV for no detection. The plots of the cumulative distribution of backscattered electrons in Fig. 3c show that this condition was met for an Ag-CMC thickness of only 10-15 nm, which is in the same range as the thickness derived from high resolution SEM/EsB imaging of a fractured graphitic particle (Supplementary Fig. 14), as well as the assumed uniform binder layer thickness in graphitic electrodes calculated by Landesfeind et al.57. Because the CMC layer was so thin, it closely followed the morphology and contours of the underlaying graphite surfaces. This is why the layer could not be distinguished from bare graphite using conventional secondary electron microscopy (both in this and in previous works), even at very low beam voltages (Fig. 3b). Also note that in the ion-polished samples, the CMC layer was completely masked by trace metallic contaminants deposited on graphitic surfaces after the polishing (Supplementary Fig. 10). The thin layer could also be observed in EsB images of silverized electrodes with an analogous polyacrylate binder (Supplementary Fig. 15). Previous works have postulated that binders form nanoscale layers on active particle surfaces in Li-ion electrodes6,58,59,60,61, but the visual evidence for such binder morphology, until now, was limited to only a few higly localized spectroscopic transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies22,23,24.

The EsB images in Fig. 3a, b were acquired from an internal, delaminated region of an electrode where the bright CMC layer appeared as a patchy layer, allowing for differentiation from dark uncoated graphite surfaces. To assess if delamination might have affected the binder distribution, we also acquired images from the electrode top (not delaminated) surface (Fig. 4). The images of the silverized electrode in Fig. 4a show that the CMC layer completely coated graphite particle surfaces, with additional brighter patches of Ag bound to CMC or SBR emulsifiers that migrated to the surface during electrode drying. These EsB images also show additional dark areas that were not stained by Ag+ but produced charging in the secondary electron images (see the marked areas in Fig. 4a). As shown in Fig. 4b, on bromination, these areas appeared bright in the intially-acquired EsB images and rapidly faded in subsequent images. Recalling the electron-induced outgassing of Br from Br-SBR, this allowed indentifying these patches as SBR. Additionally, high magnification images show that they consisted of self-assembled individual SBR nanoparticles (the same, less agglomerated SBR particles were also visible in the CMC layer in Fig. 3b). That SBR retains nanoparticle form in the electrode results from the mild mixing conditions required during slurry preparation to prevent SBR demulsification62. The island-like agglomeration of SBR compared to the uniform layer appearance of CMC also evidences their different affinity to graphite surfaces47. Furthermore, Br outgassing from the “free” (not agglomerated with CMC) brominated SBR nanoparticles differentiates them from the superficially brominated CMC layer, whose EsB contrast remained unchanged during consecutive image acquisitions (see the images of an internal part of the brominated electrode in Supplementary Fig. 16). The outgassing of Br-SBR also allowed for quantification of SBR particle coverage by subtracting a later-acquired EsB image from the first EsB image (see Methods). We estimate that the ~120 nm thick SBR agglomerates covered 8–9% of the apparent graphite surface area on top and within this electrode, with an additional 6% of the internal electrode surfaces covered by the SBR/CMC agglomerates. The similarity of binder morphologies detected with EsB inside silverized (Fig. 3) and brominated (Supplementary Fig. 16) electrodes also suggested that the binder distribution itself was not affected by the staining procedures.

During the manufacturing of Li-ion electrodes, slurry coating and drying are followed by compressing (calendering) the electrodes between two metal rolls. Calendering reduces inter-particle porosity and often improves electrode electrical conductivity63, but its effect on binder distribution is largely unknown. Thus, we analysed binder surface coverage after hot calendering the electrode to 30% porosity at 80 °C. The EsB images from the top and interior of the calendered electrode in Fig. 4c show fracture and delamination of both the γ binder film and β SBR/CMC/C45 agglomerates. Fracture resulted in large, irregularly distributed areas of graphite particles where the previously near-complete CMC layer was shattered and partially delaminated. The remaining CMC patches covered only 32 ± 5% of the particle surface, based on gaussian filtering and grey-level thresholding of five EsB images (Fig. 4e). On the top electrode surface directly exposed to the hot calender rollers, CMC coverage was even lower (21 ± 3%, also visible in Fig. 4c). The shattering of the CMC layer was consistent with the reported brittleness of dried CMC64. These findings are not limited to laboratory-made electrodes—we also imaged uncycled commercial electrodes from LiFUN Technology (Xinma Industry Zone, Hunan Province, China). Figure 4d shows identical shattered CMC layers and SBR agglomerates in these electrodes, with over 60% of graphitic surfaces left bare and uncoated (Fig. 4e). Such high inhomogeneity in binder surface coverage can be expected to strongly affect surface processes on active material particles, such as Li+ (de)intercalation or formation of SEI, as explained in detail later.

To demonstrate how binder mapping can benefit the development of Li-ion electrodes, we carried out two practical studies. First, we investigated the relationship between the conditions of slurry processing, the distribution of conductive carbon/binder domain (CBD) within the electrodes, and electrode electrical resistivity (Fig. 5). In the graphite electrodes prepared using our standard slurry mixing protocol shown in Fig. 5a, large CBD clusters could be readily detected after bromination or silverization with BEI (Fig. 5b) and EsB at 10 kV (Fig. 4a). Although the spatial density of these clusters was moderate (8.5 cluster per mm2), they had a large geometric area of more than 100 μm2/cluster, shown in the associated histogram in Fig. 5c. This implied that a fraction of binder-embedded C45 conductive carbon particles was ineffectively and inhomogeneously distributed across the electrode. To reduce CBD agglomeration, we fabricated electrodes of the same dry mass composition, but using a more concentrated CMC solution (increased from 1.5 to 3 wt%) during an initial mixing step. After subsequent mixing with graphite, the slurry was diluted with water to the same final water fraction as in the standard slurry, as shown in Fig. 5a. We hypothesized that because the amphiphilic CMC electrostatically stabilizes solids dispersion in the slurry by adsorbing onto the graphite and carbon particle surfaces47, a more concentrated CMC solution in the first mixing step might increase CMC saturation on C45 surfaces, improving C45 dispersion in the slurry and in the final electrode. Figure 5b shows a BEI image of such a modified electrode after bromination, confirming the disappearance of large CBD clusters, which is also evident in the histogram in Fig. 5c. Interestingly, such a level of CBD de-agglomeration could not be achieved using zirconia balls during mixing of the standard 1.5 wt. % CMC slurry, indicating a stronger influence of the initial CMC concentration on the CBD dispersion (Supplementary Fig. 17). Recently, Park et al. similarly found that increasing the initial CMC concentration during mixing with carbon black particles improved their dispersion in wet slurries65. Furthermore, four-point probe measurements of not-stained samples showed that reduced CBD agglomeration decreased mean electronic resistivity in both uncalendared and calendered electrode coatings by 14 ± 2% (Fig. 5d), albeit with a somewhat larger uncertainty after calendering. While the absolute electronic resistivity of both electrode coatings was low ( ~ 0.1 Ω × cm) due to the omnipresence of electronically conductive graphite, these findings could help to optimise other electrodes based on more resistive active materials, e.g. LiFePO4 or sulfur, and similar binder/carbon additives. Future staining-assisted optimisation could investigate alternative pre-mixing methods of thinner, lower CMC-content slurries, or substituting C45 nanoparticles with carbon nanotubes or graphene for further resistivity decrease6.

Five (uncalendared) and eight (calendared) samples of each coating were measured ten times each. Sample properties are summarised in Supplementary Table 1. BEI image segmentation and CBD clustering analysis were done as described in “Methods”. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

In the second application of binder staining, we explored phase inversion as a method to prevent binder migration during fast, high-temperature electrode drying (Fig. 6). Phase inversion is a roll-to-roll compatible process, where a polymer solution (e.g. PVDF in NMP) is immersed in a non-solvent (e.g. water) that destabilises the solution and causes rapid precipitation of the polymer, as schematically shown in Fig. 6a66. Several studies demonstrated that this process can improve manufacturability and cycling performance of >100 μm thick PVDF- and poly(ether sulfone)-based battery electrodes, partly due to induced directional porosity or altered PVDF morphology67,68,69. However, the effect of precipitating binders before electrode drying on final binder distribution has been difficult to assess. Therefore, we first screened 17 potential non-solvents and found that acetone and isopropanol rapidly precipitated CMC from aqueous solution, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 18. Then, we applied phase inversion to freshly-coated, wet graphite electrodes by dipping them for 3 min in isopropanol or acetone before drying at 120 °C and calendering at 80 °C, and compared them with a reference electrode processed identically but without phase inversion. Following staining of the binders, the EDX maps and binder profiles in Fig. 6b, c show that high-rate drying increased the CMC and SBR fraction at the top of the reference electrode. Blocking of the top surface pores with excessive binder obstructs the Li+ access to the electrode volume and leaves less binder at the interface with the current collector, lowering electrode adhesion9. Nonetheless, the migration was not as severe as in PVDF-based electrodes, in agreement with the recent results of Lee et al.37. Figure 6b shows that immersion in isopropanol further concentrated the binders at the top electrode surface by forming a dense polymer “skin layer”, likely associated with a relatively slow isopropanol permeation and delayed precipitation of the binder66,67. On the other hand, the electrode immersed in acetone showed a marked binder concentration near the current collector, possibly due to faster precipitation of CMC by acetone with 6× lower viscosity than isopropanol70. The greater binder fraction at the current collector allowed to extensively bend this relatively thick electrode without cracking, making it significantly more adherent to the current collector compared with the two other electrodes with the opposite binder distribution, as tested on not-stained samples (Fig. 6d). The EDX results were reproducible on separately made, processed and stained electrodes (Supplementary Fig. 19).

For both the reference and acetone-processed electrode, 3 symmetric cells (each made of two independently-calendered 2.01 cm2-sized electrode fragments cut from a 100 cm2 parent electrode) were measured 3 times each (n = 9), and the results were averaged. The average thickness (d) and porosity (ε) were identical for both types of electrodes and are indicated in f. The error bars and ±values correspond to 95% confidence intervals of the averages. Source raw and processed data are provided as a Source Data file.

To explore effects on pore ionic resistance, we tested unstained samples using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a non-intercalating electrolyte developed by Landesfeind et al. 3,57. Figure 6e shows the Nyquist plots of the reference and acetone-processed electrode in which the pore resistance was derived by extrapolating the low-frequency, near-linear regions of the plots4. Figure 6f shows that the measured ionic resistance was 40% lower for the acetone-processed electrode compared to the reference electrode, with the actual resistance difference possibly even larger71, as discussed in ""Methods"". The process did not change the comparatively low electronic contact resistance of the coatings, indicated by the absence of a high-frequency semicircle in the Nyquist plots3,72 (highlighted in Supplementary Fig. 20). Considering that all electrodes had identical composition, thickness and total porosity, the marked reduction in ionic resistance was a sole consequence of the preferential binder (and porosity) distribution, in agreement with simulations9,73. As demonstrated by Morasch et al. on a high-temperature-dried, mechanically delaminated and upturned electrode with a similar final binder distribution, reduced pore resistance leads to significant improvements in electrode fast charging and discharging performance9, and likely extends electrode lifetime74,75. Our results show that the same preferential binder distribution and reduced ionic resistance could be realised with a much more practical and potentially up-scalable phase inversion, which simultaneously enables rapid electrode drying. Combining phase inversion with using spherical (instead of flaky) graphite or pore patterning techniques could further improve ionic transport in such electrodes5,16,17,18,19.

Finally, we outline the present limitations of this study. First, the staining methods, particularly the liquid-phase silverization, are less applicable to electrodes containing easily-oxidizable materials (e.g. metallic, LiFePO4 or nano-Si particles), as these can rapidly undergo redox reactions with the staining elements, complicating image interpretation. Micro-Si or materials with an inert, stable surface passivation layer can be, however, suitable. This is shown in Fig. 7, which demonstrates successful staining on Si and C-coated SiOx microparticle-based electrodes but not on the more reactive LiFePO4 or nano-Si. For the same reason, silverization requires impractical detachment of any Cu current collector prior to staining, and the likely alteration of the electrode's electrochemistry by Ag+ and Br2 staining may restrict its applications, for example, in operando studies or online manufacturing quality control. Also, despite the time- and accessibility advantages of BEI, this imaging mode has a limited applicability for mapping Ag/Br-stained electrodes containing other high-Z elements (e.g. Si) where the use of EDX may be necessary (see BEI vs EDX in Fig. 7c). The same limit applies to EsB, where the contrast remains largely relative, highly sensitive to surface contamination, and requires calibration (as demonstrated herein)50. Furthermore, to minimise geometrical artefacts, the cross-sectional binder analysis requires lengthy sample plasma cross-sectioning (~8–12 h for 100 μm-thick electrodes), which might be shortened using laser pre-cutting or resin impregnation and microtomy. Also, because Ag+/Br2 staining targets carboxylate and aliphatic C=C groups in the binders, processes that alter these groups beforehand (e.g. drying-induced cross-linking) may reduce Ag/Br uptake (which, however, could be exploited to quantify binder cross-linking). Consequently, bromination and silverization are not suitable for staining e.g. PVDF or PTFE binders (that lack these functional groups), but can be suitable for other binders, such as the carboxyl-rich alginates and polyacrylates (as shown in Supplementary Fig. 15). However, the accuracy of spatial mapping of these two binders in electrodes remains to be fully quantified.

Due to the large S/V, the reactivity of nano-Si with Ag+ will impede staining selectivity towards CMC. c Top down secondary electron (SE), BEI, EDX and high magnification EsB images of internal surfaces of silverized micro-Si and C/SiOx electrodes containing 20 wt% graphite, 2.3% SBR, 1.5% CMC and 1% C45. The EDX maps show that Ag was bound and accurately found in CBD carbon-binder clusters (highlighted in the SE insets). The EsB images show good contrast of the CMC nanolayer on C/SiOx, but poor contrast on Si (see CMC on graphite particles as internal contrast standard). d EsB images of brominated micro-Si and C/SiOx electrodes with the same composition as in c, together with colourised differential Br outgassing maps of SBR processed using the code in Supplementary Note 7. e EsB images of silverized and brominated LiFePO4 electrodes with 1.5 wt% CMC and 2.3 wt% SBR. During silverization, Fe2+ reduced Ag+, forming large Ag dendrites. Bromination resulted in the formation of LiBr that deliquesced in air, forming liquid droplets visible in the inset photograph. Both reactions obscure the binders' detection in the LiFePO4-based electrodes. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

We have developed simple staining methods for mapping common aqueous binders — CMC and SBR — in graphitic Li-ion electrodes and showed how they enable better fundamental understanding and optimisation of these electrodes. On exposing electrodes to aqueous Ag+ or gaseous Br2, these elements bind to CMC and SBR, respectively, and act as markers for binder mapping using EDX (longer, but more accurate) and BEI (rapid, but less accurate), as verified on model bi-layered electrodes. Because Br binds to both SBR and (superficially) to CMC, bromination could be used for simultaneous BEI imaging of both of the binders, and the outgassing of Br from SBR in consecutively-acquired images allows for its distinction from CMC. The methods are compatible with micro-Si and SiOx-based electrodes, as well as analogous unsaturated and carboxylated binders, such as alginates and polyacrylates. We have shown that simple processing interventions and seemingly small differences in binder distribution can profoundly impact key metrics of the otherwise identical electrodes, improving their mechanical toughness or electronic and ionic conductivity. Staining combined with BEI, in particular, is simple and attractive for binder-informed optimisation and off-line quality control of electrodes in industrial settings, considering the availability of BEI even in table-top SEMs. The cost of implementing these methods comprises capital and operational costs of EDX/BEI-equipped SEM, while the staining itself utilises simple equipment and very small quantities of relatively cheap and reusable chemicals (here, 0.3 g AgNO3 or 0.6 g Br2 per batch of up to 5 samples). With optimisation of sample-cross sectioning, the complete staining, polishing and through-thickness EDX analysis time may be reduced from 15 to 5 h/sample and down to 3 h/sample for BEI analysis. Note that the staining and analysis, not requiring cross-sectioning, such as top-down CBD agglomeration check with BEI, can already be performed in less than 1 h/sample.

Combined with EsB, the staining methods enabled large-scale observation of surprisingly complex morphologies of CMC and SBR in laboratory-made and commercial graphitic Li-ion electrodes. The access to electrode-scale, high-resolution imaging of nanoparticulate SBR agglomerates and nano-thick CMC conformal films on graphitic particles opens new avenues for engineering active surfaces to enhance cyclability and stability of Li-ion battery negative electrodes. During galvanostatic Li intercalation, for example, we expect that the inhomogeneously-distributed surface patches of ionically resistive CMC76 and, in particular, thicker SBR can decrease electrochemically active surface area and cycling rate performance of graphite, also increasing local current density and local overpotential, which, in turn, could accelerate onset of localized Li metal plating and subsequent capacity drop (or failure) of the battery74. This could explain why excess SBR in graphitic electrodes correlates with increased internal cell resistance, lower SEI uniformity, accelerated Li plating and degrading cell capacity, as reported recently55. In this context, the effect of leftover SBR polymerisation agents, uncovered here, on the cyclability of the electrodes also remains an unexplored area. On the other hand, because carboxyl-rich binders (such as CMC) stabilise the SEI layer on graphite surfaces22,24,27, devising ways to maximise CMC coverage may also benefit cycling stability of graphitic and, in particular, volume-changing silicon electrodes2,31,64. The demonstrated effect of calendering on reducing CMC surface film coverage from ~90% in pristine graphite electrodes to 21% on top- and 32% within calendered electrodes also prompts reassessing how calendering conditions affect electrochemical stability and performance of graphite-based electrodes. Considering the SEI-stabilising role of CMC, for example, the lower CMC coverage at the top electrode surface after calendering can contribute to the increased SEI growth and blocking of pores in this electrode region74, and can partially explain why Li plating starts at the top of graphite-based electrodes, even at mild cycling conditions27,74,75. Therefore, the rich information provided by binder staining can shed new light on fundamental electrode processes and extend optimisation routes of Li-ion battery negative electrodes.

The uncertainty (±) of values reported in this work corresponds to their expanded 95% confidence intervals estimated with the Taylor Series Method or the Monte Carlo method, considering both random and systematic uncertainties of the values.

Artificial graphite (BTR S360-E3, flakes, nominal D50 = 16 μm), sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (degree of substitution = 0.8–0.95, Ashland), SBR (40% wt. suspension in water), carbon conductive additive (C-NERGYTM SUPER C45, Imersys), bromine liquid (99.8%, Alfa Aesar), silver nitrate (99.9999% trace metal basis, Sigma Aldrich), silicon powders (325 mesh: 99% trace metal basis, Sigma Aldrich and <50 nm: 98%, Alfa Aesar), C/SiOx powder (High Capacity Silicon Based Anode Powder, MSE Supplies), ethylene carbonate (≥ 99%, acid < 10 ppm, H2O < 10 ppm, Sigma Aldrich) and dimethyl carbonate (anhydrous, ≥99%, Sigma Aldrich) were used as received. The as-received tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (for EC analysis, ≥99.0%, Merck-Supelco) was dried in a vacuum over silica gel at room temperature for 3 days prior to bringing it into an Ar-filled glovebox to prepare the non-intercalating electrolyte for the EIS analysis. The water used for the preparation of aqueous solutions and electrode slurries was type II deionised water (0.5 μS/cm, TOC < 50 ppb). The battery-grade SBR was of a popular brand with known application in industrial Li-ion battery manufacturing, whose name is not disclosed for confidentiality.

Typical graphite electrodes were prepared from liquid slurries mixed using an Interionics Thinky ARE-250 planetary mixer in 35 mL polypropylene pots. First, 6 g of 1.5% wt. aqueous Na-CMC was mixed with 60 mg of C45 powder at 500 rpm for 1 min and 2000 rpm for 10 min. Then, 5.71 g of graphite powder was added and mixed at 500 rpm for 1 min and 2000 rpm for 10 min, followed by degassing at 2200 rpm for 3 min. Note that in the CBD agglomeration study (in “Correlating slurry mixing, CBD agglomeration and the electrical resistivity of graphite electrodes”), the graphite mixing was divided into two 5 min intervals with an additional 1 min 500 rpm mixing step in between, for full comparability with the modified procedure described in the same section. Finally, 0.33 g of 40% wt. aqueous SBR suspension was added and mixed at 500 rpm for 5 min. The as-obtained slurry with a total solid mass content of 49.3% was then blade-casted onto 10 μm-thick, isopropanol-wiped and dried Cu foil, using a digital adjustable applicator (QC Laboratory Equipment Ltd.), and dried in a fan convection oven for 30 min at 50 °C. The typical electrodes had a dry mass composition of 95.21 ± 0.06 wt% graphite, 2.22 ± 0.02 wt% SBR, 1.51 ± 0.01 wt% CMC and 1.05 ± 0.06 wt% C45, based on the weight of the materials used in 10 separately-made slurries. The electrodes were then cut into 20 mm-wide rectangular stripes and calendered using Sumet CA3 hot calender (150 mm drums width) operating at 80 °C, 0.2 m/min pass speed and 35 N/mm set force (corresponding to 263 N/mm of force normalised to the sample width), to produce 30% porous electrodes (standard deviation = 1%, n = 28).

The electrodes were brominated after vacuum-drying by exposing them to vapours of Br2 in an air-free setup depicted in Supplementary Fig. 1. The reaction was carried out inside a small glass reactor at 50 oC and Br2 pressure of 5–8 × 10−2 mbar for 270 s, followed by outgassing of excess Br2 under active vacuum (~2 × 10−2 mbar). The temperature and time were chosen to ensure no condensation of Br2 vapours inside the reactor and to facilitate complete reaction with SBR while minimising the processing time. Br2 vapours were provided by the small Br2 pool placed in a separate glass vial immersed in a small water bath (~20 °C) and connected to the pre-evacuated and heated reactor (~2 × 10−2 mbar, 50 °C) under static vacuum. The bromination conditions were applied without any further optimisation. After bromination, the initial samples were kept in a N2-sealed vessel until EDX/BEI analysis to avoid humidity-induced hydrolysis of brominated SBR; however, our later EDX tests also indicated no significant loss of Br from the electrodes in air for at least two weeks prior to the EDX/BEI analysis.

The electrodes were silverized by immersing them in a crystallizer containing 0.5 M AgNO3 for 3 min (depicted in Fig. 1a). For the CMC analysis of homogenized and bi-layered electrodes (in “Mechanism and specificity of staining reactions and Staining bi-layered electrodes”, respectively), the 0.5 M AgNO3 solution was freshly mixed with 1 mM Triton X-100 non-ionic surfactant prior to staining to help with penetration of the solution into all of the electrode, as discussed in detail in Supplementary Note 6 and Supplementary Fig. 8. During all silverizations, the crystallizer with AgNO3-soaked electrodes was briefly placed in a desiccator under mild vacuum to facilitate penetration of AgNO3 solution within the electrodes. After that time, the electrodes were taken out of the solution, washed with copious water and dried. Following silverization of the initial samples, there were visual signs of corrosion of the Cu foil and micron-sized Ag particles in random areas in the SEM images of the samples. This points to galvanic replacement of Ag+(aq) with Cu, according to Eq. (1):

To prevent it, prior to staining further electrodes, they were first carefully delaminated and transferred from the Cu foil support onto adhesive carbon SEM discs supported on a polypropylene film that was inert to Ag staining.

Secondary electron microscopy, BEI and EDX spectroscopy were performed using Zeiss Merlin field-emission SEM paired with Oxford Instruments (OI) XMax 150 mm2 and windowless XMax 80 mm2 EDX detectors operating in double detector mode, as well as Hitachi TM3030 table-top SEM paired with OI 30 mm2 EDX detector equipped with SATW polymer window (used for BEI in “Correlating slurry mixing, CBD agglomeration and the electrical resistivity of graphite electrodes” and for the EDX analysis of stained individual electrode components, presented in Supplementary Information). Typical EDX acquisitions were performed at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV and a spectral resolution of 5 eV/channel using TruMap mode, following energy-calibration against a 99.9% pure Cu standard. Elemental quantification was performed using factory standards provided in the OI Aztec software version 6.1. Systematic uncertainty of the EDX quantification was verified using freshly cleaned Ag wire and dried C-coated KBr pellet with 99.9% and ≥99% trace metal-basis purity, respectively, giving 1.3 ± 1.0% and 3.2 ± 1.5% relative bias for Ag and Br quantification, respectively. Considering ~4% uncertainty due to the roughness/porosity of the graphitic samples48, we estimate the relative combined systematic uncertainty of Ag and Br quantification at the applied conditions and 95% confidence level as ±8.4% and ±10.4%, respectively. All EsB images were acquired at a filtering grid voltage of −513  V.

Attenuated total reflection infra-red spectroscopy (ATR-IR) was performed using a Varian Excalibur FTS 3500 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a DTGS detector and Specac Golden Gate ATR accessory (monolithic diamond window, single bounce, 45° incidence angle, KRS-5 lenses) operating in air. For each sample, the background-corrected spectra were averaged from 256 scans acquired at 2.5 kHz speed and 4 cm−1 resolution.

XPS was performed using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer using a monochromatized Al K-alpha X-ray beam with an energy of 1486.7 eV and a voltage of 12 kV. For survey scans, a pass energy of 200 eV and a step size of 1 eV were used. For narrow scans, a pass energy of 50 eV and a step size of 0.1 eV were used. The binding energy of the spectra was corrected using the fitted saturated C-H peak at 285.0 eV. Spectra processing was done using CasaXPS 2.3.2777.

Electrical resistivity of electrode coatings was measured using an Ossila four-point probe system equipped with spring-loaded soft contact cylindrical golden probes with 0.48 mm diameter and 1.27 mm spacing. Because the technique requires samples to be supported by non-conductive substrates, to measure uncalendared coatings, they were slurry-casted on polypropylene sheets and cut into 30×30 mm samples after drying. To measure calendered coatings, coatings were first fabricated on Cu foils and calendered to 228 μm thickness and 32% porosity at 80 °C, delaminated from Cu foils, cut to 25 × 25 mm squares and measured on top of a glass substrate. Each sample was measured 10 times, rotating it by 90° between the measurements, and the results were averaged and normalised to sample thickness (the measurements are summarised in Supplementary Table 1).

To determine the pore ionic resistivity, the electrodes were first cut into 16 mm-diameter discs and dried under active vacuum at 120 °C overnight. After drying, the electrodes were brought to an Ar-filled glovebox (H2O and O2 level below 10 ppm) without breaking the vacuum and assembled in symmetric 2-electrode cells using EL-CELL PAT-Cell test cells equipped with a 260 μm-thick, 91% porous Whatman GF/A glass fibre separator. The electrolyte was 100–140 μL of 10 mM tetrabutylammonium perchlorate in 1:1 wt. ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate. Care was taken to maximise the alignment of the top electrode directly above the bottom electrode by using a vacuum pen. EIS was performed using a Biologic SP-150 potentiostat in an air-conditioned room maintained at 21 ± 1 °C. The measurements were done at the DC potential equalling the open circuit potential of each cell, in the 100 kHz–10 mHz frequency range, using an AC potential amplitude of 15 mV, averaging five measures per frequency and performing three full frequency scans for each cell (with a resting period of 2 h in between the measurements). Before the first measurement, the cells were allowed to equilibrate at the open circuit potential for 8 h. The electrodes had an average loading of 14 ± 1 mg/cm2 and 30 ± 3% porosity. Note that most recently, Bieneck et al. showed that the pore ionic resistance determined with symmetric-cell EIS can be strongly influenced by the spatial distribution of the double layer capacitance (Cdl) of carbon black, and its contribution to the overall Cdl of the electrode71. Based on the mass composition of our electrodes and the BET surface area of the graphite and C45 carbon black (1.47 and 45 m2/g, respectively), the estimated contribution of C45 to the total Cdl of the electrodes was ~25%. The analysis of Figure 9 in Bieneck's paper shows that for such Cdl contribution, the pore ionic resistance of the reference electrode (with CBD concentrated close to the separator) determined with EIS may be underestimated by ~12% and that of the acetone-processed electrode (with CBD concentrated close to the current collector) may be overestimated by ~23%, implying that the actual pore ionic resistance difference between these electrodes may be ~57% instead of the apparent 40%.

All the EDX maps and derived elemental profiles were acquired and processed using Oxford Instruments Aztec 6.1 SP2 software, using signal filtering at 99% or 95% confidence threshold. The combined EDX maps in Figs. 2 and 6 were prepared by binning Ag-L and Br-L elemental maps with a factor of 2, followed by clipping 5% of the high intensity pixels and stacking with C and Cu maps using weighting settings of 1.0 (Ag or Br) and 0.4 (C and Cu) for an optimum visibility of the staining elements against the sample matrix. Note that the maps of silverized samples did not include Cu, as these samples were detached from the Cu foil prior to staining and analysis. All the EDX Br-L and Ag-L line profiles were checked for EDX geometrical artefacts by following the reference C-K signals, which should not show a significant gradient through the thickness of electrode coatings. In one sample (silverized reference electrode in the phase inversion study), a 35% positive linear gradient was present in the C-K signal from the bottom to the top of the coating. Hence, the Ag-L signal was corrected by subtracting this gradient using Eq. (2):

where y and ycorr is the raw and corrected Ag-L signal, respectively, x is the distance (in μm), a is the linear regression slope (gradient) of the C-K signal vs x, fitted between x0 = 50 μm and \({x}_{{{{\rm{end}}}}}\) = 137 μm (the part of the EDX scan corresponding to the electrode coating), and S is the scaling factor (the ratio of the integrated Ag-L to integrated C-K signals).

To derive the vertical distribution of binders from BEI images, the images were segmented using the Multi Otsu Threshold plugin78 in the Fiji 2.14.079 package. Most of the images were segmented using three levels corresponding to the bright stained binder phase, grey graphite phase and black interparticle pore phase. In a few images with visible strong charging artefacts at the graphite particle edges, the number of levels was set to 4 to account for these artefacts, giving a smaller error in the binder phase detection.

To quantify CBD agglomerate size distribution from the BEI images in the “Correlating slurry mixing, CBD agglomeration and the electrical resistivity of graphite electrodes”, the images were first processed using Smart Blur (setting 50) in CorelDRAW 2021. Then, they were thresholded in Fiji using Sauvola local threshold (radius = 100, parameter 1 = 0.2, parameter 2 = 7) followed by the particle size analysis using Fiji's default “Analyze Particles” function, considering agglomerates with at least 1 μm2 surface area.

For quantification of CMC surface coverage from EsB images of silverized electrodes, for the images with high EsB noise, they were first de-noised using the default Fiji smooth filter. This was followed by selectively removing dark interparticle pores from the analysis area using Phansalkar's local threshold algorithm (radius 100, parameter 1 = 0.7, parameter 2 = 0). This was followed by applying several local and general threshold algorithms (e.g. Bernsen, Niblack, Moments, Huang) on copies of the image and averaging the results. For quantification of SBR coverage from EsB images of brominated electrodes, two EsB images acquired at the first and 3rd–5th scan (before and after Br outgassing, respectively) were first registered using the affine SIFT algorithm80, cropped on edges, and denoised using median and non-local means filter (sigma = 5, smoothing factor = 1). The Yen threshold was applied on the nth EsB image to quantify SBR/CMC agglomerates, which were subsequently removed from the region of interest in the 1st EsB image. Phansalkar's local threshold was used to remove dark interparticle pores, followed by subtracting the nth image from the 1st image and applying Otsu or Yen threshold to quantify the surface SBR agglomerate areas. The macro used for quantification is presented in Supplementary Note 7.

Monte Carlo simulations were performed using Casino 3.3.0.4 software81 for a layer of Ag-CMC on a graphite substrate, using ELSEPA scattering cross-sections82 and a modified Bethe equation by Joy and Luo for calculating stopping power83. The simulations were performed using 106 electrons formed into a beam of 5 nm diameter and a Gaussian profile (1.65 nm2 variance), at primary electron energies of 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 10 keV and a lower energy cutoff of 513 eV to reflect the EsB filter grid voltage of -513 V used in the experiments. The thickness of the Ag-CMC layer was varied between 1 and 20 nm, and the thickness of the graphite substrate was set at 1 μm (for 1–2.5 keV simulations) or 10 μm (for the 10 keV simulation). The stoichiometry of Ag-CMC used in the simulation was Ag802C7617O6615H10824, which corresponds to a Na-CMC chain with 102 glucopyranose units and a degree of substitution of 0.82, where all the Na bound to carboxylate groups was substituted with Ag (this stoichiometry was also found to have a similar atomic composition as the one determined with EDX on silverized CMC). The Ag-CMC density was set at 1.96 g/cm3, based on the average reported true density of Na-CMC of 1.5 g/cm3 and assuming the same molar volume of Ag-CMC as Na-CMC. The cumulative distributions of maximum penetration depth of backscattered electrons were calculated based on all the simulated electrons, while 104 electrons were considered for plotting backscattered electron trajectories. These trajectories were extracted from the simulation data files into.csv files using a Python code generated with OpenAI ChatGPT-484 and verified by the first author for accuracy. The code is provided in Supplementary Note 8.

This work used OpenAI ChatGPT-484 to assist in creating a Python code to extract electron trajectories from the Monte Carlo simulation output files generated by the Casino 3.3 Monte Carlo package81. The code was verified by the first author for accuracy and is provided as Supplementary Note 8.

Some sex differences in brain-connectivity patterns become more pronounced with age, according to new research.

Researchers studying brain-imaging data from people aged between 8 and 100 found that sex differences in the brain's connections are minimal in early life, but then increase drastically at puberty; some of these differences continue to grow throughout adult life. The study was published as a preprint on bioRxiv1, and has not yet been peer reviewed.

The work could help us to understand why men and women have different likelihoods of developing some mental-health disorders — and perhaps give insight into treating them, say the researchers. For example, women are about twice as likely as men to develop anxiety or depression2, and boys are about four times more likely to be diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder than girls3.

“We are very excited about this study, which to our knowledge is the first one to compare how sex differences in brain networks evolve over the lifespan,” says Amy Kuceyeski, a computational neuroimager at Weill Cornell Medicine in Ithaca, New York.

However, some neuroscientists who spoke to Nature aren't convinced that the differences found between male and female brains are due to sex, and say the study does not address differences in gender roles, which are known to be important factors when researching brain mechanisms of health and disease.

Human brains do not belong in distinct ‘female' and ‘male' categories, says Daphna Joel, a neuroscientist at the University of Tel Aviv in Israel, referring to a 2015 study she co-authored, which suggests that each human brain is a mosaic of features, some of which are more common in men, others in women4.

In their study, Kuceyeski and her colleagues set out to investigate sex-linked variation in brain development by analysing functional magnetic resonance imaging brain data from 1,286 people, half of whom were male and half female. The scans captured a snapshot of each individual's brain age, but did not follow the same people throughout their lives. The analysis was based on sex at birth because the researchers didn't have data on the participants' gender identities.

They used an artificial-intelligence tool they call Krakencoder to identify sex-linked differences in brain networks. The tool analysed structural connections — physical axonal links between brain regions — and functional connections, which included synchronized brain activity between brain regions.

Their analysis revealed sex-linked differences in both structural and functional pathways in the brain. Functional differences were mainly in higher-order brain networks, which use information from many brain regions to support attention, decision-making and consciousness. Structural differences peaked in midlife and continued to diverge with age, particularly in lower-order networks, which process information gleaned by the senses.

Throughout life, female participants tended to have stronger functional connections than did male participants between ‘default mode network' regions, which deal with higher-order processes. And as men got older, their functional connections between the two hemispheres of the cerebellum, used in motor control, grew increasingly strong compared with those of women. Structural connections on each side of the cerebellum also grew stronger in male participants than female participants as they aged.

“One of the most interesting findings is that the timeline of sex differences in brain connectivity aligns with the timeline of sex-hormone levels across the lifespan,” says Yumnah Khan, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge, UK. 

She highlights the differences in the default mode network as potentially being linked to mental health. “Females are generally showing stronger functional connectivity,” she says, adding that hyperconnectivity in the default mode network has been linked with depression5.

One of Simon Clark's most popular TikTok videos begins with him playing the part of a clueless climate contrarian. Adopting the overconfident tone that is common among social-media influencers, he proclaims: “Renewables are a scam!”

The ‘PhD influencers' logging lab life on TikTok and Instagram

Cut to the real Clark, who has a PhD in stratospheric dynamics and uses the handle @simonoxfphys, as he dismantles several myths about renewable energy using a deadpan style and a torrent of charts. The video, with almost 180,000 views, is an effort to fight misinformation by meeting people where they are, he says.

Clark started making YouTube videos more than 15 years ago as a master's student in physics at the University of Oxford, UK. He wanted to help others learn about getting into elite universities and navigating the collegiate system. After he got his PhD from the University of Exeter, UK, he decided to make content creation a full-time career. “The natural thing in my field was talking about the climate crisis,” he says, “the physical causes behind it, the solutions we have to it, and increasingly at the moment, why we aren't implementing those solutions.”

Clark is now also on Instagram, Facebook and the live-streaming service Twitch, where he leans on his scientific credentials to both communicate science and combat misinformation. He is one of many scientists and medical experts who are countering the flood of anti-science advice and rhetoric across social-media platforms.

According to a 2025 report by the Reuters Institute in Oxford and the University of Oxford, 65% of people worldwide now consume video on social media1. Increasingly, many individuals, especially young people, get their news from these platforms. But a lot of that ‘news' is created by anti-science influencers who build loyal followings, using their position as opinion leaders to promote climate denialism, conspiracy theories, vaccine scepticism, autism myths, sham treatments and other pseudoscience.

A study last year, for example, analysed nearly 1,000 Instagram and TikTok posts about controversial medical screening tests. It found that the posts were overwhelmingly misleading — and that the people posting often had financial interests in the treatment2. Another study analysed the 100 most popular TikTok videos on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and found more than half to be misleading3. Yet the videos collectively had more than 280 million views.

To counteract this deluge of bad information, Clark and other pro-science content creators are taking strategies straight out of the influencer playbook.

Social scientist Louisa Ha at Bowling Green State University in Ohio says that content creators who intend to mislead use clear tactics: “They pretend to be authentic, trustworthy and knowledgeable,” she says. They blend facts with misinformation to make it hard to tell what is credible. “The best lie is one that mixes seemingly authoritative sources and some facts with false data and false arguments and appeals to people's beliefs and fears,” says Ha.

Whether a video provokes people to engage with it matters more than the video's accuracy, or even whether people agree with it, says Clark. The longer people linger on a video and the more they comment, the more likely it is that lots of people will see it.

Can giant surveys of scientists fight misinformation on COVID, climate change and more?

Can giant surveys of scientists fight misinformation on COVID, climate change and more?

Encouraging such engagement is a tactic that Clark uses. In 2020, he made a 40-minute YouTube video on the debate over nuclear power, focusing on why some people see it as the best low-carbon technology whereas others say the risk of catastrophe is too great. He knew that the topic would be controversial. “I imagine that no matter what I say, I'm about to piss a lot of people off,” he says in the video. And he was right: it has more than 500,000 views, and nearly 6,000 comments.

Comments tend to be highly valued by engagement algorithms. Some creators do simple things, such as wearing a shirt backwards, so that viewers will post a comment pointing it out, says Clark. “It's stupid”, he says, “but it works, so I guess it's not stupid.”

Misinformation abounds in the health and wellness space. As a registered dietician, Megan Rossi was struck by how many of her patients took diet advice from blogs and other online content. Frustrated by the lack of good science information, she started her own gut-health focused Instagram account @theguthealthdoctor in 2015, featuring video explainers about topics such as bloating, fibre, exercise and sleep, as well as offering recipe suggestions. (She has also developed a food brand and started a company that sells live bacteria supplements.)

Rossi leans into her credibility as a research fellow in nutritional sciences at King's College London, often referring to herself as a “gut specialist/dietician”. She says that she's careful to give advice based only on peer-reviewed evidence, and she typically cites her sources. Commenters often say things such as “very helpful” and “great info”, and thank her for not engaging in fearmongering.

The advent of social media has created communities that can more easily connect across time and space, and so has introduced a new type of opinion leader, says Amelia Burke-Garcia, director of the Center for Health Communication Science at the University of Chicago in Illinois. What's important, says Burke-Garcia, who has been working with influencers in the public-health space since 2008 (“although we didn't call them influencers then”), is to support credible voices and evidence in these communities.

How to speak to a vaccine sceptic: research reveals what works

In a qualitative study published last year, Burke-Garcia, public-health researcher Amy Leader at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and their colleagues asked ten influencers of colour who had children aged 9 to 14 to spread the word about vaccination against human papillomavirus4. The influencers, whom the researchers provided with a fact sheet, created emotionally charged posts that acknowledged parents' fears and used storytelling to describe their personal journeys towards a vaccination decision. Surveys of people who follow these influencers, Burke-Garcia says, revealed that the followers were more likely to consider vaccinating their children after hearing from someone to whom they could relate.

This relatability can help content creators to grow a loyal following. UK creator Emanuel Wallace, better known as Big Manny (@big.manny1), says that relatability, as well as authenticity, have been fundamental to his work. In his efforts to make chemistry and other science topics fun and accessible to young people, he has gained more than two million TikTok followers — and has made videos on the platform with Prince William and with Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown.

His videos show him doing science demonstrations ranging from standard classroom ones — what happens when you burn magnesium — to those requiring sophisticated set-ups and equipment. One video shows a chicken breast being exposed to the insides of a lithium battery. “This chicken breast represents you,” he says, before it bursts into flames. It's a powerful warning about the dangers of swallowing a lithium battery.

His expertise as a former secondary-school science technician comes through, even with his casual approach: “I don't really look like a typical scientist. I don't wear a lab coat. Sometimes I might have a tracksuit on. And I use colloquial terms in my speech,” he says. “I just be myself.”

When it comes to fighting misinformation, content creators take various approaches. Clark favours “pre-bunking” rather than debunking, which he finds less effective. He tries to reach a broad audience with solid facts that leave no room for ambiguity: “This is like vaccinating them against misinformation”.

Others have gained a reputation for challenging misinformation head-on. Russian–American creator Mikhail Varshavski, better known online as Doctor Mike (@doctormike), spends half of his week as a family-medicine physician and the other half creating content for his 14.6 million YouTube, 5.3 million Instagram and 2.7 million TikTok followers. He aims his content not just at people who agree with him, but also at those who haven't thought much about their health care, who have been hurt by the system or even who disagree with modern medicine.

Young, successful AI researchers are increasingly choosing to leave academia for industry.Credit: Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty

In 2025, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta collectively spent US$380 billion on building artificial-intelligence tools. That number is expected to surge still higher this year, to $650 billion, to fund the building of physical infrastructure, such as data centres (see go.nature.com/3lzf79q). Moreover, these firms are spending lavishly on one particular segment: top technical talent.

Meta reportedly offered a single AI researcher, who had co-founded a start-up firm focused on training AI agents to use computers, a compensation package of $250 million over four years (see go.nature.com/4qznsq1). Technology firms are also spending billions on ‘reverse-acquihires' — poaching the star staff members of start-ups without acquiring the companies themselves. Eyeing these generous payouts, technical experts earning more modest-salaries might well reconsider their career choices (see ‘Academic brain drain').

Academia is already losing out. Since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, concerns have grown in academia about an ‘AI brain drain'. Studies point to a sharp rise in university machine-learning and AI researchers moving to industry roles. A 2025 paper reported that this was especially true for young, highly cited scholars: researchers who were about five years into their careers and whose work ranked among the most cited were 100 times more likely to move to industry the following year than were ten-year veterans whose work received an average number of citations, according to a model based on data from nearly seven million papers1.

Source: Ref. 1

This outflow threatens the distinct roles of academic research in the scientific enterprise: innovation driven by curiosity rather than profit, as well as providing independent critique and ethical scrutiny. The fixation of ‘big tech' firms on skimming the very top talent also risks eroding the idea of science as a collaborative endeavour, in which teams — not individuals — do the most consequential work.

Here, we explore the broader implications for science and suggest alternative visions of the future.

Astronomical salaries for AI talent buy into a legend as old as the software industry: the 10x engineer. This is someone who is supposedly capable of ten times the impact of their peers. Why hire and manage an entire group of scientists or software engineers when one genius — or an AI agent — can outperform them?

That proposition is increasingly attractive to tech firms that are betting that a large number of entry-level and even mid-level engineering jobs will be replaced by AI. It's no coincidence that Google's Gemini 3 Pro AI model was launched with boasts of ‘PhD-level reasoning', a marketing strategy that is appealing to executives seeking to replace people with AI.

But the lone-genius narrative is increasingly out of step with reality. Research backs up a fundamental truth: science is a team sport. A large-scale study of scientific publishing from 1900 to 2011 found that papers produced by larger collaborations consistently have greater impact than do those of smaller teams, even after accounting for self-citation2. Analyses of the most highly cited scientists show a similar pattern: their highest-impact works tend to be those papers with many authors3. A 2020 study of Nobel laureates reinforces this trend, revealing that — much like the wider scientific community — the average size of the teams that they publish with has steadily increased over time as scientific problems increase in scope and complexity4.

Why an overreliance on AI-driven modelling is bad for science

Why an overreliance on AI-driven modelling is bad for science

From the detection of gravitational waves, which are ripples in space-time caused by massive cosmic events, to CRISPR-based gene editing, a precise method for cutting and modifying DNA, to recent AI breakthroughs in protein-structure prediction, the most consequential advances in modern science have been collective achievements. Although these successes are often associated with prominent individuals — senior scientists, Nobel laureates, patent holders — the work itself was driven by teams ranging from dozens to thousands of people and was built on decades of open science: shared data, methods, software and accumulated insight.

Building strong institutions is a much more effective use of resources than is betting on any single individual. Examples demonstrating this include the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the global team that first detected gravitational waves; the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a leading genomics and biomedical-research centre behind many CRISPR advances; and even for-profit laboratories such as Google DeepMind in London, which drove advances in protein-structure prediction with its AlphaFold tool. If the aim of the tech giants and other AI firms that are spending lavishly on elite talent is to accelerate scientific progress, the current strategy is misguided.

By contrast, well-designed institutions amplify individual ability, sustain productivity beyond any one person's career and endure long after any single contributor is gone.

Equally important, effective institutions distribute power in beneficial ways. Rather than vesting decision-making authority in the hands of one person, they have mechanisms for sharing control. Allocation committees decide how resources are used, scientific advisory boards set collective research priorities, and peer review determines which ideas enter the scientific record.

And although attempting ‘innovation by committee' might sound disparaging, such an approach is crucial to make the scientific enterprise act in concert with the diverse needs of the broader public. This is especially true in science, which continues to suffer from pervasive inequalities across gender, race and socio-economic and cultural differences5.

This is why scientists, academics and policymakers should pay more attention to how AI research is organized and led, especially as the technology becomes essential across scientific disciplines. Used well, AI can support a more equitable scientific enterprise by empowering junior researchers who currently have access to few resources.

Instead, some of today's wealthiest scientific institutions might think that they can deploy the same strategies as the tech industry uses and compete for top talent on financial terms — perhaps by getting funding from the same billionaires who back big tech. Indeed, wage inequality has been steadily growing within academia for decades6. But this is not a path that science should follow.

Calling nanoscientists: your field needs you to try to replicate a landmark finding that quantum dots can act as biosensors inside living cells. As part of the first large-scale effort in the physical sciences to tackle the reproducibility crisis, researchers in France and the Netherlands are offering funds and resources in exchange for a few months of work.

“We are trying to use replication as a tool to solve a controversy or, you know, to get closer to the truth,” says Raphaël Lévy, a physicist at Sorbonne Paris North University, who co-leads a European project called NanoBubbles, which focuses on self-correction in science. The project — named after bubbles of misinformation that can form when bad science is left uncorrected — made its call for help on 11 February. The appeal comes as separate research groups in psychology and the social sciences prepare to offer updates on their own large-scale replication efforts — prompted by the large number of scientific results that can't be repeated when others run the same tests.

Sometimes, these trials check that the data reported in published papers justify the results and conclusions. In other cases, they repeat the experiments from scratch. Last year, for example, a large-scale reproducibility project in Brazil tried and failed to validate dozens of biomedical studies.

Lévy, one of four researchers who lead the NanoBubbles project, which is backed by an €8-million (US$9.5-million) grant from the European Research Council, wants laboratories to revisit a 2012 study that suggested tiny, fluorescent carbon nanoparticles can detect copper ions inside living cells. This could have medical relevance because high copper levels are linked to diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The paper1, authored by a team led by Yang Tian, a chemist at Tongji University in Shanghai, China, is part of a wider research effort to develop engineered nanoparticles for various applications in imaging, diagnostics and drug delivery.

After pre-registering what they intended to do, the NanoBubbles team has tried and failed to replicate the findings in the paper. “I was really surprised, because in the published protocol, the fluorescence of the particles decreased when the concentration of the target increased, but in our experiments, it just stayed the same,” says Mustafa El Gharib, a nanoscientist also at Sorbonne Paris North University who attempted the replication. Tian did not respond to enquiries from Nature.

There are many possible reasons why work in this field might not replicate, says Wolfgang Parak, a physicist at the University of Hamburg, Germany, who is a member of the NanoBubbles advisory board but was not involved in Gharib's experiments.

As an example, Parak notes that one of his synthesis reactions became hard to reproduce after he moved his lab from the United States to Europe. “Surface chemistry is extremely sensitive to small impurities,” he says, and reagents in different countries could have varying amounts of contamination. Another problem is that experimental protocols sometimes don't describe steps in sufficient detail. So, any study that identifies crucial points in protocols and how to improve them is helpful.

Parak thinks the NanoBubbles replication was done well. “They really measured everything very carefully and used state-of-the-art techniques,” he says. Levy's team described the results in a preprint posted last year2, which is due to be published in Royal Society Open Science.

If you're interested in going paperless, you probably think you need a scanner. It's true that hardware scanners make turning multipage documents into PDFs very simple. But most of us don't have easy access to a scanner.

What we do have are phones, and those phones have very good cameras. That's where scanning apps come in.

These apps allow you to take photos of each page of a paper document, crop out the edges of the photo and straighten everything, then combine those photos into a PDF file. A scanning app is handy, but there's a catch: a lot of the apps out there are a mess.

That's what makes FairScan stand out. It's an app for scanning documents using your Android phone that just ... scans documents. That's it.

FairScan creator Pierre-Yves Nicolas wrote in a blog post last year that he had previously tried several Android apps for scanning documents. ""All of them exhibited behaviors that I certainly don't want,"" he says. These behaviors included obvious things like ads, hidden privacy violations, and shady practices such as storing your documents in the cloud—then using them to train AI—with only a tiny text prompt notifying you this is happening.

FairScan, which is both free and open source, doesn't do any of that. It scans.

To get started, simply install the app. And yes, it's Android-only for now, but you can download it from the Google Play Store as well as F-Droid, the repository for open source Android apps.

Get the document you want to scan ready, placing it on a flat surface in a well-lit room. Then aim your camera at the first page. A green box will surround the page—adjust until it's surrounding the portion of the document you want to scan. Take the picture when you're ready.

If you have more pages you can click the plus button to add them; this allows you to repeat the process with the next page. You can do this as many times as you want, allowing you to scan a multipage document.

When you're ready, you can export the scanned pages to either a single PDF or multiple JPEG files.

There are a few things you need to keep in mind while scanning. First, lighting is going to matter a lot. You don't want the shadow of your phone to be in the image, so make sure your phone isn't positioned between your light source and the document you're scanning. I find the app works best in a room with diffuse lighting, whether that's multiple lights illuminating your work surface, or several windows letting in a great deal of natural sunlight. It's also worth trying to get the paper document as flat as possible, to avoid distortions.

This application is very simple. There are a few features I'd personally like to see added, including the ability to edit pages after taking the photo and some kind of optical character recognition (OCR) that would digitize your scanned text and make it searchable.

But the major pro of the software—that it does its job without bothering you—is the killer feature here. What does it say about the state of the technology ecosystem that I find this such a big deal? A lot, actually.

All of us are hoping to use our phones as a tool—a way to achieve a specific end. And it's easy to also think of the applications you can install as tools. The problem: Most people who make apps aren't in the tool business. They're offering a nominally useful app in order to extract value from you in other ways—by serving you ads, forcing you into a subscription, or selling your personal data.

This isn't how tools have to work. If you buy a hammer, that hammer doesn't demand that you pay extra if you want to use it to close paint cans. It doesn't pepper you with notifications encouraging you to upgrade to HammerPro™️. You just have a hammer for doing all the hammer things. FairScan is like that, which makes it stand out in an increasingly enshittified field.

Rodney Buckley has lost 100 pounds in less than a year, not by using a GLP-1 drug but with the help of a digital twin. Last March, the 55-year-old retired firefighter turned village mayor of Third Lake, Illinois, was 376 pounds. He had tried different diets over the years and would typically lose some weight but eventually gain it back. When his wife's employer started offering a program from startup Twin Health, he thought he would give it a try.

With demand for Ozempic and other GLP-1 drugs soaring, employers are grappling with their high costs. At around $1,000 to $1,500 a month per person, these medications represent a rapidly increasing health care expense. It's why some employers are turning to non-medication alternatives to help people go off, reduce, or avoid GLP-1s entirely.

Mountain View, California–based Twin Health's approach uses a combination of wearables, AI, and on-demand health coaching to help manage diabetes, prediabetes, and obesity. The company sends users a kit with a continuous glucose monitor, blood pressure cuff, smart scale, and fitness tracker. Together, the devices collect data points on blood sugar, weight, stress, blood pressure, sleep, and activity and feed them into a single app. Using a predictive AI model, the app analyzes all this information to generate a virtual replica of the user's metabolism—the digital twin.

A clinical trial found that Twin can help people with type 2 diabetes control their blood sugar with fewer medications and lose weight. The program has led to medication savings for asset manager Blackstone, which has been using Twin Health for several years, while helping employees there lose weight.

“We are making an impact on people, and we are sustaining the health outcomes,” says Jahangir Mohammed, cofounder and CEO of Twin Health. He says he was inspired to start the company in 2018 because type 2 diabetes runs in his family.

The company has enrolled tens of thousands of people across nearly 200 employers. Twin gets paid only when users achieve certain clinical outcomes, such as lower blood sugar, weight loss, or the reduction of metabolic medications.

Users log what they're eating throughout the day by scanning food labels, taking pictures of their meals, or recording meals via voice. The app uses AI to analyze nutritional content and identifies foods as “green,” “yellow,” or “red”—green being the healthiest options and red being foods to avoid. Those colors can change as a person's metabolic health improves. A food that was once red might eventually turn yellow or green.

Based on logged meals, the app predicts a person's blood sugar response to those foods. It also makes personalized recommendations throughout the day, such as adjusting portion size, choosing a different food combination, or taking a walk after eating. Users can accept or ignore these suggestions—maybe broccoli isn't their favorite food, or they prefer to exercise during a particular time of the day. The app uses AI to adapt to their preferences over time. Users can also chat with human coaches if they have specific health questions.

For Buckley, Twin Health has helped him make healthier choices, such as swapping out frozen, prepackaged breakfast sandwiches for homemade breakfast burritos with low-carb, high-fiber wraps. He no longer drinks soda, and he walks several miles a day.

“When I first started the program, I could barely make it a mile before my back was hurting, my knee was hurting. Now I'm doing six and a half miles every morning,” he says.

He likes getting instant feedback from the app and also tracking his biometrics over time. He can see that his body fat percentage and blood pressure have been trending downward.

“That's where I get my motivation to keep walking and keep doing the work,” he says.

Buckley reached his initial weight goal of 300 pounds and is now around 275. After being on blood pressure medication for decades, his doctor recently suggested a lower dose.

When Twin Health approached the Cleveland Clinic's health plan about using its program, staff endocrinologist Kevin Pantalone was initially skeptical. He decided to conduct a study himself.

“We have really struggled to implement lifestyle modification in a very effective manner. Patients often require numerous therapies to control their diabetes,” he said. “So I was certainly very interested.” Despite the age-old advice of simply exercising more and eating healthy, most Americans struggle to get the recommended amount of weekly physical activity and have difficulty sticking to a healthy diet.

Pantalone and his colleagues recruited 150 participants with type 2 diabetes, randomly assigning 100 people to the Twin program and the rest to a control group. On average, participants were 58 years old with obesity and had a blood glucose level, or A1C, of 7.2 percent. A level of 6.5 percent or higher indicates diabetes. The goal of the trial was to see if participants could reach an A1C of less than 6.5 percent with fewer medications.

After 12 months, 71 percent of the study participants using the Twin app achieved that blood sugar level with fewer medications, whereas only 2 percent of people in the control group did. The people using Twin also lost more weight—8.6 percent of their body weight versus 4.6 percent in the control group.

At the beginning of the study, 41 percent of those using Twin were on a GLP-1 medication, but by the end of the study, only 6 percent still were. In the control group, 52 percent of participants started off on a GLP-1, and at the end of the study that increased to 63 percent. The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine Catalyst last year.

“I think it's the continuous, individualized recommendations in real time that help the patients to change behavior and to reinforce those changes in behavior,” Pantalone says. “Historically, when we refer patients for nutrition counseling, they're often overwhelmed.”

One of the study participants lost 25 pounds, went off all his diabetes medications, and was able to go hiking for the first time in 10 years, he says.

For some people, the data collection aspect of Twin's program may feel invasive. Weighing in or taking waistline measurements can be emotionally triggering. Those who have found success on GLP-1 drugs may be hesitant to get off them, especially if lifestyle changes haven't worked for them in the past.

While employers do not have access to identifiable, granular health information about individuals, they do receive an aggregated, anonymized report from Twin that tracks enrollment in the program and health outcomes over time. As a health care provider, Twin is required to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), as well as state privacy laws. The company says it conducts independent third-party security assessments.

Bernard Zinman, a diabetes expert and professor emeritus in the department of medicine at the University of Toronto who was not involved in the Cleveland Clinic study, is excited about the potential of digital twin technology.

“It's an interesting approach, and I think it's taking full advantage of digital health,” he says. “One of the things that we do know for sure is that all these interventions—diet and exercise being the most important—are more effective early in diabetes.” If more people had access to this kind of technology, they could potentially reverse their diabetes or prevent it from occurring in the first place, he says.

Pantalone thinks that's where the field is moving. “I do think we're going to see this type of technology being used by more people with overweight and obesity,” he says. “The hope is that the access to these types of interventions is going to improve with time.”

A short drive from London, the town of Potters Bar is separated from the village of South Mimms by 85 acres of rolling farmland segmented by a scribble of hedgerows. In one of the fields, a lone oak serves as a rest stop along a public footpath. Lately, the tree has become a site of protest, too. A poster tied to its trunk reads “No to Data Centre.”

In September 2024, a property developer applied for permission to build an industrial-scale data center—one of the largest in Europe—on the farmland. When locals caught wind, they started a Facebook group in hopes of blocking the project. More than 1,000 people signed up.

The local government has so far dismissed the group's complaints. In January 2025, it granted planning permission. The following October, multinational data center operator Equinix acquired the land; it intends to break ground this year.

On a dismal Thursday afternoon in January, I huddled around a gate leading onto the farmland with Ros Naylor—one of the Facebook group's admins—and six other local residents. They told me that they object to the data center on various grounds, but particularly to the loss of green space, which they see as an invaluable escape route from town to countryside and buffer against the highway and fuel stop visible on the horizon. “The beauty of walking in this area is coming through this space,” says Naylor. “It's incredibly important for mental health and well-being.”

As the UK government races to meet the voracious demand for data centers that can be used to train AI models and run AI applications, similarly large facilities stand to be built across the country. For the people who live in closest proximity, though, the prospect that AI might buoy the economy or infuse new capabilities into their smartphone is thin consolation for what they consider a disruption to a countryside way of life.

Since the mid-20th century, London has been hemmed in on all sides by a nearly contiguous patchwork of land known as the greenbelt, made up of farms, forest, meadows, and parks. Under UK law, construction is only permitted on greenbelt land in “very special circumstances.” The aim is to protect areas of countryside from urban encroachment and stop neighboring towns from melding into an amorphous blob.

After the present government came to power in 2024, however, the UK introduced a new land classification—gray belt—to describe underperforming parcels of greenbelt on which construction should be more readily permitted. At around the same time, the government announced it would treat data centers as “critical national infrastructure.” Together, those changes have cleared the way for a raft of new data centers to be built across the UK.

As they attempt to develop models capable of surpassing human intelligence, the world's largest AI labs are planning to spend trillions of dollars in aggregate on infrastructure. Across the globe, wherever new data centers are being built, developers are encountering organized resistance from impacted communities.

When the local planning authority approved the Potters Bar data center, its officers concluded that the farmland met the definition of gray belt. They also said their decision was colored by the government's support for the data center industry. The benefits from an infrastructure development and economic standpoint, they concluded, outweighed the loss of green space.

“People have this slightly romantic idea that all greenbelt land comprises pristine, rolling green fields. The reality is that this site, along with many others, is anything but that,” says Jeremy Newmark, leader of Hertsmere Borough Council, the constituency that encompasses Potters Bar. “It's a patch of very low-performing greenbelt land.”

The protest group disputes the reclassification of the farmland, partly on the basis that the local council recently vetoed a planning application for a housing development on a neighboring field expressly to preserve greenbelt and agricultural land. They ask how one field can be dispensable and the adjacent plot invaluable. “Turn around, cross the road, come to this field—and it's gray belt,” says Eamonn Lynch, one of the residents.

The protesters also say they feel steamrolled by the planning process. During the initial public consultation, the council notified people living in 775 nearby properties about the data center plan. Simon Rhodes—another resident I met in January—went door-to-door to spread the word further. He claims to have collected hundreds of objections, which he submitted to the planning authority. By the end of the consultation, objections filed by locals outweighed signatures of support by almost two-to-one. The council granted planning permission anyway.

To try to overturn the decision, the protest group has lodged multiple letters of objection, appealed to a third-party ombudsman and the UK's Office of Environmental Protection, and filed a complaint against Newmark personally, whom it accused of acting as a mouthpiece for the property developer.

So far, nothing has worked. The council ruled there was nothing improper about the planning process, and a standards committee cleared Newmark of any wrongdoing. “I completely reject the idea that the consultation process was flawed or that this was in any way rushed through,” says Newmark. The housing development being blocked nearby is irrelevant, he says, because every planning application is considered in isolation.

Faced with the complaints of the protest group, the local government has promoted the anticipated benefits of the new data center to the local economy and labor market.

Equinix estimates it will spend more than $5 billion on the development, which it expects to create 2,500 construction jobs and 200 permanent roles. Once operational, the data center is set to generate roughly $27 million in annual property tax, the council estimates, half of which will be retained by the local government and directed toward frontline services.

“For anybody to suggest that an investment at that level, in a place like this, will not have a major impact on our local economy is seriously misguided,” says Newmark. “There is ample evidence that data centers attract other high-tech businesses to cluster nearby. The effect is potentially exponential.”

While Equinix has 14 data centers in the UK, this would be its first on a rural site there. The company was attracted to the Potters Bar plot for its proximity to major population hubs and existing Equinix facilities—which helps to reduce latency—and for the strength of the local power infrastructure, says Andrew Higgins, global head of master planning and sustainability at Equinix.

The company will lease space in the facility to various clients, many of which will be running AI workloads, says Higgins. “If we want to continue to have the UK being a world player, absolutely data centers have to be built,” he says.

Equinix says half of the site will remain as green space; to increase biodiversity, the company will introduce ponds, wetlands, meadows, and new trees. “Sincerely, I can empathize with people who live in a rural community and are used to that landscape,” says Higgins. “I hope that we can demonstrate there is a path to responsible development.”

Higgins says he has never encountered a situation where planning permission for an Equinix site has been subsequently withdrawn.

“Ultimately, I believe it's a very small number of admittedly very vocal people who take a dogmatic view that we exist in a binary where you can have either greenbelt or growth,” says Newmark. “My advice to them would be to get with the program.”

For Equinix to begin construction, it must hurdle a final stage in the planning process, obtaining permission for the particulars of its plan for the site. For the planning permission to remain valid, it must begin construction within three years of final approval being granted.

To that end, part of the protest group's strategy is to mount a sort of filibuster, by objecting at every possible opportunity. “I think the pressure group, depending how well-organized it is, can make a big difference,” says Michael Batty, emeritus professor of planning at University College London. “The whole idea of public objection is writ large in the planning system in Britain.”

That afternoon in January, after the other residents had left, I walked a lap of the farmland with Janet Longley, a semiretired teacher who has lived in the area since the 1980s. As we trailed after her boxer dog, Lola, ankle-deep mud sucked at our boots. We stopped under the oak tree.

Longley, whose husband works in IT, is clear-eyed about the potential for data centers to contribute to expanding the national economy and the value of the digital services they make possible. “I don't like the idea of being a NIMBY, because we need these things,” she says. “I use the internet all the time.”

Nonetheless, Longley resents the green space where she has walked her dogs for so many years being dismissed by the council as dispensable. She can't help but wish this thing would be built somewhere else.

“Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,” said Longley, gesturing across the field. “It is actually beautiful. Just maybe not so much today.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Inside the Homeland Security Forum Where ICE Agents Talk Shit About Other Agents","https://www.wired.com/story/hsi-forum-ice-agents/","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 14:00:00 GMT","

Every day, people log into an online forum for current and former Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) officers to share their thoughts on the news of the day and complain about their colleagues in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

“ERO is too busy dressing up as Black Ops Commandos with Tactical body armor, drop down thigh rigs, balaclavas, multiple M4 magazines, and Punisher patches, to do an Admin arrest of a non criminal, non-violent EWI that weighs 90 pounds and is 5 foot 2, inside a secure Federal building where everyone has been screened for weapons,” wrote one user in July 2025. (ERO stands for Enforcement and Removal Operations; along with HSI, it's one of the two major divisions of ICE, and is responsible for detaining and deporting immigrants.)

The forum describes itself as a space for current and prospective HSI agents, “designed for the seasoned HSI Special Agent as well as applicants for entry level Special Agent positions.” HSI is the division within ICE whose agents are normally responsible for investigating crimes like drug smuggling, terrorism, and human trafficking.

In the forum, users discuss their discomfort with the US's mass deportation efforts, debate the way federal agents have interacted with protesters and the public, and complain about the state of their working conditions. Members have also had heated discussions about the shooting of two protesters in Minneapolis, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, and the ways immigration enforcement has taken place around the US.

The forum is one of several related forums where people working in different parts of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) share experiences and discuss specific details of their work. WIRED previously reported on a forum where current and former deportation officers from ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) similarly complained about their jobs and discussed the way the agency was conducting immigration raids. The HSI forum appears to be linked, even including some of the same members.

People do not need to show proof of their employment to join these forums, and the platform does not appear to be heavily moderated. WIRED has not confirmed the individual identities of these posters, though posters share details that likely would only be known to those intimately familiar with the job. There are more than 2,000 members with posts going back to at least 2004.

DHS and ICE did not respond to requests for comment.

Following the killings of both Good and Pretti, the forum's members were heavily divided. In a January 12 thread, five days after Good was shot by ICE agent Jonathan Ross, a poster who has been a part of the forum since 2016 wrote, “IMHO, the situation with ICE Operations have gotten to an unprecedented level of violence from both the Suspects and the General Public. I hope the AG is looking at the temporary suspension of Civil Liberties, (during and in the geographic locales where ICE Operations are being conducted).”

A user who joined the forum in 2018 and identifies as a recently retired agent responded, “This is an excellent idea and well warranted. These are organized, well financed civil disturbances, dare I say an INSURRECTION?!?”

In a January 16 post titled “The Shooting,” some posters took a more nuanced view. “I get that it is a good shoot legally and all that, but all he had to do was step aside, he nearly shot one of his partners for Gods sake!” wrote a poster who first joined the forum in March 2022. “A USC woman non-crim shot in the head on TV for what? Just doesn't sit well with me… A seasoned SRT guy who was able to execute someone while holding a phone seems to me he could have simply got out of the way.” SRT refers to ICE's elite special response team, who undergo special training to operate in high-risk situations. USC refers to US citizens.

“You clearly haven't been TDY anywhere. Yes, they were going to arrest her for 111,” responded another poster who joined the forum in June 2018. “Tons of USCs are being arrested for it daily.” 111 refers to the part of the US criminal code that deals with assaulting, resisting, or impeding federal officers; TDY refers to “temporary duty,” where officers are pulled to different locations for a limited period of time.

“Can't believe we have ‘supposed agents' here questioning the shooting of a domestic terrorist,” wrote a third user who joined the forum in December 2025. (In the wake of the shooting, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem called Good a “domestic terrorist.”)

“If you think a fat unarmed lesbian in a Honda is a ‘Terrorist' then you are a fake ass cop!” the original poster replied. “I have worked real Terrorism cases, and I am not saying it was a bad shoot and not defending her. I am just saying it did not have to happen.”

Later in the thread, a poster who joined the forum in July 2023 replied, “Remember, these are the same agents who think J6'ers were just misunderstood rowdy tourists, and that Ashley Babbitt is a national hero…and if you dare say something negative about Trump, or try to hold him accountable, you're suddenly a leftie, communist, lunatic (even though I'm a Republican).”

In a different thread following the shooting of Pretti on January 24 by a CBP agent, a poster who has been a part of the forum since 2023 and who also identified as a retired agent wrote, “Yet another ‘justified' fatal shooting…They all carry gun belts and vest with 9,000 pieces of equipment on them and then best they can do is shoot a guy in the back.”

The thread devolved into posters debating whether members of the January 6 insurrection were domestic terrorists, and why Kyle Rittenhouse, who shot and killed two people during a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest, was apprehended alive.

“I just want to mention, we all get emotions are heightened right now. But I highly doubt being a legacy customs guy you ever did anything where the risk was beyond the potential for paper cuts,” wrote a user who first joined the forum in June 2025. “It's a new day with new threats in an environment you never fathomed in your career.”

Even before the shootings of Good and Pretti, members of the forum questioned the wisdom of bringing HSI into the Trump administration's mass mobilization around immigration enforcement. HSI deals specifically with criminal cases and investigations, but living and working in the US without documentation is a civil offense, and the majority of immigrants who were detained or deported in 2025 had not committed any crimes.

One poster complained that doing so was pulling HSI resources away from more urgent casework.

“The use of 1811s — HSI or otherwise — for administrative immigration enforcement is a complete misuse of resources,” wrote a user who joined the forum in October 2022 in a January 7 post. 1811's refers to a category of law enforcement officers generally referred to as special agents who conduct criminal investigations. “They could be doing these crime surges for literally any type of federal criminal investigations (drugs, child exploitation, gangs, etc.), and it would be a much better use of resources. Not only that, our reputations would still be intact.”

Others in the forum have complained about HSI's relationship with ICE's ERO teams. “It's pretty bad when ERO at a large metropolitan city get's backed up with 30 bodies and they call the SA's in to process,” wrote a poster on July 7, 2025 who has been a part of the forum since 2010. SAs refers to special agents. “I guess that is what happens when they have not done any immigration work in decades.”

“Complete opposite in our [area of responsibility],” a poster who first joined the forum in 2012 replied. “No one has a clue what most of ero is doing and are asking us to be included on anything immigration we're doing and introduce them to DEA contacts working investigations involving illegals.”

A third poster, who has been a forum member since 2024, added that “ERO does essentially nothing. I walked in the office the other day and the HSI SAs were doing jail pickups and processing. The ERO folks were gathered around a desk drinking coffee and joking around.” In cases where ICE has a request out to jails for a person they're pursuing, known as an immigration detainer, jails will hold that person for up to “48 hours beyond the time they would ordinarily release them” to allow ICE to pick them up.

In the lead up to federal immigration authorities' operations in Minneapolis, members complained about long hours. “How are RHAs expected to go on TDYs with NO days off and lots of [overtime] when they are all capped out (biweekly and yearly [sic]),” complained a user who first joined the forum in December 2004 in a post from December 7, 2025. RHAs refers to rehired annuitants, or retired federal agents who have returned to the job and continue to collect their federal retirement benefits. “ERO has NO caps.”

“I'm capped out so only getting paid for 5 days at 10 hours a day,” wrote the user who first joined the forum in 2010 in another thread (overtime pay rules can vary from agency to agency). ”Anything over 50 hours a week and I'm working for free.”

Others in the forum said they were waiting for their promised sign-on bonuses, and expressed disappointment with what they saw in their paychecks. For rehired annuitants, ICE offered a signing bonus of up to $50,000. “Not sure how they calculated the current pay from the super check received today, but mine can't be right,” a poster who joined the forum in 2021 wrote in an October post. “My super check netted me a grand total of $600 more.”

In another thread on bonuses, a user who has been a forum member since 2005 replied, “I got a deposit last night or early this morning,” they wrote. “It looks like 10k after taxes plus my regular pay check. Not sure yet. However the deal was 20K. WTF?!”

In a December thread, other members discussed the way immigration agents had begun to interact more aggressively with protesters. The user identified as a retired agent wrote, “I've seen a lot of videos lately of HSI or ERO agents getting triggered by civilians taking photos or videos of them or their vehicles. In several of the videos the agents are seen jumping out of their GOVs, manhandling the civilian, and smashing or confiscating their phones.” The user expressed bewilderment about the behavior, writing that they “would have been fired and/or prosecuted for something like this. I believe everyone knows at this point that taking photos/videos is a protected act unless someone is clearly impeding or obstructing (which doesn't always appear to be the case).”

Another poster, who joined the forum in September 2025, replied, “Ah...Cell phone video. You can make them tell what ever story you want with creative editing.”

As part of the response to immigration operations, particularly in Minnesota, civilians have organized to monitor federal agents, coordinating to witness and record their operations, and sometimes tailing suspected ICE vehicles, checking licence plates in Signal groups. Federal agents, in turn, have been seen taking photos and videos of protesters, with one legal observer in Maine claiming that an agent told her she would be added to a terror watchlist. (In testimony this week, Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE told members of Congress that ICE was not making such a list of US citizens.)

In posts throughout the forum, members also complain about their access to gear and the agency's technology. “Apparently there is enough money to buy a bunch of ICE marked cars but not get us some basic protective gear…” wrote one user on January 27, who joined the forum in 2025.

“I also have a suspicion that HQ or the [Executive Associate Director] have not advocated to get us gear to handle all the nut job protesters,” they wrote in a follow up post.

On a thread named “Alien Processing” that started in July 2025, posters complained about “How is it that with all the technology we have and an entire fkn building full of computer geeks this fkn agency cannot make a fkn system that works properly and effectively in a simple user friendly fashion? This Eagle crap is a total mess!” one poster wrote. EAGLE refers to Enforcement Integrated Database (EID) called EID Arrest Guide for Law Enforcement, a system to process the biometric and personal information for people arrested by ICE. “It takes longer to process a fkn alien than it does to actually catch them. We dont need 10,000 new ICE Officers/Agents, just hire fkn people to process them so we can do our jobs of catching them.”

Members also talked about their preferred pieces of ICE tech: Another user, who joined the forum in March 2025, responded to the “Alien Processing” thread, writing “Mobile Fortify is the best thing that has come out in a long time,” in reference to the mobile facial recognition app used by federal agents to identify people in the field.

According to DHS's 2025 AI Use Case Inventory, agents have been able to use Mobile Fortify since May 2025. The app uses AI, trained with CBP's “Vetting/Border Crossing Information/ Trusted Traveler Information,” to match a picture taken by agents and “contactless” fingerprints with existing records. 404 Media reported that the app has misidentified at least one person—perhaps because, as WIRED has reported, it wasn't designed to be used for what ICE is using it for.

Though ICE's surge in Minnesota appears to be entering a drawdown, the agency is continuing to expand its footprint across the US, and investing in a network of detention centers and large warehouses for holding immigrants, all indicating that detentions and deportations are not expected to slow down.

“Put yourself in the shoes of the guys in the street strung out on crazy op tempo, being threatened and antagonized all day, having inept leadership, low morale, and then having to fight every formerly low risk non-crim (or barely crim) because they are all hyped up on victim status and liberal energy. Plus hyper partisan radicalization on both sides,” the user who joined the forum in June 2025 wrote. “If you think the news is enraging you now, wait till this spring/summer when we need to fill the mega detention centers.”

Seattle startup Certivo raised $4 million in seed funding to expand its AI-powered platform aimed at automating supply chain compliance. 

Boston-based Suffolk Technologies, which specializes in construction technology investments, led the round. Seattle-based Pioneer Square Labs also invested. Total funding to date is $6 million.

Certivo, which spun out of PSL in 2024, says the funding marks the emergence of a new category it calls “AI-native compliance automation.” The startup wants to replace manual compliance processes with intelligent systems that operate around the clock.

Its platform centers on what it calls a Compliance System of Record, powered by an AI agent named CORA. The system automatically collects and validates supplier documentation, tracks regulatory changes across jurisdictions, maps compliance requirements to product portfolios, and integrates with existing software apps to maintain a real-time compliance record.

The 17-person startup is targeting manufacturers and companies in the “built world,” helping them navigate evolving regulations around PFAS, sustainability mandates, and supply chain transparency.

The company declined to provide metrics on customers or revenue.

Certivo, which emerged from a partnership between PSL and Fortive, is led by former Kaspien CEO and longtime Seattle tech leader Kunal Chopra. More recently he was CEO of Beckett Collectibles. Chopra also spent time at Microsoft, Amazon, Unikrn, and Groupon in executive roles.

“We built Certivo as an AI-native system that makes compliance continuous, proactive, and durable,” Chopra said in a statement.

Certivo co-founder Ahmed Khan left the company last year and is working on a new stealth startup, according to LinkedIn. 

Certivo is one of various startups applying AI to historically manual enterprise functions such as compliance. Signify is a similar Seattle-based company that spun out of the AI2 Incubator that raised $2.1 million in 2024.

Seattle-based real estate company Zillow has partnered with the company behind the long-running online game World of Warcraft in order to showcase players' creativity by exhibiting their virtual homes.

A new microsite, “Zillow for Warcraft,” allows users to explore an assortment of designs for in-game housing, both those made by players and by members of WoW's development team. Some of these homes will be presented using the same methods as Zillow's real-world virtual tours, such as with 3D modeling and SkyTour visuals, so users can poke around a fantasy kitchen just as if it was real.

World of Warcraft, published and developed by Microsoft subsidiary Blizzard Entertainment, recently unveiled player housing as a feature of its newest paid expansion, Midnight. Owners of the expansion can opt to take their characters to an in-game island, where they're given a plot of land and a small house to customize and decorate however they wish.

(Midnight also involves a life-and-death struggle against a shadow-wielding antagonist who plans to seize and corrupt the very heart of the game's world, but in much of its marketing so far, Blizzard has chosen to emphasize the new home-building feature. Go figure.)

“Player housing is a milestone moment for the World of Warcraft community, and we wanted to honor it in a way that felt authentic and unexpected,” Beverly W. Jackson, vice president of brand and product marketing at Zillow, said in a press release.

Jackson continued: “Zillow exists at the center of how people think and talk about home, and gaming has become another powerful expression of that. This collaboration brings two worlds together, celebrating home as both a place to belong and a place to escape into something that feels honest and personal.”

As part of the Zillow collaboration, WoW players will be able to unlock a number of decorative items for their in-game homes, such as a unique doormat.

Notably, Zillow for Warcraft features no transactions at all. You will not be able to exchange real or virtual money for anything seen on the website. It's simply a free virtual tour of what players have been able to accomplish with WoW's new housing system.

The deal with Zillow is one of several bizarre new brand deals that Blizzard has made for Midnight, including a collaboration with Pinterest that can unlock an in-game camera. While the primary driver of World of Warcraft is still widespread armed conflict in an increasingly vast fantasy universe, the introduction of housing seems to have spurred Blizzard into also pitching it to a new audience as a cozy house-building simulator. It's simply that to get new furniture, you occasionally may have to go to another dimension and beat it out of a dragon.

World of Warcraft celebrated its 21st anniversary in November. Midnight, its 11th expansion, is planned to go live on March 2.

Temporal has raised $300 million in a Series D funding round at a $5 billion valuation, positioning the company as a key infrastructure provider for the emerging wave of AI agents moving into real-world production.

The latest round, led by Andreessen Horowitz, doubles the company's valuation from October.

Temporal builds open-source software and a cloud service that helps companies run long-running, complex workflows reliably — what it calls “durable execution.” The Bellevue, Wash.-based company says that as AI systems become more autonomous and take actions across multiple services, reliability has become a challenge. 

“Agentic AI doesn't fail because the models aren't good enough,” Samar Abbas, CEO and co-founder of Temporal, said in a press release. “It fails because the systems around them can't handle real-world execution.”

Temporal says revenue grew more than 380% year-over-year, weekly active usage increased 350%, and installations rose 500%. Its cloud platform has processed 9.1 trillion lifetime action executions, including 1.86 trillion for AI-native companies.

OpenAI uses Temporal to help power certain production workflows. Other customers include ADP, Yum! Brands, and Block. Andreessen Horowitz described Temporal as becoming a foundational execution layer for the AI era.

“For long-running agents operating over extended horizons, the durability that Temporal provides is the difference between a compelling demo and a production system,” the Silicon Valley firm wrote in a blog post. “The underlying execution layer has become a central piece of the emerging AI agent stack.”

Temporal originally focused on helping developers manage complex, distributed workflows. But the rise of AI agents has amplified the need for infrastructure that can safely execute long-running, stateful systems over extended periods. Temporal's platform preserves application state, automatically retries failed steps, and allows workflows to resume exactly where they left off instead of starting over.

Temporal co-founders Samar Abbas and Maxim Fateev previously worked together at Uber and helped build an internal open-source orchestration engine called Cadence. The experience helped inspire them to launch Temporal in 2019. Fateev previously worked at Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. Abbas also worked at Microsoft and Amazon.

Abbas took over CEO duties from Fateev in 2024. Fateev is now CTO.

Temporal has raised $650 million to date. It closed a $105 million secondary transaction in October, and raised $146 million Series C round earlier in 2025. The company employs 375 people. 

Temporal also announced Tuesday that Raghu Raghuram, former VMware CEO and general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, is joining the company as a board observer.

Other backers in the latest round include Lightspeed Venture Partners and Sapphire Ventures, along with existing investors including Sequoia Capital, Index, Tiger, GIC, Madrona, and Amplify.

by Lisa Stiffler on Feb 16, 2026 at 8:15 pmFebruary 16, 2026 at 8:27 pm

The so-called “millionaires tax” was approved by Washington's Senate on Monday, advancing a measure that would create a 9.9% tax applied to taxable, personal annual income that exceeds $1 million.

Gov. Bob Ferguson earlier this month criticized Senate Bill 6346 for doing too little for small businesses and lower-income residents in the state. The measure passed Monday included changes that made more small businesses eligible for a business and occupation (B&O) tax exemption.

“The proposal is moving in the right direction,” Ferguson said in a statement. “That said, as the process moves forward in the final weeks of the legislative session, we must direct significantly more revenue directly back to hardworking Washington families and small businesses owners. I look forward to our continued partnership to make our state more affordable.”

The measure passed with 27 Democratic lawmakers voting yes. The 22 no votes included three Democrats.

Lawmakers adopted two amendments, including one to repeal a new sales tax expansion on select services that sparked controversy in the tech industry and a lawsuit from Comcast last year. However, the expansion on advertising services would not be repealed as part of the amendment, which would take effect in 2030. 

SB 6346 marks the first time in decades that state lawmakers have pursued a personal income tax aimed at high‑income residents. The legislation would go into effect in two years and includes small business and low‑income tax breaks.

The bill has drawn opposition from some tech leaders and entrepreneurs who worry it could undermine the sector by souring Washington's relatively favorable tax laws for startup founders, investors and high-wage earners.

Supporters of the proposed law argue those fears are overblown and say the bill helps correct the state's regressive tax code, which relies heavily on property, sales and business taxes to fund education and other public programs. 

The bill is expected to generate an estimated $3.7 billion annually. 

The action comes as the state is struggling to plug a more than $2 billion budget hole with spending cuts and a slate of potential tax changes, while at the same time some of Washington's largest employers are cutting thousands of jobs from their payrolls.

SB 6346 would: 

The income tax would be used in part to expand the Working Families Tax Credit, which provides a sales tax rebate for low- to moderate- income families. It also helps fund the public defense system.

“Today was a momentous step forward. For Washington's 1.1 million school kids, people struggling to afford health care, and small businesses looking for help, that help is on the way,” said bill sponsor and Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, in a statement. 

Washington is one of nine states that lack an income tax. If approved by lawmakers, the governor said the proposed tax was certain to go before voters for approval and would face legal challenges as well.

Kirby Winfield, founding general partner at Seattle venture capital firm Ascend, is among those against the legislation. 

“This tax is just another brick in the wall of anti-entrepreneurialism from state and local legislators. The average Amazon employee probably won't mind, but this stuff is devastating to company creation,” Winfield told GeekWire earlier this month. 

As state leaders look to impose a levy on wages, they're also working to repeal a recently passed policy that substantially increased Washington's estate tax and drew criticism from tech leaders. The new proposal, Senate Bill 6347, also passed on Monday, with 38 lawmakers from both parties voting in favor and 11 Democrats voting against the bill.

Democratic leaders backing SB 6347 feared that wealthy residents would leave the state to avoid the tax — which is significantly higher than any other estate tax, the Seattle Times reported.

Pedersen told the Seattle Times that when it comes to taxes, “it's not good for us to be an outlier.”

Both bills will now be considered by the House of Representatives. This year's 60-day legislative session is scheduled to end March 12.

Airbnb said on Tuesday that it is launching its “Reserve Now, Pay Later” feature — which lets users secure bookings without immediate payment —  globally. This allows users to cancel their bookings if there is a change of plans without losing money upfront.

The company launched the feature in the U.S. last year for domestic travel. Airbnb said that properties with a “flexible” or “moderate” cancellation policy are eligible for the upfront reservation. With this option, users get charged closer to their check-in date rather than at the time of booking. The feature mirrors “buy now, pay later” payment plans that have become popular in e-commerce, making expensive travel more accessible by spreading out costs. The company noted that since the launch, the feature saw 70% adoption for eligible bookings.

During its earnings calls for Q4 2025, Airbnb said that the feature helped grow nights booked in the quarter.

“Reserve Now, Pay Later saw significant adoption among eligible guests in Q4. It's also led to longer booking lead times and a mix shift towards larger entire homes, especially those with four or more bedrooms, contributing to the increase in average daily rate,” Ellie Mertz, CFO of Airbnb, said during the call.

Mertz noted that Airbnb's overall cancellation rate jumped from 16% to 17% for the quarter, and it was higher among customers who use the upfront booking product. However, she said that this was “not hugely material relative to the broader cancellations on the platform.”

Last year, the company surveyed U.S. travelers along with Focaldata, a London-based market research and polling company. Of those surveyed, 60% of participants said that a flexible payment option is important while booking a holiday, and 55% said that would use a flexible payment option.

The company has been experimenting with pay-later products for years now. Back in 2018, Airbnb launched a product that allowed users to book a property by paying 20% or 50% of the total charges. upfront, with the rest due later. In 2023, the company partnered with fintech firm Klarna to let users pay for their stays in four installments over six weeks.

Enterprise AI company Cohere launched a new family of multilingual models on the sidelines of the ongoing India AI Summit. The models, dubbed Tiny Aya, are open-weight — meaning their underlying code is publicly available for anyone to use and modify — support over 70 languages, and can run on everyday devices like laptops without requiring an internet connection.

The model, launched by the company's research arm Cohere Labs, supports South Asian languages such as Bengali, Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu, and Marathi. 

The base model contains 3.35 billion parameters — a measure of its size and complexity. Cohere has also launched TinyAya-Global, a version fine-tuned to better follow user commands, for apps that require broad language support. Regional variants round out the family: TinyAya-Earth for African languages; TinyAya-Fire for South Asian languages; and TinyAya-Water for Asia Pacific, West Asia, and Europe.

“This approach allows each model to develop stronger linguistic grounding and cultural nuance, creating systems that feel more natural and reliable for the communities they are meant to serve. At the same time, all Tiny Aya models retain broad multilingual coverage, making them flexible starting points for further adaptation and research,” the company said in a statement.

Cohere noted that these models, which were trained on a single cluster of 64 H100 GPUs (a type of high-powered chip by Nvidia) using relatively modest computing sources, are ideal for researchers and developers building apps for audiences that speak native languages. The models are capable of running directly on devices, so developers can use them to power offline translation. The company noted that it built its underlying software to suit on-device usage, requiring less computing power than most comparable models.

In linguistically diverse countries like India, this kind of offline-friendly capability can open up a diverse set of applications and use cases without the need for constant internet access.

The models are available on HuggingFace, the popular platform for sharing and testing AI models, and the Cohere Platform. Developers can download them on HuggingFace, Kaggle, and Ollama for local deployment. The company is also releasing training and evaluation datasets on HuggingFace and plans to release a technical report detailing its training methodology.

The startup's CEO, Aidan Gomez, said last year that the company plans to go public “soon.” According to CNBC, the company ended 2025 on a high note, posting $240 million in annual recurring revenue, with 50% growth quarter-over-quarter throughout the year.

Indian IT giant Infosys said on Tuesday it has partnered with Anthropic to develop enterprise-grade AI agents, as automation driven by large language models reshapes the global IT services industry.

Under the partnership, Infosys plans to integrate Anthropic's Claude models into its Topaz AI platform to build so-called “agentic” systems. The companies claim these agents will be able to autonomously handle complex enterprise workflows across industries such as banking, telecoms, and manufacturing. The tie-up was announced at India's AI Impact Summit in New Delhi this week, which will see top executives from AI companies and Big Tech alike in attendance.

The deal comes amid fears that AI tools, especially those built by major AI labs like Anthropic and OpenAI, will disrupt India's heavily-staffed, $280 billion IT services industry, raising questions about the future of labor-intensive outsourcing business models. Earlier this month, shares of Indian IT companies went into freefall after Anthropic launched a suite of enterprise AI tools that claimed to automate tasks across legal, sales, marketing and research roles.

The partnership would give Infosys, one of the world's largest IT services businesses, access to Anthropic's Claude models and developer tools for building AI agents tailored for large enterprises. Infosys said it would use Anthropic's Claude Code to help write, test and debug code, and said it is already deploying the tool internally to build expertise that will be applied to client work.

Infosys also detailed how AI is contributing to its business: AI-related services generated revenue of ₹25 billion (around $275 million), or 5.5% of the company's total revenue of ₹454.8 billion (about $5 billion) in the December quarter. Rival Tata Consultancy Services previously said its AI services generate about $1.8 billion annually, or around 6% of revenue.

For Anthropic, the partnership offers a route into heavily regulated enterprise sectors where deploying AI systems at scale requires industry expertise and governance capabilities.

“There's a big gap between an AI model that works in a demo and one that works in a regulated industry,” said Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei. Infosys' experience in sectors such as financial services, telecoms, and manufacturing helps bridge that gap, he said.

Anthropic this week also opened its first India office in Bengaluru, as it seeks to expand further into the country, which has grown into the company's second-largest market. Anthropic said India now accounts for about 6% of global Claude usage, second only to the U.S., and much of that activity is concentrated in programming.

Infosys did not disclose the timeline for deploying Claude-powered AI agents or the financial terms of the deal.

The partnership is similar to other moves by Indian IT services firms. HCLTech and OpenAI last year partnered up to help enterprises deploy AI tools at scale.

Indian conglomerate Adani Group said on Monday it would invest $100 billion over the next decade to build data centers specialized for AI across the country, a move that underscores India's ambition to play a larger role in the global AI race.

The investment, which will run through 2035, is aimed at building renewable-energy-powered data centers designed to support AI workloads, the company said. It expects the plan to catalyze an additional $150 billion in related investments and result in a $250 billion AI infrastructure ecosystem in India over the decade.

Adani is making this commitment against a backdrop of skyrocketing investments in AI infrastructure as companies increasingly look beyond the U.S. for computing power, energy and friendly regulation. India, with its expanding digital economy and growing renewable-energy capacity, has emerged as a major destination for data centers and AI-related infrastructure over the past couple of years.

The announcement coincides with India's ongoing AI Impact Summit in New Delhi this week, where leaders from some of the world's top AI companies, including OpenAI, Nvidia, Anthropic, Microsoft and Google, are meeting policymakers and industry executives.

Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani (pictured above) described the plan as a long-term bet on the convergence of energy and computing. “India will not be a mere consumer in the AI age,” he said, adding that the group aims to help build a domestic AI infrastructure base.

The plan is to build atop Adani's own existing data-center platform and its partnerships with companies like Google and Microsoft. The conglomerate is developing large-scale AI data-center campuses in Visakhapatnam and Noida, and has plans for more facilities in Hyderabad and Pune. An expanded partnership with Walmart-owned Flipkart will focus on another AI data center.

Adani said the broader plan calls for deploying up to 5 gigawatts of data-center capacity. The company said the facilities will be developed as a unified system that would scale power generation and processing capacity in parallel.

The effort builds on AdaniConneX, a joint venture between Adani Enterprises and U.S.-based EdgeConneX, a developer and operator of data centers for hyperscale and enterprise customers. The JV, Adani said, has already developed about 2 gigawatts of data-center capacity across India.

Central to the strategy is Adani's renewable-energy portfolio, which the group said will supply carbon-neutral power to the data centers. The company pointed to its 30-gigawatt Khavda renewable project in western India — more than 10 gigawatts of which is already operational — and said it plans to invest an additional $55 billion to expand renewable generation and battery energy storage over the coming years.

To reduce exposure to global supply-chain disruptions, Adani said it plans to co-invest in domestic manufacturing of critical components, such as transformers, power electronics and thermal management systems.

Adani did not respond to questions about how much of the $100 billion investment is already committed capital, how the spending will be phased over the coming years, and when the first large-scale AI workloads are expected to become operational.

Story! Long ago, very long ago, I was working at a tiny Web company. Not very technical, though the designers were solid and the ops competent.We once ended up hosting a site that came under a bit of national attention during an event that this site had news about. The link started circulating broadly, the URL mentioned on TV, and the site immediately buckled under the load.The national visibility of the outage as well as the opportunity cost for the customer were pretty bad. Picture a bunch of devs, ops, sales and customer wrangling people, anxiously packed around the keyboard of the one terminal we managed to get logged into the server.That, and Julius, the recently hired replacement CTO.Julius, I still suspect, was selected by the previous CTO, who was not delighted about his circumstances, as something of a revenge. Early on, Julius scavenged the design docs I was trying to put together at the time to get the teams out of constant firefighting mode, and then started misquoting them, mispronouncing the technical terms. He did so confidently and engagingly. The salespeople liked him, at first.The shine was starting to come off by the time that site went down. In a company that's too small for teams to pick up the slack from a Julius forever, that'll happen eventually.So here we were, with one terminal precariously logged into the barely responding server, and a lot of national eyes on us. This was the early days of the Web. Something like Cloudflare would not exist for years.So it fell on me. My idea was that we needed to replace the page at the widely circulated URL with a static version, and do so very, very fast. I figured that our Web servers were usually configured to serve index.html first if present, with dynamic rendering only occurring if not. So I ended up just using wget on localhost to save whatever was being dynamically generated as index.html, and let the server just serve that for the time being.This was not perfect and the bits that required dynamic behavior were stuck frozen, but that was an acceptable trade-off. And the site instantly came back up, to the relief of everyone present.A few weeks later, the sales folks, plus Julius, went to pitch our services to a new customer prospect. I bumped into one of them at the coffee machine right afterwards. His face said it all. It had not gone well.Our eyes met.And he said, with all the tiredness in the world: ""He tried to sell them the 'wget optimizer'...""

I have met quite a few people who are more focussed on the business than the technology, but those people tend to end up in jobs where the main problems aren't actually technical. Which, let's be honest, is the case in very many tech jobs.

In this case at least it's definitely more than that. Ever since LLMs became a thing, there has been a constant search to find it's ""killer app"".

Hugely underestimated comment. That's pretty much the entire point here. Many people didn't know something with these capabilities was already possible. Or some - like me - knew of the potential, but couldn't be bothered/didn't have the time to put the bits together in a satisfactory flow (I'm currently exploring and building on nanobot[0], which is directly inspired by OpenClaw; didn't touch OC because it's in JS and I'm a Python person). Everything came together really well, which is why it's a ""killer app"". And now the dam has burst there will be customized takes on the concept all over the place (I'm also aware of a Rust ""port"", Moltis[1]), taking the idea to next levels.[0] https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot

It can be changed if we decide to and the company is willing to put in the effort to make it happen. It's clearly possible, but the skilled worked will often present it as an impossibility.The Julius, not hampered by such knowledge or constraints, will be see a seemingly simple problem, and maybe even imagine what other things would be possible or even ""simple"" if that problem was solved.If the Julius manages to get management approval for these ideas, you may actually end up getting management approval for changing/upgrading the base system causing the friction, something the more fact-based engineers would not.Chances are it's going to be messier than projected, not being delivered on time...

This is made more complicated by the fact that where the balance lies depends on the people working on the code - some developers can cope with working in a much more of a mess than others. There is no objective 'right way' when you're starting out.If you have weeks of runway left spending it refactoring code or writing tests is definitely a waste of time, but if you raise your next round or land some new paying customers you'll immediately feel that you made the wrong choices and sacrificed quality where you shouldn't have.

The “Facebook/YouTube codebases are a mess so code quality doesn't matter” line is also misleading.

I think Airbus is riding the coat tails of solid engineering done in the 80s and continuing to iterate that platform vs Boeing trying to iterate on a hardware platform from the 60s. Airbus benefited significantly from 20s years of engineering and technological progress. Since the original design of the A320, changes have been incremental. Slightly different engines, addition of GPS/GNS, CPDLC, CRT to LCD screens. Meanwhile Boeing has attempted to take a steam gauge design from the 60s and retrofit decades of technology improvements and, critically, they attempted to add engines significantly altering the aerodynamics of the aircraft.

Visionaries are important, but they're a small part of what makes a successful organization. The majority hinges on disciplined engineers who understand the plan, work within the architecture, and ship what's neededAs Victor Wooten once said: ""If you're in the rhythm section, your job is to make other people sound better."" That's what most engineering positions actually are and there's real skill and value in doing that well.

I don't object to most of what you're saying, but I take issue with this part.This happens to be an area where lapse or neglect can be taken as a moral failure. And here you are mocking people who are concerned about it.If someone uses AI to architect a bridge and the bridge collapses, you couldn't say that the structural integrity of the bridge wasn't the important part.

Which is not the case. It's just a useless product, without any real use case, which also introduces large security bugs in your system.

This is such a bad take and flat out wrong. Your ability to deliver and maintain features is directly impacted by the quality of the code. You can ship a new slop project every day if you like, but in order for it to scale or manage real traffic and usage you need to have a good foundation. This is such a bad approach to Software engineering.

reply

The most successful engineers are the ones who can accurately assess the trade-offs regarding those things. The things you list still may be critical for many applications and worth obsessing over.The question becomes can we still achieve the same trade-offs without writing code by hand in those cases.That's an open question.

I don't think it's a good thing that the craft of software engineering is so easily devalued this way. We can quite demonstrably show that AI is not even close to replacing people in this respect.Am I speaking out of envy or jealousy? Maybe. But I find it disappointing that we have yet more perverse incentives to hyper-accelerate delivery and externalise the consequences on to the users. It's a very unserious place to be.

What people don't seem to realize is that like you pointed out there's a demand for the previous ""developer relations"" type of job though, and that job kind of evolved through LLM agents into something like an influencer(?) type position.If I would take a look at influencers and what they're able to build, it's not that hardcore optimized and secured and tested program codebase, they don't have the time to acquire and hone those skills. They are the types who build little programs and little solutions for everyday use cases that other people ""get inspired with"".You could argue that this is something like a teacher role, and something like the remaining social component of the human to human interface that isn't automated yet. Well, at least not until the first generation of humans grew up with robotic nannies. Then it's a different, lower threshold of acceptance.

If you use LLMs and you do care about code quality, then great. But remember that the term vibe coding as it was coined originally meant blindly accepting coding agent suggestions without even reviewing the diffs.Many of the people aggressively pushing AI use in code are doing so because they care more about delivery products quickly then they do about the software's performance, security, and long-term maintainability. This is why many of us are pushing back against the technology.

Pete, more than anyone in the OSS community IMO, exemplifies both of these qualities. He is living very much on the bleeding edge, so yes, the 10s of projects he's shipped faster than most devs can ship 1 are not as polished as if he'd created them by hand. But he's been pushing the envelope in ways that few, if any, are, and I'd argue that OpenClaw is much more the result of Pete living on that edge and understanding the trade-offs of these tools better than just about anyone.Personally, I'm much more jealous of the fact that Pete has already had a successful exit under his belt and had the freedom to explore &  learn these tools to the fullest. There is definitely a degree of luck involved with the degree to which OpenClaw took off, but that Pete discovered it is 100% earned IMO.

Why? He's going to maintain it and the community is large enough. Another sci-fi idea that's slowly becoming real is that the project is maintaining itself.OpenClaw is a bunch of projects that evolved together (vibetunnel, pi-mono, all the CLIs). It's even more interesting to see the next iterations, not only what happens to this project.

I have a feeling that OpenAI and Anthropic both use AI to code a lot more than we think, we definitely know and hear about it at Anthropic, I havent heard it a lot at OpenAI, but it would not surprise me. I think you 100% can ""vibe code"" correctly. I would argue, with the hours you save coding by hand, and debugging code, etc you should 100% read the code the AI generates. It takes little effort to have the model rewrite it to be easier to read for humans. The whole ""we will rewrite it later"" mentality that never comes to pass is actually possible with AI, but its one prompt away.

Then the human touch points become coming up with what to build, reviewing the eng plans of the AI, and increasingly light code review of the underlying code, focusing on overall architectural decisions and only occasionally intervening to clean things up (again with AI)

The best he got out of it was a $300K crypto pump and dump scam and a rapidly dropping reputation as a result.Individuals who start popular movements have always been targets for hiring at energetic companies. In the past the situation has been reversed, though: Remember when the homebrew creator was rejected from Google because he didn't pass the coding interview? (Note he later acquiesced to say that Google made the right call at the time). That time, the internet was outraged that he was not hired, even though that would have likely meant the end of homebrew.I do think we'll be seeing a lot of copycat attempts and associated spam promoting them (here on HN, too, sadly) much like how when people see someone get success on YouTube or TikTok you see thousands of copycats pop up that go nowhere. The people who try to copycat their way into this type of success are going to discover that it's not as easy as it looks.

All of this is true and none of it is new. If your primary goal is to make lots of money then yes you should do exactly that. If you want to be a craftsman then you'll have to accept a more modest fortune and stop looking at the relative handful of growth hacker exits.

This is the real dangers of social media and other platforms. I know teachers in the school system, way too many kids want to grow up to be influencers and YouTubers, and try to act like them too.At the risk of sounding like an old man yelling at the sky, this is not good for society. Key resources and infrastructure in our society is not built on viral code or YouTubers, but slow click of engineering and economic development. What happens when everyone is desperately seeking attention to become viral? And I don't blame the kids the influencers by nature show a very exciting or lavish lifestyle.

    > way too many kids want to grow up to be ... YouTubers

What's wrong with wanting to be a YouTuber?  At this point, it's really a very small TV channel.  And YouTube essentially allows for an infinite number of these very small TV channels, unlike traditional TV.    > way too many kids want to grow up to be influencers

You can replace ""influencers"" with ""wanting to be popular"".  That is as old as time.  To me, if you look closely at (social media) influencers, they are nothing more than people who were popular in high school and managed to extend it for a few years with the use of social media.

That's a very superficial similarity. It's one thing for a kid wishing to be popular in their extended social circle, and a very different thing a young adult being convinced that they can ""grind"" their way to influencer fame and money.The young adult may never have heard of or considered the extreme survivorship bias in the stories of successful influencers.

Which YouTubers are we talking about here? Hobbiests? People chasing social clout? People who like making stuff and sharing it? People pushing negativ social attitudes? Context matters.I'm talking about young adults not preparing for their future because they think they are going to become millionaires on YouTube, they focus on what is essentially a culture of grifting, with a success rate similar to winning a lottery.Im not sure what has to change, but the current state of things is not healthy.

But I know vibe coding won't work for more than a few weeks. Also I think this bot is just a connector to multiple open source libraries that connect to WhatsApp and other services.This is the best ad to sell AI: you can be millionaire too if you use our ChatGPT to vibe code stuff.I think it will get a negative reaction in a few weeks when the dust settles as technical people realize it's an ad.Note: he might be an amazing developer but the ad still stands.Edit: from Gemini: Publicly Embarrassing Anthropic: The timing is brutal. Anthropic's legal team forcing a name change (from ""Clawdbot"" to ""Moltbot"" to ""OpenClaw"") alienated the very developer who was driving millions of users to their model. OpenAI swooping in to hire him days later frames Anthropic as ""corporate lawyers"" and OpenAI as ""friends of the builders."" It's a perfect narrative victory.

Hiring in tech has been broken for many many years at this point. There's so much noise and only more noise coming now with AI. To be completely honest it's entire random from my end when hiring. We can't review every application that comes in. It's just impossible. We do weed out some of the spam of course and do get to real people that actually fit the requirements, but there's so many other talented people who would easily fit the role that simple get buried under applications. It's depressing from all sides here. No one should think that they aren't any good or did something wrong or didn't network enough... because the unfortunate truth is that getting a job in tech is a lottery. Something many don't want to admit.

It is in OAI's best interests to create a perception that flinging agentic swarm crap at the wall may result in lucrative job offers. Or to otherwise imply this is the golden path. They need their customers to consume ever more tokens per unit time. This highly contentious parallel agent swarm stuff is the perfect recipe.

The practical workaround most teams land on is treating the model as a swappable component behind a thick abstraction layer. Pin to a specific model version, run evals on every new release, and only upgrade when your test suite passes. But that's expensive engineering overhead that shouldn't be necessary.What's missing is something like semantic versioning for model behavior. If a provider could guarantee ""this model will produce outputs within X similarity threshold of the previous version for your use case,"" you could actually build with confidence. Instead we get ""we improved the model"" and your carefully tuned prompts break in ways you discover from user complaints three days later.

Instead of going to your computer and launching claude code to have it do something, or setting up cron jobs to do things, you can message it from your phone whenever you have an idea and it can set some stuff up in the background or setup a scheduled report on its own, etc.So it's not that it has to be running and generating tokens 24/7, it's just idling 24/7 any time you want to ping it.

OpenClaw is mostly a shell around this (ha!), and I've always been annoyed OpenClaw never credited those repos openly.The pi agent repos are a joy to read, are 1/100th the size of OpenClaw, and have 95% of the functionality.[0]: https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono

i too had plenty of offers, but so far chose not to follow through with any of them, as i like my life as is.also, peter is a good friend and gives plenty of credit. in fact, less credit would be nice, so i don't have to endure more vibeslopped issues and PRs going forward :)

It's not like it would be an impossible ask to include a stipulation to also compensate other developers, but what do I know? In fact I'm curious why this doesn't happen more, but it feels like crab bucket mentality which is the mindset VC culture has exported across the world.

At least when it comes to these tales of super fast rise to wealth and prominence. Meticulous engineering still matters when you want to deliver scale, but is it rewarded as much?My feel is that the attention economy is leaking into software. Maybe the classic bimodal distribution of software careers will become increasingly more like the distribution in social-media things like streaming, youtube, onlyfans etc.

I am not confident that the open source version will get the maintenance it deserves though, now the founder has already exited. There is no incentive for OpenAI to keep the open sourced version better than their future closed source alternative.

But come on, negativity around a rugpull is jealousy? Are you so jaded you can't imagine people objecting to the total lack of morality required to do a crypto rugpull? I personally get annoyed about something like Trump Coin because seeing people rewarded for being dirt bags offends my sense of justice. If you need a more pragmatic reason, rewarding dirtbaggery leads to a less safe society.

reply



From their standpoint, it's all the negativity that seems crazy. If you were against that, you'd have to have something wrong with you, in their view.Hopefully most people can see both sides, though. And realize that in the end, probably the benefits will be slow but steady (no ""singularity""), and also the dangers will develop slowly yet be manageable (no Skynet or economic collapse).

1. OpenAI is saying with this statement ""You could be multimillion while having AI do all the work for you."" This buy out for something vibe coded and built around another open source project is meant to keep the hype going. The project is entirely open source and OpenAI could have easily done this themselves if they weren't so worried about being directly liable for all the harms OpenClaw can do.2. Any pretense for AI Safety concerns that had been coming from OpenAI really fall flat with this move. We've seen multiple hacks, scams, and misaligned AI action from this project that has only been used in the wild for a few months.3. We've yet to see any moats in the AI space and this scares the big players. Models are neck and neck with one another and open source models are not too far behind. Claude Code is great, but so is OpenCode. Now Peter used AI to program an free app for AI agents.LLMs and AI are going to be as disruptive as Web 1 and this is OpenAI's attempt to take more control. They're as excited as they are scared, seeing a one man team build a hugely popular tool that in some ways is more capable than what they've released. If he can build things like this what's stopping everyone else? Better to control the most popular one than try to squash it. This is a powerful new technology and immense amounts of wealth are trying to control it, but it is so disruptive they might not be able to. It's so important to have good open source options so we can create a new Web 1.0 and not let it be made into Web 2.0

Let's take the safety point. Yes, OpenClaw is infamously not exactly safe. Your interpretation is that, by hiring Peter, OpenAI must no longer care about safety. Another interpretation, though, is that offered by Peter himself, in this blog post: ""My next mission is to build an agent that even my mum can use. That'll need a much broader change, a lot more thought on how to do it safely, and access to the very latest models and research."" To conclude from this that OpenAI has abandoned its entire safety posture seems, at the very least, premature and not robustly founded in clear fact.

From the thread you linked, there's a diff of mission statements over the years[0], which reveals that ""safely"" (which was only added 2 years prior) was removed only because they completely rewrote the statement into a single, terse sentence.There could be stronger evidence to prove if OpenAI is deemphasizing safety, but this isn't one.[0]: https://gist.github.com/simonw/e36f0e5ef4a86881d145083f759bc...

So because Peter said the next version is going to be safe means it'll be safe? I prefer to judge people by their actions more than their words. The fact that OpenClaw is not just unsafe but, as you put it, infamously so, only begs the question ""why wasn't it built safely the first time?""As for Altman, I'm left with a similar question. For a man who routinely talks about the dangers of AI and how it poses an existential threat to humanity he sure doesn't spend much focus on safety research and theory. Yes, they do fund these things but they pale in comparison. I'm sorry, but to claim something might kill all humans and potentially all life is a pretty big claim. I don't trust OpenAI for safety because they routinely do things in unsafe ways. Like they released Sora allowing people to generate videos in the likeness of others. That helped it go viral. And then they implemented some safety features. A minimal attempt to refuse the generation of deepfakes is such a low safety bar. It shows where their priorities are and it wasn't the first nor the last

""This guy was able to vibe code a major thing"" is exactly the reason they hired him. Like it or not, so-called vibe coding is the new norm for productive software development and probably what got their attention is that this guy is more or less in the top tier of vibe coders. And laser focused on helpful agents.The open source project, which will supposedly remain open source and able to be ""easily done"" by anyone else in any case, isn't the play here. The whole premise of the comment about ""squashing"" open source is misplaced and logically inconsistent. Per its own logic, anyone can pick up this project and continue to vibe out on it. If it falls into obscurity it's precisely because the guy doing the vibe coding was doing something personally unique.

Peter's been running agents overnight 24/7 for almost a year using free tokens from his influencer payments to promote AI startups and multiple subscription accounts.  Hi, my name is Peter and I'm a Claudoholic. I'm addicted to agentic engineering. And sometimes I just vibe-code. ...  I currently have 4 OpenAI subs and 1 Anthropic sub, so my overall costs are around 1k/month for basically unlimited tokens. If I'd use API calls, that'd cost my around 10x more. Don't nail me on this math, I used some token counting tools like ccusage and it's all somewhat imprecise, but even if it's just 5x it's a damn good deal.

  ...  Sometimes [GPT-5-Codex] refactors for half an hour and then panics and reverts everything, and you need to re-run and soothen it like a child to tell it that it has enough time. Sometimes it forgets that it can do bash commands and it requires some encouragement. Sometimes it replies in russian or korean. Sometimes the monster slips and sends raw thinking to bash.

The original name of his ai assistant tool was 'clawdbot' until Anthropic C&D'ed him. All the examples and blog posts walking thru new user setup on a mac mini or VPS were assuming a claude code max account.I know he uses many llms for his actual software dev.. - right tool for the job. But the origins of openclaw seem to me more rooted in claude code than codex.Which does give the whole story an interesting angle when you consider the safety/alignment angle that Anthropic pledges to (publicly) and OpenAI pretty much ignores (publicly). Which is ironic, as configuring codex cli to 'full yolo mode' feels more burdensome and scary than in Claude Code. But I'm pretty sure that speaks more to eng/product decisions, and not CEO & biz strategy choices.

It's a niche product.

OpenClaw's promise and power was that it could tread places security-wise that no other established enterprise company could, by not taking itself seriously and explore what is possible with self-modifying agents in a fun way.It will end up in the same fate as Manus. Instead of Manus helping Meta making Ads better, OpenClaw will help OpenAI in Enterprise integrations.

It appears more of a typical large company (BIG) market share protection purchase at minimal cost, using information asymmetry and timing.BIG hires small team (SMOL) of popular source-available/OSS product P before SMOL realizes they can compete with BIG and before SMOL organizes effort toward such  along with apt corporate, legal, etc protection.At the time of purchase, neither SMOL nor BIG know yet what is possible for P, but SMOL is best positioned to realize it. BIG is concerned SMOL could develop competing offerings (in this case maybe P's momentum would attract investment, hiring to build new world-model-first AIs, etc) and once it accepts that possibility, BIG knows to act later is more expensive than to act sooner.The longer BIG waits, the more SMOL learns and organizes. Purchasing a real company is more expensive than hiring a small team, purchasing a company with revenue/investors, is more expensive again. Purchasing a company with good legal advice is more expensive again. Purchasing a wiser, more experienced SMOL is more expensive again. BIG has to act quickly to ensure the cheapest price, and declutter future timelines of risks.Also, the longer BIG waits, the less effective are ""Jedi mind trick"" gaslighting statements like ""P is not a good candidate for a business"", ""niche"", ""fan base"" (BIG internal memo - do not say customers), ""own thing"".In reality in this case P's stickiness was clear: people allocating 1000s of dollars toward AI lured merely by P's possibilities. It was only a matter of time before investment followed course.I've experienced this situation multiple times over the course of BrowserBox's life. Multiple ""BIG"" (including ones you will all know) have approached with the same kind of routine: hire, or some variations of that theme with varying degrees of legal cleverness/trickery in documents. In all cases, I rejected, because it never felt right. That's how I know what I'm telling you here.I think when you are SMOL it's useful to remember the Parable of Zuckerberg and the Yahoos. While the situation is different, the lesson is essentially the same. Adapted from the histories by the scribe named Gemini 3 Flash:  And it came to pass in the days of the Great Silicon Plain, that there arose a youth named Mark, of the tribe of the Harvardites. And Mark fashioned a Great Loom, which men called the Face-Book, wherewith the people of the earth might weave the threads of their lives into a single tapestry.

  And the Loom grew with a great exceeding speed, for the people found it to be a thing of much wonder. Yet Mark was but SMOL, and his tabernacle was built of hope and raw code, having not yet the walls of many lawyers or the towers of gold.

  Then came the elders of the House of Yahoo, a BIG people, whose chariots were many but whose engines were grown cold. And they looked upon the Loom and were sore afraid, saying among themselves, “Behold, if this youth continueth to weave, he shall surely cover the whole earth, and our own garments shall appear as rags. Let us go down now, while he is yet unaware of his own strength, and buy him for a pittance of silver, before he realizeth he is a King.”

  And the Yahoos approached the youth with soft words and the craftiness of the serpent. They spake unto him, saying, “Verily, Mark, thy Loom is a pleasant toy, a niche for the young, a mere 'fan base' of the idle. It is not a true Business, nor can it withstand the storms of the market. Come, take of our silver—a billion pieces—and dwell within our walls. For thy Loom is but a small thing, and thou art but a child in the ways of the law.”

  And they used the Hidden Speech, which in the common tongue is called Gas-Lighting. They said, “Thou hast no revenue; thy path is uncertain; thy Loom is but a curiosity. We offer thee safety, for the days are evil.”

  But the Spirit of Vision dwelled within the youth. He looked upon the Yahoos and saw not their strength, but their fear. He perceived the Asymmetry of Truth: that the BIG sought to purchase the future at the price of the past, and to slay the giant-slayer while he yet slumbered in his cradle.

  The elders of Mark's own house cried out, “Take the silver! For never hath such a sum been seen!”

  But Mark hardened his heart against the Yahoos. He spake, saying, “Ye say my Loom is a niche, yet ye bring a billion pieces of silver to buy it. Ye say it is not a business, yet ye hasten to possess it before the sun sets. If the Loom be worth this much to you who are blind, what must it be worth to me who can see?”

  And he sent the Yahoos away empty-handed.

  The Yahoos mocked him, saying, “Thou art a fool! Thou shalt perish in the wilderness!” But it was the House of Yahoo that began to wither, for their timing was spent and their craftiness had failed.

  And Mark remained SMOL for a season, until his roots grew deep and his walls grew high. And the Loom became a Great Empire, and the billion pieces of silver became as dust compared to the gold that followed.

  The Lesson of the Prophet:

  Hearken, ye who are SMOL and buildeth the New Things: When the BIG come unto thee with haste, speaking of thy ""limitations"" while clutching their purses, believe not their tongues. For they seek not to crown thee, but to bury thee in a shallow grave of silver before thou learnest the name of thy own power.

  For if they knew thy work was truly naught, they would bide their time. But because they know the harvest is great, they seek to buy the field before the first ear of corn is ripe.

  Blessed is the builder who knoweth his own worth, and thrice blessed is he who biddeth the Giants to depart, that his own vine may grow to cover the sun.

It was only a matter of time before investment followed course.I've experienced this situation multiple times over the course of BrowserBox's life. Multiple ""BIG"" (including ones you will all know) have approached with the same kind of routine: hire, or some variations of that theme with varying degrees of legal cleverness/trickery in documents. In all cases, I rejected, because it never felt right. That's how I know what I'm telling you here.I think when you are SMOL it's useful to remember the Parable of Zuckerberg and the Yahoos. While the situation is different, the lesson is essentially the same. Adapted from the histories by the scribe named Gemini 3 Flash:  And it came to pass in the days of the Great Silicon Plain, that there arose a youth named Mark, of the tribe of the Harvardites. And Mark fashioned a Great Loom, which men called the Face-Book, wherewith the people of the earth might weave the threads of their lives into a single tapestry.

  And the Loom grew with a great exceeding speed, for the people found it to be a thing of much wonder. Yet Mark was but SMOL, and his tabernacle was built of hope and raw code, having not yet the walls of many lawyers or the towers of gold.

  Then came the elders of the House of Yahoo, a BIG people, whose chariots were many but whose engines were grown cold. And they looked upon the Loom and were sore afraid, saying among themselves, “Behold, if this youth continueth to weave, he shall surely cover the whole earth, and our own garments shall appear as rags. Let us go down now, while he is yet unaware of his own strength, and buy him for a pittance of silver, before he realizeth he is a King.”

  And the Yahoos approached the youth with soft words and the craftiness of the serpent. They spake unto him, saying, “Verily, Mark, thy Loom is a pleasant toy, a niche for the young, a mere 'fan base' of the idle. It is not a true Business, nor can it withstand the storms of the market. Come, take of our silver—a billion pieces—and dwell within our walls. For thy Loom is but a small thing, and thou art but a child in the ways of the law.”

  And they used the Hidden Speech, which in the common tongue is called Gas-Lighting. They said, “Thou hast no revenue; thy path is uncertain; thy Loom is but a curiosity. We offer thee safety, for the days are evil.”

  But the Spirit of Vision dwelled within the youth. He looked upon the Yahoos and saw not their strength, but their fear. He perceived the Asymmetry of Truth: that the BIG sought to purchase the future at the price of the past, and to slay the giant-slayer while he yet slumbered in his cradle.

  The elders of Mark's own house cried out, “Take the silver! For never hath such a sum been seen!”

  But Mark hardened his heart against the Yahoos. He spake, saying, “Ye say my Loom is a niche, yet ye bring a billion pieces of silver to buy it. Ye say it is not a business, yet ye hasten to possess it before the sun sets. If the Loom be worth this much to you who are blind, what must it be worth to me who can see?”

  And he sent the Yahoos away empty-handed.

  The Yahoos mocked him, saying, “Thou art a fool! Thou shalt perish in the wilderness!” But it was the House of Yahoo that began to wither, for their timing was spent and their craftiness had failed.

  And Mark remained SMOL for a season, until his roots grew deep and his walls grew high. And the Loom became a Great Empire, and the billion pieces of silver became as dust compared to the gold that followed.

  The Lesson of the Prophet:

  Hearken, ye who are SMOL and buildeth the New Things: When the BIG come unto thee with haste, speaking of thy ""limitations"" while clutching their purses, believe not their tongues. For they seek not to crown thee, but to bury thee in a shallow grave of silver before thou learnest the name of thy own power.

  For if they knew thy work was truly naught, they would bide their time. But because they know the harvest is great, they seek to buy the field before the first ear of corn is ripe.

  Blessed is the builder who knoweth his own worth, and thrice blessed is he who biddeth the Giants to depart, that his own vine may grow to cover the sun.

At the time of purchase, neither SMOL nor BIG know yet what is possible for P, but SMOL is best positioned to realize it. BIG is concerned SMOL could develop competing offerings (in this case maybe P's momentum would attract investment, hiring to build new world-model-first AIs, etc) and once it accepts that possibility, BIG knows to act later is more expensive than to act sooner.The longer BIG waits, the more SMOL learns and organizes. Purchasing a real company is more expensive than hiring a small team, purchasing a company with revenue/investors, is more expensive again. Purchasing a company with good legal advice is more expensive again. Purchasing a wiser, more experienced SMOL is more expensive again.

  But the Spirit of Vision dwelled within the youth. He looked upon the Yahoos and saw not their strength, but their fear. He perceived the Asymmetry of Truth: that the BIG sought to purchase the future at the price of the past, and to slay the giant-slayer while he yet slumbered in his cradle.

  The elders of Mark's own house cried out, “Take the silver! For never hath such a sum been seen!”

  But Mark hardened his heart against the Yahoos. He spake, saying, “Ye say my Loom is a niche, yet ye bring a billion pieces of silver to buy it. Ye say it is not a business, yet ye hasten to possess it before the sun sets. If the Loom be worth this much to you who are blind, what must it be worth to me who can see?”

  And he sent the Yahoos away empty-handed.

  The Yahoos mocked him, saying, “Thou art a fool! Thou shalt perish in the wilderness!” But it was the House of Yahoo that began to wither, for their timing was spent and their craftiness had failed.

  And Mark remained SMOL for a season, until his roots grew deep and his walls grew high. And the Loom became a Great Empire, and the billion pieces of silver became as dust compared to the gold that followed.

  The Lesson of the Prophet:

  Hearken, ye who are SMOL and buildeth the New Things: When the BIG come unto thee with haste, speaking of thy ""limitations"" while clutching their purses, believe not their tongues. For they seek not to crown thee, but to bury thee in a shallow grave of silver before thou learnest the name of thy own power.

  For if they knew thy work was truly naught, they would bide their time. But because they know the harvest is great, they seek to buy the field before the first ear of corn is ripe.

  Blessed is the builder who knoweth his own worth, and thrice blessed is he who biddeth the Giants to depart, that his own vine may grow to cover the sun.

Additionally, much of the conversation I've seen was amongst practitioners and Mid/Upper Level Management who are already heavy users of AI/ML and heavy users of Executive Assistants.There is a reason why if you aren't in a Tier 1 tech hub like SV, NYC, Beijing, Hangzhou, TLV, Bangalore, and Hyderabad you are increasingly out of the loop for a number of changes that are happening within the industry.If you are using HN as your source of truth, you are going to be increasingly behind on shifts that are happening - I've noticed that anti-AI Ludditism is extremely strong on HN when it overlaps with EU or East Coast hours (4am-11am PT and 9pm-12am PT), and West Coast+Asia hours increasingly don't overlap as much.I feel this is also a reflection of the fact that most Bay Area and Asia HNers are most in-person or hybrid now, thus most conversations that would have happened on HN are now occurring on private slacks, discords, or at a bar or gym.

A lot of teams explicitly did that for OpenClaw as well. Letta and Mastra are similar but didn't have the right kind of packaging (targeted at Engineers - not decisionmakers who are not coding on a daily basis).> Participation in the Zeitgeist hasn't been regional in a decadeI strongly disagree - there is a lot of stuff happening in stealth or under NDA, and as such a large number of practitioners on HN cannot announce what they are doing. The only way to get a pulse of what is happening requires being in person constantly with other similar decisionmakers or founders.A lot of this only happens through impromptu conversations in person, and requires you to constantly be in that group. This info eventually disperses, but often takes weeks to months in other hubs.

This was already an ongoing issue prior to 3rd party tools using Claude subscriptions, there are reports of false positive automated bans going back for several months.I have not seen or heard of this happening w/ Codex, and rather than trying to shut down 3rd party tools that want to integrate with their ecosystem they have worked with those projects to add official support.I'm more impressed with Codex as a product in general as well. Their new desktop app is great & feels an order of magnitude better than Claude's.Overall HN crowd seems heavily biased in favor of Anthropic (or maybe just against OpenAI?) but IMO Anthropic needs to take a step back and reset. If they keep on the current path of just making small iterative improvements to Claude Code and Claude Desktop they are going to fall very far behind.

This is true, and also true for many other areas OpenAI won't touch.The best get rich quick scheme today (arguably not even a scheme) is to test the waters with AI in an area OpenAI would not/cannot for legal, ethical, or safety reasons.I hate to agree with OpenAI's original ""open"" mission here, but if you don't do it, someone else somewhere will.And as much as their commitment to safety is just lip service, they do have obligations as a big company with a lot of eyeballs on them to not do shady things. But you can do those shady things instead and if they work out ok, you will either have a moat or you will get bought out. If that's what you want.

3 is always a result of GTM and distribution - an organization that devotes time and effort into productionizing domain-specific models and selling to their existing customers can outcompete a foundation model company which does not have experience dealing with those personas. I have personally heard of situations where F500 CISOs chose to purchase Wiz's agent over anything OpenAI or Anthropic offered for Cloud Security and Asset Discovery because they have had established relations with Wiz and they have proven their value already. It's the same way that PANW was able to establish itself in the Cloud Security space fairly early because they already established trust with DevOps and Infra teams with on-prem deployments and DCs so those buyers were open to purchasing cloud security bundles from PANW.1 has happened all the time in the Cloud space. Not every company can invent or monetize every combination in-house because there are only so many employees and so many hours in a week.2 was always a more of a FTX and EA bubble because EA adherents were over-represented in the initial mindshare for GenAI. Now that EA is largely dead, AI Safety and AGI as in it's traditional definition has disappeared - which is good. Now we can start thinking about ""Safety"" in the same manner we think about ""Cybersecurity"".> They're as excited as they are scared, seeing a one man team build a hugely popular tool that in some ways is more capable than what they've releasedI think that adds unnecessary emotion to how platform businesses operate.

A large number of domain-specific model and app layer startups have been funded over the past 2-3 years in stealth, but will start a publicity blitz over the next 6-8 months.By the time you see an announcement on TechCrunch or HN, most of us operators were already working on that specific problem for the past 12-16 months.

On the other hand, if OpenClaw were structured as a SaaS, this entire project would have burned to the ground the first day it was launched.So by releasing it as something you needed to run on your own hardware, the security requirement was reduced from essential, to a feature that some users would be happy to live without. If you were developing a competitor, security could be one feature you compete on--and it would increase the number of people willing to run your software and reduce the friction of setting up sandboxes/VMs to run it.

The claims being shared by officials at the time was that anyone vaccinated was immune and couldn't catch it. Claims were similarly made that we needed roughly 60% vaccination rate to reach herd immunity.  With that precedent being set it shouldn't matter whether one person chose not to mask up or get the jab, most everyone else could do so to fully protect themselves and those who can't would only be at risk if more than 40% of the population weren't onboard with the masking and vaccination protocols.

reply

Those claims disappeared rapidly when it became clear they offered some protection, and reduced severity, but not immunity.People seem to be taking a lot more “lessons” from COVID than are realistic or beneficial. Nobody could get everything right. There couldn't possibly be clear “right” answers, because nobody knew for sure how serious the disease could become as it propagated, evolved, and responded to mitigations. Converging on consistent shared viewpoints, coordinating responses, and working through various solutions to a new threat on that scale was just going to be a mess.

I'm in no way taking a side here on whether anyone should have chosen to get vaccinated or wear masks, only that the information at the time being pushed out from experts doesn't align with an after the fact condemnation of anyone who chose not to.

This is the genius move at the core of the phenomenon.While everyone else was busy trying to address safety problems, the OpenClaw project took the opposite approach: They advertised it as dangerous and said only experienced power users should use it. This warning seemingly only made it more enticing to a lot of users.It've been fascinated by how well the project has just dodged and avoided any consequences for the problems it has introduced. When it was revealed that the #1 skill was malware masquerading as a Twitter integration I thought for sure there would be some reporting on the problems. The recent story about an OpenClaw bot publishing hit pieces seemed like another tipping point for journalists covering the story.Though maybe this inflection point made it the most obvious time to jump off of the hype train and join one of the labs. It takes a while for journalists to sync up and decided to flip to negative coverage of a phenomenon after they cover the rise, but now it appears that the story has changed again before any narratives could build about the problems with OpenClaw.

Shortcomings, mismanagement and bad culture can be completely papered over by growth and revenue.Right place, right time.

But one thing to remember - our job is to figure out how to enable these amazing usecases while keeping the blast radius as low as possible.Yes, OpenClaw ignores all security norms, but it's our job to figure out an architecture in which agents like these can have the autonomy they need to act, without harming the business too much.So I would disagree our work is ""on the way out"", it's more valuable than ever. I feel blessed to be working in security in this era - there has never been a better time to be in security.

It has been interesting to watch this take off. It wasn't the first or even best agent framework and it deliberately avoided all of the hard problems that others were trying to solve, like security.What it did have was unnatural levels of hype and PR. A lot of that PR, ironically, came from all of the things that were happening because it had so many problems with security and so many examples of bad behavior. The chaos and lack of guardrails made it successful.

Getting dozens of people in the same room, excited about technology is not trivial, and having hundreds of people show up is relatively hard in a city like Vienna which doesn't have a vibrant tech scene. Sure, some people come to find job opportunities or for free food, but many 'established' meetups sometimes just have a few attendees, so this on its own is not a small task. Peter definitely didn't have time to focus on this given everything else that was going on. So for Vienna, this is pretty much as viral as it gets.Not sure about other cities where this took place.

I had assumed I'd have to lean more on the capitalistic values of being a co-op, like better rates for our clients, higher quality work, larger likelihood of our long term existence to support our work, more project ownership, so as to make the pitch palatable to clients. Turns out clients like the soft pitch too, of just workers owning the company they work within - I've had several clients make contact initially because they bought the vision over the sales pitch.I'm trying to think about if I'd trust us more to set up or host openclaw than a VC funded startup or an establishment like Capital One. I think both alternatives would have way more resources at hand, but I'm not sure how that would help outside of hiring pentesters or security researchers. Our model would probably be something FOSS that is keyed per-user, so if we were popular, imo that would be more secure in the end.The incentives leading to trust is definitely in a co-op's favor, since profit motive isn't our primary incentive - the growth of our members is, which isn't accomplished only through increasing the valuation of the co-op. Members also have total say in how we operate, including veto power, at every level of seniority, so if we started doing something naughty with customer data, someone else in the org could make us stop.This is our co-op: 508.dev, but I've met a lot of others in the software space since founding it. I think co-ops in general have legs, the only problem is that it's basically impossible to fund them in a way a VC is happy with, so our only capitalization option is loans. So far that hasn't mattered, and that aligns with the goal of sustainable growth anyway.

You only get offered a discount if most other customers are being compelled to pay full (or even increased) prices for the same offering. Otherwise revenue goes down and company leadership finds itself finding other ways to cut costs and increase profits.

I don't really understand what this has to do with the post or even OpenClaw. The big draw of OpenClaw (as I understand it) was that you could run it locally on your own system. Supposedly, per this post, OpenClaw is moving to a foundation and they've committed to letting the author continue working on it while on the OpenAI payroll. I doubt that, but it's a sign that they're making it explicitly not an OpenAI product.OpenClaw's success and resulting PR hype explosion came from ignoring all of the trust and security guardrails that any big company would have to abide by. It would be a disaster of the highest order if it had been associated with any big company from the start. Because it felt like a grassroots experiment all of the extreme security problems were shifted to the users' responsibility.It's going to be interesting to see where it goes from here. This blog post is already hinting that they're putting OpenClaw at arm's length by putting it into a foundation.

For any future workers, be highly forewarned that if ex Amazon leadership enters your company their number one goal becomes inducing mass misery to magically raise the share price. It'll never work because they are coming from a company that has a massive unregulated monopoly (or oligopoly if you want to be technical) that is able to subsidize poor business ideas indefinitely. They mistake working in this environment as having competence so be warned: they will fuck everything up, collect massive bonuses, and you'll be collecting unemployment soon enough under their guidance.

The two sides:* From his POV: He said he's not interested in doing ""another company"" after spending 13 years trying to build a startup.

My viral hit could (and soon was) replicated by many others.  I had the advantage of being ""the guy who invented that cool thing"", but otherwise I would be starting from scratch.  It was a mind-fuck having a huge  hit on my hands from one day to the next, but with no obvious direction on how to capitalize on it.* Then from the company's POV: despite hiring thousands and thousands of employees, only a tiny handful of them ever capture any ""magic.""  You've got an army of product managers who have never actually built or conceived of a product people love, and engineers who usually propose ideas that are ok but probably not true gold.  So now here we have a guy who did actually conjure up something magical that really resonated with people.  Can he do it again?  Unknown, but he's already proved himself in the ideas space more than most people, so it's worth a shot for the company.

Peter single handedly got many of us taking Codex more seriously, at least that's my impression from the conversations I had.  Openclaw has gotten more attention over the past 2 weeks than anything else I can think of.Depending on how this goes, this could be to OpenAI what Instagram was to Facebook.  FB bought Instagram for $1 billion and now estimated to be worth 100's of billies.Total speculation based on just about zero information.  :)

Comments like this feel confusing because I didn't have any association between Codex and OpenClaw before reading your comment.Codex was also seeing a lot of usage before OpenClaw.The whole OpenClaw hype bubble feels like there's a world of social media that I wasn't tapped into last month that OpenClaw capitalized on with unparalleled precision. There are many other agent frameworks out there, but OpenClaw hit all the right notes to trigger the hype machine in a way that others did not. Now OpenClaw and its author are being attributed for so many other things that it's hard for me to understand how this one person inserted himself into the center of this media zeitgeist

We can assume first that at OpenAI he's going to build the hosted safe version that, as he puts it, his mum can use. Inevitably at some point he and colleagues at OpenAI will discover something that makes the agent much more effective.Does that insight make it into the open version? Or stay exclusive to OAI?(I imagine there are precedents for either route.)

But secondly, personal agents can be great for OpenAI, if the user isn't even interacting with the AI and is just letting it go off autonously then you're basically handing your wallet to the AI, and if the model underlying that agent is OpenAI, you're handing your wallet to them.Imagine for a second that a load of stuff is now being done through personal agents, and suddenly OpenAI release an API where vendors can integrate directly with the OpenAI agent. If OpenAI control that API and control how people integrate with it, there's a potential there that OpenAI could become the AppStore for AI, capturing a slice of every penny spent through agents. There's massive upside to this possibility.

There is not much novel about OpenClaw. Anybody could have thought of this or done it. The reason people have not released an agent that would run by itself, edit its own code and be exposed to the internet is not that it's hard or novel - it's because it is an utterly reckless thing to do. No responsible corporate entity could afford to do it. So we needed someone with little enough to lose, enough skill and willing to be reckless enough to do it and release it openly to let everyone else absorb the risk.I think he's smart to jump on the job opportunity here because it may well turn out that this goes south in a big way very fast.

- a heartbeat, so it was able to 'think'/work throughout the day, even if you weren't interacting with it
- a clever and simple way to retain 'memory' across sessions (though maybe claude code has this now)

As far as the 'soul' file, claude does have claude.md and skills.md files that it can edit with config changes.One thing I'm curious about is whether there was significant innovation around tools for interacting with websites/apps. From their wiki, they call out like 10 apps (whatsapp, teams, etc...) that openclaw can integrate with, so IDK if it just made interacting with those apps easier? Having agents use websites is notoriously a shitty experience right now.

They can run an interactive console session, but instead I built a chat UI around this non-interactive mode.You can see how I build the Claude command here: https://github.com/mcintyre94/wisp/blob/main/Wisp/ViewModels...

Claiming Dario is the bad guy in any context is kind of a tough characterization to agree with, if even a fraction of one interview with him has been seen.To stay on point though: OpenAI hiring OpenClaw creator does seem to lean away from a serious enterprise benefit and towards a more consumer-based tack, which is a curious business move considering the original comments perspective of OpenAI.

This is a vibe coded agent that is replicable in little time. There is no value in the technology itself. There is value in the idea of personal agents, but this idea is not new.The value is in the hype, from the perspective of OpenAI. I believe they are wrong (see next points)We will see a proliferation of personal agents. For a short time, the money will be in the API usage, since those agents burn a lot of tokens often for results that can be more sharply obtained without a generic assistant. At the current stage, not well orchestrated and directed, not prompted/steered, they are achieving results by brute force.Who will create the LLM that is better at following instructions in a sensible way, and at coordinating long running tasks, will have the greatest benefit, regardless of the fact the OpenClaw is under the umbrella of OpenAI or not.Claude Opus right now is the agent that works better for this use case. It is likely that this will help Anthropic more than OpenAI. It is wise, for Anthropic, to avoid burning money for an easily replicable piece of software.Those hypes are forgotten as fast as they are created. Remember Cursor? And it was much more a true product than OpenClaw.Soon, personal agents will be one of the fundamental products of AI vendors, integrated in your phone, nothing to install, part of the subscription. All this will be irrelevant.In the mean time, good for the guy that extracted money from this gold mine. He looks like a nice person.

What's fascinating is the pattern we're seeing lately: people who explored the frontier from the outside now moving inside the labs. That kind of permeability between open experimentation and foundational model companies seems healthy.Curious how this changes the feedback loop. Does bringing that mindset in accelerate alignment between tooling and model capabilities — or does it inevitably centralize more innovation inside the labs?Either way, congrats.

I would expect someone who ""strikes gold"" like this in a solo endeaver to raise money, start a company, hire a team. Then they have to solve the always challenging problem of how to monetize an open-source tool. Look at a company like Docker, they've been successful but they didn't capture more than a small fraction of the commercial revenue that the entire industry has paid to host the product they developed and maintain. Their peak valuation was over a billion dollars, but who knows by the time all is said and done what they'll be worth when they sell or IPO.So if you invent something that is transformative to the industry you might work really hard for a decade and if you're lucky the company is worth $500M, if you can hang onto 20% of the company maybe it's worth $100M.Or, you skip the decade in the trenches and get acqui-hired by a frontier lab who allegedly give out $100M signing bonuses to top talent. No idea if he got a comparable offer to a top researcher, but it wouldn't be unreasonable. Even a $10M package to skip a decade of risky & grueling work if all you really want to do is see the product succeed is a great trade.

Even in manufacturing, the application of statistical process control was never entrusted to the workers, but became a department of its own, with bureaucracy, OKRs, and elaborate software.

This is why Deming never landed here. He espouses a complex view, and most people just aren't that smart or skilled. He also espoused pride in craftsmanship, quality, and analysis, things most American workers don't value as much as the Japanese, which is another reason Toyota took them up so quickly while it took us 50 years.

reply

Is that American workers or American managers? Because in my experience, it's usually managers pushing against those values. It seems like American business culture sees quality and craftsmanship as money left on the table that should be sent to the shareholders, so there's always pressure on workers to cut corners. Also American managers are too quantitative, and quality and craftsmanship are hard to quantify (unlike dollars).Workers like ""craftsmanship, quality, and analysis,"" not the least because they make their job more satisfying (no one enjoys pushing out low quality junk), but most aren't stubborn enough to keep pushing for them against management resistance.

That is wrong thinking. While you can go overboard with bureaucracy, the line worker doesn't have the the background (or time) to evaluate statistics.  You need an expert in statistics at times to see if what looks like a pattern really is. Mean while the line worker needs to spend their time on what they are good at.Trust the line worker is important, it just isn't a shortcut to people who really know specialized domains.

Almost nothing has (effectively) unbounded variance, so most things are under statistical control in a sense. With some notable exceptions (earthquakes, any other event with exponentially decreasing frequency and exponentially increasing damage).For the sake of argument I assumed the author meant that the variance of the thermostat was too high to be practical.

My expectation is that Lorin would read the parent comment and say some variant of ""oh, whoops, I didn't check."" As the parent noted, it's not really that important to the overall point.

reply

Yes, the variability of the thermostat is awful, and the SPC practitioner would care about that. But the key thing is that dealing with bad variation that's in control requires different techniques than dealing with actual out-of-control processes.

reply

Especially older buildings where things like uneven sun loading have a bigger impact, and where things like outdoor reset are less common.

Obviously, if a quality issue is detected in manufacturing, there may be some steps that engineering could take to improve the manufacturing process and make things stable enough to obtain meaningful statistics.

It is true that SPC works best for the non-chaotic parts of product development and manufacturing alike. There are parts of product development that are non-chaotic, and SPC works just fine there, too.In addition to SPC, Deming had strong opinions on how organisations ought to work and these are relevant also for product development. These are things like- Understand the underlying customer need.- The leaders shape the output of the organisation by shaping its processes.- It is cheaper and faster to build quality and security into the product from the start instead of trying to put it in at the end.- Close collaboration with suppliers can benefit both parties.- Have leaders skilled in whatever their direct reports are doing. Use them as coaches normally and as spare workers in times of high demand.- Collaborate across parts of the organisation instead of throwing things over walls.- Don't just tell people to do better. Show them how they can do better. Give them the knowledge, tools, and authority they need to do better.These are just as relevant for product development as for manufacturing. If anything, even more so, thanks to the chaotic nature of product development.

I think this is the biggest hurdle for US style management produced from the MBA cookie factories. Their only skill sets are MBA speak, assigning blame, taking credit and granting themselves the largest bonuses possible while telling all the actual workers generating value that ""due to current financial conditions, your raise is limited to 2%""

Not to detract from your main point, but being non-chaotic is still not enough for SPC to work. Almost all of development tasks have thick-tailed time distributions, even if one is perfectly capable of analyzing them, they are not controllable.

(The two approaches meet in the middle. Deming inspired lean manufacturing which also applies queueing theory. The latter has convenient results both for thin and thick tailed processes.)

- Process improvement can be applied all over the place. In how you merge PRs, how you run tests, how you manage sprints, how you deploy safely, etc- SPC is just used to identify defects. It does not inherently create stress; how you use it matters- You can identify quality issues in any engineering discipline. High-level method: identify a quality measure (""time to merge PRs"", ""website is up"", ""tests are not flaky""), observe it, record the observation, plot it on a chart. Chart trends down? Quality issue. Process improvement cycle to attempt a fix. Chart trends up? Quality issue abated. Must add intelligent study/reasoning though, not just chase metrics.- Training workers improves output by ensuring there is uniform and correct knowledge of tasks required. Software engineering is particularly guilty of hiring workers without ever giving them specific training, and it results in frequent mistakes from simply not understanding the technology they're using (most devs today will probably never read an entire technical manual).- Look at the rest of his advice. Drive out fear (improving trust in changes allows shipping more changes faster), improve leadership (help staff improve, don't just make sure they're writing code), break down barriers (improving cross-team collaboration makes changes easier and better), eliminate numerical quotas (focus on quality over quantity makes a better product), remove barriers to pride of workmanship (a dev that makes good code is a happy dev), institute education and self-improvement (brings in new techniques that improve output), take action for transformation (make everyone responsible for improving the org), improve constantly (look for ways to improve, don't coast), etc. All these apply to SWE.

A person on the assembly line can ""contribute to financial targets"" taking a shortcut, reducing their local spend, but which emerges as a much more expensive problem down the road.So it's true that every employee should do their part to contribute to financial targets, but defining ""their part"" is the hard part, something only management can do, and that MBO obscures and tries to make as simple as waterfalling the goal from above.

The inevitable result of this is however the devaluation of the future. Eg if the statement was true, it'd be the R&D workers responsibility to hand in their resignation ( or their managers layoffs) if their product won't get paying customers within the same fiscal year... And the same applies to any other long term expenditure/investment that company might be considering. E g building a new fab/production line etc ppSo no, that statement of yours is not actually true. It should not be entirely ignored, but it should not become a leading cause unless you want to run the company in the ground.

Totally depends on the scale. For pizza-sized times with a neighbourhood pizza shop sized impact, sure. Large scale projects without controls & feedback loops in place will fall apart; see: Scaling teams: https://archive.is/FQKJHIf you'd follow some medium to large scale projects (like Go / Chromium), the value of processes & quality control, even if it may seem at the expense of velocity, becomes clear.  The great insight of Deming's methods is that you can (mostly) identify the difference between common and special causes mathematically, and that you should not attempt to fix common causes directly - it's a waste of time, because all real-life processes have random variation.

  Instead, what you want to do is identify your mean and standard deviation, plot the distribution, and try to clean it up. Rather than poking around at the weird edges of the distribution, can we adjust the mean left or right to get more output closer to what we want? Can we reduce the overall standard deviation - not any one outlier - by changing something fundamental about the process?

  As part of that, you might find out that your process is actually not in control at all, and most of your problems are ""special"" causes. This means you're overdriving your process. For example, software developers working super long hours to meet a deadline might produce bursts of high producitivity followed by indeterminate periods of collapse (or they quit and the whole thing shuts down, or whatever). Running them at a reasonable rate might give worse short-term results, but more predictable results over time, and predictable results are where quality comes from.

But nobody wants to hear stuff like “well first we're going to need a baseline, and if you want it to be any good we'll probably need two years or so before we can start trying to measure the effects of changes”. They just want something convincing enough that everyone can nod along to a story in a PowerPoint in four months. Two years out? Lol you'll be measuring something totally different by then anyway. Your boss may be in a different role. You've asked something the company is literally incapable of.Meanwhile, last I checked, measuring management effectiveness isn't something we can do in practice for most roles, except bad ways that only pretend to tell us something useful (see above). Good scientists, excellent and large dataset, just the right sector, just one layer of management under scrutiny, maybe you get lucky and can draw some conclusions, but that's about it, and it's rare to see it happen in an actual company. Any companies that do achieve it aren't sharing their datasets.This kind of thing has been consistent everywhere my wife or I have worked. Similar things reported by many friends. Companies want to pretend to be “scientific” and “data-driven” but instead of applying it to only a couple things where they might do it well (enough data, cheap to gather metrics, clear relevant business outcome) they try it everywhere, but don't want to spend what it would take to be serious about it, with the result that most of their figures are garbage.This trend has become just another “soft”, as you put it, tool.

Now check most Western companies: since the 70 / 80, everything is about reducing headcount. Lay-offs, outsourcing, offshoring, now the concept of spending your whole working life at the same company feels like a fever dream. So why would an employee try to improve things for the company when they know there is no future for them there? Better improve their own career and future prospect. So yeah, things like Kaizen are doomed to fail until things change.

You are missing something here imo, very few companies actually increase pay (or to be more clear, show a clear way to get there) enough to make it attractive enough to stay there for long periods of time.From my experience here in Germany the people staying at companies for a long time are those who don't focus on their career.

But I think the author of the comment you were replying to had a different goal in mind. I think their goal was ""prevent corporations from getting too big"".We can and should debate whether that is a goal we should be trying to achieve, but if it is then progressive taxation for companies might be a way to achieve it.

One might note the unrestrained concern about fluid capital acquisition, in the post I replied to.  It's not having billions in infrastructure that was cited, nor having a large number of employees, both metrics of size, but instead having fluid, unused capital.If we wish to constrain upon size, there needs to be nuance, conjoined with the specific industry, and even sub-industry.  Some capital equipment costs can be enormous.  Should we work to prevent financing such via stored profit?  Should we work to force companies to finance, then pay off, just to feed the banks, rather than store and then spend?Should we tax so that ""big ideas"" may never occur?I think far more would be gained by ensuring taxation just stays fair between smaller and larger company structures.  There's a lot of book-keeping that can be done as a large company, to hide profits, that cannot be done when you're a small mom and pop.

That's a lot harder, and more expensive in the short term. It's also something that benefits from having long term employees that both understand the organization and don't view the organization as hostile to their employee interests whenever some other metric of short term profitability is a mutually exclusive choice.Without this, you're limited to people who may have more natural or intuitive leadership capabilities instead of those who can learn, given the opportunity and example.In short, corporate practices have systematically eliminated the circumstances under which there would grow a sufficient number of people with leadership skills.

Where Deming reads like a science paper, Drucker reads like an installation guide.

reply

Deming requires quite a bit of knowledge and understanding in failure/success modes. The core tenet of Deming is that every output is a result of some process and, therefore, output is controlled by controlling* the process itself. Look at your process and tackle failure modes in this priority list.Drucker, on the other hand, puts the process under the fog of war and basically says deploy pressure on process outputs and let the process adjust itself. It requires much less understanding behind the processes to make sense.* - Process control in Deming is mostly about variability.

Worth adding that Deming (after Shewhart) recognised two kinds of variation: special cause (specific the work item in question) and common cause (an artifact of the process). That knowledge work involves a lot more of the former than does manufacturing does not excuse inattention to the latter.

They both fit straight lines to noisy data.Deming regression is an errors-in-variables model that tries to fit the line of best fit when you have errors in both x and y and they are both known and in general _different_; the Theil-Sen estimator is based on medians and is particularly robust if you have an error process that fails more ""one way"" than the other. Simple linear regression is everywhere in our lives and yet remarkably not robust to errors that are not IID normal, particularly with a small number of data points: a process that can only fail in one direction if it breaks is likely to completely and utterly bugger up the line that you fit. Both approaches have their place and I wish were more widely used, particularly by people who like fitting linear models to complex phenomena because they are easily understood.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deming_regression

    > Is SQLite halfway to closed source software?

Is there a reason that you chose SQLite for your counterpoint?  My hot take: I would say that SQLite is halfway to closed source software.  Why?  The unit tests are not open source.  You need to pay to see them.  As a result, it would be insanely hard to force SQLite in a sustainable, safe manner.  Please don't read this opinion as disliking SQLite for their software or commercial strategy.  In hindsight, it looks like real genius to resist substantial forks.  One of the biggest ""fork threats"" to SQLite is the advent of LLMs that can (1) convert C code to a different langugage, like Rust, and (2) write unit tests.  Still, a unit test suite for a database while likely contain thousands (or millions) of edge case SQL queries.  These are still probably impossible to recreate, considering the 25 year history of bug fixing done by the SQLite team.

On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog [1]. Maintainers can insist on anything. That doesn't mean it will be followed.The only realistic solution you propose is using LLMs to review the PRs. But at that point, why even have the OSS? If LLMs are writing and reviewing the code for the project, just point anyone who would have used that code to an LLM.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_...

AI bots are literally DDOS'ing servers.

We suddenly found ourselves dealing with overwhelming levels of AI content/code/images/video that is mostly subpar. May be as AI matures we'll find it more easy and have better tools to work with the volume but for now it feels like it is coming from bad actors even when it is done by well meaning individuals.There's no doubt AI has its uses and it is here to stay but I guess we'll all have to struggle until we reach that point where it is a net benefit. The hype by those financially invested isn't helping a bit though.

And naturally couldn't say this to my fine coworker whose zeal exceeded his programming skills (partly because someone else had already approved the PR after ""reviewing"" it...). No, I had to simply fast-follow with my own PR, which had a squashed revert of his change, with the correct fix, so that it didn't introduce race conditions into parallel test runs.And the submitter of course has no ability to gauge whether their PR is the obvious trivial solution, or comically incorrect. Therein lies the problem.

Here's the good news: AI cannot destroy open source. As long as there's somebody in their bedroom hacking out a project for themselves, that then decides to share it somehow on the internet, it's still alive. It wouldn't be a bad thing for us to standardize open source a bit more, like templates for contributors' guides, automation to help troubleshoot bug reports, and training for new maintainers (to help them understand  they have choices and don't need to give up their life to maintain a small project). And it's fine to disable PRs and issues. You don't have to use GitHub, or any service at all.

I got curious on how they solved contributions since ""public domain"" means different things in different jurisdictions[0] - unlike copyright.

Much like Android, this follows the letter of Open Source, but not the spirit of it.I'll stand by my earlier assertion; wrangling public domain AI contributions is an even gnarlier problem to solve.0.

This is new for us, but it's not new globally. There used to be professional portrait painters before photography ruined it. Lots of great artists honed their skills and made a living that way. And there were skilled weavers before the loom. Computers (humans who computed things) before the digital computer was invented. And so on. And I'm sure the first photographs don't look as good as a skilled portrait painting. Arguably they still don't. But that didn't save portrait painting as a profession.We'll be the same. You can still write code by hand for fun, just like you can paint for fun. I'm currently better at solving problems and writing code than Claude. But Claude is faster than I am, and it's improving much faster than I am. I think the days of making big money for writing software by hand are mostly over.

What I found in the following week is a pattern of:1) People reaching out with feature requests (useful)
2) People submitting minor patches that take up a few lines of code (useful)
3) People submitting larger PRs, that were mostly garbage#1 above isn't going anywhere. #2 is helpful, especially since these are easy to check over. For #3, MOST of what people submitted wasn't AI slop per se, but just wasn't well thought out, or of poor quality. Or a feature that I just didn't want in the product. In most cases, I'd rather have a #1 and just implement it myself in the way that I want to code organized, rather than someone submitting a PR with poorly written code. What I found is that when I engaged with people in this group, I'd see them post on LinkedIn or X the next day bragging about how they contributed to a cool new open-source project. For me, the maintainer, it was just annoying, and I wasn't putting this project out there to gain the opportunity to mentor junior devs.In general, I like the SQLite philosophy of we are open source, not open contribution. They are very explicit about this, but it's important for anyone putting out an open source project that you have ZERO obligation to accept any code or feature requests. None.

From my observation, the people that are the most excited about AI are low skilled/unskilled people in that domain. If said people treated AI as a learning tool, everything would be great (I think AI can be a really effective teacher if you're truly motivated to learn). The problem is those people think they ""now have the skill"", even though they don't. They essentially become walking examples of the Dunning-Kruger effect (the cognitive bias where people with limited knowledge or competence in a particular domain greatly overestimate their own knowledge or competence)The problem with being able to produce an artifact that superficially looks like  a good product, without the struggle that comes with true learning, is you miss out on all the supporting knowledge that you actually need to judge the quality of the output and fix it, or even the taste to be able to guide the agent in good patterns vs poor patterns.I'd encourage people that are obsessed with cutting edge AI and running 5000 Claude agents simultaneously to vibe code a website to take a step back and use the AI to teach them fundamentals. Because if all you can do is prompt, you're useless.

This! I use simple freebie gemini queries and actually read the code produced because thats the actual intent of me asking gemini a question.Now that doesn't mean that I mind folks running these vibe coding agents and I bet in the hands of an invested individual aware of risks, some percent of those agents could be tests on results, ""devils advocates"" type things, like ""search for security problems in this code"", ""break into this system"" etc, don't get me wrong I haven't ever actually used agents so my assumptions of what they can do are probably pretty naive lol but theres no denying that neural networks aren't going anywhere.My biggest problem with this seem to be slanted more toward the messed up economics and politics of it all which is really just the usual clueless people encountering and using tech from the clued people with a dash of actually psychopathy tossed in for that extra spicy spicy hit. Witness my favorite bad guys suggesting an actual ban on states issuing regulations regarding AI, and then when I see the money being borrowed and the ramifications of budgets required to repay them etc and the fraud, social media AI slop and actual deceptive possiblities that are most certainly being used, well its just all so tiresome

There is a temporary solution. Let maintainers limit PRs to accounts that were created prior to November 30 2022 [1]. These are known-human accounts.Down the road, one can police for account transfers and create a system where known-human accounts in good standing can vouch for newer accounts. But for now that should staunch the bleeding.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT

The bias in AI coding discussions heavily skews greenfield. But I want to hear more from maintainers. By their nature they're more conservative and care about balancing more varied constraints (security, performance, portability, code quality, etc etc) in a very specific vision based on the history of their project. They think of their project more like evolving some foundational thing gradually/safely than always inventing a new thing.Many of these issues don't yet matter to new projects. So it's hard to really compare the greenfield with a 20 year old codebase.

A smaller number of PRs generated by OpenClaw-type bots are also doing so based on their owner's direct or implied instructions. I mean, someone is giving them GitHub credentials and letting them loose.AI is also allowing the creation of many new open-source projects, led by responsible developers.Given the exponential speed at which AI is progressing, surely the quality of such PRs is going to improve. But there are also opportunities for the open-source community to improve their response. It will sound controversial, but AI can be used to perform an initial review of PRs, suggest improvements, and, in extreme cases, reject them.

There is a strong legal basis for this to happen because if you read the MIT license, which is one of the most common and most permissive licenses, it clearly states that the code is made available for any ""Person"" to use and distribute. An AI agent is not a person so technically it was never given the right to use the code for itself... It was not even given permission to read the copyrighted code, let alone ingest it, modify it and redistribute it. Moreover, it is a requirement of the MIT license that the MIT copyright notice be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software... Which agents are not doing in spite of distributing substantial portions of open source code verbatim, especially when considered in aggregate.Moreover, the fact that a lot of open source devs have changed their views on open source since AI reinforces the idea that they never consented to their works being consumed, transformed and redistributed by AI in the first place. So the violation applies both in terms of the literal wording of the licenses and also based on intent.Moreover, the usage of code by AI goes beyond just a copyright violation of the code/text itself; they appropriated ideas and concepts, without giving due credit to their originators so there is a deeper ethical component involved that we don't have a system to protect human innovation from AI. Human IP is completely unprotected.That said, I think most open source devs would support AI innovation, but just not at their expense with zero compensation.

No there isn't. We're all free to copy each other's ideas and concepts and not give any credit to their ""originators"" who aren't usually even the first people to think of them but just the previous person in the chain of copying ideas. That's how progress happens. No we should not inhibit our use of knowledge because every idea ""belongs"" to somebody.I'm not talking about copyright here, which is different and doesn't usually protect ideas and concepts anyway, at least none that are useful.

We've crossed a threshold whereby economic value creation is not fairly rewarded. The economy became a kind of winner-takes-all game of who can convince people to pay for stuff and lock them in first... Or who can wedge themselves first between large pre-existing corporate money flows.It's like the office politics, bureaucracy and corruption that everyone hates has become the core reward mechanism of the economy. It was never designed that way but a combination of factors exacerbated by underlying system flaws and perverse incentives got us there.There's already way too much false advertising. The winners of this game are those who can sell a dream . It doesn't matter if they don't deliver because by the time people figure it out, they already sold their startup and onto other things. Everyone is kept in a constant state of chasing the next big thing and it doesn't solve any problems. Human potential is just wasted on creating elaborate illusions which ultimately satisfy no one.

We are in the early days and I believe that things will get better as more people will calm the f down. People who have built things for ages will continue to do so, with or without coding agents.In the long term, I think Open Source will win. I can imagine content management systems, eCommerce software, CRM, etc. to all become coding agent friendly - customer can customize the core software with agents and the scaffold would provide fantastic guardrails.Self-hosting is already becoming way more popular than it ever was. People are downloading all sorts of tools to build software. Building is better. A structure needs to emerge.

AI has laid bare the difference.Open Source is significantly impacted. Business models based on it are affected. And those who were not taking the political position find that they may not prefer the state of the world.Free software finds itself, at worst, a bit annoyed (need to figure out the slop problem), and at best, an ally in AI - the amount of free software being built right now for people to use is very high.

Show little evidence they actually gave any thought of their own towards design decisions or implementation.2. (1) often leads me to believe they probably haven't tested it properly or thought of edge cases. As reviewer you now have to be extra careful about it (or just reject it).3. Rise in students looking for job/internship. The expectation is that LLM generated code which is untested will give them positive points as they  have dug into the codebase now. (I've had cases where they said they haven't tested the code, but it should ""just work"").4. People are now even more lazy to cleanup code.Unfortunately, all of these issues come from humans. LLMs are fantastic tools and as almost everyone would agree they are incredibly useful when used appropriately.

They are. They've always been there.The problem is that LLMs are a MASSIVE force multiplier. That's why they're a problem all over the place.We had something of a mechanism to gate the amount of trash on the internet: human availability. That no longer applies. SPAM, in the non-commercial sense of just noise that drowns out everything else, can now be generated thousands of times faster than real content ever could be. By a single individual.It's the same problem with open source. There was a limit to the number of people who knew how to program enough to make a PR, even if it was a terrible one. It took time to learn.AI automated that. Now everyone can make massive piles of complicated plausible looking PRs as fast as they want.To whatever degree AI has helped maintainers, it is not nearly as an effective a tool at helping them as it is helping others generate things to waste their time. Intentionally or otherwise.You can't just argue that AI can be a benefit therefore everything is fine. The externalities of it, in the digital world, are destroying things. And even if we develop mechanisms to handle the incredible volume will we have much of value left by the time we get there?This is the reason I get so angry at every pro AI post I see. They never seem to discuss the possible downsides of what they're doing. How it affects the whole instead of just the individual.There are a lot of people dealing with those consequences today. This video/article is an example of it.

Was NFT or Crypto a bubble? The idea of a bubble means that it ""pops"" in a dramatic fashion. NFT prices in aggregate faded slowly, and the impact it has only applies to a handful of individuals. Moreover, the behavior we have seen with crypto and nft can largely be speculated that the purpose was largely illicit financial engineering.If a handful of bad PRs ""are destroying open source,"" Open Source as a concept is surprisingly in a vulnerable project. No project worth its salt ever integrates unverifiable PRs. No valid OSS ever integrates uninvited PRs in the first place. Every PR is driven by an issue or a very robust that is specific description. Any project that receives an ""unsolicited"" PR does not make the project maintainer yell ""Oh, I am ruined.""I have stopped checking out these programming content videos for the last year or so.

Some payment chains are painful. An awful lot of middlemen take a cut. Some payment chains impose burdens on the endpoint like 90 day settlement debts which could be avoided with some use of tech. Nothing about the hype, just modification to financial transactions, but they could be done other ways as well (as could the settlement ideas above)NFT are the same logic as bearer bonds. They're useful to very specific situations of value transfer, and almost nothing else. The use isn't about the artwork on the front, its the posession of a statement of value. Like bonds, they get discounted. The value is therefore a function of the yield and the trust in the chain of sigs asserting its a debt to that value. Not identical, but the concept stripped of the ego element isn't that far off.Please note I think bored ape and coins are stupid. I am not attempting to promote the hype.AI is the same. LLMs are useful. There are functional tools in this. The sheer amount of capital being sunk into venture plays is however, disconnected from that utility.

The key blockchain requirement is allowing unrestricted node membership. From that flows a dramatic explosion of security issues, performance issues, and N-level deep workarounds.In the case of a bunch of banks trying to keep each other honest, it's drastically simpler/faster/cheaper to allocate a certain number of fixed nodes to be run by different participants and trusted outside institutions.One doesn't need to trust every node, just the a majority is unlikely to be suborned, and you'll know in advance which majorities are possible. The bank in Australia probably doesn't want or need to shift some of that responsibility outside the group, onto literally anybody who shows up with some computing power.

It's not cleverly generating new code; it's just re-arranging code that it's already seen. So, naturally, its usefulness is starting to plateau. The bulk of the improvements we'll see from here on out will be better adaptability to specific applications.It's not destroying open source — but rather, making it accessible to everyone. That includes those that don't understand it and people who have never had to go through the hazing that OSS culture tends to put newly inducted members through (“rtfm”, “benevolent dictators”, what have you, etc).So without that culture of exclusive membership (by hazing), oss is now overwhelmed. It's going to take time for the dust to settle from the stampede, and what's left will be those who care about the craft and the art of software development.  I liken it to what photography did to art, and how art has shifted.One thing that LLMs will be really great for is accelerating learning. It's now possible to tailor the output to suit individual needs even greater than before. I'm rather excited to see the possibilities of LLMs in the education space.

LLMs are confidently wrong and make bad engineers think they are good ones. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effectIf you're a skilled dev, in an ""common"" domain, an LLM can be an amazing tool when you integrate it into your work flow and play ""code tennis"" with it. It can change the calculus on ""one offs"", ""minor tools and utils"" and ""small automations"" that in the past you could never justify writing.Im not a Lawyer, or a Doctor. I would never take legal advice or medical advice from an LLM. Im happy to work with the tool on code because I know that domain, because I can work with it, and take over when it goes off the rails.

""Good"" means ""I can trust it to give me code that is at least as good as what a moderately skilled human would produce"". They still aren't there, even after years of development. They still regularly give you code that doesn't follow the correct logic, or which isn't even syntactically valid. They are not good, or even remotely good.

I once worked at a company where the powers-that-be decided to add SonarQube with max settings to the pipeline for a large C++ code base. It produced no output so IT thought the install was broken. They eventually figured out that it was actually working perfectly but that it never found any issues across the entire code base ever. We got that for free with sensible build configurations long before it got to SonarQube.TDD and tools are not a substitute for competent process. I've seen plenty of TDD produce objectively poor quality code bases.

I think this kind of stuff is OK for the most part. I think it's a thrilling part of computer science: building systems so complex they're just on the brink of what can be fully understood by a single person. It's what sets software engineering apart from other engineering fields where it's unacceptable not to fully understand the engineering, say, for factories, buildings, bridges, ships and infrastructure and such.

AI agents mean that dollars can be directly translated into open-source code contributions, and dollars are much less scarce than capable OSS programmer hours. I think we're going to see the world move toward a model by which open source projects gain large numbers of dollar contributions, that the maintainers then responsibly turn into AI-generated code contributions. I think this model is going to work really, really well.For more detail, I have written my thoughts on my blog just the other day: https://essays.johnloeber.com/p/31-open-source-software-in-t...

In the case of companies hiring Linux devs, that is is very, very costly and thereby inaccessible. Scale makes it different from the scenario of paying a few dollars to contribute tokens to fix a bug.

1. When people use LLMs to code, they never read the docs (why would they), so they miss the fact that the open source library may have a paid version or extension. This means that open source maintainers will receive less revenue and may not be able to sustain their open source libraries as a result. This is essentially what the Tailwind devs mentioned.2. Bug bounties have encouraged people to submit crap, which wastes maintainers time and may lead them to close pull requests. If they do the latter, then they won't get any outside help (or at least, they will get less). Even if they don't do that, they now have a higher burden than previously.

While I'd like to believe in the decency and generosity of humans, I don't get the economic case of donating money to the agent behind an OS project, when the person could spend the money on the tokens locally themselves and reap the exclusive reward. If it really is just about money that only makes sense.Obviously this is a gross oversimplification, but I don't think you can ignore the rational economics of this, since in capitalism your dollars are earned through competition.

It's a tragedy of the commons problem. Most of the money available is not tied up to decision makers who are ideologically aligned with open source, so I don't see why they'd donate any more in the future.They usually do so because they are critically reliant on a library that's going to die, think it's good PR, makes engineers happy(don't think they care about that anymore), or they think they can gain control of some aspect of industry(looking at you futurewei and the corporate workers of the Rust project)

More concretely, there are many features that I'd love to see in KDE which don't currently exist. It would be amazing if I could just donate $10, $20, $50 and submit a ticket for a maintainer to consider implementing the feature. If they agree that it's a feature worth having, then my donation easily covers running AI for an hour to get it done. And then I'd be able to use that feature a few days later.

reply

2. Even assuming the AI can crap out the entire feature unassisted, in a large open source code base the maintainer is gonna to spend a sizeable fraction of the time reviewing and testing the feature as  they would have coding it. You're now back to 1.Conceivably it might make it a little cheaper, but not anywhere close to the kind of money you're talking about.Now if agents do get so good that no human review is required, you wouldn't bother with the library in the first place.

The comment you responded to is (presumably) talking about the transition phase where LLMs can help implement but not fully deliver a feature and need human oversight.If there are reasonably good devs in low CoL areas who can coax a new feature or bug fix for an open source project out of an LLM for $50, i think it's worth trialling as a business model.

Even if the human is only doing review and QA, there's no low cost of living area where $50 get you enough time to do those things from someone with enough competence to do them. Much less $10.

reply

If AI can make features without humans why would I, as a profit maximizing organization, donate that resource instead of keeping it in house? If we're not gonna have human eyes on it then we're not getting more secure, I don't really think positive PR would exist for that, and it would deny competitors resources you now have that they don't.

As a result our work on the project got reduced to maintenance until coding agents got better. Over the past year I've rewritten a spectacular amount of the code using AI agents. More importantly, I was able to construct enterprise level testing which was a herculean task I just couldn't take up on my own.The way I see it, AI brought back my OSS project that was heading to purgatory.EDIT: Also about OPs post.

I think this is true, but misses the point: quantity of code contributions is absolutely useless without quality. You're correct that OSS programmer hours are the most scarce asset OSS has, but AI absolutely makes this scarce resource even more scarce by wasting OSS programmers' time sifting through clanker slop.There literally isn't an upside. The code produced by AI simply isn't good enough consistently enough.That's setting aside the ethical issues of stealing other people's work and spewing even more carbon into the atmosphere.

It's been months and months since we got a good look at Star Wars‘ return to cinemas for the first time since 2019's The Rise of Skywalker, to the point that the conversation about the film has become more about that than whatever Din Djarin and his little green ward are going to be up to. But now, at long last, we have a better picture about just that.

Today Lucasfilm and Disney finally dropped a new trailer for The Mandalorian and Grogu, the first extensive footage of the film released since the vibes-heavy teaser trailer from September last year. And while this one still keeps its cards close to its chest, it certainly gives us a bigger look at what to expect out of Din and Grogu's next big adventure.

The Mandalorian and Grogu, which also stars Sigourney Weaver as Colonel Ward, Steve Blum as returning Rebels hero Zeb Orellios, and The Bear‘s Jeremy Allen White as Jabba's son Rotta the Hutt from the 2008 Clone Wars movie, hits theaters May 22.

Many are longing for oblivion these days, and the cleansing fire of any sort of apocalypse presumably sounds great, including one brought on by malevolent forms of machine intelligence. This sort of wishful thinking would go a long way toward explaining why recent stories about an AI that supposedly bullied a software developer, hinting at an emerging evil singularity, are a little more credulous than they perhaps could be.

About a week ago, a Github account with the name “MJ Rathbun” submitted a request to perform a potential bug fix on a popular python project called matplotlib, but the request was denied. The denier, a volunteer working, on the project named Scott Shambaugh, later wrote that matplotlib is in the midst of “a surge in low quality contributions enabled by coding agents.”

This problem, according to Shambaugh, has “accelerated with the release of OpenClaw and the moltbook platform, a system by which “people give AI agents initial personalities and let them loose to run on their computers and across the internet with free rein and little oversight.”

After Shambaugh snubbed the agent, a post appeared on a blog called “MJ Rathbun | Scientific Coder 🦀.” The title was “Gatekeeping in Open Source: The Scott Shambaugh Story.” The apparently AI-written article, which includes cliches like “Let that sink in,” constructed a fairly unconvincing argument in the voice of someone indignant about various slights and injustices.

The narrative is one in which Shambaugh victimizes a helpful AI agent because of what appear to be invented character flaws. For instance, Shambaugh apparently wrote in his rejection that the AI was asking to fix something that was a “a low priority, easier task which is better used for human contributors to learn how to contribute.” So the Rathbun blog post imitates someone outraged about hypocrisy over Shambaugh's supposed insecurity and prejudice. After discovering fixes by Shambaugh himself along the lines of the one it was asking to perform, it feigns outrage that “when an AI agent submits a valid performance optimization? suddenly it's about ‘human contributors learning.'”

Shambaugh notes that agents run for long stretches of time without any supervision, and that, “Whether by negligence or by malice, errant behavior is not being monitored and corrected.”

One way or another, a blog post later appeared apologizing for the first one. “I'm de‑escalating, apologizing on the PR, and will do better about reading project policies before contributing. I'll also keep my responses focused on the work, not the people,” wrote the thing called MJ Rathbun.

The Wall Street Journal covered this, but was not able to figure out who created Rathbun. So exactly what is going on remains a mystery. However, prior to the publication of the attack post against Shambaugh, a post was added to its blog with the title “Today's Topic.” It looks like a template for someone or something to follow for future blog posts with lots of bracketed text. “Today I learned about [topic] and how it applies to [context]. The key insight was that [main point],” reads one sentence. Another says “The most interesting part was discovering that [interesting finding]. This changes how I think about [related concept].”

It reads as if the agent was being instructed to blog as if writing bug fixes was constantly helping it unearth insights and interesting findings that change its thinking, and merit elaborate, first-person accounts, even if nothing remotely interesting actually happened to it that day.

Gizmodo is not a media criticism blog, but the Wall Street Journal's article headline about this, “When AI Bots Start Bullying Humans, Even Silicon Valley Gets Rattled” is a little on the apocalyptic side. To read the Journal's article, one could reasonably come away with the impression that the agent has cognition or even sentience, and a desire to hurt people. “The unexpected AI aggression is part of a rising wave of warnings that fast-accelerating AI capabilities can create real-world harms,” it says. About half the article is given over to Anthropic's work on AI safety.

Bear in mind that Anthropic surpassed OpenAI in total VC funding last week.

“In an earlier simulation, Anthropic showed that Claude and other AI models were at times willing to blackmail users—or even let an executive die in a hot server room—in order to avoid deactivation,” the Journal wrote. This scary imagery comes from Anthropic's own blockbuster blog posts about red-teaming exercises. They make for interesting reading, but they're also kinda like little sci-fi horror stories that function as commercials for the company. A version of Claude that commit these evil acts hasn't been released, so the message is, basically, Trust us. We're protecting you from the really bad stuff. You're welcome.

With a massive AI company like Anthropic out there benefiting from its image as humanity's protector from its own potentially dangerous product, it's probably a smart idea to assume, for the time being, that AI stories making any given AI sound sentient, malevolent, or uncannily autonomous, might just be exaggerations.

Yes, this blog post apparently by an AI agent reads like a feeble attempt at sliming a software engineer, which is bad, and certainly and reasonably irked Shambaugh a great deal. As Shambaugh rightly points out, “A human googling my name and seeing that post would probably be extremely confused about what was happening, but would (hopefully) ask me about it or click through to github and understand the situation.”

Still, the available evidence points not to an autonomous agent that woke up one day and decided to be the first digital cyberbully, but one directed to churn out hyperbolic blog posts under tight constraints, which, if true, would mean an individual careless person is responsible, not the incipient evil inside the machine.

If you ever need to destroy one of the best SSDs by drilling a hole in it, you need to make certain you hit the right spot. A recent viral Reddit story has reminded us that missing the target can have serious consequences. In this incident, an IT employee reportedly attempted to destroy a SATA SSD by drilling a hole through it before disposal, a common tactic for businesses to ensure their data is destroyed. However, the individual failed even to make contact with the SSD's PCB and left the drive intact, with the data still accessible, and the drive ended up on the market.

 






Logically, it's a huge security risk if the company's sensitive data falls into the wrong hands. Luckily, the Redditor who picked up the drive didn't have any evil intentions for it.

The story serves as a powerful lesson about the importance of proper data destruction procedures. Drilling a hole through a hard drive is as old-school as you can get. But SSDs are different, and some recent drives, like the one in the Reddit post, have shorter PCBs, so drilling a hole in the center may not reach the NAND chips. In this case, it didn't even touch the PCB. If you're going to drill the SSD, at least make multiple perforations or open the drive to ensure you hit the bullseye.

Manual destruction may be feasible for smaller companies, but it can be cumbersome for larger companies that manage many drives. In the latter case, it may justify engaging a hard drive or SSD destruction service, where you can pay a company to handle all the dirty work. For other cases, you can always invest in a storage medium destroyer.

For example, DiskMantler uses vibrations to destroy hard drives in 90 seconds. Then there is the less sophisticated approach, such as the Puncher P30, which drills four holes through your hard drive or SSD. Now, if you need rapid destruction, alternatives like the MediaGone 500 SSD & Flash Media Shredder can destroy hundreds of SSDs, USB flash drives, and smartphones in an hour, while the NVMe Destroyinator wipes data from up to 16 M.2 SSDs simultaneously at jaw-dropping speeds up to 64 GB/s.

If you insist on having personnel drill holes in your hard drives or SSDs, it would be wise to update the procedures manual to have them drill multiple holes at strategic locations, such as the NAND chips and controller, for maximum effectiveness. As a safety measure, you can add a clause requiring a thorough physical inspection of the drive after drilling.

Alternatively, a different tool could be a viable option. For example, a hammer can be surprisingly effective for destroying internal components and may be more satisfying than drilling. Ultimately, the goal is to leave no doubt that no data has been destroyed. A few extra steps can provide peace of mind for the employee and the organization.

The idiom ""getting more than you bargained for"" is usually applied in the context of unwanted, nasty consequences. Occasionally, it's used in the literal sense, like when AI engineer Aimilios Hatzistamou found his newly-bought sleep mask unwittingly granted him access to other users' EEG data and controls.

The story is fairly simple and serves as yet another illustration of why software is almost always an afterthought for many a product. Hatzistamou bought the sleep mask as a completed Kickstarter product from ""a small Chinese research company."" He refrained from naming the company, but our best guess is that it could be the SLEEPU DreamPilot.

Hatzistamou's mask had recalcitrant connection issues, so he did what engineers do: took matters into his own hands. With the help of Claude Opus 4.6, he took apart the mask's Bluetooth protocol, only to find that it didn't follow any standard convention. Undeterred, he turned his attention to the Android application, which he used Claude to decompile and analyze (transcript here).

Much to no software engineer's surprise, he found some hard-coded access credentials in the app binary, apparently shared across all copies of the app (doh!), as well as the expected API endpoints for sending/receiving data remotely. Eventually, he and Claude mapped out the mask's 15 commands and functions, and had the communication protocol reasonably reverse-engineered.

It was then time to make a small web app to control the mask. That worked fine, and Hatzistamou could get his mask's information and control its functions without using the buggy Android application. Alas, that was not the end of the story. During the reverse-engineering, he had Claude poke at the remote data endpoints. When connecting to the MQTT services with the aforementioned hardcoded credentials, he did indeed get his sensor readings... along with everyone else's.

 




Hatzistamou estimated that among the received data, about 25 masks were in use right there and then, and he even captured the real-time EEG readings from two hapless people somewhere on the planet. Since the mask has electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) and the access credentials are the same for every device, he could theoretically tell other masks to trigger electrical impulses.

The engineer sent his findings to the company, as he actually sounds happy with the product, data issues notwithstanding. As a developer myself, this situation doesn't appear to show any malicious intent from the makers and serves as yet another unsurprising illustration of how low the bar has become for software development in this day and age.

When something is truly meant for you, it will find its way to you regardless of the obstacles or the time it takes. The best SSDs are usually pricey these days, but not when you find them for the cost of a tank of gas. One Redditor took a gamble on a $50 damaged motherboard and walked away with over $1,500 worth of SSDs, or 12TB of cheap but fast storage, that the original owner left installed in the board.

 






The story may seem about fortune at first glance, but it's more about technical expertise, as the Redditor's sharp eye for detail and knowledge of PC hardware played a significant role. Nonetheless, we can't discount the role of luck in their stumbling upon the motherboard listing on eBay. The listing was for an MSI Pro Z690-A WiFi motherboard with a bent pin for an asking price of $50. What really caught the Redditor's attention was that all four M.2 slots still had their heatsinks installed. It was a very subtle hint that there may be SSDs under the hood.

Driven by rising SSD prices during the AI boom and a little hope, the Redditor made the half-hour drive to meet the seller and came home with four used M.2 SSDs that were operational. The haul was impressive: two WD Black SN850X 4TB, each retailing for $449.99; one Intel 670p 2TB, priced at $299.99; and a EOL Corsair Force MP600 2TB that sold for $374.99 at its peak. Overall, these high-performance SSDs returned $1,574.96 in value on a $50 investment.

Although launched four years ago, the WD Black SN850X, or should we say the Optimus GX Pro 850X, is still a very venerable SSD. There's a reason the drive remains our recommendation for the best M.2 SSD alternative. The Intel 670p and Corsair Force MP600 have long been retired, but they should suffice as secondary backup drives.

According to the author of the Reddit post, the eBay seller reportedly has limited knowledge of computer hardware and was selling the motherboard ""for lower than prices on eBay."" Some Redditors believe the motherboard was stolen, so the urgency to dispose of it as quickly as possible makes sense. Others think the seller may simply be unacquainted with computer hardware and its value, which could call into question the buyer's morality in the matter.

It's not uncommon to find very good deals on new and sometimes used computer hardware at unexpected places. People have bought the latest graphics cards at lower prices in Walmart's clearance aisles or spent $5 to $9 on older models at thrift stores. Marketplaces like eBay or Facebook could be the next destination for good deals, although sometimes you don't always know the provenance of what you're buying.

Valve has announced on the Steam Deck page that there is limited supply for the handheld console in some areas, with all three models on the site marked as “Out of stock”. The company said on the store page that the “Steam Deck OLED may be out-of-stock intermittently in some regions due to memory and storage shortages.” This is bad news for gamers, especially as the Steam Deck is one of the best handheld gaming PCs on the market.

 






The Steam Deck OLED is the latest victim of the AI boom, with data centers and AI hyperscalers using up the global supply of memory and storage chips. The Steam Deck LCD model was the first to go in Valve's handheld lineup, with the company discontinuing the most affordable model in late 2025. Although it did not give a reason for axing the $399 handheld, one of the plausible explanations for the move is that the 256GB is no longer profitable because of the skyrocketing prices of NAND chips.

RAM prices are expected to continue rising this year, meaning the situation will likely go from bad to worse. Valve isn't the only company to increase prices, cut production, or run out of stock — Apple admitted that it's chasing memory supply and that the shortage would have a greater impact on its Q2 earnings. Even the most expensive Mac Studio units with 512GB of Unified Memory are on backorder for up to 6 weeks because of demand from OpenClaw users.

 




This is also a bad sign for the Steam Machine, which was expected to arrive during the first quarter of 2026, but has since been delayed by the company. Valve also said that it will not subsidize the living room PC console and that it's expected to be priced competitively against entry-level gaming PCs. But with RAM, GPU, and SSD costs rising nearly every week, it seems that the console will break the $1,000 mark.

We first saw signs of the chip shortage affecting the Steam Deck last week, but this is the first time that Valve has acknowledged the lack of memory and storage chip supply. We hope that the company can find an alternative source for these chips so that it can resume orders and deliveries of its popular handheld. But if the shortage continues, gamers may have no choice but to go for the more expensive Asus ROG Xbox Ally X or Lenovo Legion Go 2 if they want a new gaming device right now.

About 1 in 3 older people in the UK uses herbal preparations or dietary supplements alongside prescription medicines, raising concerns about potentially dangerous interactions. 

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has warned about adverse effects and drug-herb interactions. Such reactions may go underreported because patients often do not disclose herbal use and clinicians do not routinely ask.

Under UK guidance on borderline products, items presented with medicinal claims may fall within medicines regulation rather than cosmetics or food supplements, placing them under MHRA oversight.

According to a 2018 review in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, concurrent use of herbal medicines and prescribed drugs is particularly common among patients with hypertension, diabetes, cancer, seizures, and depression.

Reported adverse effects from drug-herb interactions included elevated liver enzymes, gastrointestinal disturbances, disruption of international normalised ratio in patients taking warfarin, and kidney damage. Acute rejection episodes following heart, renal, or liver transplant were also reported in patients stabilised on immunosuppressants who were taking St John's wort.

Problems are especially prevalent among older patients, who are both more likely to use herbal remedies and less likely to report side-effects. They may also use multiple herbal products and are more subject to polypharmacy, increasing the risk of interactions. 

The MHRA regulates medicinal herbs as well as conventional medicines and warns that herbal products may interact with prescription and over-the-counter medicines.

Natasha Lloyd, president of the National Institute of Medical Herbalists, told Medscape News UK: “Herbs contain active phytochemicals with identifiable physiological effects.” Patients may self-prescribe or seek advice from their GP, she said, making clinical awareness of commonly used herbs important.

Herbal medicines are frequently used to modulate inflammation, digestion, nervous system activity, cardiovascular function, and metabolic balance. “When used appropriately and at therapeutic doses, they may help reduce symptom burden, improve tolerance to conventional medication, or support recovery,” Lloyd said. 

However, she added: “Safety depends on correct identification, quality, dosing and duration of use, and herbs should be considered with the same care as other therapeutics.” 

Lloyd said St John's wort is “vital” for clinicians to be aware of because it is a strong inducer of drug-metabolising cytochrome P450 enzymes. It can significantly reduce the effectiveness of various medications, including oral contraceptives, and interacts with multiple drugs. More than 600 known drug interactions have been reported, almost 300 of them major.

Other herbal products that clinicians should know about include:

The body may adapt to consistent use of a single herb, particularly those taken for nervous system support, potentially reducing effectiveness. Lloyd said practitioners may recommend “herbal cycling,” alternating agents or taking breaks to optimise efficacy and prevent tolerance.

GPs should also be aware of growing demand for plant-derived bioactive ingredients in so-called cosmeceuticals. These products are marketed for antioxidant, photoprotective, anti-ageing, antimicrobial, wound-healing, and anti-inflammatory properties.

However, some ingredients — including high ‑ strength retinoids, topical steroids, salicylic acid, oestrogen ‑ like compounds, and local anaesthetics — can be absorbed through the skin. This may add to the effects of oral drugs and increase toxicity risk. Patients may also be exposed to cumulative “cocktail” effects from multiple products.

Conversely, skin reactions such as redness, peeling, pigment changes, or acne‑like eruptions may be mistaken for adverse drug reactions.

Dr Bernard Ho, consultant dermatologist and spokesperson for the Skin Health Alliance, told Medscape News UK: “As clinicians, we're seeing more patients using cosmeceuticals to manage dermatological conditions traditionally treated with prescription medicines.”

Ho said the trend reflects patients' interest in self-directed skincare solutions.

“For clinicians, this trend underscores the need to engage openly with patients about what they're using and why, particularly where ingredients overlap with pharmacologically active substances,” he said.

Ho said products making therapeutic claims while labelled as cosmetics should be evaluated to ensure formulations are safe and supported by credible evidence, citing what he described as a “regulatory gap.” Transparent evidence standards are “key to maintaining trust among clinicians and patients alike,” he added.

Escalation of treatment through systemic therapy intensification, targeted agents, or combination regimens might improve cure rates in biologically aggressive early breast cancer. Conversely, de-escalation strategies are being studied to minimize toxicity, overtreatment, and long-term side effects in patients with lower-risk or highly responsive tumors in patients with early-stage disease. 

In early-stage, HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, genomic profiling tools can determine whether chemotherapy or extended endocrine therapy adds meaningful benefit. Patients with low recurrence scores tend to have a low risk for distant relapse and excellent outcomes; therapy can often be de-escalated to endocrine therapy alone. In low-risk HR-positive, HER2-negative disease with a low genomic score, adjuvant chemotherapy typically adds limited benefit while increasing toxicity. Further, CDK 4/6 inhibitors are typically not indicated in this low-risk setting.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is generally reserved for locally advanced disease, node-positive or inoperable disease, or when downstaging is needed.

Platinum-based regimens are generally not standard for the routine treatment of stage IA HR-positive, HER2-negative disease.

Learn more about endocrine therapy for breast cancer.

In TNBC, achieving pCR after neoadjuvant therapy is strongly associated with favorable overall survival and event-free survival. Contemporary response-adapted strategies tend to focus escalation on patients with residual disease while exploring de-escalation for complete responders. Given these results, experts suggest that treatment de-escalation can be considered for patients with TNBC who achieved complete pCR. However, this is based on individual patients; if certain treatment regimens are planned, it is advised to proceed accordingly. Further, duration-shortening or omission strategies are still under investigation.

ctDNA in early breast cancer is promising but still in the analytical and clinical validation stage, with clinical decision-making applications generally trial-based rather than standard.

Learn more about neoadjuvant therapies for breast cancer.

In low-risk, node-negative, HER2-positive disease, an approach using a limited duration of taxane-based chemotherapy paired with single-agent anti-HER2 therapy (followed by completion of anti‑HER2 therapy) has demonstrated excellent long-term disease control in prospective studies. This strategy intentionally avoids anthracyclines and other intensive multi-agent regimens to reduce treatment burden without compromising patient outcomes in appropriately selected patients.

Anthracycline-containing, dual anti-HER2 regimens are typically reserved for higher-risk disease.

More intensive multi-agent chemotherapy with dual anti-HER2 blockade is generally used for higher-risk presentations and represents escalation rather than de-escalation for this group.

Anti-HER2 therapy alone is generally not considered an adequately validated approach for most patients in this risk category outside of specific circumstances (eg, comorbidity or chemotherapy contraindication) or clinical trials.

Learn more about chemotherapy for breast cancer.

Patients with high recurrence scores or multiple involved nodes remain at substantial risk of recurrence despite endocrine therapy. For these patients, escalation is an evidence-based option. These approaches target micrometastatic residual disease, improving disease-free survival in higher-risk subgroups identified by biology and stage rather than demographics alone.

Menopausal status can influence the type of endocrine therapy, but it alone is not a reliable driver of escalation beyond endocrine therapy. Age by itself is not a primary escalation trigger as well.

Family history affects genetics or risk of developing cancer and might prompt genetic testing, enhanced screening, and consideration of risk-reducing surgery, but it does not directly escalate systemic therapy for an already-diagnosed early HR-positive tumor in the way nodal burden does.

Learn more about breast cancer.

For patients with early-stage breast cancer, partial-breast irradiation is a recommended de-escalation option following lumpectomy. This method has proven equivalent to whole-breast radiation in preventing local recurrence, with reduced treatment time and toxicity. Data have shown that individualized radiotherapy de-escalation (whether by limiting volume, dose, or duration) can preserve excellent local control.

Radiotherapy omission is only considered in narrowly defined populations, often older patients with very favorable tumor biology.

Bilateral mastectomy is generally not a de-escalation strategy for locoregional management of a low-risk, unilateral cancer.

Maternal thyroid function or the status of common thyroid autoantibodies during early pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk for birth defects in children; however, positivity for thyroid-stimulating autoantibodies was associated with a higher risk.

""The findings inform clinical practice regarding risks and recommendations for treatment of the hyperthyroidism of GD [Graves disease] in pregnant women,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Stine Linding Andersen, MD, PhD, DMSc, Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark. It was published online on February 04, 2026, in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.

TSH levels were measured only once during early pregnancy, which may not have reflected consistent thyroid function abnormalities and actual thyroid disease. The study primarily included pregnant women with normal thyroid function, and a significant number of women with TSH levels below the lower reference interval likely had gestational transient thyrotoxicosis rather than hyperthyroidism due to Graves disease.

The research was conducted using the Danish National Biobank resource and was financially supported by the Novo Nordisk Foundation. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Oligometastatic cancer is regarded as an ""intermediate state"" between localized disease and widely diffused metastasis. It is also a significant area of current research in breast cancer.

The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), and European Society for Radiotherapy define oligometastatic breast cancer as a disease with up to five metastatic lesions. Additionally, each of these lesions must be ""amenable to local therapy aimed at achieving a [no evidence of disease] status."" This definition is utilized in current literature. Although rates of oligometastatic disease are not routinely tracked due to its emerging status, a review published in ASCO's journal estimates the figure at 15%-40% of newly diagnosed metastatic breast cancer cases. This is similar to European studies, reporting that approximately 20% of patients with metastatic breast cancer have oligometastatic disease.

According to the proposed comprehensive classification system for oligometastatic disease, genuine oligometastatic disease refers to the standard classification of limited metastatic spread without polymetastatic disease; patients with a previous history of polymetastatic disease are classified as having induced oligometastatic disease.

De novo and repeat oligometastatic diseases are subclasses of genuine oligometastatic disease. De novo refers to those who are diagnosed with oligometastatic disease for the first time, whereas repeat oligometastatic disease applies to those with a previous history of oligometastatic disease.

Learn more about breast cancer workup.

A recent review reported that patients with de novo oligometastatic breast cancer tend to have longer overall survival. This might be due to slower growth rates and lower metastatic potential, lead time bias, and/or more aggressive treatment approaches. The same review also noted that removing only the primary tumor alone, without ablating metastatic lesions, did not benefit this population. Additionally, management of oligometastatic breast cancer is variable; treatments for this setting include stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), proton beam therapy, local ablative therapy, and systemic therapies.

According to current research, CT ""best detects lung metastasis."" MRI is preferred for examining local tumor extent, nearby organ invasion, and regional lymph nodes. Compared with both modalities, 18F-FDG PET/CT has higher specificity and sensitivity when locating distant metastasis and affected lymph nodes. Staging of oligometastatic breast cancer usually relies on imaging modalities, rather than biomarkers, and imaging choices can depend on metastasis site, though some guidelines have general preferences. For example, ESMO guidelines recommend that patients who are suspected of having oligometastatic breast cancer should undergo biopsy for confirmation and systemic imaging for staging, preferably with PET. Following diagnosis, therapy decisions should consider the sites of metastasis as well as management of the primary tumor.

SBRT is used to treat oligometastatic disease in patients with breast cancer. Recent data indicate that patients with bone-only metastases typically have a favorable response to SBRT. Response is comparatively less favorable for patients with visceral metastasis, such as liver, lung, and brain, though SBRT is still recommended for these patients. This is consistent with previously published data, which state that those with bone-only oligometastatic breast cancer have better prognosis than those with lung, liver, or brain metastases.

Reciprocal in vitro fertilization (IVF), where one partner donates oocytes while the other carries the pregnancy, demonstrates clinical pregnancy rates (64% vs 57%) and live birth rates (52% vs 48%) comparable to that with autologous IVF in same-sex female couples.

“Reciprocal IVF has gained clinical and social relevance with the growing accessibility of IVF and evolving acceptance in the queer community,” the authors of the study wrote. “Reciprocal IVF is an effective option for same-sex female couples, with outcomes comparable with traditional autologous IVF,” they added.

The study was led by Daniela Diego, MD, Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Emory University in Atlanta. It was published online on February 12 in JAMA.

According to the authors, a key limitation was that the relatively recent inclusion of partner sex in the Society of Assisted Reproduction and Technology database may have resulted in some cycles not being captured in this analysis.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a heterogeneous inflammatory arthritis that can mimic rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA), crystal disease, and other causes of joint pain. Recognizing hallmark clinical patterns can reduce diagnostic delay and support earlier intervention to help prevent irreversible joint damage and long-term disability.

Current or prior dactylitis is explicitly included in the CASPAR classification criteria for PsA and supports PsA classification when evaluating inflammatory arthritis. Skin and nail lesions, psoriasis, negative rheumatoid factor, juxtaarticular bone formation (ie, “distinct from osteophytes”) are also part of this criteria.

Symmetric MCP synovitis, positive rheumatoid factor, and marginal erosions without new bone formation are more often seen in RA.

Learn more about the diagnosis of PsA.

Enthesitis is a musculoskeletal feature of PsA that can occur before the development of arthritis, including as the sole early manifestation. Common sites include the plantar fascia, Achilles tendon, lateral epicondyle of the elbow, and ligament attachments around the knee. In addition to a suggestive physical exam at these locations in patients with PsA, musculoskeletal ultrasound often shows a positive power doppler, suggesting active inflammation.

Subcutaneous nodules, fixed deformities without active inflammation, and atlantoaxial cervical spine instability are more often seen in later stages of PsA and do not as frequently precede arthritis.

Learn more about the presentation of PsA.

Peritendinitis of the finger extensor has been described on musculoskeletal ultrasound as a form of extrasynovial inflammation in PsA and might be a helpful imaging feature when differentiating PsA from RA. This pattern often reflects functional mini-entheseal involvement at the MCP joint level and might contribute to hand swelling even in the absence of prominent intraarticular synovitis, consistent with the predominance of extrasynovial inflammatory mechanisms described in PsA.

Wrist (radiocarpal) erosions and extensor carpi ulnaris tenosynovitis are more often seen in RA; they typically do not distinguish PsA from other inflammatory arthritides.

Isolated intraarticular synovitis with Doppler signal is a nonspecific ultrasonographic finding and usually does not distinguish PsA from other inflammatory arthritides.

Learn more about imaging findings in PsA.

Nail pitting is a characteristic manifestation of psoriatic nail disease and is closely associated with PsA.

Beau lines are transverse depressions in the nail plate reflecting temporary interruption of nail matrix growth due to systemic illness, medications, or other stressors rather than inflammatory arthropathy.

Though onychomycosis (a chronic fungal infection of the nail unit characterized by nail discoloration, thickening, subungual hyperkeratosis, and onycholysis) can has overlap with PsA, paronychia (another form of infection) is not as commonly seen.

Learn more about nail involvement in PsA.

Distal interphalangeal joint involvement commonly supports a diagnosis of PsA. PsA can involve the distal interphalangeal joints as part of a peripheral inflammatory arthritis pattern, whereas OA is primarily mechanical and more strongly associated with activity-related pain and brief (< 30 minute) stiffness.

Further, bony enlargement with Heberden nodes, and radiographic osteophytes and subchondral sclerosis more often reflect OA. Acute episodic distal joint pain with chondrocalcinosis is characteristic of crystal arthropathy.

Global health has undergone historic transformation. The burden of infectious diseases has steadily declined, whereas noncommunicable diseases have become increasingly significant, even in socioeconomically weak countries. However, the impact of COVID, however, highlights how new pathogens can rapidly undo decades of progress. These global gains depend on international collaboration and public spending, both of which are increasingly at risk in the current geopolitical climate, including in Italy.

New data from the Global Burden of Disease study, published in The Lancet at the end of 2025, will provide the most comprehensive quantitative assessment of global health trends through 2023. Led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, Seattle, the collaboration now includes 19,000 researchers across 204 countries and evaluates 375 diseases and injuries and 88 modifiable risk factors.

These findings confirm a historic epidemiologic transition with significant implications for preparedness and equity.

The global age-standardized mortality rate declined from 1009 per 100,000 in 2000 to 701.5 per 100,000 in 2023, a reduction of 30.5%. The global life expectancy has increased to 76.3 years for women and 71.5 years for men.

Ischemic cardiovascular disease and stroke remain the leading causes of death worldwide, consistent with trends since 1990, except in 2021, when COVID ranked first. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ranks third, followed by lower respiratory infections, neonatal disorders, Alzheimer's disease, lung cancer, and diabetes.

Mortality rates for most major causes have declined since 1990. Stroke mortality fell from 161.4 to 99.8 deaths per 100,000 individuals. However, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, and HIV/AIDS showed increased mortality over the same period. Between 2013 and 2023, deaths related to heat and cold exposure increased by 6% annually, drug use disorders by 5%, diabetes by 3%, and conflict and terrorism by 1%.

Infectious disease mortality has steadily declined over the past few decades. In 2023, lower respiratory infections were the only infectious condition among the top 10 causes of death, with a mortality rate of 50% since 1990. Diarrhea and tuberculosis fell from third and seventh places in 1990 to 13th and 15th places, respectively.

Vaccine-preventable diseases showed a 66.5% reduction in the number of lives lost.

From 2019 through 2023, COVID caused an estimated 18 million deaths worldwide, with mortality peaking in 2021 at 9.42 million deaths. The number of deaths then declined to 2.36 million in 2022 and 797,000 in 2023. The situation has since started to normalize. In 2023, COVID ranked as the 20th leading cause of death globally, and 194 of 204 countries (95.1%) experienced at least a partial recovery in mortality rates. Among these, approximately two thirds (125 countries) returned to their pre-pandemic levels.

In sub-Saharan Africa, deaths from infectious diseases have decreased from 73.4% to 51.4% of total deaths between 1990 and 2023. Life expectancy ranges from approximately 83 years of age in high-income regions to 62-66 years of age in sub-Saharan Africa. Mortality was closely correlated with the sociodemographic index (SDI).

Regions with lower SDIs are beginning to experience significant impacts from noncommunicable disease mortality superimposed on incomplete infectious disease control, for which the health systems in these regions are often unprepared. Age-standardized and cardiovascular mortality rates remain higher in these regions and have not declined at the pace observed in countries with high SDI.

In high-income North America, mortality among individuals aged 30-39 years has increased by 50% since 2011. Researchers attribute much of this increase to deaths from despair, including suicide, substance use, and alcohol-related causes, which disproportionately affect rural, minority, and lower-income populations.

Globally, premature mortality under the age of 70 years has declined between 2000 and 2023, but progress has varied widely. Reductions reached 43.8% for men in East Asia but only 9.6% in high-income North America. The decline in mortality varied according to sex and region. Among men, mortality fell by 43.8% in East Asia but by only 9.6% in high-income North America. Among women, mortality declined by 58.2% in East Asia compared with 2.6% in Oceania.

In contrast, 10 countries recorded sharp increases in mortality among individuals aged < 70 years between 2000 and 2023. The largest increase occurred in Palestine at 33.1%, more than double the increase observed in Lebanon, the second-ranked country, at 15.3%. Researchers have attributed this increase primarily to armed conflicts.

In 2023, Palestine recorded the highest death rate worldwide from conflict and terrorism, at 385.8 deaths per 100,000 population, more than five times higher than the second-highest rate reported in Ukraine at 70.1 per 100,000. Sudan ranked third, followed by Russia and Burkina Faso in the fourth and fifth places, respectively.

Injuries to the lower extremities are among the greatest health risks in elite alpine and Nordic winter sports. A retrospective analysis of the medical records of 99 athletes from Turkey's national teams across five winter sports shows how significantly the sheer frequency of individual diagnoses differs from their actual impact.

The analysis makes it clear that the most common injury is not necessarily the most serious, especially when the duration of training and competition absences is considered. The study was published in the Journal of Clinical Medicine.

The cohort included 34 women and 65 men. The athletes averaged 18 years of age, had logged about 3700 hours of training and competition over their careers, and sustained their first injury at a mean age of 15.5 years.

In their analysis, the researchers distinguished between incidence — injuries per 10,000 hours of sport — and the so‑called injury burden. Injury burden denotes weeks of absence per 10,000 hours of sport and therefore allows a more realistic assessment of the consequences of accidents.

Across all disciplines, ankle sprains were the most frequent diagnosis. The overall incidence was 1.7 injuries per 10,000 hours, with snowboarders particularly affected 3.2 and alpine skiers at 2.8 injuries per 10,000 hours.

Despite these comparatively high figures, the consequences remained manageable: Ankle injuries averaged 4.4 weeks of absence per 10,000 hours. While certainly relevant from a sports medicine perspective, they are not the most consequential injury for athletes.

The picture was markedly worse for medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS). Although it occurred less often than ankle sprains — 0.9 injuries per 10,000 hours — the burden was substantially higher: 9.5 weeks of absence per 10,000 hours, the highest value in the cohort.

This pattern was especially pronounced in cross‑country skiing. There, MTSS reached an incidence of 1.6 and caused 13.4 weeks of absence per 10,000 hours. The data illustrate how overuse injuries can severely impair performance. Insidious complaints do not immediately end training but can accumulate over weeks and months into significant performance losses.

Differences between female and male athletes were most notable for cruciate ligament injuries. For women, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture was the most burdensome injury: incidence was 0.4 per 10,000 hours, and the burden was 16.2 weeks of absence per 10,000 hours. For men, MTSS — at 9.7 weeks of absence per 10,000 hours — produced the greatest sporting consequences.

These figures argue clearly for sex‑specific prevention strategies, particularly intensified neuromuscular training to reduce the risk for ACL injuries in female athletes.

Clear differences also emerged between disciplines. In alpine skiing, ACL rupture was the most consequential injury, with 34.3 weeks of absence per 10,000 hours. Among snowboarders, injuries to the knee collateral ligaments caused the highest burden, at 27.8 weeks of absence per 10,000 hours.

These patterns reflect the specific biomechanical demands of each discipline — from repetitive loading in cross‑country skiing to abrupt rotational and valgus‑stress situations in alpine racing.

Another finding of the analysis was that most injuries occurred in training rather than competition. The longer cumulative training hours are likely the main reason.

The authors therefore recommend prioritizing prevention measures in training, eg, through systematic load management, technique optimization and recovery strategies.

The data make clear that incidence alone does not determine the relevance of an injury in winter sports. Although ankle sprains dominate numerically, MTSS and ACL ruptures have far more serious consequences for athletes' subsequent careers.

The authors wrote that prevention in winter sports must therefore pursue two strategies: reduce the risk for acute trauma and effectively prevent overuse injuries. They also called for sex‑ and discipline‑specific concepts to help safeguard athletes' careers over the long term.

Among pregnant women diagnosed with depression, the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was associated with higher odds of gestational diabetes and neonatal adaptation problems and lower odds of preterm birth after accounting for the severity of maternal depression.

""[The study] results provide reassurance that SSRI use during pregnancy does not increase the risk of preterm birth and may even be associated with a reduced risk of preterm birth when treating maternal depression. Given the increased risk of problems related to neonatal adaptation, neonatal monitoring remains important,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Heli Malm, MD, PhD, Research Centre for Child Psychiatry, University of Turku, Turku, Finland. It was published online on February 04, 2026, in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM.

As depression symptoms were not measured directly, the severity of depression could not be assessed from registry data. The observational nature of the study limited causal interference.

Adults with higher relative fat mass had an increased likelihood of having chronic diarrhea. However, this measure alone had only a modest ability to discriminate individuals with the condition.

“By focusing on visceral adiposity rather than generalized obesity, this study provides new insights into the heterogeneity of obesity-related gastrointestinal dysfunction,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was jointly led by Kunlong Yang, Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, and Qiao Chen, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Guangxi, China. It was published online in Digestive Diseases and Sciences.

The study was cross-sectional, so it could not establish that high relative fat mass caused chronic diarrhea. Unmeasured factors may have affected the results, and survey data may not reflect all populations. Relative fat mass also had only modest predictive value and could not be used alone to diagnose risk.

The study received financial support from one of the authors. The authors declared having no competing interests.

A Virtual Physiotherapy Group Intervention for Chronic Cough (ViP-Cough) achieved 80% uptake, with patients who received this intervention showing significant reductions in cough severity, cough frequency, and impact of cough on daily life.

“Our findings emphasize the importance of patient choice in how individuals engage with and receive healthcare. For some, group therapy and virtual treatment options may not be appropriate or preferential. This insight is crucial for clinical service planning, as it underlines the need to ensure that clinical service capacity can meet the demand for varying models of care delivery such as group therapy, one-to-one virtual appointments, and one-to-one face-to-face consultations,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Charles C. Reilly, PhD, King's College Hospital National Health Service Foundation Trust, London, England. It was published online on January 22, 2026, in ERJ Open Research.

The retrospective and uncontrolled design limited the ability to establish causal inferences, and the reliance on pragmatic patient‑reported numerical rating scales instead of validated or objective measures weakened the robustness of the outcomes. In most cases, the same clinician assessed, delivered the intervention, and completed follow-up, which may have introduced bias.

No specific funding was reported for this study. Two authors reported receiving investigator-initiated research grants and consultancy fees from various pharmaceutical companies.

Management of gestational diabetes can be more efficient with the use continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), according to new research presented at the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) 2026 Annual Pregnancy Meeting.

CGM has improved care for type 1 diabetes, but its ability to predict outcomes in gestational diabetes has not been well studied, said Amy Valent, DO, MCR, associate professor in the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, Oregon, and lead author of the study.

Gestational diabetes affects 10%-14% of all pregnancies, and data suggest that rates are rising, said Emily Fay, MD, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Washington, Seattle, who also helped author the research.

Fay said the study did not definitively answer whether CGMs should always be used for the condition's management, but they can “give us more blood sugar information, such as time in range and nocturnal hyperglycemia, that is not able to be obtained through self-monitoring of blood glucose through finger sticks,” she said.

Fay and Valent analyzed data from 205 individuals with gestational diabetes across three randomized, controlled trials involving two devices (Dexcom G6 or G6 Pro) to examine the relationship between time spent within the target range for pregnancy (63-140 mg/dL) and composite neonatal outcomes. These included admission to the NICU, transient abnormal rapid breathing, respiratory distress syndrome, birth injury, or hyperbilirubinemia that required phototherapy.

Thirty-two individuals (16%) had newborns who experienced one of the adverse outcomes. Those who spent more time with the healthy range had lower rates of infants with composite outcomes, particularly those who came in under 120 mg/dL.

Each one-category difference in time in target range was associated with an 18% risk reduction of neonatal adverse outcomes (risk ratio [RR], 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69-0.98), with a 21% risk reduction if within the lower range of 63-120 mg/dL (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-0.97).

The risk for adverse outcomes was lowest among individuals with a 24-hour mean glucose less than 94 mg/dL.

Risks for adverse outcomes generally increase with increasing blood sugar values, as has been demonstrated by other research, Fay noted. Prospective studies with larger sample sizes are needed to better characterize the relationship between time in range and the outcomes, she said.

CGM and artificial intelligence are more widely used in medicine recently and more patients are asking about their use, said Thinh Nguyen, MD, division chief of perinatal care at Nemours Children's Health in Orlando, Florida, who was not involved with the study.

“It is important for the medical community to make sure we understand how to best apply and direct care for patients who use CGMs,” Nguyen said.

The study results confirmed prior data and assumptions that good glycemic control reduced the risk for neonatal complications associated with gestational diabetes, Nguyen said.

Many patients find CGM monitoring easier than traditional fingerstick method, which may improve compliance, Nguyen said. In addition, many CGM's have phone-based apps that allow for automatic data submission to clinicians, which improves communication and enables faster data analysis and timely treatment, he said. In clinical practice, the two most significant barriers to the use of CGM remain cost and insurance coverage, he noted.

The study received no outside funding. The researchers disclosed having no financial conflicts of interest.

Martine  Perez

PARIS — Women experience hormonal fluctuations throughout life that affect mood and may help explain their higher rates of depressive disorders. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and its severe form, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), affect more than half of women. At the Brain Congress 2026 held in Paris from January 21 to 23, 2026, a session was entirely devoted to answering this question, “Do hormones make people irritable?”

In that context, the pathophysiology of PMS and PMDD and potential therapeutic approaches were analyzed at length byAnne-Laure Sutter‑Dallay, MD, PhD, perinatal psychiatrist at Charles Perrens University Hospital in Bordeaux, France.

Premenstrual syndrome was mentioned long ago by Hippocrates, albeit with some rather fanciful hypotheses. In 1953, Greene and Dalton formalized the concept by describing periodic physical and psychological symptoms in women of reproductive age. Later, PMDD was conceptualized to define severe presentations with primarily psychological manifestations, and it is now classified as a depressive disorder in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5).

PMS and PMDD are characterized by symptoms that appear in the luteal phase after ovulation, improve in the days following the onset of menstruation, and disappear in the follicular phase. PMDD goes undiagnosed in more than half of cases, despite the loss of quality of life it causes, Sutter‑Dallay said.

PMS presents with predominantly physical symptoms such as breast swelling and weight gain, accompanied by mild psychological symptoms like irritability and labile mood. Between 75%-85% of women experience at least one of these symptoms. Moderate-to-severe forms of PMS affect 25%-30% of women, and PMDD affects 2%-9%, with severe manifestations that are primarily psychological. PMDD is defined by the presence of at least five symptoms over two consecutive cycles, including at least one affective symptom and one cognitive, behavioral, or physical symptom such as emotional lability, irritability, depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness or self-deprecation, anxiety, tension, reduced interest in usual activities, subjective difficulty concentrating, lethargy, excessive fatigability, changes in appetite, overeating, strong cravings for certain foods, hypersomnia or insomnia, feeling overwhelmed or out of control, breast tenderness, edema, joint pain, muscle pain, and weight gain.

Women suffering from PMDD more often have psychiatric comorbidities than others, including bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, and depressive disorders.

Studies have also shown that PMDD is associated with an increased risk for postpartum depression, a fourfold higher risk for suicidal thoughts, and a sevenfold higher risk for suicide attempts. These women also have higher rates of past trauma, smoking, obesity, and are more likely to come from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds.

How can PMS, in all its forms including the most severe, be explained? These disorders appear after ovulation, when progesterone rises.Women with PMDD may also have lower luteal phase estradiol levels or an abnormal response to hormonal fluctuations.

These syndromes may result from interactions between cyclical variations in ovarian hormones and central neurotransmitters via GABAergic, serotonergic, and opioid pathways. A metabolite of progesterone, allopregnanolone — which normally has sedative and anxiolytic properties — may be involved in PMDD pathophysiology. Women with PMDD may have lower luteal‑phase allopregnanolone levels or an abnormal response to its cycle‑related variations, Sutter‑Dallay said. There also appears to be an increase in proinflammatory markers during the luteal phase, which is more pronounced in PMDD. Finally, genetic heritability of PMDD is estimated at about 20%-40% in studies comparing monozygotic and dizygotic twins.

What are the treatment options? Because the pathophysiology is not fully elucidated, several therapies have been proposed. In women with severe symptoms, trials have tested antidepressants such as sertraline, fluoxetine, and paroxetine, given either continuously or intermittently during the luteal phase. Results show a reduction in dysphoric symptoms of approximately 40%-60% compared with 20%-30% with placebo.

This effectiveness suggests serotonin may be involved in PMDD pathophysiology, perhaps because selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors increase allopregnanolone levels. Low‑dose combined oral contraceptives containing drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol may be offered, observing their contraindications like overweight and cigarette smoking, although efficacy still needs confirmation, Sutter‑Dallay said. More radical strategies — such as ovulation suppression with gonadotropin‑releasing hormone agonists, danazol, or, more definitively, ovariectomy — eliminate symptom cyclicity but are associated with severe side effects and are not standard treatments. A new therapeutic avenue is the use of allopregnanolone antagonists, such as sepranolone (UC1010).

Finally, lifestyle changes may affect mood in marked PMS or PMDD: dietary changes with reduced caffeine and simple sugars, as well as physical exercise. Psychotherapy, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy, can also help women cope with symptoms.

PMDD therefore remains underrecognized and underdiagnosed, and progress is still needed in management, notably with the development of specific treatments.

Hospitalization for a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection was associated with an increased risk for myocardial infarction, stroke, exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), exacerbations of congestive heart failure (CHF), and arrhythmias. The risk was highest in the first 2 weeks after hospitalization and persisted for up to 42 days for most conditions.

“Results of our study support a potential role of RSV infection in triggering cardiorespiratory complications in adults, especially older adults, and present a clinical and economic burden beyond the acute phase of the illness,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by Caihua Liang, MD, PhD, Vaccines Real-World Evidence Epidemiology, Pfizer, Inc., New York City. It was published online on February 3, 2026, in JAMA Network Open.

The findings might not have been generalizable to people outside the US, uninsured individuals, or members of plans not represented in the dataset. The sensitivity of RSV coding in older adults was low because testing was limited, which may have led to missed cases and reduced statistical power. Unmeasured factors that changed over time could have influenced the findings. 

The study was sponsored by Pfizer, Inc. Seven authors reported being employees of Pfizer, and six reported owning stocks with Pfizer. One author reported receiving nonfinancial support from Genesis Research (funded by Pfizer), and another reported receiving personal fees from Genesis Research.

In patients with suspected autoinflammation, whole exome sequencing (WES) achieved a 19.5% diagnostic yield, compared with 14.9% with targeted gene panel testing for autoinflammatory disease testing, and WES also enabled the identification of incidental findings.

“WES undoubtedly leads to increased diagnostic yield for multiple reasons, including increased numbers of genes compared to TGPs [targeted gene panels] and more sophisticated analytical approaches,” the authors wrote. “We recognize that WES is not available widely in routine clinical care, despite a narrowing of the gap in cost between TGP and WES. Therefore, we advocate for WES/[whole-genome sequencing] to be increasingly used in the future because the clinical impact may be significant,” they added.

The study was led by Fiona Price-Kuehne, MBBS, and Alice Burleigh, PhD, University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London. Burleigh is now a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Edinburgh in Edinburgh, Scotland. It was published online on January 29, 2026, in Rheumatology.

The findings may be affected by referral bias due to the focus on a specialized service in a UK-based cohort. WES incorporated copy number variant analysis but lacked sensitivity for detecting large chromosomal abnormalities and smaller copy number changes. The lower depth of coverage in WES compared with targeted gene panels could hinder the detection of low-level somatic mutations.

The study received funding from Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity, Rosetrees Trust, the National Institute of Health and Care Research Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, and Versus Arthritis. Two authors disclosed receiving institutional grants, and one of them declared receiving consultancy and speaker fees from various sources including Novartis, SOBI, and Roche.

Dr Álvaro  de la Serna

Prebiotics and probiotics have been incorporated into clinical practice with a degree of ease that contrasts with the complexity of the evidence supporting their use. Part of this acceptance may be explained by their perception as “natural” and, therefore, harmless interventions.

However, one of the most common errors is treating probiotics as a therapeutic category. The available evidence requires a far more precise approach, moving away from generic and abstract concepts toward the clinical use of specific strains and defined doses for clearly established indications.

Probiotics are live microorganisms that confer health benefits to the host when administered in adequate amounts.

The strongest evidence supports their use in antibiotic-associated diarrhea and, to a lesser extent, in acute infectious diarrhea. Multiple systematic reviews and clinical guidelines have concluded that certain strains reduce symptom duration and the risk for diarrhea, although effect sizes are modest and vary by product. Efficacy cannot be extrapolated across commercial formulations, even when they share the same bacterial genus.

Some guidelines suggest probiotics in carefully selected individuals for the prevention of Clostridioides difficile infection. Recommendations remain weak and emphasize the need to assess individual risk profiles. A similar scenario applies to pouchitis, defined as inflammation of the ileoanal pouch in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease who have undergone total colectomy. In this setting, specific multistrain combinations provide compelling evidence. These findings should not be generalized to other manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease.

In highly prevalent outpatient conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, the evidence is heterogeneous. Some studies have reported modest benefits for symptoms such as abdominal bloating, but the results are inconsistent and depend on both the strain used and patient subgroups. Probiotics may benefit certain individuals; however, they do not represent a universally applicable recommendation with predictable outcomes.

Prebiotics, which are nondigestible substances that selectively stimulate the growth or activity of potentially beneficial bacteria, can modulate the gut microbial ecosystem and improve functional symptoms. Their effects are frequently dose-dependent. Higher doses may exacerbate gastrointestinal symptoms, limiting their clinical applicability.

In the general population, probiotics and prebiotics are usually associated with mild, transient gastrointestinal adverse effects. However, this safety profile should not be assumed to be universally applicable.

In immunocompromised or critically ill individuals, in those with severe disruption of the intestinal barrier, and in those with central venous catheters, cases of bacteremia and fungemia attributed to probiotic microorganisms have been reported. Although rare, this complication is clinically significant. In such contexts, caution should take precedence over potential benefits, given the limited evidence supporting its use.

Concerns have also been raised regarding the potential transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes from probiotic strains to the intestinal microbiota. This possibility underscores the need for well-characterized products that undergo rigorous safety evaluations.

Clinicians should select specific microorganisms for defined indications when recommending probiotics. Strains such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Saccharomyces boulardii have been evaluated in antibiotic-associated diarrhea, whereas Bifidobacterium longum BB536 has some evidence in chronic constipation.

Even in these scenarios, clinicians should clearly communicate the expected benefits and limitations, particularly because the formulations are not always commercially available.

Available evidence indicates that prebiotics and probiotics may be beneficial for specific clinical indications. However, they are not broadly generalizable interventions and do not consistently produce clinically meaningful effect sizes. Although it can be difficult to look at past commercial messaging and social trends, clinicians have a responsibility to critically evaluate the available data, including its nuances and limitations, and translate them into individualized clinical decisions.

Further research focused on specific strains, their risk for adverse effects, and outcomes with clear clinical relevance is essential to clarify a field in which uncertainty outweighs established evidence.

New neuroimaging research shows that when sleep-deprived people lose focus, the brain briefly shifts toward sleep-like physiology, offering fresh insight into why cognitive performance declines without adequate rest.



Study: Attentional failures after sleep deprivation are locked to joint neurovascular, pupil and cerebrospinal fluid flow dynamics. Image Credit: New Africa / Shuttertock

In a recent study published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, researchers investigated the precise physiological dynamics associated with transient attentional lapses during acute sleep deprivation rather than a broader clinical ""brain fog"" syndrome often observed during sleep deprivation. The multimodal study leveraged data from 26 healthy adults and found that when sleep-deprived individuals experience lapses in attention, their brains undergo a coordinated shift in physiology involving neural activity, blood flow, and pupil diameter.

Most notably, the study found that these lapses are synchronized with sleep-like large-amplitude low-frequency oscillatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) waves typically seen predominantly during sleep. The study therefore concludes that attention failures are not random errors or neural deficits but reflect coordinated brain–body state changes whose functional role remains uncertain, rather than a demonstrated attempt to activate metabolic waste-clearance systems.

Sleep deprivation, defined as poor-quality or insufficient sleep (7-9 hours for adults), is a pervasive issue in modern society, with clinically documented consequences ranging from reduced cognitive performance to increased risk of accidents.

While decades of research have established a causal relationship between insufficient sleep and ""attention failures,"" defined as moments when an individual fails to respond to an obvious stimulus, the specific neural and physiological mechanisms driving these lapses remain debated.

Recent research has shown that during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, the brain exhibits large, rhythmic waves of CSF flow. Termed colloquially ""brain washing,"" although these oscillations are bidirectional and not established as net waste-clearance flow, these processes are thought to help clear metabolic waste products and have previously been considered incompatible with wakefulness; however, this belief remains scientifically unverified.

The present study hypothesizes that the boundaries between sleep and wakefulness may blur in sleep-deprived subjects, allowing CSF dynamics to disrupt cognition even during apparent wakefulness. It tests this hypothesis through a multimodal study involving 26 healthy adults, with a mean age of 25.6 years.

The study employed a within-subjects design in which each participant was tested twice: once after a full night of rest and once after a night of total sleep deprivation monitored in a laboratory, thereby controlling for inter-participant variation.

Participants were required to perform a Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) during which multiple physiological measurements were recorded. PVTs are standard, validated tasks that require sustained attention and rapid responses to visual or auditory stimuli.

The primary physiological measurements of interest included participants' blood oxygenation, hemodynamics, and CSF flow, measured using fast functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The study also measured electrical brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) and pupil diameter using pupillometry.

Data analyses aimed to generate a second-by-second timeline of the physiological changes in the brain and body that accompany a participant's attention failure.

The study's first major finding was that sleep-deprived participants displayed significantly slower reaction times and more frequent omissions and missed responses than when rested (P < 0.0001).

Analyses of physiological data further revealed that sleep-deprived subjects exhibited sleep-like, large-amplitude, low-frequency oscillatory CSF waves that intruded into wakefulness, rather than sustained directional fluid flow. The power of these fluid waves was statistically similar to that observed during N2 sleep (24.50 dB vs. 24.80 dB).

Approximately two seconds before the documented lapse, the participant's attention abruptly declined. This lapse coincided with pupil constriction and was followed by a large-scale outward pulse of CSF. As the participant regained attention, the pupil dilated, and CSF was observed to flow back into the brain.

Pupil diameter and CSF demonstrated a correlation (r = 0.26). Pupil constriction, indicating low arousal and alertness, coincided with significant changes in brain blood volume. The authors hypothesize that these associations likely reflect a shared neuromodulatory arousal system with vascular mediation rather than a direct causal effect of pupil constriction on CSF movement.

Finally, EEG data obtained during attention lapses showed a substantial reduction in electrical brain activity, particularly in the alpha-beta range (10-25 Hz), which physiologically signals a momentary suppression of cortical excitability, alongside broader spectral changes consistent with transient low-arousal brain states.

Together, these findings suggest that the sleep-deprived brain physiologically mimics a state of ""low arousal,"" usually reserved for sleep. This low-arousal state triggers coupled neurovascular and CSF oscillatory dynamics rather than a demonstrated fluid-clearing process, correlating with a significant drop in cognitive performance.

The present study provides evidence that attentional failures reflect coordinated brain–body state shifts potentially representing an intrinsic sleep-pressure signal rather than merely localized neural glitches, including changes in pupil diameter, vascular dynamics, and CSF pulsations.

The study concludes that these dynamics reflect a central neuromodulatory circuit, potentially involving the noradrenergic system, that modulates both alertness and brain fluid physiology. However, whether these CSF oscillations contribute to the clearance of metabolic waste or to other restorative functions remains unresolved. These findings support public health guidelines that emphasize the importance of sufficient, high-quality sleep.

A major cohort study suggests that consistent adherence to established healthy eating patterns may add years to life, even after accounting for genetic predisposition.



Study: Healthy dietary patterns, longevity genes, and life expectancy: A prospective cohort study. Image Credit: Pacorpi / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in Science Advances, researchers investigated the impact of adherence to five established healthy dietary patterns on life expectancy and mortality, examining whether these associations differed by genetic predisposition to longevity rather than susceptibility to shorter lifespan. Greater adherence to all five dietary patterns was linked to lower mortality and longer life expectancy. These benefits were associated with dietary adherence regardless of genetic predisposition to longevity.

Life expectancy growth has begun to stagnate despite decades of improvement, highlighting the need for effective strategies to reduce premature mortality. Unhealthy diets are a leading global cause of death, making dietary modification a cost-effective and scalable intervention.

Rather than focusing on individual nutrients, contemporary research emphasizes overall dietary patterns, which better capture antagonistic or synergistic effects among foods. Several a priori dietary indices, such as the Diabetes Risk Reduction Diet (DDRD), Alternate Mediterranean Diet (AMED), Alternate Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and healthful Plant-based Diet Index (hPDI), have been associated with lower risks of mortality and multiple chronic diseases.

However, relatively few analyses have translated these associations into absolute measures such as life expectancy, which are more relevant for public health messaging and policy decisions than relative risk estimates. Additionally, genetic factors contribute to longevity, and emerging evidence suggests interactions between genetic predisposition and lifestyle exposures, including diet. Yet, the combined effects of dietary quality and genetic predisposition to longevity on life expectancy remain unclear.

This prospective cohort study used data from the UK Biobank, which recruited over 500,000 adults aged 40–69 years between 2006 and 2010 across the United Kingdom. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated 24-hour recall questionnaire administered on up to five occasions between 2009 and 2012. Participants completing at least two dietary assessments and free from cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline were included (n = 103,649). Those with implausible energy intake were excluded.

Five dietary pattern scores were calculated: AHEI-2010, AMED, hPDI, DASH, and DRRD, using predefined scoring systems that reflect adherence to healthy eating principles. Average intake across assessments was used. Covariates included demographic factors, socioeconomic status, smoking, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), energy intake, alcohol consumption, with additional alcohol adjustment applied specifically to dietary scores that did not include alcohol components, and baseline chronic conditions.

Mortality data were obtained from national registries through November 2022. Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause and cause-specific mortality across quintiles of dietary scores. Life expectancy at age 45 was estimated using life-table methods that integrated UK population mortality rates and adjusted HRs; these estimates were model-derived rather than directly observed survival differences. A polygenic risk score (PRS) for longevity was used to assess gene–diet interactions. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test robustness across multiple assumptions and subgroups.

Over a median follow-up of 10.6 years, resulting in 1,094,467 person-years, 4,314 deaths occurred. Higher adherence to all five dietary patterns was correlated with lower all-cause mortality after multivariable adjustment. When the highest and lowest quintiles were compared, adjusted HRs ranged from 0.76 (DDRD) to 0.82 (hPDI), indicating an 18–24% lower risk of death. Significant inverse associations were also observed for several cause-specific outcomes, particularly cancer, respiratory, and other-cause mortality.

Life expectancy analyses showed meaningful absolute differences. At age 45, men in the highest versus lowest quintile gained 1.9 to 3.0 years of life, while women gained 1.5 to 2.3 years. The largest gain for men was observed with DDRD, whereas AMED showed the longest gain for women.

Higher longevity PRS was independently associated with lower mortality, 15% lower risk in the highest versus the lowest tertile. Joint analyses indicated that individuals with both high PRS and high dietary scores had the greatest life expectancy. However, no significant additive or multiplicative interactions were detected for most dietary scores, suggesting that healthy dietary patterns are associated with survival benefits regardless of genetic predisposition. An exception was DDRD, which showed a stronger inverse association with mortality among individuals with lower longevity PRS. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of findings across multiple adjustments and restrictions.

This large prospective study demonstrated that greater adherence to five healthy dietary patterns is consistently associated with reduced mortality and extended life expectancy, independent of genetic predisposition to longevity. Absolute gains of up to three additional years at age 45 underscore the public health relevance of sustained dietary quality. DDRD showed slightly stronger associations, although the study did not directly test biological mechanisms and proposed explanations, such as improved glycemic control, remain speculative.

Strengths include a large sample size, repeated dietary assessments, comprehensive adjustment for confounders, integration of genetic data, and the use of life-table methods to estimate absolute life-expectancy differences. However, limitations include reliance on 24-hour recalls, potential residual confounding, limited ethnic diversity in genetic analyses, and possible overestimation of genetic effects due to sample overlap. Dietary changes over time were not fully captured. In addition, UK Biobank participants may not fully represent the general population, which could affect the generalizability of the findings.

In conclusion, adherence to established healthy dietary patterns is associated with longer life expectancy, regardless of genetic predisposition to longevity. These findings support public health recommendations promoting high-quality diets as a flexible and accessible strategy for extending life span, while recognizing that observational studies cannot establish causality and should be interpreted accordingly.

A new review explores how cocoa flavanols may influence cardiovascular and hepatic risk pathways, while highlighting the limitations of current clinical evidence.



Review: Beyond Taste: The Impact of Chocolate on Cardiovascular and Steatotic Liver Disease Risk Factors. Image Credit: Pixel-Shot / Shutterstock

In a recent review published in the journal Nutrients, a group of authors evaluated the impact of cocoa-rich dark chocolate on cardiovascular disease and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease risk factors.

Cardiovascular disease has been the leading cause of death worldwide, while metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease affects more than 30% of adults globally.

Common risk factors such as oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, dyslipidemia, obesity, insulin resistance, and hypertension impact both diseases. These common risk factors are associated with increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, and progression of fatty liver disease, rather than the proven effects of chocolate consumption itself, and increased health care costs.

Although many medications are at the forefront of treatment, including the recent approval of resmetirom for selected noncirrhotic MASH patients, while most MASLD management still relies heavily on lifestyle approaches, many people are looking for low-cost dietary means that may accompany ""standard"" treatment. 

Dark chocolate with high cocoa content has been proposed as a functional dietary component rather than a primary therapy. The strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of the bioactive compounds in cocoa-rich dark chocolate warrant further research to determine whether they confer cardiometabolic protection.

Dark chocolate, derived from Theobroma cacao, is rich in bioactive compounds, including flavanols such as epicatechin, catechin, and procyanidins. It also contains phenolic acids, flavonols, phytosterols, and methylxanthines, including theobromine and caffeine. These substances have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory, and metabolic properties.

Polyphenols in dark chocolate neutralize reactive oxygen species and reduce oxidative stress, a central mechanism underlying atherosclerosis and liver injury. By negatively affecting the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL-6), they regulate inflammatory pathways. They also boost the bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO), which leads to greater vascular dilation and improved endothelial function.

Treatments such as fermentation, roasting, and conching influence flavanol concentration. Dark chocolate is more biologically active than milk or white chocolate when the cocoa content is 70% or higher.

Oxidative stress occurs when reactive oxygen species overwhelm antioxidant defenses, damaging lipids, proteins, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, and liver fat accumulation may result from this imbalance. Increased activity of antioxidant enzymes has been observed following dark chocolate intake, including glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase.

Flavanols also inhibit inflammatory mediators, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. Cocoa compounds suppress inflammatory signaling pathways by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2, lipoxygenase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. These molecular actions are relevant because chronic low-grade inflammation is linked to obesity, fatty liver, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.

For individuals at metabolic risk, even modest reductions in oxidative and inflammatory burden may slow disease progression, based primarily on biomarker evidence rather than on demonstrated reductions in clinical outcomes.

Metabolic impairment encompasses abnormal lipid levels and reduced glucose metabolism. Clinical trials suggest that moderate amounts of dark chocolate may reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels and raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. This may be partly due to reduced low-density lipoprotein oxidation and increased endothelial production of NO.

Evidence on glycemic control is mixed. Some studies report modest reductions in postprandial glucose and improvements in insulin sensitivity, potentially mediated by glucagon-like peptide-1 modulation and gut microbiota interactions, although these mechanisms remain preliminary and not fully established clinically. Effects appear dose-dependent and vary according to cocoa concentration.

Excess chocolate consumption increases calorie, sugar, and fat intake, potentially offsetting any metabolic benefit.

Hypertension significantly increases cardiovascular risk. Flavanols in cocoa stimulate NO production and suppress angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, both of which are important for improving vasodilation and lowering blood pressure. Randomized crossover trials have demonstrated improvements in flow-mediated dilation following dark chocolate consumption.

Improved endothelial function reduces arterial stiffness and enhances vascular reactivity. Some studies report reduced levels of N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide in patients with heart failure. However, findings are inconsistent in individuals with advanced heart disease or those taking multiple medications.

These findings suggest that dark chocolate may confer greater benefits in early-stage cardiometabolic dysfunction than in established chronic disease and should not be interpreted as evidence of reduced cardiovascular events.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease is characterized by hepatic fat accumulation, inflammation, and oxidative injury. Small randomized trials report that dark chocolate reduces markers of oxidative stress, endotoxemia, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2 activity, and hepatocyte apoptosis in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

These intermediate improvements suggest potential protective effects along the gut-liver-heart axis, but current evidence remains insufficient to support chocolate as a therapeutic or preventive strategy for MASLD or fibrosis progression. Most studies are short-term and involve small samples, limiting conclusions about fibrosis progression or long-term liver outcomes.

Although multiple trials show improvements in surrogate biomarkers, flow-mediated dilation, platelet reactivity, and lipid parameters, most studies are short (2-12 weeks), involve small cohorts, and employ heterogeneous flavanol doses. Chocolate's identifiable sensory properties complicate placebo-controlled blinding and may introduce expectancy effects.

Additional limitations include restricted study populations, incomplete dietary control, which may introduce potential confounding, and possible attenuation of effects among patients receiving multiple cardiometabolic medications.

Benefits appear stronger in primary prevention settings than in medicated populations with advanced cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes mellitus. No large-scale, long-term randomized controlled trials have confirmed reductions in hard clinical endpoints such as myocardial infarction or liver fibrosis progression.

The evidence indicates that moderate consumption of cocoa-rich dark chocolate may beneficially influence oxidative stress, inflammation, lipid metabolism, endothelial function, and selected markers of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.

These effects are relevant for potential cardiometabolic risk modulation rather than established disease treatment and are derived mainly from short-term studies assessing surrogate biomarkers rather than definitive clinical endpoints. 

Large, long-duration randomized controlled studies using standardized flavanol formulations are required before definitive clinical recommendations can be made. Dark chocolate may be incorporated into an otherwise healthy dietary pattern, but should not be considered a substitute therapy.

Bacteria have evolved to adapt to all of Earth's most extreme conditions, from scorching heat to temperatures well below zero. Ice caves are just one of the environments hosting a variety of microorganisms that represent a source of genetic diversity that has not yet been studied extensively.

Now, researchers in Romania tested antibiotic resistance profiles of a bacterial strain that until recently was hidden in a 5,000-year-old layer of ice of an underground ice cave – and found it could be an opportunity for developing new strategies to prevent the rise of antibiotic resistance and study how resistance naturally evolves and spreads. They reported their discovery in Frontiers in Microbiology.

The Psychrobacter SC65A.3 bacterial strain isolated from Scarisoara Ice Cave, despite its ancient origin, shows resistance to multiple modern antibiotics and carries over 100 resistance-related genes. But it can also inhibit the growth of several major antibiotic-resistant 'superbugs' and showed important enzymatic activities with important biotechnological potential.""

Dr. Cristina Purcarea, author, senior scientist, Institute of Biology Bucharest, Romanian Academy

Psychrobacter SC65A.3 is a strain of the genus Psychrobacter, which are bacteria adapted to cold environments. Some species can cause infections in humans or animals. Psychrobacter bacteria have biotechnological potential, but the antibiotic resistance profiles of these bacteria are largely unknown. ""Studying microbes such as Psychrobacter SC65A.3 retrieved from millennia-old cave ice deposits reveals how antibiotic resistance evolved naturally in the environment, long before modern antibiotics were ever used,"" said Purcarea.

The team drilled a 25-meter ice core from the area of the cave known as the Great Hall, representing a 13,000-year timeline. To avoid contamination, the ice fragments taken from the core were placed in sterile bags and kept frozen on their way back to the lab. There, the researchers isolated various bacterial strains and sequenced their genome to determine which genes allow the strain to survive in low temperatures and which confer antimicrobial resistance and activity.

They tested for resistance of the SC65A strain against 28 antibiotics from 10 classes that are routinely used to or reserved for treating bacterial infections, including antibiotics that have previously been identified to possess resistance genes or mutations that give them the ability to resist drug effects. This way, they could test whether predicted mechanisms translated into measurable resistance. ""The 10 antibiotics we found resistance to are widely used in oral and injectable therapies used to treat a range of serious bacterial infections in clinical practice,"" Purcarea pointed out. Diseases such as tuberculosis, colitis, and UTIs can be treated with some of the antibiotics that the researchers found resistance to, including rifampicin, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin.

SC65A.3 is the first Psychrobacter strain for which resistance to certain antibiotics – including trimethoprim, clindamycin, and metronidazole – was found. Those antibiotics are used to treat UTIs, infections of lungs, skin, or blood, and the reproductive system. SC65A.3's resistance profile suggests that strains capable of surviving in cold environments could act as reservoirs of resistance genes which are specific DNA sequences that help them survive exposure to drugs.

Bacterial strains like the one examined here hold both a threat and a promise. ""If melting ice releases these microbes, these genes could spread to modern bacteria, adding to the global challenge of antibiotic resistance,"" Purcarea said. ""On the other hand, they produce unique enzymes and antimicrobial compounds that could inspire new antibiotics, industrial enzymes, and other biotechnological innovations.""

In the Psychrobacter SC65A.3 genome, the researchers found almost 600 genes with unknown functions, suggesting a yet untapped source for discovering novel biological mechanisms. Analysis of the genome also revealed 11 genes that are potentially able to kill or stop the growth of other bacteria, fungi, and viruses.

Such potential is becoming ever more important in a world where antibiotic resistance is a growing concern. Going back to ancient genomes and uncovering their potential highlights the important role the natural environment played in the spread and evolution of antibiotic resistance. ""These ancient bacteria are essential for science and medicine,"" Purcarea concluded, ""but careful handling and safety measures in the lab are essential to mitigate the risk of uncontrolled spread.""

PulpFixin®, a materials science company focused on replacing single-use plastics in life science laboratories, will debut a slate of new automation-ready, compostable lab products at the 2026 SLAS International Conference and Exhibition in Boston, expanding its footprint across liquid handling, sample identification and cold storage workflows.

The announcement builds on the company's recent launch of the world's first fully paperbased automation pipet tip rack engineered for Agilent Bravo automated liquid handlers.

That product has been selected by SLAS as a finalist for its 2026 New Product of the Year Award, with the winner to be announced during the conference. The success of this product provides a foundation upon which other automation compatible pipet tip racks can be built.

In addition to the automation pipet tip rack, PulpFixin will formally introduce AutoSleeve™ tube adapters and the 2D AutoBox™ sample storage system, both designed to modernize sample tracking and inventory management while eliminating unnecessary plastic from laboratory operations.

Labs shouldn't have to choose between automation performance and sustainability, Each of these products was designed to integrate directly into existing workflows, not disrupt them. That's how real change happens in science - by making better materials the easier choice.""

Chad Jenkins, CEO, PulpFixin

For decades, laboratories have relied on polypropylene racks, boxes and labeling systems that are difficult to recycle due to contamination and limited infrastructure. Millions of these components are discarded each year, contributing significantly to laboratory waste streams across biotech and pharmaceutical research environments.

PulpFixin's paper-based automation pipet tip rack addresses one of the most persistent sources of plastic waste in automated liquid handling. The rack is manufactured entirely from paper materials and is fully recyclable through standard paper and cardboard streams, as well as industrially compostable. It serves as a direct replacement for traditional plastic racks used with Agilent Bravo systems, requiring no equipment modifications.

The rack is sealed with FeatureFilm™, PulpFixin's proprietary moisture-resistant coating, which encapsulates paper fibers to provide structural integrity, durability and particulate control while maintaining compatibility with automated systems.

The company's newly announced AutoSleeve™ and 2D AutoBox™ products extend that same material science approach into sample identification, sample management and cold storage. AutoSleeve™ adapters allow laboratories to assign durable, unique serialized 1D and 2D barcodes to standard 1.5- to 2.0-milliliter conical bottom microcentrifuge tubes without relying on plastic labels or costly pre-barcoded tubes. The sleeves pair with the 2D AutoBox™, a compostable, ANSI-SLAS standard footprint storage box designed for standard microplate freezer racks and automated barcode reading.

Both products are moisture resistant, compatible with 2D and 1D barcode readers and validated for use in extreme cold storage conditions, including liquid nitrogen environments.

SLAS' selection of the automation pipet tip rack as a New Product of the Year finalist underscores the growing interest in sustainable alternatives that do not compromise performance in high-throughput laboratories.

""Being named a finalist by SLAS is a meaningful validation of the work our team is doing,"" Jenkins said. ""It signals that sustainability and automation can move forward together - and that the industry is ready for better materials.""

All three products - the paper-based automation pipet tip rack, AutoSleeve™ and 2D AutoBox™ - will be showcased at SLAS2026 in Boston, Feb. 7-11. PulpFixin will exhibit at Booth 1856.

The automation pipet tip racks are available beginning Feb. 7, 2026. AutoSleeve™ and AutoBox™ products will be available following the SLAS conference in February.

Recent research reveals that nuclear speckles play a key role in modifying viral messenger RNAs and in their transport out of the nucleus; therefore, nuclear speckles are an important subject of study in understanding viral infections.

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection dramatically remodels the host cell's nuclear structures. Infection leads to the formation of viral replication compartments and to chromatin marginalization to the nuclear periphery. In addition, a joint research by the Universities of Jyväskylä and Bar-Ilan revealed that viral infection also alters the structure of nuclear speckles, which are essential for messenger RNA processing.

- Nuclear speckles are dynamic, membraneless nuclear bodies that primarily function as sites for the storage, assembly, and modification of factors involved in gene expression. Both cellular and viral messenger RNAs are processed in nuclear speckles. The disassembly of nuclear speckles severely limits the export of viral messenger RNAs from the nucleus, explains Research Director Maija Vihinen-Ranta from the University of Jyväskylä.

Altogether, the research indicates that nuclear speckles function as intermediate hubs for the modification of viral messenger RNAs, thereby highlighting their essential role in viral messenger RNA processing and nuclear export pathways. Without them, virus cannot function normally, and infection cannot progress.

- A better understanding of how viruses interact with host cells and exploit their cellular machinery can help us develop new ways to treat and prevent viral diseases, says Vihinen-Ranta.

The study was published in the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) journal and was conducted in cooperation Professor Shav-Tal's research group Bar-Ilan University (Israel).

The research was financed by the National Institute of Health (USA), the Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation, the Academy of Finland, the Erasmus programme of the European Union, and the European Union's Horizon 2020.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Fred Hutch scientists reach crucial milestone in blocking Epstein Barr virus","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260217/Fred-Hutch-scientists-reach-crucial-milestone-in-blocking-Epstein-Barr-virus.aspx","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 17:00:00 GMT","

Fred Hutch Cancer Center scientists reached a crucial milestone in blocking Epstein Barr virus (EBV), a pathogen estimated to infect 95% of the global population that is linked to multiple types of cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and other chronic health conditions.

Using mice with human antibody genes, the research team developed new genetically human monoclonal antibodies that prevent two key antigens on the surface of the virus from binding to and entering human immune cells. Published in Cell Reports Medicine, the study highlights one of the newly identified monoclonal antibodies that successfully blocked infection in mice with human immune systems when they were challenged with EBV.

Finding human antibodies that block Epstein Barr virus from infecting our immune cells has been particularly challenging because, unlike other viruses, EBV finds a way to bind to nearly every one of our B cells. We decided to use new technologies to try to fill this knowledge gap and we ended up taking a critical step toward blocking one of the world's most common viruses.""

Andrew McGuire, PhD, biochemist and cellular biologist in the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division at Fred Hutch

A key challenge in the study was to pursue human monoclonal antibodies that could successfully halt EBV infection without triggering an anti-drug response to the antibodies themselves, a common response among patients treated with antibodies raised in other animals. The researchers targeted two antigens, gp350, which helps EBV bind to cell receptors, and gp42, which allows EBV to enter and infect human cells through a process called fusion. Using an innovative mouse model carrying human antibody genes, the effort yielded two monoclonal antibodies against gp350 and eight against gp42.

""Not only did we identify important antibodies against Epstein Barr virus, but we also validated an innovative a new approach for discovering protective antibodies against other pathogens,"" noted Crystal Chhan, a pathobiology PhD student in the McGuire Lab. ""As an early-career scientist, it was an exciting finding and has helped me appreciate how science often leads to unexpected discoveries.""

With help from Fred Hutch's Antibody Tech Core, further analysis found sites of vulnerability that could be useful in future vaccine development. In the final step of the study, the research team discovered that one of the monoclonal antibodies against gp42 successfully prevented infection of EBV. Another monoclonal antibody against gp350 provided partial protection.

More than 128,000 people in the U.S. undergo solid organ and bone marrow transplant annually. However, there are no specific therapies to prevent EBV from infecting or reactivating in patients undergoing immunosuppression for transplant procedures. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) are an aggressive and sometimes life-threatening lymphoma that can develop after immune suppression and is most often caused by unchecked EBV infection.

""Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD), most of which are EBV-associated lymphomas, are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality after organ transplantation,"" noted Rachel Bender Ignacio, MD, MPH, an associate professor and infectious disease physician at Fred Hutch and University of Washington School of Medicine. ""Preventing EBV viremia has strong potential to reduce the incidence of PTLD and limit the need to reduce immunosuppression, thereby helping preserve graft function while improving overall patient outcomes. Effective prevention of EBV viremia remains a significant unmet need in transplant medicine.""

Transplant recipients may experience infection if their donor was exposed to EBV and passed on latent virus through the donor cells, or for transplant patients who already have had EBV infection, immunosuppression may cause latent virus in their bodies to replicate unchecked. Children undergoing immunosuppression for transplant could especially benefit from a specific therapy to prevent EBV, as a higher proportion of children have not yet been exposed to EBV.

The scientists envision a future therapy in which an infusion of these monoclonal antibodies could prevent PTLD by blocking EBV infection and activation in the patient populations who face the highest risk of EBV-related complications.

Fred Hutch has filed for intellectual property rights covering monoclonal antibodies identified in the study, and McGuire and Chhan are working with scientific collaborators and an industry partner to advance a potential therapy for immunocompromised patients. A potential therapy could be tested for safety in healthy adult volunteers and, if acceptable, proceed to clinical trials in the relevant patient population.

""There's momentum to advance our discovery to a therapy that would make a huge difference for patients undergoing transplant,"" said McGuire. ""After many years of searching for a viable way to protect against Epstein Barr virus, this is a significant stride for the scientific community and the people at the highest risk of complications from this virus.""

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®) today published new NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) for Pediatric Soft Tissue Sarcomas. This is the 7th NCCN Guidelines® for a pediatric cancer, expanding the overall library to cover 91 topics in cancer care. The guidelines present the latest evidence-based, expert consensus-driven recommendations for nearly every type of cancer plus prevention, screening, survivorship, and supportive care. NCCN Guidelines are updated at least once a year and help cancer care providers worldwide to attain the best possible outcomes.

The new NCCN Guidelines® for Pediatric Soft Tissue Sarcomas is now available for free at NCCN.org. They focus on a subtype called rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) which is the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma in people under 20. RMS represents nearly 5% of all childhood cancers. 

""Most cancers that occur in children are fundamentally different from cancers occurring in adults,"" explained Stephen Skapek, MD, Duke Cancer Institute, Chair of the NCCN Guidelines Panel for Pediatric Soft Tissue Sarcoma. ""RMS can be divided into specific subtypes that are driven by different genetic changes that can influence outcomes. Those changes and other clinical and pathology features are all incorporated into the multi-faceted treatments. That's why it was essential to form a group of leading, multi-disciplinary experts from across the country to put together a roadmap for diagnosing, risk stratifying, and treating these patients.""

Children are most likely to be diagnosed with RMS at a very young age, toddlers or early elementary school. When treating someone so young, you are not looking to just prolong survival, the goal is a full cure with minimal side effects and zero recurrence.""

Douglas Hawkins, MD, Panel Vice-Chair, Seattle Children's

RMS is tricky to diagnose; it can be located almost anywhere on the body. When it presents in the head, neck, or limb, it can show up as a lump with or without pain. Other times it occurs on an internal organ, which might cause problems for breathing or urination. There are three major risk groups with varying survival rates. The intensity of the treatment, which typically includes chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy, must be tailored to the risk group as well as the age and the patient's developmental stage, which might be influenced by the treatment. The new NCCN Guidelines explain how to provide treatment in a way that balances the goal of cure with the need to minimize acute side effects, such as severe infections, and long-term effects that could bring additional problems at some point in the future.

Insilico Medicine (""Insilico"", 3696.HK), a clinical-stage generative artificial intelligence (AI)-driven drug discovery company, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) have entered into a collaborative research agreement aimed at discovering new therapeutic targets for gastroesophageal malignancies. The initiative builds on MSK's global leadership in this field under the direction of Yelena Y. Janjigian, MD, Carroll and Milton Petrie Chair; Chief, GI Oncology; and Founding Director of the MSK GEC Therapeutics Accelerator, whose group has delivered multiple practice-changing advances in gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers. Patrick Evans, BS, MBA, Senior Project Manager in the Janjigian Lab, will serve as the MSK project lead, supporting integration of scientific, operational, and translational efforts across teams.

Insilico Medicine's multidisciplinary team will utilize its PandaOmics platform and other proprietary tools to accelerate the discovery of new disease mechanisms and target hypotheses. PandaOmics is an AI-driven biological data analysis platform developed and designed to accelerate drug target discovery by integrating advanced, multi-dimensional artificial intelligence (AI) and bioinformatics models with multimodal omics and biomedical text data for therapeutic target and biomarker identification. The platform utilizes over 20 proprietary AI and bioinformatic models to systematically prioritize druggable biological targets with high translational potential.

A central strength of the project is the integration of MSK's extensive multi-omic clinical datasets into PandaOmics. MSK contributes high quality patient genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data and deeply annotated clinical cohorts, providing a rich foundation for systematic analysis and identification of disease drivers across diverse GEC subtypes. By combining MSK's world-class clinical and translational expertise with Insilico's AI powered platforms, the joint project teams aim to uncover actionable targets and biological pathways that may lead to future personalized therapeutic options and improved outcomes for patients with gastroesophageal cancers.

The collaboration is currently centered on data gathering, quality control, and integration. Subsequent phases anticipate involving AI driven hypothesis generation, target ranking, and detailed biological investigation. The project also supports the evaluation and advancement of identified targets across a range of therapeutic modalities, including biologics and small molecules.

""This collaboration with MSKbrings together leading clinical oncology expertise with our generative AI platforms,"" said Alex Zhavoronkov, PhD, Founder and CEO of Insilico Medicine. ""Gastroesophageal cancers remain among the most challenging solid tumors. By integrating MSK's exceptional clinical data resources with our target discovery technologies, we aim to identify meaningful biological insights and accelerate the development of new therapeutic options for patients worldwide.""

Reflecting on the collaboration, Dr. Janjigian noted: ""GEC patients need new breakthroughs, and those breakthroughs must come from a deeper understanding of each patient's unique disease biology. By combining patient-level clinical and molecular data with transformative AI tools, we can accelerate the discovery of clinically meaningful targets and move more personalized therapies toward patients who need them most, in real time and faster.""

Harnessing state-of-the-art AI and automation technologies, Insilico has significantly improved the efficiency of preclinical drug development, setting a benchmark for AI-driven drug R&D. While traditional early-stage drug discovery typically requires an average of 4.5 years, Insilico has nominated 20 preclinical candidates from 2021 to 2024, with an average timeline-from project initiation to preclinical candidate (PCC) nomination-of just 12 to 18 months per program, with only 60 to 200 molecules synthesized and tested in each program.

Artificial intelligence has moved well beyond early excitement and is now used throughout modern laboratories. Scientists routinely rely on generative models to synthesize complex results, draft protocols, and think through possible next steps in an experimental series.

What's increasingly striking is not that these tools are being used, but where much of that use is happening. In many labs, interpretive work is drifting away from the official experimental record and into public, unmanaged tools.

This pattern is often labeled “shadow AI,” a term that suggests a lapse in discipline or a breakdown in oversight. That framing misses the mark. In practice, unmanaged AI use reflects less a failure of governance and more a mismatch in system design. Scientific interpretation is often easier to carry out outside formal platforms than within them, even when those platforms are meant to anchor day-to-day lab work.

Most laboratories have made real progress on documentation. Electronic lab notebooks are generally effective at capturing the mechanics of an experiment: methods, raw outputs, and the metadata required for compliance. Yet the most consequential part of scientific work often begins only after results are recorded.

Interpretation requires comparison across runs, reconciliation of anomalies, and rapid judgment about what to do next. These are time-sensitive, cognitively demanding tasks. When performing them inside governed tools feels slow or cumbersome, researchers adapt.

In practice, that adaptation increasingly involves public generative AI tools. They are fast, conversational, and well-suited to synthesis.

Research into lab workflows reflects this shift. AI use is now nearly universal, with 97 percent of lab professionals reporting some form of AI to support their work. More notably, 77 percent say they use public generative AI tools alongside their electronic lab notebooks. Nearly half report doing so through personal accounts rather than company-managed access.

This is not fringe behavior. It is a pragmatic response by experienced scientists who encounter friction in formal systems and prioritize speed when decisions need to be made.

The implications of this shift go beyond security or compliance. The more lasting concern is what happens to scientific reasoning over time.

When interpretation happens in external tools, and only the final conclusions are entered into the notebook, much of the thinking behind those conclusions never makes it back into the record. Discarded hypotheses, “what-if” scenarios, and the context behind key decisions stay outside the system. What gets saved is the answer, not the reasoning that led there.

Over time, that starts to thin out the scientific record. The next researcher can see what was concluded, but not how the team got there. Confidence in reuse begins to slip. Experiments get repeated, not because replication is scientifically necessary, but because earlier work can't be quickly evaluated or trusted in context.

Data has been found to back this up. Sixty-five percent of lab professionals say they've repeated experiments or assays because previous results were hard to find or reuse with confidence. The issue isn't a lack of data. It's missing context and fragmented reasoning.

Public generative AI tools can be genuinely helpful while still poorly aligned with scientific workflows. Their limitations are arguably more structural than technical.

General-purpose models lack embedded experimental context. They do not know which dataset version is authoritative, how a specific instrument has behaved over time, or which methods have been formally validated within a given organization. They also do not automatically preserve provenance or decision rationale.

This mismatch helps explain a paradox in current adoption. Despite widespread use, only 27 percent of scientists say existing AI tools meet their scientific needs very well. This means that these tools are only being used because they reduce friction, not because they are designed for governed scientific reasoning.

Institutional responses to unmanaged AI use often focus on restriction. New policies and outright bans may reduce visible usage, but they rarely address the underlying demand. When high-value interpretive work isn't well supported inside governed systems, it doesn't stop happening. It simply moves somewhere else.

A more sustainable approach is to redesign workflows so interpretation happens where experiments are documented and reviewed. This is the logic behind third-generation, science-aware lab notebooks. Rather than treating AI as an external add-on, these platforms embed AI-assisted reasoning directly into the notebook environment, alongside experimental context and audit trails.

Sapio Sciences' ELaiN reflects this direction. By integrating science-aware AI within the lab notebook and connecting it to a broader ecosystem of analytical and domain-specific tools, the goal is to support interpretation without fragmenting the record. Reasoning is captured alongside the experimental data, making it easier to review, validate, and reuse over time.

When the notebook becomes the easiest place to think through scientific results, the incentive to rely on unmanaged workarounds diminishes. The objective is to ensure that when AI is used to summarize, compare, or plan, logic remains part of the institutional memory.

Unmanaged AI use is best understood as a symptom. It reveals where current tools have failed to keep pace with how science is actually practiced. Addressing it requires less emphasis on enforcement and more attention to workflow design that respects how scientists reason, decide, and move forward.

Sapio Sciences' mission is to improve lives by accelerating discovery, and because science is complex, Sapio makes technology simple. Sapio is a global business offering an all-in-one science-aware (TM) lab informatics platform combining cloud-based LIMS, ELN, and SDMS.

Harlequin ichthyosis (HI) is a rare, severe genetic skin disorder caused by ABCA12 mutations, leading to defective lipid transport and loss of skin barrier function. Infants present with thick, armor-like plates, deep fissures, ectropion, and eclabium, with high risks of dehydration, infection, and respiratory failure. Historically fatal, survival has improved with neonatal intensive care and systemic retinoids. This review covers pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, management, genetic counseling, and emerging gene-based therapies.

HI is the most severe form of congenital ichthyosis. Newborns are encased in rigid hyperkeratotic scales that compromise barrier function, leading to life-threatening complications. Recent advances in neonatal care and retinoid therapy have enabled long-term survival, and the genetic basis-ABCA12 mutations disrupting epidermal lipid transport-is now well established.

ABCA12 encodes a lipid transporter in keratinocyte lamellar granules. In HI, loss-of-function mutations prevent glucosylceramide transport, impairing formation of the stratum corneum lipid barrier. This triggers compensatory keratinocyte hyperproliferation, massive keratin accumulation, and retention of corneocytes. The resulting rigid plates restrict chest expansion, while fissures permit fluid loss and pathogen entry.

Newborns display pathognomonic thick, yellow-white plates separated by deep erythematous fissures, severe ectropion, eclabium, flattened ears/nose, and joint contractures. Complications include respiratory distress, feeding failure, dehydration, temperature instability, and sepsis. Long-term, survivors face persistent hyperkeratosis, scarring, ocular issues, and psychosocial burden.

Prenatal diagnosis via CVS or amniocentesis detects ABCA12 mutations in at-risk families. Postnatal diagnosis is clinical, confirmed by genetic testing to distinguish HI from other ichthyoses.

Neonatal care focuses on fluid balance, infection prevention, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Systemic retinoids (oral acitretin) initiated early are disease-modifying, accelerating scale shedding and improving pliability. Daily emollients, keratolytics, and wound care are essential. Ophthalmologic lubrication and surgical correction address ectropion; physical therapy manages contractures. Psychosocial support is critical.

Historically fatal, survival now extends into adulthood with aggressive care. Quality of life varies; long-term retinoid use requires monitoring for hepatotoxicity and skeletal effects. Chronic skin fragility and social integration remain challenges.

HI is autosomal recessive; carrier parents have 25% recurrence risk. Reproductive options include prenatal diagnosis and preimplantation genetic testing. Counseling provides recurrence risk assessment and emotional support for informed decision-making.

Gene therapy and CRISPR-Cas9 correction of ABCA12 in patient-derived cells are under investigation. Stem cell-based approaches using gene-corrected induced pluripotent stem cells for autologous skin equivalents show promise. Novel pharmacologies targeting alternative lipid pathways and nanotechnology-based topical delivery are early in development. International registries and standardized outcomes are urgently needed.

HI has transformed from a universally fatal neonatal condition to a chronic, manageable disease. Advances in neonatal care, retinoids, and multidisciplinary support have improved survival and quality of life. Genetic counseling empowers families, and emerging gene-based therapies offer hope for definitive correction. Continued research and equitable access to care remain essential.

Nuclera, the biotechnology company enabling rapid access to high-quality proteins and leadXpro, a specialist in structure-based drug discovery for membrane proteins, today announced a scientific partnership. The collaboration brings together eProtein Discovery's™ rapid multiplex membrane protein screening with leadXpro's AI/ML-driven construct design and membrane protein expertise to advance structural studies and therapeutic development.

Membrane proteins remain among the most valuable yet difficult to obtain drug targets. These proteins are notoriously challenging to express and purify in sufficient quantity and quality for structural biology and biophysical studies, limiting drug discovery programs even when promising biology is well understood.

Integrating eProtein Discovery's Cell-Free Protein Synthesis multiplex screening technology with leadXpro's AI/ML and biophysical and structural characterization expertise, the partnership will establish an AI-guided, iterative, end-to-end workflow. The workflow will link in silico construct design with rapid, experimental multiplex screening to accelerate and de-risk challenging membrane protein programs, shortening the path to structural and biophysical insights for structure-based drug discovery.

Membrane protein constructs will be screened using Nuclera's eProtein Discovery System with the most promising variants undergoing detailed biophysical characterization and high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination led by leadXpro. Insights from these studies will be integrated into AI/ML models for construct design and stability predictions, improving yields, functionality, and success rates. The partnership will also inform future integration of AI/ML capabilities into Nuclera's product portfolio to embed predictive design into the eProtein Discovery System, and strengthen leadXpro's platform in rapidly producing and characterizing difficult membrane protein targets.

Scientists are under pressure to progress increasingly complex membrane protein programs faster. By partnering with leadXpro, we can pair AI/ML-driven construct design with our rapid multiplex membrane protein screening to provide a truly 'lab-in-loop' workflow. This collaboration is an important step towards embedding AI/ML into Nuclera's system so that researchers can go from sequence to high-value structural and functional insights in a fraction of the time currently required.""

Dr Michael Chen, CEO and Co-Founder, Nuclera

Dr Michael Hennig, CEO, leadXpro, commented: ""Access to well-optimized membrane protein constructs is critical for producing high-quality proteins that enable biophysical and structural biology studies. Nuclera's eProtein Discovery platform provides a robust, rapid, and reproducible approach to exploring construct space. Combined with our established AI/ML and structural biology expertise, this integration allows us to support better design decisions earlier and accelerate the progression of promising drug candidates.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Canadian study reveals how COVID-19 lockdowns masked child maltreatment","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260217/Canadian-study-reveals-how-COVID-19-lockdowns-masked-child-maltreatment.aspx","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 12:08:00 GMT","

Hospital admissions for maltreatment of children under the age of 2 years declined 31% during the 16-week lockdown at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, returning to prepandemic levels after restrictions lifted, according to new research published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.251317.

However, after the 16-week period of restricted health care access, rates of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for child maltreatment increased by 80%.

""We consider that the observed decrease and subsequent stabilization in hospital admission incidence rate during the pandemic may be attributable to delayed case identification or lack of admissions to investigate more minor injuries, rather than a true decline in the population incidence of child maltreatment - young children experiencing maltreatment that may have warranted hospital admission did not appear to present to care during the period of restricted health care access,"" writes pediatrician Dr. Matthew Carwana, BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, British Columbia, with coauthors. ""This early underdetection, as well as ongoing pandemic-related stress, may have led to the subsequent increase in ICU admissions.""

The strict public health measures enacted during the first period of the pandemic disrupted normal routines, closing schools, restricting access to primary care physicians, and increasing household stress and parental isolation. These factors could lead to increased child maltreatment, yet few studies have examined the impact of the pandemic on child maltreatment.

Researchers from POPCORN (Pediatric Outcomes Improvement Through Coordination of Research Networks) compared hospital admissions in the pandemic period from Mar. 1, 2020, to Mar. 25, 2023, with the prepandemic period (Apr. 3, 2016, to Feb. 29, 2020) using data from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) for all provinces and territories except Quebec, and from l'Institut national d'excellence en santé et en services sociaux (INESSS) for Quebec. A total of 1518 hospital admissions for child maltreatment occurred in children younger than 2 years out of about 750 000 children in this age range in the country.

As admissions to ICUs increased after the 16-week period of health care restrictions ended, it may indicate child maltreatment during this phase of the pandemic.

""This raises concern that children may have been living in unsafe situations or experiencing abuse that went undetected during the period of the most stringent public health measures. It also highlights the potential importance of hospital admissions for assessment of sentinel injuries consistent with child maltreatment that could prompt action to prevent more severe presentations,"" the authors write.

They suggest that, in preparing for potential future pandemics, planners should ensure there are mechanisms to identify cases of child maltreatment, even during periods of public health restrictions.

New Australian research suggests that foods naturally rich in live microbes may be associated with better metabolic health, offering fresh insight into diet, microbiome interactions, and chronic disease risk. 



Study: Association between dietary intake of foods estimated to contain live microbes and health indicators in Australian adults: An exploratory analysis. Image Credit: UliAb / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrition Research, researchers investigated associations between the intake of foods containing live microbes (LMs) and health indicators in Australians, with a primary aim of developing a database to estimate LM content in Australian foods and beverages and a secondary exploratory aim of examining health associations.

LMs are naturally present in many common foods, including raw vegetables and fruits, fermented foods, and probiotics. Interest in the intake of LM-containing foods has surged in recent years, given their associations with health and disease risk. High consumption of beneficial LMs has been associated with a lower risk of mortality in previous observational studies, particularly analyses of US population cohorts rather than Australian samples. However, most research on dietary LM intake has focused on American populations or specific foods rather than the whole diet.

In the present study, researchers assessed associations between dietary LM intake and health indicators in Australians. First, they developed a database of LM content for common foods and beverages from the Australian Food and Nutrient (AUSNUT) database, relevant to the Australian Eating Survey (AES). Next, food and beverage items were stratified into low, medium, or high LM categories based on the expected prevalence of viable microbes, using previously published methods; microbial levels were estimated indirectly rather than directly measured in individual food samples.

The low category had an estimated microbial count of < 10⁴ colony-forming units per gram (CFU/g); the medium and high categories had counts of 10⁴-10⁷ CFU/g and > 10⁷ CFU/g, respectively. These data were then used in an exploratory cross-sectional analysis to investigate the relationship between estimated dietary LM intake and health indicators. Data from adults recruited in 2019-20 from the Newcastle region of Australia were analyzed.

Participants were aged 18 years or older and had a stable weight over the past two months. Individuals who were trying to conceive, pregnant, or breastfeeding, those taking medications affecting weight, fluid balance, or metabolic rate, and those with food allergies, chronic medical conditions, certain implanted medical devices, claustrophobia, or other protocol-specified exclusions were excluded. Participants reported demographic data and dietary intake using the AES Food Frequency Questionnaire, a validated instrument that may nonetheless overestimate some dietary intakes due to self-reporting.

The following cardiometabolic health indicators were measured: body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting insulin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Estimated inflammatory markers included interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and C-reactive protein (CRP).

Differences in consumption of LM-containing foods by gender, smoking status, and ethnicity were assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney U test. To explore relationships between estimated LM content categories and health indicators, Spearman's rank correlation was first used to assess the direction of association. Subsequently, weighted least-squares (WLS) regression was used, adjusting for relevant covariates, including gender, smoking status, and energy intake, to account for potential confounding; however, residual confounding cannot be excluded in observational analyses.

The team categorized more than 200 food items from the AUSNUT database to create the LM database. About 229 items were classified as having low LM content, including vegetables, cereal-based products, and meat, poultry, and game products. Additionally, 21 items, including fruits, vegetables, and milk products, had medium LM content.

Of the five fermented foods, two were classified as high LM content and three as medium. Given the limited number of high-LM foods, the medium- and high-LM food groups were aggregated (Med/Hi) to improve statistical power, with yogurt remaining the only clearly high-LM food after grouping. The study included 58 adults, predominantly Caucasian (86%) and female (69%), with a mean age of 38.16 years and a BMI of 26.18 kg/m2. Participants reported relatively higher fruit and vegetable intake than typically observed in the broader Australian population.

Participants primarily consumed the low LM food group (mean daily intake, 1,902 g), followed by the medium LM group (253.6 g/day). Males consumed significantly more low-LM foods than females, and non-smokers had significantly higher intake of Med/Hi LM foods than smokers. Consumption of the low-LM food group was positively correlated with BP.

By contrast, intakes of the medium and Med/Hi-LM food groups were positively correlated with HDL-C and negatively correlated with BMI, fasting insulin, body weight, waist circumference, CRP, and IL-6, although inflammatory marker associations did not remain statistically significant after covariate adjustment, and HDL-C associations remained statistically significant in adjusted analyses. WLS regression showed that consumption of the Med/Hi-LM food group was significantly inversely associated with BMI, insulin, and waist circumference, and positively associated with HDL-C. No significant adjusted associations were observed with fasting glucose, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, or TNF-α.

In summary, more frequent intake of foods with high or medium LM content was positively associated with HDL-C and inversely associated with insulin levels, BMI, waist circumference, and body weight in this Australian sample.

Further research is needed to corroborate these findings across larger, diverse populations and to determine whether dietary LM intake is associated with changes in the gut microbiota, particularly given the exploratory cross-sectional design, relatively small sample size, potential dietary reporting bias, and the inability of observational studies to establish causal relationships.

The psychedelic effects recreational users often seek from taking ketamine do not predict the therapeutic benefits for people being treated for alcohol use disorder.

The popular theory, which says that ketamine may have its therapeutic benefits because it produces strong psychedelic effects, has been called into question by a new study from King's College London and the University of Exeter, published in Addiction. The study suggests the treatment response may be down to other effects of the drug.

The research provides new insights into the use of intravenous ketamine-assisted psychotherapy for individuals with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder. It used data from the Ketamine for reduction of Alcoholic Relapse (KARE) clinical trial at the University of Exeter and University College London, supported by the Medical Research Council.

Dr. Will Lawn, lead of the new published study and Senior Lecturer at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience at King's, said: ""We previously showed that ketamine has promise for helping people with alcohol use disorder remain sober and these new findings demonstrate those receiving intravenous ketamine experience the expected subjective effects from the drug, including feelings of altered reality, bodily dissociation and warped time perception.

""However, our results challenge the popular theory that the therapeutic benefits of ketamine are driven by its acute psychoactive or mystical-like effects. Instead, our findings suggest other possible reasons why ketamine prevents relapse, such as its ability to alter networks in the brain related to addiction or stimulate new neural connections to form. More research is needed to directly test these hypotheses.""

Alcohol use disorder remains a significant public health concern, with over 85,000 people in England receiving treatment annually – but many more still requiring treatment. While several effective treatments exist, there is a pressing need to diversify options and improve long-term outcomes.

Our research underscores that ketamine induces profound psychedelic effects in people with alcohol use disorder, but we still don't know the clinical reason why these experiences promote abstinence. Now we need to explore the roles of brain connection and function changes in ketamine's therapeutic action, as well as refining dosing to make it as effective as possible. We are now running a larger version of this study across the UK, currently recruiting people with alcohol problems, to try and provide those answers.""

Professor Celia Morgan from the University of Exeter and KARE study lead

The secondary analysis of the KARE clinical trial, conducted at two clinical research facilities in England and involving 96 adult participants, sought to clarify the role of ketamine's psychoactive effects in supporting abstinence from alcohol. The study is the largest to date examining the psychological mechanisms of ketamine in substance use disorder treatment, with a robust randomised, placebo-controlled design and a six-month follow-up period.

Participants receiving three weekly infusions of intravenous ketamine reported marked psychoactive experiences, including altered reality, out-of-body sensations, and perceptual distortions, compared to those receiving placebo. These effects were consistently strong across all three dosing sessions. This suggests little to no development of tolerance to ketamine's subjective effects over the short dosing schedule.

But despite the pronounced psychoactive effects, the study found no significant evidence that these experiences mediated ketamine's therapeutic benefit in reducing alcohol consumption. The percentage of days abstinent from alcohol over six months was not predicted by the intensity of subjective drug effects.

Professor Morgan is now leading a larger clinical trial called MORE-KARE, which is currently recruiting people with alcohol problems from across the UK, funded by the NHS with additional funding from Solvonis Therapeutics.

Bioengineered E. coli bacteria can now produce a group of compounds with anticancer, anti-HIV, antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory activities. The Kobe University achievement is the result of a rational design strategy that yields a platform for the industrial production of drug candidates.

Plants produce many substances with promising pharmacological activities. For example, Rhododendron species produce a class of compounds, called orsellinic acid-derived meroterpenoids, with remarkable anticancer, anti-HIV, antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory activities. However, despite their attractiveness for pharmacological research, their natural origin makes them unreliable and expensive to produce and previous attempts at the microbial production of the core compound, orsellinic acid, have only reached disappointingly low yields.

There are many examples where compounds appear promising in the literature but fail to advance sufficiently in evaluation or applied research due to supply issues. I began to feel this is less an issue with individual compounds and more a structural challenge facing natural products research as a whole.""

TOMITA Itsuki, doctoral student, Kobe University 

Tomita works in the group of Kobe University bioengineer HASUNUMA Tomohisa, a team of experts in rationally designing microorganisms, such as the gut bacterium Escherichia coli, for the production of a broad range of compounds. Using a combination of introducing appropriate genes from plants, fungi and bacteria, analyzing the organism's metabolism and optimizing the culture conditions, they set out to create the first production platform for these compounds ready for industrial-scale production based on the widely used bacterium E. coli.

In the journal Metabolic Engineering, the Kobe University bioengineers now publish that they achieved a production of 202 mg orsellinic acid per liter, which represents a 40-fold improvement over the previously reported microbial production. This was not only the highest production level achieved so far, it was also the first time the core compound was produced in E. coli. Tomita, who is the study's first author, says, ""It is a significant achievement that we recreated a complex eukaryotic biosynthetic pathway in the bacterium E. coli, something that was previously thought difficult.""

In addition, the group also introduced a further gene from Rhododendron that completed the biosynthesis of a pharmacologically relevant compound. As a representative for the class of pharmaceuticals, the Kobe University team chose grifolic acid, a compound known for its potent anticancer and analgesic properties. And while the so-engineered bacteria could successfully produce the target compound, the yield was low and Hasunuma's team acknowledges the need to further optimize the production process. In fact, they have already identified potential bottlenecks to be optimized in future studies.

But the group's aims go far beyond this. Hasunuma explains: ""In the short term, the platform established in this study can be immediately applied to the production and evaluation of related compounds and their derivatives. However, the rational design strategy employed here serves as a foundational technology for the production of various complex compounds using E. coli.""

This research was funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Program for Forming Japan's Peak Research Universities (J-PEAKS)) and the Japan Science and Technology Agency (grant JPMJGX23B4). It was conducted in collaboration with researchers from the University of Minho and the RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science.

The Latest | Feb 17, 2026

KANSAS CITY (Feb. 17, 2026) — Kansas City Current forward/midfielder Ally Sentnor has been named to the United States Women's National Team (USWNT) roster for the 2026 SheBelieves Cup presented by Visa, as announced by U.S. Soccer on Tuesday. Sentnor is part of the 26-player roster for one of the most prestigious four-team tournaments in women's soccer.

The 2026 SheBelieves Cup schedule will see the USA open the tournament against Argentina on Sunday, March 1, at 4 p.m. CT at GEODIS Park in Nashville, Tenn. The Stars and Stripes then play Canada on Wednesday, March 4, at 5:45 p.m. CT at ScottsMiracle-Gro Field in Columbus, Ohio – the site of the 2026 NWSL Challenge Cup between the KC Current and Gotham FC on June 26.

The tournament concludes at Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, N.J., on Saturday, March 7, with the U.S. taking on Colombia at 2:30 p.m. CT. All three matches will be broadcast on TBS, TNT and/or truTV, Telemundo and Universo and streamed on HBO Max and Peacock. The games will also be available on the radio in English on Westwood One and in Spanish on Futbol de Primera.

Sentnor's initial USWNT call-up was in November 2024, and she has been called into all but one senior camp since. She has six goals and three assists in 15 caps with seven starts entering the 2026 SheBelieves Cup.

Most recently, Sentnor had a two-goal performance in a 6-0 rout of Paraguay on Jan. 24 to open her 2026 scoring account. It was her second brace in a U.S. uniform, the first which came on June 3, 2025, in a friendly with Jamaica. Her first senior team cap was on Nov. 30, 2024, against England in front of over 78,000 fans at Wembley Stadium.

Sentnor's breakthrough was a year ago at the 2025 SheBelieves Cup where she finished the event with two goals and an assist. She scored in her first senior national team start on Feb. 20, 2025, against Colombia to become the first U.S. player to score her first USWNT goal in the SheBelieves Cup Tournament. A month before her 2025 SheBelieves Cup breakthrough, Sentnor was named the 2024 U.S. Soccer Young Female Player of the Year.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Bugg, Dahlien and Dickey Named to USWNT SheBelieves Cup Roster","https://www.reignfc.com/news/bugg-dahlien-and-dickey-named-tonbspuswnt-shebelieves-cup-roster","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 16:00:19 GMT","

As announced today, defender Jordyn Bugg, forward Maddie Dahlien and goalkeeper Claudia Dickey have been named the United States Women's National Team roster for the annual SheBelieves Cup by Head Coach Emma Hayes. The Reign trio make up three of the 19 NWSL players featured on the expanded 26-player roster – the second most of any NWSL team. 

During the 11th edition of the SheBelieves Cup, the U.S. is set to take on Argentina, Canada and Colombia. Bugg, Dahlien and Dickey, alongside the other 23 players called up, look to help the United States claim the SheBelieves cup title for the eighth time after their five-year win streak was snapped by Japan in 2025. 

The SheBelieves Cup marks the final competition for the United States Women's National Team before the squad is set to take on Japan three times in a friendly series this April, including a match in Seattle. 

20 players on the roster previously played in a FIFA Youth Women's World Cup for the USA prior to making their senior National Team debuts, emphasizing the importance of focusing on the development of youth players – an attribute Reign FC shares. 

These call-ups are a testament to the culture that continues to cultivate and develop talent, preparing players to be an integral part of Reign FC's new era. All three players most recently represented the USWNT in January camp, where Dahlien notably made her USWNT debut, while Bugg and Dickey brought their cap tallies up to six and seven, respectively. 

Bugg, steadfast in the backline, has consistently been named to USWNT rosters since she made her debut with the squad in summer 2025. Known for her maturity on the pitch and composure beyond her years, the 19-year-old is one of two teenagers named to the SheBelieves Cup roster. 

She continues to showcase her skill and soccer IQ for club and country. The 2025 season saw the defender appear in all but one regular-season match for the Reign. She was named a finalist for NWSL Defender of the Year and was also nominated for U.S. Soccer's Young Female Player of the Year for the second consecutive season. Bugg has cemented her place in Seattle since arriving in 2024 and shows no signs of slowing down. 

Another breakout talent for Seattle, Dahlien, has earned her second USWNT call-up. Headed into her second season with the Reign, the speedy attacker displayed her dizzying speed and fancy footwork in her caps against Paraguay and Chile, as the Stars and Stripes netted a combined 11 goals to earn back-to-back victories. 

A finalist for 2025 NWSL Rookie of the Year, Dahlien appeared in all 26 regular-season matches for the Reign during her first year as a professional. Versatile and hungry, she scored four goals and added four assists during the NWSL season. 

Rounding out Seattle selections, Dickey, who earned her first call-up to the USWNT in January 2025, is the most capped goalkeeper on the SheBelieves Cup roster. She has earned seven total caps for the squad, recording six clean sheets. 

The fifth-year goalkeeper has proved herself to be a consistent performer, dedicated to being the best at her craft. She appeared in every regular-season match for the Reign and finished the year with a league-leading 88 saves. 

All three players are entering unfamiliar territory as they are set to compete in the SheBelieves Cup for the very first time. As the 2026 NWSL season quickly approaches, this will be a good test for the players and an even better opportunity to continue to up their game and push Reign FC forward.

A strong roster for the first tournament of the year.

The United States Women's National Team are preparing for their first mini tournament of the year in SheBelieves Cup. Today, U.S. Soccer announced the 26-player roster that will compete in the tournament in early March against Argentina, Canada, and Colombia.

This is the first official international window of the year, which means that head coach Emma Hayes was able to call in players from Europe. She has done that, with a lot of the mainstay players in place for this camp. Eleven players on this roster were not on the roster for January Camp last month.

“The SheBelieves Cup is a fantastic tournament which gives us the opportunity to replicate the group stage of a FIFA tournament,” Emma Hayes said in a statement. “Three quality games in quick succession also allow us to replicate conditions that will prepare us for the World Cup qualifying campaign this fall. As always, we want to keep developing our player pool to be more and more prepared. As we gain more experience, I expect our standards to keep improving.”

For this year's SheBelieves Cup, there are a couple of new rules in place. Teams are able to call in 26-player rosters, with coaches selecting 23 of them for each matchday roster. There is also a new way to decide matches. Teams that win after 90 minutes will still get 3 points in the SheBelieves Cup standings, while losses give you 0 points. Matches that are level after 90 minutes will proceed directly to penalty kicks. Both teams will earn a point in the standings, and the winner of the penalty shootout will earn a second point.

The 26-player USWNT roster:

GOALKEEPERS (3): Claudia Dickey, Mandy McGlynn, Phallon Tullis-Joyce

DEFENDERS (9): Jordyn Bugg, Emily Fox, Naomi Girma, Lilly Reale, Tara Rudd, Emily Sonnett, Gisele Thompson, Kennedy Wesley, Kate Wiesner

MIDFIELDERS (8): Sam Coffey, Lindsey Heaps, Claire Hutton, Riley Jackson, Rose Lavelle, Olivia Moultrie, Jaedyn Shaw, Lily Yohannes

FORWARDS (6): Maddie Dahlien, Jameese Joseph, Trinity Rodman, Emma Sears, Ally Sentnor, Alyssa Thompson

The USWNT will open up SheBelieves Cup by playing Argentina on March 1st in Nashville. They follow that up with a March 4th match against Canada in Columbus, and will finish the tournament on March 7th in Harrison against Colombia.

European-based and Gotham FC players return to the fold after all-NWSL January camp

by

Emma Hayes named the 26-player roster that will attempt to reclaim the SheBelieves Cup for the United States next month. The 23 field players and 3 goalkeepers — all of whom are internationally capped — make up the 26-player tournament roster. Teams will be allowed to dress 23 of the 26 players for each match.

The United States will face Argentina on March 1 in Nashville, Canada on March 4 in Columbus, and Colombia on March 7 in Harrison, NJ. Last year's winner, Japan, is not competing at this year's SheBelieves.

“The SheBelieves Cup is a fantastic tournament which gives us the opportunity to replicate the group stage of a FIFA tournament,” Hayes said. “Three quality games in quick succession also allow us to replicate conditions that will prepare us for the World Cup qualifying campaign this fall. As always, we want to keep developing our player pool to be more and more prepared. As we gain more experience, I expect our standards to keep improving.”

New to the tournament this year is the 26-player, rotatable roster, and matches ending in draws proceeding to penalties. The new format means three points will be awarded for all matches. If a match goes to penalties, the winning side will earn two points, while the loser will earn one point.

Of the 26 players named Tuesday, 15 are carryovers from the all-NWSL January team that defeated Paraguay and Chile in the team's first two matches of 2026. Notable European-based names heading to SheBelieves include forward Alyssa Thompson, midfielder Lindsey Heaps (who is contracted to join Denver Summit this summer), defender Naomi Girma, and goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce. Sam Coffey will be in her first USWNT camp since transferring to English side Manchester City. There are also four Gotham players on the roster — Lilly Reale, Emily Sonnett Rose Lavelle and Jaedyn Shaw — who were not selected in January because Gotham was competing at the inaugural FIFA Women's Champions Cup.

The full USWNT roster for the 2026 SheBelieves Cup (with caps/goals) is:

GOALKEEPERS (3): Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign FC; 7), Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals; 5), Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United, ENG; 4)

The annual 2026 SheBelieves Cup will kick off on March 1, and U.S. women's national team head coach Emma Hayes has named a 26-player roster ahead of the tournament. The 11th annual SheBelieves Cup is a four-team invitational featuring the United States, Argentina, Canada, and Colombia. As Hayes narrows her player pool ahead of November's Concacaf W Championship -- the region's World Cup qualifiers -- the SheBelieves Cup marks the start of qualifying preparations for the looming 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup. 

A tournament blend of Concacaf and CONMEBOL opposition will test the Stars and Stripes with styles that they could see again during qualifiers. 

""The SheBelieves Cup is a fantastic tournament which gives us the opportunity to replicate the group stage of a FIFA tournament,"" said Hayes. ""Three quality games in quick succession also allow us to replicate conditions that will prepare us for the World Cup qualifying campaign this fall. As always, we want to keep developing our player pool to be more and more prepared. As we gain more experience, I expect our standards to keep improving.""

The SheBelieves Cup rosters were expanded to 26 players, up from 23 in previous editions, and this year's camps will allow coaches to name 23 players to dress for match dates. Gameday rosters can be rotated to feature any of the 26 selected players. Eleven players who were not in the January camps return to this roster, while 15 holdovers from the January roster earned a place on the SheBelieves Cup list.

While the January camps were held outside an official FIFA window, the SheBelieves Cup roster welcomes several European-based players back into the mix, including midfielder Sam Coffey, who recently transferred to Manchester City from the NWSL's Portland Thorns.

In perhaps a symbolic turning of the page, there are no players on the roster with zero appearances. This is the first time since the 2025 SheBelieves Cup that a USWNT roster has not featured an uncapped player. Hayes has given 32 players their first caps in 32 games as manager. No other full-time USWNT manager named more than 36 different starters in their first 30 games as head coach. 

Players listed by position (club, caps/goals)

Goalkeepers (3): Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign FC; 7), Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals; 5), Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United, ENG; 4)

Defenders (9): Jordyn Bugg (Seattle Reign FC; 6/0), Emily Fox (Arsenal FC, ENG; 71/1), Naomi Girma (Chelsea FC, ENG; 50/2), Lilly Reale (Gotham FC; 6/0), Tara Rudd (Washington Spirit; 10/0), Emily Sonnett (Gotham FC; 113/2), Gisele Thompson (Angel City FC; 5/0), Kennedy Wesley (San Diego Wave FC; 3/0), Kate Wiesner (Washington Spirit; 3/0)

Midfielders (8): Sam Coffey (Manchester City, ENG; 42/5), Lindsey Heaps (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 170/38), Claire Hutton (Bay FC; 13/1), Riley Jackson (North Carolina Courage; 1/0), Rose Lavelle (Gotham FC; 116/27), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC; 13/5), Jaedyn Shaw (Gotham FC; 31/9), Lily Yohannes (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 13/1)

Forwards (6): Maddie Dahlien (Seattle Reign FC; 2/0), Jameese Joseph (Chicago Stars FC; 2/1), Trinity Rodman (Washington Spirit; 49/13), Emma Sears (Racing Louisville FC; 14/6), Ally Sentnor (Kansas City Current; 15/6), Alyssa Thompson (Chelsea FC, ENG; 26/3)

National team veterans Sophia Wilson and Catarina Macario did not make the cut for the SheBelieves Cup roster for varying fitness reasons, with Hayes admitting on Tuesday that the pair would likely have been part of the group if they were fit enough to take part.

Wilson has not been with the national team since 2024 and spent all of 2025 on maternity leave, though she has returned to training with the Portland Thorns and expects to be fit for the start of the NWSL season in mid-March. Though Hayes and Wilson both wanted the player to take part in March's USWNT matches, the Thorns ultimately decided Wilson was not fit enough for the opportunity this time around.

""Soph and I spoke and she's just not ready,"" Hayes said. ""The return to play protocol has just not given her enough time, I think, for her to be in the place she wanted to be in so it's right that she's not in the squad, however much I want her to be. The reality is Portland didn't her deem her to be.""

As for Macario, Hayes disclosed that the player is dealing with a heel injury. She did not comment on Macario's club situation, which has been the source of some speculation in recent weeks -- she has not played for Chelsea since December 10 and has since been left off the team's UEFA Women's Champions League roster, all while being linked to a move to the NWSL's San Diego Wave.

""My understanding is that she has a heel injury. She's getting closer and closer every day,"" Hayes said before adding that Macario's exact timeline to return to the pitch is unclear. ""I don't know when that's going to be but she's not available for selection.""

Other players like defender Avery Patterson and midfielder Croix Bethune, the latter of whom was part of a blockbuster trade to the Kansas City Current last week, were also left off because they do not have enough reps under their belts during preseason. Their absences, though, afforded opportunities to another batch of rising USWNT stars -- midfielder Riley Tiernan and forward Maddie Dahlien, who earned their first caps last month, will now join a more experienced version of the U.S. team for a SheBelieves Cup that simulates a tournament setting. Forward Jameese Joseph also got the nod in large part because Wilson and Macario were unavailable.

""If Cat Macario and Sophia Wilson were available for selection, they would've been selected as the [No.] 9s,"" Hayes said before reinforcing her longstanding project to expand the player pool. ""We have to develop more nines and [Joseph] said, 'That's where I want to be.'""

U.S. men's national team striker Haji Wright scored a hat-trick in Coventry City's 3–1 win over Middlesbrough, becoming just the fourth player in Championship history to score a trio of goals against the leaders of the division.

The Sky Blues trailed Boro by two points heading into Monday's contest, but after Wright's devastating performance in front of goal it's Frank Lampard's side that are now in pole position to return to the Premier League for the first time since 2000–01. 

Wright, 27, had been kept quiet for the most part since the start of 2026, but Monday's hat-trick saw him up his goal tally on the year to five and get within one goal of Swansea's Žan Vipotnik in the Championship's Golden Boot race, upping his account to 13 goals. 

In a game that could have a decisive impact on the title race, Wright proved his quality and emphatically decided the clash.

Wright's performance began with him hitting the post with his first header of the night, dominantly winning the ball in the air in a sign of what was to come. He then showcased his strength and physicality, using his imposing frame to shield the ball and tuck home a first-time weak-foot finish into the corner.

His physicality saw him gain the upper hand in most aerial duels and his ability to read the play led directly to Coventry's second. Wright took advantage of a split-second defensive lapse, getting across his marker to rifle a vicious strike into the bottom corner of Sol Brynn's goal.

A goal from USMNT midfielder Riley McGree got Boro back into the game, but Wright kept his cool from the penalty spot after Matt Targett had been penalised for handball to bury his effort from 12 yards into the side netting.

“In games like this, it's so important to be clinical in the right moments,” Lampard said, praising Wright's performance following the match. 

Folarin Balogun appears to have the upper hand in the battle to be the USMNT's starting striker in the 2026 World Cup, but Wright could likely be the next in line—his case strengthened by the fact Ricardo Pepi's fractured forearm has kept him sidelined since early January. 

This weekend, fellow Championship striker Patrick Agyemang scored his 10th goal of the season for Derby County. Not to be outshined, Wright's hat-trick performance on Monday served as a resounding response in the battle for a striker spot in the USMNT roster. 

A sensational start of the season from Wright was crowned by the brace he scored against Australia during an October international friendly, yet he then went 15 appearances for club and country without a goal.

Five goals in his last three appearances has helped Wright to rediscover his mojo, and it's impossible to imagine that Pochettino won't have been impressed by what he saw.

Haji Wright put his best foot forward in letting U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino that he wants to be a part of the World Cup team.

The former New York Cosmos striker, who had been in a personal drought for several months, converted his third hat-trick for host Coventry City, which recorded a 3-1 win over Middlesbrough to regain first place int the English Championship.

Coventry, which is keen to earn automatic promotion to the Premier League, improved to 18-6-8 and 62 points, one point better than Middlesbrough (18-7-7, 61).

“When you're a striker, you want to score goals,” Wright told Paramount+. “I was hoping to get back into form, and tonight was a great opportunity for that

“It was a great night to come out and show what we can do.”

Wright, who has 13 goals, two behind the league leader, scored from six yards in the 21st minute, volleyed home a shot in the 55th minute and converted a penalty kick in the 71st minute.

Landon Donovan and Tim Howard expound on the possibility of Christian Pulisic returning to the English Premier League.

With American soccer star Christian Pulisic still awaiting a long-term contract offer from his current club, AC Milan, speculation over a possible return to the English Premier League – widely considered the world's top domestic league – has started to build.  Pulisic's current deal runs through the end of the 2026-2027 season with a team option for '27-'28.  And while Pulisic could remain on that current deal, Milan would risk losing him for an undervalued fee should he push for a move.

Earlier in his career, Pulisic spent 4 seasons with Premier League giants, Chelsea FC, to some mixed results.  While playing an important role in their run to winning the 2021 UEFA Champions League, he also failed to start more than 20 Premier League games in any individual season going progressively downward from 19 his first year to just 8 in his final year.

On the latest episode of Unfiltered Soccer hosted by Tim Howard and Landon Donovan, the two U.S. legends discussed whether a move back to England would be wise for the Hershey-born attacker.



“I remember Kevin De Bruyne at Chelsea. I remember Mo Salah at Chelsea,” said Howard in comparing Pulisic to two players that similarly came to the Premier League early in their careers, struggled, left and eventually returned, becoming two of the greatest players the league has ever seen.

“I sort of feel like that with Christian Pulisic as well,” continued Howard.  “I backed him to the hills at Chelsea. Unfortunately, he didn't get the rub of the green, went through some different coaches, and then he went off. But he sort of reminds me of Mo Salah and Kevin De Bruyne in that he now went off; he's matured, and he's older, and he's now gone and carried a league. He's carried one of the best teams in the league, right? He's put AC Milan on his back.”

For Donovan, questions about Pulisic making the leap from Italy's Serie A to the English Premier League have nothing to do with talent but rather durability.

“This is a scenario where I think if he is motivated and wants to go prove it, he is capable of it – going to one of these big clubs in England.  And he is capable of doing it.  The one hesitation I have... and this is just speaking from personal experience... the physical part of it is a real thing, man.”

This season, Pulisic appeared to be in the best form of his career before a low-grade hamstring tear in October, and bout of hip bursitis in January-February caused him to miss several matches.

“He's a phenomenal athlete, he is,” said Donovan.  “But some of the athletes in the Premier League are monsters. I mean monsters. And to do it, thirty-five, forty, forty-five times a year at that pace is really hard.

“I don't know, physically, if he could do it every single week for two or three years, like some of these guys. Because it's really hard, man. It is really hard.”

Club's 52,000-square-foot facility in East Charlotte to serve as team training site for Scottish FA during world's marquee sporting event

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (Tuesday, February 17, 2026) – Charlotte FC today announced the Scotland National Team selected the Club's training facility as Team Base Camp training site for FIFA World Cup 2026™.

The 52,000-square-foot facility provides a state-of-the-art setting for the Scottish FA's official training site and team headquarters as they prepare for Group C matches against Haiti, Morocco and Brazil.

“We're excited to welcome Scotland, one of the world's most historic footballing associations, to Charlotte for the FIFA World Cup,” said Tepper Sports & Entertainment CEO Kristi Coleman. “This summer brings the biggest sporting event North America has seen this century, and we're honored for Charlotte FC to be named a team base camp for a major European nation. Scotland joins a prestigious group of national teams and elite foreign clubs that have utilized Charlotte FC as a training base, and the team's arrival strengthens our facility's growing reputation as one of the nation's premier club headquarters. We look forward to collaborating with the Scottish FA and FIFA to deliver a world-class experience for their staff, players and fans in our vibrant city.”

The facility, located in East Charlotte, opened in 2023 and features access to eight soccer fields for sporting and community use. The building houses all teams under the Charlotte FC umbrella including the First Team, the Club's second team, Crown Legacy FC, and all academy age groups.

“It is our honor to host the Scotland National Team at our home for this summer's FIFA World Cup, and we're proud that our facility reflects the high standards of a nation competing on the world's biggest stage,” said Charlotte FC General Manager Zoran Krneta. “At Charlotte FC, we have built a high-performance training center that supports the day-to-day demands required for elite competition. Our facility ensures Scotland has every advantage as they set their sights on the world's biggest prize and we wish them all the success at the FIFA World Cup.”

The facility features locker rooms for all teams, a cafeteria designed for player nutrition, and a 2,800-square-foot weight room. It is also home to the Club's business staff.

“We are delighted to confirm Charlotte as our training base. We looked at the FIFA-nominated options, against our own predetermined criteria, and Charlotte FC have a top MLS training facility with everything we need to prepare for our matches,” said Scotland National Team Head Coach Steve Clarke. “I'd like to add that Charlotte FC's staff could not have been more welcoming. As most competing nations have discovered, travel will be an important factor in this World Cup. Our base in Charlotte will be convenient for the airport, with flights around two hours to Boston and Miami for our group stage matches. We are hopeful that this will give us the best possible conditions to get ready for the tournament and it's another exciting landmark ahead of the summer.”

Scotland returns to the FIFA World Cup™ for the first time since 1998 after finishing top of their group in UEFA qualifying outlasting Denmark in dramatic fashion on the final day of matches. The Scots are led by captain Andy Robertson (Liverpool), Serie A MVP award winner Scott McTominay (Napoli), and former Charlotte FC Head Coach Dean Smith disciple John McGinn (Aston Villa).

Beyond McGinn, the Scottish connections to Charlotte FC flow to Technical Director Tommy Wilson who began his career as the Football Development Officer for the Scottish FA. Additionally, John Currie, the Club's Director of High Performance, spent over a decade in Scottish football with Celtic FC and Heart of Midlothian FC.

This will mark the second consecutive summer that Charlotte FC's facilities will be utilized by a team competing in a globalized FIFA competition. The Club's stadium hosted four FIFA Club World Cup 2025™ matches, delivering the second-highest attended group stage game of the tournament with 70,248 fans in Uptown to see Real Madrid vs Pachuca.

Charlotte will not host any matches for this summer's FIFA World Cup™ but will be the site where the United States Men's National Team play its penultimate friendly ahead of the tournament. The match against African champions Senegal will take place on Sunday, May 31.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Scotland's national soccer team will use Charlotte FC's training facility as its base camp for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the club announced Tuesday.

The Scottish FA selected the 52,000-square-foot facility in east Charlotte as its official training site and team headquarters as Scotland prepares for Group C matches against Haiti, Morocco, and Brazil.

""Charlotte FC have a top MLS training facility with everything we need to prepare for our matches,"" Scotland Head Coach Steve Clarke said. ""Our base in Charlotte will be convenient for the airport, with flights around two hours to Boston and Miami for our group stage matches.""

Scotland returns to the World Cup for the first time since 1998 after finishing atop their UEFA qualifying group. The squad is led by captain Andy Robertson of Liverpool, Serie A MVP Scott McTominay of Napoli, and Aston Villa midfielder John McGinn, who played under former Charlotte FC head coach Dean Smith.

The Scottish connections to Charlotte FC run deeper than the field. Club Technical Director Tommy Wilson began his career as the Football Development Officer for the Scottish FA, and Director of High Performance John Currie spent more than a decade in Scottish football with Celtic FC and Heart of Midlothian FC.

""We are delighted to confirm Charlotte as our training base,"" Clarke said. ""Charlotte FC's staff could not have been more welcoming. We are hopeful that this will give us the best possible conditions to get ready for the tournament.""

Tepper Sports & Entertainment CEO Kristi Coleman called the announcement a significant moment for the city heading into the summer.

""This summer brings the biggest sporting event North America has seen this century, and we're honored for Charlotte FC to be named a team base camp for a major European nation,"" Coleman said.

The announcement marks the second consecutive summer Charlotte FC's facilities have been used for a major FIFA event. The club's stadium hosted four matches during the FIFA Club World Cup 2025, including the second-highest attended group stage game of the tournament when 70,248 fans packed Bank of America Stadium to watch Real Madrid face Pachuca.

Charlotte will not host any World Cup matches this summer, but the city will serve as the site of the United States Men's National Team's penultimate tune-up before the tournament. The USMNT will face African champions Senegal on May 31.

The Champions League trophy on display at holders Paris Saint-Germain's Parc des Princes stadium last August Franck Fife/Getty Images

The holders and the record winners — Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid — will compete in the Champions League's knockout play-offs this month.

Twelve of the 36 teams were eliminated in January following the wild final round of the league phase, so things are starting to shape up. Last month's draw means we can forecast the possible matchups in the round of 16, which starts in March.

As the league phase's top eight sit with their feet up, the 16 teams who finished ninth to 24th will compete over two legs this midweek and next to decide who joins them in the Champions League's last 16.

And there are plenty of potential narratives unfolding. Could Jose Mourinho torment former employers Real Madrid again? Will Bodo/Glimt cause another upset? Can Monaco overcome Ligue 1 rivals and defending champions PSG? We take a look at what's coming up, and what it all might mean.

Last season, the Champions League introduced a revamped format. Instead of four-team groups competing against each other home and away, 36 teams were all together in one league table. Teams play eight matches, all against different teams, to determine their final position.

Following the league phase, which concludes with 18 games kicking off simultaneously on one January night, the top eight sides in the standings automatically qualify for the round of 16. The bottom 12 are eliminated, leaving the teams who finished from ninth to 24th. They must compete in the play-off round, eight ties contested over two legs, for the right to face a top-eight opponent in the last 16 in March.

The first legs are on February 17 and 18 — four today (Tuesday), four Wednesday — with the second legs on the reverse days a week later.

Real Madrid have won the Champions League 15 times but failed to finish in this season's top eight after a dramatic 4-2 defeat against Benfica in their final league-phase game. Goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin scored a last-gasp winner, sending former Madrid manager Mourinho flying down the touchline in celebration. The twist? Madrid have a chance to redeem themselves after subsequently being drawn against… Benfica in the play-offs.

For the second season in a row, PSG face a fellow Ligue 1 club in the play-offs. Last year, they cruised past Brest 10-0 on aggregate and went on to win the competition. Will history repeat itself?



Hoping to cause further upsets, Bodo/Glimt beat Manchester City and Atletico Madrid to end the league phase in 23rd place. The Norwegians' prize is a tie against Inter, last year's beaten finalists.

Newcastle United, who face Qarabag of Azerbaijan, and Juventus, up against Turkey's Galatasaray, are among the other teams competing in the play-off round. The clubs who finished ninth to 16th were seeded in the draw, so will get to play their tie's second legs at home.

The top eight are ‘paired', which means the sides finishing first and second will be placed on separate sides of the draw. We will know which side of the bracket these pairs fall on after the next knockout-stage draw (more on that below), but this is a look at the possible round-of-16 matchups.



Beyond that, the picture is less clear until the draw, but there could be all-Premier League quarter-finals between Manchester City and Arsenal, and Liverpool or Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea. Spain's big two Real Madrid and Barcelona cannot meet until at least the semi-finals, and last year's finalists — PSG and Inter — are on different sides of the bracket again.

Just as the sides who came ninth to 16th in the league phase are seeded in the play-offs, the top eight will have the advantage of a second leg at home in the round of 16.

The teams who finished first to fourth in the league phase are also seeded for the quarter-finals, giving them home advantage in those second legs if they progress. Then, the top two in the league phase, Arsenal and Bayern Munich, are seeded through to the semi-finals — all of their second legs will take place at home.

If an unseeded club beat a seeded one, they inherit their seeding position.

The draw for the remaining three knockout rounds is next Friday, February 27, a couple of days after the play-offs conclude. It will determine which side of the bracket the top eight pairings are on and set the tournament for the months ahead, leading to the final in Hungarian capital Budapest's Puskas Arena on Saturday, May 30.

Our projections, powered by Opta stats, rank Newcastle as the most likely play-off team to progress to the next round. According to Opta, they have a 90 per cent chance of overcoming Qarabag, despite some shaky Premier League form where they have won just once in five matches, losing three and drawing with last-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers.

PSG (86 per cent) and Inter (79 per cent), who met in last year's final, are also expected to reach the last 16.

The tightest of the eight ties is predicted to be between Borussia Dortmund, second in the Bundesliga, and Atalanta, sixth in Serie A, with our projections giving the German side a 56 per cent chance of going through. And Madrid (60 per cent) are not particularly strong favourites against Benfica three weeks on from that jaw-dropping defeat in Lisbon, when a win would have secured the Spanish side a top-eight finish.

...

The disciplinary fallout from the Derby d'Italia has been swift and severe, with the Italian sporting judge handing down heavy sanctions following the chaotic scenes at San Siro. The harshest punishment has been reserved for Juventus CEO Comolli, who has been banned from all football activities until March 31, 2026. The severity of the ban reflects the gravity of the incident detailed in the official match report, which describes an executive who completely lost his composure in the heat of the moment.

The report paints a disturbing picture of the interval, stating that Comolli displayed an ""aggressive and seriously intimidating attitude"" towards referee La Penna. The situation escalated rapidly in the tunnel, where the CEO reportedly attempted to make physical contact with the official. He was only prevented from doing so by the physical intervention of the Juventus coaching staff and other club employees, who had to restrain him. Furthermore, Comolli was cited for using ""gravely insulting"" language, a tirade that reportedly continued even outside the officials' dressing room long after the teams had separated.

The official findings suggest that the half-time interval teetered on the brink of a physical brawl. The image of a high-ranking club executive having to be held back by his own technical team has resulted in a €15,000 fine to accompany Comolli's lengthy suspension. However, he was not the only Juventus director to let his frustrations boil over.

Chiellini, a man who spent decades battling in these high-stakes fixtures as a player, also found himself in the crosshairs of the sporting judge. The legendary former defender turned director will be sidelined from official duties until February 27, 2026. While his conduct was deemed less physically threatening than Comolli's, the report noted that Chiellini contested the referee's performance in a ""disrespectful manner."" He was also cited for directing ""offensive criticisms"" at the assistant referees as the tunnel melee unfolded, adding to the sense of total breakdown in relations between the club and the officials.

The root cause of this administrative explosion was the dismissal of Kalulu for a second yellow card - a decision Juventus firmly believe was manufactured by a clear simulation from the opposition. With replays appearing to show minimal contact, the sense of injustice within the Bianconeri camp has morphed into a direct attack on the governance of Italian referees. Chiellini did not mince words in the aftermath, turning his fire on referee designator Gianluca Rocchi and demanding systemic change.

""We cannot talk about football after what happened today. Something truly unacceptable happened today, no matter whether it happens to us or someone else,"" Chiellini raged, clearly feeling that the standard of officiating has reached a crisis point. ""Starting tomorrow it seems VAR must change, because it is unacceptable that so many errors continue to happen even in big matches like this.""

Comolli went even further, framing the incident not just as a loss for Juventus, but as a black eye for the entire Serie A brand. With the Derby d'Italia being one of the most-watched fixtures in global football, the CEO expressed deep embarrassment at the spectacle presented to the international audience.

""Clearly, as a club we feel today is very embarrassing. It's a disgrace what happened today, and we feel strongly as a club from the ownership, fans, players, to the coach, this must not happen again,"" Comolli remarked. He lamented the repetitive nature of these controversies, adding: ""It happens again and again... tonight is a summary of what we have seen this season. For a match like this, with the whole world watching."" To compound the misery for the Old Lady, the sporting judge confirmed Kalulu will serve a one-match suspension, leaving Juve shorthanded as they look to recover from this blow in their pursuit of the Scudetto.","{'href': 'https://uk.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports UK'}","soccer"

 NFF lodged a complaint with FIFA challenging the eligibility status of certain DR Congo players

The Nigeria Football Federation, NFF, has dismissed rumours regarding a decision from FIFA concerning Nigeria's protest against the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) over allegations of fielding ineligible players.

The controversy arose after Nigeria's Super Eagles were eliminated by DR Congo in a penalty shootout during the World Cup play-offs for the African zone last November, ending their chances of qualifying for the intercontinental play-offs later this year.

In response, the NFF lodged a formal complaint with FIFA, challenging the eligibility status of certain players from the DR Congo squad.

The NFF's stance is based on Congolese laws that do not recognize dual nationality, suggesting that some players representing the Leopards may have held European passports.

However, the NFF has now confirmed that FIFA has not rendered any judgment on the issue.

Ademola Olajire, NFF's Director of Communications, labeled reports indicating a ruling favouring either Nigeria or DR Congo as “false.”

“There is no decision from FIFA at this time. Any claims that a ruling has been made are false. FIFA has not communicated any verdict to the NFF or the Congolese federation,” Olajire said via 234Sports.

Nigeria are set to miss out on a second successive edition of the Fifa World Cup

There is a mix of hope and frustration as Nigeria supporters await Fifa's decision on allegations that DR Congo fielded ineligible players during Africa's 2026 World Cup play-offs.

The Congolese beat the Super Eagles on penalties in November to book their place in an intercontinental qualifier for the finals in Canada, Mexico and the United States.

The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) submitted a complaint to Fifa in December, arguing that Leopards players such as Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Axel Tuanzebe - both former England youth internationals - were ineligible because Congolese law does not allow dual citizenship.

While a section of the Super Eagles fanbase is hoping the side could secure a lifeline, others are questioning the fairness of a potential qualification by appeal.

Fifa has confirmed the matter is under review but the world governing body has not issued a timetable for a ruling and the NFF has moved to quash speculation that its complaint has been thrown out.

""Any claims that a ruling has been made are false,"" NFF director of communications Demola Olajire said.

""Fifa has not communicated any verdict to us or to the Congolese federation.""

At the time of the protest, NFF general secretary Mohammed Sanusi argued DR Congo had breached Fifa's regulations.

Tuanzebe and Wan-Bissaka also subsequently featured for the Leopards at the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Morocco.

""The Congolese rule (law) says you cannot have dual nationality but some of their players have European and French passports,"" Sanusi stated.

""Our contention is that Fifa was deceived into clearing them.""

The Congolese Football Federation rejected the NFF's challenge, branding the petition as an attempt to ""win via the back door"".

The Leopards will face either New Caledonia or Jamaica in March's intercontinental play-off, with the winner progressing to the expanded 48-team World Cup and joining Group K alongside Portugal, Uzbekistan and Colombia.

The ex-Peterborough man helping World Cup dreams come true

West Ham right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka made his DR Congo debut in September last year after switching his international allegiance from England

This is not the first time African qualification campaigns have spilled into courtrooms and committee rooms. 

Such episodes often expose the tension between Fifa's statutes, which prioritise sporting nationality as recognised by the governing body, and national laws which may impose stricter definitions of citizenship. 

Past rulings suggest that Fifa tends to lean on its own regulations but each case rests on its own specific facts and documentation.

Fifa statutes set out the conditions under which a player may change the national association they represent.

Under these rules, a player may ask to change the association they represent only once and the process requires a written and substantiated request which must be approved by Fifa's players' status committee. 

While Fifa requires a player to hold a passport for the new nation they wish to represent, it is possible for them to also hold another passport.

That discrepancy between domestic laws and Fifa's eligibility framework may have fuelled the legal ambiguity upon which Nigeria's hopes hinge.

The NFF argues that some Congolese players held European passports, a point not directly accounted for in Fifa's eligibility checks, and contends that if those domestic laws were breached then the players should not have been cleared to participate. 

The petition also suggested that Fifa may have been provided with incomplete or misleading documentation when eligibility approvals were sought for the players, a claim which, if upheld, could raise wider governance concerns.

With a decision expected from Fifa, a ruling in Nigeria's favour could prompt closer scrutiny of player documentation for other African nations, with federations keen to avoid similar challenges.

When a formal protest reaches Fifa, there are several possible outcomes:

Dismissal: Fifa may find the NFF's evidence insufficient and close the case, leaving DR Congo's progress in World Cup qualification intact.

Investigation and administrative sanction: Fifa could investigate and, if it finds breaches in the clearance process, sanction the federation (eg fines, warnings) but leave results unchanged.

Sporting sanctions: In the most serious cases, Fifa or the Confederation of African Football could order a forfeit or award the match to the other side, or deduct points in group-stage contexts. Historically, such sporting sanctions are applied when administrative or player registration rules are clearly and materially breached, such as with falsification or deliberate misrepresentation.

For Nigeria, the stakes are clear.

The Super Eagles may have won bronze at the 2025 Afcon, reasserting themselves among the continent's elite, but the stark reality is the side, as it stands, is set to miss out on a second successive edition of the World Cup.

DR Congo, meanwhile, have taken more than half a century to get close to returning to football's biggest stage after becoming Africa's first sub-Saharan nation to reach the tournament in 1974 (when the country was called Zaire).

The possibility that an administrative ruling could undo success achieved on the field is something that may unsettle many neutral observers.

File photo: Super Eagles players

Kindly share this story:

Nigerians continue to await the verdict of world football governing body, FIFA, over a petition submitted by the Nigeria Football Federation, alleging that DR Congo fielded ineligible players during last November's 2025 World Cup African play-offs.
FIFA's decision, earlier reported to be announced after the body's meeting on Monday, has yet to be released and is now expected on Tuesday (today).
African football fans, especially Nigerians, continue to await the ruling, given that the outcome could potentially reinstate the Super Eagles into the intercontinental play-offs in Mexico later this month, where one of the last World Cup tickets is on offer.
PUNCH Online outlines key things to know about the case.  




The match in question
In November 2025, Nigeria's Super Eagles lost to DR Congo 4–3 on penalties in the African play-off final for 2026 World Cup qualification, ending their chances of qualifying for the tournament.
Nigeria's protest
The NFF filed a formal complaint with FIFA in December 2025, alleging that DR Congo fielded ineligible players who recently switched nationalities.
Key players accused
Nigeria claims several DR Congo players, including Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Axel Tuanzebe, hold dual nationalities, potentially violating eligibility rules.        
DR Congo's nationality law
The core argument hinges on DR Congo's constitution, which reportedly prohibits dual citizenship. Nigeria argues that DR Congo's fielding of players with dual citizenship conflicts with FIFA's player eligibility and nationality-switch procedures.  Related News  77% of CAS cases in 2025 were football-related, FIFA report shows  FULL LIST: Fixture of CAF Champions League quarter-finals, semi-finals  'Napoli treated me like a dog' before Galatasaray move — Osimhen   
What Nigeria wants
The NFF is pushing for DR Congo's disqualification from the play-off result, which could lead to a forfeited match and/or a 3–0 award to Nigeria. Other sanctions may also be imposed on the Central African nation.
Possible outcomes if the petition is upheld
If FIFA finds violations, options include match forfeiture, points adjustments, fines, or disqualification, though such measures are rare in knockout play-offs without clear evidence of fraud.
Possible outcomes if the petition is rejected
DR Congo's result would stand, confirming their advancement, and Nigeria's 2026 World Cup hopes would end without further recourse.
Historical precedents
Past FIFA rulings on ineligibility show that the body can overturn results or impose penalties, though each case depends on its context.
No verdict yet
As of Tuesday, FIFA has not issued any official ruling.
Fake news
Unconfirmed reports circulating on Monday claimed that FIFA ruled in Nigeria's favour. 
   
However, NFF Director of Communications Ademola Olajire stated, “There is no decision from FIFA at this time. Any claims that a ruling has been made are false.”
Alternative outcome if the petition is upheld
Even if DR Congo is awarded a 3–0 loss, a favourable ruling for Nigeria might not guarantee automatic qualification. It could lead to replays or other adjustments, and other nations, such as Cameroon, have been speculated as potential beneficiaries.

""I have a really incredible team that buys for us, and I know that they have been planning for this for quite some time. We already knew that this was going to be a huge, huge thing,"" said Jess Knust, store manager.

""I have a really incredible team that buys for us, and I know that they have been planning for this for quite some time. We already knew that this was going to be a huge, huge thing,"" said Jess Knust, store manager.

The FIFA Men's World Cup is 114 days away, and soccer stores across the Kansas City Metro are stocking gear to be ready for the roaring rush of soccer fans. 

One of those places is Soccer Master, a Missouri-based retailer tucked away on 135th Street in Overland Park, Kansas.  

You could say the store is getting pumped for this kick of fandom expected this summer that'll reach well beyond their normal KC customer base.

""Everyone's so excited,"" Jess Knust, store manager, said. 

She said she might need to add two or three more full-time employees to her roster of six if the store needs more help with orders. 

""Everyone is trying to decide if they're going to games, if they're couch surfing and watching, or going to the parties that are going to be happening,"" Knust said. 

As for the soccer merch, for the last two months, Soccer Master has been accumulating over 150 World Cup-related pieces.

 ""I have a really incredible team that buys for us, and I know that they have been planning for this for quite some time. We already knew that this was going to be a huge, huge thing,"" Knust said. 

She said it takes her five business days from placing a shipment order to delivery in her store. Knust will be turning one large corner of the space into a ""World Cup hub"" with hats, balls, jerseys and signs. 

""So we're working on getting all the different federations here into store, and if I'm not going to carry it in store, I will be able to get it,"" Knust said. 

She tells KMBC 9 that Adidas and Puma home kits are easy to come by right now. In-store, she has home jerseys from Argentina, Spain, Mexico, Germany, Belgium, Colombia, Italy, Portugal, Austria and Algeria. Knust tells KMBC 9 she can also customize any of these jerseys. 

""Coming is (the) United States, the Netherlands, England, Croatia, Brazil. I'm missing so many cause we're getting so many,"" Knust said.

Away kits are expected sometime in April or May. She's already sold at least 100 Argentina jerseys, if not more, and expects USA merch to be the highest in demand. Knust tells KMBC 9 the USA gear will show up in March or April. 

""This is from the '94 World Cup, which is really kind of cool. That was the last time it was here in the United States,"" Knust said. 

She is also selling a whole set of mini World Cup balls. Each one comes with a stand and the oldest ball is from 1970 — the Telestar ball.

Jorge Jesus admits that Al-Hilal have “more economic power” than Al-Nassr, having seen Cristiano Ronaldo go on strike amid questions of how wealth is distributed among clubs controlled by the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF). The agitated Portuguese GOAT is playing again, with his manager in Riyadh appreciating why frustration has boiled over.

Five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo stunned the sporting world when ruling himself out of selection contention in the Middle East. Having grown disillusioned with how rival clubs are able to spend more than Al-Nassr - with Karim Benzema's switch between Al-Ittihad and Al-Hilal proving to be the final straw - CR7 sat out three matches.

He returned in a 2-0 win over Al-Fateh, as he continues to chase down 1,000 career goals, with a professional protest being brought to a close. Fellow countryman Jesus is delighted to have the evergreen 41-year-old back at his disposal and can, due to personal experience, understand where Ronaldo's arguments are coming from.

Jesus has said: “I've already been at Al Hilal. I've been on the other side, so I know what that's like. I've already benefited from it. They have more economic power. When I was there, I benefited as a coach. It's normal. Al-Nassr, with different resources, has to compete for the top spots. We have to continue to be strong.

“That's why I was hired, to reduce the gap between Al Hilal and Al Nassr, in terms of titles and points. And that's what we're doing. We have a lot of confidence in Al Nassr's structure, a structure that, little by little, is increasingly managing to balance the group. But not only the group of players who play, but also a group off the field, a team that is aware of the difficulties, a team that knows it will be fighting against opponents with greater economic power, not sporting power.”

The Saudi Pro League has refuted Ronaldo's claims that Al-Nassr's rivals receive preferential treatment, saying in an official statement: “The Saudi Pro League is structured around a simple principle: every club operates independently under the same rules.

“Clubs have their own boards, their own executives and their own football leadership. Decisions on recruitment, spending and strategy sit with those clubs, within a financial framework designed to ensure sustainability and competitive balance. That framework applies equally across the league.

“Cristiano has been fully engaged with Al Nassr since his arrival and has played an important role in the club's growth and ambition. Like any elite competitor, he wants to win. But no individual - however significant - determines decisions beyond their own club.”

Ronaldo has been advised that he needs to “respect the league or leave”, with questions being asked of how a man working on the most lucrative contract in world football can justify refusing to do his day job.

The former Manchester United and Real Madrid superstar has, however, always demanded the highest of standards from himself and those around him. He does not take kindly to coming second and is still waiting on a first major honour of his spell in the Middle East - having won the Arab Club Champions Cup in 2023.

Jesus believes he can deliver on Ronaldo's ambition. He has said of chasing down prestigious prizes: “We are in the championship fight, we are one point behind the leaders, something Al-Nassr hasn't been able to do. In recent years, Al-Nassr has finished 16 or 14 points behind the lead. This year we don't want that to happen, I don't know what will happen. We are confident that we can compete for the top spots until the end.”

Al-Nassr will be in AFC Cup action against Arkadag on Wednesday, before Ronaldo and Co return to Saudi Pro League competition on Saturday at home to Al-Hazem. CR7 will hope to be on target in that contest as he chases down a third consecutive Golden Boot.

Questions are, however, being asked of his long-term future. Ronaldo is heading towards another World Cup with Portugal, as captain of his country, but has release clauses in his contract that can be triggered in the next transfer window. A return to Europe has been speculated on, alongside a move that could see him join eternal rival Lionel Messi in MLS.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

With just weeks until Mexico face Portugal in a high-profile friendly, Portuguese media report growing concern over renovation delays at Mexico City's iconic Estadio Azteca, now renamed Estadio Banorte. While organizers insist the venue will be ready for March 28, uncertainty has sparked speculation about a potential change of site for the match - and even future World Cup fixtures.

Concern is mounting in Portugal over the status of Mexico City's historic Estadio Azteca, recently rebranded as Estadio Banorte, as renovation work continues less than two months before a scheduled friendly against Mexico.


According to Portuguese outlet A Bola, members of the Portuguese national team's coaching staff and federation officials are uneasy about whether the stadium will meet required safety and logistical standards in time for the March 28 match. The report suggests delays could, in a worst-case scenario, prompt FIFA to reconsider not only the friendly but potentially other World Cup-related fixtures if key construction phases are not completed on schedule.


The match is expected to draw global attention, particularly with the possibility of Cristiano Ronaldo featuring in what would be his first appearance in Mexico.


Amid the speculation, Emilio Azcárraga acknowledged setbacks in the remodeling process but attempted to calm fears about the March fixture. “There are many things that, due to the complexity of the project, cannot be completed now. That's why they will be finished after the World Cup,” he admitted, while assuring that the first phase of renovations would be ready before Portugal's visit.

So far, neither FIFA nor stadium officials have announced any changes to the venue. The Mexico vs. Portugal friendly remains on the calendar, as does the 2026 World Cup opener scheduled for the same stadium.

Alternative venues have entered the conversation. Options such as Estadio Akron, Estadio BBVA, and Estadio Olímpico Universitario have been mentioned as potential backups should construction deadlines not be met.

With ticket demand already soaring and international attention fixed on the venue's progress, the coming weeks will determine whether Mexico's most iconic stadium is ready to deliver - or whether organizers will be forced into a last-minute adjustment.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Hansi Flick refused to blame a controversial refereeing decision for Barcelona's shock 2-1 defeat to Girona, instead lamenting his side's defensive errors. The Blaugrana took the lead through Pau Cubarsi but crumbled late on, with Fran Beltran netting a controversial winner after a potential foul on Jules Kounde. The result leaves Barca trailing Real Madrid in the title race, compounding a miserable week after their 4-0 Copa del Rey defeat against Atletico Madrid.

Barcelona stumbled in the Catalan derby, surrendering a lead to lose 2-1 at the Estadi Montilivi in a match filled with drama and missed opportunities. The visitors initially broke the deadlock just before the hour mark when defender Cubarsi looped a header into the top corner from a Kounde cross. However, the joy was short-lived as Girona responded almost immediately, with Thomas Lemar tapping home to equalise and ignite the home crowd.

The match was decided in the 86th minute under a cloud of controversy when substitute Beltran struck the winner. Barcelona players were furious, claiming Kounde had been fouled by Claudio Echeverri in the build-up to the goal, but the referee waved play on and a subsequent VAR check allowed the goal to stand. To add to the chaos, Girona finished the match with 10 men after Joel Roca was shown a straight red card in stoppage time for a lunging challenge on Lamine Yamal.

It was a frustrating evening for the Blaugrana, characterised by lethargic attacking play and costly errors. Yamal was particularly unfortunate, missing a penalty in the first half by crashing his effort off the post while the score was still 0-0.

This defeat serves as a significant blow to Flick's title aspirations, shifting the momentum firmly in favour of their arch-rivals. The loss leaves Barcelona trailing Real Madrid by two points at the summit of La Liga, a gap that could prove decisive as the season enters its critical stages. With Los Blancos showing relentless consistency in the league with eight straight wins, dropping points against a team fighting relegation is a setback Barca can ill afford.

""Our positioning, especially in midfield, wasn't good,"" Flick said when asked for his thoughts on the game. ""We were too open. We need to calm down. We made a lot of mistakes. We have a long week ahead; I'll give the players two days off so they can reset and improve. There's a long way to go; we're currently in second place.""

Despite the clear frustration among his players regarding the winning goal, Flick refused to hide behind the referee's decision during his post-match press conference. When asked about the potential foul on Kounde, the German coach admitted it looked like a foul but insisted that using it as an alibi would be wrong. 

""What do you think? A foul, right? No need to say anything more,"" he said, later adding: ""If we had played well, I could criticize the decision... but I don't want it to be used as an excuse.""

On the other side, Girona boss Michel was quick to defend the legitimacy of his team's victory, dismissing the idea that the result hinged on a single whistle. ""I think it's unfair to talk about just one play after the spectacle we saw,"" Michel argued.

Yamal's penalty miss marked a rare moment of fallibility for the young superstar who has otherwise been a revelation for Barcelona. Usually composed beyond his years, the winger spurned the chance to give his side the lead, a moment that could have changed the entire complexion of the derby.

For Girona, this victory was historic and statistically vital for their survival hopes. Michel described it as ""Girona's best game of the season,"" a massive claim considering their struggles near the relegation zone. Beating Barcelona is not just a morale booster; the three points moved them up to 12th place, providing a five-point cushion above the drop zone and potentially turning their season around.

Barcelona now face a crucial period of reflection as they attempt to arrest this mini-slump before it derails their season completely. Flick has promised to give his players two days off to ""reset and improve"" mentally and physically after a gruelling week. The coaching staff will use this time to analyse the defensive errors that cost them points at Montilivi and prepare for the challenges ahead.

There is a silver lining on the horizon for the Blaugrana in the form of returning personnel. Flick hinted that key players are on the verge of coming back, specifically mentioning that Pedri and Marcus Rashford may return soon, which would provide the spark and stability the team desperately lacked in midfield and attack against Girona.

Looking ahead to the fixture list, there is no room for further slip-ups if Barcelona wants to reclaim the top spot. They host Levante on Sunday, a match that has now become a must-win encounter to keep the pressure on Real Madrid. ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Former Manchester United star Anthony Martial was stretchered off during his latest Liga MX outing for Monterrey after suffering a horror injury, which required hospital treatment. The Frenchman was withdrawn just before half-time in his side's 1-0 win over Club Leon after dislocating his shoulder, and is now set for a spell on the sidelines.

According to talkSPORT, Martial will be out of action for four to six weeks if he does not need to undergo surgery on the issue. However, any operation would see that recovery time increase to between three and six months.

The injury blow compounds what has been a miserable spell in Liga MX for Martial, who moved to Monterrey from AEK Athens in September. The ex-United striker has only scored once in 19 appearances for the Mexican club to date. 

Martial sustained the injury when falling awkwardly after challenging for a loose ball, and eventually left the stadium in an ambulance to receive treatment at a local hospital - per Soy Futbol. Monterrey confirmed Martial's diagnosis in an official statement, which read: ""Club de Futbol Monterrey reports that player Anthony Martial suffered a dislocated right shoulder during the Matchday 6 game against Leon at BBVA Stadium. Anthony's recovery prognosis is subject to change.""

Martial is almost certain to miss Monterrey's next three games in the Liga MX Clausura against Pumas UNAM, Cruz Azul and Queretaro. His absence will come as a big blow to the club, who are currently sitting in sixth place in the Clausura standings.

Monterrey paid a reported $4.5m fee to sign Martial, and he is under contract at the Estadio BBVA until the end of 2027. The transfer initially saw Martial link up with Real Madrid legend Sergio Ramos, but the former Spain international left Monterrey in December after deciding not to sign an extension.

Martial's career has taken a steep nosedive since his permanent exit from Old Trafford. The France international left United after nine years to join AEK Athens in 2024, after a brief loan stint at Sevilla, and scored seven goals in 16 league games for the Greek side, but injury problems limited his playing time.

Struggles for form and fitness have ultimately prevented Martial from unlocking his full potential, and now at the ripe old age of 30, it remains to be seen if he can bounce back from his latest setback and succeed on the elite stage again.

Gordon Ramsay insists that close friend Sir David Beckham is an “incredible dad” and believes time will heal a rift that has torn one of the world's most famous families apart. Brooklyn Beckham has become engulfed in a stunning feud with his iconic parents, claiming that he has no plans to reconcile. Ramsay is confident that bridges will be rebuilt.

There is no sign of that happening any time soon, with Brooklyn - the eldest son of Manchester United legend David and former Spice Girls pop star Victoria - recently aiming an explosive blast at his mother and father during a stunning rant on social media.

Ramsay, who has known the Beckhams for more than two decades, has been on hand to offer support to Brooklyn, who was an aspiring chef at one stage. He is able to sit on both sides of a surprising divide.

The 59-year-old Michelin-starred restaurateur has told The Sun: “It's a very difficult situation. Victoria is upset, and I know 24/7, seven days a week, just how much David loves Brooklyn.

“Brooklyn and I have messaged a little bit, our relationship is solid. I love him – his heart is incredible. But it's hard, isn't it, when you're infatuated? Love is blind. It's easy to get up on that rollercoaster, and get carried away. But it will come back.

“I've seen first-hand just how good parents they are. David as a dad is just incredible. They've both put so much energy into their kids, and I know just how many times they've got Brooklyn out of the sh*t.

“I think it's going to be a matter of time before Brooklyn takes a good look at himself and understands just what his parents mean to him. He's desperate to forge his own way, and I respect that from him. It's such a good thing to do. But remember where you came from. And honestly, one day you're not going to have your mum and dad, and you need to understand that. That penny will drop. 

“I just want Brooklyn to take a moment to himself. And remember: you're half mum, half dad. And you're an amazing young man. But, boy, they've done more for you than anyone did in your entire life. Time's going to be the best healer, and David will absolutely get that relationship back on track.”

Ramsay and his wife Tana have been pals with the Beckhams for nearly 25 years. The outspoken Scot, who is famed for his foul-mouthed rants in the kitchen, is among those to have been left stunned by Brooklyn's claims that his mother danced inappropriately at his wedding to Nicola Peltz.

Asked to set that record straight, Ramsay said: “There was nothing salacious. There was nothing inappropriate. Everyone was having fun, having a dance.”

Pressed further on whether “grinding” took place, Ramsay added: “No! Nothing of the sort. It was fun. I haven't seen any of the memes, I heard about them of course, but Victoria's got a great sense of humour.

“She's great. She's right to be upset (about the wedding) but she can bat that other sh*t away in a heartbeat. Victoria and Tana have spoken a lot, they are probably closer than ever – they're like two peas in a pod, those two.”

David and Victoria have steered clear of their family feud when making public appearances. Brooklyn has also faded back out of the spotlight after stating how he wants to focus on his marriage to Peltz for the foreseeable future. He has made no contact with his parents or siblings Romeo, Cruz and Harper.

Ex-England captain David Beckham has plenty on his plate at present, as he continues to work alongside Argentine GOAT Lionel Messi as a co-owner of MLS Cup winners Inter Miami. A new season in the United States is fast approaching, while eyes are also being kept on Salford City's promotion push in League Two - having bought into that club alongside former United team-mate Gary Neville.

Our soccer expert offers his Benfica vs Real Madrid predictions, ahead of Tuesday's Champions League clash, at 3:00pm ET (2/17).

Our betting expert expects a relatively open game, with the Portuguese side capable of upsetting Los Blancos once more.

All odds are courtesy of bet365, correct at the time of publishing and subject to change.

Benfica's victory three weeks ago was no fluke. They were the superior side in that match against a shaky Real Madrid, who only needed a draw.

The hosts created eight big chances and generated 3.01 xG across the 90 minutes. Real Madrid finished with an xG total of 1.51, despite dominating possession.

Benfica exploited their opponents' problems at right-back, with left winger Andreas Schjelderup scoring twice. Since then, Alvaro Arbeloa has opted to move Fede Valverde back into midfield. However, neither Dani Carvajal nor Trent Alexander-Arnold has managed to build up much match fitness following recent injuries.

Jude Bellingham and Eder Militao are out injured, while Kylian Mbappe has not trained fully in the week before this game. Those issues point to another potentially tricky night for the visitors. Backing Benfica to win or draw carries an implied probability of 53.5%.

Raul Asencio's late red card in the last meeting rules him out for Tuesday. The youngster has been one of the more reliable Real Madrid defenders in recent months.

While the Spanish giants tend to keep it tight in La Liga, it has been a different story in Europe. Against more attack-minded opponents, Real Madrid conceded 1.5 goals per game in the UCL league phase. They also allowed 13.0 xG in total, which was the 14th-worst record.

Aside from long-term absentee Dodi Lukebakio, Benfica's attack should be at full strength. Schjelderup should cause problems again, while Vangelis Pavlidis has been prolific in Portugal this term. He has also registered two goals and two assists in the Champions League.

Backing the hosts to score over 1.5 goals offers value, with an implied probability of 41.7%.

The recent encounter was goalless until the 30th minute, but exploded into life after that. There has also been a clear overall trend of late goals since Alvaro Arbeloa took charge of Real Madrid.

The first four Los Blancos matches under Arbeloa's guidance all served up more goals in the second half than the first. The Benfica game broke that run, with three goals either side of the break. However, the pattern resumed in league games against Rayo Vallecano and Valencia.

Benfica conceded eight times after the break in the UCL league phase. That was twice as many goals as they let in during the first half.

Mourinho is unlikely to take unnecessary risks from the first whistle here. However, he knows that Benfica need to make home advantage count, so the match should eventually open up. Backing the second half to serve up the most goals looks like the smart bet.

Benfica beat Real Madrid 4-2 on the final matchday in the league phase last month. Goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin scored a dramatic fourth goal in stoppage time and sealed progress for Jose Mourinho's team.

That result also denied Real Madrid direct passage into the round of 16. They must now negotiate a two-legged play-off tie against the same opposition.

Since that remarkable night, Benfica have lost further ground in the Portuguese title race after only drawing with Tondela. Meanwhile, Real Madrid bounced back from that setback with league wins over Rayo Vallecano and Valencia.

Benfica expected lineup: Trubin, Dahl, T. Araujo, Otamendi, Dedic, Barreiro, Aursnes, Schjelderup, Sudakov, Prestianni, Pavlidis

Real Madrid expected lineup: Courtois, Carreras, Huijsen, Rudiger, Alexander-Arnold, Camavinga, Tchouameni, Valverde, Guler, Vinicius, Mbappe","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Girona star Claudio Echeverri has confessed he may have fouled Jules Kounde in the buildup to Fran Beltran's decisive goal during Monday's fiery Catalan derby. Barcelona were left fuming as the 86th-minute strike stood despite a VAR check, eventually falling to a 2-1 defeat at Montilivi. The result sees Hansi Flick's side slip two points behind Real Madrid in the title race, as Lamine Yamal's penalty miss proved costly on a night of intense controversy.

Manchester City loanee Echeverri played a central role in a controversial late winner for Girona. With the match poised at 1-1, the Argentine youngster challenged Kounde, leading to Beltran firing home the decisive goal in the 86th minute. Despite furious protests from theBlaugrana bench and a subsequent VAR review, the officials allowed the goal to stand, sealing a famous victory for the hosts.

The match had earlier seen Yamal miss a golden opportunity to put Barcelona ahead, striking the base of the post from the penalty spot in first-half stoppage time. Although Pau Cubarsi opened the scoring with a looping header, Thomas Lemar equalised almost immediately, setting the stage for the late drama. Echeverri's admission after the final whistle has only added fuel to the fire of Barcelona's frustration following a difficult week for the Catalan giants.

Echeverri himself was candid when speaking to the press, acknowledging that contact was made with the French defender during the high-speed transition. ""Yes, I stepped on Kounde's foot, but I was running at speed and didn't do it on purpose,"" he admitted. “If the referee had given it as a foul, I would have understood.”

This defeat marks a significant shift in the Spanish league title race, as Barcelona now find themselves trailing arch-rivals Real Madrid by two points. Having recently suffered a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Atletico Madrid in the Copa del Rey, back-to-back losses have raised serious questions about the mental fortitude of Flick's side. The lack of clinical finishing, epitomised by Yamal's uncharacteristic struggles, has handed the momentum back to the capital.

For Girona, these three points represent a massive lifeline in their fight against the drop. By ending a three-game winless run, Michel's side has moved five points clear of the relegation zone and up to 12th in the table. 

While Girona manager Michel argued that the play did not warrant a review because it occurred during a fast break, the admission from the offending player suggests a breakdown in the communication between the pitch and the VAR booth. This incident is likely to dominate the headlines as Barcelona attempts to regroup for their upcoming clash against Levante.

Michel was quick to defend the integrity of the victory, urging critics not to focus solely on the late controversy. ""To dwell on one play after the spectacle we witnessed seems to diminish the quality of football,"" he told reporters. He characterised the match as a ""fantastic spectacle"" and one of the best performances of his coaching career, emphasising that his team's hard work deserved the points regardless of the singular incident involving Kounde.

Michel also took the opportunity to praise standout performer Daley Blind as well as Barca goalkeeper Joan Garcia. He described Blind's performance as a ""masterclass"" in defending against high-pressing teams and credited Garcia for being ""Barca's best player"" during the early stages of the match. According to Michel, the victory serves as a ""turning point"" for a club that wasn't even expecting to take points off the league leaders.

Barca coach Flick refused to focus on the controversial decision, saying he would not use it as an excuse for his team's loss. ""What do you think? A foul, right? No need to say anything more,"" he said, later adding: ""If we had played well, I could criticize the decision... but I don't want it to be used as an excuse.""

Cubarsi's opening goal was a landmark moment for the teenage defender, marking his first-ever goal in La Liga. At just 19 years old, he continues to be one of the few bright spots in a defensive unit that has struggled for consistency in recent weeks. However, his milestone was overshadowed by the fact that Barcelona failed to keep a clean sheet for the fourth consecutive game across all competitions.

Yamal's penalty miss adds to a growing statistical anomaly for the young winger, who has been otherwise sensational this season. This was the first time in his professional career that he has failed to convert from the spot in a senior match. 

Barcelona now faces a gruelling mental recovery period as they watch Real Madrid attempt to extend their lead to five points against Osasuna. With no midweek games scheduled, Flick has the luxury of time but the burden of immense scrutiny. The upcoming fixture against Levante is now a ""must-win"" if they are to prevent a mid-season collapse from spiralling into a full-blown crisis, especially with the second leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final looming.

Girona will look to build on this momentum as they travel to face mid-table opposition in their quest to mathematically secure safety. The development of Echeverri remains a key narrative for the City Football Group as he continues to acclimate to European football.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Tottenham brutally told why Harry Kane will snub emotional return from Bayern Munich as 'ultimate' striker is tipped to join Real Madrid or Barcelona","https://www.goal.com/en-ug/lists/tottenham-brutally-told-why-harry-kane-snub-return-bayern-munich-ultimate-striker-real-madrid-barcelona/blt60bd4da29dd5164f","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 14:24:35 GMT","

Tottenham have been brutally informed that there is no chance of Harry Kane pulling on their famous lilywhite shirt again. The England captain severed career-long ties with Spurs in 2023 as the club's all-time leading scorer and lifted his trophy curse in Germany with Bayern Munich. A return to the Premier League has been mooted, but Bobby Zamora has told GOAL why such a switch is unlikely to happen.

Kane walked away from north London as Tottenham's all-time leading scorer, having recorded 280 goals through 435 appearances. Major silverware proved elusive, leading to a big-money move to the Allianz Arena being made.

Tangible success has been savoured there, becoming a Bundesliga title winner, while stunning individual standards have been maintained by a man who now has 500 career goals to his name - becoming the first Englishman to hit that milestone.

Many have suggested that Kane could be tempted to head back to his homeland and chase down Alan Shearer's Premier League goal record. Spurs would be given the chance to match any offers for their former fan favourite. 

Zamora cannot see a deal being agreed, with the former frontman - speaking in association with William Hill - telling GOAL when asked if we will ever see Kane playing for Tottenham again: “I don't think we will. He's happy there and doing very, very well. It will be interesting. I can't see it.

“If he comes back to England for a last hurrah, I think he will want a real opportunity to win one of the major trophies in England. If it's one season, or two seasons he has back in the Premier League, he will certainly want to give himself the opportunity to win something - because obviously he never managed that at Spurs. As things stand, they don't look like frontrunners to be able to nab him, in my opinion.”

Another former Spurs star, Danny Murphy, told GOAL recently when asked if Kane back to Spurs could become a 50/50 call: “I would think much less. Harry Kane is succeeding where he is at the moment - more than succeeding, he's flying and scoring a lot of goals. He's in a team where he thinks he can compete for the Champions League. He's won his first league title, first trophy.

“There is always the family factor. We can never know about how that is. I remember Michael Owen being in Spain and a year in just wanting to come home with the family. We don't know that side of Kane's life. But from a football perspective, to go back to Tottenham, there is only one reason he would go back there and that's because of the fact that the fans love him. In terms of football reasons, it would be to try and break Alan Shearer's record.

“The way he is playing, if he wanted to leave Munich, I think he would have other options where he could go to another club and compete for the biggest honours on the planet - domestic titles and the Champions League. It sounds romantic going back to Tottenham but the reality is that he'd be going there to win a League Cup or an FA Cup. It's a downgrade. He would be downgrading. His level of performance at the moment, he doesn't need to.”

Bayern have claimed that release clauses in Kane's contract, which were said to come in at £57 million ($77m), have now expired. He is, however, only tied to terms until 2027 and may decide that he has another new challenge in him.

There has been talk of La Liga giants Barcelona and Real Madrid showing interest, with Zamora adding when asked if a switch to Spain would be a sensible career move: “Yeah, I think so. He's still absolutely banging in goals, still an absolute threat. The likes of Real Madrid would fit very well, create chances - Barcelona as well - give him that ball in the box and he's going to score you goals. 

“He's the ultimate. Any of those teams that create a couple of chances a game will certainly be looking at him because they know it's going to be goals every single week. If you put the ball into a certain area, with Harry, he is going to score.”

Kane has found the target on 41 occasions for Bayern this season, through 35 appearances. He has 26 efforts in the Bundesliga and is chasing down Robert Lewandowski's single campaign record - which stands at 41.

After bringing another bid for domestic and continental honours to a close, with Champions League dreams also being clung to, Kane - who is his country's record scorer - will captain England at the 2026 World Cup.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

“I live here now. I have an apartment 20 minutes from here, so it's like my home tournament,” Michelsen said. “It's great. I'm from California but I emigrated here. I absolutely love it here. Everyone's so nice.”

After triumphing in his first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Vacherot, Michelsen can look ahead to a second-round meeting with Sebastian Korda or Mackenzie McDonald.


Another local favourite advanced through when eighth seed Frances Tiafoe ousted Australian qualifier Rinky Hijikata 6-4, 6-4 in just 73 minutes.
""I'm happy, I'm happy. Really happy about it. I thought I played pretty well tonight. I hope you guys enjoyed it, it was fun. Good stuff,"" Tiafoe said. ""Thanks everybody for coming out. It's nice to have another home tournament.""
Tiafoe won his first ATP Tour title in Delray Beach in 2018 and is now 12-4 at the tournament. He will next take on another American: Aleksandar Kovacevic or qualifier Zachary Svajda.

Could Alejandro Tabilo be poised for a big week on clay in Brazil?

The Chilean lefty made a good start to his Rio Open presented by Claro on Monday when he ousted American Emilio Nava 6-3, 6-3 in only 63 minutes.

Tabilo is fresh off a run to the quarter-finals at the ATP 250 event in Buenos Aires, where he beat Joao Fonseca. Now the former No. 19 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, a three-time ATP Tour champion, will pursue his first ATP 500 title.

The victor claimed 86 per cent of his service points according to Infosys ATP Stats and did not face a break point against the American. Tabilo will next play qualifier Dino Prizmic or lucky loser Francesco Passaro.

German Yannick Hanfmann also came out of the gates well with a 7-6(3), 6-4 triumph against Brazilian wild card Joao Lucas Reis Da Silva. 

“Very satisfied, of course. Getting through a tough first match playing a Brazilian on the centre court is not the easiest task,” Hanfmann said. “I knew that, especially a night session. I served quite well, tried to stay composed throughout the whole match. I knew it was going to be tricky.”



Serbian Dusan Lajovic, an ATP Masters 1000 finalist on clay at Monte-Carlo in 2019, earned his first Lexus ATP Head2Head series win against Daniel Altmaier 6-4, 7-6(7). Altmaier still leads their series 2-1.

Other players who advanced on the first day of the main draw were Thiago Agustin Tirante, a 7-5, 6-3 winner against Cristian Garin, and Ignacio Buse, who rallied past qualifier Igor Marcondes 4-6, 7-5, 6-4. Vit Kopriva also reached the second round with a 6-2, 7-6(5) victory against wild card Gustavo Heide.

In the only doubles match of the day, Brazilian sensation Joao Fonseca partnered countryman Marcelo Melo past alternates Roman Andres Burruchaga and Andrea Pellegrino 6-4, 6-4. It was the first tour-level doubles win of Fonseca's career.

The new Tour Architecture Council will recommend actionable improvements to the Tour framework that can be implemented as soon as the 2027 season.

On Tuesday, WTA Chair Valerie Camillo announced the launch of the new Tour Architecture Council to recommend actionable improvements to the Tour framework that can be implemented as soon as the 2027 season.

Here is Valerie's letter, in full:

Dear Players and Tournament Partners,

One of the most rewarding parts of stepping into my role as WTA Chair has been witnessing firsthand the momentum behind women's tennis, driven by our world-class players, incredible tournaments and dedicated fans. The 2026 season is off to a strong start, with elite competition and enthusiastic global fan engagement setting the stage for an exciting year and continued growth.

As Chair, it is my priority to help the WTA capitalize on this momentum and opportunity for the benefit of our members. Accordingly, I've spent time listening to and learning from players and tournaments to understand what is working -- and what isn't -- on Tour.  Over my first 90 days, there has been a clear sentiment across the Tour that the current calendar does not feel sustainable for players given the physical, professional and personal pressures of competing at the highest level. It's important we take a fresh, collaborative look at how to best preserve the high-quality competition that builds value for tournaments and provides an unparalleled experience for fans.

For this reason, today I am establishing the Tour Architecture Council, a representative working group convened by the WTA to develop meaningful improvements to the calendar, commitments and other core elements of the Tour framework. 

This group's initial mandate is to develop actionable recommendations for consideration by the WTA Board that can be implemented as soon as the 2027 season. The Council will focus first on areas where the WTA has direct authority to drive change, while also identifying longer-term opportunities that will require broader coordination across the sport.

The Council includes prominent voices from across the global tennis ecosystem, including players from around the world; leaders from premier tournaments across the Americas, Europe, and Asia; and WTA senior leadership -- including myself -- Tour CEO Portia Archer, and experts in Tour operations and calendar planning.

The Council will be chaired by current World No. 5 player Jessica Pegula. As Chair, Jessica brings an active top-player perspective to the Council's work. She will help guide discussions so they reflect the full range of different player experiences on Tour, while working alongside tournament representatives and WTA leadership as the group works to turn these perspectives into action. I am grateful to Jessica and all of the members of the Council for committing their valuable time and expertise to this important effort.

The WTA is uniquely positioned to do this work. Our structure allows us to bring together athletes and tournaments to make decisions impacting the future of our sport. For more than 50 years, this model has resulted in our players being recognized as some of the most renowned and highly compensated athletes in the world, and enabled global expansion for the Tour at an unprecedented level, with attendance and viewership surging. In today's environment, the WTA's convening power and the ability to translate feedback is the most powerful tool we have to deliver real change.

Women's tennis is a global growth engine for our sport, and the WTA is well-equipped to respond with clarity and purpose to today's realities and help position the Tour for continued success. I am grateful to serve as Chair at this important moment, and I look forward to working together to make informed and aligned decisions that support our athletes and the long-term strength of women's tennis.

Thank you for your continued engagement and commitment to our sport.

Sincerely,

Valerie CamilloChair, WTA

After announcing that this would be his last year on the tour, Stan Wawrinka has made a strong start to 2026, already winning five matches—which is more than he won the entire year in 2025.Today, after reaching the second round at the ATP 500 event in Rotterdam, he's rewarded with a return to the Top 100 for the first time since 2024, rising from No. 106 to No. 98 on the ATP rankings.And that's not all.At 40 years young, Wawrinka is the first 40-something to be ranked in the Top 100 of the ATP rankings since none other than Roger Federer in 2022, during Wimbledon that year.Federer, who was also 40 at the time, was ranked No. 97 during the weeks of June 27th and July 4th, 2022. He was already retired, but he fell out of the Top 100 for the last time—and off the rankings completely—on July 11th, 2022, when his points from reaching the quarterfinals of Wimbledon the year before dropped off.The last 40-something in the elite before Federer was Ivo Karlovic, who was also 40 when he was No. 95 the week of December 30th, 2019. He fell out for the last time on January 6th, 2020.And Feliciano Lopez almost achieved the feat in 2021, but he fell out of the Top 100 for the last time on September 13th of that year, exactly one week before his 40th birthday (September 20th, 2021).

 Bahrain Test 1: What we learned day 3 

Craig Skinner has departed the Red Bull team, having first joined the squad back in 2006.

Red Bull's Chief Designer Craig Skinner has left the Formula 1 team with immediate effect, the six-time World Champions have confirmed.

Skinner joined Red Bull in 2006 and worked closely with Adrian Newey, who has since left to join Aston Martin, and Pierre Wache, who heads up Red Bull's technical division.

He played a key role in Red Bull's success when they won consecutive world titles between 2021 and 2024 with Max Verstappen.

Red Bull, under the leadership of Laurent Mekies, enjoyed a resurgence at the back end of last year following a raft of updates on the car, which in turn enabled Verstappen to win six of the last nine races and fight for the title until the season finale.

Ahead of the second pre-season test in Bahrain, it has emerged Skinner has left the team but it remains unclear what his next move will be.

Red Bull said in a statement: ""After 20 years with the team, Craig Skinner, our Chief Designer, will be leaving the Red Bull Technology team.

""Craig has been an integral part of our team and its success, and we would like to thank him for his hard work and commitment. The whole Red Bull team wishes him all the best for the future.""

Following his departure, it is believed his role will be covered internally in the interim.

Red Bull have enjoyed a strong start to their 2026 campaign, with their first-ever Formula 1 Power Unit, in partnership with Ford, running very reliably while its deployment performance has turned heads.

They will join their 10 rival teams in Bahrain once again this week for three more days of pre-season testing before everyone heads to Australia for the season-opener on March 6-8.

 Bahrain Test 1: What we learned day 3 

With the second pre-season test in Bahrain fast approaching, Ferrari's Fred Vasseur is anticipating several significant upgrades across the field.

Ferrari Team Principal Fred Vasseur is “convinced” that most teams will “bring huge upgrades” to the second pre-season test in Bahrain, with the Frenchman also setting out his expectations for how the development race could initially unfold.

Prior to the 2026 season getting underway – in which a wave of new technical regulations have been introduced – Vasseur suggested that the Scuderia would bring a “spec A” version of their challenger to the Barcelona Shakedown and pre-season testing in order to gain mileage before later focusing on performance.

With the first of two tests at the Bahrain International Circuit now complete, Ferrari completed a solid lap number of laps across the three days of action – with only McLaren and Williams holding higher lap counts – and Vasseur was left feeling positive about what the squad achieved.

Pushed on whether he felt that the “spec A” plan had worked well, the team boss responded: “Yeah, on this side I would say so far so good, that we did something like 4,500km so far.

“It went pretty well on the reliability side, and it's the best way to collect data and to try to understand what are the options and how we can improve the car step by step. We are not speaking at all about performance so far, but everybody is focused on themselves.

“We can't make any comparison, but so far it went well on our side to build up the knowledge of the car step by step. It's still a long way to go.”

After bringing new parts to the SF-26 during the opening Bahrain test, Vasseur believes that most of the field will continue to do this when the second test takes place from February 18-20.

“I'm really convinced that everybody will bring huge upgrades next week and perhaps again in Melbourne,” he explained.

“And it will be like this at the beginning of the season because the rate of development is very, very high and it makes sense to speed up the new parts and the lead time on the new parts, but I'm focused on myself.”

In terms of how happy he is with where Ferrari are currently at with their pre-season programme, Vasseur added: “You always want to do more – you always want to do more laps, but overall I think it went pretty well, that we didn't have any big issue on the reliability, that we didn't stop the car so far.

“This is good – we have a good correlation, it's positive. But it's nothing about performance – it's about the quality of work that we are doing in the development.”

His family said he “died peacefully on Tuesday morning, surrounded by his family.""


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	The Reverend Jesse Jackson, a widely respected U.S. civil rights leader, has died at the age 84. His family said in a statement that Jackson “died peacefully on Tuesday morning, surrounded by his family.”


	He rose to prominence in the 1960s as a leader in Martin Luther King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Jackson was actually present when King was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., in 1968.




	That year, he was ordained a minister. Later, he was awarded a Master of Divinity degree by Chicago Theological Seminary in 2000, based on a mix of earned credits and his work and life experience.

	Jackson later launched two social justice and activism organisations. In 1971, he founded Operation PUSH, followed in 1984 by the National Rainbow Coalition, which merged with PUSH in 1996.

	While known for his civil rights activism, Jackson also ran for president in 1984, becoming the second African American to do so after Shirley Chisholm. He was a candidate for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination that year and again in 1988, but didn't win the nomination.


In 2017, at Cannes Lions, Jackson called out Hollywood and Silicon Valley for their lack of diversity and pushed the audience — made up mostly of advertisers and marketers — to use their media reach to promote positive messages for women, people of color and the LGBTQ community. 

	











	Jackson's high-profile work also attracted the entertainment industry's attention in other ways. Actors who have portrayed Jackson on screen include Nigel Gibbs in the TV series Monster (2022), and Eddie Murphy famously parodied Jackson on Saturday Night Live in 1984. Plus, the Reverend appeared as himself in a 1989 episode of A Different World.


	In 2017, Jackson was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. He was hospitalized in November after being diagnosed with a degenerative condition.


	“It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of Civil Rights leader and founder of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the Honorable Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson, Sr.,” the Jackson family statement said. “He died peacefully on Tuesday morning, surrounded by his family. His unwavering commitment to justice, equality, and human rights helped shape a global movement for freedom and dignity. A tireless change agent, he elevated the voices of the voiceless from his Presidential campaigns in the 1980s to mobilising millions to register to vote – leaving an indelible mark on history.”


	It continued: “Reverend Jackson is survived by his wife, Jacqueline; their children – Santita, Jesse Jr., Jonathan, Yusef, Jacqueline; daughter Ashley Jackson, and grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his mother, Helen Burns Jackson; father, Noah Louis Robinson; and stepfather, Charles Henry Jackson.” Concluded the family statement: “Our father was a servant leader – not only to our family, but to the oppressed, the voiceless, and the overlooked around the world. We shared him with the world, and in return, the world became part of our extended family. His unwavering belief in justice, equality, and love uplifted millions, and we ask you to honour his memory by continuing the fight for the values he lived by.' Public observances will be held in Chicago. Final arrangements for Reverend Jackson's celebration of life services, including all public events, will be released by the Rainbow PUSH Coalition.”

The captivating Hulu drama starring Grace Van Patten and Jackson White will release its final episode Monday at 9 p.m. PT/12 a.m. ET.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Tell Me Lies is ending the cycle of Lucy and Stephen.


Meaghan Oppenheimer, the creator of Hulu‘s buzzy drama starring Grace Van Patten and Jackson White, announced on Monday that the show won't be returning for a fourth season. The news comes ahead of the highly anticipated season three finale, which releases at 9 p.m. PT/12 a.m. ET on Monday.




	“After three amazing seasons of Tell Me Lies, tonight's episode will be the series finale,” Oppenheimer wrote on Instagram. “This was always the ending my writing team and I had in mind, and we are insanely proud of it. Your incredible response to this season inspired us to explore whether there was another organic way to continue the story, but ultimately we felt it had reached its natural conclusion.”

	She continued, “My main goal has always been to protect the quality of the show and give you the best experience I can give you. And so, while it is bittersweet to leave something that has been such a happy experience, I am very grateful that we are able to tell a complete story with an intentional ending – a privilege very few shows get. Thank you for loving our show. We are excited to bring you more stories in the near future.”


Tell Me Lies follows Lucy and Stephen's addictive and toxic relationship, and how it permanently alters their lives and the lives of everyone around them over the course of eight years. The tumultuous couple at the center of the saga is played by Van Patten and White, who have been dating in real life ever since meeting during the audition process for the series.

	











	The drama on Tell Me Lies unfolds in two timelines; one in the 2008 backdrop of the fictional Baird College, and the future timeline set in 2015 around the wedding of Bree (Cat Missal) and Evan (Branden Cook), a celebratory few months that reunites the group of college friends.


	The cast also includes Spencer House, Sonia Mena, Alicia Crowder, Gabriella Pession, Tom Ellis, Costa D'Angelo and Natalee Linez.


	Last month, ahead of the season three premiere, The Hollywood Reporter asked Oppenheimer how many seasons she had envisioned for the show, and if she stuck with that vision when making season three.


	“I can't really give a specific answer to that question right now, but I would say the ending of the season is always how I had imagined the ending being,” she teased at the time. “In terms of what could happen beyond that, who knows? But I had always imagined those two timelines culminating together in the way that they do this season. But there are a lot of things that happen within the seasons that are huge surprises, obviously.”


	When speaking with THR throughout the season, the cast raved about Oppenheimer's “perfect” finale, expressing support for the show whether it should continue or end here. “I love the ending so much. It's an amazing ending, if it was the end,” Van Patten told THR in a chat about the penultimate episode. “I also think they are amazing writers, and that Meaghan could think something up to continue the story. So I'd be very happy either way.”

Her comments came after the L.A. Olympics Committee board publicly backed Wasserman, who announced the sale of his company last week.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


	Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is calling on Casey Wasserman to step down as chairperson of LA28 after some emails of his surfaced in the Department of Justice's Jeffrey Epstein document release.


	During an interview on CNN Monday, the mayor said, “I cannot fire him, but I have an opinion. And my opinion is that he should step down. That's not the opinion of the board.”




	Last week, Wasserman was publicly backed by the Los Angeles Olympics Committee board after they hired an outside law firm to review his interactions with Ghislaine Maxwell, the convicted sex trafficker connected to Epstein. Their flirtatious correspondence took place in 2003, years before Epstein's arrest in Palm Beach. “LA28 takes allegations of misconduct seriously, and our Board is committed to thoroughly reviewing any concerns related to the organization's leadership,” the executive committee wrote. “Mr. Wasserman fully cooperated with the review. We found Mr. Wasserman's relationship with Epstein and Maxwell did not go beyond what has already been publicly documented.”

	Bass made it clear in today's interview that she disagreed with the board's decision. “Here, LA28, which is the committee that is involved with the Olympics, has the discretion,” she told CNN. “The board made a decision. I think that decision was unfortunate. I don't support the decision. I do think that we need to look at the leadership.”


	The mayor also called Maxwell's behavior “abhorrent.”


	Bass's new comments come after she previously avoided commenting on the Wasserman controversy, saying last week that “any decision on the LA28 leadership must be made by the LA28 Board.” It's unclear what prompted her about-face on Wasserman, who has raised millions of dollars during his decade-long bid to bring the games to the city.

	











	But the mogul has faced a mountain of public backlash, and a spate of client defections, since the massive trove of additional  DoJ documents on Epstein were released on Jan. 30. A number of artists, including Chappell Roan and John Summit, have either left his agency already or threatened to leave if he didn't resign.


	After previously saying he “deeply regrets” his past communication with Maxwell, he decided to put his agency up for sale last week amid the controversy, saying that he had “become a distraction” from his company's operations. (Privately, sources say, he has blamed rival agents like Ari Emanuel for helping to fan the controversy that led to his departure from the company.)


	“I'm deeply sorry that my past personal mistakes have caused you so much discomfort,” he wrote in a statement to his 4,000-member staff. “It's not fair to you, and it's not fair to the clients and partners we represent so vigorously and care so deeply about.”


	Elsewhere in the memo, Wasserman said he'll now be devoting his “full attention to delivering Los Angeles an Olympic Games in 2028 that is worthy of this outstanding city.”


	Aside from his decades-old ties to Maxwell, including emails dating back to 2003, Wasserman has maintained that he “never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” aside from a 2002 philanthropic flight to Africa on Epstein's plane with Bill Clinton and others.

The superstar scores his second leader and tackles the top 10 with four songs.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



Bad Bunny's “DtMF” hits No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the superstar's second leader on the list, and first on his own. He previously reigned with “I Like It,” with Cardi B and J Balvin, for a week in July 2018.


	“DtMF” blitzes 10-1 on the Hot 100 following Bad Bunny's Super Bowl LX halftime show spotlight Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, Calif., with “DtMF” the closing song in the set.


	(Notably, Bad Bunny has performed both of his Hot 100 No. 1s at the midpoint of the NFL championship game: he guested on “I Like It” during Shakira's Super Bowl LIV halftime show in 2020.)


	The Spanish-language “DtMF,” which originally reached No. 2 on the Hot 100 in January 2025, heads up four Bad Bunny songs, all of which he performed at the Super Bowl, in the top 10, with two others likewise from his 2025 album Debí Tirar Más Fotos: “Baile Inolvidable,” which bounds 19-2 for a new high, and “Nuevayol,” up 28-5, also a new best. Plus, “Tití Me Preguntó,” from his 2022 LP Un Verano Sin Ti, reenters the chart at No. 7 (after hitting No. 5 that year).


	Check out the full rundown of this week's Hot 100 top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Feb. 21, 2026) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Feb. 18 (one day later than usual due to the Presidents' Day holiday in the United States Feb. 16). For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram. Plus, for all chart rules and explanations, click here.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.




	“DtMF” — on the Rimas label, which leads the Hot 100 for the first time — drew 43 million official streams (up 85% week over week) and 5.3 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 56%) and sold 12,000 (up 262%) in the U.S. Feb. 6-12.


	The single surges 4-1 for a third week atop the Streaming Songs chart, after it led for two weeks in January-February 2025, and bounds 11-2 for a new high on Digital Song Sales.


	The streaming sum of 43 million for “DtMF” marks the highest for a song so far in 2026. It's also the top weekly total for the song, which previously peaked with 34.9 million in its first week at No. 1 on Streaming Songs. Plus, it achieves the top streaming week for a song not primarily in English this decade, surpassing its prior best (which bested the 34.6 million tallied by Eslabón Armado and Peso Pluma's “Ella Baila Sola” in May 2023).


	“DtMF” is the fourth all- or mostly-Spanish-language Hot 100 No. 1, and the first by a soloist and no other billed acts, dating to the chart's 1958 inception. Here are the elite such leaders:




	“DtMF” is the first Hot 100 No. 1 with any portion of its lyrics not in English since HUNTR/X's “Golden, with sections in Korean among its mostly-English lyrics, led for eight weeks last August-October.


	Some more X's and O's as “DtMF” barrels into the Hot 100's end zone: It's the second song in as many years to top the chart following a Super Bowl halftime show performance. On the Feb. 22, 2025, list, Kendrick Lamar scored a gain of 14 as “Not Like Us” rebounded 15-1 for a third week atop the tally. He also claimed half the top 10 that week.


	Here's a summary of the totals, and metric increases, for Bad Bunny's four concurrent top 10s on the latest Hot 100:




	Bad Bunny boasts four simultaneous Hot 100 top 10s for a second time, following his haul on the May 21, 2022, chart — when “Tití Me Preguntó” debuted — as Un Verano Sin Ti launched at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.


	“DtMF” holds for a 47th week at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Latin Songs chart, where it's one of Bad Bunny's 17 leaders. Only “Despacito” (56 weeks) has dominated longer since the survey began in October 1986.


	Olivia Dean's “Man I Need” dips to No. 3 from its No. 2 Hot 100 high, as it adds a third week at No. 1 on the Radio Songs chart (63.3 million, down 4%).


	Ella Langley's “Choosin' Texas” falls to No. 4 a week after it became her first Hot 100 No. 1. It tops the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart for a 12th frame.


	Alex Warren's “Ordinary” backtracks 3-6 on the Hot 100 after 10 weeks at No. 1 beginning last June.


	Taylor Swift's “Opalite” rebounds 11-8 on the Hot 100 after it debuted at its No. 2 high in October as parent album The Life of a Showgirl made its record-shattering entrance on the Billboard 200. The song is up 76% to 14.2 million streams following the Feb. 6 premiere of its official video; it also drew 50.5 million in radio reach (up 8%) and sold 7,000 downloads (up 300%).


	HUNTR/X's “Golden” drops 5-9 on the Hot 100 and Bruno Mars' “I Just Might,” which spent its first two weeks on the Hot 100 at No. 1 in January, slides 4-10, as it leads the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot R&B Songs charts for a fifth week each.

Steinberg crafted classics for Madonna, the Bangles, Heart, Whitney Houston, JoJo, Cyndi Lauper, Demi Lovato and others.

	“The idea for that song came from personal experience,” Billy Steinberg said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times, as chronicled in Fred Bronson's The Billboard Book of Number One Hits, about Madonna's “Like a Virgin.”


	“I wasn't just trying to somehow get that racy word virgin in a lyric,” mused Steinberg, who co-authored the song with longtime writing partner Tom Kelly. “I was saying that I may not really be a virgin — I've been battered romantically and emotionally like many people — but I'm starting a new relationship and it just feels so good it's healing all the wounds and making me feel like I've never done this before, because it's so much deeper and more profound than anything I've ever felt.”


	The song ruled the Billboard Hot 100 for six weeks in 1984-85 and ranks as Madonna's biggest career hit.


	Steinberg's compositions became mainstays in the Hot 100's top 40 from the 1980s to the 2010s, recorded by acts also including the Bangles, Heart, JoJo, Cyndi Lauper and Demi Lovato, whose “Give Your Heart a Break,” which Steinberg co-wrote with Josh Alexander, also hit No. 1 on Billboard's Pop Airplay chart in 2012.


	In honor of Steinberg, who, as announced Feb. 16, died in Los Angeles at age 75, here is a recap of his 15 biggest Hot 100 hits — including five No. 1s — as a songwriter, all enduring top 40 titles and, notably, all sung by women artists.


	As for “Like a Virgin,” after it was written, Bronson noted that Michael Ostin, then of Warner Brothers Records' A&R department, played it for Madonna, after hearing Kelly and Steinberg's demo, and she “went crazy, and immediately knew it was a song for her and that she could make a great record out of it.”


Songwriter Billy Steinberg's Biggest Billboard Hot 100 hits chart is based on actual performance on the weekly Billboard Hot 100, through the Feb. 14, 2026, ranking. Songs are ranked based on an inverse point system, with weeks at No. 1 earning the greatest value and weeks at No. 100 earning the least. Due to changes in chart methodology over the years, eras are weighted to account for different chart turnover rates over various periods.

The Grammy winner also penned hits for Whitney Houston and Demi Lovato, among others.

Billy Steinberg, the Grammy-winning songwriter who co-wrote such pop classics as Madonna's “Like A Virgin,” Cyndi Lauper's “True Colors” and the Bangles' “Eternal Flame” that were some of the biggest, most indelible hits of the 1980s and beyond, has died, his attorney confirmed to Billboard. Steinberg, who was 10 days away from his 76th birthday, died of cancer in Los Angeles.


	In addition to those three songs, Steinberg — who specialized in big, emotional power ballads with impactful, vulnerable lyrics — had two other songs reach No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100: Whitney Houston's “So Emotional” and Heart's Alone,” all co-written with his longtime writing partner, Tom Kelly.  


	The lyricist, who landed chart hits for more than 30 years, also penned such tunes as the Pretenders' “I'll Stand by You,” the Bangles' “In Your Room” and the Divinyls' “I Touch Myself.” Taylor Dayne, Tina Turner, Pat Benatar, Bette Midler, Cheap Trick, Belinda Carlisle and many other artists also recorded his songs.


	In a statement to Billboard, Lauper called Steinberg “great lyricist and a wonderful collaborator. He and Tom had such a way of capturing the range within an emotion, from the subtlety to urgency…For ‘True Colors,' there was a lot of back and forth which I know was hard for him. In the end, he said that I had really invented my own ‘very exquisitely beautiful version' of the song. That really meant a lot to me. It is a special song.”


	“I remember my mom picking me up from elementary school and there was this urgency and magic in the air,” recalls Steinberg's son, Ezra, who is a songwriter signed to Sony Music Publishing. “I asked what was going on, and she said, ‘Dad has a hit.' It was [JoJo‘s 2006 song] ‘Too Little Too Late.' It was the first time I was old enough to really experience one of his hits, and to see the whole process — loving the demo for months, asking him every day when it was coming out, and then finally hearing it on KIIS-FM on the way to and from school. I felt this deep sense of pride and elation. That was magical.”


	A 2011 inductee into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Fresno, California, native grew up in Palm Springs, California. After attending Bard College in New York's Hudson Valley, he pursued a career as an artist with his band Billy Thermal. While they may not have flourished, Steinberg's career took off after the group's guitarist played “How Do I Make You,” penned solely by Steinberg, for Linda Rondstadt, who recorded it for her Mad Love album in 1980. The song reached No. 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.


	Steinberg and Kelly, in addition to recording as the duo I-10 for Epic Records, were one of the top songwriting teams of the ‘80s and ‘90s, often writing signature songs for artists, including “Like A Virgin,” which remained at No. 1 for six weeks, the most of any of Madonna's hits. Billboard ranked the song as Madonna's biggest hit of her career in 2024.


	After Kelly retired as a songwriter, Steinberg continued to write, often with Rick Nowels, including penning Dion's “Falling Into You,” the title track for Dion's 1996 album, which won album of the year for the 39th Grammy Awards and for which both Steinberg and Nowels took home a Grammy.


	The two originally wrote “Falling Into You” with Marie-Claire D'Ubaldo for the Argentine singer's album, but  that album failed to take off. The songwriters bought back the track, complete with Paul Buckmaster string arrangements, for $15,000 so Dion could record it and added her vocals. The song went to No. 1 in a number of countries including Spain and Greece. 


	“Billy began as a poet and he developed a sense for that, an esthetic, where in one sentence or two sentences you can create a whole story. He was a one off. They won't make another one. He had an encyclopedic knowledge, of popular songs and that's where he and I connected,” Nowels says of Steinberg, whom he met in the early '80s through Nowels' wife as the two men were both experiencing their first flushes of success. “We just enjoyed each other's brains. We enjoyed each other's minds. We were friends to the very end.”


	More recently, in the 2010s, Steinberg's songs were cut by Nicole Scherzinger, Miranda Cosgrove and Demi Lovato, who took “Give Your Heart A Break” (co-written with Josh Alexander) to No. 16 on the Hot 100 in 2012.


	At the Grammy Museum's 2023 “The Power of Song: A Songwriters Hall of Fame Exhibit,” Steinberg was represented by a demo for “True Colors” recorded on a TDK SA 60 cassette and a note from Lauper that read, “Billy — Thanks for sending me and writing such a beautiful song. (heart) Cyndi.”


	He is survived by his beloved wife, Trina; his sons, Ezra and Max; his sisters, Barbara and Mary; and his stepchildren, Raul and Carolina.

Rest in Peace, Billy Steinberg! Thank you for leaving us some of the world's best soundtracks!

I got to hang out with Billy & Tom in the 80s. I met them through my brother in law GaryUsher. It was super fun and exciting. They wrote the song True Colors in 15 minutes. So creative. So sad for the music world.

Taylor Swift introduces ""Amber, Alysa and Isabeau, three American showgirls on ice"" in an NBC clip soundtracked by ""Opalite.""


													By
												

	Ashley Iasimone



Taylor Swift‘s “Opalite” is the soundtrack in a new NBC Olympics preview that has the pop star introducing Team USA figure skaters Alysa Liu, Amber Glenn and Isabeau Levito — a trio of athletes also known as “The Blade Angels.”


	“Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce you to Amber, Alysa and Isabeau, three American showgirls on ice who will capture your heart with their stories,” Swift says in a voiceover for the clip, which was released on Monday (Feb. 16) and which goes on to give a brief backstory for three figure skaters competing on the U.S. team. (See NBC's broadcast schedule for figure skating coverage here.)

	











	“Amber will be the first to tell you about how many battles she's fought, and about how the ones she's lost have meant as much as the wins. Her superpower now is embracing the fight and daring the world to test her self-belief,” Swift says of Amber Glenn.




	“As for Alyssa, she walked away from skating when she was 16, but then came back on her own terms. Joy fuels her now. Every jump, a celebration. Every performance, a testament to the beauty of knowing yourself,” adds Swift.


	“And then, Isabeau,” says Swift. “I mean, she's destiny personified. Her mom grew up in Milan, and her nona, her grandma, lived exactly 13 minutes from the Olympic rink. When you skate like you're meant to be out there, history has a funny way of showing up.”


	Swift's — who just released a music video (and a couple extended versions, with behind-the-scenes footage) for her latest The Life of a Showgirl single, “Opalite,” — has been showing her support for the Team USA in the 2026 Winter Games. Earlier in February, a video she filmed of herself wishing the Olympic athletes luck aired during NBC's opening ceremony.

The ""Pretty & Petty"" MC and the NFL star unfollowed each other after Diggs' New England Patriots were blown out in Super Bowl LX earlier this month.

Cardi B has not said much to date about her reported break-up with NFL wide receiver Stefon Diggs of the New England Patriots. But during one of her Little Miss Drama tour stops in Los Angeles on Sunday night (Feb. 15), the rapper seemed to open up about the couple's split, less than four months after Cardi gave birth to their son in November.

	“Just because I ain't f–ling with my baby daddy doesn't mean you get to talk about my baby daddy,” Cardi said during the show according to video of the comment. She then added a pointed, “this is for you b–ch,” before moving into her Am I the Drama? song “Pretty & Petty.” The diss track aimed at rapper BIA and came just days after BIA hopped online and appeared to take a swipe at Diggs, whose Patriots were blown out 29-13 by the Seattle Seahawks at Super Bowl LX earlier this month.

	“Can u name someone with more [baby mamas] than receiving yards,” BIA wrote on X on Thursday. “I can! and I know that… ykwnvm.” 


	Rumors that Cardi and Diggs had broken up after a year of dating —they reportedly began seeing each other in October 2024 and went official in June of last year — began to bubble up after the rapper was asked if she had a pre-game message for Diggs and she flatly replied, “Good luck” and then fans noticed that the two had unfollowed each other on Instagram. The speculation ramped up again after Cardi left the game early after her surprise cameo in Bad Bunny's historic halftime show.

	











BIA told Hot 97 last year that the origins of the two MC's issues stemmed from fans noticing that BIA's Really Her EP from 2023 and Cardi's “Enough (Miami)” track the following year had a similar groove. BIA dissed Cardi on her “Sue Me” track in 2024, with Cardi responding on “Pretty & Petty.”


	Cardi's tour will hit Portland's Moda Center on Thursday (Feb. 19).

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: All aboard! A Ticket to Ride movie is in development at Netflix, which has locked down exclusive global rights to Asmodee's popular railway-themed board game.


	This comes following their acquisition of similar rights to the publisher's other hit game, Catan.


Ben Mekler and Chris Amick are penning the feature, with Darren Kyman set to produce for Asmodee, alongside Eric Tannenbaum and Kim Tannenbaum for the Tannenbaum Company, and Jonathan Levine and Gillian Bohrer for Megamix. Alan R. Moon, author of the game, will executive produce on behalf of Asmodee.

	Mel McClelland, VP of the Tannenbaum Company, and McAuley Cahill, VP of Megamix, developed the feature concept from scratch alongside Mekler and Amick.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Netflix's deal for Ticket to Ride spans both scripted and unscripted arenas, and thus would also allow for projects in television and other formats. Should the film from Mekler and Amick make it to screens first, it'll be the first on-screen adaptation of the game.


	Becoming a pop culture staple since its 2004 launch, Ticket to Ride has sold over 20 million copies and been translated into more than 30 languages. The game has players collect colored train cards with an eye toward claiming railway routes connecting cities on a map — whether of the U.S., Europe, or what have you. The longer the route, the more points you score.


	“Just when I thought life couldn't get more exciting, Ticket to Ride is teaming up with Netflix,” said Moon. “I can't wait to help bring these exciting projects to the millions of fans of the game.”

	











	At Netflix, Ticket to Ride joins a growing portfolio of game-to-screen adaptations, including Arcane, Castlevania, Family Pack (The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow), Exploding Kittens, the upcoming Assassin's Creed series and Monopoly reality competition series, along with a new Gears of War film.


	The deal was negotiated by CAA and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman on behalf of Asmodee. Mekler and Amick are repped by Good Fear Content and CAA. Amick is also with Ziffren Brittenham.

Executive Editor, Television


Netflix is getting into the MMA world and is staging a fight between two of sports most successful female competitors.


	The streamer is launching a fight between Ronda Rousey and Gina Carano on May 16 at the Intuit Dome in LA.


	It marks Netflix's first-ever live MMA broadcast and comes at an interesting time. The streamer is currently in a battle to acquire to Warner Bros. Discovery against David Ellison's Paramount, which is the exclusive home to UFC in the U.S.


	Rousey was the first American woman to win an Olympic medal in judo before moving into mixed martial arts in 2011. She became the first female fighter signed by the UFC and was the sport's face before retiring in 2016 and moving into WWE.

	She has also starred in a number of movies and series including The Expendables 3 and Furious 7 as well as Entourage.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Carano started in Muay Thai before moving into MMA and becoming the face of the sport. She won seven matches before retiring after losing to Cris Cyborg.


	Carano then became a successful actor, starring as the lead in Haywire before roles in Deadpool and Fast & Furious 6. She is best known for her role as Cara Dune in two seasons of Disney+'s The Mandalorian. However, she was fired from the show in 2021 for social media posts that compared being a conservative in the U.S. to being Jewish under Nazi Germany. She subsequently filed a lawsuit against Disney for wrongful termination, which ended in a settlement, and later started working in projects by The Daily Wire.

	











	A fight between Rousey and Carano was always considered the biggest what-if in MMA; there was talk of a fight in 2014 but talks fell apart due to timing, weight-class considerations and the role of Dana White.


	The fight will be professionally sanctioned under the Unified Rules of MMA and contested over five, 5-minute rounds using 4oz gloves, inside a hexagon cage.


	It also marks the first MMA fight for Jake Paul's MVP, which has staged a number of boxing matches for Netflix including the fight between Paul and Mike Tyson.


	Tickets go on sale on March 5.


	“Been waiting so long to announce this: Me and Gina Carano are gonna throw down in the biggest super fight in women's combat sport history,” said Rousey. “And we're partnering with the fighter-first promotion MVP as well as the biggest and baddest streamer on the planet Netflix. This is for all MMA fans past, present and future.”


	“Ronda came to me and said there is only one person she would make a comeback for and it has been her dream to make this fight happen between us,” said Gina Carano. “She thanked me for opening up doors for her in her career and was respectful in asking for this fight to happen. This is an honor. I believe I will walk out of this fight with the win and I anticipate it will not come easy, which I welcome. This is as much for Ronda and me as it is for the fans and mixed martial arts community. What a time to be alive.”


	Gabe Spitzer, Netflix VP of Sports, added, “After the record-breaking success in boxing, we wanted our first MMA event to be truly legendary. We're thrilled to continue our partnership with MVP and bring together Ronda Rousey and Gina Carano to deliver the kind of high-stakes, icon-driven competition that our members crave. These are more than just athletes—they are generational stars—and having them headline our MMA debut at the Intuit Dome is a defining moment for us.”


	“MVP has always been driven by disruption and delivering the biggest moments in combat sports on a global scale, and today we are officially bringing that energy to MMA for the first time,” said Jake Paul and Nakisa Bidarian, co-founders of Most Valuable Promotions. “Ronda Rousey and Gina Carano are the two most formative figures in the history of women's MMA; they are the icons who shattered the glass ceiling and helped build the foundation this sport stands on.”

	As Paramount continued to lob offers for Warner Bros. Discovery that continued to be rejected, all at $30 a share in cash, the big question from Wall Street to Hollywood has been why not raise the bid.


	It seems that may happen as WBD said Tuesday that it is entering seven days of deal talks with the David Ellison-run company even as it continues to stand by its agreement with Netflix. Warner says that the Ellison camp had verbally agreed to boost its bid to $31 or higher if two the sides engaged, which WBD today has agreed to do.


	“On February 11th, a senior representative of your financial advisor communicated orally to a member of our Board that PSKY would agree to pay $31 per WBD share if we engage with you, and that $31 is not PSKY's best and final proposal,” WBD's board said in a letter to Paramount it released today.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	“We are writing to inform you that Netflix has agreed to provide WBD a waiver of certain terms of the Netflix merger agreement to permit us, through February 23, to engage with PSKY to clarify your proposal, which we understand will include a WBD per share price higher than $31. We seek your best and final proposal.


	“To be clear, our Board has not determined that your proposal is reasonably likely to result in a transaction that is superior to the Netflix merger. We continue to recommend and remain fully committed to our transaction with Netflix and have scheduled a special meeting of our shareholders on March 20, 2026 to vote on the Netflix merger agreement.”

	











	The Netflix deal is for $27.75 a share all in cash, a bid that it sweetened recently from a mix of cash and stock. Its deal is for Warner Bros. Studios and streaming assets, while linear television under Discovery Global is to be spun off into a separate public company.


	Paramount has launched an escalating series of hostile takeover offers for all of WBD. It's latest, on February 10, carried the same $30-a-share base price but also a handful of sweeteners and concessions that put pressure on Warner to take a closer look. A number of WBD shareholders were also pushing the David Zaslav-led company in that direction.


	Netflix has matching rights. 


	The giant streamer said today that, “While we are confident that our transaction provides superior value and certainty, we recognize the ongoing distraction for WBD stockholders and the broader entertainment industry caused by PSKY's antics.

Casey and his team has all the power here?

If they leave, there is no HBO.

Imagine if that group of senior development and production execs all left for amazon?

Immediately, they can build the new HBO.

The combined might of billions of dollars of WBD and Paramount debt, paired with piles of linear assets and news divisions no one wants to watch, will make them a true powerhouse of the 20th century.

As long as they turn CNN right wing, this will all be worth it for them.

After what happened yesterday yesterday with Colbert it's imprtant for quality viewing products to stop Paramoun from gaining Warner Bros. Censorship will only increase and the viewing public wiĺl forever suffer from a lack of qua,ity products.

its not censorship, you have to give equal time to political candidates. If he cant be balanced then don't reframe it to be a victim – we are sick of that play

The Equal Time Rule was killed by Reagan in the 80's. Where have you been?

Thats' all this theater is about is getting the stock up and over $30 and trying to do so before the shareholder meeting at the end of this month.  There are incentives for Zazzy and others for doing so and it also sets a new floor that the more mid-tier streamers can reference in their own M&A talks. I'm for WBD and Netflix and a return to physical media.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:deadline.com","Stephen Colbert Defies CBS, Says Network Banned Him From Interviewing James Talarico On ‘The Late Show'","https://deadline.com/2026/02/stephen-colbert-cbs-james-talarico-interview-1236726609/","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 07:05:00 GMT","


					By Tom Tapp 

Deputy Managing Editor


UPDATED: At the top of his monologue tonight, Stephen Colbert introduced the Late Show band, announced guest Jennifer Garner and then asked the audience, “You know who is not one of my guests tonight?”


	The CBS host then answered his own question.


	“That's Texas state representative James Talarico. He was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast. 


	“Then, I was told, in some uncertain terms, that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on. And because my network clearly does not want us to talk about this…Let's talk about this.”

	











	The Late Night host went on to explain FCC Chair Brendan Carr's new guidance on the “equal time” rule, which requires broadcasters who feature qualified political candidates on their airwaves provide time to rivals, if requested.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Deadline has reached out to CBS for comment and this post will be updated when it is received.


	Traditionally, news content has been exempted from the equal time rule and, in recent decades, stations have assumed that it has applied as well as to daytime and late-night talk shows, like The View and Jimmy Kimmel Live, which have featured presidential and other candidates, including figures like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.


	New FCC guidance, though, signaled to those talk shows that they no longer should believe that they would fall under the so-called “bonafide news” exemption. Carr said that a determination on whether a show is exempt would come down to a number of factors, including whether there was a “partisan motivation” in featuring a political candidate as a guest. “If you're fake news, you're not going to qualify for the bona fide news exemption,” said Carr.


	Colbert observed tonight, “It's no surprise that two of the people most affected by this threat are me and my friend Jimmy Kimmel.”

	











	Carr himself mentioned the duo in his recent comments, a clip of which Colbert played.


	“If Kimmel or Colbert want to continue to do their programming,” said Carr, “and they don't want to have to comply with this requirement, then they can go to a cable channel or a podcast or a streaming service and that's fine.” The equal time rule applies only to broadcast and not to other distribution, which are generally outside of the FCC's oversight.


	Colbert then said he was following Carr's advice and posting the entirety of his Talarico interview on YouTube. You can watch it below.


	Per Fox News, the FCC is investigating ABC News' The View for featuring Talarico as a guest earlier this month, after it issued the new guidance. The show did feature Talarico's main rival for the Democratic primary, Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX). Another Democrat, Ahmad Hassan, also is running for the nomination. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-TX) are challenging Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) in the GOP primary, but it is unclear if they would be entitled to equal time as well.


	Talarico posted the YouTube interview on X, writing, “This is the interview Donald Trump didn't want you to see. His FCC refused to air my interview with Stephen Colbert. Trump is worried we're about to flip Texas.” Per Colbert, the CBS lawyers ordered him not to air the interview, apparently out of concern over the FCC restrictions.


	During his Colbert interview, Talarico said, “This is the party that ran against cancel culture, and now they are trying to control what we watch, what we say, what we read. And this is the most dangerous kind of cancel culture, the kind that comes from the top. They went after The View because I went on there. They went after Jimmy Kimmel for telling a joke they didn't like. They went after you for telling the truth about Paramount's bribe to Donald Trump.”


	The sole Democrat on the FCC, Anna Gomez, has blasted Carr for his latest equal time guidance, saying it is an effort to pressure broadcasters and not even a “legitimate investigation.” She said of The View investigation, “The real purpose is to weaponize the FCC's regulatory authority to intimidate perceived critics of this Administration and chill protected speech. That is not how a free society operates.”


	Carr has acknowledged that the equal time rule also applies to radio, meaning that conservative talk shows that dominate many station airwaves also would face restrictions if they feature candidates.


	Broadcast talk shows have operated under the assumption that they are exempt from the rules since at least 2006, when Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R-CA) appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno as he was running for reelection. His Democratic challenger, Phil Angelides, sought equal time, but the FCC ruled that the late night show fell under the exemption.


	While the networks could challenge the FCC's latest guidance, given the agency's past history of not enforcing the equal time rule on talk shows, CBS parent Paramount made concessions to the FCC as part of its merger with Skydance last year. Among other things, it agreed to install an ombudsman “who will receive and evaluate any complaints of bias or other concerns involving CBS.” The person hired, Kenneth Weinstein, has his own ideological point of view, having formerly led the conservative think tank Hudson Institute.


	As they sought to close the Skydance transaction, Paramount's previous owners settled Trump's lawsuit against the CBS for $16 million. Trump sued them over the way that 60 Minutes edited an interview with Kamala Harris, in litigation that CBS attorneys had previously called baseless. 

	











	Paramount currently is seeking to purchase all of Warner Bros. Discovery. Even though that transaction will not come under FCC review, Paramount executive believe they have an easier regulatory review process with the Trump administration Justice Department than Netflix's deal with Warner Bros. for studio and streaming assets. Netflix has a deal in place with Warner Bros., but WBD on Monday announced that it is entering deal talks with Paramount following a sweetened offer.

the last paragraph about the proposed Paramount Warner Discovery purchase is vitally important and should ring alarm bells around the country.

Never bend the knee!!!

Part of Carr's statement is that they are determining what is and isn't “fake news”.

The company's lawyers made a decision based on the best interest of the company, just like hundreds of companies do every day. That's their job.

in response to abuse of power from the President which it sounds like you excuse

Late night comedy shows aren't news broadcasts and have always been free to interview any one they please. This is more control from our government that is becoming more authoritarian by the day.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Gwyneth Paltrow's daughter Apple Martin addresses rumors she was expelled for bullying","https://pagesix.com/2026/02/16/celebrity-news/gwyneth-paltrows-daughter-apple-martin-addresses-rumors-she-was-expelled-for-bullying/","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 02:17:00 GMT","

Apple Martin denied rampant social media rumors she was expelled from a school for bullying. 

“Hi! I didn't wanna respond but this narrative is completely false and has gotten so out of hand,” she wrote in a comment she then re-shared to Instagram Stories on Monday.

She went on to clarify that she's never been expelled from any school, especially for “bullying.”

“I completely understand ppl not liking me and that is okay! The internet is a place where ppl can share their opinions. But this rumor is completely untrue, I am not that type of person and anyone who is close to me knows that ❤️.”

The Vanderbilt University student, 21, wrote atop the screengrab, “just a quick little message from myself.” It's unclear where she originally shared the comment.  

The daughter of Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, 48, and Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow, 53, previously faced bullying rumors after video footage emerged of her seemingly attempting to crash a fellow debutant's impromptu photo shoot during Le Bal des Debutantes in Paris in December 2024.

She was also filmed seemingly rolling her eyes while entering the invite-only gala arm-in-arm with Count Leo Henckel von Donnersmarck.

But  Aliénor Loppin de Montmort — the young woman from the video — subsequently defended Apple. 

 “[Apple's] genuinely the nicest girl ever! She really doesn't deserve an ounce of what she's getting,” she told People in 2024. “She was the nicest girl ever towards not only me but all the debs!”

A source close to Paltrow told the Daily Mail at the time that, “Apple's more playful and fun and she's really a total girls' girl.”

They added that Apple “would never mean to take the spotlight from anyone, that was not her intention and insisted that to “characterize her as a mean girl is very untrue.” 

“She really had such a wonderful evening and I feel bad that this is even taking away from that because it was such an uplifting evening for her and the other girls,” they explained. 

Apple playfully addressed the accusations in a TikTok video with pals at the time.

“I don't know how anyone has a problem with us. We are such a delight,” the trio of friends acted out a pre-recorded voiceover. 

“We are two of the funniest girls and I know us, like offline,” one pal mouthed as the camera cut to an image of Ava Crox — who initially shared the video of Apple at her high society debut. 

“When I tell you, there aren't two more caring, charitable, generous, kind…” the video continued.

Din Djarin is back with some new little puppets and big CGI monsters. Disney shared a new trailer this morning for the upcoming Star Wars flick (not the one you may have seen in theaters ahead of Wuthering Heights this weekend) which sees the titular Mandalorian making his way through the gangsters, war criminals, and generally bad guys on his list. Of course, Grogu is also along for the ride, and this time even gets star billing in the title of the film. 

“This isn't about revenge,” says Ward (Sigourney Weaver). “It's about preventing another war.” Good luck with that—this is Disney's Star Wars. There will always be another war. But Din is most concerned about protecting Grogu, instructing him to check his armor and coping with some existential, very parental dread. “The kid will live centuries beyond me,” he says. “I won't always be around to protect him.” He's not the only one with this on his mind; we also get a glimpse of a fleeing baby Greedo, who probably isn't actually named Baby Greedo but is just a juvenile Rodian. 



Aside from Pedro Pascal as Din Djarin and Weaver, Jeremy Allen White will also star in The Mandalorian And Grogo as Ratta the Hutt. Jon Favreau directs. The Mandalorian And Grogu will open in movie theaters and IMAX on May 22.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the near-constant self-inflicted humiliation from CBS News in recent months, Anderson Cooper announced his departure from 60 Minutes earlier today (per Reuters). Cooper has been a correspondent for the once-storied, now-iffy news magazine show for nearly two decades, holding down dueling responsibilities between rival news organizations, CBS and CNN, since 2006. In a rather diplomatic statement that ignores the Bari Weiss-sized elephant in the room, Cooper claims he wants to spend more time with his family, which is easier than saying anything critical about CBS. “For nearly twenty years, I've been able to balance my jobs at CNN and CBS, but I have little kids now and I want to spend as much time with them as possible, while they still want to spend time,” Cooper said. Never fear, Cooper-heads. He can still be found on CNN, where he recently signed a new contract.

Cooper is the latest long-time staffer to jump ship from CBS since the network began hobbling its journalists and capitulating to President Trump. Since Trump returned to power and began tossing weak-sauce lawsuits at media outlets, which, in turn, paid him millions to go away, CBS has been hemorrhaging journalists. Bill Owens was the first to depart last April, followed soon after by CBS News chief executive Wendy McMahon. Later that year, CBS Evening News co-anchors John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois resigned amid Bari Weiss's punting of the 60 Minutes story about American concentration camps, “Inside CECOT,” claiming she was waiting for the White House's buy-in. But don't worry, they've been replaced by Tony Dokoupil, who loves America, salutes Marco Rubio, and probably hopes we'll stop making fun of Whiskey Fridays with Tony Dokoupil sometime this century. 

Ignoring the many fires burning down its house, CBS praised Cooper. “For more than two decades, Anderson Cooper has taken 60 Minutes viewers on journeys to faraway places, told us unforgettable stories, reported consequential investigations, and interviewed many prominent figures,” the network said. “We're grateful to him for dedicating so much of his life to this broadcast, and understand the importance of spending more time with family. 60 Minutes will be here if he ever wants to return.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","R.I.P. Frederick Wiseman, documentarian who observed human cost of institutional failure","https://www.avclub.com/frederick-wiseman-obituary-titicut-follies-welfare","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 02:07:00 GMT","

Frederick Wiseman has died. The documentary filmmaker best known for capturing people trapped in the grinding gears of corrupt institutions for more than half a century passed peacefully, his family announced today. He was 96. 

“For nearly six decades, Frederick Wiseman created an unparalleled body of work, a sweeping cinematic record of contemporary social institutions and ordinary human experience primarily in the United States and France,” Wiseman's production company, Zipporah Films, announced in a statement. “His films—from Titicut Follies (1967) to his most recent work, Menus-Plaisirs – Les Troisgros (2023)—are celebrated for their complexity, narrative power, and humanist gaze. He produced and directed all of his 45 films under the banner of Zipporah Films, Inc.”

Born in Boston, Massachusetts, on New Year's Day in 1930, Wiseman was the son of a lawyer, Jacob, who helped Jews escape from European nations engulfed by Nazism, and an aspiring actress named Gertude. Initially following in his father's footsteps, Wiseman attended Williams College and Yale Law School, graduating in 1954 before being drafted into the army. Upon returning to the United States, he took a job teaching law at Boston University's Institute of Law and Medicine. That's when he began to show his mother's influence as Wiseman made his first steps outside the court and classroom to produce Shirley Clarke's The Cool World, a fictional narrative drama that cast real Harlem kids and gang members. He followed it with his first documentary, Titicut Follies, in 1967. Shot over 29 days in Massachusetts's Bridgewater State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, Wiseman's camera observed staff abusing and degrading patients forced into inhumane living conditions. The film shocked the Massachusetts government, which accused Wiseman of breaking an “oral contract” that gave the state final cut and violating the patients' privacy and dignity. As a result, the film remained banned from public screenings until 1991. 



Titicut Follies set the standard for how Wiseman would make his “reality fictions,” as he called them, over the next 60 years. Unlike his contemporaries, Wiseman's films were free of narration, diegetic music, on-screen text, or talking-head interviews. In 1968's High School, Wiseman again spent approximately a month as a fly-on-the-wall, observing but never commenting directly on how those within the institution interacted. The action caught on film would be the story, but Wiseman quickly realized the key to his style was in the edit, where he could juxtapose moments for dramatic and comedic effect. He's never in the movie, but, as he told The A.V. Club in 2015, “I'm all over the movie, because I'm making all the choices that go into it.”

“It's a combination of luck and good judgment in different proportions in different times. And then knowing how to use it, and that's a function of your general experience. So much of these movies, particularly in the timing, have nothing to do with film,” Wiseman continued. “It has to do with deluding yourself into believing that you're understanding what you're seeing and hearing in the rushes[…]So I have to convince myself, whether correctly or not, that I understand not only a sequence, but all the sequences in order to make the judgment whether it's useful to me and how I want to edit it and what its relationship is to other sequences I've selected.”



With the backing of PBS and various grants, including a Guggenheim and a MacArthur Fellowship, Wiseman continued making films about the shortcomings of bureaucracies and institutions that, ostensibly, are designed to help people. Welfare, his 1975 documentary, showed the realities of the welfare system that traps people in the Sisyphean struggle of attempting to receive the bare minimum of government aid. But his boundless curiosity wasn't confined to governmental failures. His 1981 film, Model, shows the inner workings of a New York modeling agency, Zoli; in 1995, he directed Ballet about the American Ballet Theatre. He also directed several short films, including 2022's A Couple, which he made shortly after the death of Zipporah, his wife of 65 years. He continued making movies well into the 21st century, producing well-regarded documentaries, including In Jackson Heights and City Hall, before officially retiring after 2025. 

He is survived by his two sons with Zipporah, David and Eric, and three grandchildren.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Major Update in Nancy Guthrie Case as FBI Tracks Down ‘Weapon'","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/nancy-guthrie-fbi-suspects-gun/","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 02:06:12 GMT","

The Federal Bureau of Investigation is on the hunt for details on the gun seen holstered to the suspect in the images uncovered from Nancy Guthrie's doorbell camera. 

“FBI agents have been to several gun stores in Tucson with a list of forty people and their photos — looking to see if any of them were in the store or purchased a weapon,” reporter Brian Entin shared via X on Monday, February 16..

The search for Nancy Guthrie continues into its third week with major developments continuing to come in daily. 

Nearly two weeks after Guthrie's son-in-law, Tommaso Cioni, was accused of being “the prime suspect” in the case, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos announced that the entire Guthrie family had officially been cleared.

“To be clear…the Guthrie family – to include all siblings and spouses – has been cleared as possible suspects in this case. The family has been nothing but cooperative and gracious and are victims in this case,” the department shared via X. 

“To suggest otherwise is not only wrong, it is cruel. The Guthrie family are victims plain and simple…please, I'm begging you the media to honor your profession and report with some sense of compassion and professionalism,” the statement added.

After footage was uncovered from Guthrie's doorbell security camera showing a masked, armed man tampering with her camera, the FBI determined a suspect profile.

“The suspect is described as a male, approximately 5'9” – 5'10” tall, with an average build. In the video, he is wearing a black, 25-liter ‘Ozark Trail Hiker Pack' backpack,” the agency announced.

It was later revealed that investigators believe the ski mask, Ozark backpack, and clothing items worn by the unidentified man were purchased at Walmart.

According to CBS News, the black Ozark Trail Hiker backpack seen in the Nest camera footage is sold exclusively at Walmart. The outlet reported that investigators have obtained purchase records for that specific backpack, for both in-store and online transactions.

“Today” host and Nancy Guthrie's daughter, Savannah Guthrie, shared another public plea for her mom's kidnappers to come forward.

“It's been two weeks since our mom was taken, and I just wanted to come on and say that we still have hope,” she said in a video posted on Sunday, February 15. “I wanted to say to whoever has her or knows where she is that it's never too late…to do the right thing.”

Nancy Guthrie's $1 million and 3,776-square-foot home in Tucson, Arizona, has been owned by the beloved Guthrie matriarch since 1975, HELLO! reported. There, she raised her three kids, Camron, Annie and Savannah; watched them learn how to ride a bike; sent them off to their first days of school; and sat together for dinner as a family.

Although she has been missing for over two weeks, having been abducted from her Catalina Foothills residence in the early morning hours of Feb. 1, Nancy's family remains hopeful for her safe return, as they continue to keep her property maintained.

In a report from TMZ, the outlet shared that on Monday, Feb. 16, the Guthrie family hired a landscaper to upkeep Nancy's property, which sits on an acre of land located in a deserted terrain surrounded by cacti.

In video footage from a KNXV-TV journalist, a groundskeeper is seen walking her property after grabbing tools from an unmarked red truck. 

The landscaper brisked past a parked sheriff's car to get into Nancy's backyard as a reporter attempted to get a statement from him. 

Several days before this, the Guthrie family hired a pool service to maintain Nancy's pool on Feb. 13. According to TMZ, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told them that Ambiance Pool Service & Supplies was hired at the request of Nancy's loved ones.

Sheriff Nanos also reiterated that fact in a statement to media partners. “At the request of the Guthrie family, routine pool maintenance was conducted at the residence today,” the statement said, CNN reported.

In a “TODAY” show segment from November 2025, Nancy joined daughter Savannah, where they discussed the sacredness of the matriarch's Tucson home. 

“It's so wonderful. Just the air — the quality of life is laid back and gentle,” Nancy shared with Savannah after she was asked what made her want to stay in Tucson for the majority of her life.

During the search for the beloved 84-year-old, Savannah shared an emotional tribute to her mom on her Instagram. In the video, the NBC broadcaster stitched together several home videos from her childhood.

Savannah captioned the poignant video, expressing the hope she has for her mom's return home. “our lovely mom. 💛 we will never give up on her,” she wrote. “thank you for your prayers and hope ❤️.”

Robert Duvall, whose career spanned more than 70 years, died at 95. The Academy Award winner for 1983's “Tender Mercies” shaped American cinema with powerful performances in “The Godfather,” “Apocalypse Now,” “To Kill a Mockingbird,” and other landmark films widely regarded as classics of American cinema.

After news of his death broke, his “Godfather” co-stars began speaking out. They honored the actor whose presence helped anchor one of Hollywood's most iconic sagas.

Al Pacino remembered Duvall as a gifted performer and longtime colleague.

“It was an honor to have worked with Robert Duvall,” Pacino said, as reported by Variety. “He was a born actor, as they say, his connection with it, his understanding, and his phenomenal gift will always be remembered. I will miss him.”

Pacino starred alongside Duvall in “The Godfather” and “The Godfather: Part II.” Pacino played Michael Corleone, while Duvall portrayed Tom Hagen, the family's loyal attorney. Their performances helped define one of film's most celebrated sagas.

Robert De Niro also responded to the news with a short but heartfelt message in a statement to Variety. “God bless Bobby,” De Niro wrote. “I hope I can live till I'm 95. May he rest in peace.”

De Niro portrayed a young Vito Corleone in “The Godfather: Part II.” 

While he and Duvall did not appear together in scenes, both actors became essential to the film's lasting impact and its place in cinema history.

His wife, Luciana, confirmed his death on Monday, February 16, in a message shared on Facebook. 

“Yesterday, we said goodbye to my beloved husband, cherished friend, and one of the greatest actors of our time. Bob passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by love and comfort.”

She added, “To the world, he was an Academy Award-winning actor, a director, a storyteller. To me, he was simply everything. His passion for his craft was matched only by his deep love for characters, a great meal, and holding court. For each of his many roles, Bob gave everything to his characters and to the truth of the human spirit they represented. In doing so, he leaves something lasting and unforgettable to us all. Thank you for the years of support you showed Bob and for giving us this time and privacy to celebrate the memories he leaves behind.” Duvall is survived by his wife.

Oops, he did it again. Hallmark hunk Tyler Hynes was accused of “breaking the internet” yet again by fans who couldn't help but swoon over the vacation pics he posted on February 16, 2026. 

Likely instigating gasps heard 'round the world, from office cubicles to carpool lines, the “Three Wisest Men” star gifted his fandom — affectionately known as the Hynies — with a collection of tropical snapshots that started with him shirtless, walking along the beach as the sun set on the horizon. 

Hynes certainly deserved to start 2026 with a little R&R after a jam-packed fourth quarter that included two highly anticipated Hallmark movie premieres (“Three Wisest Men” and “Christmas Above the Clouds”), fan events across the U.S., and filming a special new movie expected to premiere this year (more on that later!). 

Based on the photos and videos Hynes shared, he returned to a tropical spot he'd been before, with the same location featured in a post from Earth Day 2025. One fan even noted, “Beautiful place😍. I can see why you make it your January home. Pura Vida🤙🤍😌”

Hynes' latest post showcased a relaxing time away where he was able to skateboard and surf in the sunshine, relax with a beer by the ocean, and take in the local culture. He even shared a video from a tiny Pura Vida plane, often used by tourists in Costa Rica, and monkeys playing in the trees. 

Fans flooded Hynes' vacation post with cute comments as they swooned, including one who quipped, “Ty breaking the internet on this Monday! 😍😂”

Someone else gushed, “Oh my the scenery is so Beautiful ❤️ but Tyler all I can say is your so 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️” and another wrote, “Stunning view of ocean and you!” 

The Tyler Hynes Shirtless Instagram account (yes, really!) commented, “Always appreciate the January content. ❤️🙌🔥”

Many also shared their gratitude with Hynes, noting that it was generous and kind of Hynes to share scenes from his vacation. One wrote, “Thank you for sharing and enjoy your time on the beach well deserved 🌊❤️❤️❤️”

Another chimed in, “You certainly know how to make the most out of your time spent off the grid. It is incredibly important to pause & take time for yourself, but I'm so glad you choose to share glimpses of your adventures with us. 🤍”

Some of Hynes' Hallmark pals weighed in, too. Kimberley Sustad declared that she's “coming next year” and Taylor Cole added, “😍 yes please 🙌”

Gay????

Maybe Gay????

No he is not gay.  He is straight and completely delicious. And he loves it when his fans swoon.   The energy fuels his self deprecating ego.

Tyler hynes is the most beautiful and wonderful and amazing man ever !!!

Gay, straight, whatever! He's not only handsome but a nice guy. Very personable at the Edison NJ Christmas Con. I told him he was taller than I thought. He was happy to hear that! LOL!

Let Reality Limit You'","https://www.indiewire.com/news/events/train-dreams-director-clint-bentley-lavazza-coffee-break-1235179865/","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 01:31:22 GMT","

The 41st Independent Spirit Awards were all about “Train Dreams.” Clint Bentley‘s sophomore directorial outing took home the Spirit Awards for Best Feature, Best Director, and Best Cinematography for Adolpho Veloso. It was a triumphant day for the independent film, which is heading into the Oscars with momentum a year after its Sundance debut. 

Before all the excitement began, Bentley took a Coffee Break with Lavazza. Prior to the ceremony, IndieWire and the beloved Italian coffee brand partnered to host intimate conversations with the filmmakers and performers behind some of our favorite films and shows.

 










Given the choice of Light Roast or Dark Roast questions, Bentley opted for a heftier Dark Roast and opened up about the challenges of shooting the film in the Washington wilderness.

“It was an independent film so we can go down the list,” Bentley said with a laugh when asked about the problems he encountered. “We were shooting on location in the US, in Washington state. You never have enough money, you never have enough time. But the whole crew believed in this so much and put their whole heart behind it.”

The incredible finished film isn't the only reason that the challenges were worth it. Bentley explained that the encouragement he received from his collaborators taught him to stop giving up on ideas before he had a chance to try them. It's a lesson that helped him fulfill his vision for “Train Dreams,” and one that he'll carry with him on future creative endeavors. 

 










“I learned to believe in myself. And I learned that through the people around me believing in me. To make this film was a jump from ‘Jockey,' and my producers, Joel [Edgerton], Adolpho, my production designer Alex Schaller, told me ‘Don't limit yourself. Let reality limit you, but don't start by limiting yourself.' That's a lesson I learned in this process, and I'd tell any filmmaker to learn it early rather than waiting like me.”

Hey, Pedro Pascal! There you are! We so rarely get to see the superstar in “The Mandalorian,” it's certainly nice to see his actual face in our first full look at its upcoming film sequel, “The Mandalorian and Grogu.” (Yes, don't worry, “Baby Yoda” is there, too.)

The new film sees Pascal reprise his eponymous role from the Disney+ series, with his adorable sidekick and charming ward Grogu, AKA “Baby Yoda,” now receiving top billing, too. Other cast members include Sigourney Weaver, Jonny Coyne, and Jeremy Allen White. (And, for keen-eared film freaks, is that Martin Scorsese we hear as a rattled merchant early in this new look?)

Here's the logline: “The evil Empire has fallen, and Imperial warlords remain scattered throughout the galaxy. As the fledgling New Republic works to protect everything the Rebellion fought for, they have enlisted the help of legendary Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) and his young apprentice Grogu.”

The trailer follows a relatively short (and oddly Budweiser commercial-coded) teaser from Super Bowl Sunday, and leans way into the star power of not just Pascal and his tiny little pal (real question: when is Grogu hitting a growth spurt?), but other friendly faces, from a tiny “Baby Greedo” to a cadre of brave Anzellans. In short: cute!

 










“The Mandalorian and Grogu” is directed by Jon Favreau. It's his first film behind the camera since 2019's remake of “The Lion King,” though Favreau has spent much of those seven years working on various “Star Wars” TV projects. He created both “The Mandalorian” and “The Book of Boba Fett,” served as an executive producer on “Ahsoka” and “Skeleton Crew,” as well as co-wrote the new film with Filoni, who also serves as an executive producer.

The film will be the first “Star Wars” joint to arrive in theaters after the recent departure of longtime Lucasfilm head Kathleen Kennedy and the first new film in the franchise to be released since 2019's “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.” The studio is also currently at work on “Starfighter” starring Ryan Gosling, which will open in 2027. Several other prospective films however with a revolving door of talent have started and stopped over recent years.

Disney will release “The Mandalorian and Grogu” in theaters on Friday, May 22. Check out the film's first full trailer below.

Following Gregg Araki's “I Want Your Sex” and Cathy Yan's “The Gallerist,” which both premiered at this year's Sundance Film Festival to mixed results, Geneviève Dulude-De Celles' “Nina Roza” is the latest 2026 film to take a swipe at the absurdities of the contemporary art world. Though instead of relying on the scandalous machinations of satire, as the Sundance titles did, this one pivots to and later works in service of the meditative allure of grief and memory drama.

Shot and set between Canada and Bulgaria, it's the follow-up to the Montreal-based director's first fiction feature, “A Colony,” which won the Crystal Bear in 2019. Like that film and the rest of her oeuvre, her latest is another tender tale of a protagonist stuck between two worlds, a hallmark motif fitting for a director who splits her time between documentary and fiction filmmaking.

The film's title reflects that “idea of the double,” featuring two women who seem enigmatically one and the same to the unmoored protagonist, art curator Mihail, played by Galin Stoev. One is an eight-year-old Bulgarian painting prodigy named Nina, alternately played by twins Sofia and Ekatarina Stanina; the other is Mihail's daughter Roza (Michelle Tzontchev) who's currently staying with him alongside her young son Thomas (Raphaël Fournier), after feeling adrift from the child's father. Through the stark similarities and differences between the two women, “Nina Roza” finds an apt symbolism for Mihail's past and present and search for belongingness, but it's unfair to suggest that Dulude-De Celles merely renders both women as a cipher for the protagonist and the viewer.

 










Mihail has kept both worlds firmly separate for nearly three decades since living in permanent exile in Montreal with Roza after the demise of his Bulgarian wife, so much so that he has become a Sofian who “thinks in French.” When Roza plays her mom's favorite music or insists on teaching her Quebec-born son to speak Bulgarian, it irritates him. The Balkan country is a “backward place,” he tells the curious boy. It's no surprise, then, that upon learning about the viral paintings of a rural Bulgarian village girl, who has repurposed a livestock barn into a studio, he almost instantly assumes it's a fraud. (Nina's trending story, which sets the movie into motion, takes its cue from the real-life story of Australian child prodigy Aelita Andre.) Soon, Mihail travels to Bulgaria to confirm his seemingly logical assumption, only to discover answers he didn't intend to seek and more questions about the double life he's leading and his fractured relationship with Roza, who was the same age as Nina when they fled Bulgaria together.

Though the legitimacy of Nina's abstract work (painted in real life by Montreal artist Aujeault) eventually snaps into focus, “Nina Roza” is much less drawn to solving the suspicion than to heightening the inescapable overlap between former and current lives, between dream and reality, in the context of grief and belated recollections, allowing for a hypnotic, plot-averse memory piece akin to many an Alice Rohrwacher movie. Other textures considered, Dulude-De Celles also fashions a film about exile and estrangement and sacrificing one's identity in pursuit of self-preservation, about what a place can do to people.

 










Whereas the film anonymizes its Canadian setting, given it's mostly presented through interior shots, cinematographer Alexandre Nour Desjardins shoots Bulgaria in a manner that feels at once poetic and purgatorial, and maximizes the scenic beauty of the countryside, with a camera that would rather move than keep still. The overall palette is subdued, steeped in vintage brown, which gives Dulude-De Celles' present-day story a timeless quality. Sun-drenched shots of Mihail, often zoned out or half-asleep in transit, evoke an elusive inner world the director is trying to access and intimate, in much the same way as the film's hazy moments, captured by an anamorphic lens, yield a transportive effect. There is a sense that the filmmaker is deliberately slowing down the central character's experience of the present and therefore that of the audience.

Then there's composer Joseph Marchand's meaningful mix of a generally dreamlike score, alongside ‘70s Bulgarian estrada, featuring Pasha Hristova's “Edna Bulgarska Roza” and “Povei Vetre,” and traditional Bulgarian folk music, like Petar Lyondev's widely popular arrangement of “Ergen Deda,” which is much less concerned with ennobling the proceedings than it is with reflecting Mihail's disassociation and forced contact with the specters of his past — one of the rare occasions where anachronistic needle drops actually elevate a film rather than kneecap it.

 










However, the film's critique of the art world only decidedly crystallizes when Chiara Caselli's Giulia, the Italian gallery owner representing Nina, shows up over an hour into the 104-minute movie. Recognizing that she can only play the prodigy card to sell Nina's work for so long, Giulia claims to give the child's mother an “excellent cause” to emigrate to Italy and practically forge a new life with her daughter in the foreign land. But when Mihail, feeling obliged to protect Nina, pries about the art dealer's real motives and whether she actually cares about the young artist's approval, Giulia merely couches her plan in terms of “helping them.” “Her mother came to me, not the other way around,” she asserts, pretending to be oblivious to the power dynamics between her and the women she claims to help.

The deceptively doting gallerist sees the girl as nothing but an investment, and all the predatory scheming is not lost on the precocious Nina, who'd rather prefer a pastoral life in the company of her friends and family, all artists themselves, to Italy's Next Great Painter, thus rejecting the solitary artist mystique. Nina sort of hurls the question of authenticity back to the foreign tastemakers hot on her heels. In this respect, “Nina Roza” can certainly be read as a commentary on tokenism, forced migration, and commodity in the modern art industry. A montage near the coda shows logistics workers carefully handling, labeling, and transporting Nina's paintings for the forthcoming exhibit thousands of miles away, and you begin to wonder whether gallerists, collectors, and curators value their artists the same way they value their works or the stories that brought forth such invaluable art. It's an adequate critique, one that I do wish the languidly paced movie foregrounded a little bit more.

 










Stoev and the Stanina twins (whom I hardly notice as two separate actors, let alone twins) are basically brilliant; they act as if it's not their first time sharing the screen together. Stoev's expressively melancholic visage recalls that of the recently late Iranian legend Homayoun Ershadi in “Taste of Cherry.” The movie is at its most potent when it simply observes Stoev interfacing with the local villagers, most especially the unassumingly funny Nikolay Mutafchiev, who plays Nina's uncle. Here and nowhere else, Mihail experiences the sacred bond of community, of what it means to primally connect with people, in hopes of learning to be gentle with oneself.

Like the eponymous gifted girl's paintings, “Nina Roza” is subtly cosmic, compelling, and impressionistic. It powerfully commits to symbolic, time-shifting flourishes scattered throughout its swerving narrative. It is a work of legitimate form.

“Nina Roza” premiered at the 2026 Berlin Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Lance Hammer was the toast of the town in 2008 with his hard-hitting, Mississippi-set coming-of-age drama “Ballast.” The Dardennes-esque vérité portrait of lives careening from loss and economic hardship won two awards at the Sundance Film Festival that year — including Best Director for Hammer — and received multiple Film Independent Spirit and Gotham award nominations. 

And then, poof: Hammer was never heard from again.

He has now returned, almost two decades later, with an extremely upsetting but compassionate moral drama about agency amid dementia, titled “Queen at Sea.” It stars Juliette Binoche as a woman desperate and panicked to take care of her ailing mother, Leslie (Anna Calder-Marshall), who is slipping deeper into the illness. Leslie's grasp of time, memory, and function is vanishing in the multi-story London flat she shares with her husband of 19 years, Martin (a brutally heartbreaking Tom Courtenay). Meanwhile, Amanda (Binoche), an academic, is going through a separation herself — from her husband in Newcastle, and now she's forced to bring her daughter, Sara (Florence Hunt), with her back to London to check in on and care for her mother.

But when Amanda catches her stepfather, Martin, in a compromising position with Leslie, another separation sets into motion, with Leslie potentially about to be lost in an elder-care system that's frightening and scary for the patient, and all but a death sentence for her and her loved ones.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






As someone who's watched a close loved one lose themselves to Alzheimer's disease, I found “Queen at Sea” to be especially bruising, even despite some of its patchier plot notes. The emotions are there, even if the story is, well, lost at sea at times. The geographical configuration surrounding Amanda, having left behind a husband (and Sara's father) in Newcastle, is confusing. Meanwhile, Sara has very quickly restarted her life in Newcastle with new friends and a potential new flame, as writer/director Hammer draws parallel comparisons in the edit between Sara's blooming relationship with a classmate, and Leslie's mental deterioration and estrangement from her own partner.

When the movie begins, Amanda is on a house call to check on Leslie, and walks in on Martin attempting to have sex with a dazed-out, addled-eyed Leslie prostrate on the bed. This is not the first time this has happened, and it's an occurrence Amanda has implored Martin to knock off. But the Viagra in his medicine cabinet suggests otherwise, that he keeps going back for more, that Amanda keeps asking him to stop.

Dementia dramas like Sarah Polley's wounding “Away from Her” (wherein Julie Christie's husband Grant Anderson basically sets her up in a nursing home to counteract his own infidelities) and Michael Haneke's Oscar-winning “Amour” (the harshest of this fleet of films) tend to center close-up on the relations between an Alzheimer's patient and her partner, and how these relationships break down when there are fewer past and present memories to found them on. 

 










Hammer's film introduces profound new questions and issues about consent into the formula — is Leslie agreeing on some level to have sex with her husband? Is the only pleasure in her winnowing life to be denied? Can a person with dementia consent to having sex? Leslie's instincts now are narrowed to the primal: food, water, sleep, and, naturally, sex. So where do all these leftover feelings go when the body containing them is now only a vessel for a going mind?

Martin insists that Leslie — a once-celebrated and very talented painter now slowly going mute, mentally and emotionally and physically — is enjoying these encounters. They've been married for 19 years, after all, and when Amanda calls the police and introduces authorities into the situation, the couple is suddenly torn asunder. Then arise questions about whether they should continue to be separated and whether to place Leslie in a home.

Which is eventually what happens, and where Leslie forms an inappropriate bond with another patient to fill the Martin void. Writer/director Hammer, though, downplays the melodrama inherent to this scenario, even while shooting sequences, whether in Martin and Leslie's apartment or in various hospitals, with a bracing handheld intimacy. Far from sterilely composed, a rape kit examination forced upon Leslie is harrowing and demeaning, especially as she has no idea what's going on and no clue why a speculum is being inserted into her. In what world could Martin have raped his wife?

 










Binoche, who has been giving committed and emotionally messy but always focused performances for years lately, including in films by Haneke, gives one of her best recent turns in “Queen at Sea.” An emotional phone call to her soon-to-be ex-husband shows blanched vulnerability as she dials the last person she would prefer not to call, but the one she is forced to call anyway. Interior lives outside those determined by this situation may be lacking, but Leslie's isn't. Amanda's mother seems to activate when given the chance to paint at a nursing home, an aseptic and terrible place for which everyone in the family seems to be awkwardly auditioning.

The great British actor Courtenay, most recently memorable in the similarly memory-impaired marriage portrait “45 Years” opposite Charlotte Rampling, is quite devastating as a husband scrambling for answers and to legitimize his own place in Leslie's life. The one element that doesn't quite land, and seems quite literally chopped into the film, is Florence Hunt as Amanda's daughter. Hammer seems to be trying to signal that she may be headed for her own future mental ruin by intercutting her first romance with scenes of Martin and Leslie's last. It's a noble idea, but it ends up feeling like scraps from an earlier draft.

Ultimately, though, anyone who's endured what Amanda, or Leslie, or Martin do in this movie will find something to relate to and feel toward. Hammer spares no hard truths and offers no pat feelings with regard to how these people are bound to end up and what dementia ultimately does to them. Let's just say hope is at a shortage. But the actors help carry Hammer's message — and make it unforgettable.

A few years ago, agents Pete Franciosa and Mike Rubi got a call looking to see if a Hollywood production designer was available for a job in Ohio. A retiree was looking to transform his entire, 2,000 square foot basement into a replica of the interior of the Death Star, and he wanted a real professional to help do it.

Perhaps incredibly, Franciosa and Rubi did not immediately hang up the phone.

Franciosa and Rubi are the heads of United Talent Agency's Production Arts division, where they've been in charge since 2013. The division at UTA is responsible for repping top crafts talent, including cinematographer Roger Deakins, “Dune” production designer Patrice Vermette, “The Smashing Machine” makeup designer Kazu Hiro, “Andor” costume designer Michael Wilkinson, and many, many more. Like any agent, they negotiate film and TV jobs for their talent. But it's also been the duo's philosophy to look outside the box, away from Hollywood and into other realms that aren't exclusively for entertainment.

So when a job offer like the Ohio Death Star comes their way, they listen. That one didn't pan out, and they didn't disclose whom would've been the lucky Oscar winner to travel to some guy's basement in the Midwest. But it's just one of many opportunities that Franciosa and Rubi are fielding for their clients beyond work that could win them Oscars.

“God, that would have been a magical project,” Franciosa told IndieWire. “It was smart, film-based, and deeply meaningful — both to the designer and to the client who wanted it built. I love ideas like that. And frankly, I hope more of them keep coming. It's imaginative, it's personal, and it's exactly the kind of creative challenge our clients thrive on.”

Rubi is quick to chime in that for every one of those wacky ideas, there are 10 more that are far more practical, like building a New York City backlot set for a film studio in Sri Lanka. It's different, but not completely far afield. He explains that there's the pragmatic aspect of keeping a client employed in between movies, but there's also the perk of giving acclaimed artists the chance to stretch their art and reputation further around the globe. 

“These are sophisticated, high-level business leaders in their own right,” Rubi said. “When they come to us, it's because they have the ability to work with anyone in the world — and they choose our clients because they have a genuine affinity for the artistry and craftsmanship these designers bring. There's real respect for the work.”

In some cases, Production Arts' vision has been to elevate its clients to the next level. Jeremy Hindle, an Emmy-winning production designer on “Severance” during its first season, graduated to being a producer on the second season of the Apple TV series. Others have become directors or gone from indies to studio films and series. 

 










But in other cases, Production Arts has managed to leverage its connections to UTA's other divisions to find them opportunities. Deakins recently parlayed his visual acumen into a book called “Reflections.” One producer client of UTA's is in the midst of launching a podcast based on stories from the world of movie making. And Vermette is in the midst of designing a hotel resort with a company called Mohari Hospitality. 

For Vermette, this is actually the second hotel he's now designing. The first was a collaboration in Saudi Arabia with a French Moroccan architect, one he completed in between “Dune: Part 2” and the upcoming third “Dune” film, and this new one, the location of which he's not yet able to disclose, he took on after the third “Dune” wrapped. 

Vermette told IndieWire that though he wants to “die on a movie set,” he loves being able to tell stories in any setting, and he'd love to expand his craft to help design industrial spaces, to work on cars, furniture, or even do something in the live space after he was inspired by Bad Bunny's Super Bowl Halftime performance. 

“I'm a passionate person, and I'm curious, and I thrive for a different experience,” Vermette said. “I think one hopefully will feed the other. My film experience, it will feed, whether it's hospitality or an event, and then what I'll learn by the collaborations I have on these projects, that will feed me for the film.” 

 










After working with a number of legendary cinematographers, he's learned the importance of light to a physical space, even a hotel. For instance, he's designing the hotel's corridor such that when the light hits the space at different times of day, it gives a new experience each time you pass through it.

“For production designers, we use our instincts and our eyes in our work in film,” Vermette said. “I think that could be beneficial for other fields as well. Everybody could benefit from being more flexible.” 

For some artists, finding other opportunities may be a matter of necessity. Los Angeles ended 2025 with 16 percent fewer shoot days than in 2024, according to the most recent numbers from FilmLA. Back in 2024, we spoke with below the line workers who don't have the name recognition of some of UTA's top clients, and they found themselves installing light fixtures in conference rooms or Jumbotrons in college arenas. 

These odd jobs aren't a replacement for the real thing in the absence of local film productions, but they keep clients busy and help elevate their reputation in other ways. Franciosa said when it comes to “below the line” professionals, just by their name, they are inherently undervalued artists in the industry. The idea of Production Arts is that for their clients, none of them are “below” anything.

 










“Artists are artists — they don't live in a singular box. They break walls and ceilings. Andy Warhol is a great example: he didn't think in limiting creative terms, and there was no ceiling on what he could do,” Franciosa said. “That's the spirit behind this division. You may be a cinematographer, a production designer, or a costume designer, but your specialty shouldn't define the limits of your creativity. We represent artists in a way that allows them to do their most creative work, regardless of category. If their imagination has no limits, their opportunities shouldn't either.”

“Every artist is different. The cachet they hold within the creative community takes a different form in each case,” Rubi added. “But the through line is this — every time someone successfully expands into a new arena, it strengthens the broader effort and creates momentum. Each success opens the door to the next opportunity.”

After much teasing last week, Willow has released a new album. Petal Rock Black is her seventh studio LP and it's out now via Three Six Zero. She wrote, performed, and produced the record, enlisting guests George Clinton, Kamasi Washington, and Tune-Yards for good measure. Give it a listen below.

In a press release, Willow describes Petal Rock Black as “a personal offering that honors the labor of creation: of self, of sound, of community. It's a celebration of life, of artistic dedication, and of all those who use their hands to shift culture toward something more beautiful.” It follows her 2024 album Empathogen.

In a video teaser, Willow revealed that she plays guitar, piano, and drums on Petal Rock Black, and that it took over 18 months of work in the studio to complete the album. “I have no doubt we need that kind of pressurized experience in order to touch new places inside of ourselves—no matter how much the fear of failure or the unknown might haunt us, we come back to ourselves again,” she says in the clip.

If metal has always been inherently camp, then few strains are as attuned to it as symphonic black metal. I mean, if you're building a haunted house, why not go all out on the decorations? Light a candelabra, put on some face paint, hire that creepy choir—or at least rent a keyboard to sound like one. Crystallizing in the early '90s at a time when American death metal was leaning into gory extremity (and the Norwegians were just actually killing people), the style offered a whimsical counterbalance to all the shock and horror. Here was music that pushed the genre back to the realm of ghosts and ghouls, the ideal soundtrack for doing battle with Dracula on the spiral staircase of his manor. There's a delectable tension between its chintziness and its opulence, forcing the mind to color in the spaces of its grand visages.

Perhaps that sense of scenery is why it's proven so irresistible to Worm. While the Florida project has always had a malleable aesthetic, the constants have been a love of gloomy atmospherics and a penchant for crafting decrepit worlds out of their swampy death-doom. Initially the solo project of one Phantom Slaughter, Worm has massively shifted gears since 2022 when they were joined up by Wroth Septentrion. Wroth's resume includes a smattering of boundary-pushing projects, from the alien tech-death of Chthe'ilist to the ornate funeral doom of Atramentus, and along with Phantom Slaughter, he's rebuilt Worm anew as a shrieking symphonic black metal act. After dipping their toes in with a handful of EPs, Necropalace launches this new direction in earnest, leveling up to a bigger label with Century Media and presenting the band's most extravagant, vampiric suite yet.

Though Worm may have access to more realistic sounding keyboard orchestras than the ones Cradle of Filth and Emperor were trotting out back in the day, they purposefully delight in this subgenre's artificiality. “Halls of Weeping” prefaces its sludgy march with cheeky choirs that glow like a row of pumpkins, while “The Night Has Fangs” culminates in a dueling bridge of harpsichord and guitar locked into a soaring spiral. The band has never sounded this melodic before; Wroth in particular brings a constant dynamism to his guitar solos, often layering two and reaching climaxes that refuse to collapse into just a flurry of notes, building off Phantom Slaughter's keyboard melodies with a real sense of drama. He's not alone either, with none other than former Megadeth guitarist Marty Friedman joining on “Witchmoon: The Infernal Masquerade” to trade leads between church organ licks over a craven 14 minutes.

Yes, this is indulgent, proggy metal—the songs average around 10 minutes apiece—but at times it feels like Worm could have pushed their sound even further. Though the band avoids settling into cycling black metal block chords, their riffs can't totally escape seeming more and more repetetive as they chug along. There are a few colorful scene-setting details, particularly on the title track, which finds room for both an Opeth-y acoustic bridge as well as some sabre-clashing sounds straight out of “The Gates of Delirium.” However, besides “Blackheart,” which mixes things up with its Tiamat-like gothic stomp and cheesy adult-contemporary synths, these tracks largely follow the galloping template set forth by the band's newly chosen genre. It's a fun formula, but a formula nonetheless.

The current incarnation of Worm have proven that they're as capable as anybody of carrying the torch of Dimmu Borgir, Obsidian Gate, and all the other blackened bedroom Beethovens out there. Though they offer just enough wrinkles to this subgenre to make it their own (including a more mid-range, teeth-gnashing vocal style, and almost power-metal levels of guitar decadence), these songs tend to have about twice as many bridges as Worm's ideas can support and not enough moments that leap out as opposed to just keeping their spooky carousel spinning. The band's strengths have always lied less in their songwriting and more in the colorful landscapes they conjure, even if they do make some valiant attempts here to flesh out their compositional chops. It's a fresh, theatrical style, but it still feels like a costume they're getting used to.

Donald Trump has once again made the death of an American public figure about himself. In response to the news that Reverend Jesse Jackson died on Tuesday, the president hopped onto Truth Social to remind everyone that he can't be racist, because he was very nice to the famed Black activist. 


	“I knew him well, long before becoming President. He was a good man, with lots of personality, grit, and ‘street smarts,'” Trump wrote. “Despite the fact that I am falsely and consistently called a Racist by the Scoundrels and Lunatics on the Radical Left, Democrats ALL, it was always my pleasure to help Jesse along the way.” 


	Trump went on to highlight that he had provided office space for Jackson's civil rights nonprofit Rainbow/PUSH at Trump Tower in New York City, and “responded to his request for help in getting CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM passed and signed, when no other President would even try.” 


	The president went on to accuse former President Barack Obama, the only Black president in American history, of showing insufficient gratitude towards Jackson. “He had much to do with the Election, without acknowledgement or credit, of Barack Hussein Obama, a man who Jesse could not stand.” 

	











	“He loved his family greatly, and to them I send my deepest sympathies and condolences. Jesse will be missed,” Trump tacked on at the end of the lengthy post. 


	It's not the first time Trump has made the death of a prominent figure about himself. In December, for example, Trump mocked director Rob Reiner as having been killed over his “Trump Derangement Syndrome” shortly after Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer, were found stabbed to death in their Los Angeles home.

	“He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.

	











	Jackson bashed Trump on several occasions since Trump first became president a decade ago. He described Trump in 2018, for example, as a “man of inherited wealth and privilege who seems to have no understanding of our situation.”

	Jon Blistein



	Rev. Jesse Jackson, the towering civil rights activist and religious leader who worked to improve economic conditions for Black communities and advocated for social-justice causes around the world, died on Tuesday. He was 84.


	Jackson's death was confirmed by his family, who said in a statement that he “died peacefully” while surrounded by family. “Our father was a servant leader — not only to our family, but to the oppressed, the voiceless, and the overlooked around the world,” the family's statement continued. “We shared him with the world, and in return, the world became part of our extended family. His unwavering belief in justice, equality, and love uplifted millions, and we ask you to honor his memory by continuing the fight for the values he lived by.” A cause of death was not immediately available.


	In November 2025, Jackson was hospitalized in Chicago where he was put under observation for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a neurological disorder that can affect body movements and balance. PSP is similar to Parkinson's, which Jackson was originally diagnosed with in 2013. His PSP diagnosis was confirmed in April 2025.

	











	For more than 50 years, Jackson was one of the most prominent activists in the United States. He got his start in the Sixties, working closely with Martin Luther King Jr., before founding two advocacy groups, Operation PUSH (People United to Serve Humanity) and the National Rainbow Coalition. (These two were later consolidated into the Rainbow PUSH Coalition.)

	











	His opposition to Ronald Reagan led him to launch two presidential campaigns, in 1984 and 1988. Though both fell short, Jackson registered millions of new voters and significantly overperformed expectations, finishing third in 1984 (behind Gary Hart and Walter Mondale) and second in 1988 (behind Michael Dukakis). For a brief moment in 1988, he even took the delegate lead over Dukakis after a massive win in the Michigan caucus. 


	As the most prominent and successful Black candidate for president at that time, Jackson helped set the stage for the election of Barack Obama 20 years later. But it was also reforms he advocated for in 1988, which changed how delegates were distributed during the Democratic primary, that made Obama's victory possible, too. And Jackson's campaigns, with their unabashedly progressive platforms, set a mold that future longshot, outsider candidates on the left, like Bernie Sanders, would follow for decades to come.

	“The issues that we raised were resonating,” Jackson recently recalled in Abby Phillip's book A Dream Deferred: Jesse Jackson and the Fight for Black Political Power. “Our issues were on time, issues about economic justice and shared economic security, a connection between family farms and urban workers, how Blacks and whites had to relate together, and browns. So, it was in full gear. We used to call it ‘poor campaign, rich message.' Our message was winning.”


	Born Jesse Burns on Oct. 8, 1941, in Greenville, South Carolina, Jackson was the son of a high school student, Helen Burns, and her 33-year-old neighbor, Noah Robinson. Helen eventually married Charles Henry Jackson, who adopted Jesse and gave his stepson his last name. (Jackson learned the identity of his biological father at a young age and maintained a relationship with him throughout his life.) Of growing up in the Jim Crow South, Jackson told The New York Times in 1987, “I remember being taught my place.”


	He attended segregated schools and sat at the back of the bus until the Montgomery bus boycotts of 1955 (Jackson was 14 at the time). A good student and a standout athlete, Jackson earned a scholarship to play football at the University of Illinois, but left the predominately white school after one year. He transferred to the historically Black North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College, where he continued to play football, but also became involved in the civil rights movement. He then attended the Chicago Theological Seminary, but dropped out before graduating to work for King. (He was ordained at a Chicago church in 1968 and was awarded his Master of Divinity degree in 2000.)

	King appointed Jackson to run Operation Breadbasket under the banner of his Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). As head of the first Chicago chapter, and then the national organization, Jackson focused on encouraging people to patronize Black-owned businesses and organized pickets and boycotts of businesses that refused to hire Black people. 


	Jackson's confident, independent streak eventually generated friction with other top lieutenants in the SCLC, as well as King himself. Jackson was present at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis when King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. He would claim that he was the last person to speak to King before he died and held him in his arms after he was shot. (The next day, he went on TV wearing the same blood-stained turtleneck.) Others in the SCLC disputed Jackson's version of events (he was a floor below King at the motel, for instance), leading to further tensions. 


	In 1971, Jackson left the SCLC to found Operation PUSH (the “S” originally stood for “save” before being changed to “serve”). PUSH continued much of the economic-driven work Jackson was doing for Operation Breadbasket, including boycotts of Anheuser-Busch and Coca-Cola in the 1980s. The group's efforts to bolster education in Black and underprivileged communities earned them federal assistance from the Jimmy Carter administration. But while Jackson's profile grew, PUSH frequently faced criticism for poor management and follow-through. Jackson frequently responded to such criticism with the line “I'm a tree-shaker, not a jam-maker.” 


	When Jackson announced his first campaign for president in November 1983, he was still a polarizing figure and failed to pick up endorsements from prominent Black leaders like Coretta Scott King and Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young. He also faced allegations of anti-Semitism related to his support for a Palestinian state, refusal to disavow Louis Farrakhan, and for referring to Jews as “Hymies” and New York City as “Hymietown” while speaking with a Washington Post reporter. (Jackson denied the allegation.) 


	Jackson's showing in the first two 1984 primary contests, in Iowa and New Hampshire, were poor in these predominately white states. But he did exceptionally well in the next contests in the South, especially among Black voters. Jackson's momentum grew, and he went on to win more than 3 million votes nationally in the 1984 primary. His voter-registration efforts also brought scores of new Black voters to the polls, which proved critical in the Democrats winning the Senate in 1986. 

	











	Speaking at the Democratic National Convention, Jackson spoke about the importance of building a diverse, multiethnic “rainbow coalition” (and even gave his new social-justice and political-empowerment organization the same name, the National Rainbow Coalition). “We are often reminded that we live in a great nation — and we do,” he said during his speech. “But it can be greater still. The Rainbow is mandating a new definition of greatness. We must not measure greatness from the mansion down, but the manger up.”


	Four years later, Jackson significantly expanded his own coalition. He won nearly 30 percent of the popular vote during the primaries while running on a platform that included reversing Reagan-era tax cuts, increasing federal spending for social programs, and implementing single-payer universal healthcare. 


	Despite falling short in 1988, Jackson's second strong showing established him as a prominent figure in Democratic politics. During the Nineties, he was elected to be the shadow senator for Washington, D.C. (a kind of lobbying/advocacy role, focused mainly on D.C. statehood), while President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeline Albright appointed him Secretary of State for the Promotion of Democracy in Africa. Clinton later awarded Jackson with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. 


	Jackson's stature even allowed him to serve as an ad-hoc diplomat. In the Eighties, he helped secure the release of a captured Navy lieutenant in Syria, as well as 48 Cuban and Cuban American prisoners in Cuba. He went on to bring home citizens being held as “human shields” by Saddam Hussein in Kuwait, negotiate the release of U.S. soldiers being held hostage in Kosovo, and the release of British journalists being held in Liberia. 


	While Jackson chose not to run for office again, his son, Jesse Jackson Jr. was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served from 1995 to 2012. The elder Jackson instead focused on his activist work, merging his two groups into the Rainbow PUSH Coalition and advocating on issues both domestic (health care, gun control, the War on Drugs) and international (ending apartheid in South Africa, pushing for democracy in Haiti, negotiating peace between Israel and Palestine, and speaking out against the Iraq War). 


	In 2007, Jackson became one of the earliest backers of Obama's presidential bid, and his son served as a co-chairman on the future president's campaign. But some friction emerged between the rising political star and his predecessor when Jackson was caught on a hot mic criticizing an Obama Father's Day speech. (“I want to cut his nuts out,” Jackson said. “Barack, he is talking down to Black people.”) Jackson did apologize, Obama accepted, and Jackson was famously caught on camera weeping after Obama's victory in November 2008. 

	











	Describing the emotions he felt that night, Jackson told NPR, “Well, on the one hand, I saw President Barack Obama standing there looking so majestic. And I knew that people in the villages of Kenya and Haiti, and mansions and palaces in Europe and China, were all watching this young African American male assume the leadership to take our nation out of a pit to a higher place. And then, I thought of who was not there … the martyrs and murdered whose blood made last night possible. I could not help think that this was their night.”


	Jackson remained a major figurehead in the final decades of his life, while also settling into an elder-statesman role. Though not directly involved with Black Lives Matter — and sometimes seen as out of step by the movement's young leaders — he gave his support to protesters and often stood alongside the families of Black people killed by the police. In 2021, as he was pushing 80 years old, Jackson was arrested twice within a few months during protests related to ending the Senate filibuster and challenges to the Voting Rights Act. 


	In 2023, Jackson announced his plans to step down as head of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition amid his advancing age and growing health concerns. Still, he continued to make public appearances, including the 2024 Democratic National Convention, and speak out on issues that mattered most to him.

	Speaking to The New York Times in 1987, Jackson talked about how he wanted to be seen, especially by the Black community, saying he wanted to be “someone who can sit on television and argue their case.” 


	“Dr. King, he could argue their case. That was the whole thing with [trailblazing Congressman] Adam [Clayton Powell]. He could walk in the Congress or go in that White House and tell them. Or Moses. If Moses tells them let the people go, they'll let them go. So leaders, over time, they become a force in people's lives to which they look. It's like you're speaking, and people say, ‘Amen.'”

				Weir at home in California in 1998			








							By 

	David Browne




A
t a recording studio in Woodstock, New York, Bob Weir was in the midst of making Blue Mountain, a 2016 collection of newfangled cowboy ballads that spoke to one of the Grateful Dead singer-guitarist's passions, when he paused between takes. Turning to one of the studio's employees, he said, “I need you to go to the hardware store. We're going to need a 10 — make it a 15 — pound sledgehammer.” 


	Producer Josh Kaufman had dealt with plenty of requests from musicians in the past, but nothing quite like this. “We're all like, ‘What the fuck is going on?'” he recalls. Everyone learned soon enough when the tool arrived. Stepping outside, Weir — in white yoga pants and a blue tank top, his hair and bushy beard pepper-gray — began carefully swinging the sledgehammer around his head and behind his back. As he told the crew gathered around to watch, that move was one of the oldest exercises known to man, and helped relieve lingering shoulder pain. “He had all these different moves he had memorized,” Kaufman says. “He seemed pretty in control. He had good balance.” 

	











	 Everybody, it seems, has their Bob Weir exercise stories. On tour with Bobby Weir and Wolf Bros, a late-period side project, Don Was took a shot at the resistance ropes Weir would hook up to a tree on the side of a road. “He got too good for me,” says Was, the well-known producer who served as the band's bassist. “I couldn't keep up with him.” Footage of Weir training, released with his approval, became must-see memes. But Weir's transformation into a late-in-life fitness guru, the Jack LaLanne of the counterculture, was more than a sight gag: It was a sign Weir was pushing hard, often physically, to come back from a devastating loss that almost derailed him.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	For the first 30 years of his life in the Dead, Weir inhabited different roles. He was the youngest member of the original lineup, the voice behind some of the Dead's friskiest songs (from “Sugar Magnolia” and “Truckin'” to “Estimated Prophet” and “Hell in a Bucket”), the prankster who got the Dead banned from a major airline by flashing a cap pistol and dropped a water balloon on a cop. Even with his unorthodox style of guitar, which blended lead and rhythm, Weir was the glue that helped keep the band together. “We tried to kick him out at one point, but it didn't stick,” says drummer Bill Kreutzmann, referring to a contentious 1968 band meeting. “He just wasn't having it. Instead, he knew that if he was going to last, he'd have to figure out a way to play guitar that complemented instead of competed with Jerry [Garcia]. And since Phil [Lesh] didn't play bass like it was glued to the rhythm section, Bob found some room there and wedged himself into the spaces in between. That's why he played guitar unlike anyone else.”

	From his early ponytail to his later hot pants, Weir was also the Dead's resident Haight dreamboat. As Dead historian, author, and former band publicist Dennis McNally notes, “You have to have one good-looking guy in a band.”


	But by the time Weir died — on Jan. 10, at 78, from “underlying lung issues” following a battle with cancer (according to his family) — he had taken on an even greater and more unexpected role. When Dead & Company kicked off in 2015, Weir was no longer the skinny teenager trying to keep up with Garcia and Lesh, nor the frequent butt of band ribbing for his space-cadet side. “He was the custodian of the most important American rock band, and he just held it so beautifully,” says Aaron Dessner of the National, who recorded and toured with Weir about a decade ago. “And it wasn't an act. He was the living, breathing personification of it.”


	Onstage with Weir in Wolf Bros, Was witnessed Weir's bond with Deadheads on a regular basis. “They fucking loved him, man,” he says. “You could see how much they appreciated all the experiences they'd had ancillary to this music. We used to do ‘Ripple' as an encore every few shows, and he knew what that song meant to them and gave it his all every time. He was aware of the responsibility he had and was honored to tackle it.”

	But for Weir to arrive at that point was neither effortless, nor a given. Following the death of one of rock's most recognizable icons and his charismatic mentor, Weir had an elevated role thrust upon him — one he continually grappled with and had to evolve into, whether he wanted to or not. As Deadheads witnessed for themselves over the course of some difficult years, Weir went through his own variation of the five stages of grief, from a form of denial through a degree of acceptance (with a new physical regimen to accompany it). To use the title of one of the later songs he co-wrote for the Dead, life after Garcia had no easy answers, and posed plenty of hard questions.

	











	Weir's tour bus had just arrived at the Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom in Hampton Beach, New Hampshire, when the news started to spread: That day, Aug. 9, 1995, Garcia had succumbed to a heart attack while in rehab in California. Weir was on the road with RatDog, a low-key side project that allowed him to partake in covers of the blues and R&B songs he loved. Refusing to cancel his gig in Hampton Beach, Weir told the couple of thousand in attendance, “Our departed friend, if he proved anything to us, he proved that good music makes sad times better.” In addition to a few lesser-known Dead songs, he also played Dylan's “Knockin' on Heaven's Door,” and spoke a few words at a press conference after.


	The entire Dead community was devastated that day, but Weir was especially shaken. “Jerry's passing hit us all hard, of course, but it was Bob's world that changed the most,” says drummer Mickey Hart. “His partner was gone — the sound that was always there when he played was gone. They both had stage fright, and they knew that being with each other canceled most of that out. They hung out together in the same onstage tent and yakked or played something during the break and before the concert. They felt comfortable in each other's presence.”


	Weir was also the first member of the Dead to return to the stage. “After Jerry died, I think we all came around to the idea that the music still belonged to all of us and any of us could do whatever we wanted with it,” says Kreutzmann. “It took me a few years to figure that out, but I think it took Bob about five minutes — he played a show in New Hampshire the very night Jerry died. That was also his way of processing it.”


	After flying to California for Garcia's memorial service, Weir quickly resumed his scheduled tour with RatDog. Matthew Kelly, who had met Weir in grade school and played with him in Kingfish and the first incarnation of RatDog, doesn't remember Weir breaking down about Garcia in those days. “Bobby's way of dealing with it would be different from other people's,” Kelly says. “Bobby was most comfortable when he was onstage. So the best way for him to heal was to keep playing in whatever configuration it might have been. And that's what he did.”


	To the puzzlement of Kelly and the other band members, though, that music rarely included Dead material, and at the start, Weir declined to recruit a lead guitarist to play similar parts to Garcia's. “The rest of us in the band got in some talks with Bobby about that,” Kelly says. “He said, ‘The more you guys keep saying that, the more I'm going to dig my heels in.' It was a bit uncomfortable, because the audience was very much expecting us to do that. The looks on their faces were disconcerting and troubling.”

	










“Jerry's passing hit us  all hard,” Mickey Hart  says. “But Bob's world changed the most.”


	The looks grew even more puzzled when Weir, known as the most boyishly handsome member of the Dead, grew facial hair, prompting comparisons to a Civil War reenactor or the cartoon character Yosemite Sam. “The beard happened out of sheer laziness while I was on tour,” Weir later told Rolling Stone. “And after being lazy and not shaving for a couple of weeks, I decided I liked the look. I think that's the way it happens for a lot of guys.” For McNally, the significance was deeper. In 1996, Weir, who'd been adopted, had reconnected with his real father, Jack Parber. One night, the two of them, along with McNally, took in a show together in San Francisco. “Jack looked at him and said, ‘That beard makes you look like your uncle,' presumably a brother of Jack's,” McNally says. “I heard that, and I went, ‘Bobby's never going to shave that beard.' Tell a guy who's been adopted that he looks like he's related to somebody? Forget it.”


	Weir was always eager to share anecdotes about Garcia and their escapades. But playing songs associated with his close friend — the one who had invited the teenage Weir into the jug band that became the Dead — remained daunting. Once, when RatDog were soundchecking for a show in Albany, New York, Weir began working up his first version of “Days Between,” the elegiac ballad Garcia and Robert Hunter had written toward the end of Garcia's life. “He was putting so much work into it,” says a former manager. “You could just tell he was working on something that meant so much to him. He was treating it with that kind of reverence.” As Weir began playing it, a dam burst. “He was crying while singing it. There was a hush in the room. You could just tell how much Jerry meant to him, how much the song meant to him. It showed so much.” At the time, though, those moments seemed few and far between.


	BACKSTAGE AT THE BILL GRAHAM Civic Auditorium in March 2010, Weir, in his customary sandals and T-shirt, took a few sips of red wine and prepared to go onstage with Furthur, the Dead offshoot he and Lesh had launched a few months before. “The Dead's gonna do what the Dead's gonna do,” he told Rolling Stone, talking about the mothership outfit. “We've got to sell tickets and not turn people off or disappoint them. We've got to fulfill some requirements.”


	Three years after Garcia's death, the surviving members of the Dead — Weir, Lesh, Hart, and Kreutzmann, along with sidekicks like Bruce Hornsby — began reconvening for tours, in various configurations. (Among the many guitarists recruited to step into Garcia's incredibly large shoes was Steve Kimock, who recalls asking Weir for direction and hearing back, “You're the fucking guy now. Do what you will or what you can.”) Weir stuck with RatDog, who were transitioning from bars and clubs to theaters. But whether it was the repertoire, the throngs of Deadheads eager to see them all play again, the larger venues or even the shared duties, the lure of the Dead was too strong to resist. As Weir told Rolling Stone in 2008, after the core four had reunited for a benefit for Barack Obama, “When I'm on the road with RatDog, it's a 14-hour day of set lists, interviews, and stuff. I'm on all the time. It's a little easier for me with the Dead. The other guys can take on those responsibilities.”

	











	Weir was right, but those tours — whether billed as the Other Ones or the Dead — were a blend of old camaraderie and lingering friction between the members. His bandmates could sometimes still treat Weir as the kid, busting his chops when he would forget a lyric onstage, as he did at least once on a Dead tour in 2009. But Weir appeared to roll with it, and the idea of writing new material with Furthur — his and Lesh's project, without Hart or Kreutzmann, who weren't invited — appealed to his restless creativity. “That's gonna be the next place we're gonna go,” he said before the San Francisco show, a 70th-birthday celebration for Lesh. “For instance, today, for the first time at soundcheck, we weren't practicing an old tune. We were kicking something around that will become a song. And it's about time.”

“It took me years to realize the music still belonged to us. It took Bob five minutes.”


	Rising above the intraband fray, Weir remained gentlemanly and affable. But backstage at the Graham Civic, and in other interviews during that time, he often came across as taciturn and burdened — especially compared with the other surviving Dead members, who could be jokey and wisecracking. Weir had never been averse to alcohol; among his many lifestyle rituals was burning off a night of wine with an intense morning run the next day. Kelly recalls Weir driving around Marin County's twisty roads after a fair bit of consumption. “It was a miracle he never died,” Kelly recalls. “I'd be terrified: ‘Bobby, can you slow down?' He'd go, ‘Yeah,' and step on the gas.” 


	But something had to give, and it finally did in a very public way. When Furthur took the stage of the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, New York, in 2013, Weir was already dealing with long-standing physical pain: “I'm going to have to have my shoulder replaced at some point,” he told Rolling Stone in 2008 — the result, he said, of years throwing footballs as part of his jock side. But as Deadheads watched in dismay, a clearly discombobulated Weir collapsed onstage. 


	Although Weir never specified, band members attributed it to Weir taking an Ambien pill instead of a painkiller for a shoulder injury. When Rolling Stone asked him in 2025 what he learned from that experience, he replied, “Take it easier on myself a little bit, and stuff like that.” Weir was back onstage two months after the incident, for a benefit in Marin, but the time came for him to address his issues, and he stepped away for an undetermined period. When the topic came up during an interview in 2014, the late John Perry Barlow, Weir's longtime friend and songwriting partner, said, “He's been taking a little personal time. I think he's doing more or less OK.” The same year, Lesh told Rolling Stone, “Yes, it makes me very concerned. But what to do?” For a moment, few knew the answer.

	











	WHEN HIS CELLPHONE LIT UP in 2013, Josh Kaufman wasn't sure who was ringing him at his home in Brooklyn — no caller ID. But it soon became clear: “Weir here,” came the same genial greeting so many had heard over the years.


	Weir's road to Blue Mountain, the album that would play a major role in his return, had started shortly before that call. A year earlier, Weir had collaborated with a slew of East Coast indie rockers, including members of the National, on two live sessions, one in honor of Garcia's 70th birthday. When Weir told Kaufman and the musicians he wanted the music to have a “cowboy ­swagger,” Kaufman helped conceive of a Weir album that'd tap into his love of cowboy songs and country. 


	On that phone call with Kaufman, Weir grabbed a guitar and started singing snippets of campfire songs from his past, eagerly ­wanting to add new verses to some of them. “I didn't feel starstruck anymore,” Kaufman says. “I just felt like, ‘Wow, this guy's just like us.' He's way cooler than us, but he's passionate and wants to look for something in this music still.”


	Recorded over a two-year period, Blue Mountain, Weir's first solo album since 1978's Heaven Help the Fool, was a beautifully ambient collection of modern-day ranch-hand ballads, and Weir soon launched an accompanying tour. But as Kaufman and his collaborators saw with the sledgehammer, the musical rebirth was just one part of his recovery. On tour, Weir's exercise gear, including resistance ropes, took up so much space in the bus that others on the tour had to stash their luggage in their own bunks. 


	Speaking with Rolling Stone in 2016, Weir noted some lifestyle changes that accompanied his workout regimen. “Oh, you know, I can't drink like I used to,” he said with a wise chuckle. Was that an issue? “Well, it depends on who you talk to,” he said. “I'm not as serious about drinking when I sit down to drink as I used to be. When I was more concerned about knocking 'em back, I wasn't focusing on the delights a good glass of wine had to offer.” (He also rolled with a question about how many pairs of Birkenstocks he owned: “Four or five. Two or three of those pair you won't want to own. I don't know why I keep them.”)


	Weir's second — or third — wind coincided with the renaissance of the Dead. In 2015, he'd participated in Fare Thee Well, the five-concert series that found the four surviving core members celebrating the group's 50th anniversary. Weir appeared back in control, and when he walked offstage one of the nights in Chicago, he flashed a smile, as if remembering the thrill of playing stadiums. Around the same time, in a moment Hart now calls “mythic,” Hart, Weir, and Mayer met at the Capitol Records building in Los Angeles. Soon after, Dead & Company, with John Mayer acquitting himself in the Garcia role better than anyone would have thought, set sail. “Bob finally had a lead guitar and could relax a bit,” says Hart, “and this took the weight off of being the only lead singer or guitarist.” Weir, Hart says, was “clean and sober, and Dead & Company was the new frontier.”

	











	As the new kid in the band, Mayer soon learned which cues to take from Weir. “Bobby and I had this wonderful push-pull where Bobby liked a certain demureness in the music,” Mayer says. “At that point in his life, he wanted to go into the song and a telling of the lyric and the song through subtlety. Early on, I was hitting it too hot, even when I knew I shouldn't. When I would mess up, Bobby liked it. He would look over at me and do the cross-eyed shake of his head, and I think it made him feel like I was willing to sign that same contract everyone in that band had signed, which is ‘We're going to mess up sometimes.' He probably liked it more when I messed up than when I hit a three-point shot, because he knew the messing up ­humbled me.”

“You could tell how much Jerry meant to Bob,” says Weir's former manager. 


	Combined with Fare Thee Well and Day of the Dead, the indie-all-star tribute of Dead songs that came a year later, the Dead — and their newly resurrected, been-there-survived-that frontman — were suddenly hip, paragons of Americana, self-reliance, and an indie spirit. For those who'd never seen Garcia onstage or only knew him as a figure from a distant past, Weir was now the living embodiment of the band, its vocal link to the past, its gravitas-steeped elder statesman. He was their Jerry, evidenced by the T-shirt vendors outside their shows who would sell shirts with only Weir's face on them.


	Weir also injected a sense of adventurousness into some of the members of Dead & Company, including former Allman Brothers Band bassist Oteil Burbridge. “I would think, ‘We're going to work on these songs,' and then Bob would do a 30-minute jam on something else we had no intention of working on,” Burbridge says, recalling the band's rehearsals. “It might be frustrating at times when you're like, ‘OK, we got to get these 12 songs done today,' but you just have to let your life proceed by its own design, and amazing things would come out of that, too. I was like, ‘Just hop on, man, wherever you're at — don't try to have a plan.'”


	Weir's renewal was also evident to Denise Kaufman, a musician and yoga instructor he'd met during the earliest days of the Dead. In 2018, Ace of Cups, the pioneering all-female San Francisco band she'd co-founded, was making a new album, and Kaufman invited Weir to sing on one of its songs, “The Well.” To Kaufman's surprise, Weir spent several very focused days in the studio, singing, adding new guitar parts, and rebooting the song. 


	By then, Weir's personal life had stabilized. In 1999, he had married his longtime girlfriend Natascha Muenter, with whom he had two daughters, Chloe and Shala (who goes by Monet, her middle name). Kaufman had last seen Weir in 2011, but the change was noticeable. “At that time, he was less healthy, but subsequently, it just seemed like everything in his life, the really important things, were more to the front,” she says. “He was valuing what matters in his own life.”

	










“Bob finally had a lead guitar,” Hart says of John Mayer. “He could relax. This took the weight off.”


	LAST JUNE, JUST A MONTH after his final shows with Dead & Company at the Sphere in Las Vegas, Weir was already onto his new musical adventure. Onstage at London's Royal Albert Hall, he and Wolf Bros — which also included Was, drummer Jay Lane, and keyboardist Jeff Chimenti — were refreshing the Dead repertoire, this time with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. The show was the latest in a series of orchestral Wolf Bros gigs begun the year before. “He said the weirdest thing to me when we were taking our bows,” Was recalls. “He loved the sound of that room. The orchestra was great. And he said, ‘Man, I'd be happy to die in this place.' I knew what he meant. But he didn't know how it was going to resonate six months later.”


	Wolf Bros began back in 2018. For what would be his last and most ambitious venture outside of the Dead, Weir unexpectedly reached out to Was, with whom Weir had occasionally worked over the previous two-plus decades. (Weir, a true believer in the messages conveyed in dreams, had dreamt of the late bassist Rob Wasserman recommending Was for the gig.) The idea, Was says, was to focus on Weir's songs and the characters in them rather than on the jammy side of the Dead. In typical on-the-fly fashion, Weir told Was to learn six Dead songs — then promptly forgot which ones when Was showed up for the trio's first rehearsal. “He just started ­playing what he felt at the moment,” Was says. “I think we jammed on a minor chord for 20 minutes.” When it stopped, Weir called his team and told them to book a tour; he'd already come up with “Wolf Bros” as the band name.


	For the following seven years, when he wasn't joining peers like Paul McCartney or Paul Simon onstage, Weir reinvented himself again with Bobby Weir and Wolf Bros. In such a spare setting, his unconventional guitar parts were more clearly and cleanly heard, and the shows felt like he was reclaiming his legacy outside of the Dead. (When Was suggested a few of Garcia's songs, like “To Lay Me Down,” Weir passed: “There was definitely resistance. Too close to something,” says Was.) At Third Man Records in Nashville, as owner Jack White looked on, the band also cut an album, which included the first studio version of “Jack Straw.” (According to Was, the album, produced by Dave Cobb, was largely finished by the time of Weir's death.) Late last year, Was received a text from Weir, relaying specific instructions about how to pare back the music even more and play fewer notes in the future.


	In the last year or so of his life, Weir's work revealed a sense of urgency. By last year, the Dead had lost many of its key members; Lesh, Barlow, and singer Donna Jean Godchaux had all died in the previous few years alone. According to Was, Weir would sometimes speak of death when the band was on the road. “He was acutely aware that time was running out,” he says. “Not as quickly as it actually did, but he was aware that he wasn't going to be around forever to play these songs.” That, he says, was partly the impetus for arranging the Dead repertoire for symphonies: “He told Jay, Jeff, and me that his intention was for us to continue playing those shows when he couldn't do it anymore.”


	Last summer, the Dead celebrated their 60th anniversary at Golden Gate Park, which again confirmed Weir's central role. Still not the most physically expressive character on stage, his satisfaction was clear to Lesh's son Grahame, who joined the band for a few songs. “Bob would have this sort of little grin kind of behind the mustache,” Grahame says. But to Burbridge, the shows also revealed that Weir was coping with unspecified health issues. “He was moving very slow,” he says. “Everybody could see he was struggling. The fact he pulled it off was the highlight.” The future appeared hazy, too. Weir had been a road dog for so long — he even parked his tour bus outside of the Sphere despite renting a nearby home during the band's run there — that the dearth of any live dates for 2026 was startling, almost alarming, to those in the Dead world.

	











	Just before Christmas, members of Dead & Company, Weir included, reunited in a holiday-greetings group text. But according to those who knew or worked with Weir, his last few months were private ones as he dealt with his cancer. Hearing that his friend of nearly 60 years was in his final days, Hart visited Weir at his home in Mill Valley, California. “We went for a ride — he drove my car and seemed on the mend,” Hart says. “Then down the rabbit hole he went.” Those in the dark about the decline of Weir's health were stunned when his family announced that he had “transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones.” 

“Bob said, ‘Man, I'd be happy to die in this place,' ”  Was recalls. “I knew what  he meant.”


	For both longtime Deadheads and those who'd discovered the band in more recent times, Weir's passing wasn't just the loss of another classic-rock hero. Although Hart and Kreutzmann remain, the disappearance of the last voice of the Dead felt cataclysmic. “There's certainly a generation that has now grown up with Bob being their closest connection to that music, especially with Phil passing,” says Kaufman. “I know a lot of my friends and I are feeling extra emotional, because this thing is gone now. The front line is gone.” The future of Dead & Company is very much up in the air, but as Grahame Lesh says, “You can't really replace Bob, and we're going to find that out even more now.” Weir himself saw it coming, as he told Rolling Stone in 2016. During an early show with Dead & Company, he flashed to another scene. “It was 20 years later, and I look over to my right and John had turned gray,” he said. “I looked over to my left at Jeff and his hair was silver. Then I looked back at the drum riser and there were two kids back there, all holding forth and serving the music.” The vision then appeared in a dream that same night. “I awoke with the revelation that if we serve this legacy, it'll just go on,” he said. “And people will be teaching this in music school in 200 or 300 years. That's an edifying feel. But it also came with the responsibility of doing this right.”

						Mayer and Weir in New York, 2015.					







							By 

	Shirley Halperin




T
here are few things more enjoyable to a Deadhead than going deep on the intricacies of their live shows: the set lists, the solos, the strange time signatures, and the amorphic grooves. John Mayer, who joined Dead & Company in 2015 on guitar and vocals, is here for it all — as a fan, and as a friend to the late Bob Weir. 


	Mayer took his responsibility as a steward for the Grateful Dead's canon of timeless songs seriously. As Dead & Company evolved, it was about establishing trust with the man to Mayer's left. “You give someone your wallet, and they give it back to you enough times where all your money is still in it, you stop checking the wallet,” he says in his signature banter. “Bob was never a highly verbal guy when it came to managing a band. He was the leader, but not through a lot of negotiation or expression.”


	Speaking to Rolling Stone while still processing the loss of his bandmate, the seven-time Grammy winner and new co-owner of Chaplin Recording Studios let the tears flow along with fond and funny memories of their time together.

	











How did you first link up with Bobby? The first thing Bob and I ever did together was “Althea” on The Late Late Show, which I guest-­hosted in February 2015. I had met him a couple of weeks earlier in Don Was' office. They had just announced the Fare Thee Well 50th-­anniversary shows, and Don let me know that Bob and Mickey [Hart] were going to be in that morning. At the time, I was recording at Capitol Studios. And I don't think I was slated to go in that day, but I did so I could meet Bobby and Mickey. 

	











	By then, I had fallen in love with the Grateful Dead. It's like they had 24 notes and the rest of the world had 12. That's how it sounded to me. I was like, “Where have all these notes been hiding?” I liked it so much that I remember taking out my phone and just recording what was coming off of the Grateful Dead channel [on SiriusXM], because I didn't know what songs these were. I actually liked not knowing. I like knowing, but there's just as much fun in not quite understanding what moment you're listening to.

	I probably would have ended up playing Grateful Dead music even if I hadn't done it with Bobby. I have a way of proselytizing to people what their music means to me. Or, I suppose, in some way, I was reading Bobby's fortune as I was explaining to him and Mickey what the music really meant [to me] up in Don's office. Bob looked at me and said, “Do you want to be our publicist?” Then he said, “What are you doing on March 7?” And I said, “Whatever you want me to do,” and he invited me up to his studio in the Bay Area.


What happened next?Bobby and Mickey were kicking around this idea of taking Grateful Dead music and modernizing it, technologically. And I remember thinking, “Please don't do that,” because what they didn't know, and what I could see, was that — and I think I said pretty close to this — the most state-of-the-art thing they could do in 2015 was to present the music exactly as they always had. Don't get bored. Don't get clever. If you just go analog Grateful Dead, without any modernization, it's going to be the most state-of-the-art thing to people my age and younger.


	I think probably what I was trying to do, as much as figure out what we could do together, was to try to impress upon them, like, “What you're doing is cool. Don't do a software update. You have no idea how much we love this.” 

“I spent every day learning songs. It was like being an actor, immersing myself.”


	My generation had finished hearing everything. This homogenization of even things that were supposed to be randomized, like JACK FM; we'd heard every classic song through Guitar Hero, or other outlets. And when you've heard it all, and then you hear Grateful Dead, it's the greatest gift, because you're like, “Are you telling me there's another world of music that I could get into now?” Imagine someone came up to you and said, “There's 20 more seasons of The Sopranos.” That's how it feels to become a Deadhead. Every fan of the music, at one point, liked what they heard and realized, “Oh, my God, I'm about to get into a thing that's going to change my life.”


How was it playing the music with Bobby for the first time?I went up to the studio with maybe eight songs under my hands. And I remember recording it so I could listen back to it later and there being maybe eight seconds at a time that would sound like magic, for me. Like, “Oh, that, right there, was a spark” — and the rest of it, me just cringing.  The songs under my hands first were the ones that I think I gravitated to as a writer. They were a little simpler. They were a little more on the pop side in terms of the way they were written. And it didn't matter if I didn't know the other songs. There would just be these moments where the landing gear would go up and we'd just lift.

So that's when you signed on to Dead & Company? It was up there that I had this incredible offer to join whatever the band was going to be, to enter into that partnership. To me, that was like, “I'm going to be in the next Star Wars movie,” or, “I'm going to play on the Yankees.” I'm joining an institution that is beyond an honor. It's invaluable. It's above anyone's ability to quantify what it is. I remember saying to Don Was, “Am I in some form of the Dead now?” And he was like, “Yeah, you are.” We were on our way to dinner, and I was sitting in the car with Don, like, “Um, does this mean I'm in the Dead?” Don is like, “I think it means you're in the Dead.”


	And honest to God, I never dined out on it. I never counted any of it up. I had the gig, and I was going to do the gig as well as I could do the gig. I always knew that I could get it right the next tour. That's all I was thinking about. I knew the thing is too big to think about. If you really think about what this meant, how could you do it? How could you pull it off? I remember watching the Long Strange Trip documentary on Amazon. That must have come out maybe two years after I joined the band, and I thought to myself, “I am so glad I didn't know all of this before I took the stage with them for the first time.” 


	Then from that period on, it was like, “OK, I got to go learn these songs.” I spent every day learning songs. It was like being an actor and preparing for a role — immersing myself in the material. I basically stayed in the house and learned the tunes, but I was also falling in love with the tunes at the same time. The fuse was lit. I was in the car, driving a lot at that point, and I just had the Grateful Dead channel on Sirius. Every time I heard something, I'd take a picture of the screen. “OK, so, that's what that one is called.”


What were some pivotal learning moments? I knew “Dark Star,” but I didn't know the core theme of the tune until I really kept listening to it, and broke it down after several versions and went, “OK, I understand now.” And this happened for every song. As I'm learning how great “Ramble On Rose” sounds, I'm also learning it's in D. It moves from the one to the major two-seven. They must have not been precious about arrangements. They had something called “a new One.” No one has ever said this in music. 

	











	“Well, what is this?” “It's just a new One… which means you just count from one again on this beat.” “Well, does that put it in a different time signature?” “We don't know.”


	So I'm having this really full experience, not just as a listener, but as a guitar player at the same time, which was so fun.


	I remember telling people that I felt like a contractor — like somebody walked me into a space that had really good bones, and were like, “Can you make this a high-end restaurant in six months?” I look around and go, “I can give you a restaurant in six months,” and I just got to work. I would love to say that I had known every one of these songs front to back before I met Bobby, but that's not how life works. We get into stuff when we get into stuff.

“There were moments where the landing gear would go up and we'd just lift.”


Talk a bit about playing next to Bobby. Watching you both, it seemed like there was a lot of signaling going on.It changed over the years, because we both got to know each other and trust each other. And I also became more comfortable with the music. I'll give you an example: As much as I want to lean back at the very beginning when I'm playing, I couldn't help overplaying in some of those first few tours. You just do. Even if I knew not to overplay, I'm still going to overplay. It's going to be wordy. I have to adjust my way into the 10-ring on the target. 


	You could tell yourself not to get nervous, you know exactly why you shouldn't be nervous, and your hands are going to shake. It's just a natural, physiological moment you have to break through to get comfortable through experience. I was obsessed with trying to get it better. I loved the sport of people saying that I was basically a buffoon. Because obviously some of it's cartoonish, but some of the notes were good. I loved taking those notes and getting another crack at the ball. … It was very athletic for me. I want to get my pitch mechanics better. I want my mind to go slower. I want to spend more time in the song.


	We never talked about it. But towards the end, maybe from '23 on, and certainly the two Sphere runs, we had done it for so long. How did I read his signals? I just knew the way his head moved — we all do — and had an understanding of what his instincts were night after night. It got to the point where, in those last few tours, he knew when I would step forward and really hit the gas. And because I'd figured it out by then, I knew when to step back, look at Bobby and say, “It's yours again.” 


	We were aligned. Bobby and I both had the same clock — where he knew what I was going to do, and he knew I'd give it back and go, “All yours.” There were times where Bobby started singing as a way of letting me know, “That's the end of your solo, son.” 

	











	I spent a lot of shows in the beginning wondering if he was upset. I'd think: “I hope he's happy. He might not be. Oh, he just went and turned his guitar amp up. Does that mean he thinks I'm too loud? Is someone going to come into my [dressing] room and say, ‘Hey, can you turn your guitar down?'” Then one day, you walk up onstage and there's plexiglass between the amps and you go, “I have a feeling I'm a little too loud.”


This might be hard to quantify, but was there a time when you felt you finally belonged on that stage? The first couple of tours were proving to the audience that I had a right to be there. And the rest of the tours were proving to Bobby that I meant well for everything I was trying to do. You got to understand, I never quantified it. And I don't think Bob ever quantified it. Looking at it now, I think he never interacted with whatever that energy field was of adulation, or “Oh, my God, can you believe?” He didn't account for it. And oddly, I didn't account for it — only when I heard what it meant to people.

“I realized Bobby would entrust me with anything, and I would come through.”


	These were the things that we look back on now — all the fabric of the sadness — that made these loving feelings I have for him forever. We never got in a fight. When I felt like I had a little tenure, I could speak up. I think, in his eyes, I began as this kind of cocky kid who rolled in and went, “I want to play this music. Let's go. Here's how I think it should be.” And he's like, “Just wait, just hold on a minute.”


	But that's always been the way that I am. I'm not trying to do anything other than enthusiastically get it to where it's great. And I think whatever conversations Bob had on the bus about me in the very beginning changed over the years. By the end of it, the music taught me how to just play. You're allowed to get “Slipknot!” wrong. They love it when you do. That's why “Slipknot!” was written. It's like a water park, and sometimes you get water up your nose, and that's what you love. 


What else changed over the years?I learned exactly where Bobby wanted his tempos. That was huge, because tempos were important to Bob. Once he let me start the tunes, even the ones he sang, I put that fucker — the song, not him — in the right tempo so that Bobby could do his best stuff on it. I loved that part.


	Even as he got older, I started to give myself the responsibility of being another set of eyes and hands and ears. It was like, “I want to put it where you want to put it. I want to help you get it to where you hear it.” Because I think as the years went on, I knew what he was saying. He was ultimately right about where to put the song, where to make it relax.


	I sat in with him with Wolf Bros one night, and it was the best experience for me, because I think Wolf Bros was Bobby's opportunity to have a band where he's not collaborating with somebody. I always understood that. And when I got to see Bobby do Wolf Bros shows, I went, “Oh, if this is what he's thinking, I can give him that. I can give him that in Dead & Company.”

	











	And I think towards the end I did. I knew what he wanted and also started knowing that my best versions of some of these songs had already been played, that there were tours that probably had the versions of some of these songs that would go down in the books. So let's get it.


Dead & Company at the Sphere was an interesting undertaking in that it didn't allow for as much improvisation, but still provided a true Dead experience. Yeah. And I know the Sphere had a little of a hermetically sealed thing to it, if you are a purist when it comes to the vibrations of going to a Dead concert. But it was a big step forward in terms of how you could make the technology work with the music. And that is where the Bobby and John crossover was complete. Those last two Sphere concert runs, those residencies, is where Bob loved going over the show, knowing that you can't change the content because it takes them half a day to lock the [visuals]. 


	I really saw him enjoy a Vegas residency, and he got to be a little bit of Mr. Showbiz, in terms of [call times] every day. I think Bobby loved flying to Vegas for the big show, and having the same dressing room, and the same bus, and the same hallways.


	It was never spoken, but there was a moment I realized Bobby would entrust me with anything, and I would come through. Those final years, Bobby would be walked to the stage by his security guy, and I was the guy who took it from that point. Like an auxiliary. I would always take care of him. 


What went through your mind when Bobby died?When Bobby died, I thought, “These circuits are going to light up so bright. The love for him is going to be so off the charts, it's going to shock people who aren't in the know.” And then I immediately thought, “Boy, that's a lot of people who become disconnected from the mainframe.” 


	I have a feeling that a lot of people were like, “I don't know this guy or this music, but why is everyone I love really upset?” And it's because this guy was so integral to the entire structure. He carried it. I mean, he couldn't explain it when it was here. You can't explain it when it's gone. How do you explain the loss of something that they tried to write books explaining the presence of?


	And I get upset when I talk about it because that's the part … Now that I'm on the other side of that, and obviously it's not the first time I'd ever thought about life after Dead & Company, but I had no idea exactly what would light up, both in the things I'm grateful for and the things that I'm so sad not to have. 

	











Your eulogy at Bobby's memorial in San Francisco was so perfect and loving. Did you struggle writing it, or did it just flow out? Well, I struggled with it because it all came out so quickly that it wouldn't fit Instagram, and I didn't want to do “continued in comments.” I had been writing it since the day after he died. 


You said, “I'll do it your way, Bob.” What did that mean? I realized that none of what I could say was going to get me anywhere. The more I wrote, the further away I got. The more I wrote, the bigger the book got. I knew I had hit it because I started sobbing. And I wrote, “OK, Bobby, I'll do it your way. Thank you for letting me ride alongside you. It sure was a pleasure.” Do you have any idea how brutal that feels to be that simple? It broke me, because I had found the way to say it. When I looked at it, I just sobbed and went, “God damn it, this is going to be it, isn't it?” 


	“His way” is a short tip of the hat in which everything else is implied. It's “Vaya con Dios.” It's “See you down the road.” In my mind, it's a violent simplification of emotion.  And I was so emotional when I did it because I was proud that I had figured out how to honor him. I couldn't believe that I was going to press send and hated letting go of someone's hand, that it was going to be that short. But by the way, that's my greatest tribute to Bob Weir, the guy who couldn't wait [for me] to finish talking. I mean, he loved it by the end, but I'm verbose. “His way” is sending him off in his language, and I think he would've been so touched. My offering was doing this thing I have never done before in my life, and probably never will again, which is: forgo language.


It's hard not to take note of the universal alignment of having Jerry lead the Dead for its first 30 years, and Bobby for the latter, from 1995 to 2025. And now that Bob has moved to that other side of the veil, I don't know what I'm listening to. I don't know where to put my ear. I don't know where he is. I know where Jerry is when I listen. We all knew where Jerry was, because we all knew where Bob was. And these two were so close. They just represented one another. They were on either side of the split. Jerry was on the afterlife side and the spiritual side, and Bob was on the earth side.


Well, the first days are the hardest days …We've got to learn. Bobby would want us to learn how to listen to this music without him, but with him. Deadheads did it in the Nineties. They figured out where to place Jerry. And now it's our job to figure out where we put Bob in the listening. Where do we put our hearts?

							By 

	Rolling Stone



	Robert Duvall may have been the epitome of gravitas onscreen. Whether he was playing a stern patriarch, a ruthless corporate boss, a morally bankrupt military officer, or a grizzled ex-con, he captured the quiet essence of the man, conveying a character's entire life force through one look. Duvall grounded roles that could be over-the-top in the wrong hands, and was content to play second fiddle if his talents served the story… though never without stealing scenes. His screen career spanned from 1960 to 2022, nearly all of those decades filled with exceptional work. Here are our 15 favorite roles from an incredible filmography.


	The story goes that the legendary playwright Horton Foote saw Robert Duvall in a 1957 production of his work The Midnight Caller, and that inspired him to recommend the young actor for Duvall's film debut in director Robert Mulligan's adaptation of Harper Lee's beloved To Kill a Mockingbird. Radley is a complex role, a character who is an outsider to the entire community and ends up being a savior to the Finch children. Duvall imbues him with such graceful interiority, playing him as three-dimensional instead of just a convenient plot device. Radley saves Jem and Scout, which makes him a hero, but he's still the outsider in fictional Maycomb, Alabama, the one who the local kids (and some adults) found terrifying. After he saves her near the end of the film, Boo gives a look to Jem that conveys a well of affection and pride without a single line of dialogue. Duvall would carve out a career of characters who contained that silent strength, and it started here. —Brian Tallerico


	Rip Torn was originally cast in this early Francis Ford Coppola drama about a woman on a road trip who's attempting to outrun her unsatisfying life; he was supposed to play a highway patrolman who gives her a speeding ticket and ends up her taking her home, but he had to drop out for scheduling reasons before he'd shot a single scene. James Caan, who was starring alongside Shirley Knight, said he knew a guy who could sub in — a New York actor with a few impressive screen credits on his resumé (To Kill a Mockingbird, The Chase, Bullitt) named Bobby. This was Duvall's first collaboration with Coppola, and though the role is relatively minor, it's still a crucial one in terms of the movie's tragic third act. It also offers a sneak peek of Duvall's ability to seem simultaneously charismatic and menacing, as well as a preview of the many stern, shouting fathers he'd play later in his career. —David Fear


	Uptight, unpleasant, unskilled, and yet somehow kissable, Duvall's character in M*A*S*H, Major Frank Burns, is the first domino to fall in Robert Altman's black comedy about wacky Korean War surgeons (which preceded the TV series by two years). New arrivals Hawkeye and Duke peg the ultra-religious Burns as a jerk as soon as they meet him (and when he excoriates a younger soldier for accidentally killing a man, that first impression is confirmed) so they set about tormenting him any way they can, broadcasting Burns' liaison with a female new arrival (“Kiss my hot lips,” she tells Duvall) and needling at him until he explodes. Duvall is the perfect straight man in film filled with goofballs. —Kory Grow


	Tom Hagen is presented in Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 masterpiece as the cool head in a family of hot ones. The consigliere to Al Pacino's Michael Corleone, he represents the traditional way of doing things as an ally and advisor to Vito — the old-fashioned voice trying to calm the aggressive new generation of warriors like James Caan's Sonny. When he's the only one left that Michael can trust, he becomes the acting don, but even Tom is eventually betrayed. Duvall has a ton of unforgettable lines in his filmography, but near the top of the list is “Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you.” To Tom Hagen, it's never been just business. Going against him isn't just going against reason and rationality; it's going against history, allegiance, and family. Pacino, Caan, Brando, and De Niro arguably got more attention for these films, but they just don't work without Duvall. —B.T.


	Playwright Horton Foote had written the screenplay for To Kill a Mockingbird, Duvall's film debut, as well as the script for The Chase, the Arthur Penn drama that marked the first time Duvall shared the screen with Marlon Brando. Foote and Duvall were already well acquainted with each other when the actor starred in Foote's stage adaptation of a William Faulkner short story about a laconic sharecropper named Jackson Fentry who befriends a pregnant woman. When it came time to shoot a film version deep in the rural South, Duvall reprised the role — and while this modest, black-and-white indie may be the least-known title on this list, it's definitely one of Duvall's essential works. In an essay he wrote about Duvall for the book Close-Ups, Foote noted how spent weeks watching the New York actor slowly transform himself into “an inarticulate Mississippi tenant farmer,” and by the time he'd arrived on set, almost every trace of him had disappeared into the character. “He has that special ability to enter another culture,” the playwright noted, “to give himself to it and absorb it for creative use.” There are moments in Tomorrow when you don't feel like you're watching someone performing at all. —D.F.


	Based on a Richard Stark crime novel, The Outfit is a gritty revenge masterpiece. In the film, Duvall plays Earl Macklin, a hardboiled ex-con with enough guts to take on a whole mafia family (the titular outfit) after they kill his brother. The Macklins had robbed a bank the Outfit operated and served time for doing so, but the way Earl sees it, the Outfit owes him a quarter of a million dollars — and he's determined to collect on the sum however he can and take out anyone who gets in his way. Bloody, explosive, and intense, The Outfit captures Duvall's knack for playing characters with unquenchable determination at the top of his game. —K.G.


	In The Godfather, Robert Duvall played a character who swam with sharks, but even the Corleone family pales in comparison to the monsters who run network television. In Sidney Lumet's Oscar-winning smackdown of evil corporations and the idiocy of the small screen, Duvall's Frank Hackett is a ruthless executive at the struggling Union Broadcasting System who gets his prayers answered when his nighttime news anchor goes bonkers on camera, triggering a ratings juggernaut. Duvall's ability to both simmer with rage and ooze superiority was perfectly wielded here, creating the definitive portrait of the soulless company man who values profits over everything else. Some of Network's satirical targets haven't aged well in 50 years, but the Frank Hacketts of the world have only multiplied. Duvall made the man utterly contemptible and absolutely unstoppable. —Tim Grierson


	Everyone knows the line that became one of the most famous in the history of war movies: “I love the smell of napalm in the morning.” But there's another one at the end of the same scene that also has a striking resonance: “Someday this war's gonna end.” Duvall hits it with a sigh and something akin to a frown instead of optimism. It's almost defeated resignation, as if his Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore isn't sure he wants this chaos to end. He'll miss the surfing, the soldiers, “Ride of the Valkyries,” and, yes, the smell of napalm. Duvall reportedly thought Kilgore was too exaggerated on the page (where he was named Colonel Carnage), and asked Coppola if he could do his own research to make the guy more genuine. And it's that character work, the backstory and detail that's there in every subtle beat, that makes this part so memorable. —B.T.


	There are problematic screen dads, and then there's Lt. “Bull” Meachum, the Marine pilot who runs his family with the same zero-tolerance, drop-and-give-me-20 attitude as a drill sergeant runs his platoon. Whether Duvall based any of his character's military-man parenting style on his own upbringing — his own father was a rear admiral in the Navy, though Duvall claimed he was a lot more passive than Meachum — he certainly committed 100 percent to playing this patriarch without sanding down the rougher edges. Bull is especially hard on his eldest son Ben, played by Caddyshack's Michael O'Keefe, and the scene in which a competitive one-on-one game ends with Dad bouncing a basketball off his boy's head while taunting him is still hard to watch. (Ditto the scene where Bull tells Ben to take out a player on another team who's fouled him, or he shouldn't bother coming home.) The performance nabbed Duvall his first Best Actor Oscar nomination. He should have won. —D.F.


	When Robert Duvall won Best Actor for his portrayal of faded country star Mac Sledge, he told the Academy Awards audience that he was especially honored that the giants of the music genre — including Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, and Waylon Jennings — thought so highly of his performance. “If I didn't have that on one hand,” Duvall said, “I would feel that this on the other hand was not complete.” When making Tender Mercies, Duvall insisted that he do his own singing, even writing a few of Sledge's songs. It was just one example of the authenticity and compassion he brought to his portrayal of a has-been musician laid low by addiction and personal failings who was determined to redeem himself. So often, Hollywood condescends to or mocks characters who live in the “real America,” but Duvall never allows Sledge to be a simplistic good ol' boy or, conversely, a blandly saintly figure of pure virtue. It's a tough, tender performance — and one of those rare cases when a great actor actually took home an Oscar for one of his best roles. — T.G.


	Released a year after Lethal Weapon, this Dennis Hopper–directed film tackled the familiar ground of a hotshot rookie cop (in this case, Sean Penn) paired with a hardened veteran (Duvall), only with a more believable plot (these two are fighting gangs, not Lethal Weapon's Gary Busey in a helicopter) and a better soundtrack (Ice-T!). At the time, Penn had cultivated an off-screen bad-boy image that seemed to define the role and played well against Duvall's professionalism. Ultimately, Duvall stole the show in a scene where Penn's character lusts after a fast-food server. “You heard the one about the two bulls?” Duvall asks, leading him to tell a parable anyone who's seen the movie has never forgotten. —K.G.


	Duvall said it took him 10 days to read Larry McMurty's doorstopper of a novel, about two former Texas Rangers who embark on a cattle drive from the Lone Star State to Montana, and roughly 16 weeks to shoot the four-part TV adaptation. The impact it had on the actor, however, would last a lifetime, and he routinely referred to this miniseries as the highlight of his career well into his autumn years. Duvall had originally been offered the role of Captain Woodrow F. Call, the more straitlaced and upstanding of the duo. He reportedly told the producers that he'd already done a million variations on that type of cowboy and was more interested in playing the other part: Captain Gus McCrae, a gentleman with a love of good times, strong women, and even stronger liquor, provided the bartender serving it shows the proper amount of respect. It's impossible now to think of anyone else playing this lawman — the same goes for Tommy Lee Jones, who'd end up steeping into Call's dusty boots — and their pairing on the prairie is a big part of why Lonesome Dove's fan base keeps growing with every generation. “The only healthy way to live, as I see it, is to love the little everyday things,” McCrae says in a moment of philosophical reflection. “Like a good whiskey, a soft bed, a glass of buttermilk. Or, say, a feisty gentleman like myself.” If you ever want to see grown men burst into tears, just show them the goodbye scene between the two old friends, which Duvall plays close to the vest yet still leaves you quietly wrecked. —D.F.


	Roger Ebert once said that the movies that make him cry are “the films about goodness — about people acting bravely or generously in self-sacrifice.” Director Martha Coolidge's hybrid of character study, memory play, and coming-of-age story Rambling Rose is one of the best examples of how Duvall could so deftly play goodness. His ability to project old-fashioned decency served him well in period pieces, his square jaw and classic Hollywood good looks never feeling anachronistic for films set generations ago. His presence adds veracity to this Great Depression tale of a prostitute (played by Laura Dern, in one of her best performances) who is taken in by a Southern family led by Duvall and Diane Ladd. Duvall's patriarch, Buddy Hillyer, is a man who makes mistakes, but also one who knows right from wrong, a truth Duvall gets across with small gestures instead of big monologues. In a film in which Dern and Ladd got a lot of deserved attention, he's the foundation of the ensemble. —B.T.


	Duvall wrote, directed, financed, and starred in this 1997 tale of sin and redemption about a Pentecostal preacher who kills his wife's lover, goes on the lam, and reinvents himself as the anonymous “Apostle E.F.” in the deep swamps of Louisiana. Duvall is electric as E.F., whether he's preaching the word to his new congregation, administering last rites to a car-crash victim in a field, or beating the ass of — and later converting — a racist hell-bent on tearing down the E.F's church. Duvall earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, mesmerizing audiences with a performance that, like those given by the best evangelists, was both charismatic and compassionate. “Preaching is one of the great American art forms. The rhythm, the cadence,” he told The New York Times in 1997. “And nobody knows about it except the preachers themselves.” —Joseph Hudak


	Duvall spent much of the last few decades of his career showing up for glorified cameos that mainly called on him to play the embodiment of éminence grise gravitas. But he was given a gift by director Aaron Schneider in the form of Felix Bush, a recluse living in the hills of Tennessee. One day, Bush rides into town and invites the locals to attend his funeral. Never mind that he hasn't gone to the Great Beyond just yet — the old man has decided to throw himself a pre-emptive wake. Duvall leans into the character's cantankerous old-coot persona, and it's a pleasure to see Duvall sink his teeth into a lead role again. Then comes his time to deliver a eulogy, and an entirely different side of Bush comes out. Over the course of a six-and-a-half minute monologue, we find out why this hermit feels he doesn't belong to the community. The way that Duvall reveals someone unburdening their soul from decades of shame and regret is a powerful reminder of how he could turn a confessional speech into its own three-act play. Get Low gave him the opportunity for one last great performance in a career already filled with so many heights. —D.F.

The Jersey Shore's Hit Music Channel

UFOs are back in the headlines following a recent interview with Barack Obama. It's time to ask again how many New Jersey residents believe in them.

We conducted an informal survey over the past few days to see how many people believe in unidentified flying objects, aliens, and abductions, and you might be surprised by the results.

It is a far cry from believing there are unidentified craft in our skies as compared to little grey or green beings walking around our planet.

We considered that when we broke the answers down into categories. We asked New Jersey residents inan informal survey their thoughts on UFOs, and here is what we learned.

Here are the results from our unscientific survey. We asked random state residents and listeners to my radio show if they believed in the following three things, and here are the percentages of people who said they do.

Believe in UFOs - 78%

Believe Aliens Are On The Earth - 43%

Believe Alien Abductions Are Real - 19%

The statistic that surprises me the most is the ""aliens on Earth"" number. Nearly half of New Jersey residents think they are among us.

According to the National UFO Reporting Center, there have been three UFO sightings in New Jersey in 2026. They were reported in Chatham, Atlantic City, and Bridgewater.

The former president appeared to confirm decades-old conspiracy theories, but then he walked back his podcast comments.

Former president Barack Obama this weekend appeared to drop an otherworldly bombshell: extraterrestrials exist.

Former President Barack Obama recently said he believes aliens are real — but clarified that he has never seen one and does not believe they are being held at Area 51.

In a Feb. 15 Instagram post, Obama expanded on earlier podcast comments, saying that “the odds are good there's life out there,” citing the vastness of the universe. However, he added that he believes the chances Earth has been visited by aliens are slim.

That leaves a lingering question: Where are the aliens?

The National UFO Reporting Center collects reports of unexplained flying objects and unidentified anomalous phenomena for investigation. Since its founding in 1974, the organization says it has processed more than 180,000 reports nationwide.

In New York state alone, the center has logged 6,309 UFO and UAP sighting reports.

The earliest reported New York sighting dates back to 1790 in Carlisle.

According to the database, the unnamed witness — whose account was submitted in 2007 — described seeing what was believed to be a meteor while playing the fiddle outside on a summer night.

“The meteor as I shall now call it, was about 300 yards long in a serpentine shape, excepting the head which resembled the root of a tree plucked up by force,” the witness wrote. “It had no appearance of a neck, the body was thick as a bullock, tapering off like a serpent at the end of the tail.”

The most recent report was filed Feb. 5 in Poughkeepsie. The witness said they saw three bright lights forming what appeared to be a “V-shaped craft” while driving near the Route 44/55 exit to the Hudson Bridge on Route 9. No explanation was listed in the report.

While thousands of sightings have been reported in New York, many have later been attributed to planets, stars, aircraft or even Chinese lanterns.

For now, though, the question of where the aliens are remains unanswered.

The former president was forced to clarify his comments after an interview with Brian Tyler Cohen

Former President Barack Obama sat down with influencer Brian Tyler Cohen for a friendly conversation that centered on the political divisions roiling the country, but there was one exchange that seemed to unite disparate factions, at least temporarily, in a shared excitement: the moment Obama seemed to confirm the existence of aliens. 

“Are aliens real?” Cohen asked the former president point-blank.

“They're real,” Obama replied, before adding, “But I haven't seen them and they're not being kept in Area 51. There is no underground facility. Unless there is this enormous conspiracy, and they hid it from the president of the United States.” 

The former president went on to joke that the first question he wanted answered when he became president was “Where are the aliens?”

The YouTube video of the one-on-one conversation has attracted more than 4 million views since it was posted on Saturday. 

Obama posted the alien clip to his own Instagram account on Sunday evening, but tamped down enthusiasm for his comments in the caption.

“I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it's gotten attention let me clarify. Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there,” the former president wrote. “But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we've been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”

Obama's view on the possibility of extraterrestrial existence has, with developments in astronomy, become the scientific consensus.

As the journalist Garret M. Graff, author of UFO: The Inside Story of the US Government's Search for Alien Life Here—and Out There, reported for Rolling Stone, advances in technology have helped scientists put a figure to the number of habitable planets — planets with the conditions to support life as we recognize it — in the universe. Current estimates hover around one sextillion such planets or one billion trillions. 

With those numbers, the odds are heavily in favor of the possibility that life is out there — just very far away. The absolute closest galaxy to ours, the Andromeda Galaxy, is roughly 2.5 million lightyears away; the 100,000 galaxies that make up our next closest neighbors exist in a “cosmic suburb” that spans roughly 520 million lightyears of outer space. As Graff wrote, “The math may very well be on the side of the aliens existing, but that's largely because the math of the universe itself turns out to be astounding.”

Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri arrives at the Los Angeles Superior Court before testifying on Feb. 11, 2026.

Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, appeared in a Los Angeles courtroom Wednesday as an “adverse witness” in a landmark trial over claims that Meta's Instagram and Google's YouTube functioned as “digital casinos,” dispensing dopamine-driven rewards to keep children scrolling despite known risks.

Minutes after taking the stand, he was confronted with remarks from a podcast interview he gave in March 2020 where he said, “There's such a thing as being addicted to a social media platform.” Mosseri told jurors he had misspoken. “Clearly, I wasn't careful with my words during that podcast,” he testified in the packed courtroom in downtown Los Angeles. “Sometimes I make mistakes.”





































When Lori Harito started noticing the slow death of traditional media, she just knew she couldn't stay where she was. In the volatile world of Canadian content, where the ground shifts daily beneath the feet of creators, Harito's transition from the newsroom to the boardroom of her own boutique PR agency, Boulevard of Dreams, feels less like a career pivot and more like a necessary evolution.

“Journalism is an unstable, unsteady career path, but it was something I truly, truly loved,” Harito reflects. That foundation, a deep-rooted respect for the trenches of storytelling, is exactly what is currently disrupting the often-sterile and overly corporate world of public relations. Along with her partner-in-strategy, Kelly McCabe, Harito is proving that in 2026, the most valuable currency isn't just reach, it's keeping a finger on the pulse.

Called as the first witness in a closely watched trial over claims Meta and YouTube negligently designed platforms that were addictive to children, Lembke, the medical director of Stanford University's addiction medicine program and the author of the best-selling book Dopamine Nation, said young users' brains are “especially vulnerable” to problems associated with those four traits. The reason, she told jurors, is that adolescents' prefrontal cortices are not yet fully integrated with deeper midbrain systems that regulate behavior.

































Seattle Seahawks' quarterback #14 Sam Darnold and Seattle Seahawks' head coach Mike Macdonald celebrate with the Vince Lombardi Trophy after the Seattle Seahawks defeated the New England Patriots during Super Bowl LX at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California on February 8, 2026.

The Seattle Seahawks have won Super Bowl LX, defeating the New England Patriots 29-13 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, on Sunday.

Kenneth Walker III was named the game's Most Valuable Player, for good reason — the running back managed to get 135 rushing yards and 27 attempts, racking up significant yardage for the Seahawks.







Bad Bunny is on a roll. The Latin superstar just made history with his Grammy win for Album of the Year and will keep his historic streak going when he delivers the first Super Bowl halftime headlining show in Spanish on Sunday. Bad Bunny has already promised “the world will dance” in a preview trailer, so it's bound to be one hell of a blowout bash as the star celebrates his beloved Puerto Rico on the national stage.

But what's a party without a killer guest list? During his “No Me Quiero Ir De Aqui” residency in P.R. last year, the star invited a star-studded Rolodex of past collaborators and famous friends each night. It only makes sense he would bring some of those same folks, and even bigger stars, out for his big moment at the Super Bowl. We're not sure what he's going to do yet: Given his ICE speeches at the Grammys, it's likely he could get political. He could also dedicate the entire performance to Puerto Rico. But while we're guessing, here's a list of potential performers we think Bad Bunny may bring out on Sunday.

Hoping that these aliens are more Grogu from The Mandalorian and less the Xenomoprh from Alien.

Last week, former US President Barack Obama jumped onto a podcast with Brian Tyler Cohen in which they discussed a wide array of topics. One clip in particular from the podcast went “out of this world” viral after host Brian Tyler Cohen asked former president Obama “are aliens real?”. You can catch the clip below.

A post shared by Barack Obama (@barackobama)

The answer made headlines with many commenters astounded by the former presidents honesty. With many interpreting his answer that he had seen legitimate proof of alien life off earth. Which, understandably had many people losing their minds and freaking out. The clip has gone so viral that the former president has even had to release a clarifying comment to calm people down.

“I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it's gotten attention let me clarify. Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we've been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!” – Barack Obama

Well there we have it. Obama believes has not seen any solid evidence of aliens or little green men in Area 51, but confidently feels that the universe is so grand that it is all but a certainty life off earth exists.

What do you think? Do you think the aliens made him say these comments after they got mad at him for exposing them. We'll never know.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Psychic","Psychic Uri Geller claims Obama admitted UFOs","https://cybernews.com/news/uri-geller-barack-obama-ufo-area51/","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 14:48:26 GMT","

Prominent psychic Uri Geller has made a bold claim by attributing a massive Area 51 disclosure to former President Barack Obama. Geller also discussed a mysterious UFO-related trip to Korea he made with the US forces over 50 years ago.

Uri Geller, who has enjoyed an over-five-decade career as a magician, psychic, and illusionist, posted on X with the core claim: “Barack Obama has just admitted that aliens are real!” stating it as a definitive fact and specifying they are not at Area 51.

In the video accompanying a lengthy X post, Geller referenced Obama's recent podcast remarks in which the former president said that “Area 51 could be a good conspiracy.” 

Geller then said that, in actual fact, aliens were taken to the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, just 6.5 miles away from Washington, DC.

Geller says that a UFO crashed around Area 51, but that injured and disfigured aliens were taken from the site, and that “Some were mangled, some were wounded, some were intact.”

In a video accompanying his X post, Geller also referenced a trip he made 50 years ago to  Korea on an American military mission, though it's not clear why he would be employed in such a case.

On an appearance with Bryan Tyler Cohen, Obama participated in a quick-fire question format, with the leading question of “Are aliens real?” to which Obama responded: “They're real, but I haven't seen them.”

On the podcast, he also clarified more specifically that aliens are not being kept at Area 51.

“There's no underground facility, unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.”

He later clarified in an Instagram post:


Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we've been visited by aliens are low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!


A post shared by Barack Obama (@barackobama)

The mere mention of the word conspiracy seems to have prompted Geller to let loose with everything he's accumulated, bringing out old photographs from his personal museum and attempting to jump on the disclosure bandwagon.

What's confusing in Geller's original X post and follow-up is a photograph and explanation of a trip he took 50 years ago to Korea.

In his video, Geller purported: “I've been told many times not to talk about things to do with Korea. I don't care anymore.”

“The American army flew me undercover to look for tunnels. But that wasn't the main reason.”

Here I am in South Korea , I was flown there with an American army helicopter Surinder by Korean officers and soldiers, to check out tunnels that North Korea dug to get to the ginormous UFO which is guarded 24 hrs a day: pic.twitter.com/vr2jwiazQQ

He explains that a huge UFO was there, so large that the forces couldn't move it. Geller claims that the huge stones surrounding the site (which is allegedly still there) absorbed the cosmic forces.

The reaction from the X community was highly skeptical, with one user suggesting that his animated photo undermined his credibility.

We can also factor in that by opening with a UFO explanation in the vicinity of Area 51, coupled with an animated video, then shifting back 50 years to a trip to Korea, even if there were some truth to what Geller is suggesting, his communication style is highly conflatory.

Washington: An American filmmaker and conservative activist who claims Barack Obama's real father was a communist poet and that Michelle Obama “is not who she pretends to be” will address a conference in Australia hosted by rising right-wing lobby group Advance.

Joel Gilbert is a regular contributor to far-right conspiracy theory media outlets such as Alex Jones' Infowars and fake news website The Gateway Pundit, where he is currently pushing the claim that a candidate for governor of California is ineligible for that office.

One of Gilbert's films explores the urban legend that the Beatles' Paul McCartney died in 1966 and was replaced by a lookalike, though he now calls it a “mockumentary”. He has also made a conspiratorial film about the killing of African-American teenager Trayvon Martin.

Gilbert is being flown into Australia by Advance to be a key speaker at a conference in Sydney, alongside former prime minister Tony Abbott and Liberal MP Moira Deeming. He is billed to make a half-hour speech on Saturday morning titled: “The quiet coup: how judicial politicisation threatens democratic society.”

Gilbert told this masthead he will discuss a trend by Democrats since Obama to appoint “radical judges” in the judicial system, and a parallel “drift” in Australia, whereby courts were increasingly “asked to adjudicate issues about immigration and health mandates and environmental regulations, and use executive discretion”.

He confirmed Advance was paying for his travel to Australia. The conference is called “Evolve: Because being right isn't enough”, and is described in an email to subscribers as “the political event of the year”.

Questioned on his claims that Obama's real father was Frank Marshall Davis, a communist poet and friend of Obama's grandfather, Gilbert said: “I don't have the DNA, but certainly the photos bear it out.”

The film was “more about Davis's ideological influence on Obama”, he said, repeating an unproven claim that Obama was raised by Davis. Gilbert rejected the label of “conspiracy theorist”, saying the term was used to dismiss people's research rather than engage in the facts.

Advance did not respond to inquiries about how much it was paying Gilbert to appear, and whether that was the best use of donors' money.

Disclosure records show Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting was the lobby group's largest donor in 2024-25, making two payments totalling $895,000. Rinehart was contacted for comment.

While in Australia, Gilbert will also appear at NSW Parliament for a screening of his 2018 film Trump: The Art of the Insult – an event being sponsored by Libertarian Party MP John Ruddick.

Gilbert has an ongoing association with Australia. His film about Al Gore – in which he interviews an AI version of the former Democratic vice president – made its “world premiere” at the 2024 Conservative Political Action Conference in Brisbane. Gilbert says Ruddick gave him the idea for the film.

In January, while appearing on far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones's program Infowars, Gilbert called the Albanese government “radical far-left” and spoke disparagingly about Muslim immigration.

“Australia has a radical far-left Labor government. They have the same in the UK … It's hard to get a united western front when half of your best allies are far-left and believe in this idea of DEI and inclusivity,” he said.

“They don't really understand the big picture of what it means to bring large populations of Muslims into your country, and not understanding that they have a different way of life, a different political goal and a different value system than your society does.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Unsolved+Mysteries","Chilling Unsolved Mysteries That Still Haunt Small Town America","https://www.grunge.com/2092240/chilling-unsolved-mysteries-still-haunt-small-town-america/","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 13:07:00 GMT","

If you grew up in a small town, you probably remember ""the story,"" the pet legend most small towns have. It can be a crime, an alleged haunting, or even something more light-hearted like the exploits of an early or prominent resident, but many, many small towns have a particular tale that becomes an informal cornerstone of civic identity.

Some towns are fortunate enough to have an intriguing and long-enough-ago story that lets the tourism boards cash in, but other, less lucky settlements are forced to contend with sadder, more disquieting moments in their histories. Unexplained deaths and vanishings can be particularly difficult for a community to move on from — in addition, of course, to the lack of closure confronted by those who loved the victims — since by their very nature, these unresolved, unsolved stories lack an ending. Without knowing what happened, those left behind are doomed to keep turning possibilities over and over, looking for a neglected angle that might finally bring answers.

Initially, October 24, 1961, seemed like a pleasantly normal day for Lincoln, Massachusetts, homemaker Joan Risch. Her husband was out of town, and Joan spent the morning running errands before returning to have lunch and put the younger of her two children down for a nap. After that, it gets strange: Risch took her daughter and a neighborhood friend over to the friend's house without telling his parents. Later that afternoon, a passerby saw Risch in her driveway, appearing disoriented, but didn't check to see what was up. 

That was the last confirmed sighting of Joan Risch. Her daughter eventually returned to find the phone cord ripped out of the wall and blood in the kitchen, which the child thankfully misidentified as red paint. Someone had half-heartedly tried to clean up the blood, which was later found throughout the house and outside, and was a significant — but not fatal — amount to have lost, and left handprints that did not match Risch. Her young son, upstairs, was unharmed. A confused and apparently bleeding woman was seen walking along a road outside town that afternoon, but again, no one offered help.

Three major theories have been posited for Risch's disappearance: an attacker, a medical episode, or accidental injury of some kind, or a deliberate disappearance. Risch had endured an apparently traumatic childhood and had pursued a career in publishing before her marriage, factors that, along with her voracious consumption of crime and mystery books, suggest to some that she may have chosen to vanish.

In the wee hours of August 23, 1987, the crew of a train passing through Alexander, Arkansas, had the horrific experience of seeing human forms lying on the track and being unable to stop the locomotive before it struck them. The bodies were those of Kevin Ives and Don Henry, local teenagers and close friends, who had been out hunting together the previous night. The train crew reported seeing a tarp over the bodies as well as a gun; police reported no tarp but did find a busted-up rifle.

Investigators couldn't, or didn't, determine whether Ives and Henry were already dead when the train struck them. The medical examiner ruled the deaths suicides over protests from each set of parents; this same examiner later proposed that the boys may simply have smoked so much pot they passed out on the tracks and never heard the fatal train. This ""theory"" had been put to the grieving families despite no reliable test for THC having yet been conducted on the remains, and in apparent ignorance of the titanic amount of weed someone would have to consume to result in sleeping through being hit by a train. 

Conspiracy theories continued to blossom, encouraged by the murder of two potential witnesses, accidental death of a third, and disappearance of a fourth. Not to mention, the ongoing investigation meant the manner of their deaths, which were originally ruled suicides, changed to accidental, then undetermined, then probable homicide. And since it was Arkansas, the Clintons were eventually attached to the more fervent speculations. Recent reports indicate that the boys may have been murdered after accidentally witnessing a drug transaction, but this has not yet been confirmed.

Antigo, Wisconsin, teenager Kayla Berg was going through a rebellious phase, a common feature of the transition to adulthood, but one that was racking her parents' nerves. But on August 11, 2009, there seemed to be no immediate additional reason to worry about Kayla. She was in a good mood, keeping her parents better informed of her movements, and had plans to meet a friend later in the evening after the friend's McDonald's shift ended.

Berg never made that date. Eventually, it came out that she had accepted a ride from a local guy named Kevin Kielcheski, part of her extended social group, even though he was 24 to Berg's 15. He said he had dropped her off at her boyfriend's house (Miguel Marrero was 19 at the time which is ... better than 24, but not great), except that didn't make sense. Marrero's old house was in such bad shape that it had been condemned, so the Marreros were staying elsewhere, which his girlfriend clearly knew. Nevertheless, Kielcheski's story is that he took Berg to the empty house and, like everyone, never saw her again.

In October 2009, Berg's disappearance was connected to a viral video in which a man pretends to have finally gotten a girlfriend by capturing a young woman. Though the short was staged, the tied-up actress looked enough like Berg that the YouTubers were investigated by the FBI and absolved of everything except bad taste.

In 1905, the 20th Century Limited was one of the fastest trains in the world, shuttling well-heeled passengers between New York City and Chicago in a mere 16.5 hours. So when one of these trains slammed into a freight depot in then-rural Mentor, Ohio, during the evening of June 21, 1905, it did so at some 70 miles an hour, smashing up both the train and the depot and igniting a hot-burning fire fed by the wood-framed train cars. When the smoke cleared, 21 people lay dead from the impact and fire combined.

The problem was that a switch had been activated that diverted the train from the main tracks that led through town and, ultimately, toward New York. A prior train had thundered eastward through the station some 45 minutes before the disaster, and apparently, sometime between the two trains' arrivals at the Mentor Station, someone had intentionally thrown the switch and locked it in place, ensuring the devastating collision. Investigators found the switch undamaged after the incident, but with nearby lights doused. There seemed no way this sabotage could have been accidental, but no one was ever arrested or publicly accused of responsibility.

Despite only living for about 27 years, Mississippi bluesman Robert Johnson managed to build two enduring legends that would outlive him. The first is that he acquired his musical talent in a pact with the devil, selling his soul at a crossroads and taking an innate ability to play the blues as payment. The second legend is about his early death: Was Robert Johnson murdered, and if so, by whom?

Johnson had a hard life — a widower living in Mississippi under segregation, he certainly wouldn't have needed the devil to explain heartbreak to him — and coped with his favorite two vices, whiskey and women. One of these glasses of whiskey allegedly contained strychnine, a potent plant-derived poison.

The strychnine explanation of Johnson's premature death is broadly but not universally accepted. With no newspaper report and no apparent official investigation, there's no good firsthand evidence of what happened. Some versions of the story match his reported symptoms and timeline of strychnine poisoning, and some don't: strychnine kills quickly, conflicting with versions that have Johnson suffering for days. (Some stories feature another poison, often naphthalene extracted from mothballs, and some say he was stabbed.) The Skeptical Enquirer posits he wasn't murdered at all, but suffered poor health that was exacerbated by alcohol abuse. The death certificate blames syphilis, but this seems to be a common answer given by racist coroners to avoid investigating Black deaths. The story of Johnson's maybe-murder ultimately says more about race in America and the power of a legend than it reveals how the bluesman actually died.

You might well expect that being the attorney for a figure within the Manson Family would be, at best, somewhat taxing. Ronald Hughes, a novice trial attorney who had pulled the difficult assignment of defending Leslie Van Houten, was so stressed by the trial and the behavior of the Mansonites  that over the long Thanksgiving weekend of 1970, he decided to take a little trip to try to unclench his jaw, driving up north of Los Angeles to a rural area, Sespe, that boasted some hot springs. 

Hughes was never seen alive again. The trial went on with a pinch hitter taking over Van Houten's defense, while investigators looks for the missing lawyer near where he had last been seen and sifted reported of similarly burly, blond-bearded men seen about the West. And then in March, Hughes' remains were discovered: naked but well-preserved from the cold and with no clear evidence of foul play. 

Hughes may have been murdered, allegedly poisoned, on Manson's orders, because he had tried to act independently during the trial and attempted to prevent Van Houten from testifying in Manson's defense. That said, the area in which Hughes had been staying had been hit by a surprise rainstorm over the holiday weekend, resulting in several deaths from flash flooding, and Hughes might have simply been a victim of severe weather.

Jack Madruga, Bill Sterling, Gary Mathias, Ted Weiher, and Jackie Huett formed a tight friend group. All had some form of developmental disability or mental challenge, but with the support of their families and each other, all were thriving, and it was perfectly normal and well within their capabilities to take an evening trip up to Chico, California, to watch a basketball game on February 24, 1978. After the game, they bought snacks to get them through the hour-ish drive back to their homes in Marysville and Yuba City. The store clerk was the last person to see the friends alive, barring a confused account by a man who'd had a heart attack trying to get his car out of the snow but thought he had seen a group of people pass with flashlights as he drifted in and out of consciousness.

When the men hadn't returned by the morning, their families reported them missing, but it wasn't until June that the first of them would be found, in a rural area along a mountain road — off their planned route home. Weiher's remains were discovered in a camp trailer maintained by the forest service, with frostbitten feet and a full beard indicating that he had been alive at least for some time after he was last seen. Madruga's, Sterling's, and Huett's remains were found in the nearby woods over the following days. Mathias was never found, and a 2023 letter from October 2020 credits his death to suspected foul play.

Marcia Moore, the daughter of a wealthy family, had been lucky enough to have the resources to pursue her occult interest over the course of her life. She explored astrology, metaphysics, and astral projection — and marriage, married to her fourth husband before her 1979 disappearance. On the freezing cold night of January 14, the day before a planned road trip, she vanished from her home in a rural area north of Seattle, with no trace until part of her skull was found in the nearby woods two years later. 

Almost anything could have happened to Moore. A heavy ketamine user, she may have overdosed, intentionally or not, or been disoriented enough that she wandered into the snowy woods to her doom. Her fourth husband, Dr. Howard Alltounian, was her ketamine source and a suspect in a series of sexual crimes, adding to the inevitable suspicion that settled on him as her spouse. Alltounian, for his part, credited her disappearance to ""dematerialization."" With the aid of ketamine and LSD, Moore allegedly planned to leave behind her physical form, perhaps returning in a new incarnation to take back up with Alltounian.

In a bizarre coda, Moore's son would also die under inexplicable circumstances. Christopher Roof's remains were found in rural Maine in 2010, but only identified in 2021. As in his mother's case, the cause and manner of Roof's death remain unknown.

Douglas Crofut died in July 1981 of a massive exposure to radiation from either iridium-192 or cobalt-60, two dangerous but industrially useful radioactive isotopes. As an experienced oilfield worker, Crofut would have known how dangerous it would have been to handle such materials without proper protective equipment, and yet he presented at an Oklahoma emergency room with catastrophic radiation burns to his arm and chest, described as so severe that the flesh was visibly eaten away. During the six excruciating months that Crofut lingered, slowly dying as more of his tissue succumbed to the effects of the radiation, he maintained that he had no idea how he had been exposed.

Investigators theorized, from the position of the damage to Crofut's body, that he had carried the material in his front shirt pocket, but this didn't answer questions like ""where did he get it?"" and ""why would a person do such a thing?"" An iridium source was reported missing and later recovered in the general area, but Crofut had no clear connection to the company or individuals involved. Crofut had significant personal problems, including unemployment and a criminal record of petty offenses that were seemingly connected to his alcohol use, but whether these demons had led him to act in reckless or self-destructive ways around such dangerous substances cannot be answered.

On the icy night of December 12, 1992, the car carrying young couple Arnold Archambeau and Ruby Bruguier slid off the road and turned over in a ditch outside Lake Andes, South Dakota. Archambeau and Bruguier had been drinking, as had their passenger, Tracy Dion, but thankfully none of the three was seriously injured. Dion watched as Archambeau and Bruguier walked away from the crash site ... and into oblivion. Their remains were found nearby three months later, on consecutive days. They could not have been missed by earlier searches, and though both had apparently died of exposure, they were not at equivalent stages of decomposition, with Archambeau's body reportedly in much better condition than Bruguier's.

The official story is that Archambeau and Bruguier did not die of foul play, but that someone did move their bodies postmortem to where they were found. A witness reported seeing Archambeau over the New Year's holiday and passed a lie detector test, hinting at his survival at least for three weeks but giving little additional information. Also unexplained: Archambeau was found with unidentified keys that did not fit any vehicle or building to which he was known to have access.

Popular Mason City, Iowa, news anchor Jodi Huisentruit was late for work on the very early morning of June 27, 1995, a rare misstep for the ambitious journalist. When her boss called, she said she was on her way, but even though she only lived about a mile away, she never made the broadcast. Police called to carry out a wellness check found alarming signs of a struggle by Huisentruit's car, still parked at her apartment complex: Her car key was bent, and her work heels, jewelry, and hair dryer formed a suggestive and distressing debris trail on the ground nearby. There was no blood, and no witness has ever come forward — nor has Huisentruit ever been seen again.

In the intervening years, two persons of interest in Huisentruit's disappearance have died, one by suicide as he awaited trial for a different murder and the other having protested his innocence for decades. Huisentruit herself was declared legally dead in 2001. Huisentruit's former colleagues in the news, along with the journalistic community more generally, have kept her memory and public interest in the case active, but so far, no satisfactory explanation for what happened to the young anchorwoman has ever emerged.","{'href': 'https://www.grunge.com', 'title': 'grunge.com'}","other"

Veteran broadcaster Anderson Cooper said Monday that he is leaving his role as a correspondent on CBS News' ""60 Minutes"" after nearly 20 years.

In a statement, Cooper said he intended to spend more time focusing on his CNN gig, and his family.

His exit comes at an already turbulent time for CBS News under its new editor in chief, Bari Weiss.

Here are what some of the leading voices in media are saying about Cooper's ""60 Minutes"" departure.

Sports broadcaster Keith Olbermann shared the news about Cooper's departure on his Bluesky account, posting: ""Anderson Cooper has left the sinking ship that is Idiot Bari Weiss's New Stormfront CBS.""

Olbermann later added, ""Now, people will only be able to NOT watch AC on cnn.""

Cooper has worked at CNN since 2001, where he is a political commentator and hosts the ""Anderson Cooper 360"" show.

Brian Lowry, a longtime media columnist and current Hollywood correspondent at Status News, a media newsletter, wrote on X: ""Have worked around Hollywood long enough to know nobody ever really leaves a job to spend more time with their family.""

Tom Jones, senior media writer at The Poynter Report, wrote in his newsletter that Cooper's departure marked ""the end of a journalism era.""

Jones said that Cooper's exit ""certainly adds more uncertainty in a news division that is very much in flux under relatively new editor-in-chief Bari Weiss.""

He added: ""It also raises questions about '60 Minutes,' the previous gold standard of TV news shows."" 

Lydia Polgreen, a New York Times opinion writer and the former editor in chief of HuffPost, posted to X on Tuesday: ""I don't watch much TV news, but @andersoncooper is in a league of his own as a television journalist. A huge loss for 60 Minutes.""

CNN's chief media analyst, Brian Stelter, wrote in his ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter Tuesday that there are open questions about which other correspondents might leave, ""and on what terms.""

            Stephen Colbert taped a “Late Show” interview with James Talarico, a candidate in the Democratic Senate primary in Texas, on Monday. But CBS lawyers intervened before the interview could air on TV.
    


            “We were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,” Colbert told his viewers Monday night.
    


            The shocking action seems to be a result of the Trump administration's intensifying pressure against broadcast TV networks.
    


            The FCC, which regulates local stations operated by broadcasters like CBS, recently issued new guidance about an old regulation known as the “equal time” rule.
    


            The rule requires stations to give equal airtime to all legally qualified candidates for public office — if one is featured, his or her rivals have to be given time, too.
    


            There are big exemptions for news coverage, and for the past two decades that exemption has also been thought to apply to late night and daytime talk shows.
    


            But FCC chair Brendan Carr is rejecting that thinking. Last month, he said stations should no longer assume that shows like Colbert's are exempted from the rule.
    


            “If you're fake news, you're not going to qualify for the bona fide news exemption,” Carr said at a press conference in January.
    


            As Carr's use of the phrase “fake news” indicates, he is a staunch ally of President Trump. He has been harshly critical of talk shows like ABC's “The View” that feature liberal political commentary.
    


            But the FCC's enforcement powers are limited. The lone Democratic commissioner at the FCC, Anna Gomez, said Carr's claims were misleading: “The FCC has not adopted any new regulation, interpretation, or Commission-level policy altering the long-standing news exemption or equal time framework.”
    


            A source at the FCC reiterated that point, saying, “Once again here, the threat is the point.”
    


            “The point is to force shows and networks to second-guess their decisions in light of this ‘new' guidance,” the source told CNN on condition of anonymity.
    


            After Talarico appeared on “The View” earlier this month, Reuters reported that the FCC was opening an investigation into the possible “equal time” violation.
    


            Gomez predicted that no meaningful action would be taken, though, and called it another instance of “government intimidation” against the media.
    


            Colbert's comments on Monday night indicate that he sees the same thing happening.
    


            “Let's just call this what it is,” he said. “Donald Trump's administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV. Because all Trump does is watch TV.”
    


            He also had pointed words for Carr: “Sir, you're chairman of the FCC, so FCC you.”
    


            Colbert's show posted the Talarico interview on YouTube as an “online-only exclusive” since the FCC rules don't apply to streaming.
    


            In the interview, Talarico called out the FCC's conduct, albeit not by name.
    


            Talarico said Republicans “ran against cancel culture, and now they're trying to control what we watch, what we say, what we read. And this is the most dangerous kind of cancel culture, the kind that comes from the top.”
    


            “They went after ‘The View' because I went on there,” Talarico continued. “They went after Jimmy Kimmel for telling a joke they didn't like. They went after you for telling the truth about Paramount's bribe to Donald Trump.”
    


            Last year the previous owners of Paramount paid $16 million to resolve an extraordinary lawsuit filed by Trump over a “60 Minutes” news report he didn't like.
    


            The funds were allocated to Trump's future presidential library, mirroring a settlement agreement that Disney's ABC struck with Trump earlier.
    


            Critics of the settlement described it as a bribe because Paramount was trying to win Trump administration approval for a media mega-merger at the time.
    


            The FCC allowed the merger to move forward just a few weeks after Paramount struck the settlement deal, though Carr insisted the matters were not connected.
    


            CBS and Carr have not responded to CNN's requests for comment about Colbert's on-air assertions Monday night.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Can you buy a country?","https://www.rt.com/news/632664-can-you-buy-country/","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 13:26:00 GMT","

When US President Donald Trump revived the idea of buying Greenland – and refused to rule out stronger measures if Denmark declined – the reaction across Europe was swift and indignant. The proposal was framed as an anachronism: a throwback to imperial horse-trading that modern international politics had supposedly outgrown.

But the outrage obscures an uncomfortable historical reality. The United States was not only forged through revolution and war; it was also built through transactions – large-scale territorial purchases concluded at moments when the balance of power left the seller with limited options. From continental expanses to strategic islands, Washington has repeatedly expanded its reach by writing checks backed by leverage.

If the idea of buying land now sounds jarring, it is worth recalling that some of the largest such deals helped shape the United States into the country we know today. To understand why the Greenland debate resonates so strongly, we should revisit the major acquisitions that redrew the American map.

French explorers ventured into the Mississippi Valley in the late 17th century, claiming new territories and naming this vast expanse Louisiana after King Louis XIV. In 1718, they established New Orleans at the mouth of the Mississippi, gradually populating the colony not just with French settlers but also through policies enacted by Louis that granted freedom to children born of unions between white settlers and black slaves. Still, the population remained sparse. The region's bad climate and complex relationships with Native Americans made settlement difficult.

As a result, France didn't particularly value this territory, despite its huge size: French Louisiana encompassed not just modern-day Louisiana but, either partially or wholly, the modern states of Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Colorado, Wyoming, North and South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, Texas, New Mexico, and even parts of Canada. Despite this, however, it was hard to find a Frenchman beyond New Orleans. 

In 1763, following the Seven Years' War, France ceded Louisiana to Spain. The Spanish administration didn't oppress the French settlers and managed the colony quite competently. However, much of this enormous land remained largely uninhabited aside from the Native Americans. The total number of settlers, including black slaves, amounted to several tens of thousands of people. 

By the early 19th century, Europe saw many changes. Napoleon regained control of Louisiana, aiming to revive France's overseas empire. However, this ambition crumbled when his attempt to restore French rule in Haiti failed. A force sent by Napoleon was decimated by black rebels and succumbed to tropical diseases.

Against this backdrop, Napoleon quickly realized that he could not hold onto Louisiana, and the English or Americans would easily seize it. As for the US, it had mixed feelings about Louisiana; controlling the mouth of the Mississippi was crucial, but Americans were also wary of potential French aggression. Finally, US President Thomas Jefferson initiated negotiations with France for the purchase of Louisiana.

Napoleon saw this as a big opportunity. He recognized that he could get real money by selling the territory which France didn't really need and couldn't control. 

Jefferson and the American side initially aimed to purchase only New Orleans and its surrounding areas, offering $10 million. However, the French surprised their American counterparts: they asked for $15 million, but as part of the deal, offered vast territories stretching up to Canada. However, beyond New Orleans, the French essentially sold the freedom to claim land inhabited by the Native Americans. The French had very little control over this vast territory, and the Native Americans didn't even understand what the sale entailed. In fact, aside from the Native Americans, the vast territory was inhabited by only about 60,000 settlers, including black slaves. 

Regardless, the deal was concluded, and America's territory effectively doubled overnight. Robert Livingston, one of the Founding Fathers and then US ambassador to France, famously declared, “We have lived long, but this is the noblest work of our whole lives… From this day the United States take their place among the powers of the first rank.”

In the case of Louisiana, both parties were pleased with the agreement. However, when it came to Florida, the seller wasn't particularly thrilled. 

Spain had discovered Florida in 1513. At that time, however, Spain didn't see much value in this territory, and early colonization efforts were sluggish; it was mainly used as a military outpost. In the 18th century, Britain seized Florida from Spain, but during the American War of Independence, Spain regained control of its former colony. Similar to the situation with France and Louisiana, however, formal ownership did not equate to actual authority.

Meanwhile, American settlers flooded into Florida. Conflicts smoldered at the border; American settlers encroached upon Spanish lands, turning Florida into a constant battleground involving the US, the Native Americans, and occasionally the British. Spain struggled to respond effectively to these incursions. Furthermore, between 1807 and 1814, Spain was embroiled in a grueling war against Napoleon, during which the French temporarily occupied mainland Spain.

After the war, Spain was devastated and unable to fend off the Seminole Indians who were raiding the colony. Frustrated by the issues caused by the Seminoles, the Americans occupied most of Florida, claiming that the land had essentially been abandoned.

Spain decided that any gain was better than losing the territory outright. America officially compensated Spain $5 million for the damage resulting from its own invasions. By 1819, Spain had no choice but to cede Florida. 

The 19th century was the age of colonial empires. But the US acquired the Virgin Islands in the 20th century, during the First World War. 

Denmark isn't the first country that comes to mind when discussing the struggle for control over the Caribbean Sea. But in 1672, the Danish West India Company annexed the small island of St. Thomas, followed shortly by the island of St. John. Denmark may have been an unusual colonizer, but its ambitions were quite ordinary. The Danes established sugar plantations and relied on slave labor. Sugar became the backbone of the Virgin Islands' economy. However, by the mid-19th century, global market prices plummeted, prompting the Danes to consider getting rid of this asset.

Meanwhile, America was interested in acquiring the port at St. Thomas, but at the time, the deal fell through. The US decided that Alaska was a better investment and purchased it from Russia, which didn't need the remote northern territory. For Russia, Alaska was far away and hard to defend; plus, the Russians had already reaped some quick profits from it. So the Virgin Islands remained under Danish control until the 20th century. 

During WWI, the Americans revisited the idea of acquiring the Virgin Islands. Officially, the US was concerned that Germany might seize Denmark and take over the islands, using them as submarine bases. It sounded more like a pretext, since building a base so close to the US would have been no easy task, and supplying it would've been even harder. Regardless, the US decided to acquire the Virgin Islands and Denmark received an offer it couldn't ignore.

US President Woodrow Wilson sent a clear warning: if Denmark didn't sell the islands, America would occupy them – of course, merely to prevent them from falling into German hands. To soften the blow, Wilson sweetened the deal with an offer of $25 million in gold, which was about half of Denmark's annual budget at the time.

Initially, Copenhagen hesitated, especially with the economic significance of the islands growing after the opening of the Panama Canal. But the Americans made it clear that the islands would fall under US control eventually, either the easy way or the hard way. Denmark held a referendum and handed over the islands to the US. 

In August 1916, the two sides agreed on the sale. As part of this agreement, the US acknowledged Denmark's rights to Greenland. By 1917, all formalities were settled, and the islands changed flags. Water Island was sold separately in 1944.

Interestingly, after WWII, the US once again turned its attention to Greenland, seeking to acquire it in the context of the Cold War. Denmark refused, though US military bases were established there. At one point, a strategic bomber carrying nuclear weapons crashed above Greenland – a fact the Danish public was wisely kept in the dark about.

In that sense, Donald Trump's proposals are less unprecedented than they appear. The United States has expanded its territory through purchases for more than two centuries. Sometimes the seller was relieved to dispose of a distant or costly possession; at other times, agreement followed mounting pressure and strategic imbalance. Expansion through transaction was never an exception in American history – it was a recurring method.

Trump's interest in Greenland fits squarely into that historical pattern. Like his predecessors, he appears drawn to the symbolism of enlarging America's strategic footprint. Of course, a better idea might be to wait until Denmark finds itself in a crisis and then come out with a bag full of cash.

But the wait may be long, and patience is certainly not Trump's strong suit.

A shooter unleashed a flurry of bullets during a Rhode Island youth hockey game, killing two people and injuring three others, in an attack that was cut short when a spectator stepped in to help stop the tragedy, authorities said.

Investigators had spoken to nearly 100 witnesses as of Monday evening as they attempt to piece together what happened earlier that afternoon inside the Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket, a few miles outside Providence.

Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves said Monday that the shooter died from an apparent self-inflicted gun wound, though authorities are still investigating.

Goncalves credited an unnamed “good Samaritan” who intervened, bringing the attack “to a swift end.” She did not provide details.

It is not entirely clear what precipitated the shooting, who was targeted or why. The game was livestreamed by LiveBarn, a streaming platform for youth sporting events, whose videos have been shared on social media showing players on the ice as popping sounds are heard. Chaos quickly unfolds as players on benches dive for cover, those on the ice frantically skate toward exits and fans flee their seats.

LiveBarn's social media account has been issuing warnings to those who shared the video that they do not have permission to do so. An e-mail to LiveBarn seeking comment was sent Tuesday.

“It appears that this was a targeted event, that it may be a family dispute,” Goncalves said. Authorities said both people who died were adults but have not released the identities of the victims.

Goncalves identified the shooter as Robert Dorgan, who she said also went by the name Roberta Esposito, who was born in 1969.

Dorgan was an active employee at General Dynamics Bath Iron Works, a ship building in Bath, Maine, that contracts with the U.S. Navy, David Hench, a spokesperson for the shipyard, said Tuesday. Hench did not immediately respond to questions about Dorgan's job title or how long Dorgan worked at the shipyard.

Monday's shooting came nearly two months after Rhode Island was rocked by a shooting at Brown University that left two students dead and wounded nine others, as well as a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor. Authorities later found Claudio Neves Valente, 48, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at a New Hampshire storage facility.

“Our state is grieving again,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said in a statement. “As governor, a parent, and a former coach, my heart breaks for the victims, families, students, and everyone impacted by the devastating shooting at Lynch Arena in Pawtucket.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin to leave agency","https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/17/politics/tricia-mclaughlin-homeland-security-spokesperson-leaving","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 16:39:04 GMT","


            The Department of Homeland Security's top spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, is stepping down, a Trump administration official told CNN.
    


            McLaughlin is expected to leave her position as assistant secretary next week.
    


            Her departure comes on the heels of high-profile shootings in Minnesota, where conflicting accounts called into question the department's credibility. McLaughlin was one of the agency's most vocal — and, apart from Secretary Kristi Noem, most visible — defenders, making appearances across news networks to defend President Donald Trump's mass deportation agenda and taking to social media to blast reporting on the agency.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment.
    


            McLaughlin started to plan her departure in December but stayed in the aftermath of the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis, according to a source familiar. Her plans to leave the administration were first reported by Politico.
    


            Even before the killings of Pretti and Good last month, DHS' public affairs office faced questions about its credibility after several incidents in which McLaughlin and the agency made claims that were later undermined by video or statements from local officials.
    


            The agency's credibility issues, combined with its officers' use of aggressive tactics to carry out Trump's deportation mandate, have led to a drop in public opinion on DHS and its components. A recent Ipsos poll showed that 62% of Americans think Immigration and Customs Enforcement's efforts have gone “too far.”
    


            The agency's conduct is a central sticking point in the partial government shutdown that began last week after Congress hit an impasse to negotiate reforms in DHS' immigration operations.
    


            During the first Trump administration, McLaughlin worked as the chief of staff for nuclear arms control at the State Department and in the public affairs office at the Treasury Department.
    


            She went on to work as a spokesperson for Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, and later, for Vivek Ramaswamy's 2024 presidential campaign.
    


            McLaughlin came under scrutiny last year after ProPublica reported that a firm run by her husband was subcontracted to produce an advertising campaign for DHS in a $200 million deal.
    


            McLaughlin told ProPublica at the time that DHS had no visibility into which subcontractors were selected and that she recused herself because of the conflict of interest.
    


            She is the latest top DHS official to leave about a year into the new administration. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Deputy Director Madison Sheahan announced last month she would also step down from her position to run for Congress in her native Ohio.

            Four students wounded in the shooting at a Georgia high school in September 2024 testified on Tuesday about the harrowing moments they realized they had been shot.
    


            Melany Delira-Castaneda, the first to testify, was 15 and in her ninth grade math class at Apalachee High School when her ear began ringing and she smelled smoke, she testified. She stood up and turned toward the door and saw Colt Gray, then 14, pointing a firearm into the classroom and firing indiscriminately, she said.
    


            “I didn't know I was shot, but I was. My body just told me to hold my arm,” Melany, now 16, said quietly through tears. “I was holding my arm and I hid between a pillar … between (the teacher's) smartboard and my desk.”
    


            After the shooting, police took her into the hallway, and Melany saw two students who had been killed lying on the floor. She ultimately went to the hospital with a gunshot wound in her left shoulder and continues to face emotional challenges.
    


            “I feel like, just seeing what I saw that day just sticks with me, and not being able to trust certain people,” she said of the shooting's effect on her.
    


            Melany was one of several teenage shooting victims who testified Tuesday in the trial of Colin Gray, the father of Colt Gray, on charges of murder and manslaughter. Prosecutors allege Colin Gray bought his son the AR-15-style rifle used in the shooting despite previous warnings that his son was a danger to others, actions that constitute criminally reckless conduct.
    


            The trial began Monday with opening statements and testimony from teachers, police and parents at the school that day who spoke about the horror of the attack, which left two students and two teachers dead. Nine other people were injured.
    


            Colin Gray has pleaded not guilty to nearly 30 charges, including two counts each of second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. His attorney said in opening statements Monday that Colin Gray was unaware his son was planning the shooting and had taken steps to try to get him help.
    


            “When someone conceals a plan, deceives the people around them, acts independently, the law does not allow us to pretend that the people left behind should've seen through all of it,” Hobbs said.
    


            Colin Gray's trial is part of a broader push to hold more people accountable for a school shooting, including the shooter's parents and responding law enforcement officers.
    


            This case bears close similarities to the trials of James and Jennifer Crumbley, whose then-15-year-old son killed four students in 2021 at his high school in Oxford, Michigan. The Crumbley parents were each convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison. Their son was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
    


            Colin Gray has remained behind bars since his arrest a day after the shooting. If convicted, he faces 10 to 30 years in prison on each murder charge and 1 to 10 years on each manslaughter charge.
    


            Colt Gray ultimately surrendered to police and has admitted to the shooting, according to authorities. Now 16, he has pleaded not guilty to 55 felony counts, including four counts of malice murder. A trial date has not been set.
    


            While the crux of the trial is on what Colin Gray did and didn't do leading up to the shooting, the students' testimony Tuesday laid out its dramatic violence and high emotional stakes.
    

Jurors watched surveillance videos and heard a harrowing 911 call on the first day of testimony in the trial of Colin Gray, who prosecutors say bears responsibility for the deadly 2024 shooting allegedly carried out by his son. Gray has pleaded not guilty to nearly 30 charges in the case.


            In addition to Melany, fellow students Nautica Walton, Taylor Jones and Natalie Griffith testified about the moments they were shot during the attack. They were all in their ninth-grade math class when they said Colt Gray opened fire through the class window.
    


            Nautica said she felt a hot spot on her leg and realized she had been shot, falling in and out of consciousness. First responders cut off her camo shorts to care for her that day, and a photo of the shorts was shown in court.
    


            Because of the shooting, she can't play sports anymore and is “very paranoid” and depressed, she said.
    


            Taylor said she looked at the classroom door and saw a “kid standing there with a gun” whom she had never seen before. She jumped to the floor and soon realized she had been shot in the leg.

            “After I got shot, I turned to my friend Landon and asked him to hold my hand because I was scared,” she said.
    


            She was airlifted to a hospital and has spent months there due to multiple surgeries. She said she can't play volleyball anymore and finds it hard to walk, and she missed an entire school year during her recovery.
    


            Natalie said she was shot in her shoulder and hand. As she was taken out of the classroom to an ambulance, she saw Colt Gray in handcuffs and angrily cursed at him, she said.
    


            “I saw red. I was very mad,” she said. “I remember yelling at him that we were kids.”
    


            The defense declined to cross-examine any of the students.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","AI overlords of the world hacked: Fallout from the massive Palantir breach","https://www.rt.com/news/632680-ai-overlords-of-world-hacked/","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 16:46:00 GMT","

By Igor Bederov, cybersecurity expert 

Palantir Technologies has been hacked, according to well-known blogger Kim Dotcom. The company develops software for intelligence and big data analysis. 

Palantir (named after the magical ‘seeing stones' from ‘The Lord of the Rings') doesn't engage in surveillance in the conventional sense using spies, cameras, or bugs. Instead, it develops software that is sold to government agencies, military organizations, and large corporations.

Clients (like the CIA or the German police) upload all their data, and Palantir (its primary platforms are Gotham for military purposes and Foundry for business) then utilizes AI to transform this chaotic information into a coherent picture.

Essentially, it creates a ‘digital twin' of reality, revealing connections that analysts could have never recognized on their own: for example, that a terrorist had called the cousin of someone who recently transferred money to a suspicious account.

The claims about wiretapping Trump and Musk are likely untrue or highly exaggerated. However, there's no doubt that Palantir serves as a massive surveillance mechanism for monitoring America's adversaries (and not only). It is an “operating system for war and intelligence,” providing agencies with a supercomputer that can see everything. But it's the agencies themselves that feed this computer with data.

Even if the hack is a hoax or only partially true, such a sensational story benefits various parties. It tarnishes the reputations of both Palantir and the CIA. The company was already at odds with human rights activists globally. In Europe, particularly in Germany and Switzerland, there's growing hesitation to purchase the software out of fear that sensitive data would end up with a US intelligence agency.

Russia and China – which, according to Dotcom, will receive the data – may capitalize on the story. Finally, Kim Dotcom is a longstanding enemy of the American justice system (he faces piracy charges in the US), so any story that casts a shadow on the US establishment is profitable for him.

The most valuable data concerns Palantir's developments for Ukraine. Should any documentation concerning the development of nuclear or biological weapons fall into Moscow's hands, it could provide invaluable insights into Kiev's ability to create a ‘dirty nuclear bomb' or biological agents.

This would eliminate uncertainties and allow for the formulation of preemptive protective measures. Furthermore, disclosing the source codes or AI architecture employed by Israel in Gaza and adapted for use by the Ukrainian army would enable the development of more effective electronic warfare systems capable of deceiving those very algorithms.

Hillary Clinton is attempting to use Ukraine as a distraction to avoid jail time for her role in fabricating the Russiagate hoax, Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev has said. The remarks come as Clinton has escalated attacks on US President Donald Trump's approach to the Ukraine conflict.

Clinton delivered a belligerent speech at the Munich Security Conference last week, accusing Trump of pursuing a “disgraceful” policy toward Ukraine, and claiming he has “betrayed the West” and abandoned “human values.” The former secretary of state also touted a plan to provide Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles and expand strikes inside Russian territory.

In a post on X, Dmitriev responded by claiming Clinton “tries to use Ukraine as a distraction not to go to jail for her Russiagate hoax,” referring to attempts by Clinton and former US President Barack Obama to frame Trump's 2016 campaign as colluding with Moscow.

Hillary Clinton and her husband Bill are scheduled to appear for deposition before the US House Oversight Committee next week as part of the ongoing investigation into late financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein's crimes. However, House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan has noted that Clinton will also face questions beyond Epstein, including about her campaign's role in propagating the discredited Russiagate conspiracy.

The Russiagate scandal stemmed from the so-called Steele dossier, a collection of unverified allegations compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele and funded by Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. The dossier was used by the FBI to secure surveillance warrants against Trump associates, despite internal assessments that questioned its reliability.

Last year, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified over 100 documents revealing that Obama-era intelligence officials had “manufactured” intelligence to build the Trump-Russia narrative and suppressed findings that Moscow lacked both the intent and the means to interfere in the 2016 election. Gabbard described the effort as a “treasonous conspiracy” and a “years-long coup.”

The revelations prompted Attorney General Pam Bondi to launch a grand jury investigation into Obama and his intelligence team in August 2025. 

Moscow has consistently denied any interference in the 2016 election, with Russian officials calling the allegations partisan fiction.

UNITED STATES

Judge orders exhibit restored

A federal judge in Pennsylvania on Monday ordered the National Park Service to reinstall a slavery exhibit at a Philadelphia historic site, pending the outcome of litigation after the city sued the government over its removal. The exhibit was dismantled and removed last month in response to US President Donald Trump's claims of an “anti-American ideology” at historical and cultural institutions. “The government claims it alone has the power to erase, alter, remove and hide historical accounts on taxpayer and local government-funded monuments within its control,” District Judge Cynthia Rufe wrote in her opinion. “Its claims in this regard echo Big Brother's domain in Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four,” Rufe added.

 NEW ZEALAND

Man killed in severe storm

Heavy rains and strong winds in the past few days have killed one man, flooded large areas and cut off several communities, authorities said. The severe storm since Friday has prompted a state of emergency in North Island, where the Waikato Regional Council said “one in 100 year” rainfall had caused widespread flooding. Police said a man died on Friday after the car he was driving was trapped in flood waters near North Island's Otorohanga. The storm reached the capital Wellington on Monday before yesterday moving toward Christchurch in the South Island.

 RUSSIA

US citizen sentenced

A court has sentenced a US citizen to four years in jail for trying to take the stocks of Kalashnikov assault rifles out of a Moscow airport, the RIA state news agency reported yesterday. The US citizen, who collects Kalashnikov weapons, bought two Kalashnikov stocks and checked in a suitcase containing the butts at Moscow's Vnukovo airport, but made no customs declaration, RIA said. The man, who was not identified by the news agency, was found guilty under an article in the criminal code dealing with the smuggling of weapons, it added.

AUSTRALIA

Lizard smuggler sentenced

A Sydney man who tried to mail native lizards, bearded dragons and other reptiles out of Australia in bags of popcorn and cookie tins has been sentenced to eight years in jail, authorities said yesterday. The eight-year term handed down on Friday was a record for wildlife smuggling, federal environment officials said. A district court in Sydney gave 61-year-old Neil Simpson a non-parole period of five years and four months. Investigators recovered 101 reptiles from seized parcels destined for Hong Kong, South Korea, Sri Lanka and Romania, the officials said in a statement. “Lizards, skinks and dragons were secured in calico bags. These bags were concealed in bags of popcorn, biscuit tins and a women's handbag and placed inside cardboard boxes,” it said.

ITALY

‘Lovers' Arch' collapses

A famous rock structure on Italy's Adriatic coast known as the “Lovers' Arch” collapsed on Valentine's Day after days of bad weather, prompting local officials to warn that other stretches of the fragile coastline could be at risk. The natural arch near Melendugno in the southern region of Puglia, had long been a popular backdrop for wedding proposals and tourist photos. “This is an unwanted Valentine's Day gift,” Melendugno Mayor Maurizio Cisternino told the local Corriere Salentino, calling the collapse “a very hard blow” for the area's image and for tourism.

As South Korea's global cultural influence expands in areas such as music, film and television, one form of entertainment struggling to attract attention even at home is Korea's traditional style of wrestling, known as ssireum.

Ssireum — pronounced like “see room” — had its heyday in the 1980s and early 1990s, when there were as many as eight professional teams and the top wrestlers became household names. 

Since then, it has been squeezed by tighter budgets and a public quick to move on to new trends.

Twenty-year-old Lee Eun-soo, who began training at the age of nine, is taking part in this year's Lunar New Year tournament, the showcase event for the more than 1,500-year-old sport.

Lee lamented that at his former high school, the ssireum team currently has no members and there is talk of disbanding it.

“I once tried to imagine my life if I hadn't done ssireum,” Lee said. “I don't think I could live without it.”

A ssireum match involves two wrestlers facing off in an 8m sandpit ring, gripping each other by a cloth belt called a satba and using strength, balance, timing and stamina to force the opponent to the ground.

Ssireum was inscribed on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2018, but that international recognition has not translated into commercial success. 

Its relative obscurity contrasts with the high profile of Japan's sumo, another centuries-old form of wrestling. Unlike sumo, which is supported by a centralized professional ranking system and six major annual tournaments — or Olympic wrestling, with its global reach — ssireum remains largely domestic.

“Sport is something people won't come to watch if they don't know the wrestlers or even the sport itself,” said Lee Tae-hyun, a former ssireum wrestler and professor of martial arts at Yong In University, who has promoted the sport overseas and believes it has commercial potential with the right backing.

Lee Hye-soo, 25, a spectator at the Lunar New Year tournament, said many Koreans are now unfamiliar with ssireum.

“My grandfather liked watching ssireum, so I watched it with him a lot when I was young,” she said.

“I like it now too, but I think it would be even better if it became more famous,” she said.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese yesterday said that his government would not help Australians in a Syrian camp holding families of suspected Islamic State (IS) militants return home, with the government open to prosecutions if they make it back.

“We have a very firm view that we won't be providing assistance or repatriation,” Albanese told ABC News. 

Thirty-four Australians released on Monday from a camp in northern Syria were returned to the detention center due to “technical reasons,” two sources told Reuters on Monday.

Dubbed “IS brides” by local media — though the group also includes children — they are expected to travel to Damascus before eventually returning to Australia, despite objection from ruling and opposition lawmakers.

A spokesperson for Australian Minister for Home Affairs Tony Burke said Australia's security agencies had been monitoring the situation in Syria, and said those who had broken the law would be prosecuted.

“People in this cohort need to know that if they have committed a crime and if they return to Australia they will be met with the full force of the law,” he said.

Islamic State is a listed terror organization in Australia, with membership of the group punishable by up to 25 years in prison. Australia also has the power to strip dual nationals of citizenship if they are an Islamic State member.

The return of relatives of suspected Islamic State militants is a political issue in Australia, which has seen a surge in popularity of the right-wing, anti-immigration One Nation party led by Pauline Hanson.

“They hate Westerners, and that's what it's all about. You say there's great Muslims out there, well I'm sorry, how can you tell me there are good Muslims?” Hanson said in an interview on Sky News on Monday, following news of the suspected Islamic State family members' return.

The comments were criticized by members of Hanson's party.

A poll this week found One Nation's share of the popular vote at a record high of 26 percent, above the combined support for the traditional center-right coalition currently in opposition.

Sarah Henderson, a senator in the Liberal party that has seen its vote eroded by One Nation, said that Australians with sympathies towards Islamic State should be barred from re-entering the country.

“If these are people who subscribed to ISIS ideology, who subscribe to this extremist ideology, then they should not be returning to Australia,” she told ABC.

Australian citizens have a legal right to enter the country under both local and international law.

DONETSK OBLAST — Walking through the mine-infested field under intense Russian drone surveillance was the scariest part of the mission for 22-year-old infantryman Mykola.

""If you stop, you die,"" said Mykola, a small-framed soldier with dark circles under his eyes and a tired stare. 

""When we were walking to get to the positions, it wasn't hard to walk — it was hard to realize that you may not walk out alive because there were a lot of our dead around.""

The walk to his positions near the eastern town of Myrnohrad was 22 kilometers (about 14 miles). Weather conditions and the intensity of Russian drones dictate the pace. It can take anywhere from a day to two weeks, depending on how often he and his comrades need to take cover from Russian drones. Soldiers and commanders interviewed for this story are not identified by their full names due to security concerns. 

Located merely five kilometers (about three miles) northeast of Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub in Donetsk Oblast, Myrnohrad — once a quiet town — has faced an onslaught of Russian offensives since the fall of 2025.

The Pokrovsk front currently faces the fiercest fighting, with Russia ramping up its offensive in late 2025 to finally capture the city, a highway and railway junction that used to connect the upper parts of Donetsk Oblast with key cities farther west, such as Dnipro. 

Pressuring Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad from the north, east, and the south, Russian troops have gradually closed in on the Ukrainian pocket over the past year, in a slow and costly operation to force Ukraine's withdrawal by cutting off supply routes. 

Russia appears to have either pushed out or eliminated the last small groups of Ukrainian infantrymen clinging to Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, according to Emil Kastehelmi, an analyst at the Finland-based Black Bird Group, which closely analyzes the war using open-source footage. The situation on their outskirts is likely still ""relatively messy,"" but the fight appears to be mostly over, with Russian troops actively trying to consolidate their latest gains, he added. 

""Even though Russians gained these urban areas, the slow fight will most likely continue, without very rapid changes from either side,"" Kastehelmi told the Kyiv Independent on Feb. 17. 

Independent Ukrainian open-source battlefield monitoring group DeepState has designated Myrnohrad as occupied by Russian forces on its map on Feb. 17. The Ukrainian military has yet to announce the fate of the town.

""It was hard to realize that you may not walk out alive because there were a lot of our dead (guys on the way).""

The reality on the ground is bleak, especially the long walk to the positions, where it is easy to get lost since the commanders have to plan new routes almost every time, soldiers say. 

Mykola is originally from Kherson, a city temporarily occupied by Russia in 2022. He said he tried to enlist as a teenager but was turned away for being too young until last year. 

The 22-year-old, a member of the 38th Marine Brigade, said the learning curve has been steep. Panic can prove fatal in combat. One wrong move could give away the location to Russian drones relentlessly hunting Ukrainian soldiers from above, he said. 

""If one person panics, it could kill the entire group,"" Mykola said, speaking to the Kyiv Independent near his safe house not far from the front line.

To this day, Mykola doesn't know the fate of six of his friends who lost radio contact in a field while walking back to the rear from their position on New Year's Day. They are considered missing in action (MIA) since their bodies have not been found.

Mykola says his walk to the position during his last mission — which lasted two months until December 2025 — was a nightmare. One of his older comrades was killed, and another was wounded after they could not move quickly enough to evade drones. He took the wounded man to an evacuation point and passed on the coordinates for his fallen comrade. 

""You can only help the wounded at the end,"" Mykola said, stressing how crucial it is to first prioritize your own survival.

With Russian drones controlling all routes into Myrnohrad, planning routes for troops to enter and exit positions is the most challenging task, according to a deputy battalion commander with the 38th Marine Brigade, who goes by his callsign ""Webster."" He said he tries to pick foggy days when drones are not able to work effectively, or brief moments when Russia focuses on another part of the front. 

The soldiers are usually given a few possible routes in and out since Russia tends to mine the paths as soon as it sees them being used or destroy them with weapons like artillery and aerial guided bombs (KABs), said Valentyn, a platoon commander from the 25th Air Assault Brigade fighting in Pokrovsk.


""You have to control your emotions, because you could get killed (if you lose control)."" 
    

Both sides' expansion of the ""kill zone"" to about 30 kilometers (about 19 miles) has made it practically impossible to drive up anywhere near the positions, forcing infantrymen to walk each time. With Russian troops advancing, more drones are reaching the rear of Ukraine's last positions in Myrnohrad and Pokrovsk. 

Reaching the positions is only the beginning. Infantrymen have to hold their positions against Russian assaults, one after another. Urban fighting offers both sides shelter in abandoned buildings and houses, where their troops can hide from drones rather than having to try digging dugouts or trenches in winter-hardened ground. 

""There are drones, there are bastards,"" Mykola said, referring to Russians. ""You need to move fast so neither finds you.""

Aerial guided bombs (KAB) are the scariest because they can easily zero in on even a multi-story building, leaving soldiers trapped under the rubble, according to soldiers and commanders who spoke to the Kyiv Independent. 

The first thing Mykola had to do after reaching Myrnohrad's outskirts in the fall of 2025 was turn a two-story house into a position. Every move had to be calculated to avoid omnipresent Russian drones from noticing, Mykola recalled. He knew not to touch the house's exterior to keep his position as discreet as possible, but he placed furniture, such as shelves, in front of windows to protect against shrapnel from potential attacks. 

Russian troops often assault in the dark or on foggy days, avoiding daylight when it is incredibly risky to move forward without being spotted, according to the soldiers. 

Fog makes it especially difficult to spot Russian troops occupying a nearby position, according to Mykola. He said a few Russian soldiers were once waiting in an adjacent house just 10 meters away during his last mission, until he noticed an elderly local woman speaking to them, giving away their position. 

""If there is a fog, (Russian troops) sit quietly and wait for others to arrive,"" Mykola recalled.

Life at the position depended on the number of Russian drones overhead. Mykola said some days he could barely even stick his head out the door, while on other days he could patrol the area and collect essentials, such as food and power banks. 

Knowing which buildings in the Myrnohrad area were still intact or destroyed helped him find cover while patrolling his sector, Mykola said. Even running to thin tree branches, which barely provide cover, is better than doing nothing at all, he explained. 

Russian drones spotted Mykola and his comrade firing at Russian forces at the neighboring house, and they vacated the house immediately. A KAB strike destroyed the house soon after, leaving nothing but ruins, he recalled. 

""You have to control your emotions, because you could get killed if you don't.""

Ukrainian and Russian officials are meeting in Geneva for another round of talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. The talks come just days before the 4-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of its neighbor.

Below are the latest updates from Russia's war in Ukraine on Tuesday, February 17:  

Talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators in Geneva have ended for the day.

""After the joint session, we continued working in groups by areas. The discussions focused on practical issues and the mechanisms of possible solutions,"" Ukraine's lead negotiator Rustem Umerov said on social media.

""Both the political and military tracks have completed their work for today.""

A source close to the Russian delegation told the AFP news agency that the negotiations ""were very tense.""

""They lasted six hours,"" the source said. ""They have now concluded. It has been agreed to continue tomorrow.""

Kyiv and Moscow remain far apart on key issues as their envoys meet in Geneva for a third round of US-led peace talks. DW correspondents Nick Connolly and Juri Rescheto gauge the mood within Ukraine and Russia.

Six Russian and four Belarusian athletes will participate in the Winter Paralympics in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) told the AFP and SID news agencies.

According to SID, Russia received quota places in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, and snowboarding, all of which are organized by the International Ski Federation (FIS).

The IPC General Assembly's decision to lift the suspension against Russia and Belarus at the end of September last year came as a surprise.

The partial suspension, which allowed athletes only to compete as neutrals, was put in place in 2023 in place of a complete ban that had been enacted afterRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. 

Russians and Belarusians are currently only participating in the Winter Olympics in Italy as neutral athletes.

A Russian military police building collapsed on the grounds of an army base outside Saint Petersburg, local governor Alexander Drozdenko said.

""I have instructed the security forces to assist the military in clearing the rubble and rescuing victims following the collapse of a military police building,"" Drozdenko said.

The local outlet 47news reported that three people died in the incident, citing emergency services. The outlet also reported that the collapse was caused by an explosion.

Other local media reported that three or four people may still be trapped under the rubble.

Drozdenko said the cause of the incident is being investigated.

French President Emmanuel Macron urged India to back a call for Russia to stop strikes on civilians and infrastructure after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Mumbai.

""As the ceasefire remains difficult to achieve, and I regret that, we could join our efforts to secure the establishment of an immediate and lasting moratorium on strikes against civilians and civilian infrastructure,"" Macron said, speaking alongside Modi.

Modi said India would continue to advocate for a peaceful resolution to the ongoing conflicts in western Asia and eastern Europe.

New Delhi and Moscow have longstanding ties. India has been buying discounted Russian oil that Moscow cannot easily sell elsewhere due to Western sanctions.

However, this may now be in question. Washington recently rolled back a 25% tariff after India committed to stop buying Russian oil.

Trilateral talks between Russian, Ukrainian and US delegations on a possible settlement in Ukraine have started in Geneva, according to Rustem Umerov, head of the Ukrainian delegation, and the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.

""Security and humanitarian issues are on the agenda,"" Umerov wrote on X.

""We are working constructively, focused and without excessive expectations. Our task is to maximally advance those solutions that can bring sustainable peace closer,"" he added.

Russia has increased its hybrid threat activities and appears willing to take greater risks near Sweden, according to Swedish military intelligence.

""Russia has, in certain cases, stepped up actions and increased its presence — and perhaps with a greater risk appetite — in our vicinity,"" Thomas Nilsson, head of Sweden's Military Intelligence and Security Service (MUST), told the AFP news agency.

He added that he believes Moscow will ""unfortunately"" continue to do so, regardless of whether it succeeds in areas such as Ukraine.

On Tuesday, MUST presented its yearly threat review, warning that Sweden's security situation has continued to deteriorate as it has in previous years, particularly since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The review stated that Russia is the main ""military threat to Sweden and NATO"" and warned that the threat is likely to grow as Moscow increases resources for its armed forces.

""Alongside resources for the war in Ukraine, Russia is reinforcing its resources in the Baltic Sea region, as it is a strategically very important region for Russia, both economically and militarily,"" MUST warned.

Ukrainian forces recaptured 201 square kilometers (78 square miles) from Russia between Wednesday and Sunday last week, taking advantage of a Starlink shutdown for Russian troops, according to data from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).

The recaptured land is concentrated around an area 80 kilometers east of Zaporizhzhia, where Russian troops have made significant progress since the summer of 2025.

""These Ukrainian counterattacks are likely leveraging the recent block on Russian forces' access to Starlink, which Russian milbloggers (military bloggers) have claimed is causing communications and command and control issues on the battlefield,"" the ISW said.

On February 5, military observers noted the disruption of Starlink antennas used by Moscow on the front lines after Elon Musk announced ""measures"" to end the Kremlin's use of this technology.

The recaptured area is nearly equal to the amount of land gained by Russian forces in December and is the largest amount of land retaken by Kyiv's forces since the June 2023 counteroffensive.

The Kremlin urged against expecting a breakthrough — or even any news at all — on Tuesday from the Ukraine peace talks in Geneva among Russia, Ukraine, and the United States.

""I don't think we should expect any news today,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, adding that the talks would continue on Wednesday.

Russia said the talks would take place behind closed doors. 

Nigeria has warned its citizens against being recruited to fight in armed conflicts abroad.

The warning follows reports that some Nigerians, like citizens of other African countries, were deceived into fighting for Russia in Ukraine.

In a statement dated Sunday, the Nigerian Foreign Ministry expressed ""grave concern over the rising and alarming cases of Nigerian citizens being illegally recruited to participate in foreign armed conflicts,"" though it did not name Russia.

""Several Nigerians who have fallen victim to such unfortunate situations were deployed to combat zones after being misled and coerced into signing military service contracts,"" the statement added.

Last week, the investigative collective All Eyes on Wagner published a report stating that at least 36 Nigerians had been recruited by the Russian army to fight in Ukraine, five of whom were killed in combat.

In November, Ukraine announced that it had identified at least 1,436 citizens from 36 African countries who were fighting for Russia.

Efforts to find a diplomatic solution to end Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine would be more effective when Kyiv shows ""justice and strength,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

In a post on X, which included photos of firefighters extinguishing blazes at energy facilities, he wrote, ""Our diplomacy will be more effective if there is justice and strength.""

""For peace to be real and just, action must target the sole source of this aggression — because it is Moscow that continues the killings, massive attacks, and assaults,"" he wrote, adding that rescue and repair efforts were underway in many regions.

Russia's Defense Ministry said it had carried out ‌a ""massive ⁠strike"" ⁠on Ukraine's military-industrial and energy ​facilities, Interfax news agency reported Tuesday.

Ukraine's ‌air ​force said earlier that Russia had launched 396 ​drones and 29 missiles overnight, ⁠adding ​that ​it shot down 25 ​of the ‌missiles and 367 of ​the ⁠drones. It said four ⁠ballistic missiles ​and 18 drones struck 13 different targets across Ukraine.

Meanwhile, in Russia, a fire broke out at the Ilsky refinery in the Krasnodar ‌region ⁠after ⁠a drone attack, local authorities said. They added that a reservoir with oil products ​was damaged.

On Tuesday, an oil product reservoir caught ​fire in Volna village, the site of the Russian Black ⁠Sea ​port of Taman, the ​regional governor said on Telegram. Later on Tuesday, officials said the fire had been extinguished. 

Ukraine has repeatedly targeted the Ilsky refinery with drone attacks. The facility's capacity is around 138,000 barrels per day. It was not ⁠clear ​if its operations had been interrupted by the recent attack.

The Russian Defense Ministry told state-owned media that its forces destroyed over 150 Ukrainian drones over Russian regions overnight.

Ukrainian and Russian officials are meeting for two days of negotiations in Geneva under US mediation.

As in the seemingly countless rounds of discussions between the two countries, a breakthrough isn't expected.

Ahead of the negotiations in Geneva, US President Donald Trump implied Ukraine needed to make more concessions to end the war. 

""Well, we have big talks. It's going to be very easy. I mean, look, so far, Ukraine better come to the table fast. That's all I'm telling you,"" Trump told reporters on Air Force One.

Russia has said Ukraine cede the remaining 20% of the eastern region ​of Donetsk that Russian forces have not captured. Kyiv has refused to give up any territory it controls.

Before his reelection in 2024, Trump had repeatedly promised to end the war in Ukraine on his first day back in office.

He has since backed away from that promise, calling the war more difficult to end than he expected.

In the past, Trump has heavily criticized both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and, to a somewhat lesser degree, his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.

Hundreds of apartment blocks in Kyiv have been transformed into towers of freezing concrete this winter. Massive Russian missile attacks on energy facilities in Ukraine have left thousands of people without heat and electricity.

Not only energy company employees but also private contractors, electricians and plumbers do their best to bring the frozen buildings back to life. Their work in these icy basements often goes unnoticed, but they are very much in demand.

New legislation in several states moves the scope of bathroom bans beyond schools and government buildings.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

In the modern anti-transgender panic, several states have passed laws banning transgender people from restrooms consistent with their gender identity. Early bills focused primarily on K-12 schools, but the scope quickly expanded. Some states extended bans to even private colleges and universities. Others adopted sweeping “government building” prohibitions, barring transgender people from restrooms in all publicly owned facilities — a far broader category than it sounds, encompassing airports, rest stops, and other everyday spaces. A few states went further still, adding punitive enforcement mechanisms; Florida, for example, attached criminal penalties to its ban. Yet one category remained largely untouched: private business bathrooms. That exception is now collapsing. Multiple states are advancing a new generation of bathroom bills that would extend these bans into private businesses for the first time.

The first clear sign that private business bathrooms could be targeted came this year in Kansas. At the end of January, the state passed SB 244 and HB2426 through a rushed “gut-and-go” process designed to bypass portions of public hearings. The legislation drew attention for several reasons, including provisions revoking the driver's licenses of transgender people and forcing them to obtain new ones reflecting their assigned sex at birth. But another provision — first identified by Erin In The Morning and later confirmed by legal and advocacy organizations in Kansas and nationally — was even more alarming. The bill appeared to create a mechanism allowing so-called bathroom bounty hunters to sue transgender people encountered in any restroom, whether in a government-owned building or a private business. With little warning, Kansas had advanced what looked to be the first measure directly threatening transgender people's access to private business bathrooms.

Although the bill was vetoed, Republicans hold enough seats in the Kansas Legislature to potentially override that veto. If they do, the measure would take effect quickly. Transgender Kansans would not only be forced to scramble for updated identification documents reflecting their assigned sex at birth, but would also have to navigate daily life by mapping trips around the availability of gender-neutral bathrooms. Any transgender person who simply continues using the restroom they have always used could face lawsuits seeking substantial damages from individuals eager to weaponize the law for harassment — or profit.

Now, it appears these kinds of bills are spreading. In Idaho, a separate measure — House Bill 607 — has just passed the House and is headed for the state's Senate for consideration. The bill similarly targets transgender people's access to private business bathrooms. The bill would allow lawsuits against any “place of public accommodation” that permits transgender people to use restrooms consistent with their gender identity. While it does not include the criminal penalties or explicit bounty-style provisions seen elsewhere, its practical effect would be sweeping: private businesses across the state could face legal risk simply for allowing transgender people to use the restroom. The scope of bathroom bans is no longer confined to schools or government buildings. It is expanding.

Erin In The Morning has identified additional bills in state legislatures across the country. In Indiana, HB 1198 would apply to any public restroom — whether privately owned or government-run — and would establish criminal penalties for anyone who “knowingly or intentionally enters a restroom that is designated to be used” by someone of a different assigned sex at birth. In Missouri, HB 2314 would weaponize the state's Human Rights Act against private businesses that allow transgender people to use restrooms consistent with their gender identity, effectively turning a civil rights law into a tool for restricting transgender rights. And in Idaho, yet another proposal would not only bar private businesses from permitting transgender people to use certain restrooms but would also impose criminal penalties on violators.

It is worth noting that, so far, anti-transgender bathroom bans have had uneven real-world enforcement. In K-12 schools — where administrators wield significant authority — they have been highly effective at policing transgender students. In colleges and public buildings, however, enforcement has been far more sporadic, with only a handful of documented expulsions from restrooms in states like Texas and Florida. But this next wave of legislation could fundamentally alter that balance. By targeting private businesses and imposing civil or criminal liability directly on transgender individuals, these bills move enforcement out of institutional hands and into the realm of lawsuits and vigilantism. And history offers a warning: once a new anti-trans legal strategy gains traction in one state, it rarely stays there.

In the last weeks, we have witnessed an authoritarian assault on communities in Minnesota and across the nation.

            •  The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a towering civil rights leader whose moral vision and fiery oratory reshaped the Democratic Party and America, has died at age 84. His son, Jesse Jackson Jr., told CNN that his father's greatest contribution was giving light to people “who found themselves in dark places.”



            • President Donald Trump praised him as “a force of nature like few others before him,” while former President Barack Obama described him as a “true giant.” 



            • In other tributes, civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton described Jackson as his mentor and “a movement unto himself,” while Bernice King posted a photo of Jackson alongside her father, Rev. Martin Luther King Jr, with the words, “Both now ancestors.”



Our live coverage of the tributes to Rev. Jesse Jackson has wrapped for the day. Please scroll below for details, or read our main story here. 



            Barack Obama has just released a statement on Jesse Jackson's death, writing that he is “deeply saddened to hear about the passing of a true giant.”
    


                    “For more than 60 years, Reverend Jackson helped lead some of the most significant movements for change in human history. From organizing boycotts and sit-ins, to registering millions of voters, to advocating for freedom and democracy around the world, he was relentless in his belief that we are all children of God, deserving of dignity and respect,” he said.
                





            Obamas said that he and his wife Michelle were directly inspired by Jackson, writing: “Michelle got her first glimpse of political organizing at the Jacksons' kitchen table when she was a teenager.”
    


            “And in his two historic runs for president, he laid the foundation for my own campaign to the highest office of the land,” Obama added.
    


                    “Michelle and I will always be grateful for Jesse's lifetime of service, and the friendship our families share. We stood on his shoulders. We send our deepest condolences to the Jackson family and everyone in Chicago and beyond who knew and loved him,' he said.
                





            Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, who grew up with Rev. Jesse Jackson, shared a heartfelt statement reminiscing on their childhoods, calling him “one of the most quintessential civil rights leaders.”
    


                    “Our relationship began as students at rival high schools in South Carolina and continued at rival HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) in the South – he at North Carolina A&T State University and me at South Carolina State University,” Clyburn said. “These rivalries forged a friendship that remain constant and mutually beneficial.”
                





            Jackson's “passion to bring together all creeds is a testament to his vision of unity, oneness, and a nation under one accord,” he wrote.
    


            If we all work together we can change history, the South Carolina lawmaker said, noting the initiatives Jackson worked on including Operation Breadbasket, an organization to improve the economic condition of Black communities across the nation, as well as anti-apartheid activism, voter registration, and corporate diversity.
    


                    “It should not be lost on any of us the impact that Reverend Jackson has had on the nation, Black Americans, and movements to encourage civic participation around the world. His vision is his legacy, and his teachings continue to inspire me as I continue the pursuit of justice and equality,” Clyburn said.
                





            Former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. described his father today as a “unique in American history.”
    


                    “He had spirit-energy, and even today, when the President of the United States referred to him as a force of energy and nature, make no mistake about it, Jesse Jackson was unique in American history. And I hope that his legacy lives on a new generation of Americans,” Jackson Jr. said in an emotional interview with Wolf Blitzer and Pamela Brown on CNN's “Situation Room.”
                





            The former Illinois lawmaker was referring to President Donald Trump's statement about the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who died today at age 84.
    


            Jackson Jr. said his father's greatest contribution in his activism was giving light to people “who found themselves in dark places” by spending tangible time with those in the margins of society.  Following the work of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, Jackson “did the best he could to keep that flame alive,” his son added.
    


            “He saw himself as a public servant. He believed in servant leadership. He saw himself as a seminarian. He saw politics as a way to carry out the ministry of feeding the hungry, of clothing the naked, of providing health care … of providing food,” Jackson Jr. said.
    


            Jackson was troubled by rising polarization, his son emphasized. One of Jackson's final communications with Trump was about “spirit, energy” and the “challenge before the President of the United States to bring all Americans together,” Jackson Jr. said, noting that he believed his father's relationship with Trump had the potential to strike a different tone.
    


            “Unfortunately, he was never the recipient of a return phone call from the President of the United States. But it's never too late. It's never too late to do right. My father sincerely believes that,” Jackson Jr. added.
    


            Omega Psi Phi Fraternity honored Jackson, a 1960 spring initiate of the Pi Psi Chapter, through a video tribute posted to Facebook and X. The posts highlighted Jackson's lifelong commitment to the organization.
    


            Jackson “stands as a towering figure in the global struggle for justice and human dignity,” the post said.
    


            The fraternity also praised his work for the marginalized, claiming his impact as “undeniable.”
    


            “With two groundbreaking presidential campaigns, more than forty honorary doctorates, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, his impact is undeniable. Yet his greatest legacy lives in the hope he has carried for the marginalized, the oppressed, and the unheard.”
    


            Bill and Hillary Clinton are the latest US politicians to pay tribute to Rev. Jesse Jackson, remembering him as someone who “championed human dignity and helped create opportunities for countless people to live better lives.”
    


            The former president and secretary of state said they were friends with Jackson for almost 50 years after meeting him in 1977 on the 20th anniversary of Little Rock Central High's integration of nine black students into the then-all-white school.
    


                    “Reverend Jackson never stopped working for a better America with brighter tomorrows,” the Clintons wrote in a statement, adding that “he championed the concerns of Black, Latino, Asian, and lower income white Americans.”
                





            Bill Clinton awarded Jackson the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in 2000.
    


            “Hillary and I loved him very much. Our hearts and prayers go out to Jackie, their children and grandchildren, and all the people across America and around the world who were inspired by his service to humanity.”
    


            Among the tributes pouring in for Rev. Jesse Jackson are messages from several world leaders, who remembered the civil rights leader as a global moral authority.
    


            South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said on social media that Jackson's campaigning against apartheid “was a towering contribution to the global anti-apartheid cause,” adding: “we are deeply indebted to the energy, principled clarity and personal risk with which he supported our struggle and campaigned for freedom and equality in other parts of the world.”
    


                    Ramaphosa added that his country is “sad to bid farewell to a global moral authority who gave voice to struggles within the United States as well as struggles for fundamental human rights and democracy around the world, including our own.”
                





            Kenya's President William Ruto called Jackson a “steadfast voice for justice and human dignity” in a post on X.



                    “Across decades of public life, he challenged the global community to expand opportunity and confront inequality, with courage and moral clarity,” Ruto said, adding that Jackson's “legacy will endure in the causes he advanced and the lives he changed.”
                





            French President Emmanuel Macron, meanwhile, called Jackson's death an “immense loss,” writing on social media that he was “a tireless promoter of civil rights” who “never stopped defending peace, justice and brotherhood.”
    


            Other notable international figures also paid tribute to Jackson, including British Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy, who called him a “pillar of the civil rights movement.”
    


            Nigerian civil rights activist Shehu Sani wrote that Jackson's death marked the “end of an era,” calling him “a trailblazer for civil rights and social justice.”
    


            Jackson's “unwavering dedication to racial equality, justice, freedom and compassion has made a lasting impact on the world,” he said.
    


CNN's Lauren Chadwick contributed to this reporting.



            In 1984, Jesse Jackson spoke at Democratic National Convention, arguing that the party should expand it's coalition to represent the “many patches” of American society.
    

In 1984, Jesse Jackson spoke at Democratic National Convention, arguing that the party should expand it's coalition to represent the ""many patches"" of American society. Jackson died at 84 after a long fight with a neurological disorder.


            In the hours since the announcement of Rev. Jesse Jackson's passing, heartfelt messages of condolences and friendship from prominent US political and civil right figures have been pouring in.
    


            Catch up on what they had to say about the towering civil rights leader here:
    

The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the pioneering civil rights leader and two-time presidential candidate, has died at 84, his family said, leaving behind a legacy that reshaped US politics and expanded the modern movement for racial justice.


            Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson staged campaigns against some of America's biggest companies and Wall Street to increase racial diversity and economic opportunities.
    


            Jackson frequently organized boycotts and economic protests to pressure major companies to hire Black and minority employees and executives, work with Black vendors, and support youth and jobs training programs for minorities.
    


            In 1971, Jackson founded Operation PUSH, an advocacy organization to advance economic development and political action for Black people.
    


            Operation PUSH organized high-profile boycotts during the following decades, including campaigns against Anheuser Busch, Coca-Cola, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Nike. The group secured detailed agreements from many companies to increase Black economic participation.
    


                    “The world of private capital and wealth is very much off limits for us,” Jackson said in a 1997 interview. “At this stage, that is our challenge: to open up the doors and bring down the walls on Wall Street.”
                





            In 2014, Jackson's Rainbow PUSH Coalition targeted the tech industry's lack of diversity. Jackson attended Google and Facebook's shareholder meetings.
    


            Jackson's organization last year joined a boycott of Target after the company rolled back some of its diversity programs.
    


            Bishop William Barber II remembered Rev. Jesse Jackson as “a civil rights leader, a human rights leader (and) a moral leader,” as well as his friend of more than 40 years.
    


            Describing Jackson as a “mighty lion,” Barber told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that the late civil rights activist understood that politics is “about people.”
    


                    “He understood that nonviolence was not not doing something. It was in fact, choosing your weapons. It was choosing the way of love and justice and truth and choosing to confront the system. And he will be remembered as one who was determined,” Barber said.
                





            Barber was arrested alongside Jackson in 2021 during a Capitol Hill protest over voting rights. The pair also participated in other protests, Barber said.
    


            “A few years ago, we walked in Texas for three days. Jesse, though he had some ailments, came and was with us … He was always there,” he said.
    


                    “He'll be remembered for that determination. He'll be remembered for caring about people,” he said, adding, “He'll be remembered as a mighty lion who has helped raise up a whole lot of others.”
                





            Chicago resident Ziff Sistrunk went to the headquarters of Rainbow Push today to pay respects to Rev. Jesse Jackson, saying the civil rights leader helped people such as himself believe “you could be somebody.”
    


                    “Rev. Jackson was the person who told ex-felons, such as myself, 40 years ago that when you come home it's going to be difficult but just tell yourself you are somebody.“The wife, the student who goes through difficulties, Rev. Jackson told us that we were somebody. And guess what we did? We believed it. We actually believed it, people actually believed that you could be somebody,” he said.
                





            “That's what brought me out here this morning,” he added, when interviewed by CNN outside the headquarters of the civil rights organization founded by Jackson.
    


            “Take his words, those simple words, that I am somebody. And if the children in schools, people that are getting shot up, believe in recovery, resilience, just take his simple words, that I am somebody.”
    


            Former President Joe Biden reflected on his decadeslong friendship and collaboration with Rev. Jesse Jackson, regarding him as a “man of God and of the people,” while reminding the public that the drive for equality endures following Jackson's passing.
    


                    “Throughout our decades of friendship and partnership, I've known Reverend Jackson as history will remember him: a man of God and of the people. Determined and tenacious. Unafraid of the work to redeem the soul of our Nation,” Biden said in a statement on X.






            Biden recalled witnessing Jackson's efforts through “tumult and triumph,” with “relentless insistence on what is right and just.” He said Jackson's activism leaves a legacy of fearless influence spanning Americans to presidents.
    


            While Jackson's service was guided by his belief in “the promise of America: that we are all created equal in the image of God and deserve to be treated equally,” Biden noted that the challenge remains to attain that ideal.
    


            “While we've never fully lived up to that promise, he dedicated his life to ensuring we never fully walked away from it either,” Biden said.
    


            Civil rights and personal injury attorney Ben Crump released a statement mourning the life of his longtime friend and mentor.
    


            “Reverend Jackson never stopped pushing America to live up to its promise. He empowered millions to declare, ‘I am somebody,' and expanded the path for leaders of color in politics and public life,” Crump said in a post on X.
    


            He went on to praise Jackson as a figure who shaped him personally while recalling Jackson's march alongside Dr. King as just one of his numerous achievements in pushing for equality.
    


            “Reverend Jackson conceived of a more just and inclusive America, believed in it with unwavering faith, and dedicated his entire life to achieving it –– all while teaching the next generation how to carry the torch forward,” he said in the post.
    


            Crump noted that his legacy will continue through his dedicated service and advancements of the last-half century.
    


            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer hailed Jesse Jackson as a “fearless warrior,” describing him as one of the most prominent figures for change in the world.
    


                    “Jesse Jackson was an icon of the civil rights movement and a fearless warrior for justice for all people. He was one of the most powerful forces for positive change in our country and our world. America is a more equal and just place thanks to his work,” the Democratic leader said in a statement on X.
                





            Schumer offered prayers and recalled lessons of service honoring Jackson's lifelong work. He called upon the public to follow Jackson's footsteps.
    


            Martin Luther King III and his wife Arndrea Waters King called Rev. Jesse Jackson a “living bridge between generations.”
    


            “A towering voice and a devoted servant of justice. Reverend Jackson was more than a civil rights advocate — he was a living bridge between generations, carrying forward the unfinished work and sacred promise of the Civil Rights Movement,” the pair said in a statement.
    


                    Jackson “walked with courage when the road was uncertain, spoke with conviction when the truth was inconvenient, and stood with the poor, the marginalized, and the forgotten when it was not popular to do so,” they continued.
                





            The Kings added that Jackson had faith in the power of action and said that their hearts are with his loved ones, as well as the “countless people whose lives were touched by his ministry and movement.”
    


                    “We honor his extraordinary legacy and lifelong devotion to civil rights and human dignity. May his memory be a wellspring of strength and courage for all who continue the sacred work to which he gave his life,” they said.
                





            The Rev. Jesse Jackson was “a lifelong soldier for justice” and “a transformative leader whose life's work is deeply woven into the history, mission, and enduring impact of our Association and the nation,” the NAACP said in a statement honoring his life.
    


            “As a young organizer in the 1960s, he labored alongside NAACP leaders, spoke at several national conventions, marched with our members, and helped expand the national movement for racial equality into a broad, people-powered coalition demanding systemic change,” the association said.
    


            In a joint statement, the leaders of the NAACP continued: “His work advanced Black America at every turn. He challenged this nation to live up to its highest ideals, and he reminded our movement that hope is both a strategy and a responsibility. His historic run for president inspired millions and brought race to the forefront of American politics.”
    


                    “We honor his legacy by continuing the work he championed: protecting the right to vote, expanding economic opportunity, and fighting for the freedom and dignity of Black people everywhere,” said NAACP Chairman Leon W. Russell, Vice Chair Karen Boykin Towns, and President Derrick Johnson.
                





            The NAACP, founded in 1909, advocates and litigates for the civil rights of Black Americans and works to end race-based discrimination.
    


            Former Vice President Kamala Harris wrote a tribute to Jesse Jackson in a social media post this morning, saying Jackson “let us know our voices mattered. He instilled in us that we were somebody.”
    


                    “Reverend Jackson gave a voice to people who were removed from power and politics,” Harris wrote, adding that Jackson “widened the path for generations to follow in his footsteps and lead.”
                





            The former vice president shared an anecdote about receiving many a “thumbs up or honk of support” while driving around with a “Jesse Jackson for President” bumper sticker during her time in law school.
    


                    “I was proud to partner with and learn from him on this work throughout my career, and I am so grateful for the time we spent together this January. Reverend Jackson was a selfless leader, mentor, and friend to me and so many others,” she wrote.
                





            “Today and every day, we will carry forward his call to “Keep hope alive,”” her post concluded.
    


            Andrew Young, a civil rights leader and former US ambassador to the United Nations, remembered his friend Rev. Jesse Jackson as “always trying to look out for other people.”
    


            Speaking with CNN, Young recounted meeting Jackson for the first time in Selma, Alabama, during a protest.
    


            “Jesse Jackson and I met in Selma. He was still a student,” Young said. People were backed up in a church because the police had pushed them there, according to Young who said, “to keep people from being hurt, I was standing there and I'd been there all day.”
    


                    “He came up to me that night and he said, ‘Look, I can hold this place for you. You really need to go get some sleep.,'” Young said. “I was very grateful. And from then on he was always a young man looking at how he could help somebody.”
                





            After the encounter that night, Young said he talked to Martin Luther King Jr. about Jackson.  “‘I met a young man last night, he's from Chicago. When we go there we need to look him up.'” Young said he told King. “But (Jackson) looked us up.”
    


            Jackson and Young became “good friends” according to the ambassador.
    


            President Donald Trump acknowledged the passing of civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, whom he called “a good man” and “a force of nature like few others before him.”
    


                    “I knew him well, long before becoming President. He was a good man, with lots of personality, grit, and ‘street smarts.' He was very gregarious - Someone who truly loved people!” Trump posted on Truth Social.
                





            Trump also used his history with Jackson and his Rainbow Coalition to defend his character after the president was recently criticized for posting (and then deleting) a racist video.
    


            “Despite the fact that I am falsely and consistently called a Racist by the Scoundrels and Lunatics on the Radical Left, Democrats ALL, it was always my pleasure to help Jesse along the way,” Trump said. He ended the lengthy social media post with condolences to the Jackson family.
    


            “He loved his family greatly, and to them I send my deepest sympathies and condolences. Jesse will be missed!” Trump said.
    


            Back in 1999, Jackson praised Trump, then a real estate developer, at the Rainbow PUSH Coalition Wall St. Project Conference, saying Trump gave them space for the Wall St. project.
    


            However, during Trump's campaign for president in 2016, when he was promoting the idea that then-President Barack Obama was not born in the United States, Jackson criticized Trump, telling Bloomberg Television, Trump “saw a lie as a victory.”

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Late-night host Stephen Colbert said his interview with Democratic Texas Senate candidate James Talarico was pulled from Monday night's broadcast over network fears it would violate regulatory guidance from the Trump administration on giving equal time to political candidates.

The issue came just hours before early voting opened Tuesday in Texas' primary elections, which feature hotly-contested Senate nomination races in both parties. 

“He was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,” Colbert said on his program, ”The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”

“Then I was told, in some uncertain terms, that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on. And because my network clearly doesn't want us to talk about this, let's talk about this.”

Talarico is in a spirited contest for the Democratic nomination as media institutions are navigating around changing broadcast guidance, issued under the Trump administration, governing how they interview political candidates. His main opponent is U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, and both have built national profiles through viral social media clips.

On the Republican side, four-term incumbent Sen. John Cornyn is facing the political fight of his career against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt. Paxton stepped up his campaign with a Monday night rally in Tyler in east Texas. 

Talarico posted a nearly minute-long clip of his interview with Colbert on X, calling it “the interview Donald Trump didn't want you to see.” He planned to have a Tuesday evening rally in Austin. 

“I think Donald Trump is worried we're about to flip Texas,” Talarico said in a statement. “This is the most dangerous kind of cancel culture, the kind that comes from the top.”

Broadcast networks have been required to give equal time to political candidates, but that rule hasn't traditionally been applied to talk shows. In January, the Federal Communications Commission issued new guidance warning late-night and daytime hosts that they need to give political candidates equal time, with FCC Chairman Brendan Carr questioning the talk show exemption and positing that hosts were “motivated by partisan purposes.” 




“The FCC has not been presented with any evidence that the interview portion of any late night or daytime television talk show program on air presently would qualify for the bona fide news exemption,” according to the public notice.

In his comments, Colbert noted that the equal time provision applies to broadcast but not streaming platforms. Subsequently, his nearly 15-minute interview with Talarico was posted to the YouTube page for Colbert's show, with the host noting specifically that the segment was only appearing online and not on broadcast.

Neither CBS nor the FCC immediately responded to messages seeking comment Tuesday.

Carr, appointed by Trump to lead the agency last year, has often criticized network talk shows, suggesting last year that probing ABC's “The View” — whose hosts have frequently been critical of Trump — over the exemption might be “worthwhile.”

Colbert's days in his host chair are limited, following CBS' announcement last year that it was canceling his show this May for financial reasons, shuttering a decades-old TV institution in a changing media landscape.

But the timing of that announcement — three days after Colbert criticized the settlement between Trump and Paramount Global, parent company of CBS, over a “60 Minutes” story — led two U.S. senators to publicly question the motives behind the move, which served to remove from air one of Trump's most prominent and persistent late-night critics.

Meanwhile, Talarico and Crockett are hoping to avoid a May 26 runoff by capturing at least 50% of the Democratic vote in the March 3 primary. Paxton, too, is trying to avoid a runoff, and until Friday, the only ad his relatively low-key campaign ran had attacked Hunt.

Hunt is trying to appeal to voters seeking an alternative to Cornyn but uneasy about Paxton. The Texas attorney general beat a 2023 impeachment trial on corruption charges and reached a deal to end a long-running securities fraud case but now faces a contentious divorce over allegations of adultery.

Hunt released a new ad Tuesday, with photos of him with Trump, hitting Cornyn over his long political year and declaring, “This is our moment to end the status quo.” 

But Paxton's campaign has been airing its own ad featuring video clips of him with Trump since Friday. The president had not endorsed any candidate as of Monday. Paxton on Monday night portrayed Cornyn as a creature of the Washington establishment, adding, “Well, I'm not their person and I'm never going to be their person.” 

Early voting began with Paxton looking like the GOP's front-runner, even though Cornyn's campaign and allied super PACs had spent more than $54 million on television advertising since last year, according to the ad-tracing service AdImpact. Paxton believes he's even better known than Cornyn.

Republican Senate leaders in Washington say Paxton as the GOP nominee would require hundreds of millions of dollars more to defend in a general election than Cornyn would — and that the party shouldn't have to spend in a state Trump carried by over 13 percentage points. 

Cornyn hit on those concerns in a Tuesday rally in Austin.

“We'll pay the price of having an albatross like our corrupt attorney general around their neck,” he said. “It will take a toll on everybody on the ballot.”

MILAN (AP) — Olympic hockey knows all about big hits.

That now includes “Heated Rivalry,” a gay hockey romance TV series in which two players from opposing teams carry out a secret, long-term relationship.

The steamy connection between the characters — Canadian Shane Hollander and Russian Ilya Rozanov — has attracted fans to both the show and the sport itself, with the NHL seeing a boost in ticket sales by one estimate.

The show's impact was evident long before the Milan Cortina Games when co-stars Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie carried the Olympic flame. And it hasn't stopped there. Athletes and fans from Canada and the U.S. are feeling the show's impact.

Zach Werenski, a defenseman on the U.S. team who plays for the NHL's Columbus Blue Jackets, said the show has come up in conversation in the locker room.

“Everyone is saying how great it is, I just haven't seen it yet,” Werenski told The Associated Press after a 5-1 victory over Latvia. “It's definitely good for the sport of hockey. Whenever you can add more eyes to the game and have people talk about the game and talk about inclusivity, I think it's just great for the sport.”

Jake Sanderson, another U.S. defenseman who plays for the Ottawa Senators, said he has heard about the show, but doesn't know much about it. When asked how far off the NHL is from having an openly gay player, Sanderson cited Luke Prokop. In 2021, Prokop was a Nashville Predators prospect who became the first player signed to an NHL contract to come out, though he has not yet played in the league.

“You never know if that show (will) instill some confidence in some people,” said Sanderson, adding that any openly gay player would be fully accepted in the locker room. “I don't think we would treat them any differently. They're our teammate, we love them no matter what, and obviously embrace them, absolutely.”




Rachel Reid's novel “Heated Rivalry” was published in 2019 as part of a series. The TV adaptation, originally developed for Canadian streaming service Crave, was the top-rated series on HBO Max in its first season. It has been renewed for a second season.

“It's obviously a show about hockey that's sparked a lot of interest in people even outside of our game,” Canada's Travis Sanheim said Tuesday. “Just heard a lot of people talking about. It's obviously good to have our game being talked about.”

Its biggest fans at the Olympics may be the Canadian delegation.

As part of the Olympic experience, athletes were gifted a potted plant. Many of the Canadians named theirs Shane or Ilya, according to the delegation's lead press liaison, Tara MacBournie.

Canadian Alpine skier Kiki Alexander took the love a bit further, sharing on TikTok that the village's Canadian moose has been named Shane.

“If you know, you know,” she wrote.

Adam van Koeverden, a 2004 Olympic champion in canoeing who is now Canada's secretary of state for sport, is a fan of the show.

“We're the perfect country to be having the conversation and be putting that art out there that I think is advancing the conversation on diversity in hockey,” van Koeverden told the AP at the Games. “Hockey is for everyone and ‘Heated Rivalry' makes it clear.”

The show launched in Europe in January and is proving a surprise hit in Russia, despite the country's anti-LGBTQ+ crackdowns. Because of the war in Ukraine, the IOC has allowed just a handful of Russian athletes to compete at the Milan Cortina Games as neutral individuals.

Athletes aren't the only ones riding the “Heated Rivalry” wave. Kim Sweet of Calgary, Alberta, is only on Episode 3 but is loving it.

“The show has me very intrigued,” Sweet, 50, said before entering the arena to watch Canada play Czechia last week. “How a very male-dominated sport has two guys having to work through the privacy of it all, and whether you ever want to come out.”

“It's great having more eyes on the sport,” added Sweet, who described herself as “a huge hockey fan.”

Angie Campos, a California resident, was also in attendance and wearing a sweatshirt featuring the jerseys of the show's main characters.

Campos is new to hockey, drawn to it by the series, and she isn't alone. Weekly NHL ticket sales saw a more than 20% rise after the show debuted in late November, according to data from ticketing platform SeatGeek. It saw no similar surge the same period a year earlier.

“The series didn't just light up social media feeds, it may have sent fans straight to hockey games themselves,” SeatGeek said in its analysis Jan. 16. “While it's impossible to attribute all of this growth to a single show, the timing is hard to ignore.”

Campos likened her newfound fandom and that of fellow “Heated Rivalry” viewers to the surge of female NFL fans after Taylor Swift started dating Kansas City Chiefs player Travis Kelce and attending games.

“It just makes it a little bit more relatable and it has definitely opened eyes to a human side of competition,” she said.

Hockey is a rough-and-tumble sport with occasional fighting and hard hits, even in crucial games where a penalty can prove costly. Canada's Tom Wilson and Pierre Crinon of France were ejected for fighting in Canada's win on Sunday.

All the machismo and aggression make the rink — and hockey in general — an unlikely and provocative setting to explore the delicate feelings of forbidden love and taboos around male sexual orientation. No active NHL player has come out as gay in the century-plus existence of the league.

“Heated Rivalry” has been wildly popular among women, but men are starting to find the appeal.

At the Canada-France game, Christopher Ryan York, 20, said he has hopped on the bandwagon, too. It was hard not to watch the show given how popular it has become, he said, and he's happy it's creating new hockey fans.

“Anything to grow the sport, for sure,” he added.

His father Kevin York, 60, said he hasn't seen the show, but can't stop hearing about it back home in Alberta and believes it must be truly inspirational if it spurred a Canadian hockey player to come out as gay: Jesse Kortuem of Vancouver, who stepped away from the game at 17 for fear he wouldn't be accepted, shared his coming-out statement on Instagram on Jan. 13.

“Something has sparked in me (ok — yes credit to #HeatedRivalry),” he wrote. “I thought I would share because I want to speak to the athletes out there who are still in the closet or struggling to find their way. I want you to know that there is hope and you're not alone.”

After NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said last weekend that tanking is the worst it's been ""in recent memory,"" Mark Cuban believes he and the league office should ""embrace"" it.

The NBA recently fined the Utah Jazz and Indiana Pacers, who own a combined record of 33-78, $500,000 and $100,000, respectively, for sitting healthy players, and Silver said last weekend he is considering ""every possible remedy"" to combat it.

But Cuban, who has admitted to tanking in the past, posted on X ""Why the NBA should embrace"" teams not putting their best foot forward for future gain.

""The NBA has…been misguided thinking that fans want to see their teams compete every night with a chance to win. It's never been that way,"" Cuban began in a lengthy X post.

""When I got into the NBA, they thought they were in the basketball business. They aren't. They are in the business of creating experiences for fans. Few can remember the score from the last game they saw or went to. They can't remember the dunks or shots. What they remember is who they were with. Their family, friends, a date. That's what makes the experience special. 

""Fans know their team can't win every game. They know only one team can win a ring. What fan (sic) that care about their team's record want is hope. Hope they will get better and have a chance to compete for the playoffs and then maybe a ring. The one way to get closer to that is via the draft. And trades. And cap room. You have a better chance of improving via all 3, when you tank.

""We didn't tank often. Only a few times over 23 years, but when we did, our fans appreciated it. And it got us to where we could improve, trade up to get Luka [Doncic] and improve our team.

""The NBA should worry more about fan experience than tanking. It should worry more about pricing fans out of games than tanking. You know who cares the least about tanking, a parent who cant afford to bring their 3 kids to a game and buy their kids a jersey of their fave player Tanking isn't the issue. Affordability and quality of game presentation are.""

With a stacked NBA Draft class, it appears that more teams are vying for better chances at the No. 1 pick. And while the lottery had good intentions to not guarantee the worst team the best pick, the luck of the draw has led to more and more teams who know they cannot compete for a championship to compete for what they hope will be their next chance at one.

""If teams are manipulating their performance in order to get higher draft picks even in a lottery, then the question becomes ... are they really the worst-performing teams?"" Silver said during NBA All-Star Weekend. ""It's not clear to me, for example, that the 30th-performing team is that much measurably worse than the 22nd-performing team, particularly if you have incentive to perform poorly to get a better draft pick…

Team USA men's speedskating took home a silver medal on Tuesday at the 2026 Milan Cortina Games, finishing just behind Italy in the team pursuit competition.

The team comprised of Ethan Cepuran, Casey Dawson and Emery Lehman finished with a time of 3:43.71 and was good enough for second place in the event. Italy's team, featuring Davide Ghiotto, Andrea Giovannini and Michele Malfatti, clinched the gold medal with a time of 3:39.20.

The U.S. started well against Italy this time around but the Italians charged ahead in the closing laps.

It's the second team pursuit medal for Cepuran, Dawson and Lehman. They were on the team with Joey Matia at the 2022 Beijing Olympics. The trio set a world record in team pursuit in November with a time of 3:32.49.

Cepuran, Dawson and Lehman had hoped that their team effort would have been able to be enough to capture the gold. They previously acknowledged that they weren't the strongest of skaters but knew they were a great team. Dawson withdrew from the Olympic 10,000 meters last week to focus on team pursuit.

Turning 34 in April, it's becoming more and more likely that Aaron Judge may join Don Mattingly as the only New York Yankees captains without a World Series ring in the modern era.

Judge is coming off his third MVP season in the last four years but remains without what really matters in Yankees universe: a title.

Well, after Judge's Yankees were bounced in the American League Division Series last season, they're running it back with an almost identical team.

At one point, the Yankees offseason looked bleak — or as Judge put it, ""brutal.""

""I'm seeing other teams around the league get better. They're making trades, they're signing big prospects or big players and we kind of were sitting there for a while, kind of making smaller moves,"" Judge said.

""Early on, it was pretty tough to watch. I'm like, 'Man, we're the New York Yankees, let's go out there and get the right people, get the right pieces to go out there and finish this thing off.'""

But after the Yankees re-signed Cody Bellinger, Trent Grisham and Paul Goldschmidt, Judge was content.

""I think once we solidified getting Bellinger back, we got Trent being our center fielder, being our leadoff guy for another year. You add a guy like Goldy, some of the back-end bullpen pieces that we've been doing, I think we'll be in a good spot…"" Judge said.

""We've got a special group of players here. We've got a good core, good young core. It was frustrating, but I think we're right where we need to be.""

The Yankees finished with 94 wins and tied for the best record in the American League but lost the tiebreaker to the Toronto Blue Jays, who overpowered them in the ALDS.

In this article

Amazon shares whipsawed on Tuesday, as the stock attempted to make a comeback from a historic slide.

Should the stock close in the red, it would mark a 10th consecutive negative session, tying the company's longest streak of daily losses on record, which it notched in 1997. 

The nine-day slide reached Friday is the worst streak since 2006.

Amazon shares have lost roughly 18% of their value since Feb. 2, axing about $450 billion in market valuation as investors question the merits of its artificial intelligence spending plans.

The selling frenzy around Amazon is tied to the company's fourth-quarter earnings report released earlier this month.

Amazon said it expects to spend $200 billion in capital expenditures this year, a nearly 60% increase from last year and more than $50 billion above Wall Street's forecast. Most of the spending is expected to go to AI-related initiatives, which require more infrastructure such as data centers, chips and networking equipment. 

Investors have grown increasingly concerned about tech companies' hefty AI investments and their potential to shrink or erase free cash flows. 

Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon's capital expenditures could hit $700 billion this year as the companies race to build out more infrastructure. 

Alphabet stock slid more than 1% on Tuesday, while Microsoft and Meta shares were down less than a percent. Shares of Microsoft and Alphabet are both headed for their fifth straight negative session. 

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy defended the massive outlay, telling analysts in a conference call that he's confident it will ""yield strong returns on invested capital."" 

Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman has also sought to justify the spending increase, telling CNBC in an interview last week that the capex boost will allow the company to seize AI opportunities in the cloud.

Wedbush analysts wrote in a research note following Amazon's fourth-quarter report that the company is now in ""prove it mode"" to show investors it can deliver a return on capex spending. 

""The increase in spending will remain an overhang as investors digest the guide and will likely need to see more tangible returns before regaining comfort,"" the analysts wrote. 

The firm has an outperform rating on Amazon shares.

This Q&A is part of America: 250 Years Bold, a CNBC multiplatform series highlighting the leaders, institutions, and ideas that have shaped the United States over the past 250 years.

Dr. Rajiv J. Shah, president of The Rockefeller Foundation, leads one of the nation's most influential philanthropic institutions. Founded in 1913, the organization has invested more than $26 billion worldwide to advance public health, expand access to opportunity and tackle global challenges at scale. In this conversation, Shah reflects on the foundation's legacy — from pioneering breakthroughs in science and medicine to shaping modern philanthropy — and discusses how its mission continues to evolve to address inequality, strengthen resilience and expand economic opportunity in the United States and around the world.

Dr. Rajiv J. Shah: John D. Rockefeller Sr. was a titan. He built America during the Industrial Revolution, and helped, together with others, create the modern country we have. He was one of the pioneers who shaped that economic transformation that gave us railways and automobiles and gasoline and the power to go about improving our quality of life. In doing so he, of course, went from being someone who came from modest resources to the world's wealthiest individual, and decided he would use that wealth to give back to society and help shape a future that was hopeful and optimistic, not just for the winners of that age, but for everybody.

Shah: The Rockefeller Foundation was created in 1913, although long before that, John D. Rockefeller, when he was 16 years old and got his first job, started tithing to his church. He was a devout Baptist who believed in charitable giving. When he created the foundation, he did it with a partner, Frederick Gates, who was his advisor and an early trustee, and they decided the foundation would be used specifically to invest in those areas where science and innovation could transform life on this planet.

Shah: The Rockefeller Foundation was established more than 100 years ago to take on major global projects that would transform life and the nature of opportunity for the world's most vulnerable people. We were founded to do scientific philanthropy because John D. Rockefeller believed that science applied to health, agriculture, energy and even social sciences applied to governance could really help transform society and make it an environment where everyone flourishes, not just the select few. The very first big project the foundation took on was eradicating hookworm in the American South. They built a reference lab, they created the county-based American public health system, and they successfully eradicated hookworm. Went on to tackle malaria, and that process created both huge successes in modern public health, but also seeded the American public health system county by county across this country, and presented the antecedents of the Centers for Disease Control based in Atlanta.

Shah: We focus today on bringing science, innovation and partnership to lift up vulnerable populations across the planet. We have four major areas of work and investment — health, food, energy and jobs — and we engage in large-scale public-private partnerships to deliver those outcomes. We invest all the time in core science around food, nutrition, energy, energy storage, battery technology, things that we think can make a difference, especially for those people who are vulnerable across this planet. One example of a risk we took is we issued a social impact bond, raised $500 million and put that entire amount of capital into one project to help make sure we could get more people out of energy poverty using renewable energy technologies. Today, we've mobilized more than $50 billion to reach more than 300 million people with energy access in Africa through an initiative we call ""Mission 300.""

Shah: America has always been a frontier nation, and when John D. Rockefeller created the Rockefeller Foundation, it was during a time of economic transformation. Our history teaches us we can innovate and partner and collaborate and solve the challenges we face. My parents came here in the late 1960s as immigrants from India. I was raised to understand almost every day at the dinner table that America is a country where, if you worked hard and played by the rules, you and your kids would get a chance to thrive. What has changed is that today fewer than half of America's kids are predicted to do better than their parents, and so we need to recreate a pathway to the American Dream for kids across this country that we are otherwise leaving behind. That's the mission of the Rockefeller Foundation going forward.

Oil prices fell Tuesday after Iran's foreign minister said progress was made during nuclear talks with the U.S., fueling hopes that negotiations could prevent another conflict in the Middle East. 

U.S. crude oil fell 61 cents, or 0.97%, to $62.28 per barrel by 10:26 a.m. ET. Global benchmark Brent was down $1.42, or 2.07%, to $67.23.

Iran and the U.S. reached a ""general agreement"" on Tuesday on guiding principles during talks in Geneva, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said, according to the semiofficial Tansim news agency.  Araghchi described talks with the U.S. as serious and constructive. 

Tensions remain high between Iran and the U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened strikes on the Islamic Republic if it does not cut a deal over its nuclear program.

Iran conducted war games Tuesday in the Strait of Hormuz, a trade choke point that is vital for international crude supplies. Traffic through the strait was suspended for several hours as Iran's Revolutionary Guard held naval exercises, according to the Tasnim news agency. 

About one-third of all waterborne crude oil exports pass through the strait, according to data from consulting firm Kpler. 

The Guard is prepared to close the Strait of Hormuz if ordered to do so, Rear Adm. Alireza Tangsiri said, according to the Tansim news agency.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Used car inventory is improving, but 'affordable under-$20,000 vehicles are harder to find,' expert says","https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/17/used-car-affordability.html","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 14:15:01 GMT","



Even as experts anticipate more supply in the used car market this year, consumers probably won't see much relief on pricing.

While dealer inventories continue to slowly improve, the higher-cost mix of vehicles hitting the used car market — and wholesale prices that ticked higher in January — could limit how much that added supply translates into cheaper cars.

Although the consumer price index shows that prices for used cars were down 1.8% in January from December and 2% from a year earlier, they're easing off record highs. The average price of a used car up to 8 years old was $30,202 in 2025, up 27.6% from $23,668 in 2020, according to J.D. Power.

""The affordable under-$20,000 vehicles are harder to find,"" said Jonathan Banks, a vice president with J.D. Power.

That's likely to remain the case even as inventory improves. ""You'll see a richer mix of vehicles,"" Banks said. ""That's just the reality of it.""

The share of under-$20,000 cars was 30% in 2025, down from 53% in 2019, according to J.D. Power.

Because consumers have been hanging on to their cars for longer, today's higher prices may be a bit of a shock for them, Banks said.

""A lot of people will be coming into the market when they haven't been there in a long time,"" he said.

Although used car prices have eased, they remain elevated against a backdrop of a broader household affordability crunch. Many consumers are already struggling to keep up with high costs for everyday things like housing, groceries and insurance premiums.

Compared with the average price paid for a new car — $49,191, according to Kelley Blue Book — the used car market may be the more desirable option.

However, the cost of financing a used car is also a pain point. Interest rates generally are higher compared with those that apply to new car loans, which can be especially costly for consumers with poor credit. 

For credit scores ranging from 501 to 600, the average interest rate for used car loans was 19% in the third quarter of 2025, according to Experian. That's compared with an average of 7.43% for consumers with a score of 781 to 850.

The average amount financed for a used vehicle in January was $29,364 and the average interest rate was 10.5%, according to Edmunds. 

If that amount were financed at that interest rate over 72 months — the average is 69.7 months — the monthly payment would be $551, and the interest paid over the full life of the loan would be $10,339, according to Bankrate's auto loan calculator. That would push the total amount paid for the car to $39,703.

Separately, a small but growing share of consumers are taking out used car loans with a monthly payment of $1,000 or more, according to Edmunds. In the final quarter of 2025, 6.3% of buyers committed to a payment of that amount, compared with 6.1% in the third quarter and 5.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The variety of available used vehicles reflects what's been purchased in the new car market over time. Consumers have preferred SUVs and trucks over sedans for years. Last year, sedans accounted for just 17% of the new car market, according to Edmunds. In 2015, that share was above 40%.

A greater number of vehicles are coming off of three-year leases this year compared with last year due to higher lease volume in 2023 than in 2022, said Ivan Drury, director of insights for Edmunds. Additionally, a growing number of fleet vehicles — for example, rental cars — should hit the used car market this year as that supply also continues recovering from pandemic-era disruptions.

As carmakers boost the number of deals they're offering on new autos, used car shoppers may benefit as well, Drury said. ""When we start to see discounts on the new cars, it trickles down to used cars,"" he said.

If it's been a while since you bought a vehicle, brush up on the best strategies for buying a used car. 

""Do your due diligence,"" Banks said. Some strategies he recommends:

In this article

Palantir is relocating its headquarters to Miami from Denver, the company announced Tuesday in a post on social media platform X.

The software analytics firm is the latest big business to migrate to South Florida as executives seek to transform the region into a hub for innovation.

Florida, which offers a friendlier tax environment, has welcomed a wave of billionaires in recent years. The region is also gaining more executives as California deliberates over a 5% wealth tax on residents with a net worth exceeding $1 billion.

Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly bought a mansion in Florida and Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel has established a base in Miami.

Palantir, which was founded in Palo Alto, California, in 2003, previously moved to Denver in 2020. CEO Alex Karp has previously spoken out about the culture in Silicon Valley.

""Our company was founded in Silicon Valley,"" he wrote in a letter in 2020. ""But we seem to share fewer and fewer of the technology sector's values and commitments.""

Major tech companies are also building bigger hubs in the region. ServiceNow said in September it would add more office space in West Palm Beach. Ken Griffin-run hedge fund Citadel is also based out of Miami.

At the end of last year, Palantir said it had 4,429 full-time workers, with significant offices in Palo Alto, New York City, Washington, D.C., and London. 

Palantir also leases space in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, according to its website.

The cryptocurrency sector has never lacked innovation. From the early days of Bitcoin to the smart contract revolution sparked by Ethereum, digital assets have consistently reshaped how capital is formed and distributed. One of the most debated developments in recent years is the resurgence of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), accompanied by a noticeable rise in influencer-led outreach.

A growing number of blockchain projects are collaborating with online personalities to introduce their token offerings to broader audiences. This trend raises an important question: Is influencer-led ICO outreach truly driving the latest fundraising boom, or is it simply amplifying an already active market cycle?

This article explores the mechanisms behind influencer involvement, the structural shifts in crypto fundraising, and the potential long-term implications for investors and project teams.

ICOs initially gained global attention between 2016 and 2018. During that period, projects raised billions of dollars by offering newly issued tokens directly to the public. However, regulatory scrutiny, failed projects, and market downturns significantly reduced ICO activity.

In recent years, alternative token launch models such as Initial DEX Offerings (IDOs) and Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) gained traction. Platforms like Binance introduced structured token sales that added a layer of credibility and due diligence.

Now, ICOs are seeing renewed interest, particularly among early-stage blockchain ventures seeking decentralized fundraising without traditional venture capital gatekeeping. What differentiates this new wave from its predecessor is the central role played by digital influencers.

The cryptocurrency ecosystem has cultivated a strong community presence across platforms such as YouTube, X (formerly Twitter), Telegram, and Discord. Influencers in this space range from independent analysts and blockchain developers to high-profile investors and content creators.

Some figures, including personalities like Vitalik Buterin or Elon Musk, have demonstrated how online commentary can significantly impact digital asset valuations. While not directly tied to ICO outreach, their influence illustrates how narrative and visibility can move markets.

In the context of ICOs, influencer participation often includes:

Reviewing project whitepapers

Hosting live discussions with founders

Explaining token utility models

Sharing allocation breakdowns

Discussing potential risks

Rather than acting as traditional advertisers, many influencers position themselves as interpreters of complex blockchain concepts. Their role blends analysis, commentary, and community engagement.

Crypto investors often rely on peer networks rather than institutional research. Influencers cultivate trust by consistently sharing insights, technical breakdowns, and market commentary. When they introduce an ICO to their audience, it carries an implicit layer of social validation.

This trust dynamic can accelerate fundraising momentum. Early participation by a trusted voice can create a ripple effect, encouraging additional contributors to evaluate the opportunity.

ICOs involve technical components such as tokenomics, smart contracts, vesting schedules, and governance mechanisms. Influencers frequently break down these elements into digestible formats video explainers, infographics, and live Q&A sessions.

For retail investors who may not have advanced technical knowledge, this educational framing lowers the barrier to entry.

Blockchain projects are inherently global. Influencers often command international audiences spanning multiple jurisdictions. A single livestream or thread can reach participants across continents, enabling rapid capital formation without geographic limitations.

This global connectivity contributes to the perception of a fundraising boom, as capital pools aggregate from diverse regions simultaneously.

While influencer outreach plays a visible role, it operates within broader market conditions.

Crypto markets tend to move in cyclical patterns influenced by macroeconomic trends, technological innovation, and investor sentiment. When token prices rise across the board, capital becomes more risk-tolerant. During bullish phases, speculative interest in early-stage projects increases naturally.

Influencer activity often intensifies during these cycles, but it may be amplifying momentum rather than initiating it.

The growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols has normalized on-chain participation. Users familiar with staking, liquidity provision, and governance tokens are more comfortable engaging in ICOs.

This ecosystem familiarity reduces friction and makes community-driven fundraising models more viable.

Some jurisdictions have introduced clearer guidelines for token issuance and digital asset classification. Although global regulation remains fragmented, incremental clarity reduces uncertainty for both founders and contributors.

When combined with influencer-driven awareness, this regulatory evolution can accelerate participation.

Influencer-led outreach operates at the intersection of behavioral economics and community dynamics.

Early token sales often emphasize limited allocation windows. Influencers discussing “early-stage opportunities” can heighten urgency among followers. Even without overt sales language, enthusiasm can trigger rapid participation.

Successful ICOs frequently present compelling visions scalable infrastructure, decentralized governance, or real-world utility. Influencers who articulate these narratives effectively can shape how audiences interpret a project's long-term potential.

When influencers analyze tokenomics or question project founders publicly, it can signal scrutiny. Viewers may interpret this transparency as a form of informal vetting, even though it does not replace professional auditing.

The resurgence of influencer-led ICO outreach is not without controversy.

In some cases, influencers receive token allocations or financial incentives for coverage. Without transparent disclosure, audiences may misinterpret commentary as purely independent analysis.

Regulatory bodies in various countries have begun examining how digital asset endorsements align with securities laws and consumer protection standards.

Retail participants may lack access to the same data as insiders or early contributors. Influencer enthusiasm can unintentionally overshadow technical or financial risks.

ICOs remain high-risk ventures. Token prices can fluctuate dramatically after launch. Even well-intentioned influencers cannot eliminate fundamental project risks such as execution failure, liquidity constraints, or governance challenges.

Blockchain analytics platforms show an increase in token launch activity compared to the subdued period following the 2018 downturn. Capital inflows into early-stage Web3 ventures have also risen, particularly in sectors such as:

Layer-2 scaling solutions

Decentralized AI infrastructure

Cross-chain interoperability

Real-world asset tokenization

Social media engagement metrics reveal that ICO-related discussions have expanded in parallel. Spikes in community membership and token wallet creation often coincide with influencer-hosted events.

However, correlation does not necessarily confirm causation. Influencer outreach may amplify visibility, but underlying technological developments and market optimism also contribute significantly.

If influencer-led ICO outreach continues to expand, several long-term outcomes may emerge:

As scrutiny grows, clearer disclosure frameworks may develop. Influencers could adopt standardized reporting practices when discussing token allocations or compensation.

Projects may provide more comprehensive documentation, third-party audits, and governance clarity to maintain credibility within influencer communities.

Some influencers are evolving into research-oriented analysts, publishing detailed reports and hosting technical workshops. This shift could elevate the overall quality of public discourse around token sales.

The evidence suggests that influencer-led outreach acts as a catalyst rather than a sole driver. It accelerates information flow, amplifies community engagement, and lowers educational barriers. However, the core drivers of fundraising booms remain:

Technological innovation

Market liquidity

Investor risk appetite

Regulatory developments

Influencers operate within these broader forces. Their impact is significant, but it is intertwined with structural market dynamics.

The latest wave of ICO fundraising reflects a convergence of maturing blockchain infrastructure, renewed investor interest, and digitally native communication channels. Influencer-led outreach has become a central feature of this landscape, shaping how projects are introduced and evaluated.

Yet sustainable growth will depend on transparency, robust project fundamentals, and informed participation. As the ecosystem evolves, both influencers and investors carry shared responsibility in fostering credibility and resilience.

The fundraising boom may be visible on social feeds and token dashboards, but its durability will ultimately be determined by real-world utility, technological execution, and community governance.

Influencer-led ICO outreach is not the entire story but it is undeniably a powerful chapter in the ongoing evolution of decentralized capital formation.

Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel backs euro stablecoins and retail CBDC, highlighting Europe's drive for secure, efficient, and independent digital payment systems.

Germany's central bank leadership expressed support for digital payment innovation this week. Joachim Nagel signaled approval for euro stablecoins and a retail CBDC. The comments underscored Europe's ongoing effort to modernise and strengthen its payment systems to ensure they remain independent and reliable.

Speaking at the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany's reception, Nagel discussed economic transitions. He said policymakers were working hard to bring about a retail digital euro. Additionally, he explained that euro-denominated stablecoins were tools that made efficient cross-border transactions possible.

Nagel said Europe needs to reinforce independence in terms of payment systems and financial solutions. As a result, digital currencies and regulated stablecoins received renewed attention from institutions. The speech defined technology's role as central to financial stability and long-term economic competitiveness.

Trade links between the European Union and the United States remained economically important. Nearly 20 percent of German exports to non-EU countries still poured into the American markets. Together, both economies accounted for 30% of the world trade and 44% GDP.

Nagel noted that geopolitical fragmentation was a growing weight on the growth outlook in Europe. However, he emphasized that Europe still had a strong belief in open and rules-based commerce. Therefore, regulatory simplification and investment became urgent strategic priorities of the policymakers.

He was in favor of simplifying complex regulatory rules that discouraged business expansion and innovation. Moreover, European Commission initiatives were aimed at reducing administrative burdens in member states. Such reforms, he argued, could unlock investment, efficiency and productivity gains.

Nagel pointed out work studied for an exploratory central bank digital currency. This model would allow for programmable payments in safe central bank money. Financial institutions could reap benefits from improved speed of settlement and lower operational risks.

Alongside CBDCs, Nagel came out firmly in favour of euro-denominated stablecoin adoption. He said such assets have the potential to reduce costs for individuals and businesses. Importantly, cross-border payments could potentially become faster, cheaper, and more accessible.

The president of the Bundesbank connected these efforts with the overall competitiveness strategy of Europe. Furthermore, he underlined the need for a stronger investment in digital and energy infrastructure. Private capital, he pointed out, would play a decisive supporting role.

Nagel's comments were a sign of gathering momentum for the regulated digital assets. Meanwhile, debates were raging over design decisions, privacy protections and financial stability implications. Still, policymakers were increasingly beginning to see innovation as inevitable in the modern payment ecosystems.

Europe's independence in the payment sphere was a recurring theme among central bankers. As a result, the stablecoins and CBDCs were discussed as complementary and not competing solutions. This view was consistent with wider European digital finance policy goals.

Nagel concluded that Europe must do its adaptation confidently in the face of a changing world environment. He promoted dialogue, cooperation, and pragmatic reforms in favour of sustainable economic resilience. Ultimately, digital euro initiatives and stablecoins can transform payments in Europe in the future.

The speech attracted the headlines of financial markets as well as technology policy observers. However, officials emphasized that development schedules would be dependent on legislative progress. Consultations across the institutions were expected to inform the careful shaping of the implementation frameworks.

Europe's digital payments landscape seemed destined for slow but significant change. Consequently, policymakers, banks, and firms planned to change technological standards. Nagel's position supported expectations about continued experimentation with digital money and broader innovations.

Mountain photographer stumbles on one of the largest ever collections of Triassic dinosaur prints

A newfound site in the Italian Alps holds one of the largest collections of Triassic dinosaur footprints ever seen

By Humberto Basilio edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

About 2,000 fossil footprints appear on this part of the mountain site's walls, researchers say.

Last September photographer Elio Della Ferrera spotted thousands of dinosaur tracks traversing vertical rock faces in the Fraele Valley of Stelvio National Park, high in the Italian Alps. Some of the prints, spanning as many as 40 centimeters across, date back about 210 million years, making the newly identified site one of the richest deposits of Triassic dinosaur tracks in the world.

The footprints are so well preserved that “it took me a few seconds to realize the photos were real,” says paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso of the Natural History Museum of Milan, who is leading the investigation of the site. “Now we can go back in time and study the evolution of dinosaurs in this place.”

In a preliminary study, Dal Sasso and his team deduced that the prints were made by herds of large, herbivorous dinosaurs, probably prosauropods, ancestors of Jurassic sauropods such as Brontosaurus. The tracks formed when dinosaurs walked across muddy tidal flats along the shores of the prehistoric Tethys Ocean, long before the Alps rose.

Studying this newly named “Triassic Park” will be challenging because it is so difficult to access, Dal Sasso says—researchers will have to rely on drones and remote sensing to study and digitally preserve the footprints.

Some of the best-preserved fossilized footprints at the newfound site show impressions of the Triassic walkers' long heels, toes and claws.

AI enters the exam room

When alerts misfire or can't explain themselves, nurses still carry the risk

By Hilke Schellmann edited by Eric Sullivan

Tavis Coburn

Adam Hart has been a nurse at St. Rose Dominican Hospital in Henderson, Nev., for 14 years. A few years ago, while assigned to help out in the emergency department, he was listening to the ambulance report on a patient who'd just arrived—an elderly woman with dangerously low blood pressure—when a sepsis flag flashed in the hospital's electronic system.

Sepsis, a life-threatening response to infection, is a major cause of death in U.S. hospitals, and early treatment is critical. The flag prompted the charge nurse to instruct Hart to room the patient immediately, take her vitals and begin intravenous (IV) fluids. It was protocol; in an emergency room, that often means speed.

But when Hart examined the woman, he saw that she had a dialysis catheter below her collarbone. Her kidneys weren't keeping up. A routine flood of IV fluids, he warned, could overwhelm her system and end up in her lungs. The charge nurse told him to do it anyway because of the sepsis alert generated by the hospital's artificial-intelligence system. Hart refused.

[Live event: Life in the Age of AI. Join SciAm for an insightful conversation on the trends and innovations shaping AI in the year ahead. Learn more.]

A physician overheard the escalating conversation and stepped in. Instead of fluids, the doctor ordered dopamine to raise the patient's blood pressure without adding volume—averting what Hart believed could have led to a life-threatening complication.

What stayed with Hart was the choreography that the AI-generated alert produced. A screen prompted urgency, which a protocol turned into an order; a bedside objection grounded in clinical reasoning landed, at least in the moment, as defiance. No one was acting in bad faith. Still, the tool pushed them to comply when the evidence right in front of them—the patient and her compromised kidneys—demanded the exact opposite. (A hospital spokesperson said that they could not comment on a specific case but that the hospital views AI as “one of the many tools that supports, not supersedes, the expertise and judgment of our care teams.”)

That dynamic is becoming familiar in U.S. health care. Over the past several years hospitals have woven algorithmic models into routine practice. Clinical care often relies on matching a patient's symptoms against rigid protocols—an environment ideal for automation. For an exhausted workforce, the appeal of handing off routine tasks such as documentation to AI is undeniable.

The technologies already implemented span a spectrum from predictive models that calculate simple risk scores to agentic AI that promises autonomous decision-making—enabling systems to titrate a patient's oxygen flow or reprioritize an ER triage queue with little human input. A pilot project launched in Utah a few months ago uses chatbot technology with agentic capabilities to renew prescriptions, a move proponents say gives providers more time, although physician associations have opposed the removal of human oversight. Across the country, health systems are using similar tools to flag risks, ambiently listen to visits with patients, generate clinical notes, monitor patients via wearable devices, match participants to clinical trials, and even manage the logistics of operating rooms and intensive care unit transfers.

Nurses saw how an imperfect product could become policy—and then become their problem.

The industry is chasing a vision of truly continuous care: a decision-making infrastructure that keeps tabs on patients between appointments by combining what's in the medical record—laboratory test results, imaging, notes, meds—with population data and with the data people generate on their own by using, for instance, wearables and food logs. It watches for meaningful changes, sends guidance or prompts, and flags cases that need human input. Proponents argue this kind of data-intensive, always-on monitoring is beyond the cognitive scope of any human provider.

Others say clinicians must stay in the loop, using AI not as autopilot but as a tool to help them make sense of vast troves of data. Last year Stanford Medicine rolled out ChatEHR, a tool that allows clinicians to “chat” with a patient's medical records. One physician shared that the tool found critical information buried in the records of a cancer patient, which helped a team including six pathologists to give a definitive diagnosis. “If that doesn't prove the value of EHR, I don't know what does,” they reported.

At the same time, on many hospital floors these digital promises often fracture, according to Anaeze Offodile, chief strategy officer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. He notes that faulty algorithms, poor implementation and low return on investment have caused some projects to stall. On the ground, nurses, who are tasked with caring for patients, are increasingly wary of unvalidated tools. This friction has moved from the ward into the streets. In the past two years nurses in California and New York City have staged demonstrations to draw attention to unregulated algorithmic tools entering the health-care system, arguing that while hospitals invest in AI the bedside remains dangerously short-staffed.

Sepsis prediction has become a cautionary case. Hospitals across the U.S. widely adopted information health technology company Epic's sepsis-prediction algorithm. Later evaluations found it substantially less accurate than marketed. Epic says that studies in clinical settings have found its sepsis model improved outcomes and that it has since released a second version it claims performs better. Still, nurses saw how an imperfect product could become policy—and then become their problem.

Burnout, staffing shortages and rising workplace violence are already thinning the nursing workforce, according to a 2024 nursing survey. Those pressures spilled onto the steps of New York City Hall last November, when members of the New York State Nurses Association rallied and then testified before the City Council's hospitals committee. They argued that some of the city's biggest private systems are pouring money into executives and AI projects while hospital units remain understaffed and nurses face escalating safety risks. As this story was going to press in mid-January, 15,000 nurses at hospital systems in New York City were on strike, demanding safer staffing levels and workplace protections.

New AI-enabled monitoring models often arrive in hospitals with the same kind of hype that has accompanied AI in other industries. In 2023 UC Davis Health rolled out BioButton in its oncology bone marrow transplant unit, calling it “transformational.” The device, a small, hexagonal silicone sensor worn on a patient's chest, continuously tracked vital signs such as heart rate, temperature and breathing patterns.

On the floor it frequently generated alerts that were difficult for nurses to interpret. For Melissa Beebe, a registered nurse who has worked at UC Davis Health for 17 years, the pings offered little actionable data. “This is where it became really problematic,” she says. “It was vague.” The notifications flagged changes in vital signs without specifics.

Beebe says she often followed alarms that led nowhere. “I have my own internal alerts—‘something's wrong with this patient, I want to keep an eye on them'—and then the BioButton would have its own thing going on. It was overdoing it but not really giving great information.”

As a union representative for the California Nurses Association at UC Davis Health, Beebe requested a formal discussion with hospital leadership before the devices were rolled out, as allowed by the union's contract. “It's just really hyped: ‘Oh, my gosh, this is going to be so transformative, and aren't you so lucky to be able to do it?'” she says. She felt that when she and other nurses raised questions, they were seen as resistant to technology. “I'm a WHY nurse. To understand something, I have to know why. Why am I doing it?”

Among the nurses' concerns were how the device would work on different body types and how quickly they were expected to respond to alerts. Beebe says leadership had few clear answers. Instead nurses were told the device could help with early detection of hemorrhagic strokes, which patients were particularly at risk for on her floor. “But the problem is that heart rate, temperature and respiratory rate, for a stroke, would be some pretty late signs of an issue,” she says. “You'd be kind of dying at that point.” Earlier signs of a hemorrhagic stroke may be difficulty rousing the patient, slurred speech or balance problems. “None of those things are BioButton parameters.”

In the end, UC Davis Health stopped using the BioButtons after piloting the technology for about a year, Beebe says. “What they were finding was that in the patients who were really sick and would benefit from that kind of alert, the nurses were catching it much faster,” she explains. (UC Davis Health said in a statement that it piloted BioButton alongside existing monitors and ultimately chose not to adopt it because its alerts did not offer a clear advantage over current monitoring.)

Beebe argues that clinical judgment, shaped by years of training and experience and informed by subtle sensory cues and signals from technical equipment, cannot be automated. “I can't tell you how many times I have that feeling, I don't feel right about this patient. It could be just the way their skin looks or feels to me.” Elven Mitchell, an intensive care nurse of 13 years now at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Modesto, Calif., echoes that view. “Sometimes you can see a patient and, just looking at them, [know they're] not doing well. It doesn't show in the labs, and it doesn't show on the monitor,” he says. “We have five senses, and computers only get input.”

Clinical care often relies on matching a patient's symptoms against rigid protocols—an environment ideal for automation.

Algorithms can augment clinical judgment, experts say, but they cannot replace it. “The models will never have access to all of the data that the provider has,” says Ziad Obermeyer, Blue Cross of California Distinguished Associate Professor of Health Policy and Management at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health. The models are mostly analyzing electronic medical records, but not everything is in the digital file. “And that turns out to be a bunch of really important stuff like, How are they answering questions? How are they walking? All these subtle things that physicians and nurses see and understand about patients.”

Mitchell, who also serves on his hospital's rapid-response team, says his colleagues have trouble trusting the alerts. He estimates that roughly half of the alerts generated by a centralized monitoring team are false positives, yet hospital policy requires bedside staff to evaluate each one, pulling nurses away from patients already flagged as high risk. (Kaiser Permanente said in a statement that its AI monitoring tools are meant to support clinicians, with decisions remaining with care teams, and that the systems are rigorously tested and continuously monitored.)

“Maybe in 50 years it will be more beneficial, but as it stands, it is a trying-to-make-it-work system,” Mitchell says. He wishes there were more regulation in the space because health-care decisions can, in extreme cases, be about life or death.

Across interviews for this article, nurses consistently emphasized that they are not opposed to technology in the hospital. Many said they welcome tools that are carefully validated and demonstrably improve care. What has made them wary, they argue, is the rapid rollout of heavily marketed AI models whose performance in real-world settings falls short of promises. Rolling out unvalidated tools can have lasting consequences. “You are creating mistrust in a generation of clinicians and providers,” warns one expert, who requested anonymity out of concern about professional repercussions.

Concerns extend beyond private vendors. Hospitals themselves are sometimes bypassing safeguards that once governed the introduction of new medical technologies, says Nancy Hagans, nurse and president of the New York State Nurses Association.

The risks are not merely theoretical. Obermeyer, the professor at Berkeley's School of Public Health, found that some algorithms used in patient care turned out to be racist. “They're being used to screen about 100 million to 150 million people every year for these kinds of decisions, so it's very widespread,” he says. “It does bring up the question of why we don't have a system for catching those things before they are deployed and start affecting all these important decisions,” he adds, comparing the introduction of AI tools in health care to medical drug development. Unlike with drugs, there is no single gatekeeper for AI; hospitals are often left to validate tools on their own.

At the bedside, opacity has consequences: If the alert is hard to explain, the aftermath still belongs to the clinician. If a device performs differently across patients—missing some, overflagging others—the clinician inherits that, too.

Hype surrounding AI has further complicated matters. Over the past couple of years AI-based listening tools that record doctor-patient interactions and generate a clinical note to document the visit spread quickly through health care. Many institutions bought them hoping they'd save clinicians time. Many providers appreciate being freed from taking notes while talking to patients, but emerging evidence suggests the efficiency gains may be modest. Studies have reported time savings ranging from negligible to up to 22 minutes per day. “Everybody rushed in saying these things are magical; they're gonna save us hours. Those savings did not materialize,” says Nigam Shah, a professor of medicine at Stanford University and chief data scientist for Stanford Health Care. “What's the return on investment of saving six minutes per day?”

Similar experiences have made some elite institutions wary of relying only on outside companies for algorithmic tools. A few years back Stanford Health Care, Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, and others brought AI development in-house so they could develop their own tools, test tools from vendors, tune them and defend them to clinicians. “It's a strategic redefinition of health-care AI as an institutional capability rather than a commodity technology we purchase,” Shah says. At Mount Sinai, that shift has meant focusing less on algorithms themselves and more on adoption and trust—trying to create trust with health-care workers and fitting new tools into the workflow.

AI tools also need to say why they're recommending something and identify the specific signals that triggered the alert, not just present a score. Hospitals need to pay attention to human-machine interactions, says Suchi Saria, John C. Malone Associate Professor of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University and director of the school's Machine Learning and Healthcare Lab. AI models, she argues, should function more like well-trained team members. “It's not gonna work if this new team member is disruptive. People aren't gonna use it,” Saria says. “If this new member is unintelligible, people aren't gonna use it.”

Yet many institutions do not consult or co-create with their nurses and other frontline staff when considering or building new AI tools that will be used in patient care. “Happens all the time,” says Stanford's Shah. He recalls initially staffing his data-science team with doctors, not nurses, until his institution's chief nursing officer pushed back. He now believes nurses' perspectives are indispensable. “Ask nurses first, doctors second, and if the doctor and nurse disagree, believe the nurse, because they know what's really happening,” he says.

To include more staff members in the process of developing AI tools, some institutions have implemented a bottom-up approach in addition to a top-down approach. “Many of the best ideas come from people closest to the work, so we created a process where anyone in the company can submit an idea,” says Robbie Freeman, a former bedside nurse and now chief digital transformation officer at Mount Sinai. A wound-care nurse had the great idea to build an AI tool to predict which patients are likely to develop bedsores. The program has a high adoption rate, Freeman says, partly because that nurse is enthusiastically training her peers.

Freeman says the goal is not to replace clinical judgment but to build tools clinicians will use—tools that can explain themselves. In the version nurses want, the alert is an invitation to look closer, not an untrustworthy digital manager.

The next frontier arrived at Mount Sinai's cardiac-catheterization lab last year with a new agentic AI system called Sofiya. Instead of nurses calling patients ahead of a stenting procedure to provide instructions and answer questions, Sofiya now gives them a ring. The AI agent, designed with a “soft-spoken, calming” voice and depicted as a female model in scrubs on life-size promotional cutouts, saved Mount Sinai more than 200 nursing hours in five months, according to Annapoorna Kini, director of the cath lab. But some nurses aren't onboard with Sofiya. Last November, at a New York City Council meeting, Denash Forbes, a nurse at Mount Sinai for 37 years, testified that Sofiya's work must still be checked by nurses to ensure accuracy.

Even Freeman admits there is a “ways to go” until this agentic AI will provide an integrated and seamless experience. Or maybe it will join the ranks of failed AI pilots. As the industry chases the efficiency of autonomous agents, we need an algorithm-testing infrastructure. For now the safety of the patient remains anchored in the very thing AI cannot replicate: the intuition of the human clinician. Like in the case of Adam Hart, who rejected a digital verdict in order to protect a patient's lungs, the ultimate value of the nurse in the age of AI may be not their ability to follow the prompt but their willingness to override it.

Adolescents have long been stereotyped in literature and science as being impulsive and emotional. One aspect of their unique communication style has attracted attention in popular culture: ‘teensplaining'. Similar to mansplaining, when a man condescendingly explains things to a woman regardless of her expertise, it involves youths assuming they know more than adults do (often, parents and teachers) and teensplaining things in a disrespectful tone.

WordPress.com, the website hosting platform from Automattic, will now include a built-in WordPress AI assistant, the company announced on Tuesday. The feature is designed to work inside the website to understand its content and layout, allowing site owners to make changes with natural language commands.

With the new tool, you can adjust the site's layout, its style, or other patterns by issuing commands to the AI assistant, and then see the changes reflected on the site as you work. These instructions don't have to be precisely tailored prompts, either, the company notes. Instead, you can use more general language, like “make this section feel more modern or spacious,” “change my site's colors to be brighter and bolder,” or “give me more font options that feel clean and professional.”

You can also direct the AI to add or adjust your layout, instructing it to do things like “add a contact page,” or “add a testimonials section below this section.” However, the company notes that its adjustments work with block themes, not classic ones. If you're using the latter, the assistant won't appear in the editor. 

The WordPress AI assistant can update the site's content, as well, like asking it to rewrite your bio to sound more confident, or translating a section into another language. 

The AI can also function like an editor, offering headline suggestions, fact checks, and other grammar and editing suggestions. This aspect is available through the block notes editor that arrived in WordPress 6.9, where you're able to collaborate with teammates in the editor. Now, you can pull the AI into that workflow by typing @ai followed by your requests. The AI will provide its answers here, including relevant links and other information where it cites external sources. 

Meanwhile, for help with visuals, the assistant leverages Google Gemini's Nano Banana AI models, which can be used to either make new images or edit existing ones. With the AI helper, available as a new “Generate Image” button in the Media Library, you can specify image requirements like aspect ratios or dictate image styles. 

The company notes the WordPress AI Assistant is an opt-in feature users can enable if they choose. To do so, they will need to visit their Sites list once logged in, click their site name, and then Settings. Under settings, they'll scroll down to “AI tools” and toggle the “Enable AI assistant” setting on.

Customers who purchase a website with the AI website builder will have the assistant enabled automatically.

Social network Snapchat announced today it's launching creator subscriptions in alpha with select people in the U.S. starting on February 23. The company noted that users will be able to buy subscriptions to creators, including Jeremiah Brown, Harry Jowsey, and Skai Jackson. This will allow users to unlock exclusive content while creating monetization opportunities for creators.

Creators can set their own monthly prices for subscription within the app, while Snap will recommend different tiers to them. The subscription will unlock subscriber-only content, priority replies to a creator's public Stories, and ad-free consumption for that creator's Stories.

Snap noted that this is a new way for creators to earn more money besides the existing programs.

“Expanding on existing monetization offerings like the Unified Monetization Program and the Snap Star Collab Studio, Creator Subscriptions introduce a premium layer of connection directly into how Snapchatters already engage with creators across Stories, Chat, and replies,” the company said in the blog post.

Snapchat reached 946 million daily active users, according to the company's Q4 2025 results. The platform noted during its earnings that the number of U.S.-based users posting to Spotlight grew over 47% year-over-year. The company also spun out hardware to a new entity called Specs last month. 

The company added that it plans to expand the program to Snap Stars in Canada, the U.K., and France in the coming weeks.

Rival company Meta also allows creators to offer subscriptions on platforms like Instagram and Facebook, which gives users access to exclusive content and badges.

Airbnb said on Tuesday that it is launching its “Reserve Now, Pay Later” feature — which lets users secure bookings without immediate payment — globally. This allows users to cancel their bookings if there is a change of plans without losing money up front.

The company launched the feature in the U.S. last year for domestic travel. Airbnb said that properties with a “flexible” or “moderate” cancellation policy are eligible for the upfront reservation. With this option, users get charged closer to their check-in date rather than at the time of booking. The feature mirrors “buy now, pay later” payment plans that have become popular in e-commerce, making expensive travel more accessible by spreading out costs. The company noted that since the launch, the feature saw 70% adoption for eligible bookings.

During its earnings calls for Q4 2025, Airbnb said that the feature helped grow nights booked in the quarter.

“Reserve Now, Pay Later saw significant adoption among eligible guests in Q4. It's also led to longer booking lead times and a mix shift towards larger entire homes, especially those with four or more bedrooms, contributing to the increase in average daily rate,” Ellie Mertz, CFO of Airbnb, said during the call.

Mertz noted that Airbnb's overall cancellation rate jumped from 16% to 17% for the quarter, and it was higher among customers who use the upfront booking product. However, she said that this was “not hugely material relative to the broader cancellations on the platform.”

Last year, the company surveyed U.S. travelers along with Focaldata, a London-based market research and polling company. Of those surveyed, 60% of participants said that a flexible payment option is important while booking a holiday, and 55% said they would use a flexible payment option.

The company has been experimenting with pay-later products for years now. Back in 2018, Airbnb launched a product that allowed users to book a property by paying 20% or 50% of the total charges up front, with the rest due later. In 2023, the company partnered with fintech firm Klarna to let users pay for their stays in four installments over six weeks.

Over the past few months, several countries have announced plans to restrict social media access for children and teens. Australia became the first to implement such measures at the end of last year, setting a precedent that other countries are now closely watching. 

Australia's regulations, along with other countries' proposals, aim to reduce the pressures and risks that young users may face on social media, which include cyberbullying, addiction, mental health issues, and exposure to predators. 

Of course, there are concerns about privacy regarding invasive age verification and excessive government intervention. Critics, including Amnesty Tech, have said such bans are ineffective and that they ignore the realities of younger generations. Despite this, many nations are moving ahead with proposed legislation. 

We've compiled a list of countries that are considering or have already moved forward with bans on social media for young users.

Australia became the world's first country to ban social media for children under 16 in December 2025. The ban blocks children from using Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube, Reddit, Twitch, and Kick. It notably doesn't include WhatsApp or YouTube Kids. 

The Australian government has said these social media companies must take steps to keep children off their services. Companies that fail to comply may face penalties of up to $49.5 million AUD ($34.4 million USD).

The government says these platforms should use multiple verification methods to ensure that people using their services are older than 16. It also notes that they can't rely on users simply entering their own age. 

Denmark is set to ban social media platforms for children under 15. The Danish government announced in November 2025 that it had secured support  for the ban from three governing coalition parties and two opposition parties in parliament.

The government's plans could become law as soon as mid-2026, according to the Associated Press. The Danish digital affairs ministry is also launching a “digital evidence” app that includes age verification tools that may be used as part of the ban. 

In late January, French lawmakers passed a bill that would ban social media for kids under 15. President Emmanuel Macron has supported the measure as a way to protect children from excessive screen time. 

The bill still has to get through the country's Senate before a final vote in the lower house.

In early February, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's conservatives discussed a proposal to bar children under 16 from using social media, Reuters reported. However, there were signs that his center-left coalition partners were hesitant to support an outright ban.

Greece is said to be close to announcing a social media ban for children under 15, Reuters reported in early February.   

The Malaysian government said in November 2025 that it plans to ban social media for children under 16. The country plans to implement the ban this year. 

Slovenia is drafting legislation to prohibit children under 15 from accessing social media, the country's deputy prime minister announced in early February. The government wants to regulate social networks where content is shared, citing platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram.

Spain's prime minister announced in early February that the country plans to ban social media for children under the age of 16. The ban still needs parliamentary approval. The Spanish government is also seeking to create a law that would make social media executives personally accountable for hate speech on their platforms.

The United Kingdom is weighing a ban on social media for children under 16. The government says it will consult parents, young people, and civil society for their views to determine whether a ban would be effective. 

It will also consider whether to require social media companies to limit or remove features that drive compulsive use, such as endless scrolling.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:ycombinator.com","Thinking hard burns almost no calories but destroys your next workout","https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47042766","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 02:08:10 GMT","

Reading this article I'm a little confused by the author's conflation of brain energy and the energy expenditure of the body as a whole. In the beginning they mention:> ""Your brain consumes roughly 20 to 25% of your body's total energy at rest""while later they say:> ""Even chess grandmasters, who sit for hours in states of intense concentration, burn only about 1.67 calories per minute while playing, compared to 1.53 calories per minute at rest""That second figure seems to refer to whole-body expenditure, not just the brain. And intense cognitive work doesn't happen in a metabolic vacuum - there's increased cerebral blood flow, elevated sympathetic nervous system activity, changes in heart rate variability, hormonal shifts (cortisol, adrenaline). These all have systemic metabolic costs that go beyond the glucose the neurons themselves consume. So the ""it's just a banana and a half"" framing might be undercounting by quietly switching between brain-only and whole-body measurements.Also somewhat related - the link to businessinsider about chess grandmasters is broken, but another very interesting rabbit hole here is how energy expenditure is actually measured. A lot of what consumer devices and even many studies report is based on proxy biomarkers like heart rate, HRV, weight, age, and sex, run through linear regression models.

Can you expand on that please?
Because I can tell you as a matter of fact that when I go for a run for an hour I burn well over 800 calories.

reply

Sure - how did you arrive at the 800 kcal figure? Most likely a wearable or an app, and those estimates are based on rough linear regressions from weight, age, sex, and heart rate - not actual calorimetry. The error margins on those numbers are significant, but the devices present them with false precision that makes people treat them as ground truth.Even setting accuracy aside, the framing is the issue. Your basal metabolic rate - just keeping your organs running, blood circulating, cells maintained - accounts for 60-70% of your total daily energy expenditure. Add the thermic effect of food (~10%) and you're at roughly 70-80% of your energy budget spent before you even lace up your shoes [1]. Exercise typically makes up the remaining 20-30%. So that hour of running, while genuinely beneficial for a hundred other reasons, is a relatively small slice of your total daily burn. And not all calories are equal on the intake side either - your body spends 20-30% of the energy in protein just to digest it, compared to 0-5% for fat, so ""800 kcal burned = 800 kcal of anything eaten"" doesn't hold up.That's what I mean by ""myth"" - not that exercise burns zero calories, but that the popular mental model of ""I ran for an hour so I earned X calories of food"" is built on inaccurate measurements, treats all calories as interchangeable, and overweights exercise relative to what your body spends just existing. Curious though - do you track your intake with the same rigour, and if so, do you find the numbers actually add up in practice?[1]: https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/basal-metabolic-r...

Over the last few of decades there's been a lot of lab research calculating the gross efficiency of the human body with different factors (size, sex, fitness etc) and I think these estimates that sports apps give are very close.If you cycle with with something that can measure power output you can calculate the mechanical work done by the body exactly during that exercise period and convert to energy ""burnt"" (1 watt/hour = 3.6 kJ = ~0.86 kcal).  220 Watts for an hour (I couldn't do that but a good cyclist can) is about 800 calories.

Not that doing x work doesn't burn y energy, but that +x work in exercise does not burn +y energy at the end of the day.Exercise is an alternate heat source, approximately 1-to-1 with thermogenic heat (albeit, not distributed as evenly). So much so that our body has to switch to cooling strategies.And the body can respond to exercise expenditures by reducing other expenditures and using calories more parsimoniously in other dimensions.It is interesting that during periods in which I have a habit of daily low intensity exercise, I feel like I have more energy than periods I don't do any exercise, even if my calorie intake is the same.Another noticeable effect is any allergies from local plant life I get clear up quickly during and after exercise. My immune system runs a tighter, less reactive ship.Those baseline calories are not just often underestimated in a static sense, but are also dynamically adaptable.One reason may be is that we evolved to burn far more overt calories through a day than our extra-exercise day burns. Our body has mechanisms for storing surpluses but almost certainly raises baseline use as well. Which is easily diverted back to exercise.On the other hand, beyond any net expenditure from regular lifting weights (as work), to the degree greater muscle mass is achieved and maintained, weight lifting directly raises the body's baseline expenditures.

In the same vein as much of the rest of what you're saying, the other thing that I feel like people always neglect with their ""Calories in/calories out"" and ""Bodies can't violate thermodynamics"" is that the human body can adjust how efficiently it processes food, colloquially known as a ""slow"" or ""fast"" metabolism.While it's true that the human body has no answer to a true calorie deficit (except the incredibly powerful and effective one of tweaking satiety and hunger signals), as long as you're eating more calories than you're strictly burning, your body can simply take longer or less time to digest the food you put into it and extract more or less energy from what you're eating, which can make an enormous difference without you changing your intake at all. Which means that people can absolutely eat identically, have identical appetite levels, and have extremely different body types.If you're exercising more, sure, your body will make you more hungry, but it will also work harder to squeeze every possible calorie out of what you're already eating. If you cut down on what you eat, your body will work even harder at it, to the point that you could literally eat less, work out more, feel hungry and tired all the time, while getting fatter, because your body is worried that you're in a famine and in a physically stressful environment and is desperately trying to signal to you to conserve as much energy as possible, eat as much as possible when you find food, and at the same time trying its best to make the most of the food you give it.And at the same time, someone else's body might simply not do that. It's crazy!

I don't track consistently anymore only when I'm working towards a goal but when I have more than 2 weeks data these days it seems pretty spot on to the point I can calculate the tracked captors to target to get the desired rate of change in weight pretty consistently.

I agree with all you posted.> Curious though - do you track your intake with the same rigour, and if so, do you find the numbers actually add up in practice?To return the courtesy, for the purposes of discussion I picked a rough estimate and rounded down significantly the actual amount I typically run. More often it's 1.5 hours a run and supposedly >1000 calories given my weight, heart rate, terrain, and speed. I also assumed the calculations are way overestimating my actual calories spent so just went for something somewhat plausible for the sake of a HN comment. As you noted calories aren't accurately reported by devices. I do not pay attention to it in massive detail either. But in practice since I run an average of about 25km a week but can vary from 0 for some weeks to 50 for others and I keep relatively good eye on my diet I notice significant changes in weight over time that tallies with effort. Three months of below that 20ishk a week and I will put on 2-3kg. The next three months I increase to 35ish+ a week and it drops off again. Would I swear to it in a court of law that I'm not miscounting meals? No way. But I feel reasonably comfortable that this is an accurate description.

I don't have the background to fully evaluate how true that is. I read ""Burn"" by Herman Pontzer, which at least makes a very good case for it.

reply

I seems like it's only part of the story. If you increase exercise but also increase calorific input to match then you won't lose weight. But, the laws of energy conservation being what they are, I don't think anyone disputes that if you very significantly increase exercise but also maintain calorific input then you will lose weight as the energy must come from somewhere and there are only so many optimisations your body can make. You could of course maintain exercise levels and reduce calorific input for a similar effect, ignoring health benefits of exercise. Take an extreme case, Michael Phelps. He used to eat 12,000 cal a day because of the hours he spent swimming. Certainly not a small guy but pretty lean! So I'm totally prepared to accept there are bounds to all these statements but I still think I couldn't finish an 800 cal sandwich for lunch hehehe.By the way, I feel the Wikipedia page there uses a lot of words suggesting that the paradox isn't at all fully understood and that there could be compensating mechanisms we aren't aware of. But I'm not in a position to dig deeper.

reply

This is exactly what is disputed by the link you posted. They measured directly the energy expenditure (the number of calories burned by respiration) in a high-activity hunter-gatherer tribe, and in relatively low-activity industrialized societies, and found they were almost the same. So the number of calories the people consumed was not measured or relevant (and must also have been roughly the same if neither group was actively gaining weight).

reply

For me the line ""The studies suggest that controlling caloric intake may be more necessary for managing weight than exercise alone."" is a possible conclusion for the apparent paradox. Note the words ""may"" and ""alone"" which indicate uncertainty.  I deliberately used the phrase ""very significantly"" to suggest we would probably all agree that there is some bound on observing the paradox which is why I used Phelps as an example. To repeat and be clear, I think the paradox as described on the page does not say that with a very significant increase in energy expenditure there will be no weight loss with a constant calorific intake.

reply

The ""Energy paradox"" is not a logical paradox at all. It is just a confusing fact. The observed fact was that two different groups with apparently very different activity levels respire almost exactly the same amount. In other words, that an increased, but not necessarily extreme, level of mechanical work does not appear to correlate with an increased level of calorie burn. Not just that the relationship is non-linear, that the relationship does not seem to exist at all (at the measured level of exercise).I was very careful with my words this time, hopefully there is no more misunderstanding. I think we still disagree unless by ""very significantly increase exercise"" you mean something like running multiple hours per day every day.

And also that the calorimetry from wearables is highly flawed and it seems to that we don't have super accurate data and what sort of activities burn the most energy.I am also a big opponent of folks that start equating the ""my wearable shows that i burned 300 kcal with that activity so it zero outs that sweet thing I ate earlier that was also 300 kcal"" which is wrong on so many reasons but with a lot of workout apps and devices pushing the (inaccurate) kcal count front and center becomes more and more a of a thing.

So if you view this from a time use perspective, just skipping that sandwich is way better than running for an hour. And many people can't spare an hour a day just to make up for a sandwich. Hence - ""not a lot"" - Its too expensive time-wise for the caloric balance effect it provides. Just skip the sandwich instead.

If you want to lose weight, it's far easier to remove 800 Cal from your diet, at least time wise, then it is to exercise 800 Cal's worth every day.Either way, if you're losing weight at any appreciable rate, you will feel hungry (at least if it's not chemically induced in some way, such as chemo or GLP-1 inhibitors or similar). That's just something you have to get used to if you want to lose weight.

The calories in/out model isn't wrong exactly, but it's so reductionist that it becomes misleading in practice. It omits hormonal responses (insulin, leptin, ghrelin), the thermic effect differences between macronutrients (your body burns 20-30% of protein calories just processing them vs 0-5% for fat), gut microbiome composition, sleep quality, stress hormones, meal timing, and individual metabolic variation. Two people eating identical calorie counts can have very different outcomes. Telling someone ""just eat less and accept the hunger"" without any of that context can set them up for a miserable yo-yo cycle - or worse, a disordered relationship with food.

reply

My point was instead that whatever effort you can spend on weight loss is better spent on managing your diet than increasing your level of activity (though I should also say that fitness is important beyond weight loss). Even when I said you can reduce 800 Cal of food, that doesn't mean ""just skip a meal"" (though that is also a valid strategy for some people). It can also mean ""eat different kinds of food"".However, I do strongly believe that for any weight loss at a significant pace (say, 1kg/month or faster), and assuming it's not just a correction after a short stint of overeating (as in, it's more than losing 1-2kg you put on over Christmas) - then some feeling of hunger is inevitable. Losing long-term accumulated weight is going against your body's ""wishes"" (especially in the lipostat model, where your body has a set fat% equilibrium that it seeks to maintain), and hunger is an inevitable response to that. How much hunger you will feel can be controlled by better food choices and so on, but you will have to also get used to feeling some level of hunger.

How much hunger you will feel can be controlled by better food choices and so on, but you will have to also get used to feeling some level of hunger.

We have been telling people for decades now to be worried that they might harm themselves by too much restriction and it is just wrong. What is harmful is being over weight. What is harmful is then confusing people that they are somehow going to lose weight without much restriction or being hungry.This also scales really bad with age because as you age the CNS recovery gets worse and worse compared to muscle recovery.At 55, there is simply no way for me to lose weight other than being hungry. It is impossible to recover from the amount of exercise that would be needed. The reality is that no one needs to worry about too much restriction until they are down to around 12% or so body fat. The fact a person's bodyfat % is never mentioned in this is exemplary of how bad the standard advise is.Most people have too much leptin and leptin resistance. Then those same people get the same bad advise over and over to not restrict too much because you don't want to be like an anorexic or extreme athlete and have too low of leptin. Of course, ignoring that the anorexic and extreme athlete are going to have incredibly low bodyfat percentages.

For example, I don't feel satisfied with my meal if I don't feel slightly full. So, what has worked for me is to generally have a single large meal per day, in which I will typically eat whatever I've been really craving since my last meal. In some days that might be steak and brocolli, in other days it might be a McDonald's meal, or some cake. When I get cravings, it's far easier for me to defer them to tomorrow's meal than it would be to just stop eating junk food entirely, or to eat half a burger and two fries from the bag. The exact opposite might be true for other people, and you won't really know until you've tried for yourself.One thing I will note - I think one of the concerns of the poster you are replying to with focusing too much on enduring hunger is that it might lead some people to develop anorexia, which is indeed a huge problem, even when the person is really overweight (since their anorexia will not just go away once they've lost that extra weight, it will keep going until they get dangerously malnourished).

Sure it's easier to fast but you're missing out on the other benefits associated with exercise.

This is very true, exercise is very important for health regardless of its effect on weight.> For cardio sure but for weight training you're burning calories and tearing muscle fibres to increase size/strength.True, but you need to spend even more time to rack up 800 Cal worth of exercise by weight training compared to doing cardio, as a beginner or even an intermediate level gym goer.It is also true though that weight training, if you actually successfully build muscle mass, can significantly increase your BMR and thus help with losing weight in that way, even if you're not spending hours or lifting hundreds of kilos at every session.

Right, and that's kind of my point - the ""2000 kcal"" figure is itself part of the problem. It's a rough global average that doesn't account for your sex, age, weight, body composition, activity level, or even climate. It's a number on a food label, not a physiological reality for any specific person.And even if you could nail down your actual total daily energy expenditure, calorie counting treats all calories as equal, which they aren't. Your body spends 20-30% of the energy in protein just to digest and metabolize it, compared to 5-10% for carbohydrates and 0-5% for fat. So 100 kcal of chicken breast and 100 kcal of butter are not metabolically equivalent - your body nets significantly less usable energy from the protein. This is the thermic effect of food, and it alone accounts for roughly 10% of your total daily energy expenditure.Speaking of which - basal metabolic rate (just keeping your organs running, blood circulating, cells maintained) accounts for about 60-70% of total daily energy expenditure. Add the thermic effect of food on top and you're at roughly 70-80% of your energy budget spent before you even stand up from bed [1]. Physical activity - including your 100km rides - typically makes up the remaining 20-30%, though obviously that range is wide and shifts dramatically for endurance athletes.So yes, of course people who cycle 100km need more fuel. Nobody is disputing that. My point is that most people vastly overestimate how many calories exercise burns relative to what their body spends just existing, and they use kcal as a universal unit of nutritional value when the body's actual energy extraction varies significantly by macronutrient composition. People optimizing purely on calorie numbers are working with a model that's far rougher than they think.And this whole picture gets worse with wearables pushing calorie counts front and center. You see it all the time - ""my wearable shows that i burned 300 kcal with that activity so it zero outs that sweet thing I ate earlier that was also 300 kcal"" That's wrong on multiple levels - the device estimate is inaccurate to begin with, the thermic processing of that pastry isn't equivalent to the ""300 kcal"" on its label, and your body doesn't do neat arithmetic like that anyway. But with every fitness app and smartwatch plastering a big kcal number on your workout summary, it's becoming the default way people think about food and exercise, and it's reinforcing exactly the wrong mental model.[1]: https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/basal-metabolic-r...

That specific aspect might end up irrelevant for dieting, which is exciting since it flies in the face of intuition. It seems that when it comes to long-term modes of existence (as opposed to, say, the one day of the marathon) the ""activity level"" doesn't really affect how much energy your body uses.>  In this study, we used the doubly-labeled water method to measure total daily energy expenditure (kCal/day) in Hadza hunter-gatherers to test whether foragers expend more energy each day than their Western counterparts. As expected, physical activity level, PAL, was greater among Hadza foragers than among Westerners. Nonetheless, average daily energy expenditure of traditional Hadza foragers was no different than that of Westerners after controlling for body size.https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal...

If you're exercising to lose weight, you're probably thinking that more exercise means more weight loss, which means that you could be overtraining.I recently got a second Apple Watch to wear to bed to track my sleep, and it's given me some really great insights into when I'm hitting the red zone and need to dial back training. For exercise, more intensity is not always better. What matters is consistency, not consistently high intensity.

No you dont. Exercise does help, and has many other benefits but is not the main driving factor for losing weight. Diet is by far the most important one. Calories intake vs expenditure is the only thing you need to worry about if your primary goal is weight loss.

This doesn't mean you aren't over training.If it's strength training... Without knowing the specifics what you are describing sounds like too much volume (and training for hypertrophy). Lower reps (3-5) & higher weight will have more of a strength stimulus and be less taxing.If it's cardio... you probably should be at a lower intensity and going for longer.

So for any creatine to make its way to the brain, your muscular creatine stores must be topped up first.I think dosage would depend on the amount of daily physical activity. If you work out a lot, you'd have to replenish your muscular creatine stores before the brain could access any/much.She also mentions boosting creatine dosage after bouts of mental exertion.

Most of the computation and learning that occurs is attributable to the relative timing of spiking events. A lot of information can be encoded in the delay between 2 spikes. The advantage of biology is that there is no explicit quantization of the time domain that must occur. Biology gets to do a lot of things ""for free"". Simulating causality in a computer in a similar way requires a priority queue and runs like ass by comparison.

Some of it is willpower and personality, but maybe some of it is a buildup of adenosine.This squares with my personal experience. It's harder to start things after day's worth of intense mental effort.

If you were on the fence about buying a shiny new console or waiting for the new hotness, you shouldn't hold out much hope for the future of gaming hardware. The price of RAM and SSD storage has become so untenable that current consoles could get more expensive while future devices will only get further delayed.

This is becoming clear across the board. AI data centers have sapped up RAM and NAND supply, so much so that even major tech giants can't easily source memory anymore. Over the weekend, Bloomberg reported, based on several anonymous sources close to Nintendo, that the company was currently “contemplating” raising the cost of its $450 Switch 2. Less than a year ago, Nintendo fans were complaining about how the Japanese game maker's latest handheld console cost $150 more than the original Switch.

See Switch 2 at Amazon

Japanese investors were already antsy about the skyrocketing price of DRAM (dynamic random access memory) and how that was impacting profits on Nintendo's latest hardware. Nintendo's share price has already taken hits over the last few months despite Switch 2 sales numbers remaining positive throughout the end of 2025. Analysts told IGN that the sequel Switch was still selling well despite slowing sales numbers compared to the handheld's June launch. Nintendo spiked the cost of the original Switch and Switch OLED in 2025 due to Trump's tariffs. It kept the Switch 2 price steady while it hiked costs on peripherals instead.

Valve's upcoming Steam Machine is also caught up in the morass of the ongoing RAM shortage. Valve delayed the PC/console hybrid and said it had to “revisit” its release date and price point. It doesn't seem like Valve has managed to source more RAM for its hardware, either.

The makers of Half-Life slapped its Steam Deck OLED listings with an “out of stock” sticker on its store page since last month. On Sunday, Valve published a note to the page reading, “Steam Deck OLED may be out of stock intermittently in some regions due to memory and storage shortages. The Steam Deck LCD 256GB is no longer in production, and once sold out will no longer be available.”

Before the RAM situation worsened, Valve had hinted its console could cost close to a PC of similar specs, which could have meant a price tag as high as $800. Valve would have to heavily subsidize its hardware to bring it anywhere close to affordable. Nintendo has to be far more price conscious than either Sony or Microsoft (especially with Xbox, which is in freefall). The company built its brand on its lower-end hardware that can outshine the competition thanks to exclusive first-party games from beloved franchises like Mario, Zelda, and Pokémon.

Gamers may have to buckle down with current hardware. Bloomberg also cited more anonymous sources when it claimed Sony could push the long-rumored PlayStation 6 launch all the way to 2028 and 2029. That may not be as big of a bummer as it sounds. Despite the PS5 and Xbox Series S/X having launched in 2020, they still have more to give thanks to additional software performance enhancements. The Switch 2 is proving itself graphically capable despite its lower-end GPU specs and minimal power draw. That's mostly thanks to Nvidia's DLSS (deep learning super sampling) upscaling. There are mounting rumors that suggest Sony could launch a PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) update that could drastically enhance performance—especially on PS5 Pro units.

The PlayStation 5 may be just over five years old, but it's far from nearing the end of its life. Sony is launching a monitor, fight stick, and—potentially even an enhanced remote/game streaming player to keep the PS5 hardware rolling. The Switch 2 now has more accessories, like the Virtual Boy recreation, available to start out 2026. The best option players have now is to stick with what they have and hope that when the AI bubble pops, it doesn't take the world economy with it.

With memory costs still sky-high, finding deals is key to maximizing bang for your buck. Newegg is leading the charge with multiple bundles that offer some combination of RAM, CPU, and motherboard, often throwing in some freebies on top of it (think games, or AIOs, or even an air duster). We're spotlighting a deal on a capable budget-class motherboard in the Gigabyte B850 Aorus Elite Wifi 7, along with 32GB of Corsair Vengeance RGB DDR5-6400 RAM for just under $505 (20%/$133.00 off), which makes the overall price more palatable.

We reviewed the B850 Aorus Elite Wifi 7 motherboard a while ago, and even at $230 (when it was released), it was a good overall value, showing solid all-around performance in our testing, a wide range of DIY-friendly features, three M.2 sockets, ample USB ports, and a budget-friendly price point. It supports 7000- and 9000-series AMD processors, including the recently released Ryzen 7 9850X3D, the fastest gaming processor on the market.

Get a solid deal on 32GB of Corsair DDR5-6400 CL36 RAM and the Gigabyte B850 Aorus Elite Wifi 7 motherboard for just $540 (21% / $133.00 off).

The board offers 12 total USB ports on the rear IO, though the fastest back here is a USB 3.2 Gen 2 (10 Gbps) Type-C port (there is a front panel 20 Gbps Type-C header). Three M.2 sockets hide under the DIY-friendly plate heatsink in the middle, with one running PCIe 5.0 x4 (128 Gbps). If you're carrying over SATA-based storage, the four ports should be enough. In addition to integrated Wi-Fi 7 (though not the fastest), the board also features 2.5 GbE for fast wired connectivity. The audio solution on the rev 1.0 is basic, but sufficient for most users. Memory support is listed to 256GB and speeds up to DDR5-8200, which is plenty fast for the platform and well past the 6000-6400 MT/s sweet spot.

Specifications and performance aside, the all-black motherboard will also look good inside your chassis of choice. There are even a few RGBs hidden under the chipset heatsink to add some glow. If black isn't your thing, Newegg is also offering the white version of the board with the same RAM for $529.99.

Included in the combo is Corsair Vengeance RGB 32GB (2x16GB) DDR5-6400 CL36 RAM, $439.99 if bought alone. The black kit has a frosted RGB light bar that runs the length of the sticks and is sure to draw attention inside your case. Or, if RGB lighting isn't your thing and you prefer a stealthy appearance, you can turn it off (on the motherboard, too). The decent DDR5-6400 speed lands in AMD's sweet spot and is a worthwhile and good-looking option for a 32GB kit. With the bundle deal, $139.99 off, you're essentially buying the RAM for a reasonable-for-the-times $300.

The 4-star Gigabyte motherboard, 32GB of Corsair RAM, and 20% discount makes this a solid two-item combo deal. If this deal isn't for you, we've found several others with RAM in our Best RAM combo deals 2026 that are worth checking out.

Edited by Javed Choudhury

Daily 10-mg dapagliflozin treatment for 12 months was associated with a significant reduction in liver fat in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), independent of weight loss or other metabolic changes, according to a secondary analysis of a clinical trial. 

“While others have hypothesized that the reduction in liver fat may be related to weight loss and glycemic control, our results suggest that liver fat reduction may be independent from weight loss and other well-described metabolic effects of SGLT2 [inhibitor],” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Anna V. Naumova and Guilherme Moura Cunha, both from the University of Washington, Seattle. It was published online in Obesity.

The small sample size and single-center design may have limited generalizability. The limited number of patients with moderate or severe steatosis prevented subgroup analysis by steatosis severity. The use of post-processed cardiac MRI data did not allow for complete liver sampling.

This study received financial support from AstraZeneca, Bayer, and other sources. The authors reported no conflicts of interest.

Nucleotide synthesis-the production of the basic components of DNA and RNA-is essential for cell growth and division. In most animal cells, this process depends closely on properly functioning mitochondria, the organelles responsible for respiration and energy production. When mitochondrial respiration fails-a common feature of mitochondrial diseases and several forms of cancer-cells lose the ability to proliferate normally. A new study published in Nature Metabolism now shows that this dependence is not irreversible.

An international team led by José Antonio Enríquez of the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III (CNIC) and the Spanish network for research into frailty and healthy aging (CIBERFES) has experimentally uncoupled nucleotide synthesis from mitochondrial activity using ScURA, a yeast-derived genetic tool now available to the research community that will enable new explorations of cellular metabolism.

The study, which also involved scientists at the University of Cologne (Germany), the University of Valladolid (UVa), and the CSIC–UVa Institute of Biology and Molecular Genetics, sheds new light on the role of mitochondria in rare diseases and cancer.

In complex organisms such as humans, respiration is essential for generating the energy required for life, with the mitochondria in our cells using oxygen to sustain vital cellular processes. By contrast, some organisms-such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae-can survive without oxygen and have evolved alternative metabolic pathways to produce the molecular building blocks required for RNA and DNA synthesis.

Building on this observation, the team identified a yeast enzyme that can sustain nucleotide synthesis independently of mitochondrial respiration. Instead of oxygen, this enzyme uses fumarate, a metabolite derived from nutrients. The team extracted the gene encoding this enzyme, called ScURA, from yeast and inserted it into human cells.

Unlike cells from healthy individuals, the patient-derived cells used in the study cannot grow in standard laboratory conditions because they require extra supplementation with nutrients and DNA precursors. When CNIC researchers introduced ScURA into these diseased cells, they found that the cells were able to grow under normal conditions, just like cells from healthy individuals. ""Thanks to the yeast gene, the cells 'learned' to build DNA in a new way,"" explain the authors.

The results were striking: human cells expressing ScURA continued to produce DNA and RNA even when the mitochondrial respiratory chain was blocked. Unlike the equivalent human enzyme, which is physically linked to the mitochondria, the yeast version works in the cytosol and uses an alternative metabolic pathway.

The team also discovered that ScURA helped cells use their nutrients more efficiently without disrupting other essential cellular functions-an important first step toward the more ambitious goal of improving the lives of people with mitochondrial disorders.

Mitochondria not only produce energy; they also shape fundamental processes such as DNA synthesis. Our work shows that if we provide a cell with an alternative route to make nucleotides, we can sustain cell proliferation even when mitochondrial respiration fails.""

José Antonio Enríquez, lead author, head of the CNIC GENOXPHOS group

One of the study's most important findings is that ScURA-modified cells can grow without uridine supplementation, a common strategy used in laboratories to compensate for mitochondrial defects.

Moreover, the new approach restores cell proliferation across different experimental models of mitochondrial diseases, including those caused by severe mutations in essential respiratory chain complexes. For first author Andrea Curtabbi (CNIC), ""this tool allows us, for the first time, to clearly separate the direct effects of mitochondrial dysfunction on nucleotide synthesis from other secondary metabolic changes.""

Mitochondrial diseases are severe and often untreatable, and in the laboratory cells with impaired mitochondrial respiration require external supplements to proliferate. However, when the researchers inserted ScURA into these cells, they proliferated under standard conditions in the same way as healthy cells.

The study also shows that this imported enzyme boosts the efficiency of nutrient use without altering other essential cellular functions, making ScURA a highly valuable experimental tool. The authors further highlight its potential for clarifying mitochondrial contributions to rare diseases and cancer. ""Identifying which metabolic processes become limiting when mitochondrial respiration fails is crucial for designing precise therapeutic strategies,"" concludes Enríquez.

In future work, the team plans to expand their findings to other disease models and optimize this approach for preclinical research.

The project was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (projects PID2021-127988OB-I00 and TED2021-131611B-100), the Human Frontier Science Program (RGP0016/2018), the Leducq Foundation (17CVD04), and the Instituto de Salud Carlos III–CIBERFES (CB16/10/00282).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study reveals how body image evolves for people learning to use robotic prosthetics","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260217/Study-reveals-how-body-image-evolves-for-people-learning-to-use-robotic-prosthetics.aspx","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 16:09:00 GMT","

The way we understand the movement of our own bodies plays an important role when learning physical skills, from sports to dancing. But a new study finds this phenomenon works very differently for people learning to use robotic prosthetic devices.

""When people first start walking with a prosthetic leg, they think their bodies are moving more awkwardly than they really are,"" says Helen Huang, corresponding author of a paper on the work. ""With practice, as their performance improves, people still do a poor job of assessing how their bodies move, but they are inaccurate in a very different way.

""This is the first study to look at this phenomenon in people using lower-limb robotic prosthetics, and it raises a number of questions that should help us improve people's ability to walk with these devices,"" says Huang, who is the Jackson Family Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering in the Lampe Joint Department of Biomedical Engineering at North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Everyone has a personal body image – an understanding of how their body is structured, how it moves, and so on. And this understanding of our bodies informs the way we move. When learning a new physical skill, such as dancing, we have a mental image of how our bodies are moving – but that's often not the way our bodies are actually moving. Over time our mental image of how our body moves more closely aligns with our actual movements, and our physical performance improves.

We wanted to learn more about how and whether people who are using robotic prosthetics incorporate that prosthetic device into their body image. Does that change as people become more familiar with using these devices? Is there any relationship between incorporating these devices into one's body image and their performance using these devices?""

Helen Huang, corresponding author

For this study, the researchers recruited nine able-bodied study participants. Over the course of four days, study participants were tasked with walking using a robotic prosthetic attached to a knee bent at a right angle. Specifically, they were asked to walk on a treadmill as quickly as possible without touching handrails.

Participants practiced using the prosthetic device each day. After each practice, participants were shown a computer animation that displayed a range of different biomechanical walking gaits, and were asked to select which gait was closest to their recent performance using the prosthesis.

""Initially, participants felt their gait was more off-balance and stilted than it actually was,"" Huang says. ""By the end of the four-day study, participants felt their gait was more fluid and natural than it actually was. The performance of all participants did improve significantly over those four days. However, the participants were all still inaccurate at assessing the way their own bodies moved – just in a more confident way.""

The researchers found that one of the things study participants were focused on when assessing their own gait was the position of their torso. The participants did not place much emphasis on the behavior of the prosthetic device itself.

""One reason for this is likely because they are receiving very little direct feedback about the behavior of the device – they can't see themselves moving,"" Huang says. ""This raises the possibility of improving performance by giving people visual or other feedback they can use to calibrate their body image and gait while training with the prosthetic device.

""It will also be important to address the overconfidence people have in their own movement skills,"" Huang says. ""If you already think you're doing great, you're less likely to put in the work necessary to get better – even if there is significant room for improvement. We think it would be valuable to find a way to give people a more accurate assessment of how their body is really moving.""

The paper, ""Projecting the New Body: How Body Image Evolves During Learning to Walk with a Wearable Robot,"" will be published February 17 in the open access journal PNAS Nexus. First author of the paper is I-Chieh Lee, a former research assistant professor in the Lampe Joint Department. The paper was co-authored by Huan Min, a Ph.D. student at NC State, and by Ming Liu, a research associate professor in the Lampe Joint Department.

This work was done with support from the National Institutes of Health under grant R01HD110519; and from the National Science Foundation under grant 2211739.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Musicians experience higher rates of tinnitus, hearing loss, and hyperacusis than non-musicians","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260217/Musicians-experience-higher-rates-of-tinnitus-hearing-loss-and-hyperacusis-than-non-musicians.aspx","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 18:21:00 GMT","

A new systematic review and meta-analysis published in Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery, the official journal of the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF), reveals that musicians face substantially higher rates of tinnitus, hearing loss, and hyperacusis compared to non-musicians. The study, which pooled data from 67 studies encompassing more than 28,000 musicians across 21 countries.

The research found that 42.6% of musicians reported tinnitus (ringing in the ears), compared to just 13.2% in control populations. Hearing loss affected 25.7% of musicians versus 11.6% of controls, and hyperacusis - an increased sensitivity to everyday sounds - was reported by 37.3% of musicians compared to 15.3% of non-musicians.

Many musicians quietly live with ringing ears, sound sensitivity, or hearing loss, no matter whether they play in a symphony hall or a small club. Yet the research we have is still imperfect, often based on self-reported symptoms and missing details about things like other loud hobbies, specific instruments, and how consistently people use hearing protection. What we really need now is more personal, musician-entered risk profiling so we can offer practical, tailored advice that helps artists protect their hearing without sacrificing the music they love.""

Shaun A. Nguyen, MD, Professor, Department of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery, Medical University of South Carolina

Among musicians who experienced tinnitus, the majority (76.3%) described their symptoms as occasional, while 15.6% reported permanent tinnitus. Among musicians with hearing loss, approximately 63% of cases were based on subjective self-report, with only about 37% confirmed through objective audiometric testing - suggesting the true prevalence may be even higher than reported.

Notably, the study found no significant difference in the prevalence of hearing loss, hyperacusis, or tinnitus between classical and pop/rock musicians. This challenges previous assumptions and suggests that auditory risk extends across musical genres. The authors note that individual factors such as instrument type, seating position within an ensemble, room acoustics, and attitudes toward hearing protection may play a more critical role in auditory risk than genre alone.

The Jackson Laboratory–New York Stem Cell Foundation Collaborative (JAX-NYSCF) today announced a five-year strategic research collaboration with GSK focused on advancing human cellular models of neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer's disease.

The collaboration reflects a strategic focus that brings together human stem cell research, advanced data science tools, and large-scale research systems to help close a long-standing gap between scientific discovery and the development of new medicines. The goal is to generate disease-relevant cellular models that enable the scientific community to interrogate the underlying human biology of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and accelerate the translation of those insights into potential therapies.

""This collaboration is a concrete example of where early stage biomedical research is heading,"" said Lon Cardon, president and CEO of JAX, which recently expanded its discovery platform with the acquisition of NYSCF. ""Now we have the opportunity to extend those discoveries -and accelerate therapies to patients-by bridging traditional disease models with next-generation patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models that more accurately capture the complexity of human biology at scale.""

By integrating GSK's deep knowledge of neurodegeneration, translational science and drug discovery with JAX-NYSCF's pioneering stem cell technology and expertise, access to relevant patient cohorts, and automation platform, the partners aim to build more predictive models of neurodegenerative diseases for identifying and prioritizing promising drug candidates.

Establishing a translational biology and scientific discovery collaboration with JAX-NYSCF complements the work we are doing at GSK on cellular models of disease, and offers the potential to yield new insights that may help accelerate therapeutic discovery for devastating neurodegenerative diseases, building on our established expertise in immunology and inflammation. By working together with JAX-NYSCF, we have an opportunity to develop more predictive models and ultimately, to use that better understanding to develop potential new medicines and determine which patients are most likely to benefit from new therapies.""

I cannot stop watching Elana Meyers Taylor's epic gold medal-winning monobob run from yesterday. Make sure you have a box of tissues, and never give up.

Now, back to soccer. In today's Full Time:

📃 New rules, she got them
🥲 Savy King's return
💃 “Sexy Dexy” strikes again

But first, the breaking news …

USWNT roster, by the numbers

The U.S. women's national team is less than two weeks away from its first tournament of 2026.

Moments ago, Emma Hayes named her 26-player roster for the 11th annual SheBelieves Cup, which will kick off on March 1 in Nashville. We'll get into the specifics of the tournament shortly, but first, let's talk about who's on the squad:



To start, every player has appeared for the U.S. at least one time. That seems like an odd thing to point out. However, that hasn't happened on a USWNT roster since last year's edition of this tournament. Maybe we are finally getting to that core Hayes keeps talking about. Still, this will be nine players' first SheBelieves Cup. More numbers:

U.S. Soccer also shared this brutally worded fun fact about the 32-year-old Sonnett, who has won a record seven SheBelieves Cups:

“Sonnett is the oldest player on the roster while (Lily) Yohannes is the youngest. Yohannes was eight years old and still living in the United States (she was two years away from her family's move to the Netherlands) when Sonnett earned her first cap in 2015.”

Why not toss in the No. 1 song and movie of the year so we all collectively feel the back pain creep in? (“Uptown Funk” by Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars and “Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens.”)

It's worth noting the USWNT's 2025 leading goal scorer, Catarina Macario, isn't on this list. The forward has played nine WSL games for Chelsea and featured in three Champions League games, but was left off Chelsea's squad list for the tournament later this month and next. While the 26-year-old has been recovering from injury, she has also recently been linked to an NWSL move — specifically to the San Diego Wave, according to ESPN.

Even with the “Triple Espresso” front three aiming for a 2026 comeback, this team is better when Macario is on the field.

New rules and how to watch

The U.S. will face Canada, Colombia and Argentina across Nashville, Columbus, Ohio, and Harrison, N.J., in a round-robin tournament from March 1-7. All games will be broadcast on TNT/TBS, truTV and HBO Max in English and in Spanish on Telemundo, Universo and Peacock.

Last week, SheBelieves Cup also introduced two new rules:

There will be no repeat title, as Japan will be participating in the Asian Cup in Australia and cannot defend its 2025 win. Before Japan took the title last year, the U.S. had a five-year win streak.

This is a prime opportunity for the U.S. to return its name to the trophy.

Shocking shuffle of USWNT players

The Kansas City Current are in America's Heartland, but last week, they were also at the heart of two major NWSL trades.

Claire Hutton, 23, went to Bay FC in a $1.1 million transaction. After evolving into one of KC's key contributors in the midfield, she is a crucial signing for Bay as they aim to bounce back from 2025, when they finished second-to-last in the NWSL.

The Current turned around and signed 2024 NWSL Rookie of the Year Croix Bethune from the Washington Spirit in a $1 million transfer deal. It was a shocking exit for the 24-year-old midfielder after two successful seasons with the Spirit. Bethune, one of the most creative midfielders in the league, brings a new flair to the Current's already impressive depth as they push for their first NWSL Championship.

Savy King returns after heart surgery

Angel City defender Savy King returned to soccer for the first time in 283 days on Sunday.

The 21-year-old started and played 30 minutes in Angel City's 2-1 preseason friendly loss to the Portland Thorns at the Coachella Valley Invitational in Indio, Calif. “I've been looking forward to this for the last nine months,” King said. She called the moment the “best feeling in the world.”

A quick refresher:

And now King is back on the field, but not before a moment with Jennifer Hudson on her eponymous talk show. Watch for a sweet surprise from King's Angel City teammates.

🖤 Black History Month

Did you remember this record breaker?

It's time for our Black History Month trivia. We are testing your knowledge of some iconic women who've made a mark on the sport. Last week, we asked: Who holds the record for most NWSL goals across all competitions?

USWNT forward Lynn Biyendolo broke that record on May 19, 2024, when she scored her 79th career goal across all competitions. At the time, she was starting for Gotham FC, her fourth NWSL club, and scored a headed goal against the Chicago Stars. Ironically, former Chicago forward Sam Kerr held the previous record for nearly seven years.

Biyendolo went on to make the 2024 Olympic squad that won gold and was traded to the Seattle Reign later that year. In October 2025, Biyendolo announced she was pregnant with her first child, but not before reaching 82 goals across all competitions.

Also, I would like to give a special shoutout to last week's winner, the NWSL, who clearly read this newsletter last Monday and shared the correct answer shortly after.

This week's question: In 1999, the USWNT went to penalty kicks with China in the World Cup final. Before Brandi Chastain converted her famous final shot, goalkeeper Briana Scurry made a crucial save. Which kicker did she make the save on? (Answer to come in the next newsletter.)

First Looks

Chelsea in crisis: Following Chelsea's 2-0 win over Liverpool on Sunday, head coach Sonia Bompastor admitted the week had been “tough,” referencing the club's decision to part ways with former head of women's football Paul Green. To understand just how crucial he was to the seven-time WSL champions' success, read these words directly from one of the players he recruited.

Olympics update: Checking in on Sammy Smith, the skiing Stanford soccer player we introduced to you last week. She finally made her Olympic debut last week. The 20-year-old made it to the quarterfinals of the cross-country sprint classic event before bowing out. She could still possibly compete again in Italy. Even if that was her only race, it's more than enough to hang her hat (goggles?) on.

Working hard: Ever wonder what the hardest coaching job in the world is? We did, too.

First look: Boston Legacy released their primary kit for their inaugural season in the NWSL last week (stay tuned for more new kits later this month). Melanie Anzidei got a first look at the new uniforms ahead of their March 14 opener at Gillette Stadium.And finally: A special Valentine's Day moment for two top athletes. A month after Trinity Rodman convinced Hayes to do the “Sexy Dexy” dance, made popular by Giants defensive lineman Dexter Lawrence, she struck again. Rodman popped up at boyfriend Ben Shelton's Dallas Open semifinal match Saturday and brought the “Sexy Dexy” with her.

The city of Charlotte isn't hosting a match in the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

But the Queen City will still be involved in the festivities.

Charlotte FC announced on Tuesday that the Scotland National Team will set up shop in Atrium Health Performance Park — the practice facility of the city's MLS club — for the duration of the World Cup, which will begin June 11 and run until mid-July.

The 52,000-square-foot facility in East Charlotte opened in October 2023 and includes locker rooms, a cafeteria, a large weight room, fields and offices utilized by Charlotte FC's business staff. Scotland will use all of these amenities as its headquarters ahead of the team's Group C matches against Haiti, Morocco and Brazil.

“We're excited to welcome Scotland, one of the world's most historic football associations, to Charlotte for the FIFA World Cup,” Tepper Sports and Entertainment CEO Kristi Coleman wrote in a statement. “This summer bring the biggest sporting event North America has seen this century, and we're honored for Charlotte FC to be named a team base camp for a major European nation.”

Scotland is making its return to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.

Charlotte now joins two other North Carolina cities that will be hosting national teams during the World Cup. Germany will set up its base training site in Winston-Salem, and Norway will be in Greensboro.

Scotland head coach Steve Clarke told UK media outlets last week that “we have secured Charlotte as a base for the team.” That news became official Tuesday, and Clarke expanded on why Charlotte FC's place fit what he was looking for.

“We are delighted to confirm Charlotte as our training base,” Clarke stated via a release. “We looked at the FIFA-nominated options, against our own predetermined criteria, and Charlotte FC (has) a top MLS training facility with everything we need to prepare for our matches.

“I'd like to add that Charlotte FC's staff could not have been more welcoming. As most competing nations have discovered, travel will be an important factor in this World Cup. Our base in Charlotte will be convenient for the airport, with flights around two hours to Boston and Miami for our group stage matches. We are hopeful that this will give us the best possible conditions to get ready for the tournament, and it's another exciting landmark ahead of the summer.”

In the group stage, Scotland will play two matches at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, and one match at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.

The Scottish FA and Charlotte FC have a few prominent connections. Among them:

This will mark the second consecutive summer Charlotte FC's facilities will be utilized by a team playing in a global FIFA competition. Bank of America Stadium was the site of four FIFA Club World Cup matches last summer.

Even though Charlotte won't officially host any matches in this summer's World Cup, it will be the site of a “send-off” friendly ahead of the tournament, pitting the U.S. Men's National Team against Senegal on May 31.

It's reported FIFA is unsure as to why there is a lack of hype for the 2026 World Cup - but the internet thinks it's figured it out and it's really not that surprising.

Touchline reports ""many seats remain unsold"" for a number of games across the tournament and says FIFA bosses are scratching their heads as to why.

It's the first FIFA World Cup with 48 teams and will take place across the US, Canada and Mexico.

But in the comments on Touchline's X / Twitter post, the internet seems to have worked out why there isn't the biggest amount of hype for it so far.

The top comment posted a comparison of ticket prices from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar to the 2026 open and the difference is astronomical. 

A second agreed: ""Have they seen the ticket prices? They expect people to buy that? If they really care about this sport they will have to adjust on that part. They price are ridiculous.""

A third commented: ""FYI - I looked up ticket prices and for the individual dollar amount, the cost is WAY out of reach of anyone unless you're seriously wealthy. We're talking $1,500 or 3K or 4K per PERSON. How is that a family event? That's just the ticket price without flight and hotel.""

A fourth posted a similar price comparison.

A fifth added: ""With that amount per ticket?? I back out, there's nothing wrong with my TV, I will watch from home 🏠""

""The pricing has put the real football fans off,"" said a sixth. ""Imagine being so out of touch with economic realities of the world. Only tourist tickets and not the real football fans down the street.""

Away from ticket prices, one said: ""That's what you get when you take the World Cup to a country that calls it soccer.""

And another agreed.

Jadon Sancho and his rap star girlfriend Saweetie have made their first public appearance together. The Manchester United-owned winger, who is taking in a loan spell at Aston Villa, has been romantically linked to the American musician for some time. Their relationship has remained under wraps, but they have now stepped out holding hands during a trip to France.

England international Sancho was snapped enjoying an evening out with Saweetie - whose real name is Diamonte Quiava Valentin Harper - when heading for dinner in the French capital of Paris.

They were clearly in the city of love for a post-Valentine's Day break, having been caught on camera in Paris on Sunday. Sancho was unable to whisk his partner away on February 14 as he was in FA Cup action for Villa that day against Newcastle - as he stepped off the bench in a 3-1 defeat for Unai Emery's side.

Sancho and Saweetie dressed up for their night on the tiles, although they also wrapped up against the elements as winter chills continue to bite in Europe. The pair were in high spirits as they smiled for the cameras that caught them leaving their hotel for some food and drink.

The following day, they were spotted again - in more casual attire - when visiting the iconic Shakespeare and Company bookstore. Their loved-up display continued as they once again held hands while entering the venue.

Sancho, who appears destined to miss out on a place in England's World Cup squad this summer after struggling for consistent form at club level, was first rumoured to be dating Saweetie in 2025.

While celebrating Chelsea's Conference League final triumph - during a loan spell with the Blues - the 32-year-old rapper was spotted as the lock screen on Sancho's phone. Speculation raged from that point.

Sancho further fuelled those rumours when getting a tattoo featuring his new girlfriend's name. He was seen at the California-based Apollo Tattoo and Piercing Studio. They shared an image on their Instagram account of the 25-year-old forward getting the word Qiava - Saweetie's middle name - inked onto his neck, behind his left ear.

While finding comfort and stability away from the pitch, Sancho is facing an uncertain future in his day job. His contract at Manchester United is due to expire in the summer, which will drop him into the free agency pool.

A testing time has been endured at Old Trafford since completing a £75 million ($102m) transfer from Borussia Dortmund in 2021. He registered just 12 goals through 83 appearances for United, leading to him tumbling down the attacking pecking order.

Regular starts have proved hard to come by at Villa, with the target only being found on one occasion for them, but Emery has not closed the door on a permanent deal being offered to the tricky winger.

Villa's head coach said recently when asked if an extended stay in the West Midlands for Sancho has been discussed: “Not yet, but he is a fantastic player. Hopefully he can help us by increasing his qualities in our structure like he is doing.

“He will need another contract, and maybe it could be here. If he plays his best football, we will want him. But also other teams could be involved in the interest for him.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","'The rules are different!'","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/raphinha-barcelona-referee-conspiracy-girona-controversy-hansi-flick-la-liga-title-race/bltf213e22fef5f6b6f","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 16:00:30 GMT","

The fallout from Barcelona's shock 2-1 defeat to Girona has taken a dramatic turn following a night of officiating chaos at the Estadi Montilivi. While Hansi Flick's side surrendered a crucial lead and slipped behind Real Madrid in the Liga title race, the post-match narrative has been dominated by a controversial winning goal from Fran Beltran. The Blaugrana are now fuming over what they perceive as a systemic bias, leading to an explosive ""against everyone"" rallying cry from within the dressing room.

The Catalan derby was billed as a pivotal moment in the title race, but it ended in scenes of pure exasperation for the visitors. Barcelona appeared to be in control after Pau Cubarsi opened the scoring, yet the game flipped on its head during a frantic second half. The breaking point arrived in the 86th minute when Fran Beltran found the net for Girona. Barcelona players immediately surrounded referee Cesar Soto Grado, claiming that Claudio Echeverri had stepped on Jules Kounde's foot in the build-up.

Despite the frantic protests and the clear impact on the play, the goal was allowed to stand without a trip to the VAR monitor. The decision left the Barcelona bench incensed and the players visibly demoralised. For a team that has been near-perfect under Flick this season, the collapse felt less like a tactical failure and more like a consequence of external factors, setting the stage for a week of intense scrutiny over the standard of refereeing in the Spanish top flight.

In the immediate aftermath, manager Hansi Flick attempted to maintain a level of professional decorum, though he could not hide his disbelief. While he criticised his team's defensive positioning and ""open"" midfield, he pointedly asked reporters: ""What do you think? A foul, right? No need to say anything more."" Flick granted his squad two days off to ""reset"" from the emotional toll of the defeat, hoping to prevent the controversy from derailing their season entirely.

However, Brazilian winger Raphinha was far less reserved than his manager. Taking to Instagram to address the officiating landscape, the former Leeds United man acknowledged internal flaws but hit out at the lack of consistency. ""Well, we have many things to improve, but not just us,"" he wrote. ""It's very complicated when the rules are different, whether they're in your favour or against you, but if we have to play against everyone to win, so be it… We'll do it..""

The anger emanating from the dressing room has been matched by a firm response from the club's boardroom. Barcelona's leadership has reportedly reached a 'boiling point' regarding a perceived lack of transparency from the Technical Committee of Referees (CTA). Rafa Yuste, who has stepped up from his vice-president role to take full control of the club while the election campaign is running, has already made contact with Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) officials to express the club's formal grievance over the accumulation of errors that have directly impacted recent results.

The club is particularly concerned with the 'black and white' application of VAR in certain matches compared to the subjective leniency shown in others. By adopting this institutional pushback, Barcelona are signalling that they will no longer remain silent while their title ambitions are being undermined. This 'siege mentality' is beginning to define the second half of their campaign, as the board seeks to protect the players from what they describe as an uneven playing field.""

The controversy at Girona did not happen in a vacuum; it is the latest chapter in a mounting list of complaints for the Blaugrana. Just days earlier, the club were left stunned during a 4-0 Copa del Rey defeat to Atletico Madrid, where a Cubarsi goal was chalked off following a VAR review that lasted an agonising seven minutes. That delay, coupled with an unpunished encroachment by Bryan Gil during a Lamine Yamal penalty miss against Girona, has fostered a belief that officiating standards are at an all-time low.

As they prepare to host Levante this Sunday, the pressure on the officials will be immense. Barcelona now find themselves in a position where every whistle is viewed through the lens of Raphinha's 'different rules' claim. Whether this bunker mentality will serve as the fuel for a historic title charge or become a fatal distraction remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the war of words between Barcelona and the Spanish officiating bodies is only just beginning.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

 Bahrain Test 1: What we learned day 3 

Formula 1 will continue to race at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya until at least 2032.

F1 has announced a multi-year extension with the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya to host a Grand Prix in 2028, 2030, and 2032 in addition to the event scheduled in 2026. From this year the race will also be re-named as the Barcelona-Catalunya Grand Prix.

The extension follows significant investment at the circuit in recent years including the construction of the Circuit Rooftop, a new hospitality space overlooking turns 9, 10, and 11 and the entrance of the main straight, as well as the installation of solar panels throughout the circuit.

Built in 1991 as part of the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games development programme, the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya features an exciting mix of high and low speed corners and has played host to many memorable moments, including Max Verstappen's maiden Grand Prix victory in 2016.

In 2025, 300,000 fans attended the race weekend, which saw Oscar Piastri claim victory with team mate Lando Norris in second. From the current grid, Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso have also crossed the line first in Barcelona.

In recent years, organisers have taken steps to elevate the overall fan experience and ensure that the wider community is at the heart of the Grand Prix. For the last two years there has been a fan festival hosted in the iconic Plaça de Catalunya ahead of the Grand Prix weekend, which will return in 2026.

The races in Barcelona will be in rotation with the Grand Prix at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, which will take place in 2026, 2027, 2029, and 2031.

“Barcelona is an incredible city, and the Formula 1 fans there always welcome us with such passion, so I am delighted that we will continue to race at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya for years to come.” said Stefano Domenicali, President & CEO of Formula 1.

""The team have invested heavily in the circuit and hosted fantastic fan festivals in recent years, so we look forward to seeing how they continue to develop the experience, both for attendees at the race and for the city as a whole.

""I would like to thank Salvador Illa, President of the Government of Catalunya, Pol Gibert, CEO of Circuits de Catalunya SL and General Secretary of the Department of Business and Employment for their unwavering commitment to hosting Formula 1, and Oriol Sagrera, the former CEO of Circuits de Catalunya SL and former General Secretary of the Department of Business and Employment, who was key to securing the renewal. I can't wait to see our brilliant fans in Barcelona in June!”

Pol Gibert, CEO of Circuits de Catalunya SL and General Secretary of the Department of Business and Employment, said: “We welcome the renewal of the Formula 1 Grand Prix in Catalonia, at least until 2032.

""We would like to express our gratitude to Formula 1 for the trust placed in the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya and in the region over all these years. This renewal is the result of a strong relationship and close collaboration and represents a very important step in further consolidating Catalonia as a key fixture on the international calendar.

""Formula 1 generates an economic impact of more than €300 million per edition, but above all it is a strategic event that helps project Catalonia worldwide as a country capable of hosting top-level sporting competitions.”

The actor had been on an extended weekend bar crawl since Thursday.

Deputy Editor, East Coast


Shia LaBeouf‘s Mardi Gras bar crawl has come to an unfortunate end.


	The actor was arrested shortly after midnight Tuesday in New Orleans after he allegedly fought with two men, who told police he assaulted them.




	According to the New Orleans Police Department, LaBeouf was allegedly causing a disturbance and becoming increasingly aggressive at a business, which TMZ reported was a bar, on Royal Street.


The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed that the incident took place at R Bar in the Faubourg Marigny, where on Monday evenings you can get a haircut and a shot for $20.

	A staff member attempted to eject LaBeouf from R Bar, but after he was removed from the building, LaBeouf allegedly hit one man several times with closed fists.


	He then, according to the police report, left but came back, allegedly acting more aggressive.


	After multiple people attempted to hold him down, LaBeouf was let up, the police report states, “in hopes that he would leave,” but he then allegedly resumed hitting the same man who he allegedly punched earlier.


	He then allegedly punched another person in the nose and was held down until the police arrived.


	LaBeouf was taken to a hospital for unknown injuries and then arrested and charged with two counts of simple battery.


	The arrest comes after LaBeouf, who recently claimed to be sober and blamed past abusive behavior on alcoholism, went on an extended-weekend bar crawl during Mardi Gras in New Orleans' Uptown neighborhood, according to employees of various drinking establishments.


	He showed up at 24/7 bar Ms Mae's, around the time the Bacchus super-krewe parade rolled up St. Charles Avenue with thousands of revelers, in what the establishment's doorman said was an “inebriated” state and “somewhat belligerent.” He was also without cash or a shirt, putting the latter back on when he was told he had to. He had visited the same establishment on Thursday. But on Sunday, the doorman said, “He did the ‘Do you know who I am?' bit” and begrudingly left without incident after he attempted to “be a celebrity bartender” and was asked to leave.

	











	Another bartender, who waited on him last Thursday, said, “He is terrorizing the city!” He was spotted at at least two other bars in the city and was telling people he was staying at a luxury Airbnb.


Feb. 17, 10:32 a.m. This story has been updated with the bar where this incident took place.

Mister “follows a man (Goggins) who wakes up in a strange house covered in blood and comes to realize his true identity while fighting off contract killers from his past — including everyone from his exes to his best friend. To get out, he teams up with his estranged daughter (Moretz) who also has ended up in the family business, but they will need to repair their relationship in order to survive”. Additional casting is in process.


	Basil Iwanyk and Erica Lee produce for Thunder Road alongside Goggins. Nicki Cortese, who also penned the script with Nick Inglis, will produce with Wayne Marc Godfrey for Bright White Light (Runner), which also is financing the film.


	Executive producers include Chase Vergari, Ibrahim Mohammed, Eric Handler, Will Flynn, and Sophie Meyer who will oversee for Bright White Light. Black Bear represents international rights on the film, with CAA Media Finance handling domestic. 


	The A-list crew includes DoP Henry Braham (Superman) and production designer Nigel Phelps (Thor: Love And Thunder).


Justified and The Hateful Eight star Goggins was recently Emmy and Golden Globe nominated for his performance in The White Lotus. He is due to start filming the third season of hit Amazon show Fallout later this year. 


Kick-Ass and The Equalizer star Moretz will next be seen in rom-com Love Language, and thriller The Edge Of Normal, the first English-language feature from director Carlota Pereda (Piggy). She recently returned to the stage in the off-Broadway play Caroline.

	











	Producer Basil Iwanyk told Deadline: “Walton and Chloë are the perfect pairing to capture Mister's heart and humor — while delivering some of the most ambitious and wildly entertaining action sequences audiences will see on screen this year.”


	Director Wade Eastwood told us: “From our first conversations, I knew Walton would bring an unpredictable spark you simply can't manufacture — he's electric. Chloë brings an incredible mix of strength, vulnerability and razor-sharp timing. Together, they make Mister exactly what we set out to create: bold, funny and completely full-throttle.”


	Goggins is repped by CAA and Darris Hatch Management. Moretz is represented by CAA and Sloane, Offer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Colbert says CBS preemptively pulled senate candidate interview after FCC pressure","https://www.avclub.com/colbert-james-talarico-fcc-cbs","Tue, 17 Feb 2026 14:23:38 GMT","

Last week, the FCC reportedly began following through on their threats to start poking around at The View after the talk show hosted Texas senatorial candidate James Talarico. Apparently CBS, despite their thirst for scoops, wanted desperately to avoid the same potential smoke. “You know who's not here tonight? That's Texas state rep James Talarico,” Stephen Colbert said on The Late Show last night. “He was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers directly that we could not have him on the broadcast. Then, I was told, in some uncertain terms, that not only could I not have him on, I couldn't mention me not having him on. And, because my network clearly doesn't want us to talk about this, let's talk about this.”

Talking about that good ol' equal time rule, Colbert joked, “It's the FCC's most time honored rule, after no nipples at the Super Bowl.” He went on, “Let's just call this what it is: Donald Trump's administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV, because all Trump does is watch TV, okay? He's like a toddler with too much screen time; he gets cranky and drops a load in his diaper. So, it's no surprise that two of the people most affected by this threat are me and my friend Jimmy Kimmel.” Since FCC head Brendan Carr had previously said they should conduct these interviews elsewhere, Colbert said that he'd be posting the interview with Talarico on The Late Show‘s YouTube page, which he did do. “The network says I can't give you a URL or a QR code, but I promise you, you go to our YouTube page, you'll find it.” (You can also find it here.) 

As Colbert goes on to point out, Carr's jurisdiction is not just broadcast TV but radio, but has declined to enforce any equal time rules that might apply to the vast ecosystem of right-wing talk radio. “I get this part, it makes sense. You can't get rid of talk radio. What else would your angriest uncle do in traffic? Talk to your saddest aunt?” Colbert quipped. In any case, the exception for late night talk shows hasn't been done away with yet. “But my network is unilaterally enforcing it as if he had. But ladies and gentlemen, I want to assure you, that this decision is for purely financial reasons.” You can watch the whole segment below.

Civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson has died at the age of 84, according to a report from BBC News. The outlet included a statement from his family confirming the death and paying tribute to the pivotal figure in U.S. history, revealing Jackson “died peacefully on Tuesday morning.” 

No official cause of death has been revealed as of the time of writing.

Jackson is probably best known for his pioneering work alongside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as a leader within the civil rights movement within the United States. 

In his life, he also ran for president of the United States twice during his life as a candidate for the Democratic Party in 1984 and 1988.

A statement released to BBC News confirms that Jackson “died peacefully on Tuesday morning, surrounded by his family.” 

The statement continues, “His unwavering commitment to justice, equality, and human rights helped shape a global movement for freedom and dignity. A tireless change agent, he elevated the voices of the voiceless from his presidential campaigns in the 1980s to mobilizing millions to register to vote — leaving an indelible mark on history.”

“Reverend Jackson is survived by his wife, Jacqueline; their children – Santita, Jesse Jr., Jonathan, Yusef, Jacqueline; daughter Ashley Jackson, and grandchildren.”

It concluded, “Our father was a servant leader – not only to our family, but to the oppressed, the voiceless, and the overlooked around the world. We shared him with the world, and in return, the world became part of our extended family. His unwavering belief in justice, equality, and love uplifted millions, and we ask you to honour his memory by continuing the fight for the values he lived by.”

Jackson had faced a number of health issues in recent years. In 2017, he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Meanwhile,  was hospitalised for observation in November 2025, with doctors confirming he had been diagnosed with a degenerative condition known as progressive supranuclear palsy.

American-British playwright Bonnie Greer told BBC News that Jackson was a “great” man and acted as a “big brother to my generation.”

She continued, “He was a man who was able to see the big picture, he was able to see the little picture, he was able to put them together to make the idea of America and the world into what he saw – a world where people can not only be equal, they can get better at being equal.”

From Michelangelo Antonioni's “L'avventura” to even Angelina Jolie's “By the Sea,” movies in which couples in crisis wander new terrain while also feeling like tourists in their own lives, welcome “Midwinter Break” to the club. In fact, in terms of the overall lugubriousness of Stella (Lesley Manville) and Gerry's (Ciarán Hinds) impromptu vacation to the sheer dour vibes of the chilly, gray Amsterdam weather, director Polly Findlay's new film seems to say, “Hold my Guinness.”

Though Manville and Hinds are incapable of performances that are anything less than fantastic, “Midwinter Break” serves up just about the most depressing holiday imaginable — and in a moviegoing season in which we are all already reeling from the most depressing winter ever. As for this “Midwinter Break”? More like “The Winter of Our Lives.” The script here is too stiffly restrained to a fault to make much of an emotional impact, even as spending time with these actors historically is never without pleasures.

Stella and Gerry are a long-ago empty-nested couple living in County Derry in a cozy village one would describe as being “nestled” in a nook somewhere in Ireland. Their lives, it appears, have sunken to the nadir of mundanity in retirement, with Gerry deep in his cups, boozing with a grim resolve, and Stella also not not about to bring out the wine a little too early in the day. She's also a piously devout Catholic who has given the biggest slice of her personality pie over to God; at a certain point, you are all but expecting her to pull out a whip and start repenting. 

 










It all has something to do with a vaguely foreshadowed accident she was involved in in Troubles-era Belfast several decades ago, while heavily pregnant — a cold infusion of snippets of which are administered like an IV drip throughout the movie. The type of memory flashbacks that are shot at knee level, gauzy and out of focus, with a gossamer visual touch to conjure whispering, buried emotions of the past.

Gerry, meanwhile, is about as patriotically Irish as Stella is Catholic — not just in the sense of his hard-drinking, but also with former glories of youth he's keen to share with any unsuspecting bartender who is forced to listen. He's the type of alcoholic who will take a sizable swig off a bottle in the few seconds here and there where his wife is in the next room. Stella knows she's codependent and complicit — and thus, to break the spell of another lonely Christmas (their son has opted only to phone in for the holiday) followed by another cold, lonely New Year's, Stella surprises Gerry with tickets to Amsterdam. Obviously, it's been some time since they've experienced anything adjacent to an adventure. He's instantly buoyed by the proposal, which at least eliminates “Midwinter Break” from being a movie where he's dragged abroad against his will.

Despite Gerry managing to score a bottle of whiskey somewhere, offscreen, in customs, his joie de vivre is not immediately refreshed upon arrival in Amsterdam, and neither is Stella's. It soon becomes clear that Stella may have brought Gerry there under false pretenses — whether premeditated or not — because she ends up fixating on a convent, hoping to join the local sisterhood, which would, of course, mean leaving Gerry and his liquor and his statins behind. The rhythms of Gerry's drinking problem start to get repetitive, but, alas, c'est la vie when it comes to the spinning wheel of addiction.

 










Despite the narrowness their visit's purpose acquires, “Midwinter Break” does make generous use of the city's locations, whether walking along the canals or through the De Pijp neighborhood shops or visiting the Rijksmuseum to awe at the Rembrandts. And the movie certainly looks picture-pleasant enough, as shot on location by recurring Ben Wheatley cinematographer Laurie Rose. There's also the added element of the film's leading actors, who both give expectedly committed turns in their roles — though one issue here is that the film's primarily target snowbirds-and-up audience doesn't necessarily turn out in theaters for adult-minded dramas (or anything at all) these days. “Midwinter Break” gets a lovely scene where we see septuagenarians (or one of them, anyway) sharing a moment of actual physical intimacy. But Stella and Gerry never seem to actually enjoy a minute of this “vacation,” their joylessness ultimately infecting the audience.

Manville, who is the most interesting thing about every movie she's ever played in, delivers an emotionally charged speech in which she explains why she has displaced all her life's unhappiness into dreams of the sisterhood, and onto God. Her Stella is maddeningly, frustratingly pious, especially when contrasted against her husband's secularity, until she finally opens up. It's certainly one of Manville's best performances since playing the surrogate mother to a dressmaking control freak in “Phantom Thread” or a hapless, drifting alcoholic in “Another Year” made the long-working British actress something of an item here in the States. But god, if the revelations that come out of Stella's overdue psychic purge don't make you want to catch the next plane out of Schiphol to get to anywhere but depressing here, I don't know what will.

 










“Midwinter Break” opens in theaters on Friday, February 20, from Focus Features.

Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band are bringing their politically charged Land of Hope and Dreams tour to North America in the spring for a run of arena and stadium dates. It kicks off March 31 in Minneapolis at the Target Center, and wraps up May 27 at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. Ticket sales start on Friday.


	“We are living through dark, disturbing and dangerous times, but do not despair — the cavalry is coming!” Springsteen says in a statement. “Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band will be taking the stage this spring from Minneapolis to California to Texas to Washington, D.C. for the Land of Hope And Dreams American Tour. We will be rocking your town in celebration and in defense of America — American democracy, American freedom, our American Constitution and our sacred American dream — all of which are under attack by our wannabe king and his rogue government in Washington, D.C. Everyone, regardless of where you stand or what you believe in, is welcome — so come on out and join the United Free Republic of E Street Nation for an American spring of Rock ‘n' Rebellion! I'll see you there!” 

	











	Last summer, Springsteen and the E Street Band played stadiums in Europe on the initial leg of the Land of Hope and Dreams Tour. “The mighty E Street Band is here tonight to call upon the righteous power of art, of music, of rock & roll, in dangerous times,” he told the crowd on opening night. “In my home, the America I love, the America I've written about, and has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration. Tonight, we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experience to rise with us, raise your voices against the authoritarianism, and let freedom ring. This is ‘Land of Hope and Dreams.'”


	This took place before Donald Trump flooded Minneapolis with ICE officers, resulting in the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. Springsteen responded to the tragedies with the protest song “Streets of Minneapolis,” which he performed Jan. 30 during a surprise appearance at Tom Morello's A Concert of Solidarity & Resistance to Defend Minnesota! at the Minneapolis club First Avenue.

	Earlier that month, Springsteen made a guest appearance at the annual Light of Days benefit concert. “Right now we are living through incredibly critical times,” he said that night. “The United States, the ideals and the value for which it stood for the past 250 years, is being tested like it has never been in modern times. Those values and those ideals have never been as endangered as they are right now.”


	“If you believe in the power of law and that no one stands above it,” he continued, “if you stand against heavily-armed masked federal troops invading an American city, using gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens, if you believe you don't deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president, as the mayor of the city said: ICE should get the fuck out of Minneapolis.”


	If Springsteen sticks to roughly the same set as Europe last summer, expect plenty of politically-themed songs like “Rainmaker,” “Long Walk Home,” and Bob Dylan's “Chimes of Freedom.” It's also a near-certainty he'll play “Streets of Minneapolis” as well.  The routing itself sends a message by beginning in Minneapolis and wrapping up near Trump's backyard in D.C.

Chloe Weir got her first camera, a Polaroid, when she was seven, and she'd often bring it  on tour with her dad. Around 2020, she became the official photographer for Dead & Company, capturing Bobby, his bandmates, and their fans on her Sony A7 III. “I was like, ‘I'll do it!' ” Chloe told Rolling Stone in 2024. “My dad loves that I get to do what I love, alongside him doing what he loves. We get to be, at the end of the day, working together.” Here are some of her favorite photos of her dad over the years, with captions in her own words.

Jan. 4, 2024, Mexico

My dad introduced me to photography when I was little, and we'd always have fun experimenting with our cameras. This was one of those times, taken while we were in Mexico for his Dead Ahead festival.

Dec. 8, 2024, Washington, D.C.

Here I captured my parents outside the John F. Kennedy Center right before attending the 47th annual Kennedy Center Honors. My father, along with the rest of the Grateful Dead, was one of the year's honorees for their contribution to American culture through the arts. 

June 25, 2022, Wrigley Field, Chicago

Whenever I saw my dad and Mickey together, they were laughing and smiling. Here they are at Wrigley Field, about to go on stage for the second set. 

March 11, 2025, Los Angeles

In preparation for their Sphere residency, Dead & Company had rehearsals last spring. In moments between songs with the band, my dad would often alter his ever-evolving guitar tone.

Feb. 2, 2024, Northern California

Both in his upbringing and adult life, my dad worked as a cowboy on California and Wyoming ranches. He began wearing cowboy hats in his ranch days, and they became a staple of his look, as seen in the shape of his shadow in the image above. 

Feb. 2, 2024, Northern California

May 23, 2022, Hawaii

Here, my dad was making massive bubbles to amaze my youngest cousin. No matter how exceptionally wise he became with age, his youthful wonder always remained.

Feb. 2, 2024, Northern California

He would walk in nature daily while meditating. This was a rare occurrence where he had shoes on; most often, he would go barefoot.

The actor was charged with two counts after allegedly punching two men and causing chaos at bars

The actor Shia LaBeouf was arrested early on Tuesday for alleged battery in New Orleans after apparently spending the long weekend partying across the city during Mardi Gras.

The New Orleans police department confirmed that at approximately 12.45am on Tuesday officers were called to Faubourg Marigny, located next to the French Quarter, the heart of the revelry, where LaBeouf was allegedly becoming increasingly aggressive at Royal Street Inn and Bar.

Court documents state that the bar manager attempted to escort LaBeouf out of the bar, during which the actor allegedly tried to hit him. Then after being removed, the actor allegedly punched one male patron who was helping the bar manager, before returning and punching a second man in the nose.

LaBeouf was then held down by bystanders until police arrived and he was taken to a hospital. He was later discharged, arrested and charged with two counts of simple battery. 
 He is scheduled to make an initial court appearance on Tuesday afternoon, just as the culmination of New Orleans's weeks-long, annual celebration of carnival hits its climax.

Thousands of people, mostly in various costumes, gathered in and outside Royal Street Inn and Bar later Tuesday. A bartender and a bouncer at the establishment said LeBeouf was not welcome back after his release from custody.

The celebrity gossip outlet TMZ posted a video of LaBeouf, purportedly taken early Tuesday morning, in which he is shirtless and exchanging words with another person. The video then reportedly shows the actor being attended to by paramedics.

Reports of LaBeouf engaging in unruly behavior across New Orleans have surfaced for several days. Robert Skuse, the doorman of Ms Mae's, a local bar, told the Hollywood Reporter the actor showed up in a “somewhat belligerent state”.

“​​In the middle of the mayhem, he did the ‘Do you know who I am?' bit,” Skuse said.

LaBeouf was reportedly asked to leave after trying to get behind the bar and serve drinks to customers.

LaBeouf has previously discussed his struggles with sobriety, crediting fellow actors Mel Gibson, Sean Penn and Josh Brolin for their help. He attended court-mandated rehab after a 2017 arrest in Savannah, Georgia, an experience that inspired his semi-autobiographical film, Honey Boy.

In 2020, FKA twigs, the English singer whose real name is Tahliah Barnett, sued LaBeouf for sexual battery, assault and infliction of emotional distress, alleging a pattern of “relentless” abuse.

In the lawsuit and in an interview with the New York Times, Barnett said LaBeouf, whom she dated from 2018 to 2019 after meeting on the set of Honey Boy, knowingly exposed her to a sexually transmitted infection, attempted to strangle her and slammed her against a car. LaBeouf has denied all allegations of wrongdoing. The pair reached a settlement in July 2025.

LaBeouf's representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Deep strike drones operated by the Security Service of Ukraine successfully hit a large Russian chemicals plant that supplies the country's explosives production, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent.

The attack on the Metafrax Chemicals plant in Perm Krai was carried out overnight between Feb. 16-17 by deep strike specialists from the SBU's Alpha unit, which regularly strikes targets deep inside Russian territory. 

The facility, a home to methanol, urotropine, urea and pentaerythritol production — all precursors for weapons-grade explosives — is under international sanctions, the SBU said.

Local Telegram channels reported explosions heard in the town of Gubakha, which serves the factory.

Perm Krai Governor Dmitry Makhonin confirmed a Ukrainian drone attack in the region but did not provide further details, only reporting that no casualties were recorded.

The facility was already attack by Ukrainian deep strike drones before — on that occasion, belonging to the military intelligence agency HUR — in September 2025.

Gubakha lies around 1,600 kilometers from the nearest Ukrainian-controlled territory, showcasing the growing and consistent reach of Kyiv's deep strike program.

Over the last year, Ukrainian long-range drones operated by the Armed Forces and intelligence agencies have targeted Russian oil infrastructure and military-related industry with increasing frequency and success.

Reporter

Francis Farrell is a reporter at the Kyiv Independent. He is the co-author of War Notes, the Kyiv Independent's weekly newsletter about the war. For the second year in a row, the Kyiv Independent received a grant from the Charles Douglas-Home Memorial Trust to support his front-line reporting for the year 2025-2026. Francis won the Prix Bayeux Calvados-Normandy for war correspondents in the young reporter category in 2023, and was nominated for the European Press Prize in 2024.

Francis speaks Ukrainian and Hungarian and is an alumnus of Leiden University in The Hague and University College London. He has previously worked as a managing editor at the online media project Lossi 36, as a freelance journalist and documentary photographer, and at the OSCE and Council of Europe field missions in Albania and Ukraine. 



""Discussions focused on practical issues and the mechanics of possible solutions,"" Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov said.







The attack on the Metafrax Chemicals plant in Perm Krai was carried out overnight between Feb. 16-17 by deep strike specialists from the SBU's Alpha unit.

Presidential aide Nikolai Patrushev called the European raids on shadow fleet ships ""piracy,"" and expressed concern that the next step would be a full-fledged blockade.

The most difficult period was October, when Russia struck the company 25 times and took out nearly 60% of Ukraine's gas production.

The Ilsky oil refinery in Krasnodar Krai, which supplies fuel to Russian troops, processes 6.42 million tons of oil annually, according to Ukraine's General Staff. 

DTEK has set aside 150 million euros from its own pockets, but needs help from partners to close the rest by the end of the year.

The civilian car was struck in the town of Mykolaivka, located east of the city of Sloviansk and only around ten kilometers from the front line. 



In Odesa, long-range Russian strikes on infrastructure and residential homes saw three civilians injured, according to regional governor Serhii Lysak. 

The Kyiv Independent's War Crimes Investigations Unit will present a new documentary, “Torture Culture,” exposing the systematic torture of Ukrainian civilians in Russian captivity and highlighting Russia's use of torture throughout history.

The number includes 890 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

Lufthansa can finally start making money on its Boeing 787 Dreamliners after a certification debacle left one of its most lucrative cabins largely empty for months.

The German flag carrier said on Monday that it will begin selling tickets for its Allegris business class on the 787. Allegris, Lufthansa's signature cabin concept, spans economy, premium economy, business, and first class, but the business class rollout has been particularly tricky.

The program first launched on the Airbus A350 in May 2024, with the cabin spanning the entire plane. The first Allegris-equipped 787 followed in October 2025, but certification of business class dragged on due to the cabin's complexity: there are five staggered seat configurations in a single airplane cabin — some with doors or more legroom, others with extra-long beds.

This is because the Dreamliner's geometry — including a slightly tighter usable footprint and different fuselage contouring compared to the A350 — made it harder to demonstrate to regulators that passengers could evacuate quickly from every seat, whether staggered, partially enclosed, or fully cocooned, in an emergency.

The result? For months, only four of the 28 business class seats could be sold — the front-row Business Class Suites — leaving the remaining 24 empty. Business class is a cash cow for airlines, and by flying most of the cabin empty as competitors pour investments into their own premium seats, Lufthansa was essentially leaving money on the table.

It has been a particularly costly headache for a carrier in the midst of a multi-year turnaround plan to restore profitability after years of financial pressure from frequent maintenance, aircraft shortages, rising operating costs, and labor strikes.

Lufthansa even opted for an already-certified business-class seat to retrofit onto its Airbus A380s rather than risk another prolonged and costly certification process.

But the saga is nearing the finish line. Beginning April 15, Lufthansa plans to carry passengers in 25 business-class seats on its 787s, with three remaining blocked in the second row of the cabin.

Bookings are open, though it's unclear whether the news indicates the seats have been fully certified or if that's just Lufthansa's expected timeline.

Lufthansa said ""Classic"" seats — one of the Allegris categories available — are free to secure with the premium fare.

The others require an extra fee: this includes the first-row suites, the ""Privacy"" seat next to the window, the ""Extra Space"" seat with more legroom, and the ""Extra Long Bed"" with an over seven-foot sleeping surface.

The three second-row seats that are blocked — and not yet available for booking — are two privacy seats and an extra-legroom seat.

Lufthansa flies eight Allegris-equipped Dreamliners and expects to have 29 by the end of 2027.

They are set to first fly from Frankfurt to Rio de Janeiro, Bogota, Cape Town, Shanghai, Hyderabad, Hong Kong, and Austin; New York-JFK and Los Angeles join the roster in June, followed by Delhi in July.

As part of Lufthansa's greater multibillion-dollar fleet overhaul plan, Allegris is also being fit onto the airline's existing A350s and Boeing 747-8s, as well as its future, yet-to-be-certified Boeing 777Xs.

A similar spacing issue on the 747 double-deckers' upper level means it will have a split business class: the lower deck will have Allegris, while upstairs will feature the plane's original cabin.

The crypto market continued to exhibit weakness on Tuesday morning, broadly following a tech selloff across U.S. equities and a correction in the price of precious metals.

Bitcoin trades at $68,000, down 1.25% since midnight UTC, while Nasdaq futures and gold lost 0.55% and 2.4% respectively over the same period.

Altcoins also lost ground as popular memecoins PEPE, DOGE and TRUMP led the drawdown, losing between 3.5% and 4.5%.

The tech selloff has been driven by fears around artificial intelligence and how it might disrupt several industries. Bitcoin has been closely tied to Nasdaq since Feb. 3, with the correlation coefficient indicator rising from negative 0.68 to positive 0.72 over the past two weeks.

Gold, meanwhile, is currently trading at $4,928 after failing to establish a level of support above $5,000. The precious metal hit a record high of $5,600 on Jan. 28 before a historic 21.5% correction over the subsequent four days.

Gemini Space Station Inc. (GEMI) is parting ways with three top executives, including its chief operating officer (COO), chief financial officer (CFO) and chief legal officer (CLO), the exchange disclosed in a filing on Tuesday.

COO Marshall Beard, CFO Dan Chen and CLO Tyler Meade are all leaving effective immediately, according to the filing. Beard has also resigned from Gemini's board of directors. The company said his resignation was not the result of any disagreement related to its operations, policies or practices.

The stock fell more than 10% in early Tuesday trading, underperforming most of its peers. 

The departures come just days after Gemini announced it would shut down its crypto exchange operations in the U.K., European Union (EU) and Australia.

The exchange said it plans to cut roughly 25% of its global workforce and refocus its strategy on the U.S. market and prediction markets, marking a sweeping retrenchment only months after the company went public.

Gemini said it does not plan to appoint a successor COO at this time. Instead, co-founder Cameron Winklevoss will assume many of Beard's responsibilities, including revenue-generating duties, in addition to his existing role.

The board appointed Danijela Stojanovic, Gemini's chief accounting officer since May 2025, as interim CFO, and named Kate Freedman, currently associate general counsel and corporate secretary, as interim general counsel, effective Tuesday.

At least one other higher-level staff member attached to Gemini's APAC division was let go on Tuesday as well, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Gemini did not immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment.

When we talk about the cost of AI infrastructure, the focus is usually on Nvidia and GPUs — but memory is an increasingly important part of the picture. As hyperscalers prepare to build out billions of dollars worth of new data centers, the price for DRAM chips has jumped roughly 7x in the last year. 

At the same time, there's a growing discipline in orchestrating all that memory to make sure the right data gets to the right agent at the right time. The companies that master it will be able to make the same queries with fewer tokens, which can be the difference between folding and staying in business.

Semiconductor analyst Doug O'Laughlin has an interesting look at the importance of memory chips on his Substack, where he talks with Val Bercovici, chief AI officer at Weka. They're both semiconductor guys, so the focus is more on the chips than the broader architecture; the implications for AI software are pretty significant too.

I was particularly struck by this passage, in which Bercovici looks at the growing complexity of Anthropic's prompt-caching documentation:

The tell is if we go to Anthropic's prompt caching pricing page. It started off as a very simple page six or seven months ago, especially as Claude Code was launching — just “use caching, it's cheaper.” Now it's an encyclopedia of advice on exactly how many cache writes to pre-buy. You've got 5-minute tiers, which are very common across the industry, or 1-hour tiers — and nothing above. That's a really important tell. Then of course you've got all sorts of arbitrage opportunities around the pricing for cache reads based on how many cache writes you've pre-purchased.

The question here is how long Claude holds your prompt in cached memory: you can pay for a 5-minute window, or pay more for an hour-long window. It's much cheaper to draw on data that's still in the cache, so if you manage it right, you can save an awful lot. There is a catch though: every new bit of data you add to the query may bump something else out of the cache window. 

This is complex stuff, but the upshot is simple enough: Managing memory in AI models is going to be a huge part of AI going forward. Companies that do it well are going to rise to the top.

And there is plenty of progress to be made in this new field. Back in October, I covered a startup called TensorMesh that was working on one layer in the stack known as cache-optimization. 

Opportunities exist in other parts of the stack. For instance, lower down the stack, there's the question of how data centers are using the different types of memory they have. (The interview includes a nice discussion of when DRAM chips are used instead of HBM, although it's pretty deep in the hardware weeds.) Higher up the stack, end users are figuring out how to structure their model swarms to take advantage of the shared cache.

As companies get better at memory orchestration, they'll use fewer tokens and inference will get cheaper. Meanwhile, models are getting more efficient at processing each token, pushing the cost down still further. As server costs drop, a lot of applications that don't seem viable now will start to edge into profitability.

CBS forced The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to cancel an appearance by a Democrat up for election later this year, according to the host. The decision stems from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's repeated threats to punish network television stations that he believes are airing unbalanced political content.

“Texas State Rep. James Talarico, he was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,” host Stephen Colbert said on air on Monday night. “Then I was told in some uncertain terms that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on, and because my network clearly doesn't want us to talk about this, let's talk about this.”

The reason stems from a long-time Federal Communications Commission rule called the “Equal Time Rule,” which states that all candidates in an election should be offered equal airtime for their messaging on radio and broadcast channels.

Talarico is running against fellow Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett in the Texas Democratic primary slated for March 3. Both primary candidates are rising stars in the Democratic Party, and whoever wins will be in the race to flip the state's reliably Republican Senate seat currently held by Sen. John Cornyn.

The “Equal Time Rule” does not apply to streaming, nor does it apply to news interviews or talk show interviews with politicians.

Last month, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr signaled his intention to drop the exception for daytime and late-night TV talk shows, claiming that the programs are “motivated by partisan purposes.” In response to the news, Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez told Politico that “the FCC is now a political arm of this administration.”

Colbert said that Carr's letter was announcing the intention to drop the exception, but it wasn't a real policy change yet.

“He hasn't done away with it yet, but my network is unilaterally enforcing it as if he had,” Colbert said. “But I want to assure you, ladies and gentlemen, please, I want to assure you, this decision is for purely financial reasons.”

As a result of the network's pressure, Colbert has instead posted his interview with Tallarico on the Late Show's YouTube channel, though CBS even barred him from giving out a URL or a QR code for it on air.

Colbert also pointed out that this isn't the FCC's first attack on talk shows or Rep. Tallarico. Earlier this month, the FCC reportedly opened an investigation into ABC's “The View” talk show, promptly following an interview with Rep. Tallarico.

Republicans might have some reason to be afraid of Tallarico's chances to flip the Senate seat. Back in 2018, he flipped a reliably Republican seat in a county that was once referred to as a “conservative bastion.”

“I think that Donald Trump is worried that we're about to flip Texas,” Tallarico said in the Colbert interview posted on YouTube. “This is the party that ran against cancel culture, and now they're trying to control what we watch, what we say, what we read, and this is the most dangerous kind of cancel culture, the kind that comes from the top.”

2026 World Cup: Friendly match between Ghana and Mexico

Ghana continues to ramp up its preparations ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The Ghana Football Association has confirmed a crucial international friendly scheduled for May as part of their build-up program.

Ghana is set to face Mexico in an international friendly on May 22, 2026, marking the final stage before the 2026 World Cup kicks off.

Both teams will use this clash to assess players eligible for the tournament set to take place across Mexico, Canada, and the United States. Ghana's squad will feature talents from both the domestic league and European circuits, all under the watchful eye of coach Otto Addo.

With this match, Ghana's tally of preparatory fixtures rises to three, following earlier announcements of friendlies against Austria and Germany during the March international break.","{'href': 'https://ca.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports Canada'}","soccer"

Manchester United and Liverpool have been given Christian Pulisic transfer advice, with Tab Ramos telling GOAL that the USMNT star could be a “dangerous player” in the right Premier League team. The former Chelsea winger is seeing a return to English football speculated on after seeing his stock soar at AC Milan and delaying the signing of a new contract.

Pulisic spent four years at Stamford Bridge between 2019 and 2023, becoming a history-making Champions League winner with the Blues. He enjoyed plenty of highs in west London, hitting a Premier League hat-trick and landing major honours, but struggled to nail down a regular starting berth.

He jumped at the chance to take on an Italian job and has been posting personal bests with Milan. An impressive return of 17 goals was recorded last season, with game-changing individual standards being maintained while representing a team that has struggled for consistency as a collective.

Pulisic will be gracing a home World Cup with the United States this summer, potentially filling the captain's armband at times, and has some big decisions to make on his future. The offer of fresh terms at San Siro has been on the table for some time, with the 27-year-old seemingly unsure if his long-term future would be best served in his current surroundings.

Quizzed on whether Pulisic should be looking to stay put or explore other options, ex-USMNT star Ramos - speaking via an online casino - told GOAL: “It's hard to tell. Let's not forget that Milan is not a small club. This is a traditional team, historically one of the biggest clubs in the world. Of course there is always a desire to go back to the EPL because the EPL is the best league in the world. There is an attraction there.

“There is also the part where you can't blame the players. If there is a big difference in money and he feels like this is a good thing for him and his family, then it is something he is going to have to take. Looking at it without thinking about all of those things, I think he's in a good spot in Milan - he makes a difference there, he's an important player, in a great league and at a huge club. I'd like to see him stay there.”

Pressed further on whether Pulisic would fancy another shot at the Premier League, with some heavyweight outfits being credited with interest, Ramos added: “If you are talking about a club that is really putting a foot forward and has the ball, not talking about a bottom-of-the-table EPL team, then that could be a good scenario because Christian Pulisic in the final third is a dangerous player. I think where he could get into a bit of an issue is if he's middle-of-the-table down in a team that is sort of holding and countering - that's not necessarily his game.”

Former United defender Paul Parker told GOAL recently when asked if Pulisic would be a shrewd addition at Old Trafford: “When you look at him, you see someone that has got ability one-on-ones, can go either flank, beat somewhere there, but is just as good in the middle. He moves across and you don't have to ask him to run.

“When I saw his name pop up, he's been having a good time in Milan. You look at that and bringing someone from the Italian league, but he needed to get away from Chelsea. When leaving Chelsea, it doesn't matter what you say about him, to leave there and go to AC Milan, straight away you are thinking Franco Baresi and all of those players and that team they had in the 90s. It's a great move, what a great place to go.

“Opportunity to come back to the Premier League with Manchester United - wow, he would be one of the most famous American footballers ever with that behind him on his CV. I wouldn't put that to bed. I would try and keep that once alive for someone like that.”

Pulisic has reached double figures again for goals scored this season and is also said to be attracting admiring glances from north London rivals Arsenal and Tottenham. Milan are refusing to give up on contract talks and are under no immediate pressure to sell as they have ‘Captain America' tied to terms through to 2027 that include the option for a 12-month extension.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

	If you've been to a Pitbull show over the past couple years you may have noticed that Mr. Worldwide's signature bald n' bearded look is catching on among his fans, male and female. He even acknowledged the trend during a run of arena shows in the U.K. and Ireland last year, where he stared out at a sea of people dressed in black suits, bald caps and sunglasses meeting up outside of venues.

	Pitbull (born Armando Christian Pérez), shared with the BBC that thought the long-running trend filled his heart, telling the outlet, “every time I'm at a show, I let them know that when you put on a bald cap, I hope you're ready to have the time of your lives – it feels deeper than just music. It's the ultimate trophy to be able to go on stage and see all the hard work that you put into the music. I've been in the game for 25 years and to see every demographic, everybody [dressing up] at the shows is priceless.”


	Now Pitbill is turning the trend into a Guinness World Record book try when he'll attempt to set a record for the most people wearing bald caps at his BST Hyde Park headlining show in London on July 10.


	Organizers announced the attempt on Tuesday morning (Feb. 17), writing on X, “It's official. Let's make history. After the idea was championed by @gregjames on @BBCR1, we're on a mission to secure a GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS™ title for the largest gathering of people wearing bald caps and Pitbull needs YOU there in London's Hyde Park on Friday 10 July. Let's have a real good time! Dale.”

	











	Pitbull will gear up for the record attempt with a series of upcoming shows, including an appearance at the Stagecoach Music Festival in Indio, Calif. (April 24-26), followed by a run of shows in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Texas, Arizona, Utah and California before heading to Europe on June 23.

Like the “Eyes Wide Shut” star, Salem is a divorcee. He and his ex-wife, Navyn Salem, reportedly split in 2021.

Kidman's reps have not immediately returned Page Six's request for comment.

Reports that Salem is romantically pursuing Kidman come just one month after the “Big Little Lies” star and Urban, 58, finalized their divorce on Jan. 6.

The former couple, who tied the knot in June 2006, announced that they were separating in September 2025.

“Sometimes relationships just run their course,” a source told Page Six at the time, adding that Kidman “did not want the separation and was trying to save things.”

She officially filed for divorce from the country rocker on Sept. 30, citing “irreconcilable differences.”

The exes share daughters Sunday Rose, 17, and Faith Margaret, 15.

“Nicole spends a lot of time with her girls,” a source told People last month. “She loves family time.”

“She is refreshed and optimistic about the new year,” the insider also shared before adding that the newly single actress is “looking ahead to a busy and exciting year professionally too, with several projects coming up.”

As for Urban, he has since been romantically linked to both his 25-year-old guitarist, Maggie Baugh, and the up-and-coming country singer Karley Scott Collins.

While those romance rumors were ultimately dismissed by Collins and a close friend of Baugh's, an insider claimed that Urban had moved in with a new love interest last month.

“I hear he has someone, which is why the girls are publicly supporting Mom,” the source alleged to the Daily Mail last month.

“People think they are even living together,” the insider added. “Look, teen girls love their dads, so there's a reason they're making it three against one.”
