                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Our soccer expert offers his Benfica vs Real Madrid predictions, ahead of Tuesday's Champions League clash, at 3:00pm ET (2/17). Our betting expert expects a relatively open game, with the Portuguese side capable of upsetting Los Blancos once more. Real Madrid finished with an xG total of 1.51, despite dominating possession. Benfica exploited their opponents' problems at right-back, with left winger Andreas Schjelderup scoring twice. Since then, Alvaro Arbeloa has opted to move Fede Valverde back into midfield. However, neither Dani Carvajal nor Trent Alexander-Arnold has managed to build up much match fitness following recent injuries. Jude Bellingham and Eder Militao are out injured, while Kylian Mbappe has not trained fully in the week before this game. Backing Benfica to win or draw carries an implied probability of 53.5%. Raul Asencio's late red card in the last meeting rules him out for Tuesday. Against more attack-minded opponents, Real Madrid conceded 1.5 goals per game in the UCL league phase. Aside from long-term absentee Dodi Lukebakio, Benfica's attack should be at full strength. Schjelderup should cause problems again, while Vangelis Pavlidis has been prolific in Portugal this term. Backing the hosts to score over 1.5 goals offers value, with an implied probability of 41.7%. However, the pattern resumed in league games against Rayo Vallecano and Valencia. Mourinho is unlikely to take unnecessary risks from the first whistle here. However, he knows that Benfica need to make home advantage count, so the match should eventually open up. Goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin scored a dramatic fourth goal in stoppage time and sealed progress for Jose Mourinho's team. That result also denied Real Madrid direct passage into the round of 16. They must now negotiate a two-legged play-off tie against the same opposition. Since that remarkable night, Benfica have lost further ground in the Portuguese title race after only drawing with Tondela. Meanwhile, Real Madrid bounced back from that setback with league wins over Rayo Vallecano and Valencia. Benfica expected lineup: Trubin, Dahl, T. Araujo, Otamendi, Dedic, Barreiro, Aursnes, Schjelderup, Sudakov, Prestianni, Pavlidis Real Madrid expected lineup: Courtois, Carreras, Huijsen, Rudiger, Alexander-Arnold, Camavinga, Tchouameni, Valverde, Guler, Vinicius, Mbappe</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With American soccer star Christian Pulisic still awaiting a long-term contract offer from his current club, AC Milan, speculation over a possible return to the English Premier League – widely considered the world's top domestic league – has started to build. And while Pulisic could remain on that current deal, Milan would risk losing him for an undervalued fee should he push for a move. Earlier in his career, Pulisic spent 4 seasons with Premier League giants, Chelsea FC, to some mixed results. While playing an important role in their run to winning the 2021 UEFA Champions League, he also failed to start more than 20 Premier League games in any individual season going progressively downward from 19 his first year to just 8 in his final year. On the latest episode of Unfiltered Soccer hosted by Tim Howard and Landon Donovan, the two U.S. legends discussed whether a move back to England would be wise for the Hershey-born attacker. I remember Mo Salah at Chelsea,” said Howard in comparing Pulisic to two players that similarly came to the Premier League early in their careers, struggled, left and eventually returned, becoming two of the greatest players the league has ever seen. “I sort of feel like that with Christian Pulisic as well,” continued Howard. “I backed him to the hills at Chelsea. Unfortunately, he didn't get the rub of the green, went through some different coaches, and then he went off. For Donovan, questions about Pulisic making the leap from Italy's Serie A to the English Premier League have nothing to do with talent but rather durability. “This is a scenario where I think if he is motivated and wants to go prove it, he is capable of it – going to one of these big clubs in England. The one hesitation I have... and this is just speaking from personal experience... the physical part of it is a real thing, man.” This season, Pulisic appeared to be in the best form of his career before a low-grade hamstring tear in October, and bout of hip bursitis in January-February caused him to miss several matches. And to do it, thirty-five, forty, forty-five times a year at that pace is really hard. “I don't know, physically, if he could do it every single week for two or three years, like some of these guys.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>KANSAS CITY (Feb. 17, 2026) — Kansas City Current forward/midfielder Ally Sentnor has been named to the United States Women's National Team (USWNT) roster for the 2026 SheBelieves Cup presented by Visa, as announced by U.S. Soccer on Tuesday. Sentnor is part of the 26-player roster for one of the most prestigious four-team tournaments in women's soccer. The tournament concludes at Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, N.J., on Saturday, March 7, with the U.S. taking on Colombia at 2:30 p.m. CT. All three matches will be broadcast on TBS, TNT and/or truTV, Telemundo and Universo and streamed on HBO Max and Peacock. Sentnor's initial USWNT call-up was in November 2024, and she has been called into all but one senior camp since. She has six goals and three assists in 15 caps with seven starts entering the 2026 SheBelieves Cup. Most recently, Sentnor had a two-goal performance in a 6-0 rout of Paraguay on Jan. 24 to open her 2026 scoring account. It was her second brace in a U.S. uniform, the first which came on June 3, 2025, in a friendly with Jamaica. Her first senior team cap was on Nov. 30, 2024, against England in front of over 78,000 fans at Wembley Stadium. Sentnor's breakthrough was a year ago at the 2025 SheBelieves Cup where she finished the event with two goals and an assist. She scored in her first senior national team start on Feb. 20, 2025, against Colombia to become the first U.S. player to score her first USWNT goal in the SheBelieves Cup Tournament. A month before her 2025 SheBelieves Cup breakthrough, Sentnor was named the 2024 U.S. Soccer Young Female Player of the Year. Sign up for latest news, offers & more!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The annual 2026 SheBelieves Cup will kick off on March 1, and U.S. women's national team head coach Emma Hayes has named a 26-player roster ahead of the tournament. A tournament blend of Concacaf and CONMEBOL opposition will test the Stars and Stripes with styles that they could see again during qualifiers. "Three quality games in quick succession also allow us to replicate conditions that will prepare us for the World Cup qualifying campaign this fall. As we gain more experience, I expect our standards to keep improving." Gameday rosters can be rotated to feature any of the 26 selected players. This is the first time since the 2025 SheBelieves Cup that a USWNT roster has not featured an uncapped player. Hayes has given 32 players their first caps in 32 games as manager. No other full-time USWNT manager named more than 36 different starters in their first 30 games as head coach. Goalkeepers (3): Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign FC; 7), Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals; 5), Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United, ENG; 4) National team veterans Sophia Wilson and Catarina Macario did not make the cut for the SheBelieves Cup roster for varying fitness reasons, with Hayes admitting on Tuesday that the pair would likely have been part of the group if they were fit enough to take part. Though Hayes and Wilson both wanted the player to take part in March's USWNT matches, the Thorns ultimately decided Wilson was not fit enough for the opportunity this time around. "The return to play protocol has just not given her enough time, I think, for her to be in the place she wanted to be in so it's right that she's not in the squad, however much I want her to be. As for Macario, Hayes disclosed that the player is dealing with a heel injury. She did not comment on Macario's club situation, which has been the source of some speculation in recent weeks -- she has not played for Chelsea since December 10 and has since been left off the team's UEFA Women's Champions League roster, all while being linked to a move to the NWSL's San Diego Wave. "My understanding is that she has a heel injury. She's getting closer and closer every day," Hayes said before adding that Macario's exact timeline to return to the pitch is unclear. "I don't know when that's going to be but she's not available for selection." Other players like defender Avery Patterson and midfielder Croix Bethune, the latter of whom was part of a blockbuster trade to the Kansas City Current last week, were also left off because they do not have enough reps under their belts during preseason. Their absences, though, afforded opportunities to another batch of rising USWNT stars -- midfielder Riley Tiernan and forward Maddie Dahlien, who earned their first caps last month, will now join a more experienced version of the U.S. team for a SheBelieves Cup that simulates a tournament setting. Forward Jameese Joseph also got the nod in large part because Wilson and Macario were unavailable. "If Cat Macario and Sophia Wilson were available for selection, they would've been selected as the [No.] 9s," Hayes said before reinforcing her longstanding project to expand the player pool.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Sky Blues trailed Boro by two points heading into Monday's contest, but after Wright's devastating performance in front of goal it's Frank Lampard's side that are now in pole position to return to the Premier League for the first time since 2000–01. In a game that could have a decisive impact on the title race, Wright proved his quality and emphatically decided the clash. He then showcased his strength and physicality, using his imposing frame to shield the ball and tuck home a first-time weak-foot finish into the corner. His physicality saw him gain the upper hand in most aerial duels and his ability to read the play led directly to Coventry's second. Wright took advantage of a split-second defensive lapse, getting across his marker to rifle a vicious strike into the bottom corner of Sol Brynn's goal. A goal from USMNT midfielder Riley McGree got Boro back into the game, but Wright kept his cool from the penalty spot after Matt Targett had been penalised for handball to bury his effort from 12 yards into the side netting. “In games like this, it's so important to be clinical in the right moments,” Lampard said, praising Wright's performance following the match. This weekend, fellow Championship striker Patrick Agyemang scored his 10th goal of the season for Derby County. Not to be outshined, Wright's hat-trick performance on Monday served as a resounding response in the battle for a striker spot in the USMNT roster. A sensational start of the season from Wright was crowned by the brace he scored against Australia during an October international friendly, yet he then went 15 appearances for club and country without a goal. Five goals in his last three appearances has helped Wright to rediscover his mojo, and it's impossible to imagine that Pochettino won't have been impressed by what he saw.

(Tuesday, February 17, 2026) – Charlotte FC today announced the Scotland National Team selected the Club's training facility as Team Base Camp training site for FIFA World Cup 2026™.

The Scots are led by captain Andy Robertson (Liverpool), Serie A MVP award winner Scott McTominay (Napoli), and former Charlotte FC Head Coach Dean Smith disciple John McGinn (Aston Villa). The match against African champions Senegal will take place on Sunday, May 31.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Scotland's national soccer team will use Charlotte FC's training facility as its base camp for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the club announced Tuesday. The Scottish FA selected the 52,000-square-foot facility in east Charlotte as its official training site and team headquarters as Scotland prepares for Group C matches against Haiti, Morocco, and Brazil. "Charlotte FC have a top MLS training facility with everything we need to prepare for our matches," Scotland Head Coach Steve Clarke said. "Our base in Charlotte will be convenient for the airport, with flights around two hours to Boston and Miami for our group stage matches." The facility, which opened in 2023, features eight soccer fields, locker rooms, a cafeteria designed for player nutrition, and a 2,800-square-foot weight room. It serves as the home base for Charlotte FC's first team, second team Crown Legacy FC, and all academy age groups. The squad is led by captain Andy Robertson of Liverpool, Serie A MVP Scott McTominay of Napoli, and Aston Villa midfielder John McGinn, who played under former Charlotte FC head coach Dean Smith. Club Technical Director Tommy Wilson began his career as the Football Development Officer for the Scottish FA, and Director of High Performance John Currie spent more than a decade in Scottish football with Celtic FC and Heart of Midlothian FC. "We are delighted to confirm Charlotte as our training base," Clarke said. "Charlotte FC's staff could not have been more welcoming. "This summer brings the biggest sporting event North America has seen this century, and we're honored for Charlotte FC to be named a team base camp for a major European nation," Coleman said. The announcement marks the second consecutive summer Charlotte FC's facilities have been used for a major FIFA event. The USMNT will face African champions Senegal on May 31.</p>

Scotland head coach Steve Clarke told UK media outlets last week that “we have secured Charlotte as a base for the team.” That news became official Tuesday, and Clarke expanded on why Charlotte FC's place fit what he was looking for. “We are delighted to confirm Charlotte as our training base,” Clarke stated via a release. “We looked at the FIFA-nominated options, against our own predetermined criteria, and Charlotte FC (has) a top MLS training facility with everything we need to prepare for our matches. “I'd like to add that Charlotte FC's staff could not have been more welcoming. As most competing nations have discovered, travel will be an important factor in this World Cup. Our base in Charlotte will be convenient for the airport, with flights around two hours to Boston and Miami for our group stage matches.

PUNCH Online outlines key things to know about the case.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nigeria are set to miss out on a second successive edition of the Fifa World Cup There is a mix of hope and frustration as Nigeria supporters await Fifa's decision on allegations that DR Congo fielded ineligible players during Africa's 2026 World Cup play-offs. The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) submitted a complaint to Fifa in December, arguing that Leopards players such as Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Axel Tuanzebe - both former England youth internationals - were ineligible because Congolese law does not allow dual citizenship. "Any claims that a ruling has been made are false," NFF director of communications Demola Olajire said. "Our contention is that Fifa was deceived into clearing them." This is not the first time African qualification campaigns have spilled into courtrooms and committee rooms. Such episodes often expose the tension between Fifa's statutes, which prioritise sporting nationality as recognised by the governing body, and national laws which may impose stricter definitions of citizenship. Under these rules, a player may ask to change the association they represent only once and the process requires a written and substantiated request which must be approved by Fifa's players' status committee. That discrepancy between domestic laws and Fifa's eligibility framework may have fuelled the legal ambiguity upon which Nigeria's hopes hinge. The NFF argues that some Congolese players held European passports, a point not directly accounted for in Fifa's eligibility checks, and contends that if those domestic laws were breached then the players should not have been cleared to participate. The petition also suggested that Fifa may have been provided with incomplete or misleading documentation when eligibility approvals were sought for the players, a claim which, if upheld, could raise wider governance concerns. With a decision expected from Fifa, a ruling in Nigeria's favour could prompt closer scrutiny of player documentation for other African nations, with federations keen to avoid similar challenges. When a formal protest reaches Fifa, there are several possible outcomes: Investigation and administrative sanction: Fifa could investigate and, if it finds breaches in the clearance process, sanction the federation (eg fines, warnings) but leave results unchanged. Historically, such sporting sanctions are applied when administrative or player registration rules are clearly and materially breached, such as with falsification or deliberate misrepresentation.

We already knew that this was going to be a huge, huge thing," said Jess Knust, store manager. The FIFA Men's World Cup is 114 days away, and soccer stores across the Kansas City Metro are stocking gear to be ready for the roaring rush of soccer fans. One of those places is Soccer Master, a Missouri-based retailer tucked away on 135th Street in Overland Park, Kansas. You could say the store is getting pumped for this kick of fandom expected this summer that'll reach well beyond their normal KC customer base. "Everyone's so excited," Jess Knust, store manager, said. She said she might need to add two or three more full-time employees to her roster of six if the store needs more help with orders. As for the soccer merch, for the last two months, Soccer Master has been accumulating over 150 World Cup-related pieces. Knust will be turning one large corner of the space into a "World Cup hub" with hats, balls, jerseys and signs. "So we're working on getting all the different federations here into store, and if I'm not going to carry it in store, I will be able to get it," Knust said. She tells KMBC 9 that Adidas and Puma home kits are easy to come by right now. In-store, she has home jerseys from Argentina, Spain, Mexico, Germany, Belgium, Colombia, Italy, Portugal, Austria and Algeria. Knust tells KMBC 9 she can also customize any of these jerseys. Away kits are expected sometime in April or May. She's already sold at least 100 Argentina jerseys, if not more, and expects USA merch to be the highest in demand. Knust tells KMBC 9 the USA gear will show up in March or April. She is also selling a whole set of mini World Cup balls. "Italy is one of those teams that is playing in the playoff, so we're not sure if they've made the tournament yet, but it looks good," Knust said. After the playoffs in early March, she expects more international soccer gear will break away. "I can't wait to see and meet people that are coming into town from out of town, and it's just going to be a really good time. Knust said she's still working out where Soccer Master will host pop-up sales and which partnerships the store will create with other businesses for the World Cup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The harshest punishment has been reserved for Juventus CEO Comolli, who has been banned from all football activities until March 31, 2026. The report paints a disturbing picture of the interval, stating that Comolli displayed an "aggressive and seriously intimidating attitude" towards referee La Penna. He was only prevented from doing so by the physical intervention of the Juventus coaching staff and other club employees, who had to restrain him. Furthermore, Comolli was cited for using "gravely insulting" language, a tirade that reportedly continued even outside the officials' dressing room long after the teams had separated. The image of a high-ranking club executive having to be held back by his own technical team has resulted in a €15,000 fine to accompany Comolli's lengthy suspension. However, he was not the only Juventus director to let his frustrations boil over. Chiellini, a man who spent decades battling in these high-stakes fixtures as a player, also found himself in the crosshairs of the sporting judge. The legendary former defender turned director will be sidelined from official duties until February 27, 2026. While his conduct was deemed less physically threatening than Comolli's, the report noted that Chiellini contested the referee's performance in a "disrespectful manner." Chiellini did not mince words in the aftermath, turning his fire on referee designator Gianluca Rocchi and demanding systemic change. "We cannot talk about football after what happened today. Something truly unacceptable happened today, no matter whether it happens to us or someone else," Chiellini raged, clearly feeling that the standard of officiating has reached a crisis point. "Starting tomorrow it seems VAR must change, because it is unacceptable that so many errors continue to happen even in big matches like this." "Clearly, as a club we feel today is very embarrassing. It's a disgrace what happened today, and we feel strongly as a club from the ownership, fans, players, to the coach, this must not happen again," Comolli remarked. He lamented the repetitive nature of these controversies, adding: "It happens again and again... tonight is a summary of what we have seen this season. For a match like this, with the whole world watching."</p>

 NFF lodged a complaint with FIFA challenging the eligibility status of certain DR Congo players

The Nigeria Football Federation, NFF, has dismissed rumours regarding a decision from FIFA concerning Nigeria's protest against the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) over allegations of fielding ineligible players.

The controversy arose after Nigeria's Super Eagles were eliminated by DR Congo in a penalty shootout during the World Cup play-offs for the African zone last November, ending their chances of qualifying for the intercontinental play-offs later this year.

In response, the NFF lodged a formal complaint with FIFA, challenging the eligibility status of certain players from the DR Congo squad.

The NFF's stance is based on Congolese laws that do not recognize dual nationality, suggesting that some players representing the Leopards may have held European passports.

However, the NFF has now confirmed that FIFA has not rendered any judgment on the issue.

Ademola Olajire, NFF's Director of Communications, labeled reports indicating a ruling favouring either Nigeria or DR Congo as “false.”

“There is no decision from FIFA at this time. Any claims that a ruling has been made are false. FIFA has not communicated any verdict to the NFF or the Congolese federation,” Olajire said via 234Sports.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Champions League trophy on display at holders Paris Saint-Germain's Parc des Princes stadium last August Franck Fife/Getty Images Last month's draw means we can forecast the possible matchups in the round of 16, which starts in March. As the league phase's top eight sit with their feet up, the 16 teams who finished ninth to 24th will compete over two legs this midweek and next to decide who joins them in the Champions League's last 16. And there are plenty of potential narratives unfolding. Could Jose Mourinho torment former employers Real Madrid again? Can Monaco overcome Ligue 1 rivals and defending champions PSG? Last season, the Champions League introduced a revamped format. Instead of four-team groups competing against each other home and away, 36 teams were all together in one league table. Real Madrid have won the Champions League 15 times but failed to finish in this season's top eight after a dramatic 4-2 defeat against Benfica in their final league-phase game. Goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin scored a last-gasp winner, sending former Madrid manager Mourinho flying down the touchline in celebration. Madrid have a chance to redeem themselves after subsequently being drawn against… Benfica in the play-offs. Hoping to cause further upsets, Bodo/Glimt beat Manchester City and Atletico Madrid to end the league phase in 23rd place. The Norwegians' prize is a tie against Inter, last year's beaten finalists. Newcastle United, who face Qarabag of Azerbaijan, and Juventus, up against Turkey's Galatasaray, are among the other teams competing in the play-off round. The clubs who finished ninth to 16th were seeded in the draw, so will get to play their tie's second legs at home. We will know which side of the bracket these pairs fall on after the next knockout-stage draw (more on that below), but this is a look at the possible round-of-16 matchups. Beyond that, the picture is less clear until the draw, but there could be all-Premier League quarter-finals between Manchester City and Arsenal, and Liverpool or Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea. Spain's big two Real Madrid and Barcelona cannot meet until at least the semi-finals, and last year's finalists — PSG and Inter — are on different sides of the bracket again. The teams who finished first to fourth in the league phase are also seeded for the quarter-finals, giving them home advantage in those second legs if they progress. If an unseeded club beat a seeded one, they inherit their seeding position. Our projections, powered by Opta stats, rank Newcastle as the most likely play-off team to progress to the next round. According to Opta, they have a 90 per cent chance of overcoming Qarabag, despite some shaky Premier League form where they have won just once in five matches, losing three and drawing with last-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers. PSG (86 per cent) and Inter (79 per cent), who met in last year's final, are also expected to reach the last 16. And Madrid (60 per cent) are not particularly strong favourites against Benfica three weeks on from that jaw-dropping defeat in Lisbon, when a win would have secured the Spanish side a top-eight finish.
