The actor was charged with two counts after allegedly punching two men and causing chaos at bars

The actor Shia LaBeouf was arrested early on Tuesday for alleged battery in New Orleans after apparently spending the long weekend partying across the city during Mardi Gras.

The New Orleans police department confirmed that at approximately 12.45am on Tuesday officers were called to Faubourg Marigny, located next to the French Quarter, the heart of the revelry, where LaBeouf was allegedly becoming increasingly aggressive at Royal Street Inn and Bar.

Court documents state that the bar manager attempted to escort LaBeouf out of the bar, during which the actor allegedly tried to hit him. Then after being removed, the actor allegedly punched one male patron who was helping the bar manager, before returning and punching a second man in the nose.

LaBeouf was then held down by bystanders until police arrived and he was taken to a hospital. He was later discharged, arrested and charged with two counts of simple battery. 
 He is scheduled to make an initial court appearance on Tuesday afternoon, just as the culmination of New Orleans's weeks-long, annual celebration of carnival hits its climax.

Thousands of people, mostly in various costumes, gathered in and outside Royal Street Inn and Bar later Tuesday. A bartender and a bouncer at the establishment said LeBeouf was not welcome back after his release from custody.

The celebrity gossip outlet TMZ posted a video of LaBeouf, purportedly taken early Tuesday morning, in which he is shirtless and exchanging words with another person. The video then reportedly shows the actor being attended to by paramedics.

Reports of LaBeouf engaging in unruly behavior across New Orleans have surfaced for several days. Robert Skuse, the doorman of Ms Mae's, a local bar, told the Hollywood Reporter the actor showed up in a “somewhat belligerent state”.

“​​In the middle of the mayhem, he did the ‘Do you know who I am?' bit,” Skuse said.

LaBeouf was reportedly asked to leave after trying to get behind the bar and serve drinks to customers.

LaBeouf has previously discussed his struggles with sobriety, crediting fellow actors Mel Gibson, Sean Penn and Josh Brolin for their help. He attended court-mandated rehab after a 2017 arrest in Savannah, Georgia, an experience that inspired his semi-autobiographical film, Honey Boy.

In 2020, FKA twigs, the English singer whose real name is Tahliah Barnett, sued LaBeouf for sexual battery, assault and infliction of emotional distress, alleging a pattern of “relentless” abuse.

In the lawsuit and in an interview with the New York Times, Barnett said LaBeouf, whom she dated from 2018 to 2019 after meeting on the set of Honey Boy, knowingly exposed her to a sexually transmitted infection, attempted to strangle her and slammed her against a car. LaBeouf has denied all allegations of wrongdoing. The pair reached a settlement in July 2025.

LaBeouf's representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

New legislation in several states moves the scope of bathroom bans beyond schools and government buildings.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

In the modern anti-transgender panic, several states have passed laws banning transgender people from restrooms consistent with their gender identity. Early bills focused primarily on K-12 schools, but the scope quickly expanded. Some states extended bans to even private colleges and universities. Others adopted sweeping “government building” prohibitions, barring transgender people from restrooms in all publicly owned facilities — a far broader category than it sounds, encompassing airports, rest stops, and other everyday spaces. A few states went further still, adding punitive enforcement mechanisms; Florida, for example, attached criminal penalties to its ban. Yet one category remained largely untouched: private business bathrooms. That exception is now collapsing. Multiple states are advancing a new generation of bathroom bills that would extend these bans into private businesses for the first time.

The first clear sign that private business bathrooms could be targeted came this year in Kansas. At the end of January, the state passed SB 244 and HB2426 through a rushed “gut-and-go” process designed to bypass portions of public hearings. The legislation drew attention for several reasons, including provisions revoking the driver's licenses of transgender people and forcing them to obtain new ones reflecting their assigned sex at birth. But another provision — first identified by Erin In The Morning and later confirmed by legal and advocacy organizations in Kansas and nationally — was even more alarming. The bill appeared to create a mechanism allowing so-called bathroom bounty hunters to sue transgender people encountered in any restroom, whether in a government-owned building or a private business. With little warning, Kansas had advanced what looked to be the first measure directly threatening transgender people's access to private business bathrooms.

Although the bill was vetoed, Republicans hold enough seats in the Kansas Legislature to potentially override that veto. If they do, the measure would take effect quickly. Transgender Kansans would not only be forced to scramble for updated identification documents reflecting their assigned sex at birth, but would also have to navigate daily life by mapping trips around the availability of gender-neutral bathrooms. Any transgender person who simply continues using the restroom they have always used could face lawsuits seeking substantial damages from individuals eager to weaponize the law for harassment — or profit.

Now, it appears these kinds of bills are spreading. In Idaho, a separate measure — House Bill 607 — has just passed the House and is headed for the state's Senate for consideration. The bill similarly targets transgender people's access to private business bathrooms. The bill would allow lawsuits against any “place of public accommodation” that permits transgender people to use restrooms consistent with their gender identity. While it does not include the criminal penalties or explicit bounty-style provisions seen elsewhere, its practical effect would be sweeping: private businesses across the state could face legal risk simply for allowing transgender people to use the restroom. The scope of bathroom bans is no longer confined to schools or government buildings. It is expanding.

Erin In The Morning has identified additional bills in state legislatures across the country. In Indiana, HB 1198 would apply to any public restroom — whether privately owned or government-run — and would establish criminal penalties for anyone who “knowingly or intentionally enters a restroom that is designated to be used” by someone of a different assigned sex at birth. In Missouri, HB 2314 would weaponize the state's Human Rights Act against private businesses that allow transgender people to use restrooms consistent with their gender identity, effectively turning a civil rights law into a tool for restricting transgender rights. And in Idaho, yet another proposal would not only bar private businesses from permitting transgender people to use certain restrooms but would also impose criminal penalties on violators.

It is worth noting that, so far, anti-transgender bathroom bans have had uneven real-world enforcement. In K-12 schools — where administrators wield significant authority — they have been highly effective at policing transgender students. In colleges and public buildings, however, enforcement has been far more sporadic, with only a handful of documented expulsions from restrooms in states like Texas and Florida. But this next wave of legislation could fundamentally alter that balance. By targeting private businesses and imposing civil or criminal liability directly on transgender individuals, these bills move enforcement out of institutional hands and into the realm of lawsuits and vigilantism. And history offers a warning: once a new anti-trans legal strategy gains traction in one state, it rarely stays there.

In the last weeks, we have witnessed an authoritarian assault on communities in Minnesota and across the nation.

Jesse Jackson, civil rights leader, dies aged 84

Jesse Jackson – a life in pictures

US political leaders pay tribute to Jesse Jackson

Former vice-president Kamala Harris has also paid tribute to Jesse Jackson, describing him as “one of America's greatest patriots”.

“He spent his life summoning all of us to fulfil the promise of America and building the coalitions to make that promise real,” she wrote in a post on X, adding that he gave a voice to those who were “removed from power and politics”.

She continued:

He let us know our voices mattered. He instilled in us that we were somebody. And he widened the path for generations to follow in his footsteps and lead. As a young law student, I would drive back and forth from Oakland, where I lived, to San Francisco, where I went to school. I had a bumper sticker in the back window of my car that read: “Jesse Jackson for President.” 

As I would drive across the Bay Bridge, you would not believe how people from every walk of life would give me a thumbs up or honk of support. They were small interactions, but they exemplified Reverend Jackson's life work – lifting up the dignity of working people, building community and coalitions, and strengthening our democracy and nation. 

I was proud to partner with and learn from him on this work throughout my career, and I am so grateful for the time we spent together this January. Reverend Jackson was a selfless leader, mentor, and friend to me and so many others.

Bishop William J Barber II, who co-founded the Poor People's Campaign, recalled Jackson's hope for America's promise as he paid tribute to the late civil rights activist.

“Jesse Jackson was a gift from God and a witness that God exists in the ways he cared for and lifted all people, the way he called forth a rainbow coalition of people to challenge economic and social inequality from the pulpit to a historic presidential run, the way he dared to keep hope alive whenever the nation struggled with being who she says she is and yet ought to be,” said Barber.

He added:

When I was a college student, he was a gift to me as a mentor, and it has been my great privilege to have him walk alongside me through my whole public ministry.

May we all take up his hope for the America that has never yet been but nevertheless must be.

Jackson, who first travelled to South Africa in July 1979, just after Steve Biko's passing, vigorously advocated for American sanctions on the apartheid regime and supported Nelson Mandela's anti-apartheid struggle.

“His campaigns for an end to apartheid included disinvestment from the apartheid economy and challenging the support the regime enjoyed in certain circles and institutions internationally,” President Cyril Ramaphosa said.

“We are deeply indebted to the energy, principled clarity and personal risk with which he supported our struggle and campaigned for freedom and equality in other parts of the world.”

Jackson's impact “can be felt in virtually every aspect of American life,” said Kristen Clarke, a former Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, US Department of Justice during the Joe Biden administration.

“A tireless and extraordinary public servant, his charge to all of us was to stay hopeful, keep up the good fight and respect the dignity and humanity of all people,” Clarke said in a statement on Tuesday.

“Jackson has been, and will always be, a central part of the story regarding America's ongoing quest for justice and equality.”

During Black History Month in the early 1970s, Jesse Jackson, the civil rights icon who died Tuesday, appeared on the set of the public television show, Sesame Street. Reciting the poem “I Am Somebody”, which was meant to bolster the self esteem of underserved children in urban environments, Jackson led a group of multiracial children on the show in a call and response:

“I am somebody. I am somebody. I may be poor, but I am somebody. I may be young, but I am somebody. I may be on welfare, but I am somebody. I may be small, but I am somebody. I may have made mistakes, but I am somebody. My clothes are different, my face is different, my hair is different, but I am somebody. I am Black, brown, white, I speak a different language, but I must be respected, protected, never rejected. I am God's child. I am somebody.”

Jackson's version of the 1940s poem, originally written by Atlanta minister and civil rights leader Reverend Dr. William Holmes Borders, would become a popular refrain in Black households after its airing on Sesame Street that year.

“I Am Somebody” also served as a rallying call for Jackson throughout his life. In August 2021, he chanted the words with protesters as he advocated for voting rights outside of the US Capitol.

Political leaders have celebrated Jesse Jackson as a “titan” of the civil rights movement after the announcement on Tuesday of his death at the age of 84.

Al Sharpton, the veteran civil rights campaigner who Jackson worked closely with after the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr, called his friend and mentor “a consequential and transformative leader who changed this nation and the world”.

In a social media post on Tuesday, Sharpton wrote: “He shaped public policy and changed laws. He kept the dream alive and taught young children from broken homes, like me, that we don't have broken spirits.”

Senior Democrats, the party for which Jackson campaigned twice as a presidential candidate, in 1984 and 1988, were also quick to pay tribute.

Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign, praised Jackson for embodying “courage, hope, and a relentlessness that will not be denied.”

“His historic presidential campaigns paved the way for generations of Black leaders to imagine ourselves in rooms we were once told were closed to us,” Robinson said in a statement.

“Reverend Jackson also stood up when it mattered; when it wasn't easy and when it wasn't popular. His support for marriage equality and for LGBTQ+ people affirmed a simple, powerful truth: Our liberation is bound together.”

The veteran civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, who has died aged 84, made history when he stood for the White House in 1984 and 1988. He was not the first African American to seek the US presidency, but he was the first to mount a serious challenge, breaking through racial barriers, securing millions of votes and, at one point, becoming frontrunner for the Democratic nomination.

His run opened the way for Barack Obama two decades later. But Jackson deserves to be remembered as more than a footnote in Obama's biography. It took courage and self-confidence to stand in the 1980s, with memories of segregation and the civil rights battles of the 60s still raw.

In the middle of the 1984 presidential run, the writer James Baldwin offered what today still stands as a fitting epitaph. The writer told reporters that the presence of an African-American civil rights activist in the race had been a significant moment.

Jackson's presence “presents the American Republic with questions and choices it has spent all its history until this hour trying to avoid ... And nothing will ever again be what it was before.” The quote came from Marshall Frady's sympathetic biography, Jesse: The Life and Pilgrimage of Jesse Jackson, published in 1996.

“Jackson was more than a civil rights advocate – he was a living bridge between generations, carrying forward the unfinished work and sacred promise of the Civil Rights Movement,” Martin Luther King III and his wife Andrea King said in a statement.

The pair added:

He walked with courage when the road was uncertain, spoke with conviction when the truth was inconvenient, and stood with the poor, the marginalized, and the forgotten when it was not popular to do so.

His life was a testament to the power of faith in action – faith that justice could be won, that dignity belongs to every person, and that love must always have the final word.

May his memory be a wellspring of strength and courage for all who continue the sacred work to which he gave his life. As he so often reminded us: keep hope alive.

A statement on behalf of National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) chairman, Leon W Russell, vice-chair, Karen Boykin Towns and the organisation's president, Derrick Johnson paid tribute to Jackson today.

It read:

Reverend Jesse Jackson was not only a civil rights icon - he was family to the NAACP. His work advanced black America at every turn. He challenged this nation to live up to its highest ideals, and he reminded our movement that hope is both a strategy and a responsibility.

His historic run for president inspired millions and brought race to the forefront of American politics.

We honor his legacy by continuing the work he championed: protecting the right to vote, expanding economic opportunity, and fighting for the freedom and dignity of black people everywhere.

The mayor of Atlanta said in a statement that he intends to keep Jackson's hopes alive, as he paid tribute to the late civil rights activist.

“I join the people of Atlanta mourning the passing of an American icon,” mayor Andre Dickens said.

“Rev Jackson showed up for us consistently. He never stopped challenging leaders to do better by Americans, especially when it comes to economic justice. And that's a fight that we will continue.

“Here in Atlanta, as well as around the country, we would be wise to heed Rev. Jackson's words and ‘keep hope alive.' We intend to.”

Senator Elizabeth Warren said Jesse Jackson was a “trailblazer and a fighter” in an X post today.

She said:

I had the privilege of speaking with him about his vision for a fairer, more equal and just country.

He has given a generation of leaders hope that we can and should keep fighting for that vision.

He will be missed.

Here is a video obituary, detailing the remarkable life of the civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, who died today:

Minority leader of the Senate Chuck Schumer has called Jesse Jackson an “icon” and “fearless warrior” for justice.

In a post on X, he said:

Jesse Jackson was an icon of the civil rights movement and a fearless warrior for justice for all people. He was one of the most powerful forces for positive change in our country and our world. America is a more equal and just place thanks to his work.

My prayers are with his family and all of those who were inspired by him. As we honor Rev. Jackson in the coming days, I will be thinking of the many lessons he taught us: “Never look down on anybody unless you're helping them up.” We should all seek to embody that spirit and serve others the way Rev. Jackson did.

Keep hope—alive!

By the early 1980s, the Democratic party was facing a crossroads. The 1980 landslide election of Ronald Reagan, who clenched the presidency with a whopping 489 electoral college votes against Democratic incumbent Jimmy Carter, swiftly pulled the Democratic party to the right in the political and cultural wave of the “Reagan Revolution”.

For those Democratic constituents left behind, however, a challenge was mounting, mostly within US industrial cities whose economies were ransacked by Reagan's “trickle-down” economics. Record tax cuts for the wealthy had come at the expense of a contracted social safety net, thus exacerbating inequality and collapsing much of the working class into the poor.

Grassroots resistance campaigns spawned across the country in response to this dire urban crisis that had disproportionately devastated African Americans, and between 1982 and 1984 they had registered 2 million new Black voters – the largest gain in registered Black voters since the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

These hands-on voter registration drives were orchestrated much in part by Rev Jesse Jackson, the nationally known civil rights activist who died on Tuesday. Jackson had cut his teeth as one of Martin Luther King Jr's youngest and most charismatic lieutenants in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and throughout the civil rights movement.

By the 1970s, in the wake of King's assassination, Jackson had transferred the movement's master-classes in strategic organizing into founding Operation Push, a populist leftist offshoot of the SCLC that coalesced progressive whites, LGBTQ+ communities, environmentalists, Asian Americans, Indigenous Nations, Latinos, anti-war activists, and labor unions.

Jackson led discussions with leadership across the country about the prospect for a national Black-backed progressive movement that could map a viable path to a Democratic nomination for president.

Former president Joe Biden has paid tribute to Jesse Jackson and said the civil rights activist was “determined and tenacious” in his belief in America's promise.

He said the late civil rights activist was a man of God, as well as a man of the people and that he was “unafraid to work to redeem the soul of our nation”.

In a statement on social media, Biden said:

I've seen how Reverend Jackson has helped lead our Nation forward through tumult and triumph. He's done it with optimism, and a relentless insistence on what is right and just. Whether through impassioned words on the campaign trail, or moments of quiet courage, Reverend Jackson influenced generations of Americans, and countless elected leaders, including Presidents.

Reverend Jackson believed in his bones the promise of America: that we are all created equal in the image of God and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. While we've never fully lived up to that promise, he dedicated his life to ensuring we never fully walked away from it either.

Jill and I are grateful to Reverend Jackson for his lifetime of dedicated service and inspirational leadership. We extend our love to the entire Jackson family, the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, and all those who counted Reverend Jackson as a mentor, friend, and hero.

Govenor JB Pritzker has ordered flags to half-staff across Illinois in honor of Jesse Jackson.

Pritzker, a Democrat, called Jackson a “giant of the civil rights movement.”

“He broke down barriers, inspired generations, and kept hope alive,” Pritzker said in social media posts.

“Our state, nation, and world are better due to his years of service.”

Chairman of the Democrats Ken Martin described Jesse Jackson as “a tireless champion for justice, equality, and human dignity”.

In a post on X, he said:

We mourn the passing of civil rights legend Jesse Jackson, a tireless champion for justice, equality, and human dignity.

Rev. Jackson's lifelong fight for civil rights helped shape a more just America, and his historic 1988 campaign for President broke barriers and inspired millions.

May his legacy continue to guide us forward.

California representative Ro Khanna said Jesse Jackson was a “giant of our times” as he paid tribute to the civil rights activist.

“Reverend Jackson spoke for all those who the powerful do not see. He inspired us to build a rainbow coalition,” he wrote on X.

“His 1988 Convention speech is one of the greatest in our nation's history. He was a giant of our times.”

Former vice-president Kamala Harris has also paid tribute to Jesse Jackson, describing him as “one of America's greatest patriots”.

“He spent his life summoning all of us to fulfil the promise of America and building the coalitions to make that promise real,” she wrote in a post on X, adding that he gave a voice to those who were “removed from power and politics”.

She continued:

He let us know our voices mattered. He instilled in us that we were somebody. And he widened the path for generations to follow in his footsteps and lead. As a young law student, I would drive back and forth from Oakland, where I lived, to San Francisco, where I went to school.

By Igor Bederov, cybersecurity expert 

Palantir Technologies has been hacked, according to well-known blogger Kim Dotcom. The company develops software for intelligence and big data analysis. 

Palantir (named after the magical ‘seeing stones' from ‘The Lord of the Rings') doesn't engage in surveillance in the conventional sense using spies, cameras, or bugs. Instead, it develops software that is sold to government agencies, military organizations, and large corporations.

Clients (like the CIA or the German police) upload all their data, and Palantir (its primary platforms are Gotham for military purposes and Foundry for business) then utilizes AI to transform this chaotic information into a coherent picture.

Essentially, it creates a ‘digital twin' of reality, revealing connections that analysts could have never recognized on their own: for example, that a terrorist had called the cousin of someone who recently transferred money to a suspicious account.

The claims about wiretapping Trump and Musk are likely untrue or highly exaggerated. However, there's no doubt that Palantir serves as a massive surveillance mechanism for monitoring America's adversaries (and not only). It is an “operating system for war and intelligence,” providing agencies with a supercomputer that can see everything. But it's the agencies themselves that feed this computer with data.

Even if the hack is a hoax or only partially true, such a sensational story benefits various parties. It tarnishes the reputations of both Palantir and the CIA. The company was already at odds with human rights activists globally. In Europe, particularly in Germany and Switzerland, there's growing hesitation to purchase the software out of fear that sensitive data would end up with a US intelligence agency.

Russia and China – which, according to Dotcom, will receive the data – may capitalize on the story. Finally, Kim Dotcom is a longstanding enemy of the American justice system (he faces piracy charges in the US), so any story that casts a shadow on the US establishment is profitable for him.

The most valuable data concerns Palantir's developments for Ukraine. Should any documentation concerning the development of nuclear or biological weapons fall into Moscow's hands, it could provide invaluable insights into Kiev's ability to create a ‘dirty nuclear bomb' or biological agents.

This would eliminate uncertainties and allow for the formulation of preemptive protective measures. Furthermore, disclosing the source codes or AI architecture employed by Israel in Gaza and adapted for use by the Ukrainian army would enable the development of more effective electronic warfare systems capable of deceiving those very algorithms.

            The Department of Homeland Security's top spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, is stepping down, a Trump administration official told CNN.
    


            McLaughlin is expected to leave her position as assistant secretary next week.
    


            Her departure comes on the heels of high-profile shootings in Minnesota, where conflicting accounts called into question the department's credibility. McLaughlin was one of the agency's most vocal — and, apart from Secretary Kristi Noem, most visible — defenders, making appearances across news networks to defend President Donald Trump's mass deportation agenda and taking to social media to blast reporting on the agency.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment.
    


            McLaughlin started to plan her departure in December but stayed in the aftermath of the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis, according to a source familiar. Her plans to leave the administration were first reported by Politico.
    


            Even before the killings of Pretti and Good last month, DHS' public affairs office faced questions about its credibility after several incidents in which McLaughlin and the agency made claims that were later undermined by video or statements from local officials.
    


            The agency's credibility issues, combined with its officers' use of aggressive tactics to carry out Trump's deportation mandate, have led to a drop in public opinion on DHS and its components. A recent Ipsos poll showed that 62% of Americans think Immigration and Customs Enforcement's efforts have gone “too far.”
    


            The agency's conduct is a central sticking point in the partial government shutdown that began last week after Congress hit an impasse to negotiate reforms in DHS' immigration operations.
    


            During the first Trump administration, McLaughlin worked as the chief of staff for nuclear arms control at the State Department and in the public affairs office at the Treasury Department.
    


            She went on to work as a spokesperson for Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, and later, for Vivek Ramaswamy's 2024 presidential campaign.
    


            McLaughlin came under scrutiny last year after ProPublica reported that a firm run by her husband was subcontracted to produce an advertising campaign for DHS in a $200 million deal.
    


            McLaughlin told ProPublica at the time that DHS had no visibility into which subcontractors were selected and that she recused herself because of the conflict of interest.
    


            She is the latest top DHS official to leave about a year into the new administration. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Deputy Director Madison Sheahan announced last month she would also step down from her position to run for Congress in her native Ohio.

The congressman from Florida is facing backlash after he said he would choose dogs over Muslims.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

Critics are demanding the censure and even expulsion of a Republican US congressman after his latest bigoted remarks against Muslims.

The firestorm began on Sunday when Rep. Randy Fine (R-Fla.) responded to a sarcastic social media post by Palestinian American activist Nerdeen Kiswani, who jokingly suggested that New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani's election meant that “NYC is coming to Islam,” and it was time to consider banning dogs as pets because “like we've said all along, they are unclean.”

“If they force us to choose,” Fine wrote, “the choice between dogs and Muslims is not a difficult one.”

Kiswani insisted that her post was not meant to be taken at all seriously, and was rather her attempt to satirize some Americans' fears about having a Muslim elected to lead the largest US city.

“If Americans cared as much about abused children as they do about posts joking about dogs,” she wrote, “we might actually be facing a national reckoning. Instead watching some of the same politicians who resisted transparency around the Epstein files discover their outrage over this is telling.”

Many Democratic lawmakers were quick to condemn Fine for suggesting that the US expel Muslims.

“We must call this what it is. Disgusting bigotry,” wrote Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.). “Fine must be censured. It's about morality and decency, not politics.”

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) joined Khanna's call to censure Fine.

“This is genuinely one of the most disgusting statements I have ever seen issued by an American official,” she wrote. “It should not stop shocking us that the Republican Party openly embraces this. Fine should be censured and stripped of committees. To ignore this is to accept and normalize it.”

Rep. Rob Menendez (D-NJ) argued that Fine's statement “is what it looks like when Islamophobia and outrage are the only two items on your political agenda,” and demanded that House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) issue a formal condemnation.

Jennifer Jenkins, a Democrat running against Fine in Florida's 6th Congressional District, said that censuring the Republican lawmaker was not enough.

“Randy Fine has spent years spewing hate: attacking entire faiths, calling for violence, targeting kids and families, and dehumanizing Americans,” she wrote. “He's only escalated. Congress must act now and expel Randy Fine immediately.”

Fine appears undeterred by the condemnation he's received, appearing on Newsmax Tuesday morning to push false claims about Democrats wanting to ban pet dogs.

“People should know Democrats like [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] are saying ‘we are going to get rid of your dogs,'” Fine falsely claimed. “Americans need to keep that in mind when they go and vote in November.”

In the last weeks, we have witnessed an authoritarian assault on communities in Minnesota and across the nation.

The need for truthful, grassroots reporting is urgent at this cataclysmic historical moment. Yet, Trump-aligned billionaires and other allies have taken over many legacy media outlets — the culmination of a decades-long campaign to place control of the narrative into the hands of the political right.

We refuse to let Trump's blatant propaganda machine go unchecked. Untethered to corporate ownership or advertisers, Truthout remains fearless in our reporting and our determination to use journalism as a tool for justice.

            Stephen Colbert taped a “Late Show” interview with James Talarico, a candidate in the Democratic Senate primary in Texas, on Monday. But CBS lawyers intervened before the interview could air on TV.
    


            “We were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,” Colbert told his viewers Monday night.
    


            The shocking action seems to be a result of the Trump administration's intensifying pressure against broadcast TV networks.
    


            The FCC, which regulates local stations operated by broadcasters like CBS, recently issued new guidance about an old regulation known as the “equal time” rule.
    


            The rule requires stations to give equal airtime to all legally qualified candidates for public office — if one is featured, his or her rivals have to be given time, too.
    


            There are big exemptions for news coverage, and for the past two decades that exemption has also been thought to apply to late night and daytime talk shows.
    


            But FCC chair Brendan Carr is rejecting that thinking. Last month, he said stations should no longer assume that shows like Colbert's are exempted from the rule.
    


            “If you're fake news, you're not going to qualify for the bona fide news exemption,” Carr said at a press conference in January.
    


            As Carr's use of the phrase “fake news” indicates, he is a staunch ally of President Trump. He has been harshly critical of talk shows like ABC's “The View” that feature liberal political commentary.
    


            But the FCC's enforcement powers are limited. The lone Democratic commissioner at the FCC, Anna Gomez, said Carr's claims were misleading: “The FCC has not adopted any new regulation, interpretation, or Commission-level policy altering the long-standing news exemption or equal time framework.”
    


            A source at the FCC reiterated that point, saying, “Once again here, the threat is the point.”
    


            “The point is to force shows and networks to second-guess their decisions in light of this ‘new' guidance,” the source told CNN on condition of anonymity.
    


            After Talarico appeared on “The View” earlier this month, Reuters reported that the FCC was opening an investigation into the possible “equal time” violation.
    


            Gomez predicted that no meaningful action would be taken, though, and called it another instance of “government intimidation” against the media.
    


            Colbert's comments on Monday night indicate that he sees the same thing happening.
    


            “Let's just call this what it is,” he said. “Donald Trump's administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV. Because all Trump does is watch TV.”
    


            He also had pointed words for Carr: “Sir, you're chairman of the FCC, so FCC you.”
    


            Colbert's show posted the Talarico interview on YouTube as an “online-only exclusive” since the FCC rules don't apply to streaming.
    


            In the interview, Talarico called out the FCC's conduct, albeit not by name.
    


            Talarico said Republicans “ran against cancel culture, and now they're trying to control what we watch, what we say, what we read. And this is the most dangerous kind of cancel culture, the kind that comes from the top.”
    


            “They went after ‘The View' because I went on there,” Talarico continued. “They went after Jimmy Kimmel for telling a joke they didn't like. They went after you for telling the truth about Paramount's bribe to Donald Trump.”
    


            Last year the previous owners of Paramount paid $16 million to resolve an extraordinary lawsuit filed by Trump over a “60 Minutes” news report he didn't like.
    


            The funds were allocated to Trump's future presidential library, mirroring a settlement agreement that Disney's ABC struck with Trump earlier.
    


            Critics of the settlement described it as a bribe because Paramount was trying to win Trump administration approval for a media mega-merger at the time.
    


            The FCC allowed the merger to move forward just a few weeks after Paramount struck the settlement deal, though Carr insisted the matters were not connected.
    


            CBS and Carr have not responded to CNN's requests for comment about Colbert's on-air assertions Monday night.

DONETSK OBLAST — Walking through the mine-infested field under intense Russian drone surveillance was the scariest part of the mission for 22-year-old infantryman Mykola.

"If you stop, you die," said Mykola, a small-framed soldier with dark circles under his eyes and a tired stare. 

"When we were walking to get to the positions, it wasn't hard to walk — it was hard to realize that you may not walk out alive because there were a lot of our dead around."

The walk to his positions near the eastern town of Myrnohrad was 22 kilometers (about 14 miles). Weather conditions and the intensity of Russian drones dictate the pace. It can take anywhere from a day to two weeks, depending on how often he and his comrades need to take cover from Russian drones. Soldiers and commanders interviewed for this story are not identified by their full names due to security concerns. 

Located merely five kilometers (about three miles) northeast of Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub in Donetsk Oblast, Myrnohrad — once a quiet town — has faced an onslaught of Russian offensives since the fall of 2025.

The Pokrovsk front currently faces the fiercest fighting, with Russia ramping up its offensive in late 2025 to finally capture the city, a highway and railway junction that used to connect the upper parts of Donetsk Oblast with key cities farther west, such as Dnipro. 

Pressuring Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad from the north, east, and the south, Russian troops have gradually closed in on the Ukrainian pocket over the past year, in a slow and costly operation to force Ukraine's withdrawal by cutting off supply routes. 

Russia appears to have either pushed out or eliminated the last small groups of Ukrainian infantrymen clinging to Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, according to Emil Kastehelmi, an analyst at the Finland-based Black Bird Group, which closely analyzes the war using open-source footage. The situation on their outskirts is likely still "relatively messy," but the fight appears to be mostly over, with Russian troops actively trying to consolidate their latest gains, he added. 

"Even though Russians gained these urban areas, the slow fight will most likely continue, without very rapid changes from either side," Kastehelmi told the Kyiv Independent on Feb. 17. 

Independent Ukrainian open-source battlefield monitoring group DeepState has designated Myrnohrad as occupied by Russian forces on its map on Feb. 17. The Ukrainian military has yet to announce the fate of the town.

"It was hard to realize that you may not walk out alive because there were a lot of our dead (guys on the way)."

The reality on the ground is bleak, especially the long walk to the positions, where it is easy to get lost since the commanders have to plan new routes almost every time, soldiers say. 

Mykola is originally from Kherson, a city temporarily occupied by Russia in 2022. He said he tried to enlist as a teenager but was turned away for being too young until last year. 

The 22-year-old, a member of the 38th Marine Brigade, said the learning curve has been steep. Panic can prove fatal in combat. One wrong move could give away the location to Russian drones relentlessly hunting Ukrainian soldiers from above, he said. 

"If one person panics, it could kill the entire group," Mykola said, speaking to the Kyiv Independent near his safe house not far from the front line.

To this day, Mykola doesn't know the fate of six of his friends who lost radio contact in a field while walking back to the rear from their position on New Year's Day. They are considered missing in action (MIA) since their bodies have not been found.

Mykola says his walk to the position during his last mission — which lasted two months until December 2025 — was a nightmare. One of his older comrades was killed, and another was wounded after they could not move quickly enough to evade drones. He took the wounded man to an evacuation point and passed on the coordinates for his fallen comrade. 

"You can only help the wounded at the end," Mykola said, stressing how crucial it is to first prioritize your own survival.

With Russian drones controlling all routes into Myrnohrad, planning routes for troops to enter and exit positions is the most challenging task, according to a deputy battalion commander with the 38th Marine Brigade, who goes by his callsign "Webster." He said he tries to pick foggy days when drones are not able to work effectively, or brief moments when Russia focuses on another part of the front. 

The soldiers are usually given a few possible routes in and out since Russia tends to mine the paths as soon as it sees them being used or destroy them with weapons like artillery and aerial guided bombs (KABs), said Valentyn, a platoon commander from the 25th Air Assault Brigade fighting in Pokrovsk.


"You have to control your emotions, because you could get killed (if you lose control)." 
    

Both sides' expansion of the "kill zone" to about 30 kilometers (about 19 miles) has made it practically impossible to drive up anywhere near the positions, forcing infantrymen to walk each time. With Russian troops advancing, more drones are reaching the rear of Ukraine's last positions in Myrnohrad and Pokrovsk. 

Reaching the positions is only the beginning. Infantrymen have to hold their positions against Russian assaults, one after another. Urban fighting offers both sides shelter in abandoned buildings and houses, where their troops can hide from drones rather than having to try digging dugouts or trenches in winter-hardened ground. 

"There are drones, there are bastards," Mykola said, referring to Russians. "You need to move fast so neither finds you."

Aerial guided bombs (KAB) are the scariest because they can easily zero in on even a multi-story building, leaving soldiers trapped under the rubble, according to soldiers and commanders who spoke to the Kyiv Independent. 

The first thing Mykola had to do after reaching Myrnohrad's outskirts in the fall of 2025 was turn a two-story house into a position. Every move had to be calculated to avoid omnipresent Russian drones from noticing, Mykola recalled. He knew not to touch the house's exterior to keep his position as discreet as possible, but he placed furniture, such as shelves, in front of windows to protect against shrapnel from potential attacks. 

Russian troops often assault in the dark or on foggy days, avoiding daylight when it is incredibly risky to move forward without being spotted, according to the soldiers. 

Fog makes it especially difficult to spot Russian troops occupying a nearby position, according to Mykola. He said a few Russian soldiers were once waiting in an adjacent house just 10 meters away during his last mission, until he noticed an elderly local woman speaking to them, giving away their position. 

"If there is a fog, (Russian troops) sit quietly and wait for others to arrive," Mykola recalled.

Life at the position depended on the number of Russian drones overhead. Mykola said some days he could barely even stick his head out the door, while on other days he could patrol the area and collect essentials, such as food and power banks. 

Knowing which buildings in the Myrnohrad area were still intact or destroyed helped him find cover while patrolling his sector, Mykola said. Even running to thin tree branches, which barely provide cover, is better than doing nothing at all, he explained. 

Russian drones spotted Mykola and his comrade firing at Russian forces at the neighboring house, and they vacated the house immediately. A KAB strike destroyed the house soon after, leaving nothing but ruins, he recalled. 

"You have to control your emotions, because you could get killed if you don't."

There is still “reason to distrust” the company, one security expert said, warning it has backtracked on plans before.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

Ring, the doorbell and security systems company owned by Amazon, announced last week it was canceling its partnership with surveillance company Flock Security following immense backlash to a Super Bowl commercial touting its artificial intelligence (AI) technology.

The integration with Flock was first announced in October. Ring released a statement on February 12 stating that the planned partnership with the company “would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated.”

“We therefore made the joint decision to cancel the integration and continue with our current partners,” Ring added on its website, further stating that the partnership between the two companies “never launched, so no Ring customer videos were ever sent to Flock Safety.

The timing of the announcement, though, came within a week of Ring's controversial Super Bowl ad. 

Within the spot, which aired to an audience of more than 120 million people, Ring touts its AI technology as being able to help find lost dogs using its doorbell cameras. The feel-good advertisement was quickly viewed with skepticism, as people noted that the tech could be used to provide information on humans to police departments or federal agencies, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Indeed, Flock, which sells its surveillance tech to police departments around the country, already sees its dragnet used by federal immigration agents, even at times in violation of the law.The company has helped corporations make “watch lists” against labor and social movement organizers. 

“We already know [Ring has] a form cops can fill out to get access to footage without warrant or permission in an ‘emergency' as determined by them. What will this mean for new features?” surveillance and policing expert Matthew Guariglia explained. 

Importantly, the announcement that the two companies wouldn't integrate with each other doesn't negate the fact that Ring already utilizes biometric identification into its products, including in features like “Familiar Faces.” 

“It doesn't take much to imagine Ring eventually combining these two features: face recognition and neighborhood searches,” read a statement last week from Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a nonprofit group that aims to defend civil liberties and rights of people in the digital world.

Experts are also skeptical that Ring will not try to bring Flock back into its fold sometime in the future. The Amazon-based company partners with other security companies, like Taser and body camera company Axon, through which it runs a program that allows law enforcement access to Ring footage. The program is similar to a prior one run independently by Ring that allowed police to request videos, which was shut down after backlash. 

“Customers of Ring and the bystanders their cameras surveil have reason to distrust the company's assurances” from last week, Dave Maass, director of investigations at EFF, said in an email to Truthout. 

“Ring has a long history of privacy failures and violations that go back years before it announced its partnership with Flock,” Maass added. “Furthermore, surveillance companies like Ring have previously made promises amid public pressure only to backtrack later.”

In the last weeks, we have witnessed an authoritarian assault on communities in Minnesota and across the nation.

Deep strike drones operated by the Security Service of Ukraine successfully hit a large Russian chemicals plant that supplies the country's explosives production, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent.

The attack on the Metafrax Chemicals plant in Perm Krai was carried out overnight between Feb. 16-17 by deep strike specialists from the SBU's Alpha unit, which regularly strikes targets deep inside Russian territory. 

The facility, a home to methanol, urotropine, urea and pentaerythritol production — all precursors for weapons-grade explosives — is under international sanctions, the SBU said.

Local Telegram channels reported explosions heard in the town of Gubakha, which serves the factory.

Perm Krai Governor Dmitry Makhonin confirmed a Ukrainian drone attack in the region but did not provide further details, only reporting that no casualties were recorded.

The facility was already attack by Ukrainian deep strike drones before — on that occasion, belonging to the military intelligence agency HUR — in September 2025.

Gubakha lies around 1,600 kilometers from the nearest Ukrainian-controlled territory, showcasing the growing and consistent reach of Kyiv's deep strike program.

Over the last year, Ukrainian long-range drones operated by the Armed Forces and intelligence agencies have targeted Russian oil infrastructure and military-related industry with increasing frequency and success.

He has previously worked as a managing editor at the online media project Lossi 36, as a freelance journalist and documentary photographer, and at the OSCE and Council of Europe field missions in Albania and Ukraine. 



"Discussions focused on practical issues and the mechanics of possible solutions," Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov said.







The attack on the Metafrax Chemicals plant in Perm Krai was carried out overnight between Feb. 16-17 by deep strike specialists from the SBU's Alpha unit.

Presidential aide Nikolai Patrushev called the European raids on shadow fleet ships "piracy," and expressed concern that the next step would be a full-fledged blockade.

The most difficult period was October, when Russia struck the company 25 times and took out nearly 60% of Ukraine's gas production.

The Ilsky oil refinery in Krasnodar Krai, which supplies fuel to Russian troops, processes 6.42 million tons of oil annually, according to Ukraine's General Staff. 

DTEK has set aside 150 million euros from its own pockets, but needs help from partners to close the rest by the end of the year.

The civilian car was struck in the town of Mykolaivka, located east of the city of Sloviansk and only around ten kilometers from the front line. 



In Odesa, long-range Russian strikes on infrastructure and residential homes saw three civilians injured, according to regional governor Serhii Lysak. 

The Kyiv Independent's War Crimes Investigations Unit will present a new documentary, “Torture Culture,” exposing the systematic torture of Ukrainian civilians in Russian captivity and highlighting Russia's use of torture throughout history.

The number includes 890 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

            Four students wounded in the shooting at a Georgia high school in September 2024 testified on Tuesday about the harrowing moments they realized they had been shot.
    


            Melany Delira-Castaneda, the first to testify, was 15 and in her ninth grade math class at Apalachee High School when her ear began ringing and she smelled smoke, she testified. She stood up and turned toward the door and saw Colt Gray, then 14, pointing a firearm into the classroom and firing indiscriminately, she said.
    


            “I didn't know I was shot, but I was. My body just told me to hold my arm,” Melany, now 16, said quietly through tears. “I was holding my arm and I hid between a pillar … between (the teacher's) smartboard and my desk.”
    


            After the shooting, police took her into the hallway, and Melany saw two students who had been killed lying on the floor. She ultimately went to the hospital with a gunshot wound in her left shoulder and continues to face emotional challenges.
    


            “I feel like, just seeing what I saw that day just sticks with me, and not being able to trust certain people,” she said of the shooting's effect on her.
    


            Melany was one of several teenage shooting victims who testified Tuesday in the trial of Colin Gray, the father of Colt Gray, on charges of murder and manslaughter. Prosecutors allege Colin Gray bought his son the AR-15-style rifle used in the shooting despite previous warnings that his son was a danger to others, actions that constitute criminally reckless conduct.
    


            The trial began Monday with opening statements and testimony from teachers, police and parents at the school that day who spoke about the horror of the attack, which left two students and two teachers dead. Nine other people were injured.
    


            Colin Gray has pleaded not guilty to nearly 30 charges, including two counts each of second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. His attorney said in opening statements Monday that Colin Gray was unaware his son was planning the shooting and had taken steps to try to get him help.
    


            “When someone conceals a plan, deceives the people around them, acts independently, the law does not allow us to pretend that the people left behind should've seen through all of it,” Hobbs said.
    


            Colin Gray's trial is part of a broader push to hold more people accountable for a school shooting, including the shooter's parents and responding law enforcement officers.
    


            This case bears close similarities to the trials of James and Jennifer Crumbley, whose then-15-year-old son killed four students in 2021 at his high school in Oxford, Michigan. The Crumbley parents were each convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison. Their son was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
    


            Colin Gray has remained behind bars since his arrest a day after the shooting. If convicted, he faces 10 to 30 years in prison on each murder charge and 1 to 10 years on each manslaughter charge.
    


            Colt Gray ultimately surrendered to police and has admitted to the shooting, according to authorities. Now 16, he has pleaded not guilty to 55 felony counts, including four counts of malice murder. A trial date has not been set.
    


            While the crux of the trial is on what Colin Gray did and didn't do leading up to the shooting, the students' testimony Tuesday laid out its dramatic violence and high emotional stakes.
    

Jurors watched surveillance videos and heard a harrowing 911 call on the first day of testimony in the trial of Colin Gray, who prosecutors say bears responsibility for the deadly 2024 shooting allegedly carried out by his son. Gray has pleaded not guilty to nearly 30 charges in the case.


            In addition to Melany, fellow students Nautica Walton, Taylor Jones and Natalie Griffith testified about the moments they were shot during the attack. They were all in their ninth-grade math class when they said Colt Gray opened fire through the class window.
    


            Nautica said she felt a hot spot on her leg and realized she had been shot, falling in and out of consciousness. First responders cut off her camo shorts to care for her that day, and a photo of the shorts was shown in court.
    


            Because of the shooting, she can't play sports anymore and is “very paranoid” and depressed, she said.
    


            Taylor said she looked at the classroom door and saw a “kid standing there with a gun” whom she had never seen before. She jumped to the floor and soon realized she had been shot in the leg.

            “After I got shot, I turned to my friend Landon and asked him to hold my hand because I was scared,” she said.
    


            She was airlifted to a hospital and has spent months there due to multiple surgeries. She said she can't play volleyball anymore and finds it hard to walk, and she missed an entire school year during her recovery.
    


            Natalie said she was shot in her shoulder and hand. As she was taken out of the classroom to an ambulance, she saw Colt Gray in handcuffs and angrily cursed at him, she said.
    


            “I saw red. I was very mad,” she said. “I remember yelling at him that we were kids.”
    


            The defense declined to cross-examine any of the students.

A grassroots campaign that united patients and providers succeeded in expanding mental health care access. Here's how.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

Access to mental health care is rapidly expanding in Illinois, thanks to a legislative victory won through a grassroots campaign that united patients and health care providers to take on the power of the health insurance industry. As organizers who worked on the campaign, we're excited to share the story of our win with the hope that it will give momentum and inspiration to similar campaigns in other states.

Our recent victory came on December 12, 2025, when Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker signed House Bill 1085 into law, expanding access to mental health care for about 2.5 million people in our state. This bill requires private insurers to pay mental health and substance abuse treatment providers fairly, and more in line with physical health care, so they can afford to accept private insurance, with the goal of ending ghost networks (lists of providers that are not actually available to take patients) and increasing the number of therapists working in Illinois. The win was a result of three years of grassroots organizing by people who have faced barriers to accessing mental health care and therapists who have been exploited by insurance companies.

Our organization, The People's Lobby, decided to work on this campaign because a significant proportion of our members have faced huge problems in accessing quality health care as a result of profiteering by health insurance corporations. Starting in 2023, we joined the People's Action's “Care Over Cost” campaign to connect with other groups across the country organizing for health care justice. After a year of listening to our members, educating our leaders about the barriers to getting quality care, and strategic conversations with state legislators, we decided to join mental health advocates in working to pass HB 1085 as our first campaign to limit the power of health insurance companies and guarantee higher-quality and more affordable care to patients.

Organizing the people who provide care and who need care to tell their stories is essential in creating a sense of urgency in the face of opposition from health insurance corporations.

In the process we learned a few key lessons about what it takes to expand access to health care. First, having credible and hardworking legislative sponsors matters a lot. Second, organizing the people who provide care and who need care to tell their stories is essential in creating a sense of urgency in the face of opposition from health insurance corporations. Third, showing up relentlessly in our state capitol and in local communities helps ensure health care reform remains a priority in the face of other major crises state legislatures may need to address. Lastly, and maybe most importantly, a significant portion of private insurance (about 40 percent in Illinois) is regulated at the state level, and so in states where Democrats hold power, they can, if they choose, make reforms that meaningfully expand access and quality of care.

Health care policy is complicated and the details matter. Lead sponsor Illinois State Rep. Lindsey LaPointe holds a Master of Social Work (MSW), worked for a number of years as a social worker and human service provider, and deeply understands the barriers to care. The legislative sponsors worked with behavioral health policy experts like Heather O'Donnell, formerly of Thresholds, who crafted the language and amendments, relying on data from both Milliman and the Research Triangle Institute which enumerated the disparities in pay between providers of physical and mental health care. State Sen. Karina Villa, the original and long-time senate sponsor of the bill, also holds an MSW and worked as a school social worker prior to becoming a state legislator. Both sponsors met regularly with O'Donnell, The People's Lobby, and other allies to coordinate messaging and lobbying strategies.

The stories of therapists were critical in persuading legislators to act in spite of the opposition from insurance corporations. Legislators were often startled to hear that many of them hadn't received a real raise in a decade, forcing them to stop accepting insurance, take on an unsustainable number of patients leading to burnout, or leave the profession altogether. Furthermore, for many years, insurance corporations required therapists to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), meaning they could not tell anyone how much they are paid or bargain together for livable wages. One therapist, who asked to remain anonymous so as not to violate her NDA, said, “I have been in private practice for 15 years. Over the course of that time, we have seen no significant increases and often decreases in our annual rate change that is set by the insurance companies and for which providers have zero power to negotiate.”

It was equally important that patients played a leadership role in this campaign and frequently told legislators their stories of the barriers to accessing mental health care. These barriers often resulted in people being forced to pay out of pocket, to delay care while searching “ghost networks,” or to simply go without care.

Alysson Light, associate instructional professor at the University of Chicago and a leader with The People's Lobby, struggled to find a therapist for depression related to providing care for her husband following his organ transplant in 2020. In the winter of 2023, she described herself as exhausted and emotionally numb, unable to balance her own wants and needs against the care her husband needed. Light searched her list of in-network providers, but found many were no longer in the network or did not provide services she needed, what advocates call “ghost networks.” Her husband, who happens to work as a therapist, helped her comb through the list. After three months they found just one practice in Chicago that was equipped to provide care and accepted her insurance. In a further testament to the need for HB 1085, Light's spouse continues to provide therapy to patients in Pennsylvania, where they lived before they moved to Chicago, rather than take the financial hit of practicing in Illinois.

To build the team of therapists and patients willing and able to share their stories and lead this campaign, we held seven town halls throughout Chicago and its suburbs. People showed up because they received personal invitations from The People's Lobby's members, or because they heard about the town halls through therapist listservs, emails from The People's Lobby or allied elected officials, or social media. We began these town halls with a bit of education about why people were not able to access mental health services that insurance corporations say they cover, then we broke into small groups to hear from patients and therapists about their struggles to get or provide care. Elected officials were often present to hear their stories.

We also invited people who attended to tell their stories to legislators in other ways. Despite the Illinois state capitol being three hours away from the closest part of the Chicago metro area, therapists and patients made the trip seven times during the last year of the campaign. We organized another 20 visits with legislators in their districts and sent more than 7,000 letters to legislators during the final year of the campaign. This level of activity helped us work closely with Senate President Don Harmon to keep this issue alive during a time when the state legislature was addressing a state budget crisis and working on a bill to save regional public transportation from a $750 million fiscal cliff.

It's also important to note that HB 1085 builds on other recent Illinois health care reforms. Rate review, which takes full effect in 2026, will require insurance corporations to justify rate increases to the Illinois Department of Insurance (DOI). In lobbying against HB 1085, insurance lobbyists claimed they would have to raise premiums in order to increase provider pay, and rate review will give the DOI some ability to assess the veracity of this claim. The Healthcare Protection Act, which passed in 2024, bans high-deductible and low-coverage insurance (known to advocates as “junk insurance”), ends the practice of requiring patients to try less-effective medicine and fail before covering medicine prescribed by their doctors, and requires insurance corporations to pay for proven standards of care rather than allowing them to define their own, among other provisions.

When organizers and elected officials work together to expand access to care and control costs, we build momentum toward Medicare for All.

Even on the heels of resounding defeats in Washington, D.C., Democrats can make real improvements to health care access and then campaign on those improvements in states where they hold power. Almost anyone who has been sick or helped a loved one navigate the health care system has firsthand experience with the ways health insurance corporations consistently delay and deny care. This anger is widely and deeply felt, and people will feel substantive reforms quickly. When organizers and elected officials work together to expand access to care and control costs, we build momentum toward Medicare for All, and convince other elected officials that taking on the power of health insurance corporations is both good policy and good politics.

The story of how grassroots organizers fought to pass this bill is particularly important in this moment, when as many as 17 million Americans will lose health care due to Medicaid work requirements and cuts to Affordable Care Act subsidies that help people pay for insurance on the marketplace.

To justify allowing these subsidies to lapse, President Donald Trump has cynically adopted one critique from the left, complaining about “money sucking insurance companies.” It's true that insurance corporations maximize profits by taking our premiums and routinely denying necessary and lifesaving care, but in the absence of Medicare for All, the solution is regulating private insurance corporations, not abandoning people to whatever predatory plans or rates insurance corporations are willing to offer. In order for people in the U.S. to get the dignified health care they deserve, we need to do so much more than give insurance corporations more money.

Expanding access to corporate insurance doesn't get at the root of the problem. We have to get creative about other policies that improve access and affordability — and if we organize, it's very much within our power to win.

In the last weeks, we have witnessed an authoritarian assault on communities in Minnesota and across the nation.

The need for truthful, grassroots reporting is urgent at this cataclysmic historical moment. Yet, Trump-aligned billionaires and other allies have taken over many legacy media outlets — the culmination of a decades-long campaign to place control of the narrative into the hands of the political right.

Her family was lucky: Her mom and mom's partner worked at the hospital, one of the few places not laying people off. At 18, she got a Rotary Scholarship to Argentina, an experience that led her to question the ideology that “America knows best,” to begin to understand that the meritocracy is a lie, and to become really curious about U.S. foreign policy. Like a lot of Ohioans, Kristi moved to Chicago for a job after college. She spent 20 years doing organizing and communications work.

A shooter unleashed a flurry of bullets during a Rhode Island youth hockey game, killing two people and injuring three others, in an attack that was cut short when a spectator stepped in to help stop the tragedy, authorities said.

Investigators had spoken to nearly 100 witnesses as of Monday evening as they attempt to piece together what happened earlier that afternoon inside the Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket, a few miles outside Providence.

Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves said Monday that the shooter died from an apparent self-inflicted gun wound, though authorities are still investigating.

Goncalves credited an unnamed “good Samaritan” who intervened, bringing the attack “to a swift end.” She did not provide details.

It is not entirely clear what precipitated the shooting, who was targeted or why. The game was livestreamed by LiveBarn, a streaming platform for youth sporting events, whose videos have been shared on social media showing players on the ice as popping sounds are heard. Chaos quickly unfolds as players on benches dive for cover, those on the ice frantically skate toward exits and fans flee their seats.

LiveBarn's social media account has been issuing warnings to those who shared the video that they do not have permission to do so. An e-mail to LiveBarn seeking comment was sent Tuesday.

“It appears that this was a targeted event, that it may be a family dispute,” Goncalves said. Authorities said both people who died were adults but have not released the identities of the victims.

Goncalves identified the shooter as Robert Dorgan, who she said also went by the name Roberta Esposito, who was born in 1969.

Dorgan was an active employee at General Dynamics Bath Iron Works, a ship building in Bath, Maine, that contracts with the U.S. Navy, David Hench, a spokesperson for the shipyard, said Tuesday. Hench did not immediately respond to questions about Dorgan's job title or how long Dorgan worked at the shipyard.

Monday's shooting came nearly two months after Rhode Island was rocked by a shooting at Brown University that left two students dead and wounded nine others, as well as a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor. Authorities later found Claudio Neves Valente, 48, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at a New Hampshire storage facility.

“Our state is grieving again,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said in a statement. “As governor, a parent, and a former coach, my heart breaks for the victims, families, students, and everyone impacted by the devastating shooting at Lynch Arena in Pawtucket.”

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Ukraine, Russia, and the U.S. began a new round of trilateral peace talks in Geneva on Feb. 17, as Washington presses for progress toward a deal before summer. 

The two-day meeting marks the third round of negotiations since January, following earlier sessions that failed to deliver any breakthrough. 

"Security and humanitarian issues are on the agenda," National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov said. "We are working constructively, with focus and without excessive expectations." 

Zelensky has indicated that the most sensitive issues, including territories and control over the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, remained unresolved after the UAE talks. 

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 16 that this round would cover a broader range of issues than the limited set previously discussed in Abu Dhabi.

"This time, we intend to discuss a wider range of issues, including, in fact, the main issues that concern both the territories and everything else related to our demands," he said. 

The trilateral negotiations were formally opened by Swiss Federal Councillor Ignazio Cassis, who welcomed the delegations. The country is hosting the meeting in its traditional role as a neutral facilitator.

"Switzerland is not a party to the negotiations, but actively supports this trilateral approach aimed at promoting de-escalation and the search for lasting peace," a government spokesperson told the Kyiv Independent. 

Just hours before the talks began — despite Kyiv having already agreed to participate — U.S. President Donald Trump publicly urged Ukraine to "come to the table."  "We have big talks. Ukraine better come to the table fast," he told reporters. "That's all I'm telling you. We are in a position where we want them to come."

Peskov told reporters that he did not expect any major developments on the first day, noting that the negotiations were scheduled to continue tomorrow. 

The talks come after a week of pointed criticism from Russian officials, who have suggested that only Ukraine's capitulation would satisfy Moscow's objectives.

In the days before the negotiations, Russia reshuffled its delegation. President Vladimir Putin appointed his aide Vladimir Medinsky to lead the Russian team.

Medinsky previously headed Russia's delegation during direct negotiations in 2025 and during the March–April 2022 talks in Istanbul. Ukrainian officials at the time described him as a "pseudo-historian" and accused him of advancing uncompromising positions. 

During the 2025 talks, he reportedly warned that Russia was prepared to fight indefinitely and threatened additional territorial advances if Kyiv rejected Moscow's demands.

Zelensky acknowledged the change on Feb. 14 with visible skepticism.

"It was a surprise that Russia changed the head of the delegation," he said. "In my opinion, they want to postpone the decision (to make a peace deal). Maybe I'm a bit pessimistic."

Medinsky is joined by Admiral Igor Kostyukov, chief of military intelligence, and Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin, among others.

Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev is also present but is working on a parallel economic track. He may be involved in discussions tied to the so-called "Dmitriev package," a sweeping U.S.-Russia economic proposal that Moscow confirmed last week. 

Ukraine's delegation is participating at a high level. 

The team is led by Umerov and includes Kyrylo Budanov, Zelensky's chief of staff and former military intelligence chief, along with other senior officials.

The U.S. delegation includes Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law. They are expected to be joined by U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and Gen. Alexus G. Grynkewich, commander of U.S. European Command.  

A German government official told the Kyiv Independent that German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's foreign and security policy adviser is also in Geneva. 

Officials from the U.K. and France are present as well and are expected to meet with Ukrainian officials — and possibly U.S. representatives — after the trilateral talks conclude, a source familiar with the matter said.

The Kyiv Independent has learned that these European officials will not participate in direct negotiations with the Russian delegation.

Both Kyiv and Moscow have signaled that the territorial issue will dominate the talks.

Ukraine maintains that freezing current positions offers the most realistic foundation for a ceasefire at this stage. Russia continues to demand that Ukrainian forces withdraw from Donbas as a precondition for any agreement — a non-starter for Kyiv.

The U.S. has floated the idea of establishing a free economic zone in the war-torn region. Zelensky previously said that neither Ukraine nor Russia had shown much enthusiasm for that proposal.

Another unresolved flashpoint is the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Before Russia's full-scale invasion, the plant generated roughly 20% of Ukraine's electricity and remains the largest nuclear power facility in Europe.

Under a U.S.-backed framework, the plant would be jointly operated by Ukraine, the United States, and Russia, with economic benefits shared. Kyiv fears that such an arrangement would effectively legitimize Russia's occupation of the facility.

Energy security more broadly is also expected to surface in Geneva. Russia continues to target Ukraine's energy infrastructure with relentless strikes, and a potential energy ceasefire remains under discussion.

During the Feb. 4–5 talks in Abu Dhabi, the U.S. delegation proposed that both sides once again support Trump's energy de-escalation initiative. 

Ukraine signaled support for the initiative, but Russia did not agree.

The Geneva talks unfold amid public skepticism from Moscow about the broader peace process — a stance that borders on outright rejection.

While trilateral meetings took place in January and February, senior Russian officials openly questioned key elements of the proposed framework.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Feb. 11 effectively dismissed a U.S.-Ukraine 20-point plan that had been expected to form the basis for negotiations.

Lavrov said that ahead of the August summit in Alaska, Witkoff handed Moscow a document outlining key issues "in line with realities on the ground."

He claimed that the sides had identified "approaches based on the U.S. initiative" that "opened a path to peace" and could have formed the basis for a final deal.

"All subsequent versions are the result of an attempt by Zelensky and (Europe) to override the American initiative," Lavrov said. "Now they are waving around some kind of document with 20 points, which no one has given us either officially or unofficially."

Bloomberg earlier reported that the plan was delivered to Putin in early January, with Witkoff and Kushner later visiting Moscow to discuss it directly with Putin.

Lavrov also warned against what he described as an "enthusiastic perception" of the negotiations on Feb. 10, stressing that "there is still a long way to go."

His remarks reinforce a broader pattern: while Russia continues to participate in talks, it publicly signals that its baseline demands — including territorial concessions and broader political conditions — remain unchanged.

The Geneva meeting is expected to test whether the sides can bridge their competing versions of the plan, with territorial issues to top the agenda.

When Russia announced a "partial" mobilization in the fall of 2022, its society experienced a genuine shock.

The queues at the Upper Lars border crossing into Georgia and the chaotic roundups of reservists are still fresh in public memory. The Russian authorities learned from that episode and shifted tactics toward a more concealed form of mobilization.

Several tools were deployed at once: mass recruitment from prisons, sending convicts to the front in exchange for pardons, and aggressive enlistment of "volunteers" through generous financial incentives — large signing bonuses, debt write-offs, promises of high salaries and a "better life," albeit often a short one.

This approach worked pretty well. Despite brutal "meat-grinder assault" tactics and heavy casualties, Russia's war machine managed to recruit at least as many people as it lost on the battlefield.

Between 2023 and 2025, Russia recruited more than 400,000 people annually for the war against Ukraine. That number has been sufficient to sustain offensive operations, even if not enough to give the Kremlin the decisive advantage needed for rapid advances and large-scale occupation.

If Moscow wants to maintain its current pace of offensive operations, it will need roughly the same number of recruits in 2026. Fewer volunteers would force a reduction in assault intensity. More would allow the army to continue fighting with little regard for casualties.

The short answer is yes. Russia can announce another "partial" mobilization — selective, random, semi-coercive, whatever term it chooses — and pull hundreds of thousands into the army in a relatively short period.

Over the past four years, the state has prepared for this. New laws have made draft evasion far more difficult, penalties have increased, and digital registries of conscripts have been tightened. Police will not need to chase reservists: draft notices can now be issued electronically, and attempts to avoid them may lead to prison sentences — from which many will ultimately still be sent to war.

So yes, Russia has the capacity to mobilize people for continued aggression.

But the broader answer is more complex. The Kremlin will try to avoid an open mobilization. The lessons of fall 2022 were learned. Even an otherwise passive society experienced shock, and the political risks for the regime were real. A new mobilization might be technically smoother thanks to updated laws and better preparation, but Moscow still prefers not to risk it.

After all, why announce mobilization when, for four years, state propaganda has insisted that Russia is winning and that Ukrainian forces and "foreign mercenaries" are on the verge of collapse? As long as the war remains something seen on television, Russians will continue to support it and avoid openly challenging the regime.

Moreover, participation in the war has become part of a revised social contract: it is acceptable — even encouraged — if it is well paid. Few mourn these "volunteers." There is a tacit understanding that they went to war for money and must bear responsibility for their choice.

Anyone who has spent time on Russian social media over the past three years (hopefully for research purposes) has seen the flood of contract recruitment ads. They are everywhere: banners, targeted posts, regional groups, federal channels. The message is simple: sign a contract with the Russian army.

The offer is generous. Millions of rubles as a signing bonus, additional payments, high monthly salaries, debt forgiveness, and preferential mortgages. For a security guard or shop assistant in a provincial town earning 40–60 thousand rubles a month ($500-800), war looks like a social elevator moving far faster than any civilian career.

Fast money attracts vulnerable groups. The average Russian citizen owes banks about 456,000 rubles ($6,000) — roughly seven times their monthly income. An offer of 210,000 rubles a month ($2,700) in the trenches can look less like a death sentence and more like a chance to pay off a mortgage or escape chronic poverty.

This financial "opportunity" comes with obvious costs. Beyond the risk of death, corruption in the armed forces is widespread, soldiers often have to cover basic unit needs from their own pay, and reports of inhumane treatment by commanders are common. But that is a separate story.

The Kremlin shifted much of the financial burden of recruitment onto regional authorities. Regions were given quotas, and most incentive payments were funded by local budgets. Signing bonuses rose sharply — like the price of bitcoin during a boom. In 2024 and early 2025, regions competed in generosity: Tatarstan, Samara, and the Yamalo-Nenets region offered more than 3 million rubles for signing a contract. Many others followed with payouts of 2–3 million ($26,000-39,000).

By late 2025, the bubble burst. Budget deficits — recorded in 67 regions — forced authorities to drastically cut payments. In Samara, the bonus dropped from 3.6 million rubles to 400,000 (from $47,000 USD to $5,200). Tatarstan followed suit, reducing payouts to the Kremlin's recommended minimum. Similar cuts occurred across much of the country.

This question is central not only for Ukraine's defense forces but also for international partners. Our team analyzed Russia's mobilization potential across demographic, political, and economic dimensions and identified five possible scenarios for 2026.

The most limited scenario would be a continuation of so-called hidden mobilization, amounting to about 200,000 recruits. With reduced regional payments, recruitment will likely fall below previous levels. The Kremlin will try to compensate: pressuring conscripts to sign contracts, offering deals to criminal suspects, expanding reservist training cycles, and finding other ways to quietly fill the ranks. 

A second possibility would involve a renewed partial mobilization, bringing total additional forces to around 400,000. If battlefield losses rise or Moscow sees an opportunity to shift momentum, a new mobilization wave is possible. Digital registries could make it smoother than in 2022, drawing mainly from the provinces without disturbing Moscow and St. Petersburg. Politically risky, but plausible.

A more expansive scenario — around 700,000 personnel — would likely affect major cities and middle-class families, raising social tensions and straining the economy. Possible, but unlikely unless the situation becomes critical.

A large-scale mobilization of one million troops would be demographically feasible but economically and politically destabilizing. It would require a near-total war economy, border closures, rationing, and possibly asset seizures.

Finally, a total mobilization of up to five million people is essentially unrealistic. Maintaining such a force would exceed Russia's entire security budget.

It is often said that time favours Russia because Ukraine's resources are limited. In reality, economic losses are accelerating the pressure on Moscow as well. The Russian state may be emotionally indifferent to casualties, but it is not immune to economic constraints.

Russia enters 2026 with a military budget exceeding 7% of GDP. That is enormous, yet still insufficient to secure victory. Demographically, Russia still has manpower for large mobilization waves. But economic and political vulnerabilities are significant. A new mobilization would test the regime: is it ready to break its implicit social contract and turn a semi-voluntary war into a forced one? And are Russians ready to fight under compulsion rather than for money? These questions may be answered in the coming months.

The worst mistake would be to treat this analysis as grounds for complacency. Today, the only force capable of stopping Russian advances — and the Kremlin's broader ambitions, including toward EU countries — is Ukraine's defense forces, properly armed and supported.

The year 2026 offers a real chance for Ukraine and its Western partners to significantly weaken Russia. But this chance is not guaranteed. Inaction or delay will push the Kremlin to seek new funding sources, geopolitical alliances, and economic arrangements to sustain the war.

            Warner Bros. Discovery wants to hear Paramount's “best and final proposal” for the media company, and is opening a brief window for discussions about a bid, while also moving forward with its Netflix merger and urging shareholders to reject Paramount's current hostile bid.
    


            If that sounds convoluted, that's because it is.
    


            Warner Bros. Discovery, or WBD for short, is worth tens of billions of dollars, and the company's board is trying to ensure it squeezes every possible billion out of its suitors.
    


            So it is reopening talks with Paramount, in pursuit of a higher price, while recognizing that Netflix can and likely will match the price.
    


            Netflix, for its part, is criticizing Paramount aggressively, saying that Paramount's “financing challenges and rapid deleveraging plans pose tremendous risk to the entertainment industry.”
    


            Last December, WBD agreed to sell most of the company, including the Warner Bros. movie studio and HBO, to Netflix. WBD's cable channels, including CNN, are not part of the sale.
    


            The deal with Netflix doubled as a rejection of Paramount. But Paramount CEO David Ellison responded by going directly to shareholders with a $30-per-share offer for all of WBD, including CNN.
    


            That's the offer WBD is officially opposing. On Tuesday morning, WBD said it will hold a special shareholder meeting on March 20 and will recommend voting to approve the Netflix deal, which values the studio and streaming assets at $27.75 per share.
    


            WBD has argued that the sale to Netflix, along with the creation of Discovery Global, a new company housing the cable channels, is the best available option for investors, while calling the Paramount proposal overly risky and likening it to a leveraged buyout.
    


            But there is a big unknown: What is Paramount's “best and final” offer?
    


            In negotiating parlance, that's the most a buyer is willing to pay, and Paramount hasn't shared its answer.
    


            During the initial bidding war for WBD last year, Paramount indicated it was willing to pay more than $30 per share. Last week, according to WBD, a person speaking on Paramount's behalf told a Warner board member that Paramount would agree to pay $31 per share if the two sides held deal talks.
    


            The person left some additional wiggle room by indicating that $31 was not the final offer.
    


            And so, despite having a signed merger agreement, Netflix has granted WBD a limited waiver to talk with Paramount for the next seven days.
    


            “We seek your best and final proposal,” WBD said in a letter to Paramount's board on Tuesday morning.
    


            The rest of the letter, full of financial jargon and legalese, can be translated thusly: It's time to put up or shut up.
    


            Paramount made some moves in WBD's direction last week with an amended proposal that slightly sweetened the takeover terms.
    


            Holding talks with Paramount now might unlock even more cash for a company that was barely trading at $10 per share one year ago, before all the sale talk erupted.
    


            “Throughout the entire process, our sole focus has been on maximizing value and certainty for WBD shareholders,” WBD CEO David Zaslav said in a Tuesday press release.
    


            Referring to Paramount by its stock ticker symbol, he said, “Every step of the way, we have provided PSKY with clear direction on the deficiencies in their offers and opportunities to address them. We are engaging with PSKY now to determine whether they can deliver an actionable, binding proposal that provides superior value and certainty for WBD shareholders through their best and final offer.”
    


            Paramount has already filed a lawsuit over the merger battle, so WBD's latest by-the-book move might also be seen as a legal safeguard.
    


            Warner emphasized on Tuesday that its board has not determined that Paramount's proposal is “reasonably likely to result in a transaction that is superior to the Netflix merger.”
    


            But they're going to talk — so it's not entirely unlikely, either.
    


            “While we are confident that our transaction provides superior value and certainty, we recognize the ongoing distraction for WBD stockholders and the broader entertainment industry caused by PSKY's antics,” Netflix said in a statement Tuesday morning. “Accordingly, we granted WBD a narrow seven-day waiver of certain obligations under our merger agreement to allow them to engage with PSKY to fully and finally resolve this matter.”
    


            Netflix also called out “the foreign funding” supporting Paramount's bid, which comes in large part from the royal families of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi.
    


            The funding “is already raising serious national security concerns,” Netflix said, predicting close scrutiny by regulators in multiple countries.
    


            As Rich Greenfield of Lightshed Partners recently said, “the battle for Warner Bros. will make a great ‘Succession' spinoff series on Netflix” someday.

Trump says everyday Americans deserve a chance to buy higher-risk ‘alternative' investments. Critics say this could lead to big losses for small investors

On a summer day in 2018, Cathy Shubert, then 58, hopped in her Toyota Rav 4 and drove to the Jacksonville, Florida, office of Mario Payne, an investment adviser at the financial services firm Raymond James. She had a lot on her mind. She was not happy with her job at a local bank branch and wanted to see if Payne thought she had saved enough to retire.

“He said what I was retiring with would carry me and everything would be wonderful,” she remembered. “I went home and told my husband, ‘Oh my God, I want you to go meet him.'”

After giving notice she would be leaving her job, Shubert said, she signed the back of her retirement check and handed more than $250,000 over to Payne, who over time put her 401(k) savings into “structured notes”, “leveraged ETFs” and other risky products usually intended for wealthy, sophisticated investors.

By 2024, her attorney said, many of these investments had tanked. More than half of her money was gone.

These are perilous times for small investors like Shubert. Wall Street firms seeking to boost their share of the $48tn in US retirement accounts are salivating at the prospect of selling even more high-risk “alternative investments” to so-called “mom and pop” investors. Retirement accounts are a “pot of gold that all sorts of industry players want to get their hands on”, said Barbara Roper, a former senior adviser at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The potential for big losses and the high fees associated with alternative products can wreck the financial hopes of inexperienced investors with modest amounts of money to put in play, according to former regulators, securities fraud lawyers and investors themselves.

And a growing number of small investors may be at risk in the months and the years to come – thanks to a push by the financial industry, federal lawmakers and the Trump administration to loosen protections for small investors.

In August, Donald Trump issued an executive order that promised his administration will make it easier for Americans to stash cutting-edge investments in their retirement accounts. The order – titled “Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors” – touts “the potential growth and diversification opportunities associated with alternative asset investments”. Americans had $13.9tn in 401(k)s and other employer-based retirement plans at the end of September 2025.

Three months later, Trump commuted the prison sentence of the former GPB Capital Holdings CEO David Gentile, who was found guilty in 2024 for his role in a years-long scheme that involved alternative investments. Investor advocates criticized Trump for freeing Gentile, who was at the center of the $1.6bn fraud that harmed thousands of teachers, nurses and other less experienced investors.

“It's a signal that it is not a priority to protect your mom and pop investors,” said Adam Gana, a lawyer at the Chicago firm Gana Weinstein who has represented hundreds of clients who lost money in private equity deals set up by GPB. “It's unbelievable. People's lives were ruined, ruined by their investments in GPB.”

The White House did not provide detailed answers to questions from the Guardian about the Gentile case or Trump's efforts to open up alternative investments to more Americans.

In an emailed statement, a White House spokesperson said: “The Trump administration is committed to expanding optionality for retail investors. All Americans are, of course, encouraged to appropriately weigh the risks that come with any investment decision, including for traditional equity and debt securities.”

The weakening of protections for small investors and the push to sell them riskier products come at a time when many Americans are worried about inflation and the high cost of living. Buffeted by soaring prices for everything from groceries to electricity, 92% of US retirees fear their assets are being eaten away, according to a survey by the asset manager Schroders. In a poll of 401(k) plan participants by the financial services giant Charles Schwab, 57% cited inflation as a top obstacle to reaching a comfortable retirement.

These concerns can leave small investors vulnerable to come-ons for products that promise high yields and protection from inflation.

“A new inflation hedge has arrived,” boasts MarketX Ventures, which describes itself on its website as a “one-stop shop” for high-growth private tech investment opportunities. It suggests investors diversify into private markets “like the super-rich do”. MarketX's CEO, Cathryn Chen, said in an email that most of her firm's clients were sophisticated, tech-savvy investors, and that less sophisticated investors were given “extra help” and “extra resources” to help them understand her firm's investments and their risks.

Alternative investments – often called “alts” in industry shorthand – include an array of products that don't fall into the plain vanilla categories of stocks, bonds or money markets. Among the most aggressively marketed alts are private placements, which receive less scrutiny from securities regulators and lack the disclosure requirements about risks and financial results that are required for stocks and bonds. Other higher-risk alts include promissory notes, structured products and cryptocurrencies.

At the SEC, officials are all-in on Trump's executive order. In remarks to the agency's investor advisory committee in September, the SEC chairman, Paul S Atkins, said he was “delighted” by Trump's order to increase small investor access to alternative assets.

Yet securities regulators know that rules meant to protect investors already are being broken when advisers pitch alts. In 2022, the SEC's division of examinations issued a risk alert after examining registered investment advisers that manage private funds, flagging problems that included misleading performance and marketing disclosures and failing to conduct reasonable investigations of the investments they were selling.

A 2025 study by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (Finra) showed the public lacks basic understanding of markets – an ominous state of affairs at a time when risky alt products are proliferating. When Finra gave an 11-question financial knowledge quiz to 2,861 investors, the average score was 5.3 – just under 50%. To see if investors could recognize warning signs of a fraudulent investment, Finra asked if they would invest in a product “that promises a guaranteed, risk-free 25% annual return every year for the next 5 years”. Half of the investors said they would.

Michael Bixby, a Florida securities lawyer who represents Shubert and more than 100 other people in two lawsuits tied to Payne's alleged misconduct, said the complexity and murkiness of alts makes it nearly impossible for small investors to understand what they're getting into. When the Guardian asked the lawyer how many of his clients understood the investments they had purchased on Payne's advice, Bixby answered with a precise number.

“None,” he said. “On the structured products, I can barely understand it.”

The Guardian reached Payne by phone, but he hung up after he was asked if he would discuss the questions about investor losses that a reporter had sent him. His regulatory records show that he continues to be licensed with the SEC as a registered investment adviser.

Payne is not named as a defendant in Finra arbitration claims and lawsuits that Bixby has filed against Raymond James, the financial firm where Payne previously worked. But the lawsuits include descriptions of alleged misconduct by Payne during his time at Raymond James and after he was fired by the firm – claiming he misled small investors by telling them that high-risk investments were “safe” and “guaranteed”.

The two suits, filed in state court in Florida, claim Raymond James failed to notify the SEC and Finra about Payne's alleged misconduct, depriving Shubert and other investors of information that could have warned them away from working with him. Raymond James told regulators his termination was related to “failure to meet performance expectations” and not his sales practices, according to Finra records.

Spokespeople and lawyers for Raymond James did not respond to requests for comment from the Guardian. In court filings, Raymond James said it was “misleading” for the plaintiffs to say that it had not properly supervised Payne or that the investments he bought for them were not in their best interests. The company has asked that both cases be dismissed, arguing that the plaintiffs failed to file their suits in a timely manner and that many of them didn't become Payne's clients until after he was fired from Raymond James.

Bixby said Shubert lost money in structured notes while Payne was at Raymond James, but most of her losses with Payne came after he left the firm.

Shubert said she wasn't familiar with the kinds of investments Payne put her in. She tried to read a prospectus associated with one of her investments, but didn't make it through to the end. “There is a lot of stuff in those and, to be honest with you, I didn't understand all that,” she recalled. “I thought ‘It's his job – he knows what he's doing.'”

She is grateful to have another source of income from a family member, but said it was still a significant hit, financially and emotionally. Many nights, she said, she lay in bed asking herself: “Oh my God, I only have this much money left – how many years will this last me?”

Along with the risks of slippery salesmanship and big losses, many alternative assets also carry high fees that can eat into even positive investment gains.

And less regulated “alt” investment deals often carry greater risks for losses and fraud, according to studies led by Craig McCann, an economist and securities expert.

In so-called “Regulation D” offerings, by private companies, hedge funds, private equity funds and others, investors typically pay upfront fees including sales commissions and acquisition costs, according to a 2023 research paper by McCann'sconsulting firm, SLCG. These costs, the paper said, reduce returns and create “perverse incentives and conflicts of interest” between investors and the industry players who are creating, managing and selling investment deals.

In a separate study in 2015, McCann's firm looked at publicly traded REITs – real-estate investment trusts – and alternative REITs that are traded privately. This research found that annual investor returns from private REITs averaged 6.3%, compared with 11.6% in the Vanguard REIT Index Fund of traded REITs. More than half of non-traded REITs' underperformance was due to upfront fees that are mostly pocketed by salespeople, the study said.

Fees can also cut into the returns for private placements, which use financial advisers and others to market company shares directly to investors rather than through public offerings traded on stock exchanges.

Kristian Kraszewski, a Massachusetts securities lawyer, filed an arbitration claim against the brokerage firm Concorde Investment Services in February 2025 alleging that his client was “promised steady returns” from Passco Palm Desert LLC, which offered private investments in residential apartment complexes. His client lost $125,000 of the $132,000 he put in, Kraszewski said in the claim, which he filed with Finra, but the broker made 6% on the sale.

Concorde said in an emailed statement that it couldn't comment on the arbitration, which is pending. But it said that its offering documents “clearly disclosed” that the investment, which was offered in 2019, “involved substantial risk”, adding that real estate projects nationwide were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, market disruptions and interest-rate increases.

The company said it “conducts rigorous due diligence” and that it was continually enhancing its systems, training and oversight.

According to a 2019 private placement document reviewed by the Guardian, 13.4% of Passco's $25m offering was expected to go to brokerage fees and other expenses. Executives at Passco did not respond to emails and a phone message from the Guardian.

These days, Kathleen McCauley won't even indulge in a coffee at Dunkin'. At 69, she mows her own lawn and strains to come up with ideas for no-cost outings when she gets a day with her three grandsons. Her nightmare scenario: that social security might not exist in 10 years.

“I feel like I'm in a financial prison,” she told the Guardian.

It is not the life she had expected after squirreling away $600,000, which she had saved up in the jobs she had worked after finishing high school – delivering Pepperidge Farm cookies and Edy's ice cream to stores and later doing retail sales for Verizon Wireless.

In 2022, McCauley said, she started to think about “how old I was” and realized she needed to “beef up” her 401(k). So she entrusted $450,000 to Vincent Camarda, a financial adviser in Massapequa, New York.

She said Camarda “made it seem like there was no risk” when he suggested she invest in a private equity fund called Windsor Capital Fund. She remembers the chilly fall day when she sat in his office going over her assets and expenses.

“He said: ‘How would you feel if I told you that you could retire right now?'” she recalled. “I felt my eyes welling up with tears.”

Two weeks later, she returned to sign the paperwork – a half-inch stack of documents sprinkled with “sign here” tabs. “I wasn't really given an opportunity to read any of it,” she said.

One of those tabs was attached to Windsor's Private Placement Memorandum, which said she would qualify to invest only if she was an “accredited investor” – a term of art that describes the supposedly sophisticated investors who have a net worth of $1m or $200,000 in annual income. With $600,000 in savings and a modest income, she didn't come close to qualifying, according to a lawsuit McCauley filed against Camarda and others in 2024 in federal court in Brooklyn.

“I couldn't even tell you what an accredited investor is,” McCauley said.

The fund began to default on its monthly payments to her in early 2024, but when she demanded her money back, Camarda refused to return her savings, her lawsuit alleges. The suit accuses Camarda and other defendants of fraud, breach of contract and “unjust enrichment”. In an answer to McCauley's suit, the defendants denied the allegations, including McCauley's claim that Camarda said she had enough money to retire.

Neither Camarda nor his lawyers responded to requests for comment.

McCauley and Shubert are not alone in finding their lives changed after being persuaded to invest retirement savings in alternative financial assets.

One Florida retiree, 66, told the Guardian she started visiting local food banks after losing more than $200,000 at the hands of a broker who put her retirement money in structured notes. “It's so hard,” she said. “Friends say ‘Let's go out to eat.' I say ‘I'm not hungry,' or ‘I already ate.' I've never lived like this.”

An 85-year-old Long Island investor said she lost more than $500,000 in promissory notes that were supposed to yield 12% interest. Her money is gone. “I'm in debt over my head and I just signed up with National Debt Relief,” she said.

A 64-year old Florida woman said she lost “almost everything” after investing more than $500,000 in leveraged ETFs and structured notes.

“It's very gut-wrenching,” she said. “We don't go on trips, we don't do anything. I should be enjoying this part of my life and I'm not.”

In the GPB case, lawyers for the company's CEO, Gentile, argued there was no proof investors lost money as a result of the frauds he was convicted of committing – and that shareholders in a private equity fund at the heart of the case were sophisticated investors.

“You had to be rich to invest in this fund,” one of Gentile's attorneys said during the trial.

The government's attorneys pushed back.

“The victims of the defendant's crimes are hardworking everyday people,” prosecutors said in a sentencing memo. “They include small business owners, farmers, a retired electrician who served in the Vietnam war, teachers and nurses.”

Among them is a married couple who said they raised three children and saved their retirement nest egg by sharecropping, waiting tables and running an auto repair and towing business. “All of the literal blood, sweat and tears we shed to work hard and be successful was taken from us,” one of the spouses wrote in a victim statement.

Another investor wrote: “I was bilked out of $25,000, which may not seem like a lot to some, but at my age it will be very difficult to save up that sum of money again. My wife and I made many sacrifices to save $25,000.”

In a separate lawsuit, New York state authorities alleged that investors' funds were used to cover the costs of private jets, Gentile's 50th birthday party and a $355,000 Ferrari FF driven by Gentile.

Gentile denied the allegations against him. A Trump spokesperson blamed the executive's conviction on the “weaponization of justice” by the Biden administration. Gentile's attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.

Trump's clemency order freed the executive from prison after he had served 12 days of a seven-year sentence – and wiped away any requirement that he pay restitution to the victims.

On Thanksgiving, Trump's pardon czar, Alice Marie Johnson, said on social media that she was “deeply grateful to see David Gentile heading home to his young children”, calling his release an example of “the extraordinary power of second chances”.

There have been protections in place for nearly a century that seek to rein in abusive practices in the marketplace for private securities and other alternative investments.

In the wake of the Wall Street crash of 1929, the federal government passed laws to establish new standards for companies that wished to sell securities to the public. Under the new laws, companies that had large numbers of shareholders and were traded on stock exchanges had to provide detailed information about their risks and finances and issue regular reports. Companies not traded on public stock exchanges were required to provide far less information.

Over time, the SEC has offered more and more exemptions to allow companies to avoid disclosure requirements. In 1982, it issued Regulation D, which expanded the number of companies that could sell private securities and widened the universe of investors who could buy them, designating investors with a net worth of $1m or $200,000 in annual income as “accredited investors”.

In 2012, the Jobs Act further loosened restrictions, increasing the number of shareholders a company had to have before being forced to go public and allowing issuers to pitch their private offerings to more investors.

Roper, the former SEC adviser, said the idea that investors in this financial category don't need protection of federal securities laws is a fiction. “Most accredited investors lack the market power to demand access to information” and “lack the financial sophistication to value those securities”, she said.

Today's deregulatory momentum seeks to tear down even more of the modest safeguards that limit advisers' ability to sell alternative investments.

In December, the House of Representatives passed the Invest Act, a sweeping document that would expand the number of companies that can offer shares without providing audited financial statements, reduce regulations and generally make alternative investments more available to the public.

The proposed legislation complements Trump's August executive order, which asserted that “regulatory overreach” and “lawsuits filed by opportunistic trial lawyers” had stifled innovation and prevented Americans' 401(k) retirement accounts from “achieving the competitive returns and asset diversification necessary to secure a dignified, comfortable retirement”.

Atkins, the SEC chair, said in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal in December that the market's most fundamental purpose was “placing American might in the hands of citizens instead of the regulatory state”. While he endorses the idea of making private markets more accessible to everyday investors, Atkins has frequently said that protections are necessary.

An SEC spokesperson did not respond to detailed questions, but referred the Guardian to a statement by Atkins in September that the markets would need “appropriate guardrails” that “address the important issues and potential pitfalls inherent to this genre of investments”.

Amid these shifts, experts expect sales of alternative investments to the public will soar. The Deloitte Center for Financial Services has projected that retail investors' allocations to private investments will grow from $80bn to $2.4tn by 2030.

Investor advocates worry this growing wave of smaller investors will enjoy fewer of the upsides – and more of the downsides – from alternative investments than sophisticated players.

“If you have a really good investment opportunity and need to raise money, you are probably not going to try to sell to every random truck driver,” said Benjamin Edwards, an associate dean at University of Nevada Las Vegas and expert on corporate governance and consumer protection. “So the firms that are offering these investments to retail investors probably can't find anyone else to buy it.”

Along with the challenges of understanding complex investments, experts say, mom and pop investors usually don't have the background to evaluate the firms and advisers that are peddling these deals.

McCauley's lawsuit says she was not aware when she met her adviser, Camarda, that he had already been sued by the SEC for selling the fraudulent securities of Par Funding, a lending company whose CEO was sentenced to 186 months in prison in March for securities fraud and other crimes. The SEC said in its complaint that, in exchange for Par paying down debt that Camarda's company had taken on, Camarda would solicit investors to buy Par's securities. In court papers, Camarda and his co-defendants denied that charge and denied that they had failed to disclose conflicts of interest to investors. The trial is scheduled for August.

Timothy J Dennin, McCauley's attorney, said everyday investors tend to trust persuasive salespeople who have the trappings of success. “They are either uninclined to investigate such a person or unaware of the tools out there that may raise red flags.”

For investors like McCauley and Shubert, it has never been easy to seek justice – and the obstacles are likely to multiply in the months and years ahead.

Financial firms will not open an account unless a customer agrees in writing to give up the right to sue, which means that investors who lose money in alts must seek justice through Finra arbitration, where hearings take place behind closed doors and litigation documents are not public.

Small investors seeking restitution after losing $50,000 or less in alts often face significant hurdles, according to Nicholas J Guiliano, a lawyer who represents investors in arbitration. It is “exceedingly difficult” to find lawyers for small cases, he said, and investors who press a case in the Finra forum on their own “never fare well” compared with those who have lawyers. On its website, Finra lists arbitration clinics that sometimes are able to represent investors who can't afford lawyers.

Big investors with access to the best lawyers, though, have had recent success in holding financial firms to account – and Wall Street has fought back. Arbitrators at Finra awarded $132m last year to a wealthy family that said it lost $19.5m in alts at the hands of Chuck A Roberts, a former adviser at the financial services firm Stifel Nicolaus.

During hearings in 2024, the investors' lawyer presented a text in which Roberts assured one of the family members: “You send me the $15MM, I will double the whole ball of wax in less than 5 years.”

In another text, the adviser boasted to a colleague that he had just pitched a different customer to buy structured notes. The customer “gladly did this round of notes”, he wrote, adding: “I'm calling and chiseling every motherf**ker.” Roberts's lawyer, Susan Schroeder, declined to comment on his behalf.

Roberts, who has 23 pending customer disputes on his Finra record, was barred from the securities industry in July, after telling Finra that he would not continue to testify in a review of the arbitration complaints against Stifel that revolved around his behavior. Stifel did not respond to a request for comment.

The big award didn't sit well with lawyers at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (Sifma), Wall Street's lobbying group. Referring to “recent extreme outlier punitive damages awards”, Sifma has pressed Finra to make its arbitration process less friendly to investors – urging it to help rein in punitive damages awards, make it easier to dismiss investors' arbitration claims and allow financial firms to take “high dollar” disputes to other arbitration forums, which lack Finra's systems that police unpaid awards.

Sifma did not respond to a request for comment.

In an emailed statement, Richard Berry, an executive vice-president at Finra, said the organization “strives to provide a fair, efficient and effective arbitration forum for all participants”.

In his executive order, Trump's bid for putting more 401(k) money into alts is paired with a call to make it harder for investors to pursue compensation for wrongdoing by employers, advisers and other players that control those plans.

Both Trump and Atkins, the SEC chair, have described their quests to open alternative investments to everyday investors as righting a wrong. In their view, retail investors have been denied the opportunity that wealthier people have to invest in these securities.

This effort comes as the SEC's strongest voice for investor protection has been sidelined. In December, the Senate banking committee declined to move forward with the reappointment of the SEC commissioner Caroline Crenshaw.

With the departure of Crenshaw, the lone Democrat on the agency's governing board, the commission now has a 3-0 Republican lineup – producing what the financial reform group Better Markets calls “a one-party echo chamber” that “lacks a commissioner who is willing to stand up to the financial industry”.

Crenshaw had railed against the latest deregulatory efforts – pointing out that private markets were specifically designed for wealthier, more knowledgeable investors because of their high risk, limited information and hidden fees.

In December – in her last speech as an SEC commissioner – Crenshaw said the financial regulatory environment now resembles “the period prior to the stock market crash in 1929”.

Opening private markets to more mom and pop investors, she predicted, “will come back to bite regulators – but not before Main Street Americans' savings have been looted”.

            Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has accused the Trump administration of a “continuing cover-up” in the way it has handled the release of millions of documents relating to Jeffrey Epstein.
    


            “They are slow-walking it, they are redacting the names of men who are in it, they are stonewalling legitimate requests from members of Congress,” Clinton told the BBC at this weekend's Munich Security Conference in Berlin.
    


            Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has repeatedly defended the Department of Justice's handling of the files, saying it is “committed to transparency” and “is hiding nothing.”
    


            The latest batch of documents released by the DOJ contained several references to Bill Clinton, offering fresh insights into the sometimes-lewd ways the former president's staff communicated with Epstein and his longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell.
    


            Hillary Clinton said she and her husband “have nothing to hide.” Bill Clinton has repeatedly denied wrongdoing related to the late sex offender. Previous document dumps revealed photos of Bill Clinton alongside Epstein and in a hot tub with someone a DOJ official described as a “victim” of Epstein's sexual abuse.
    


            Both Clintons are set to appear for closed-door depositions in the House's Epstein probe later February after months of back-and-forth. They agreed to conditions set by the House Oversight Committee chair only once the chamber was preparing for a vote to hold the couple in contempt for defying a congressional subpoena.
    


            Without referencing this tussle, Clinton said in the BBC interview that aired Tuesday the couple “are more than happy to say what we know, which is very limited and totally unrelated to their behavior or their crimes.”
    


Clintons will appear for depositions in Epstein probe, staving off contempt vote



            “I just want it to be fair, I just want everyone to be treated the same way. That's not true for my husband and me,” she added, repeating her desire to attend public hearings.
    


            “I think everybody should testify who is asked to testify,” she said.
    


            She claimed that scrutiny directed toward her and her husband was being used by the administration to “divert attention from President (Donald) Trump.”
    


            Trump, who is mentioned more than 1,000 times in the documents, eventually encouraged Republicans to vote to release the files late last year after initially resisting an effort to make them public.
    


            “I've been totally exonerated,” Trump told reporters Monday on Air Force One, adding of the Clintons, “They're getting pulled in, that's their problem. We'll have to see what happens.”
    


            Clinton referenced Attorney General Pam Bondi's testimony in front of the House Judiciary Committee last week as one example indicating the administration has “something to hide.”
    


            “(Bondi) refused to answer questions, she diverted attention away from the matters at hand, she refused to look at survivors,” Clinton said.
    


Justice Department lists hundreds of prominent people named in Epstein files in letter to Congress



            Her comments struck a similar tone to those made by her husband's spokesperson in December. The spokesperson, when calling on the DOJ to release all the files, said that “refusal to do so will confirm the widespread suspicion the Department of Justice's actions to date are not about transparency, but about insinuation.”
    


            The DOJ has been heavily criticized by Epstein victims and members of Congress over the department's inconsistent redactions of names and details in the millions of released documents.
    


            Some members of Congress who viewed unredacted versions of the documents later said that the department was protecting powerful men, prompting them to unredact additional names in the files and send Congress a list of “politically exposed persons” on Saturday.

            •  The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a towering civil rights leader whose moral vision and fiery oratory reshaped the Democratic Party and America, has died at age 84. His son, Jesse Jackson Jr., told CNN that his father's greatest contribution was giving light to people “who found themselves in dark places.”



            • President Donald Trump praised him as “a force of nature like few others before him,” while former President Joe Biden hailed Jackson as “Determined and tenacious. Unafraid of the work to redeem the soul of our Nation.”
    


            • In other tributes, civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton described Jackson as his mentor and “a movement unto himself,” while Bernice King posted a photo of Jackson alongside her father, Rev. Martin Luther King Jr, with the words, “Both now ancestors.”



            Barack Obama has just released a statement on Jesse Jackson's death, writing that he is “deeply saddened to hear about the passing of a true giant.”
    


                    “For more than 60 years, Reverend Jackson helped lead some of the most significant movements for change in human history. From organizing boycotts and sit-ins, to registering millions of voters, to advocating for freedom and democracy around the world, he was relentless in his belief that we are all children of God, deserving of dignity and respect,” he said.
                





            Obamas said that he and his wife Michelle were directly inspired by Jackson, writing: “Michelle got her first glimpse of political organizing at the Jacksons' kitchen table when she was a teenager.”
    


            “And in his two historic runs for president, he laid the foundation for my own campaign to the highest office of the land,” Obama added.
    


                    “Michelle and I will always be grateful for Jesse's lifetime of service, and the friendship our families share. We stood on his shoulders. We send our deepest condolences to the Jackson family and everyone in Chicago and beyond who knew and loved him,' he said.
                





            Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, who grew up with Rev. Jesse Jackson, shared a heartfelt statement reminiscing on their childhoods, calling him “one of the most quintessential civil rights leaders.”
    


                    “Our relationship began as students at rival high schools in South Carolina and continued at rival HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) in the South – he at North Carolina A&T State University and me at South Carolina State University,” Clyburn said. “These rivalries forged a friendship that remain constant and mutually beneficial.”
                





            Jackson's “passion to bring together all creeds is a testament to his vision of unity, oneness, and a nation under one accord,” he wrote.
    


            If we all work together we can change history, the South Carolina lawmaker said, noting the initiatives Jackson worked on including Operation Breadbasket, an organization to improve the economic condition of Black communities across the nation, as well as anti-apartheid activism, voter registration, and corporate diversity.
    


                    “It should not be lost on any of us the impact that Reverend Jackson has had on the nation, Black Americans, and movements to encourage civic participation around the world. His vision is his legacy, and his teachings continue to inspire me as I continue the pursuit of justice and equality,” Clyburn said.
                





            Former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. described his father today as a “unique in American history.”
    


                    “He had spirit-energy, and even today, when the President of the United States referred to him as a force of energy and nature, make no mistake about it, Jesse Jackson was unique in American history. And I hope that his legacy lives on a new generation of Americans,” Jackson Jr. said in an emotional interview with Wolf Blitzer and Pamela Brown on CNN's “Situation Room.”
                





            The former Illinois lawmaker was referring to President Donald Trump's statement about the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who died today at age 84.
    


            Jackson Jr. said his father's greatest contribution in his activism was giving light to people “who found themselves in dark places” by spending tangible time with those in the margins of society.  Following the work of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, Jackson “did the best he could to keep that flame alive,” his son added.
    


            “He saw himself as a public servant. He believed in servant leadership. He saw himself as a seminarian. He saw politics as a way to carry out the ministry of feeding the hungry, of clothing the naked, of providing health care … of providing food,” Jackson Jr. said.
    


            Jackson was troubled by rising polarization, his son emphasized. One of Jackson's final communications with Trump was about “spirit, energy” and the “challenge before the President of the United States to bring all Americans together,” Jackson Jr. said, noting that he believed his father's relationship with Trump had the potential to strike a different tone.
    


            “Unfortunately, he was never the recipient of a return phone call from the President of the United States. But it's never too late. It's never too late to do right. My father sincerely believes that,” Jackson Jr. added.
    


            Omega Psi Phi Fraternity honored Jackson, a 1960 spring initiate of the Pi Psi Chapter, through a video tribute posted to Facebook and X. The posts highlighted Jackson's lifelong commitment to the organization.
    


            Jackson “stands as a towering figure in the global struggle for justice and human dignity,” the post said.
    


            The fraternity also praised his work for the marginalized, claiming his impact as “undeniable.”
    


            “With two groundbreaking presidential campaigns, more than forty honorary doctorates, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, his impact is undeniable. Yet his greatest legacy lives in the hope he has carried for the marginalized, the oppressed, and the unheard.”
    


            Bill and Hillary Clinton are the latest US politicians to pay tribute to Rev. Jesse Jackson, remembering him as someone who “championed human dignity and helped create opportunities for countless people to live better lives.”
    


            The former president and secretary of state said they were friends with Jackson for almost 50 years after meeting him in 1977 on the 20th anniversary of Little Rock Central High's integration of nine black students into the then-all-white school.
    


                    “Reverend Jackson never stopped working for a better America with brighter tomorrows,” the Clintons wrote in a statement, adding that “he championed the concerns of Black, Latino, Asian, and lower income white Americans.”
                





            Bill Clinton awarded Jackson the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in 2000.
    


            “Hillary and I loved him very much. Our hearts and prayers go out to Jackie, their children and grandchildren, and all the people across America and around the world who were inspired by his service to humanity.”
    


            Among the tributes pouring in for Rev. Jesse Jackson are messages from several world leaders, who remembered the civil rights leader as a global moral authority.
    


            South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said on social media that Jackson's campaigning against apartheid “was a towering contribution to the global anti-apartheid cause,” adding: “we are deeply indebted to the energy, principled clarity and personal risk with which he supported our struggle and campaigned for freedom and equality in other parts of the world.”
    


                    Ramaphosa added that his country is “sad to bid farewell to a global moral authority who gave voice to struggles within the United States as well as struggles for fundamental human rights and democracy around the world, including our own.”
                





            Kenya's President William Ruto called Jackson a “steadfast voice for justice and human dignity” in a post on X.



                    “Across decades of public life, he challenged the global community to expand opportunity and confront inequality, with courage and moral clarity,” Ruto said, adding that Jackson's “legacy will endure in the causes he advanced and the lives he changed.”
                





            French President Emmanuel Macron, meanwhile, called Jackson's death an “immense loss,” writing on social media that he was “a tireless promoter of civil rights” who “never stopped defending peace, justice and brotherhood.”
    


            Other notable international figures also paid tribute to Jackson, including British Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy, who called him a “pillar of the civil rights movement.”
    


            Nigerian civil rights activist Shehu Sani wrote that Jackson's death marked the “end of an era,” calling him “a trailblazer for civil rights and social justice.”
    


            Jackson's “unwavering dedication to racial equality, justice, freedom and compassion has made a lasting impact on the world,” he said.

            In 1984, Jesse Jackson spoke at Democratic National Convention, arguing that the party should expand it's coalition to represent the “many patches” of American society.
    

In 1984, Jesse Jackson spoke at Democratic National Convention, arguing that the party should expand it's coalition to represent the "many patches" of American society. Jackson died at 84 after a long fight with a neurological disorder.


            In the hours since the announcement of Rev. Jesse Jackson's passing, heartfelt messages of condolences and friendship from prominent US political and civil right figures have been pouring in.
    


            Catch up on what they had to say about the towering civil rights leader here:
    

The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the pioneering civil rights leader and two-time presidential candidate, has died at 84, his family said, leaving behind a legacy that reshaped US politics and expanded the modern movement for racial justice.


            Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson staged campaigns against some of America's biggest companies and Wall Street to increase racial diversity and economic opportunities.
    


            Jackson frequently organized boycotts and economic protests to pressure major companies to hire Black and minority employees and executives, work with Black vendors, and support youth and jobs training programs for minorities.
    


            In 1971, Jackson founded Operation PUSH, an advocacy organization to advance economic development and political action for Black people.
    


            Operation PUSH organized high-profile boycotts during the following decades, including campaigns against Anheuser Busch, Coca-Cola, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Nike. The group secured detailed agreements from many companies to increase Black economic participation.
    


                    “The world of private capital and wealth is very much off limits for us,” Jackson said in a 1997 interview. “At this stage, that is our challenge: to open up the doors and bring down the walls on Wall Street.”
                





            In 2014, Jackson's Rainbow PUSH Coalition targeted the tech industry's lack of diversity. Jackson attended Google and Facebook's shareholder meetings.
    


            Jackson's organization last year joined a boycott of Target after the company rolled back some of its diversity programs.
    


            Bishop William Barber II remembered Rev. Jesse Jackson as “a civil rights leader, a human rights leader (and) a moral leader,” as well as his friend of more than 40 years.
    


            Describing Jackson as a “mighty lion,” Barber told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that the late civil rights activist understood that politics is “about people.”
    


                    “He understood that nonviolence was not not doing something. It was in fact, choosing your weapons. It was choosing the way of love and justice and truth and choosing to confront the system. And he will be remembered as one who was determined,” Barber said.
                





            Barber was arrested alongside Jackson in 2021 during a Capitol Hill protest over voting rights. The pair also participated in other protests, Barber said.
    


            “A few years ago, we walked in Texas for three days. Jesse, though he had some ailments, came and was with us … He was always there,” he said.
    


                    “He'll be remembered for that determination. He'll be remembered for caring about people,” he said, adding, “He'll be remembered as a mighty lion who has helped raise up a whole lot of others.”
                





            Chicago resident Ziff Sistrunk went to the headquarters of Rainbow Push today to pay respects to Rev. Jesse Jackson, saying the civil rights leader helped people such as himself believe “you could be somebody.”
    


                    “Rev. Jackson was the person who told ex-felons, such as myself, 40 years ago that when you come home it's going to be difficult but just tell yourself you are somebody.“The wife, the student who goes through difficulties, Rev. Jackson told us that we were somebody. And guess what we did? We believed it. We actually believed it, people actually believed that you could be somebody,” he said.
                





            “That's what brought me out here this morning,” he added, when interviewed by CNN outside the headquarters of the civil rights organization founded by Jackson.
    


            “Take his words, those simple words, that I am somebody. And if the children in schools, people that are getting shot up, believe in recovery, resilience, just take his simple words, that I am somebody.”
    


            Former President Joe Biden reflected on his decadeslong friendship and collaboration with Rev. Jesse Jackson, regarding him as a “man of God and of the people,” while reminding the public that the drive for equality endures following Jackson's passing.
    


                    “Throughout our decades of friendship and partnership, I've known Reverend Jackson as history will remember him: a man of God and of the people. Determined and tenacious. Unafraid of the work to redeem the soul of our Nation,” Biden said in a statement on X.






            Biden recalled witnessing Jackson's efforts through “tumult and triumph,” with “relentless insistence on what is right and just.” He said Jackson's activism leaves a legacy of fearless influence spanning Americans to presidents.
    


            While Jackson's service was guided by his belief in “the promise of America: that we are all created equal in the image of God and deserve to be treated equally,” Biden noted that the challenge remains to attain that ideal.
    


            “While we've never fully lived up to that promise, he dedicated his life to ensuring we never fully walked away from it either,” Biden said.
    


            Civil rights and personal injury attorney Ben Crump released a statement mourning the life of his longtime friend and mentor.
    


            “Reverend Jackson never stopped pushing America to live up to its promise. He empowered millions to declare, ‘I am somebody,' and expanded the path for leaders of color in politics and public life,” Crump said in a post on X.
    


            He went on to praise Jackson as a figure who shaped him personally while recalling Jackson's march alongside Dr. King as just one of his numerous achievements in pushing for equality.
    


            “Reverend Jackson conceived of a more just and inclusive America, believed in it with unwavering faith, and dedicated his entire life to achieving it –– all while teaching the next generation how to carry the torch forward,” he said in the post.
    


            Crump noted that his legacy will continue through his dedicated service and advancements of the last-half century.
    


            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer hailed Jesse Jackson as a “fearless warrior,” describing him as one of the most prominent figures for change in the world.
    


                    “Jesse Jackson was an icon of the civil rights movement and a fearless warrior for justice for all people. He was one of the most powerful forces for positive change in our country and our world. America is a more equal and just place thanks to his work,” the Democratic leader said in a statement on X.
                





            Schumer offered prayers and recalled lessons of service honoring Jackson's lifelong work. He called upon the public to follow Jackson's footsteps.
    


            Martin Luther King III and his wife Arndrea Waters King called Rev. Jesse Jackson a “living bridge between generations.”
    


            “A towering voice and a devoted servant of justice. Reverend Jackson was more than a civil rights advocate — he was a living bridge between generations, carrying forward the unfinished work and sacred promise of the Civil Rights Movement,” the pair said in a statement.
    


                    Jackson “walked with courage when the road was uncertain, spoke with conviction when the truth was inconvenient, and stood with the poor, the marginalized, and the forgotten when it was not popular to do so,” they continued.
                





            The Kings added that Jackson had faith in the power of action and said that their hearts are with his loved ones, as well as the “countless people whose lives were touched by his ministry and movement.”
    


                    “We honor his extraordinary legacy and lifelong devotion to civil rights and human dignity. May his memory be a wellspring of strength and courage for all who continue the sacred work to which he gave his life,” they said.
                





            The Rev. Jesse Jackson was “a lifelong soldier for justice” and “a transformative leader whose life's work is deeply woven into the history, mission, and enduring impact of our Association and the nation,” the NAACP said in a statement honoring his life.
    


            “As a young organizer in the 1960s, he labored alongside NAACP leaders, spoke at several national conventions, marched with our members, and helped expand the national movement for racial equality into a broad, people-powered coalition demanding systemic change,” the association said.
    


            In a joint statement, the leaders of the NAACP continued: “His work advanced Black America at every turn. He challenged this nation to live up to its highest ideals, and he reminded our movement that hope is both a strategy and a responsibility. His historic run for president inspired millions and brought race to the forefront of American politics.”
    


                    “We honor his legacy by continuing the work he championed: protecting the right to vote, expanding economic opportunity, and fighting for the freedom and dignity of Black people everywhere,” said NAACP Chairman Leon W. Russell, Vice Chair Karen Boykin Towns, and President Derrick Johnson.
                





            The NAACP, founded in 1909, advocates and litigates for the civil rights of Black Americans and works to end race-based discrimination.
    


            Former Vice President Kamala Harris wrote a tribute to Jesse Jackson in a social media post this morning, saying Jackson “let us know our voices mattered. He instilled in us that we were somebody.”
    


                    “Reverend Jackson gave a voice to people who were removed from power and politics,” Harris wrote, adding that Jackson “widened the path for generations to follow in his footsteps and lead.”
                





            The former vice president shared an anecdote about receiving many a “thumbs up or honk of support” while driving around with a “Jesse Jackson for President” bumper sticker during her time in law school.
    


                    “I was proud to partner with and learn from him on this work throughout my career, and I am so grateful for the time we spent together this January. Reverend Jackson was a selfless leader, mentor, and friend to me and so many others,” she wrote.
                





            “Today and every day, we will carry forward his call to “Keep hope alive,”” her post concluded.
    


            Andrew Young, a civil rights leader and former US ambassador to the United Nations, remembered his friend Rev. Jesse Jackson as “always trying to look out for other people.”
    


            Speaking with CNN, Young recounted meeting Jackson for the first time in Selma, Alabama, during a protest.
    


            “Jesse Jackson and I met in Selma. He was still a student,” Young said. People were backed up in a church because the police had pushed them there, according to Young who said, “to keep people from being hurt, I was standing there and I'd been there all day.”
    


                    “He came up to me that night and he said, ‘Look, I can hold this place for you. You really need to go get some sleep.,'” Young said. “I was very grateful. And from then on he was always a young man looking at how he could help somebody.”
                





            After the encounter that night, Young said he talked to Martin Luther King Jr. about Jackson.  “‘I met a young man last night, he's from Chicago. When we go there we need to look him up.'” Young said he told King. “But (Jackson) looked us up.”
    


            Jackson and Young became “good friends” according to the ambassador.
    


            President Donald Trump acknowledged the passing of civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, whom he called “a good man” and “a force of nature like few others before him.”
    


                    “I knew him well, long before becoming President. He was a good man, with lots of personality, grit, and ‘street smarts.' He was very gregarious - Someone who truly loved people!” Trump posted on Truth Social.
                





            Trump also used his history with Jackson and his Rainbow Coalition to defend his character after the president was recently criticized for posting (and then deleting) a racist video.
    


            “Despite the fact that I am falsely and consistently called a Racist by the Scoundrels and Lunatics on the Radical Left, Democrats ALL, it was always my pleasure to help Jesse along the way,” Trump said. He ended the lengthy social media post with condolences to the Jackson family.
    


            “He loved his family greatly, and to them I send my deepest sympathies and condolences. Jesse will be missed!” Trump said.
    


            Back in 1999, Jackson praised Trump, then a real estate developer, at the Rainbow PUSH Coalition Wall St. Project Conference, saying Trump gave them space for the Wall St. project.
    


            However, during Trump's campaign for president in 2016, when he was promoting the idea that then-President Barack Obama was not born in the United States, Jackson criticized Trump, telling Bloomberg Television, Trump “saw a lie as a victory.”
    


            Republican South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, GOP Senator Tim Scott and GOP Senator Lindsey Graham posted statements paying tribute to Jesse Jackson's life following his passing. Jackson was born in Greenville, South Carolina in 1941 to a cotton grader and hairdresser.
    


McMaster announced that he will lower the flags over the state capitol in Columbia, South Carolina, to honor Jackson's memory and legacy. He described Jackson as an “icon” in the civil rights movement.
    


            “A native son of South Carolina, and an icon of the civil rights movement, the Reverend Jesse Jackson was a prominent voice in our nation's political and cultural dialogue. Peggy and I are saddened to learn of his passing,” McMaster said.
    


            Senator Graham offered condolences while commending Jackson as a “larger-than-life figure,” working “to make America live up to its potential.”
    


            “I am sorry to hear of the passing of Reverend Jesse Jackson, a native of South Carolina. He was a larger-than-life figure who passionately pushed for his causes, always striving to make America live up to its potential. He led a long and consequential life, and he will be missed by his family and friends,” Graham wrote on X. “May he Rest in Peace.”
    


            And Sen. Scott expressed his respect for the late civil rights leader, saying “I don't have to agree with someone politically to deeply respect the role Jesse Jackson, a South Carolina native, played in uplifting Black voices and inspiring young folks to believe their voices mattered.”
    


            “Those that empower people to stand taller always leave a lasting mark. Rest in peace,” the South Carolina lawmaker wrote in a post on X.



The post was updated with Sen. Tim Scott's statement.

Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.

After NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said last weekend that tanking is the worst it's been "in recent memory," Mark Cuban believes he and the league office should "embrace" it.

The NBA recently fined the Utah Jazz and Indiana Pacers, who own a combined record of 33-78, $500,000 and $100,000, respectively, for sitting healthy players, and Silver said last weekend he is considering "every possible remedy" to combat it.

But Cuban, who has admitted to tanking in the past, posted on X "Why the NBA should embrace" teams not putting their best foot forward for future gain.

"The NBA has…been misguided thinking that fans want to see their teams compete every night with a chance to win. It's never been that way," Cuban began in a lengthy X post.

"When I got into the NBA, they thought they were in the basketball business. They aren't. They are in the business of creating experiences for fans. Few can remember the score from the last game they saw or went to. They can't remember the dunks or shots. What they remember is who they were with. Their family, friends, a date. That's what makes the experience special. 

"Fans know their team can't win every game. They know only one team can win a ring. What fan (sic) that care about their team's record want is hope. Hope they will get better and have a chance to compete for the playoffs and then maybe a ring. The one way to get closer to that is via the draft. And trades. And cap room. You have a better chance of improving via all 3, when you tank.

"We didn't tank often. Only a few times over 23 years, but when we did, our fans appreciated it. And it got us to where we could improve, trade up to get Luka [Doncic] and improve our team.

"The NBA should worry more about fan experience than tanking. It should worry more about pricing fans out of games than tanking. You know who cares the least about tanking, a parent who cant afford to bring their 3 kids to a game and buy their kids a jersey of their fave player Tanking isn't the issue. Affordability and quality of game presentation are."

With a stacked NBA Draft class, it appears that more teams are vying for better chances at the No. 1 pick. And while the lottery had good intentions to not guarantee the worst team the best pick, the luck of the draw has led to more and more teams who know they cannot compete for a championship to compete for what they hope will be their next chance at one.

"If teams are manipulating their performance in order to get higher draft picks even in a lottery, then the question becomes ... are they really the worst-performing teams?" Silver said during NBA All-Star Weekend. "It's not clear to me, for example, that the 30th-performing team is that much measurably worse than the 22nd-performing team, particularly if you have incentive to perform poorly to get a better draft pick…

            • Iran talks: While “progress was made” during today's discussions in Geneva, the US expects to receive detailed proposals from the Iranian government in the next two weeks to address gaps between their positions, US officials said. Iran's foreign minister said the two sides agreed on “guiding principles” for talks, but more work is needed.
    


            • Russia-Ukraine talks: Discussions aimed at resolving Russia's war in Ukraine are also taking place in Geneva. They are happening as Ukraine accuses Russia of launching a large combined attack on its energy infrastructure overnight into today.
    


            • Back in Washington: The Department of Homeland Security remains shut down over the bitter policy fight on immigration reforms. Democrats have sent a counteroffer to the White House, a spokesperson for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told CNN.
    


            Talks between Russia and Ukraine have ended between the two sides' political negotiators, a source within Ukraine's delegation told CNN on Tuesday. Military negotiators are still meeting, however.
    


            The source added that both groups will reconvene tomorrow morning, with statements expected from the negotiating parties once talks conclude.
    


            Shortly afterwards, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported that talks had ended after four and a half hours.
    


            The US expects to receive detailed proposals from the Iranian government to address gaps in the positions of the two countries following talks in Geneva today, US officials said.
    


                    “Progress was made, but there are still a lot of details to discuss. The Iranians said they would come back in the next two weeks with detailed proposals to address some of the open gaps in our positions,” one US official said.
                





            The readout appeared positive, but it comes as the US military continues to build up its posture in the Middle East. President Donald Trump has warned Iran of a “very traumatic” outcome if they don't agree to a deal in the coming weeks.
    


            The Iranians have indicated through intermediaries leading up to the talks that they could move some of their uranium stockpiles to Russia and that they would be open to economic deals with the US as part of a new nuclear agreement, but it's unclear if those specific issues came up at the talks on Tuesday, sources said.
    


            The Iranians have also signaled that they would be open to halting enrichment for a period, but have said that a permanent ban on enrichment is unacceptable, sources said.
    


            While his negotiators hash out foreign policy in Geneva, President Donald Trump has three events on his public schedule for this afternoon, none of which are open to press.
    


            We'll let you know if we get any updates.
    


            As talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine proceed in a Geneva hotel, Kyiv's mayor says that over 1,000 residential buildings there still lack heat due to Russian attacks on a power plant.
    


            According to Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko, 1,100 residential buildings in Ukraine's capital lack heat due to “critical damage” sustained at a nearby power plant. Klitchko said that 2,600 buildings have had heat restored after an attack on February 12.
    


            It is currently around 16 degrees Fahrenheit in Kyiv.
    


            Russia has frequently attacked Ukrainian energy infrastructure in recent months, forcing Ukrainian energy workers to improvise new safety procedures to make sure the power stays on. In January, an energy worker showed CNN the sandbag-lined steel capsule he's used to take shelter during dozens of attacks on the power plant where he works.
    


            “It's scary, of course,” Oleksandr Adamenko told CNN. “But we overcome our fears and tell ourselves that we have to stay because of the equipment, first and foremost, to keep people warm. Otherwise, who will do it, if not us?”
    


            After Iran's foreign minister said Tehran and Washington had agreed on “guiding principles” for their negotiations, a leading analyst of Iranian affairs has said this would represent progress, if confirmed by the US side.
    


                    “If at least they can agree on what it is that's on the table that they're going to negotiate about, that is a positive development,” Ali Vaez, the Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, told CNN's Becky Anderson.
                





            Vaez cautioned, however, that the “substance” of the negotiations would take far longer than the “scope.” In the talks that led to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, Vaez said “it took two and a half years to negotiate the substance.” Iran's negotiating position is weaker this time, he said, because its nuclear program was severely damaged by US and Israeli strikes in June.
    


                    “Iran's nuclear program is now in ruins, so things that were not possible in 2015 – for instance, Iran agreeing to completely suspend its uranium enrichment – are now facts on the ground. Iran has not spun a single centrifuge in the past seven, eight months. It has not enriched a single gram of uranium in that period. So some of the concessions are now easier for the Iranians,” he said.
                





            Ultimately, Vaez said the success of the talks would depend on whether both sides tempered their demands.
    


                    “If the parties want a limited and achievable agreement, they're going to have a deal. But if they want to go for overreach, they're going to have a war.”

            Supporters of Ukraine gathered outside the InterContinental hotel in Geneva, Switzerland, on Tuesday — where peace talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US are currently underway.
    


            Some people outside the venue wore Ukrainian flags and held placards with messages in support of Ukraine. In other parts of the city, protesters held up banners reading “STOP KILLING UKRAINIANS!” and “STOP THE WAR NOW.”
    


            As talks on Iran and Ukraine are happening today overseas, here's the latest on the partial government shutdown back in the US.
    


            Democrats last night sent a counteroffer to the White House on Department of Homeland Security reforms they want to see, a spokesperson for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said.
    


            It comes as negotiations to restore funding to DHS have been moving very slowly, and lawmakers are on a weeklong recess.
    


            Ahead of the counteroffer, Trump said yesterday evening aboard Air Force One that he's willing to meet with Democrats to negotiate lapsed DHS funding.
    


            Trump told reporters, “I will, but you know, we have to protect our law enforcement, they've done a great job.”
    


CNN's Donald Judd contributed reporting to this post. 



            Iran and the United States agreed in Geneva on “guiding principles” for talks, but more work needs to be done, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Tuesday.
    


            Tehran's top diplomat said that the indirect talks with US special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner were more “serious” than a previous round held earlier in Oman this month, describing them as “positive” but warning that an agreement will not be reached “quickly.”
    


            “We are hopeful that we can get this work done quickly and we are able to spend time on it. But regardless when it comes to the text the work becomes more detailed and harder,” he told state television after a second round of talks concluded with the US in Geneva.
    


            “We have reached understandings on the guiding principles, but the drafting and writing phase of the agreement will be more difficult,” he said, adding that the date for the next round of talks is yet to be set.
    


            Araghchi said the two sides had agreed to prepare draft texts of an agreement and exchange them before the next round of talks.
    


            “Right now we have a much clearer picture of what work needs to happen and what work needs to continue of course both sides still have work to do to get closer together but at least now we have a framework and a clearer path to go on,” he said.
    


            Today's talks between the US, Ukraine and Russia in Geneva, Switzerland are being led by US President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, on the US side.
    


            Vladimir Medinsky, aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin, is leading the Kremlin delegation.
    


            Meanwhile, Ukraine's delegation is being led by Kyiv's chief negotiator Rustem Umerov.
    


            Umerov said Friday he would be joined by several other officials, including Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine's presidential chief of staff, and Andriy Hnatov, the head of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
    


            These photos have been released by Ukraine's National Defense and Security Council, showing the peace talks now taking place at the InterContinental hotel in Geneva, Switzerland.
    


            The US delegation, led by Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner, can be seen at the head of the table, with the Ukrainian delegation on their left and the Russian delegation to their right. Several small bunches of flowers decorate each table, and three large bouquets sit in the middle of the room.
    


            The flags of all three countries, in addition to the Swiss flag, stand behind the Americans.
    


            A little over a mile separates today's two hubs of diplomacy in Geneva. Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff spent the morning locked in talks with Iranian officials at the Omani consulate, and are now at the InterContinental hotel for negotiations with Russia and Ukraine.
    


            Holding two sets of high-stakes negotiations back-to-back is an unusual diplomatic arrangement, according to a former diplomat.
    


            “It is not unusual for secretaries of state, or other senior officials with a span of responsibilities, to deal with many different issues in a single trip,” Daniel Fried, the former US ambassador to Poland, told CNN. “It is unusual for special envoys or negotiators to be dual-hatted like this.”
    


            Fried, who also served as the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs under former President George W. Bush, warned that problems can mount if overstretched envoys are not backed up by teams of experts. “The combination of dual-hatted people who may not be adequately staffed, and who don't have – it's not their fault – but cannot be expected to have a mastery of the details, could lead to problems,” he said.
    


            Rather than this being an instance of the Trump administration making the most efficient use of its diplomatic resources, Fried said it is clear that the president trusts his son-in-law and special envoy to achieve results more than others in his administration.
    


            “But the bottom line is, you have to judge by the results,” he said. “So far, the results are impressive with respect to the Ukrainians and the Europeans” – in terms of the concessions Washington has been able to exact – “and unimpressive with respect to the Russians, who have given nothing.”
    


            Iran's delegation attending talks with the US in Geneva today will head back to Tehran tonight, an Iranian official told CNN.
    


            The second round of negotiations concluded in the Swiss city a short while ago.
    


            Iran will close parts of the Strait of Hormuz today for what it said were safety reasons as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps conducts naval exercises, according to Iranian media.
    


            The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the exercises – which come as the US is increasing its own military assets in the region – would simulate “real maritime threats.”
    


            Iran's semi-official news agency Fars said the closure would be “for a few hours” in order to “observe safety and navigation protocols” in the strait.
    


            The naval drills come as the US and Iran resume indirect talks in Geneva, Switzerland aimed at resolving their long-running dispute over Iran's nuclear program.
    


             The Strait of Hormuz is located between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, and is the only way to ship crude from the oil-rich Persian Gulf to the rest of the world. Iran controls its northern side.
    


            About 20 million barrels of oil, or one-fifth of daily global production, flow through the strait every day, according to the US Energy Information Administration, which calls the channel a “critical oil chokepoint.” Iranian officials have previously threatened to close the strait in the face of tensions with the West, a scenario that would massively disrupt global shipping.
    


CNN's Anna Chernova contributed reporting.



            Russia launched another series of attacks on Ukraine this morning, local officials said, hours before today's three-way talks aimed at resolving Russia's war in Ukraine began.
    


            Six civilians were injured in a Russian attack on the country's northern Sumy region, with buildings and cars also damaged, according to Oleh Hryhorov, head of the region's military administration.
    


            Meanwhile, at least three people were injured in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson due to the Russian attacks, local authorities said.
    


            A Russian drone attack on a car in Donetsk region, which was transporting employees of a power plant to work, killed three people today, Ukraine's ministry of energy said.
    


            Ukraine said Tuesday it had hit Russia's Ilsky oil refinery – among the largest in the country's south – in an overnight strike. “The target was hit, causing a fire on the premises,” the General Staff of Ukraine said in a statement Tuesday.
    


            Today's talks are the third such round of negotiations seeking to reach a peace deal to end almost four years of war.
    


            Jared Kushner, Donald Trump's son-in-law, and Steve Witkoff, the US president's special envoy, have just wrapped talks with Iranian officials and will soon begin discussions with delegates from Russia and Ukraine.
    


            Last night, Trump told reporters that he would be involved in the talks “indirectly.” Here's the latest:
    


• Iran talks: A second round of US-Iran nuclear talks began this morning in Geneva, Switzerland. The talks are aiming to curb Iran's nuclear program – potentially in exchange for the US lifting sanctions – and reduce tensions between the two countries.
    


• First round: The last round of talks, held in Oman on February 6, marked the first diplomatic engagement between the two sides since the US and Israel struck Iran last summer. Iranian officials said the Oman meeting had been a “good start.”
    


• Iran's demands: Iran has restated that it wants to enrich uranium for civilian purposes, but the US and its allies warn that the regime could use the purified fuel to make a bomb. In exchange for sanctions relief, Iran has offered to place checks on its program to ensure its uranium does not reach weapons-grade purity.
    


• US demands: Not content merely to secure curbs on Iran's nuclear program, the US is also seeking to include Iran's ballistic missiles and its regional proxies – including Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza – in any future agreement. Iran has previously rejected these attempts, and it is not yet clear what progress was made on Tuesday.
    


• Russia-Ukraine talks: This afternoon, Witkoff and Kushner have pivoted to another thorny dispute, taking part in trilateral talks with Russia and Ukraine aimed at ending the nearly four-year war. Those talks are also taking place in Geneva.
    


            Today's talks between Ukraine, Russia and the United States in Geneva have begun, according to Russian state media RIA.
    


            As the talks started, Kyiv's chief negotiator Rustem Umerov thanked the US for its “involvement and consistent work in the negotiation process.”
    


                    “We are working constructively, with focus and without exaggerated expectations. Our task is to advance as much as possible those decisions that can bring about lasting peace,” Umerov said in a statement.
                





            Russia's delegation has arrived at the Hotel Intercontinental in Geneva, where this afternoon's trilateral talks aimed at ending Russia's war in Ukraine are expected to take place, Russian state news agency TASS said.
    


            The delegation – which will be led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky – touched down in Geneva early Tuesday morning, Russian state media said earlier.
    


            The trilateral Russia-Ukraine-US talks are due to last two days.
    


            The second round of indirect negotiations between the United States and Iran in Geneva, Switzerland, has ended, Iran's semi-official Students' News Agency (ISNA) reported, adding that delegations from both sides have left the venue.
    


            While we await news from the talks taking place between the US and Iran in Geneva today, let's look at reaction to what's happening on the ground in Iran.
    


            The son of the country's last shah called Sunday for “humanitarian intervention” by the US following a brutal crackdown on protests against the regime, as President Donald Trump considers military strikes on the country.
    


            Reza Pahlavi said the Iranian people want “freedom,” and he urged the world to increase pressure on the regime. He spoke a day after addressing a mass demonstration in Germany, where he was attending the Munich Security Conference.
    


            “As we speak, there are people that are being executed in Iran. There are people that are being arrested and tortured,” Pahlavi told Fox News in an interview.
    


                    “That's why an intervention is so necessary. … This intervention is a humanitarian intervention to save lives that will otherwise also continue to be lost.”
                





            At least 6,490 protesters have been killed in Iran since mass demonstrations erupted in late December, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) reported as of last Wednesday. CNN cannot independently verify HRANA's figures.
    


            “What's happening, this is really on a scale (that is) unimaginable,” said Pahlavi.
    


            Pahlavi, who is based in the US, has sought to position himself as a de facto leader of the protesters who staged the most potent challenge to the Islamic Republic in years. Some chanted his name and held signs bearing his image.
    


            Former negotiators who represented the US and Iran told CNN that despite the tensions, an agreement between the countries remains achievable if the Islamic Republic offers firm guarantees to suspend its nuclear program.
    


            Rob Malley, a former US official who was a lead negotiator on the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, told CNN that a “short-term, fragile arrangement” is theoretically possible – one that could give both sides “a victory.”
    


            Under the agreement with the Obama administration, Iran's uranium enrichment and number of centrifuges were limited without completely eliminating the program.
    


            After strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities last year, decades of crippling economic sanctions and the deterioration of its regional proxies, Iran has weakened - giving Trump an opportunity to extract commitments from Tehran that it will indefinitely suspend enrichment or face further military action.
    


            “Iran could make the case that its suspension was born of necessity, given the June (2025) strikes and the unsafe state of its nuclear program and claim that it needs time before being able to resume enrichment.”
    


            “For its part, the US would maintain that it has preserved its position that Iran should never enrich on its soil. … Both sides could describe it as a victory of sorts: Iran, by pointing to the fact that it has not relinquished the right to enrich and the US by boasting that President Trump had achieved what neither Obama nor Biden could, which is a halt to Iranian enrichment.”
    


            Seyed Hossein Mousavian, a former Iranian diplomat who served as the spokesman for Iran during its nuclear negotiations with the European Union from 2003 to 2005, told CNN that conditions now are “very different” from the past but are “more favorable” for a deal where the Islamic Republic would provide firm guarantees that it will permanently remain as a non-nuclear weapon state.
    


            “Iran's current negotiations are centered on survival and the preservation of its territorial integrity and national sovereignty. In this regard, Iran will under no circumstances bargain away its defensive deterrence capabilities,” Mousavian said.
    


            Malley added, “Of course, whether President Trump is open to a nuclear-only deal, or will insist that it covers ballistic missiles, Iran's regional partners, or even its domestic policies, is a whole other matter.”

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Late-night host Stephen Colbert said his interview with Democratic Texas Senate candidate James Talarico was pulled from Monday night's broadcast over network fears it would violate regulatory guidance from the Trump administration on giving equal time to political candidates.

The issue came just hours before early voting opened Tuesday in Texas' primary elections, which feature hotly-contested Senate nomination races in both parties. 

“He was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,” Colbert said on his program, ”The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”

“Then I was told, in some uncertain terms, that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on. And because my network clearly doesn't want us to talk about this, let's talk about this.”

Talarico is in a spirited contest for the Democratic nomination as media institutions are navigating around changing broadcast guidance, issued under the Trump administration, governing how they interview political candidates. His main opponent is U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, and both have built national profiles through viral social media clips.

On the Republican side, four-term incumbent Sen. John Cornyn is facing the political fight of his career against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt. Paxton stepped up his campaign with a Monday night rally in Tyler in east Texas. 

Talarico posted a nearly minute-long clip of his interview with Colbert on X, calling it “the interview Donald Trump didn't want you to see.” He planned to have a Tuesday evening rally in Austin. 

“I think Donald Trump is worried we're about to flip Texas,” Talarico said in a statement. “This is the most dangerous kind of cancel culture, the kind that comes from the top.”

Broadcast networks have been required to give equal time to political candidates, but that rule hasn't traditionally been applied to talk shows. In January, the Federal Communications Commission issued new guidance warning late-night and daytime hosts that they need to give political candidates equal time, with FCC Chairman Brendan Carr questioning the talk show exemption and positing that hosts were “motivated by partisan purposes.” 




“The FCC has not been presented with any evidence that the interview portion of any late night or daytime television talk show program on air presently would qualify for the bona fide news exemption,” according to the public notice.

In his comments, Colbert noted that the equal time provision applies to broadcast but not streaming platforms. Subsequently, his nearly 15-minute interview with Talarico was posted to the YouTube page for Colbert's show, with the host noting specifically that the segment was only appearing online and not on broadcast.

Neither CBS nor the FCC immediately responded to messages seeking comment Tuesday.

Carr, appointed by Trump to lead the agency last year, has often criticized network talk shows, suggesting last year that probing ABC's “The View” — whose hosts have frequently been critical of Trump — over the exemption might be “worthwhile.”

Colbert's days in his host chair are limited, following CBS' announcement last year that it was canceling his show this May for financial reasons, shuttering a decades-old TV institution in a changing media landscape.

But the timing of that announcement — three days after Colbert criticized the settlement between Trump and Paramount Global, parent company of CBS, over a “60 Minutes” story — led two U.S. senators to publicly question the motives behind the move, which served to remove from air one of Trump's most prominent and persistent late-night critics.

Meanwhile, Talarico and Crockett are hoping to avoid a May 26 runoff by capturing at least 50% of the Democratic vote in the March 3 primary. Paxton, too, is trying to avoid a runoff, and until Friday, the only ad his relatively low-key campaign ran had attacked Hunt.

Hunt is trying to appeal to voters seeking an alternative to Cornyn but uneasy about Paxton. The Texas attorney general beat a 2023 impeachment trial on corruption charges and reached a deal to end a long-running securities fraud case but now faces a contentious divorce over allegations of adultery.

Hunt released a new ad Tuesday, with photos of him with Trump, hitting Cornyn over his long political year and declaring, “This is our moment to end the status quo.” 

But Paxton's campaign has been airing its own ad featuring video clips of him with Trump since Friday. The president had not endorsed any candidate as of Monday. Paxton on Monday night portrayed Cornyn as a creature of the Washington establishment, adding, “Well, I'm not their person and I'm never going to be their person.” 

Early voting began with Paxton looking like the GOP's front-runner, even though Cornyn's campaign and allied super PACs had spent more than $54 million on television advertising since last year, according to the ad-tracing service AdImpact. Paxton believes he's even better known than Cornyn.

Republican Senate leaders in Washington say Paxton as the GOP nominee would require hundreds of millions of dollars more to defend in a general election than Cornyn would — and that the party shouldn't have to spend in a state Trump carried by over 13 percentage points. 

Cornyn hit on those concerns in a Tuesday rally in Austin.

“We'll pay the price of having an albatross like our corrupt attorney general around their neck,” he said. “It will take a toll on everybody on the ballot.”

Team USA men's speedskating took home a silver medal on Tuesday at the 2026 Milan Cortina Games, finishing just behind Italy in the team pursuit competition.

The team comprised of Ethan Cepuran, Casey Dawson and Emery Lehman finished with a time of 3:43.71 and was good enough for second place in the event. Italy's team, featuring Davide Ghiotto, Andrea Giovannini and Michele Malfatti, clinched the gold medal with a time of 3:39.20.

The U.S. started well against Italy this time around but the Italians charged ahead in the closing laps.

It's the second team pursuit medal for Cepuran, Dawson and Lehman. They were on the team with Joey Matia at the 2022 Beijing Olympics. The trio set a world record in team pursuit in November with a time of 3:32.49.

Cepuran, Dawson and Lehman had hoped that their team effort would have been able to be enough to capture the gold. They previously acknowledged that they weren't the strongest of skaters but knew they were a great team. Dawson withdrew from the Olympic 10,000 meters last week to focus on team pursuit.

            • Family not suspects: Nancy Guthrie's adult children and their spouses are not suspects in her February 1 disappearance from her Arizona home, the sheriff said yesterday, calling any suggestion otherwise “cruel.”
    


            • Examining evidence: Investigators are combing through thousands of tips and poring over evidence, including DNA on a glove found two miles from Guthrie's home; unidentified DNA on her property; and a backpack seen in a video of the suspect. The sheriff hopes DNA test results will come back today, he said.
    


            • No leading theory: Authorities have said they believe the 84-year-old mother of “Today” anchor Savannah Guthrie was removed from the home against her will. But investigators still have no leading theory about a motive, a source said.
    


            • Tip lines: If you have information that could help investigators, you can call 1-800-CALL-FBI or 520-351-4900. You can also submit information at tips.fbi.gov.
    


            Nancy Guthrie's family members are not suspects in her disappearance, the sheriff said, as authorities continue to comb through thousands of tips and analyze DNA in an attempt to identify the suspect and find the missing 84-year-old.
    


            Here's what we know:
    


            Investigators are awaiting the results of DNA tests on the glove found about two miles from Nancy Guthrie's property, and Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said he is hopeful the results could come back today.
    


            The glove appears to match the one worn by the suspect seen in front doorbell camera footage at the home, the FBI said.
    


            Investigators are running the DNA from the glove through the CODIS national database to check for a match with known offender profiles.
    


            Authorities will also compare the glove DNA to DNA recovered at Guthrie's home, which they said does not match her or anyone in her immediate circle.
    


            That could be a significant development in the investigation, but experts caution that the results may not be announced to the public immediately.
    


            Law enforcement experts say authorities are more likely to prioritize tracking down the suspect.
    


            CNN's Kate Bolduan speaks with David Kennedy, who helped create technology used to track bluetooth signals from pacemakers, about how it can be used in the search for Nancy Guthrie.
    


            Monday's statement from the Pima County sheriff that said Nancy Guthrie's family members are not suspects in her disappearance is a direct response to so-called “armchair detectives” who have wildly — and sometimes irresponsibly — speculated about the case.
    


            No matter how well-intentioned the online guessing games have been, the chatter has been distracting, at best, and actively harming the investigation, at worst.
    


            “The Guthrie family are victims plain and simple,” Sheriff Chris Nanos said Monday, suggesting claims to the contrary risk revictimizing the family members.
    


            Law enforcement officials previously tried to make this point in private conversations with members of the media, but the family member finger-pointing has been happening mostly in a parallel universe of true-crime influencers and amateur sleuths.
    


            Now that the point has been made publicly, that the family members are not suspects, “let's hope this puts an end to the reckless and malicious nonsense,” a longtime friend of Savannah Guthrie's remarked to CNN. The friend spoke on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.
    


            There has been a yawning gap between what traditional news outlets have been saying about the Nancy Guthrie investigation and what new-media influencers have been saying.
    


            The influencer content has been more raw, more participatory, and more speculative, with commentary often crossing lines that journalists are taught to avoid, partly to avoid libeling innocent people.
    


            The influencer content is also appealing to some viewers and readers for the same reasons it is controversial. And, as a person involved in the Guthrie investigation told CNN last week, there is a recognition that the online energy can be helpful as well as hurtful: “The breakthrough tip could come from anyone, from anywhere.”
    


            As days have turned into weeks, speculation about certain Guthrie family members intensified in online communities, particularly in circles where there is deep ingrained distrust of major media outlets.
    


            Nanos said on Monday that the suggestions about a family member being responsible for Nancy's disappearance have been “cruel.”
    


            Some amateur sleuths who have drawn online crowds with their commentary about the case reacted on Monday by saying, in effect, they were just trying to help. Some also criticized the sheriff for not making the public statement sooner.
    


            The Pima County Sheriff's Department says the Guthrie family are not suspected of wrongdoing in the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie.
    


            CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller explains how investigators would have examined the family before ruling them out.
    


            CNN's Brian Stelter takes a look at the true crime influencers and online sleuths who have faced backlash over their Nancy Guthrie coverage.

Turning 34 in April, it's becoming more and more likely that Aaron Judge may join Don Mattingly as the only New York Yankees captains without a World Series ring in the modern era.

Judge is coming off his third MVP season in the last four years but remains without what really matters in Yankees universe: a title.

Well, after Judge's Yankees were bounced in the American League Division Series last season, they're running it back with an almost identical team.

At one point, the Yankees offseason looked bleak — or as Judge put it, "brutal."

"I'm seeing other teams around the league get better. They're making trades, they're signing big prospects or big players and we kind of were sitting there for a while, kind of making smaller moves," Judge said.

"Early on, it was pretty tough to watch. I'm like, 'Man, we're the New York Yankees, let's go out there and get the right people, get the right pieces to go out there and finish this thing off.'"

But after the Yankees re-signed Cody Bellinger, Trent Grisham and Paul Goldschmidt, Judge was content.

"I think once we solidified getting Bellinger back, we got Trent being our center fielder, being our leadoff guy for another year. You add a guy like Goldy, some of the back-end bullpen pieces that we've been doing, I think we'll be in a good spot…" Judge said.

"We've got a special group of players here. We've got a good core, good young core. It was frustrating, but I think we're right where we need to be."

The Yankees finished with 94 wins and tied for the best record in the American League but lost the tiebreaker to the Toronto Blue Jays, who overpowered them in the ALDS.

A Savannah, Georgia elementary school teacher was killed Monday morning in a traffic collision after authorities say a man fleeing federal immigration officers crashed into her vehicle.

The crash happened about 7:45 a.m. on Monday at a busy intersection, according to the Chatham County Police Department. Officers responding to the scene found two vehicles involved. Both drivers were transported to a hospital, where the female driver was pronounced dead. The male driver, identified as 38-year-old Oscar Vasquez Lopez, sustained non-life-threatening injuries.

Savannah-Chatham County Public Schools announced that the victim was Dr. Linda Davis, a teacher at Hesse K-8 School. In a statement, the school district said counselors will be available at the school this week to support students and staff.

"Dr. Linda Davis was a beloved member of our school family and her loss has affected us deeply," Hesse K-8 School said in a statement.

Police said there were no passengers in either vehicle. A second bystander vehicle was also involved in the incident, but no injuries were reported and no one from that vehicle required medical treatment.

Vasquez Lopez was taken into custody and is expected to be booked into the Chatham County Detention Center. He faces charges of first-degree homicide by vehicle, reckless driving, driving without a valid license and failure to obey a traffic control device.

In a statement, DHS said ICE officers had attempted to apprehend Vasquez Lopez, whom the agency described as a Guatemalan national with a final order of removal issued by a federal judge in 2024.

The agency said he initially complied with a traffic stop but then fled, making a U-turn and running a red light before colliding with another vehicle.

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called the crash "an absolute tragedy" and said fleeing from federal law enforcement is both a crime and dangerous.

"This vehicular homicide is an absolute tragedy and deadly consequence of politicians and the media constantly demonizing ICE officers and encouraging those here illegally to resist arrest—a felony," McLaughlin said. "These dangerous tactics are putting people's lives at risk. Fleeing from and resisting federal law enforcement is not only a crime but extraordinarily dangerous and puts oneself, our officers, and innocent civilians at risk. Now, an innocent bystander has lost their life."

Local police said they were not involved in the federal operation, attempted stop or pursuit and were unaware of the enforcement action until after the crash.

Officers on routine patrol were near the scene and responded almost immediately, authorities said.

Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports on President Donald Trump's stance on Iran on ‘America Reports.'

Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth has ordered Army Secretary Dan Driscoll to remove Col. Dave Butler from his current job serving as chief of Army public affairs and chief advisor to Driscoll, who currently is in Geneva serving on the negotiating team to end the Ukraine war, Fox News has learned. 

Butler served as the head of public affairs for the Joint Chiefs when Gen. Mark Milley was chairman, and was slated to receive his first star. His name appeared for two years in a row on an Army list of 34 officers selected for promotion. 

That list has been held up by Hegseth for nearly four months because he reportedly has concerns about four to five officers selected by the Army board, but by law he cannot remove them from the list. Butler volunteered to take his name off the promotion list if it would help unlock the other promotions, according to an Army official.

Driscoll, an Army veteran and close ally of Vice President JD Vance – he attended Yale Law School with the vice president – had resisted Hegseth's pressure to fire Butler for months because of his ongoing contributions to the transformation of the Army.

"We greatly appreciate COL Dave Butler's lifetime of service in America's Army and to our nation," Driscoll said in a statement. "Dave has been an integral part of the Army's transformation efforts and I sincerely wish him tremendous success in his upcoming retirement after 28 years of service." 

Butler traveled with Driscoll to Ukraine in November 2025 to help jump-start negotiations.

The demand by Hegseth came Thursday, Fox News has learned.

Hegseth entered the Pentagon in 2025 and immediately began firing top officers or forcing them into early retirement without giving a reason or for cause: Adm. Lisa Franchetti, who was serving as chief of naval operations; Gen. CQ Brown, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Gen. James Mingus, who was serving as vice chief of the Army; Gen. Douglas A. Sims, director of the Joint Staff; Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin; Gen. James Slife, vice chief of the Air Force; and Gen. Timothy Haugh, director of the National Security Agency, among others.

The unexplained firings have led to fear, uncertainty and an unwillingness to speak up among senior military leaders.

FIRED UNDER TRUMP, FORMER MILITARY OFFICERS LAUNCH DEMOCRATIC BIDS FOR CONGRESS

One of the Army's best communicators, Butler served alongside the nation's tiered special operations units on countless missions overseas attached to the Army's Delta Force from 2010 to 2014. 

He served as the public affairs officer to Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, from 2015 to 2018. He worked as the public affairs officer for Gen. Scott Miller when he was Joint Special Operations Command commander from 2016 to 2018, and then, at Miller's request, served in Afghanistan when Miller deployed there from 2018 to 2019.  

Butler served as the chief spokesman and director of communications for all U.S. and NATO forces during that time that Miller served as the top four-star general in Afghanistan.

A former four-star commander who once commanded U.S. Special Operations said Butler was "the consummate professional, the most competent Public Affairs officer I have ever worked with and a gifted practitioner of strategic communications."

During the Army's 250th birthday celebrations in 2025, President Donald Trump recognized Butler by name for helping the Army chief to organize the parade in Washington, D.C.

Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, discusses the 'SAVE Act,' detailing citizenship proof requirements for voter registration and debunking claims it blocks married women on 'The Will Cain Show.'

North Carolina's elections board came to an agreement with the Republican and Democratic parties on Monday to give 73,000 voters more time to update their voter registrations before they are removed from voter rolls.

The settlement concludes an extended legal battle that rose after the Republican National Committee and North Carolina GOP sued state election officials in 2024, claiming that roughly 250,000 voters had been improperly registered. The voters in question did not provide the last four digits of their Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers or an attestation that they had neither on their registrations.

Republicans had requested that the voters be removed from rolls and their votes in the 2024 elections be thrown out. The Democratic National Committee hailed the settlement as a win on Monday, accusing the GOP of voter suppression.

"This latest victory is a win for Americans and yet another blow to the Republicans' scheme to disenfranchise voters ahead of the midterm elections," DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement after the settlement.

The North Carolina State Board of Elections admitted that roughly 100,000 voters lacked proper identification as of last summer. As of December, that number had shrunk to roughly 73,000.

Monday's agreement allows those voters to stay on the voter rolls, with their information to be updated when they cast a ballot. North Carolina law requires voters to show ID when voting.

The settlement comes amid a federal battle over voter ID requirements, with the GOP pushing the Safeguarding American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) America Act, which passed the House last week and is expected to face a vote in the Senate. The bill would impose a blanket requirement for voters to provide proof of citizenship before casting a ballot.

KEY HOUSE COMMITTEE ADVANCES NATIONWIDE VOTER ID BILL, SETTING UP 2026 ELECTION FIGHT

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., vowed Sunday that Senate Democrats will block the effort.

"We will not let it pass in the Senate," Schumer told CNN's Jake Tapper. "We are fighting it tooth and nail. It's an outrageous proposal that is, you know, that shows the sort of political bias of the MAGA right. They don't want poor people to vote. They don't want people of color to vote because they often don't vote for them."

Schumer's comments came after Tapper pressed him on his opposition, noting that polling shows roughly 83% of Americans support some form of voter identification. That figure comes from a Pew Research poll published last year that found 71% of Democratic voters surveyed supported presenting an ID to vote.

In addition to ID requirements, the GOP-backed bill would establish a system for state election officials to share information with federal authorities to verify voter rolls. It would also allow the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to pursue immigration cases if noncitizens are found listed as eligible voters.

Democrats have attempted to paint the bill as racist.

"What they are proposing in this so-called SAVE Act is like Jim Crow 2.0," Schumer said. "They make it so hard to get any kind of voter ID that more than 20 million legitimate people, mainly poorer people and people of color, will not be able to vote under this law."

The father of a Georgia teen accused of killing four at Apalachee High School is on trial. Prosecutors say he ignored warning signs and gave his son the gun used in the attack.

A Georgia father went on trial Monday, as he stands accused of enabling the 2024 high school shooting that left two students and two teachers dead by giving his teenage son access to a rifle despite repeated warning signs.

Colin Gray faces nearly 30 felony counts, including second-degree murder, involuntary manslaughter and cruelty to children, in connection with the Sept. 4 attack at Apalachee High School in Winder. Prosecutors argue his decision to arm his son directly led to the killings.

"This is not a case about holding parents accountable for what their children do," Barrow County District Attorney Brad Smith told jurors during opening statements. "This case is about this defendant and his actions in allowing a child that he has custody over access to a firearm and ammunition after being warned that that child was going to harm others."

Under Georgia law, second-degree murder can apply when someone causes the death of a child while committing cruelty to children — the underlying felony prosecutors allege in this case. Smith told jurors the charges are structured around the victims, tying cruelty-to-children counts to the deaths of the students and reckless-conduct allegations to involuntary manslaughter counts for the slain teachers.

UVALDE TRIAL HALTED AFTER KEY WITNESS CHANGES TESTIMONY

Investigators have said Colt Gray, 14 at the time, brought a semiautomatic rifle to school in his backpack, left class and opened fire in a classroom and hallways. Two school resource officers took him into custody, authorities said.

Defense attorney Brian Hobbs argued the teen hid his plans from his father. 

"You cannot hold someone criminally responsible for failing to predict what was intentionally hidden from them," Hobbs said.

Prosecutors pointed to what they described as a pattern of escalating red flags that were not acted upon.

JURY REACHES VERDICT IN TRIAL OF EX-UVALDE SCHOOL POLICE OFFICER ACCUSED OF FAILING TO CONFRONT GUNMAN

In 2021, Colt Gray used a school computer to search "how to kill your dad," Smith said. In May 2023, authorities investigated an online shooting threat traced to a computer at the Gray home after receiving a tip from the FBI. Colt Gray denied making the threat and said his account had been hacked, according to prosecutors. Smith said investigators asked Colin Gray at the time to restrict his son's access to guns.

Despite those incidents, prosecutors allege Colin Gray gave his son the rifle as a Christmas gift later that year and continued buying accessories, including what Smith described as "a lot of ammunition."

Smith also told jurors that on the morning of the shooting, Colt's mother called the school after receiving alarming text messages and warned a counselor that her son had access to firearms, prompting administrators to begin searching for him.

FORMER UVALDE SCHOOL OFFICER SAYS HE DOESN'T REGRET ACTIONS AFTER NOT GUILTY VERDICT

Prosecutors have said Colin Gray knew his son was obsessed with school shooters and had received a troubling text weeks before the attack that read: "Whenever something happens, just know the blood is on your hands."

An investigator testified that Gray was aware his son's mental health had deteriorated and had sought counseling services.

"This is not a case about holding parents accountable for what their children do," Barrow County District Attorney Brad Smith told jurors during opening statements. (Jason Getz/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP)

"We have had a very difficult past couple of years and he needs help. Anger, anxiety, quick to be volatile. I don't know what to do," Gray wrote, according to testimony.

Smith told jurors that despite those concerns, Gray did not pursue inpatient treatment for his son.

The trial is being held in Barrow County, where the shooting occurred, with jurors brought in from neighboring Hall County due to pretrial publicity.

Colt Gray is behind bars while awaiting his own trial. Day 2 of testimony in his father's trial will proceed later Tuesday. 

The case is among a growing number nationwide in which prosecutors are seeking to hold parents criminally responsible in deadly school shootings.

By EMMA BURROWS, EVGENIY MALOLETKA and KWIYEON HA

February 17, 2026


Growing up in a village in northern Greenland, Jørgen Kristensen's closest friends were his stepfather's sled dogs. Most of his classmates were dark-haired Inuit; he was different. When he was bullied at school for his fair hair — an inheritance from the mainland Danish father he never knew — the dogs came to him.



He first went out to fish on the ice with them alone when he was 9 years old. They nurtured the beginning of a life-long love affair and Kristensen's career as a five-time Greenlandic dog sled champion.



“I was just a small child. But many years later, I started thinking about why I love dogs so much,” Kristensen, 62, told The Associated Press.



“The dogs were a great support,” he said. “They lifted me up when I was sad.”



For more than a thousand years, dogs have pulled sleds across the Arctic for Inuit seal hunters and fishermen. But this winter, in the town of Ilulissat, around 300km (186 miles) north of the Arctic Circle, that's not possible.



Instead of gliding over snow and ice, Kristensen's sled bounces over earth and rock. Gesturing to the hills, he said it's the first time he can remember when there has been no snow — or ice in the bay — in January.



The rising temperatures in Ilulissat are causing the permafrost to melt, buildings to sink and pipes to crack but they also have consequences that ripple across the rest of the world.



The nearby Sermeq Kujalleq glacier is one of the fastest-moving and most active on the planet, sending more icebergs into the sea than any other glacier outside Antarctica, according to the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO. As the climate has warmed, the glacier has retreated and carved off chunks of ice faster than ever before — significantly contributing to sea levels that are rising from Europe to the Pacific Islands, according to NASA.



The melting ice could reveal untapped deposits of critical minerals. Many Greenlanders believe that's why U.S. President Donald Trump turned their island into a geopolitical hotspot with his demands to own it and previous suggestions that the U.S. could take it by force.



In the 1980s, winter temperatures in Ilulissat regularly hovered around -25 Celsius (-13 Fahrenheit) in winter, Kristensen said.



But nowadays, he said, there are many days when the temperature is above freezing — sometimes it can be as warm as 10 Celsius (50 Fahrenheit.)



Kristensen said he now has to collect snow for the dogs to drink during a journey because there isn't any along the route.



Although Greenlanders have always adapted — and could make dog sleds with wheels in future — the loss of the ice is affecting them deeply, said Kristensen, who now runs his own company showing tourists his Arctic homeland.



“If we lose the dog sledding, we have large parts of our culture that we're losing. That scares me,” he told AP, pressing his lips together and becoming tearful.



In winter, hunters should be able to take their dogs far out on the sea ice, Kristensen told AP. The ice sheets act like “big bridges,” connecting Greenlanders to hunting grounds but also to other Inuit communities across the Arctic in Canada, the United States and Russia.



“When the sea ice used to come, we felt completely open along the entire coast and we could decide where to go,” Kristensen said.



This January, there was no ice at all.



Driving a dog sled on ice is like being “completely without boundaries — like on the world's longest and widest highway,” he said. Not having that is “a very great loss.”



Several years ago, Greenland's government had to provide financial support to many families in the far north of the island after the sea ice did not freeze hard enough for hunting, said Sara Olsvig, chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Council, which represents Inuit people from across Arctic nations.



The warming weather also makes life more dangerous for fishermen who have swapped their dog sleds for boats, because there is more rain instead of snow, said Morgan Angaju Josefsen Røjkjær, Kristensen's business partner.



When snow falls and is compressed, air is trapped between the flakes, giving the ice its brilliant white color. But when rain freezes, the ice that forms contains little air and looks more like glass.



A fisherman can see the white ice and try to avoid it, but the ice formed from rain takes on the color of the sea – and that's dangerous because “it can sink you or throw you off your boat,” said Røjkjær.



Climate change, Olsvig said, “is affecting us deeply,” and is amplified in the Arctic, which is “warming three to four times faster than the global average.”



Over the course of his lifetime, the Sermeq Kujalleq glacier has retreated by about 40 kilometers (25 miles) said Karl Sandgreen, 46, the head of Ilulissat's Icefjord Center which is dedicated to documenting the glacier and its icebergs.



Looking out of the window at hills which would normally be covered with snow, Sandgreen described mountain rock revealed by melting ice and a previously ice-covered valley inside the fjord where “there's nothing now.” It's unclear, he said, if the town can hold its ice music festival in February — because there might not be any ice or snow.



Pollution is also speeding up the ice melt, Sandgreen said, describing how Sermeq Kujalleq is melting from the top down, unlike glaciers in Antarctica which largely melt from the bottom up as sea temperatures rise.



This is exacerbated by two things: black carbon, or soot spewed from ship engines, and debris from volcanic eruptions. They blanket the snow and ice with dark material and reduce reflection of sunlight, instead absorbing more heat and speeding up melting. Black carbon has increased in recent decades with more ship traffic in the Arctic, and nearby Iceland has periodic volcanic eruptions.



Many Greenlanders told AP they believe the melting ice is the reason Trump — a leader who has called climate change “the greatest con job ever” — wants to own the island.



“His agenda is to get the minerals,” Sandgreen said.



Since Trump returned to office, fewer climate scientists from the U.S. have visited Ilulissat, Sandgreen said. The U.S president needs to “listen to the scientists,” who are documenting the impact of global warming, he said.



Kristensen said he tries to explain the consequences of global warming to the tourists who he takes out on dog sled rides or on visits to the icebergs. He said he tells them how Greenland's glaciers are as important as the Amazon rainforest in Brazil.



International summits, such as the United Nations climate talks in November in the Amazon gateway city of Belem, play a role, but it's just as important to “teach children all over the world” about the importance of ice and oceans, alongside subjects like math, Kristensen said.



“If we don't start with the children, we can't really do anything to help nature. We can only destroy it,” Kristensen said.

A suspect accused of shooting and killing two people at a Rhode Island ice rink on Monday before killing himself was identified as transgender and had a history of past family conflict over his gender identity, a local news outlet reported, citing court documents.

Court records show Robert Dorgan had been involved in multiple disputes with relatives in recent years, including allegations that tensions escalated after he underwent gender reassignment surgery, according to WPRI.

Dorgan, 56, is accused of opening fire inside the Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket during a hockey game between Coventry and Blackstone Valley Schools in what police described as a "family dispute," Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves said at a press conference Monday.

Authorities said two victims were killed and the suspect died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Three others were injured and remain hospitalized.

A federal law enforcement source told Fox News the gunman killed his wife and shot three of his children before turning the gun on himself in what the source described as a domestic violence incident.

In 2020, Dorgan reported to North Providence police that he had undergone gender-reassignment surgery and said his father-in-law wanted him out of the family home because of it. Police identified the suspect by the birth name Robert Dorgan and said he also went by "Roberta."

According to court documents cited by WPRI, Dorgan alleged his father-in-law used a derogatory term for transgender individuals and threatened retaliation if he did not move out. The father-in-law was charged at the time, though prosecutors later dismissed the case.

Court filings also show Dorgan's then-wife initially cited "gender reassignment surgery, narcissistic + personality disorder traits" in divorce paperwork before the grounds were amended to "irreconcilable differences." The divorce was finalized in 2021. Divorce records list Dorgan as living in Jacksonville, Florida, at the time and working as a truck driver.

Also in 2020, Dorgan accused his mother of assaulting him and acting in a "violent, threatening or tumultuous manner," according to police records cited by WPRI. His mother was charged with simple assault and battery and disorderly conduct, though the case was later dismissed, court records show.

The dispute was also referenced in Dorgan's conflict with his father-in-law. According to court documents, Dorgan told police his father-in-law "told me that if I did not drop the assault charges against my mother that further retaliation could be expected and that was another reason to have me killed."

Police have not said whether those past disputes were connected to Monday's violence, and investigators have not publicly identified a motive. Goncalves said the shooting "looked like it was a family dispute" and that detectives are still working to establish a timeline.

"I spend every night in the village," she told NBC. "It's been everything and more, and you can't evict me," she said. "I don't think there's anything not to enjoy. I haven't even got to compete yet and I feel like my experience is already complete. Not complete, but I'm having a blast. The best time."

Levito will compete in the short program before the free skate later in the week.

"I feel really good. I feel very trained," she added. "I'm very excited. I feel like I'm in a really good spot. I'm really excited to soak this all in."

AMERICAN ELANA MEYERS TAYLOR FINALLY CAPTURES GOLD MEDAL AT WINTER OLYMPICS, MAKES TEAM USA HISTORY

Levito, Glenn and Liu are known collectively as the "Blade Angels," which is an homage to "Charlie's Angels" after rejecting other suggestions like the "Powerpuff Girls" and "Babes of Glory."

The 18-year-old was born in Philadelphia but hails from Mount Holly, New Jersey. This year's Olympics are her first appearance.

She took home the gold in women's singles in the 2023 U.S. Championships. She picked up silvers in the 2024 World Championships and the 2022-23 Grand Prix Final.

MILAN (AP) — Olympic hockey knows all about big hits.

That now includes “Heated Rivalry,” a gay hockey romance TV series in which two players from opposing teams carry out a secret, long-term relationship.

The steamy connection between the characters — Canadian Shane Hollander and Russian Ilya Rozanov — has attracted fans to both the show and the sport itself, with the NHL seeing a boost in ticket sales by one estimate.

The show's impact was evident long before the Milan Cortina Games when co-stars Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie carried the Olympic flame. And it hasn't stopped there. Athletes and fans from Canada and the U.S. are feeling the show's impact.

Zach Werenski, a defenseman on the U.S. team who plays for the NHL's Columbus Blue Jackets, said the show has come up in conversation in the locker room.

“Everyone is saying how great it is, I just haven't seen it yet,” Werenski told The Associated Press after a 5-1 victory over Latvia. “It's definitely good for the sport of hockey. Whenever you can add more eyes to the game and have people talk about the game and talk about inclusivity, I think it's just great for the sport.”

Jake Sanderson, another U.S. defenseman who plays for the Ottawa Senators, said he has heard about the show, but doesn't know much about it. When asked how far off the NHL is from having an openly gay player, Sanderson cited Luke Prokop. In 2021, Prokop was a Nashville Predators prospect who became the first player signed to an NHL contract to come out, though he has not yet played in the league.

“You never know if that show (will) instill some confidence in some people,” said Sanderson, adding that any openly gay player would be fully accepted in the locker room. “I don't think we would treat them any differently. They're our teammate, we love them no matter what, and obviously embrace them, absolutely.”




Rachel Reid's novel “Heated Rivalry” was published in 2019 as part of a series. The TV adaptation, originally developed for Canadian streaming service Crave, was the top-rated series on HBO Max in its first season. It has been renewed for a second season.

“It's obviously a show about hockey that's sparked a lot of interest in people even outside of our game,” Canada's Travis Sanheim said Tuesday. “Just heard a lot of people talking about. It's obviously good to have our game being talked about.”

Its biggest fans at the Olympics may be the Canadian delegation.

As part of the Olympic experience, athletes were gifted a potted plant. Many of the Canadians named theirs Shane or Ilya, according to the delegation's lead press liaison, Tara MacBournie.

Canadian Alpine skier Kiki Alexander took the love a bit further, sharing on TikTok that the village's Canadian moose has been named Shane.

“If you know, you know,” she wrote.

Adam van Koeverden, a 2004 Olympic champion in canoeing who is now Canada's secretary of state for sport, is a fan of the show.

“We're the perfect country to be having the conversation and be putting that art out there that I think is advancing the conversation on diversity in hockey,” van Koeverden told the AP at the Games. “Hockey is for everyone and ‘Heated Rivalry' makes it clear.”

The show launched in Europe in January and is proving a surprise hit in Russia, despite the country's anti-LGBTQ+ crackdowns. Because of the war in Ukraine, the IOC has allowed just a handful of Russian athletes to compete at the Milan Cortina Games as neutral individuals.

Athletes aren't the only ones riding the “Heated Rivalry” wave. Kim Sweet of Calgary, Alberta, is only on Episode 3 but is loving it.

“The show has me very intrigued,” Sweet, 50, said before entering the arena to watch Canada play Czechia last week. “How a very male-dominated sport has two guys having to work through the privacy of it all, and whether you ever want to come out.”

“It's great having more eyes on the sport,” added Sweet, who described herself as “a huge hockey fan.”

Angie Campos, a California resident, was also in attendance and wearing a sweatshirt featuring the jerseys of the show's main characters.

Campos is new to hockey, drawn to it by the series, and she isn't alone. Weekly NHL ticket sales saw a more than 20% rise after the show debuted in late November, according to data from ticketing platform SeatGeek. It saw no similar surge the same period a year earlier.

“The series didn't just light up social media feeds, it may have sent fans straight to hockey games themselves,” SeatGeek said in its analysis Jan. 16. “While it's impossible to attribute all of this growth to a single show, the timing is hard to ignore.”

Campos likened her newfound fandom and that of fellow “Heated Rivalry” viewers to the surge of female NFL fans after Taylor Swift started dating Kansas City Chiefs player Travis Kelce and attending games.

“It just makes it a little bit more relatable and it has definitely opened eyes to a human side of competition,” she said.

Hockey is a rough-and-tumble sport with occasional fighting and hard hits, even in crucial games where a penalty can prove costly. Canada's Tom Wilson and Pierre Crinon of France were ejected for fighting in Canada's win on Sunday.

All the machismo and aggression make the rink — and hockey in general — an unlikely and provocative setting to explore the delicate feelings of forbidden love and taboos around male sexual orientation. No active NHL player has come out as gay in the century-plus existence of the league.

“Heated Rivalry” has been wildly popular among women, but men are starting to find the appeal.

At the Canada-France game, Christopher Ryan York, 20, said he has hopped on the bandwagon, too. It was hard not to watch the show given how popular it has become, he said, and he's happy it's creating new hockey fans.

“Anything to grow the sport, for sure,” he added.

His father Kevin York, 60, said he hasn't seen the show, but can't stop hearing about it back home in Alberta and believes it must be truly inspirational if it spurred a Canadian hockey player to come out as gay: Jesse Kortuem of Vancouver, who stepped away from the game at 17 for fear he wouldn't be accepted, shared his coming-out statement on Instagram on Jan. 13.

“Something has sparked in me (ok — yes credit to #HeatedRivalry),” he wrote. “I thought I would share because I want to speak to the athletes out there who are still in the closet or struggling to find their way. I want you to know that there is hope and you're not alone.”

            Sand sprays in all directions as Kyle Goetsch sprints at full pelt across the Namib desert, his stride broken only momentarily as he screams at the stunned group behind him to start running. All the while, the animal stalks ever closer, pale moonlight silhouetting its colossal form.
    


            Yet all is not what it seems. This is not the climax of a blockbuster natural horror film, even if cameras are everywhere. Rather, a nature photographer is hurtling toward the shot of a lifetime.
    


            Goetsch's breathtaking image of a giraffe cresting a sand dune, staring down the barrel of the lens from the center of a hazy pink moon, is among the best in a jaw-dropping bunch of photos that have helped the South African build an impressive social media following.
    


            For some viewers, it's almost too brilliant.
    


            “This is one of the photos that gets most called out for being AI,” Goetsch told CNN.
    


            “I think that's a compliment because it just shows how unique the image is … It's just so rare and unique to get all these elements to align.”
    


This photographer spent 10 years chasing the perfect shot of a rare species. This is how he got it



            While artificial intelligence was totally absent, luck was very much in attendance.
    


            Cape Town-based Goetsch, who runs workshops across southern Africa for budding photographers, had led clients into the world's oldest desert in order to shoot the full moon rising over an old tree atop a dune.
    


            Though aware giraffes were nearby, all plans went out the window during setup when Goetsch turned to see a long-necked giant ­— likely intrigued by the nearby noise — ambling toward the group.
    


            Realizing it would pass directly in front of the low-hanging moon, Goetsch scooped up his camera and tripod to race into position before it was too late.
    


            “You have a very short window to try and capture what, in my mind, was going to be an incredible image and it ended up being that,” he recalled.
    


            “Once we lined it up and I took those first photos, I knew I had them in the bank … You've to seize the day.”
    


            The fact that image qualifies as one of Goetsch's personal favorites, followed closely by those taken when another giraffe arrived to nuzzle the first, is high praise, given the sheer breadth of his eight-year camera roll.
    


            Photography was a stark career change for someone with a PhD in biochemistry, but after so much time spent squinting through microscopes, the University of Cape Town graduate never looked back after seeing the beauty of his hometown through the lens on a trip with a friend in 2018.
    


            Somewhat ironically, Goetsch quickly morphed from an expert on the tiniest molecules to a guru of the skies and stars above, as astrophotography quickly became a passion.
    


            That transition was aided by the career-launching impact of his viral photo that captured the Milky Way looming above the prominent Lion's Head mountain peak in Cape Town, a scene that necessitated five years of fruitless, arduous hikes waiting for various metaphorical stars to align, from the height of the fog to the visibility of the overhanging galaxy.
    


            For all the beauty of South Africa's legislative capital, from the rolling fynbos (hills and plains) of Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden to the bioluminescent marine organisms that occasionally light up the nearby Kogel Bay beach, for Goetsch, few experiences beat the feeling of observing a budding photographer capture their first shot of the stars.
    


            “It's always exciting when you see it's someone's first time — the Milky Way comes up on the back of their screen and you see their faces,” he says.
    


            “I've got people that have been coming with me for seven or eight years now, and I've seen them grow. That's extremely rewarding for me as a photographer.”
    


            Goetsch's tutoring role is eased by the clarity with which the stars can often be seen from Cape Town and wider South Africa.
    


            In 2023, the country's tourism board published a 10-year national strategy outlining plans to become a world leader in astro-tourism, spurred by its relative scarcity of light pollution, favorable position in relation to various constellations (such as the Southern Cross and Mensa) and abundance of meteorite impact craters.
    


            It's already reaping rewards. In September 2025, Lapalala Wilderness Nature Reserve in Limpopo Province was designated as South Africa's first International Dark Sky Park by DarkSky, a nonprofit fighting against light pollution to preserve the quality of the night sky.
    


            Goetsch has worked on several occasions with the team at the Southern Africa Large Telescope (SALT) near Sutherland, in the Northern Cape, often being granted special access to shoot the observatories — and other gawking photographers — at night.
    


            “It's absolutely incredible to see these dark skies with the people sitting inside there taking pictures of the sky and, at the same time, you taking pictures of them,” Goetsch said. “It's quite surreal.”
    


            If there's a new moon in the sky, you can almost guarantee Goetsch will be somewhere pointing his lens toward it. Every star-spattered image he captures is another step toward his goal of showcasing southern Africa as a night photography paradise.
    


            “We see a lot of the Northern hemisphere photos of the Milky Way,” he explained, “So I really try and incorporate well-known locations or something that's very unique to southern Africa.”
    


            “I think we have one of the best places in the world to do night photography or astrophotography. Compared to the Northern hemisphere with a lot of light pollution, we're really lucky here … I'm so incredibly blessed to live in such a beautiful place.”

MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — The Australian government will not repatriate from Syria a group of 34 women and children with alleged ties to the militant Islamic State group, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Tuesday.

The women and children from 11 families were supposed to fly from Syria to Australia, but Syrian authorities on Monday turned them back to Roj detention camp because of procedural problems, officials said.

Only two groups of Australians have been repatriated with government help from Syrian camps since the fall of the Islamic State group in 2019. Other Australians have also returned without government assistance.

Albanese would not comment on a report that the latest women and children had Australian passports.

“We're providing absolutely no support and we are not repatriating people,” Albanese told Australian Broadcasting Corp. in Melbourne.

“We have no sympathy, frankly, for people who traveled overseas in order to participate in what was an attempt to establish a caliphate to undermine, destroy, our way of life. And so, as my mother would say, ‘You make your bed, you lie in it,'” Albanese added.

In his remarks, Albanese was referring to the IS militants' capture of wide swaths of land more than a decade ago that stretched across a third of Syria and Iraq, territory where the extremists established their so-called caliphate. 

At the height of its control, IS declared the city of Raqqa its capital, with jihadis from foreign countries traveling to Syria to join the IS. Over the years, they had families and raised children there. 

Opposition leader Angus Taylor demanded Albanese explain whether his government had considered banning the Australians from returning. So-called temporary exclusion orders enable a government minister to prevent high-risk citizens located overseas from returning to Australia for up to two years.

“These are individuals who chose to associate with a terrorist caliphate. This is not aligned with the values we as Australians believe in — democracy, the rule of law, our basic freedoms including freedom of religion,” Taylor told reporters.




“The door must be shut to people who do not believe in those things,” Taylor added.

Asked about using temporary exclusion orders in this case, Albanese did not directly answer. “What we will do on national security issues is we deal with it appropriately upon advice” of security agencies, Albanese told reporters.

Albanese noted that the child welfare-focused international charity Save the Children had failed to establish in Australia's courts that the Australian government had a responsibility to repatriate citizens from Syrian camps.

After the federal court ruled in the government's favor in 2024, Save the Children Australia chief executive Mat Tinkler argued the government had a moral, if not legal, obligation to repatriate families.

Albanese said if the latest group made their way to Australia without government help, they could be charged.

Under Australian law, it was an offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison to travel to Raqqa in Syria and elsewhere in the caliphate without a legitimate reason from 2014 to 2017. 

“It's unfortunate that children are impacted by this as well, but we are not providing any support. And if anyone does manage to find their way back to Australia, then they'll face the full force of the law, if any laws have been broken,” Albanese added.

The Islamic State group was defeated by a U.S.-led coalition in Iraq in 2017, and in Syria two years later, but IS sleeper cells still carry out deadly attacks in both countries. During the battles against IS, thousands of extremists and tens of thousands of women and children linked to them were taken to detention camps. 

Manager Hakmiyeh Ibrahim of the Roj camp in northeastern Syria told The Associated Press that relatives of the Australians said the Australian government had prepared the camp residents' passports and travel paperwork and suggested that their families collect those documents.

The last group of Australians to be repatriated from Syrian camps arrived in Sydney in October 2022.

They were four mothers, former partners of Islamic State supporters, and 13 children.

Australian officials had assessed the group as the most vulnerable among 60 Australian women and children held in Roj camp, the government said at the time.

Eight children of two slain Australian IS fighters were repatriated from Syria in 2019 by the conservative government that preceded Albanese's center-left Labor Party administration.

The issue of IS supporters resurfaced in Australia after the killings of 15 people at a Jewish festival at Bondi Beach on Dec. 14 — attackers allegedly inspired by IS.

Some countries are repatriating their citizens with alleged IS links from Syria while others are not. Iraq has repatriated most of its citizens, who accounted for the largest number of detainees, after Syrians. The United States, Germany, Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Canada have all repatriated citizens from Syrian camps.

Last year, families repatriated from Roj camp included German, British and French nationals.

Separately, thousands of accused IS militants who were held in detention centers in northeastern Syria have been transferred to Iraq by the U.S. military to stand trial there.

News anchor Anderson Cooper is ending his tenure on the CBS investigative series 60 Minutes.

After appearing on the program for nearly two decades, Cooper said in a statement announcing his resignation that ultimately he found it impossible to juggle his role at CBS with his job at CNN and his family life.

“Being a correspondent at 60 Minutes has been one of the great honors of my career. I got to tell amazing stories, and work with some of the best producers, editors, and camera crews in the business,” Cooper wrote in a statement about his departure. “For nearly twenty years, I've been able to balance my jobs at CNN and CBS, but I have little kids now and I want to spend as much time with them as possible, while they still want to spend time with me.”

Cooper is among the few high-profile journalists in broadcast television to hold lasting positions at two major networks at the same time. He joined 60 Minutes in 2007, while still maintaining his role as host of Anderson Cooper 360° on CNN.

Despite leaving CBS, Cooper will remain a host on CNN.

It is the latest in a series of shake-ups at the legacy news station since the arrival of Bari Weiss, who took over as editor-in-chief last October.

Under Weiss's leadership, the company has conducted several rounds of layoffs and buy-outs as it attempts to restructure and pivot toward the political center.

Weiss received internal pushback after choosing to hold a 60 Minutes program about conditions in El Salvador's megaprison, CECOT, demanding that reporters get comments from a White House official for the show.

The segment, which detailed inmates' accounts of “torture, sexual and physical abuse inside CECOT, one of El Salvador's harshest prisons,” eventually aired weeks later with few changes to its content.

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — The Dolphins released star receiver Tyreek Hill on Monday, ending the All-Pro's four-year tenure in Miami.

Hill, who turns 32 on March 1, is recovering from a season-ending injury suffered in a game against the New York Jets on Sept. 29 that required surgery to repair significant damage to his left knee, including a torn anterior cruciate ligament.

It is one of several major roster cuts the Dolphins made on Monday. Miami also cut offensive lineman James Daniels and receiver Nick Westbrook-Ikhine, and will release two-time Pro Bowl pass rusher Bradley Chubb.

The Dolphins acquired Hill in a trade with Kansas City ahead of the 2022 season and gave him a $120 million, four-year contract extension that made him the highest-paid player at his position at the time.

His contract, which runs through 2026, would have represented around $51 million against Miami's cap.

“These past few years have been some of the most meaningful of my life and career,” Hill said in an Instagram post Monday afternoon.

Hill had consecutive 1,700-yard receiving seasons in his first two years with Miami, including a league-leading 1,799 yards and 13 touchdowns in 2023. The five-time All-Pro entered the 2025 season aiming to regain that elite form after a relatively down year in 2024, when he had 81 catches for 959 yards — his lowest totals in both categories since 2019. 

He had 21 receptions for 265 yards before he was hurt while making a catch in Miami's Week 4 win against the Jets. Hill was running toward the sideline and planted his left foot, and his knee twisted as he was getting pulled down. He was carted off the field and placed on season-ending injured reserve on Oct. 1.




Hill's Dolphins tenure was characterized by tremendous production on the field coupled with numerous rocky moments off the field, including an altercation with police outside of Hard Rock Stadium ahead of the 2024 season opener, and pulling himself from that season's finale and later indicating he wanted to play elsewhere.

In an October podcast interview, Hill, who has played 10 NFL seasons, said he was undecided on whether he plans to retire when he's done rehabbing his injury, but on Monday he indicated on social media that he's not done playing yet.

“The Cheetah don't slow down. Ever,” Hill said in the post. “So to everyone wondering what's next...just wait on it. The Cheetah will be back...Born Again.”

Chubb spent the past three seasons with the Dolphins after being traded to Miami from Denver in 2022. 

He suffered a gruesome knee injury late in the 2023 season that required surgery to fix a torn anterior cruciate ligament, meniscus and patellar tendon in his right knee and sidelined him all of 2024. Chubb had 11 sacks — the most he had in a season since getting 12 as a rookie in 2018 — in 2023 before the injury.

Last season, Chubb's 8 1/2 sacks led the team. He represented a $31 million cap hit for 2026.

New general manager Jon Eric Sullivan, who was hired by the Dolphins last month along with head coach Jeff Hafley, was expected to begin making moves to overhaul Miami's roster.

“We will move with responsible aggression here,” Sullivan said when the Dolphins introduced him on Jan 22. “We will utilize every avenue of player acquisition to bolster this roster.”

Sullivan still faces the question on whether to move on from 2020 first-round pick Tua Tagovailoa, who was benched by former Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel toward the end of last season because of poor play.

Tagovailoa signed a four-year, $212.4 million extension in July 2024, but has since shown a decline in accuracy and mobility. Tagovailoa finished 2025 with 15 interceptions, second most in the NFL and a career high.

He is guaranteed $54 million for 2026, and the Dolphins would incur significant hits to the salary cap by releasing him. Cutting him would result in a $99 million dead cap charge. If the move is designated as a post-June 1 release, those charges are split over two years, with $67.4 million allocated to the 2026 cap and $31.8 million in 2027. 

Sullivan said last week at a fan event that he doesn't know “what the future holds right now.”

“And I told Tua that,” Sullivan said. “We're working through some things. What I can tell you is that we're going to infuse competition into that room — whether Tua is part of the room, whether he's not part of the room.”

Amazon shares whipsawed on Tuesday, as the stock attempted to make a comeback from a historic slide.

Should the stock close in the red, it would mark a 10th consecutive negative session, tying the company's longest streak of daily losses on record, which it notched in 1997. 

The nine-day slide reached Friday is the worst streak since 2006.

Amazon shares have lost roughly 18% of their value since Feb. 2, axing about $450 billion in market valuation as investors question the merits of its artificial intelligence spending plans.

The selling frenzy around Amazon is tied to the company's fourth-quarter earnings report released earlier this month.

Amazon said it expects to spend $200 billion in capital expenditures this year, a nearly 60% increase from last year and more than $50 billion above Wall Street's forecast. Most of the spending is expected to go to AI-related initiatives, which require more infrastructure such as data centers, chips and networking equipment. 

Investors have grown increasingly concerned about tech companies' hefty AI investments and their potential to shrink or erase free cash flows. 

Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon's capital expenditures could hit $700 billion this year as the companies race to build out more infrastructure. 

Alphabet stock slid more than 1% on Tuesday, while Microsoft and Meta shares were down less than a percent. Shares of Microsoft and Alphabet are both headed for their fifth straight negative session. 

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy defended the massive outlay, telling analysts in a conference call that he's confident it will "yield strong returns on invested capital." 

Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman has also sought to justify the spending increase, telling CNBC in an interview last week that the capex boost will allow the company to seize AI opportunities in the cloud.

Wedbush analysts wrote in a research note following Amazon's fourth-quarter report that the company is now in "prove it mode" to show investors it can deliver a return on capex spending. 

"The increase in spending will remain an overhang as investors digest the guide and will likely need to see more tangible returns before regaining comfort," the analysts wrote. 

The firm has an outperform rating on Amazon shares.

This Q&A is part of America: 250 Years Bold, a CNBC multiplatform series highlighting the leaders, institutions, and ideas that have shaped the United States over the past 250 years.

Dr. Rajiv J. Shah, president of The Rockefeller Foundation, leads one of the nation's most influential philanthropic institutions. Founded in 1913, the organization has invested more than $26 billion worldwide to advance public health, expand access to opportunity and tackle global challenges at scale. In this conversation, Shah reflects on the foundation's legacy — from pioneering breakthroughs in science and medicine to shaping modern philanthropy — and discusses how its mission continues to evolve to address inequality, strengthen resilience and expand economic opportunity in the United States and around the world.

Dr. Rajiv J. Shah: John D. Rockefeller Sr. was a titan. He built America during the Industrial Revolution, and helped, together with others, create the modern country we have. He was one of the pioneers who shaped that economic transformation that gave us railways and automobiles and gasoline and the power to go about improving our quality of life. In doing so he, of course, went from being someone who came from modest resources to the world's wealthiest individual, and decided he would use that wealth to give back to society and help shape a future that was hopeful and optimistic, not just for the winners of that age, but for everybody.

Shah: The Rockefeller Foundation was created in 1913, although long before that, John D. Rockefeller, when he was 16 years old and got his first job, started tithing to his church. He was a devout Baptist who believed in charitable giving. When he created the foundation, he did it with a partner, Frederick Gates, who was his advisor and an early trustee, and they decided the foundation would be used specifically to invest in those areas where science and innovation could transform life on this planet.

Shah: The Rockefeller Foundation was established more than 100 years ago to take on major global projects that would transform life and the nature of opportunity for the world's most vulnerable people. We were founded to do scientific philanthropy because John D. Rockefeller believed that science applied to health, agriculture, energy and even social sciences applied to governance could really help transform society and make it an environment where everyone flourishes, not just the select few. The very first big project the foundation took on was eradicating hookworm in the American South. They built a reference lab, they created the county-based American public health system, and they successfully eradicated hookworm. Went on to tackle malaria, and that process created both huge successes in modern public health, but also seeded the American public health system county by county across this country, and presented the antecedents of the Centers for Disease Control based in Atlanta.

Shah: We focus today on bringing science, innovation and partnership to lift up vulnerable populations across the planet. We have four major areas of work and investment — health, food, energy and jobs — and we engage in large-scale public-private partnerships to deliver those outcomes. We invest all the time in core science around food, nutrition, energy, energy storage, battery technology, things that we think can make a difference, especially for those people who are vulnerable across this planet. One example of a risk we took is we issued a social impact bond, raised $500 million and put that entire amount of capital into one project to help make sure we could get more people out of energy poverty using renewable energy technologies. Today, we've mobilized more than $50 billion to reach more than 300 million people with energy access in Africa through an initiative we call "Mission 300."

Shah: America has always been a frontier nation, and when John D. Rockefeller created the Rockefeller Foundation, it was during a time of economic transformation. Our history teaches us we can innovate and partner and collaborate and solve the challenges we face. My parents came here in the late 1960s as immigrants from India. I was raised to understand almost every day at the dinner table that America is a country where, if you worked hard and played by the rules, you and your kids would get a chance to thrive. What has changed is that today fewer than half of America's kids are predicted to do better than their parents, and so we need to recreate a pathway to the American Dream for kids across this country that we are otherwise leaving behind. That's the mission of the Rockefeller Foundation going forward.

Veteran broadcaster Anderson Cooper said Monday that he is leaving his role as a correspondent on CBS News' "60 Minutes" after nearly 20 years.

In a statement, Cooper said he intended to spend more time focusing on his CNN gig, and his family.

His exit comes at an already turbulent time for CBS News under its new editor in chief, Bari Weiss.

Here are what some of the leading voices in media are saying about Cooper's "60 Minutes" departure.

Sports broadcaster Keith Olbermann shared the news about Cooper's departure on his Bluesky account, posting: "Anderson Cooper has left the sinking ship that is Idiot Bari Weiss's New Stormfront CBS."

Olbermann later added, "Now, people will only be able to NOT watch AC on cnn."

Cooper has worked at CNN since 2001, where he is a political commentator and hosts the "Anderson Cooper 360" show.

Brian Lowry, a longtime media columnist and current Hollywood correspondent at Status News, a media newsletter, wrote on X: "Have worked around Hollywood long enough to know nobody ever really leaves a job to spend more time with their family."

Tom Jones, senior media writer at The Poynter Report, wrote in his newsletter that Cooper's departure marked "the end of a journalism era."

Jones said that Cooper's exit "certainly adds more uncertainty in a news division that is very much in flux under relatively new editor-in-chief Bari Weiss."

He added: "It also raises questions about '60 Minutes,' the previous gold standard of TV news shows." 

Lydia Polgreen, a New York Times opinion writer and the former editor in chief of HuffPost, posted to X on Tuesday: "I don't watch much TV news, but @andersoncooper is in a league of his own as a television journalist. A huge loss for 60 Minutes."

CNN's chief media analyst, Brian Stelter, wrote in his "Reliable Sources" newsletter Tuesday that there are open questions about which other correspondents might leave, "and on what terms."

"The risk is obvious: Loyal '60 Minutes' viewers will leave along with the correspondents they like to watch," Stelter said.

Six-time NBA Champion Los Angeles Lakers owner Jeanie Buss said new majority owner Mark Walter's access to capital will help the team best compete with the NBA's top franchises — and that her late father, Jerry Buss, would have supported the sale. 

"What was important to him was that the Lakers stay at the top of the NBA, and to stay at the top of the NBA, you need to have the resources," Buss said. "You need to have everybody pulling together. And he would want [that for] the Lakers, because the Lakers are his legacy."

While the NBA has a salary cap that can limit team spend, franchises do have some flexibility if owners are willing to pay a luxury tax. Team spend per season currently ranges from about $154 million to $220 million, with the Lakers seventh overall at $197 million, according to Basketball Reference. Walter has consistently been one of the top spending owners in Major League Baseball since acquiring the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2012. 

Buss and her family agreed to sell their majority stake in the team to Walter last year at a $10 billion valuation. ESPN recently documented significant conflict between the Buss siblings that led to the sale, which Buss called "bittersweet." 

Jerry Buss willed ownership of the team to his six children in a trust when he died in 2013.

"My siblings were involved in the decision that was made," Jeanie Buss said. "It's about the Lakers and the greatness and what the fans expect, and you need resources and you need a direction. I think it's fair to say that my family — we all have our different opinions and [are] living our lives, choosing what we want to do with our time, and this was the best decision for all six of us."

The Buss family kept about 15% of the team, and Jeanie Buss agreed to stay on as governor for at least five years. Still, when asked if she plans to stay for the full term, Buss seemingly hedged her answer. 

"That's what I agreed to," Buss said. "Mark Walter and I are very comfortable with the way things are set up. And I expect things to go on and be successful. And you know, I'm not going anywhere."

Buss acknowledged the past 12 months have been one of transition for the team, given both the sale and the team's decision to trade star forward Anthony Davis for Luka Dončić about a year ago. Buss said the team's focus is now on building around Dončić, rather than 41-year-old LeBron James, who has been the face of the team since he joined in 2018.

"The partnership will give us the stability to continue to move forward as we build towards a team around Dončić," Buss said. "We couldn't be more proud that he is a Laker. He is a young all-star that the fans love to see."

James said Sunday he's still unsure whether he'll play beyond this season. Buss said she'd leave James' future with the Lakers to James. Still, she sounded doubtful that he would return to the team next season, either because he would retire or because he would choose to play elsewhere.

"Never say never, but you know, he certainly hasn't given an indication," said Buss. "He's earned the right to decide how his career will go, and you know, he continues to impress."

Buss also discussed her tequila brand, Cincoro, created in 2016 when five friendly competitors met for dinner around an NBA board of governors meetings, bonding over their shared passion for tequila. That group included Buss; then-Charlotte Hornets owner Michael Jordan; Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Wes Edens; and former Boston Celtics co-owner Wyc Grousbeck and his wife, Emilia Fazzalari.

"We all had a mutual appreciation for tequila," Buss said. "And us being a very competitive group, we thought, 'You know what? We could probably make one better.' And so, that night, Cincoro was born."

Jordan, known for being a fierce competitor on the court, isn't any different behind the scenes and is deeply involved in the business, Buss said. 

"I knew he was a tough competitor because his first championship, he beat the Los Angeles Lakers," she said. "He's just like that in the boardroom. It's, 'Who are we up against? Let's be better than that. Let's work harder. Let's be more creative.'"

Jordan brought in his design team, resulting in a distinctive bottle that Buss called "a work of art."

"When you work with Michael Jordan, the bar is set high," she said. "Not just him as a player, but him as a businessman. And we've seen he's been pretty darn successful."

Cincoro is now a sponsor of the Los Angeles Lakers, and Buss unveiled Tuesday a limited-edition añejo bottle in Lakers purple and gold. Buss said it's a nod to both the franchise's championship pedigree and the brand's premium positioning.

Venture capitalists are doubling down on Render, a startup offering easy-to-use cloud infrastructure. On Tuesday it said it has raised $100 million in funding at a $1.5 billion valuation.

The lucrative cloud computing world, dominated by Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet, has become more competitive since the arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT assistant in 2022. Companies such as CoreWeave that rent out Nvidia graphics cards for training artificial intelligence models have grown into mature businesses. Meanwhile, people are asking AI models to write software for them, and seeking advice on where to run the new programs. 

Render is among the beneficiaries of this emerging dynamic. Its revenue growth is well above 100%, and more than 4.5 million developers use its tools, Anurag Goel, its co-founder and CEO, told CNBC in an interview. 

The startup was founded in 2018 and is based in San Francisco, with about 100 employees. Investors include 01A, Addition, Bessemer Venture Partners, General Catalyst and Georgian Partners. With the new capital, Render will hire additional technical staff members to build features. 

Render runs its software on Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. Recently, Render has also been testing the use of its own servers. Expanding the initiative might reduce Render's costs and yield lower prices.

"We get more control over the kinds of things we can do, but the cost basis is just very different," said Goel, who was the eighth employee at Stripe, the payment processor.

But greater reliance on in-house computing power brings new risks, because the company must ensure that it always has enough servers on hand. If the strategy works out, it could boost efficiency for customers, such as Alibaba, CBS, Hodinkee, Paradigm, Shopify and AI-fueled app builder Base44.

The founder of Base44, Maor Shlomo, had used AWS at his previous startup, Explorium, and this time he wanted something different. 

"I was all by myself, and so I was searching for services that can automate most of the stuff so that I don't need to deal with infrastructure, even if it will cost slightly more that," Shlomo said. He signed up for Render. 

After website builder Wix bought Base44 last June, Shlomo asked to invest in Render, given his experience. Now he's a shareholder and a customer.

"It's such a great product that we don't need someone that's focused only on Render," he said.

Before Render, there was Heroku, a pioneer of the platform as a service category that runs on top of AWS. Salesforce acquired it for about $217 million in 2011. Earlier this month, Salesforce said it was backing away from developing new features for Heroku.

"People now know that they're not going to add new features to it, so they're looking around for the most mature alternative," Goel said.

OpenAI — which has committed to spending more than $600 billion with the Amazon, Cerebras, CoreWeave, Microsoft and Oracle clouds in recent months — uses Render. The AI lab's Codex coding app allows people to deploy web apps they create on Render. Codex users can also choose to deploy their apps on Cloudflare, Netlify and Vercel. In September, Vercel said it raised capital at a $9.3 billion valuation. Goel said companies such as AI spreadsheet specialist Shortcut have moved to Render from Vercel.

It doesn't hurt that ChatGPT recommends that people consider Render in certain scenarios, Goel said.

"Chatbots have effectively, almost singlehandedly, grown our business," he said.

Even as experts anticipate more supply in the used car market this year, consumers probably won't see much relief on pricing.

While dealer inventories continue to slowly improve, the higher-cost mix of vehicles hitting the used car market — and wholesale prices that ticked higher in January — could limit how much that added supply translates into cheaper cars.

Although the consumer price index shows that prices for used cars were down 1.8% in January from December and 2% from a year earlier, they're easing off record highs. The average price of a used car up to 8 years old was $30,202 in 2025, up 27.6% from $23,668 in 2020, according to J.D. Power.

"The affordable under-$20,000 vehicles are harder to find," said Jonathan Banks, a vice president with J.D. Power.

That's likely to remain the case even as inventory improves. "You'll see a richer mix of vehicles," Banks said. "That's just the reality of it."

The share of under-$20,000 cars was 30% in 2025, down from 53% in 2019, according to J.D. Power.

Because consumers have been hanging on to their cars for longer, today's higher prices may be a bit of a shock for them, Banks said.

"A lot of people will be coming into the market when they haven't been there in a long time," he said.

Although used car prices have eased, they remain elevated against a backdrop of a broader household affordability crunch. Many consumers are already struggling to keep up with high costs for everyday things like housing, groceries and insurance premiums.

Compared with the average price paid for a new car — $49,191, according to Kelley Blue Book — the used car market may be the more desirable option.

However, the cost of financing a used car is also a pain point. Interest rates generally are higher compared with those that apply to new car loans, which can be especially costly for consumers with poor credit. 

For credit scores ranging from 501 to 600, the average interest rate for used car loans was 19% in the third quarter of 2025, according to Experian. That's compared with an average of 7.43% for consumers with a score of 781 to 850.

The average amount financed for a used vehicle in January was $29,364 and the average interest rate was 10.5%, according to Edmunds. 

If that amount were financed at that interest rate over 72 months — the average is 69.7 months — the monthly payment would be $551, and the interest paid over the full life of the loan would be $10,339, according to Bankrate's auto loan calculator. That would push the total amount paid for the car to $39,703.

Separately, a small but growing share of consumers are taking out used car loans with a monthly payment of $1,000 or more, according to Edmunds. In the final quarter of 2025, 6.3% of buyers committed to a payment of that amount, compared with 6.1% in the third quarter and 5.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The variety of available used vehicles reflects what's been purchased in the new car market over time. Consumers have preferred SUVs and trucks over sedans for years. Last year, sedans accounted for just 17% of the new car market, according to Edmunds. In 2015, that share was above 40%.

A greater number of vehicles are coming off of three-year leases this year compared with last year due to higher lease volume in 2023 than in 2022, said Ivan Drury, director of insights for Edmunds. Additionally, a growing number of fleet vehicles — for example, rental cars — should hit the used car market this year as that supply also continues recovering from pandemic-era disruptions.

As carmakers boost the number of deals they're offering on new autos, used car shoppers may benefit as well, Drury said. "When we start to see discounts on the new cars, it trickles down to used cars," he said.

If it's been a while since you bought a vehicle, brush up on the best strategies for buying a used car. 

"Do your due diligence," Banks said. Some strategies he recommends:

Figma is partnering with Anthropic and launching a feature called "Code to Canvas" that converts code generated in artificial intelligence tools like Claude Code into fully editable designs inside Figma.

The feature, announced Tuesday, creates a bridge between AI coding tools and Figma's process, allowing users who have built working interfaces by prompting an AI agent to bring it directly into Figma's canvas.

There, teams can refine it, compare options side by side and align on design decisions.

The move reflects a broader bet that agentic coding tools like Claude Code haven't eliminated the need for design, and made it more essential. But the risk is that Figma is building a better on-ramp to a highway it no longer controls. 

Watch our exclusive conversation with Figma CEO Dylan Field at 9:30 a.m. PT/12 p.m. ET at this link.

If AI tools keep improving, teams may eventually skip the design refinement step altogether.

Anthropic's products have been at the center of a massive sell-off in software as a service stocks that traders on Wall Street have dubbed the "SaaSpocalypse."

The iShares software ETF has fallen into bear market territory. Names like Salesforce, ServiceNo, and Intuit have taken double-digit hits.

Figma has been caught in the downdraft.

The stock has fallen dramatically since its IPO last summer, swept up in the same indiscriminate selling that has punished anything with a SaaS business model. The company reports earnings on Wednesday after the market close.

Figma stock is down about 85% from the 52-week high of $142.92 that it reached in August.

The restaurant investors behind the success of Dave's Hot Chicken are making a new nationwide bet on the next-hottest restaurant trend: birria.

Mike's Red Tacos, a San Diego-based birria chain with just two locations, plans to announce on Tuesday a new franchising initiative that will build hundreds of restaurants across the U.S., with support from early-stage backers Bill Phelps and Andrew Feghali, CNBC can report. 

Financial terms of their investment, which took place in early 2025, were not disclosed.

"We just saw that this was a brand and a concept that really had legs to it," Phelps told CNBC. "And then the critical thing is, we brought down prospective franchisees. ... Everyone gave it the thumbs up."

Phelps said he had never heard of birria before Feghali introduced him to Mike's.

Traditional birria is a beef or goat stew, slow cooked with spices and chiles to give the meat lots of flavor. Birria tacos, like those sold at Mike's, use the slow-cooked meat as a filling and usually include a consomme on the side as a dip for the taco. 

Once known as a regional Mexican food, birria now appears on 3.7% of U.S. menus, according to Datassential. That's more than quadruple its menu penetration four years ago, based on the firm's data, but there's still a long runway before it reaches ubiquity.

Mexican-inspired fast-food brands such as Qdoba, El Pollo Loco, Del Taco and even Taco Bell have released their own versions of birria. And there's at least 478 restaurant operators running birria-focused restaurants, according to Datassential.

Mike's menu also includes burritos, loaded nachos and fries, and birria ramen.

"It appeals to a very broad range of guests — it's not just your millennials and Gen Zs," Phelps said, speaking about the customers in Mike's Red Tacos restaurants. "There's older people in the restaurant, there's little kids, so it's got a very, very broad appeal."

Phelps co-founded Wetzel's Pretzels in 1994 and became a founding investor in Blaze Pizza, the fast-casual pizza chain founded by Elise and Rick Wetzel. In 2019, Phelps joined Dave's Hot Chicken as an investor and CEO, using franchising to expand the chain quickly to hundreds of restaurants worldwide. Last year, private equity firm Roark Capital bought a majority stake in Dave's Hot Chicken in deal worth roughly $1 billion.

Feghali was one of the first franchisees of Dave's Hot Chicken. He is also one of the nation's largest Little Caesars operators. 

Together, Feghali and Phelps founded Four Wall Partners, a restaurant franchising investment firm. In addition to being early-stage investors in Mike's, they will act as advisors and members of the chain's board. 

Vincent Montanelli, who most recently served as chief executive of Wetzel's, has joined Mike's to serve as president.

Founded originally as a food truck five years ago, Mike's Red Tacos opened its first brick-and-mortar location in 2022. Founder Mike Touma plans to open his third location in March; he'll stay on with the company as a board member and franchisee of the chain's San Diego locations.

"We put together a deal where [Touma is] going to keep the rights to his stores and future stores in San Diego, and then we're going to franchise it across the rest of the U.S. and internationally," Phelps said.

The new team plans to follow the established playbook used by Wetzel's and Dave's to grow Mike's Red Tacos quickly.

"We're going to be very aggressive where we grow with this, because we've seen that we can do that," Phelps said.

The taco chain has already secured franchising development deals with multi-unit operators for more than 200 locations nationwide, from California to Texas to New England. Some of those franchised restaurants could open as soon as the end of the year.

Phelps anticipates stiff competition from national chains and local taco restaurants alike. However, he said he thinks that the chain's simple menu, delicious food and an aggressive marketing strategy can help Mike's overtake rivals. 

"We think this can be a winner," Phelps said.

Iran partially closed the strategically vital Strait of Hormuz on Tuesday, state media reported, citing "security precautions" as Tehran's Revolutionary Guard conducts military drills in the waterway.

It comes as the U.S. and Iran hold talks in the Swiss city of Geneva, seeking to resolve an ongoing dispute over Tehran's nuclear program.

It marks the first time Iran has shut parts of the Strait of Hormuz, a major international waterway that links crude producers in the Middle East with key markets across the globe, since U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Tehran with military action in January.

Located in the gulf between Oman and Iran, the strait is recognized as one of the world's most important oil choke points.

About 13 million barrels per day of crude oil transited the Strait of Hormuz in 2025, accounting for roughly 31% of global seaborne crude flows, data provided by market intelligence firm Kpler showed.

Tuesday's temporary closure of the waterway was aimed at ensuring shipping safety as part of the Revolutionary Guard's "Smart Control of the Strait of Hormuz" drill. The exercise is designed to improve Iran's operational readiness and bolster its deterrence, among other objectives.

Iran and the U.S. reached an understanding of the "guiding principles" during the talks, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told reporters after they concluded, Reuters reported. 

The progress does not mean an agreement will be reached soon and more work still needs to be done, he added.

Energy market participants had been closely watching the outcome of the U.S.-Iran talks, particularly as both sides have increased their military presence in the region.

Oil prices were last seen trading lower, erasing earlier gains. International benchmark Brent crude futures with April delivery fell 1.8% to $67.48 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures with March delivery stood 0.4% lower at $62.65 

Jakob Larsen, chief safety and security officer at Bimco, which represents global shipowners, said the temporary closure of the Strait of Hormuz was likely to cause "minor nuisance and delays" to inbound shipping headed for the Persian Gulf — but no major disruptions.

"The exercise establishes a live firing exercise area overlapping the inbound part of Strait of Hormuz's Traffic Separation Scheme, and requests that shipping keeps clear of the area for the duration of a few hours," Larsen said.

"Given the level of tension in the area, it is expected that commercial shipping will comply with the Iranian request to keep clear of the exercise area," he added.

It's the end of the world as software companies know it, and this CEO feels fine.

Judging by what some AI experts are saying, and the state of the stock market, you'd think software companies were on their last legs. Basware CEO Jason Kurtz, whose company sells software for financial processes, sees it slightly differently.

"I will tell you there is not a single piece of data that we see that says that," said Kurtz.

"I have not had a single customer tell us, 'Oh, we're just going to go figure this out on our own and do AP with OpenAI or whoever.' That's not the way these companies work," he added.

Kurtz reached out to me last week after I asked for some reader feedback on the topic. (I genuinely read all your emails. Even the mean ones!)

Basware, which counts Mercedes and Heineken among its roughly 6,500 customers and uses AI within its own products, hasn't felt threatened thus far. Kurtz told me the company saw a 20% year-over-year increase in sales in 2025, primarily driven by a surge in the back-half of the year.

He acknowledged that there had been some customer chatter about experimenting with AI on their own. But more recently, clients just want results.

Kurtz recalled a conversation with the digital transformation officer of a large European company. After spending roughly a million euros on internal AI-related projects in finance over the past year, the executive told Kurtz they "can't point to a single penny that we have saved, earned, or helped our business in any way."

"I'm tired of experimenting. I want people who know how to use AI in our processes in our workflows," Kurtz said the executive told him.

I asked Kurtz for advice for fellow software companies looking to protect themselves.

Basware primarily works with AWS to help build its AI tools for customers. The company also has an "AI czar," according to Kurtz, to surveil the industry. Figuring out ways to implement AI into your own products that'll drive more value for customers is one way to stay ahead.

There's also strength in numbers. Kurtz said maintaining tight integrations with fellow vendors to become a part of the workflow creates stickiness.

"If we weren't doing that, I'd be even more paranoid," Kurtz said.

And then there's the data element. Basware has processed 2.5 billion invoices and 10 trillion euros of spend in the company's 40-year history. Having such a large swath of info can help train models and identify new efficiencies to pitch to customers.

"If you don't have a data strategy around AI and how you're going to use that to differentiate your AI and your capabilities, I think that's going to be a challenge," he said.

Happy Tuesday, and happy Year of the Horse! I'm back after a week in Costa Rica, where I sampled coffee, memorized the USD-colón conversion rate and wished my Spanish was better.

S&P 500 futures are lower this morning. The stock market is coming off a losing week.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Wall Street didn't go into the holiday weekend on a winning note. While the latest inflation data came in cooler than expected, it wasn't enough to spark a recovery rally that could mitigate steep recent losses.

Here's what to know:

Rev. Jesse Jackson died today at 84 years old, his family confirmed in a statement. The civil rights icon and Baptist minister was a Martin Luther King Jr. protégé and two-time Democratic presidential candidate.

While a college student, Jackson was a crusader in the fight against Jim Crow segregation laws. He became a central figure in the broader civil rights movement, known for his work on the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Rainbow PUSH coalition.

"Our father was a servant leader — not only to our family, but to the oppressed, the voiceless, and the overlooked around the world," his family said in their statement. "We shared him with the world, and in return, the world became part of our extended family. His unwavering belief in justice, equality, and love uplifted millions, and we ask you to honor his memory by continuing the fight for the values he lived by."

Hyatt Hotels Chair Thomas Pritzker became the latest business mogul to step down from his position over ties to the late sex predator Jeffrey Epstein.

Pritzker said in a statement released yesterday that he held "regret" over his relationship with Epstein and that he "exercised terrible judgment in maintaining contact." The 75-year-old, who had been chair for more than two decades, said he'd resign from his post immediately and not seek reelection to the board.

With that announcement, Pritzker joined a growing list of business and political leaders leaving their positions as more details about Epstein's business dealings come to light. Goldman Sachs Legal Chief Kathryn Ruemmler and Paul Weiss Chair Brad Karp are among the latest corporate executives to resign.

Tech moguls are descending on India for an artificial intelligence summit this week, with OpenAI's Sam Altman, Alphabet's Sundar Pichai and Anthropic's Dario Amodei all expected to attend. Nvidia's Jensen Huang reportedly pulled out due to "unforeseen circumstances."

Altman announced over the weekend that Peter Steinberger, creator of the viral AI agent OpenClaw, is joining OpenAI. The news came as competition among generative AI firms heats up. OpenAI rival Anthropic saw its daily active user base grow 11% following its Super Bowl ad campaign that took a swipe at the ChatGPT maker.

Apple is entering the video podcasting realm. The tech giant announced yesterday that it would debut an integrated video podcasting experience in the spring.

As CNBC's Zach Vallese reports, this brings Apple's offerings closer to those of Spotify, YouTube and Netflix — all of which have leaned into video podcasting. Listeners will be able to toggle between watching or listening to shows in the Apple Podcasts app, and download video versions for offline viewing.

Meanwhile, Snap announced the launch of creator subscriptions as it aims to diversify revenue beyond ads. Creators on the ap will be able to earn income directly from their most loyal followers through paid memberships in a model similar to that of Patreon and Substack.

Here's what we're keeping an eye on in this holiday-shortened trading week:

CNBC's Sean Conlon, Jeff Cox, Sarah Min, Dan Mangan, Lola Murti, Dylan Butts, Ashley Capoot, Samantha Subin, Zach Vallese and Annika Kim Constantino contributed to this report. Josephine Rozzelle edited this edition.

After an incredible three weeks traveling around Brazil, I was on the first leg of my flight home to Chicago when I received a message from my director at work — a 15-minute "check-in" with an HR representative.

Worried I might receive news of a layoff, I frantically deboarded the plane after landing in Rio de Janeiro and joined the call in a quiet corner of the duty-free section of the airport. There, I was informed that my role had been eliminated.

Faced with the reality of returning home to the frigid Chicago temperatures with no job, I quickly changed my connecting flight and decided to hostel-hop around Brazil for another month.

However, even that extra month didn't feel like long enough in the country I'd fallen in love with. Exploring beautiful destinations while practicing a new language every day was incredibly fulfilling for me.

Once I went back to the US, I realized I was looking for ways to push myself out of my comfort zone. I had always wanted to live abroad, and my unemployment seemed like the perfect alignment to make that move to another part of the world.

So, a few months after my original trip, I relocated from Chicago to São Paulo and was greeted by lots of surprises along the way.

Growing up in the Midwest, I've endured my fair share of snowstorms and wind chills so cold that I felt as though my eyelids would freeze together. So, I felt well-equipped for any kind of cold weather Mother Nature could ever throw my way.

Even so, I wasn't prepared for just how chilly Brazil could feel — especially during a springtime cold front while living in an area without access to central heating.

Although Brazil's springtime temperatures (which last from September through November) are similar to what I experienced during the Chicago fall, it was difficult to adjust to the lack of central heating. So, I found myself wearing multiple layers of T-shirts and the only hoodie I brought with me.

Before I moved, I'd only visited Brazil during its smoldering summer months, so I had naively assumed the subtropical temperatures in São Paulo would be pleasant year-round.

Between seeing unrefrigerated milk in grocery stores to trying vegetables I've never heard of, the day-to-day food in Brazil is a lot different than what I was used to in the States.

For example, contrary to the common American adage, breakfast doesn't seem to be the most important meal of the day here; many Brazilians opt for bread or fruit instead of the hefty pancakes or sausage links I was accustomed to.

For lunch and dinner, many locals seem to rely on a tried-and-true formula: arroz (rice), feijão (beans), some meat, and salad.

Classic dishes like stroganoff (a creamy chicken or beef dish topped with crispy shoestring potatoes) or feijoada (pork and black bean stew) may enter the rotation. Still, the aforementioned combo is a popular default dish that I've grown to love.

Although tavern-style Chicago pizza still holds a special place in my heart, my new Brazilian favorites include acarajé (stuffed black-eyed pea fritters fried in dendé oil), acerola (a sweet cherry fruit), and doce de leite (sweet caramelized milk used as a topping or filling).

Plus, there's a pretty great international food scene here, too. While wandering around the city, I've come across a wide range of cuisines, from Lebanese and West African restaurants to Colombian and Venezuelan spots.

One thing I've noticed since my first visit to the country is that Brazilians are very proud to be Brazilian.

From football matches to the celebrations that occur when Brazilian films are nominated for Academy Awards, the people here seem to be the loudest and proudest fans in the room.

Because of this, I was worried I might not feel as welcome as an outsider. Instead, I've found an endearing level of curiosity among many Brazilians I've met, who either want to practice English or ask how I'm enjoying their beloved country.

This openness to connect has softened a lot of the original culture shock during my move. Although very different from my life in Chicago, I'm excited to continue building a life for myself in São Paulo.

Larry and David Ellison are getting another shot to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.

The media conglomerate announced Tuesday that it will let the Ellisons make another bid for the company over the next week, with two key stipulations: Their offer has to be more than $31 for each share of WBD, and it will be the last time the Ellisons get to make a formal pitch to the WBD board.

WBD's announcement reopens a deal that was theoretically closed last December, when it agreed to sell most of itself to Netflix in an $83 billion transaction.

Since then, the Ellisons, who bought Paramount last year and want to merge it with WBD, have argued that their offer of $30 per share — for the entire company — was better than Netflix's offer.

They have repeatedly told WBD and its investors that they should get another shot at making their case. Their most recent pitch came a week ago, when they offered to pay billions more in fees — including a $2.8 billion penalty WBD would owe Netflix if it walks away from its existing deal — and dangled the prospect of raising the per-share price they'd pay if the deal didn't close by the end of 2026.

Now, WBD says, they have one more opportunity to bid. WBD says they expect the Ellisons to increase their offer to more than $31 a share. The company is trading around $28 a share, up 170% in the last year.

In a press release, WBD officials say that last week, a "senior representative" for Paramount told them that if they had the chance to bid, they would offer $31 per share, but could go above that.

None of this means the existing deal Netflix has with WBD goes away. For starters, WBD continues to formally endorse its Netflix deal. More important: If Paramount does increase its bid, Netflix will have the ability to raise its offer, too.

And no matter what bid WBD eventually agrees to, the deal will still need regulatory approval in the US and overseas. Netflix got a preview of some of the issues regulators might bring up earlier this month during a congressional hearing, when Republicans argued that the company is too woke, and Democrats worried that a combined Netflix/WBD could doom the movie industry.

A Paramount/WBD combination would also get regulatory scrutiny, though the Ellisons are counting on their ties to the Trump White House to give them a leg up.

Snap is introducing a subscription feature that will allow creators to earn recurring income directly from their most engaged fans, as the social media company works to diversify beyond advertising.

The Los Angeles company will begin testing "Creator Subscriptions," as the feature is called, on Monday, starting with a small cohort of Snapchat creators, the company told CNBC exclusively. With user growth moderating, Snap's expansion into paid creator subscriptions emphasizes the company's initiative to grow income beyond advertising and build more predictable revenue streams. 

"In the year ahead, growth in subscribers will be a critical input metric to track our progress," Snap CEO Evan Spiegel wrote earlier this month as part of the company's fourth-quarter results. 

Snap's existing subscription offerings, Snapchat+ and Memories Storage Plans, grew 71% year over year to reach 24 million users in the period. However, the company reported 474 million daily active users, down 3 million from the previous quarter. 

With the upcoming feature, Snapchat users will be able to pay to subscribe to their favorite creators and receive exclusive content, including direct photos or videos, as well as access a subscriber-only Story and send text-based replies that can be featured at the top of a creator's public Story.

"We want the next step in our long-term creator monetization journey to be one that's really rooted in real relationships," said Jim Shepherd, Snap's head of content partnerships, in an interview with CNBC. "And help creators expand the ways that they make money in a way that's predictable and they can make money from their most engaged fans."

Snap is entering an increasingly crowded market for direct-to-fan subscriptions. 

Platforms like Patreon, Substack and OnlyFans are built around paid memberships, while major social media companies have introduced their own in-app subscription tools. In 2018, Google's YouTube started offering Channel Memberships, where creators receive 70% of membership revenue after taxes and fees are deducted, with transaction costs covered by the company. In 2020 and 2022, respectively, Meta's Facebook and Instagram began allowing creators to offer subscriptions, and Meta currently lets them keep 100% of subscription revenue after fees, according to company's website.

On Snapchat, creators will be able to set their own subscription price within a range of $4.99 to $19.99 per month. After platform fees, creators will receive approximately 60% of subscription revenue. Snap said it will provide creators with performance data to help guide pricing decisions as the product evolves beyond its initial test phase.

Snap's initial group includes 15 creators to start, with roughly 10 more expected in the U.S. during the early test phase. The company said outreach is also underway in Canada, the U.K. and France. Participants include popular creators like David Dobrik, Catherine Paiz, Harry Jowsey, Jeremiah Brown and Skai Jackson.

"We've built a place where their income feels really rewarding, consistent, sustainable," Shepherd said. Creators "consistently say that it's a great place where they can make a living by being themselves."

Creators on Snapchat currently earn revenue through ads in Stories and Spotlight under the company's Unified Monetization Program as well as through brand partnerships.

Shepherd said that Snap's advantage lies in distribution and discovery through the company's Spotlight feature, which shows users short-form videos from other users on the app.

"We have a built-in distribution engine where so many creators are building fandoms," Shepherd said. 

Over the coming weeks, the feature will be available for users in eligible countries using Apple iOS devices. Creators Subscriptions will not be available for Android users initially, and the company did not say when that will change.

Business Insider Edition 

Somalia has officially joined the East African Community (EAC) passport system, becoming the bloc's sixth member to issue the regional travel document. The move is expected to ease cross-border movement, boost trade, and strengthen regional integration.


        The approval was handed over on Tuesday in Dar es Salaam during a ceremony attended by Somalia's ambassador to Tanzania and the EAC, Ilyas Ali Hassan, Internal Security Minister Abdullahi Sheikh Ismail, and Immigration Director General Mustafa Dhuhulow.
    


        The ambassador formally handed over the authorisation document, giving Somalia the green light to produce a passport recognised across all EAC member states.



        Issuance of the East African e-Passport began in 2017 as member states moved to modernise regional travel documents. Kenya led the rollout on September 1, 2017, followed by Tanzania (January 31, 2018), Burundi (May 31, 2018), Uganda (December 18, 2018) and Rwanda (July 1, 2019).
    


        South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are still implementing the system.
    


        “This is a key moment for Somalia and its engagement with regional institutions,” Ilyas said. “The handover reflects ongoing efforts to align Somalia's travel systems with EAC standards. This marks another milestone in facilitating the movement of EAC citizens.”
    


        With the green light, Somalia can now begin technical and administrative preparations for producing the passport. This includes aligning its immigration systems with regional standards, establishing printing processes, and coordinating recognition procedures with partner states once issuance begins.
    


        The development comes a day after Somalia and Tanzania signed a memorandum of understanding on immigration cooperation, introducing visa-on-arrival for holders of diplomatic and service passports and simplifying entry for ordinary travellers under agreed conditions.
    


        Officials said the framework will reduce administrative barriers while promoting trade, education, and professional exchanges.
    


        The MoU also establishes coordination channels between immigration authorities, including information-sharing, implementation reviews, and mechanisms to resolve operational challenges, ensuring smoother cross-border mobility.

        In a country where millions search daily for how to sell bitcoin in Nigeria or check the bitcoin to naira rate today, speed and trust have become the real currency. Monica Cash has now surpassed ₦500 billion in total transactions, marking three years of sustained growth and reinforcing its position as the best crypto app in Nigeria for users who demand instant conversions, secure payments, and complete financial control within one seamless platform.
    


        Over the past three years, Monica Cash has evolved from a focused crypto conversion tool into a comprehensive everyday finance application serving more than 500,000 registered users nationwide. What began primarily as a fast and reliable way to convert bitcoin to naira has matured into a platform intentionally built to solve real, daily financial needs beyond trading activity.
    


        This growth has been powered by consistency rather than hype. Many Nigerians first downloaded the app to sell bitcoin in Nigeria or complete USDT to naira transactions quickly during urgent market movements. What sustained user retention, however, was dependable payout speed, transparent exchange rates, and a clean interface that removed unnecessary complexity from crypto transactions. As users repeatedly experienced reliable settlements, word-of-mouth referrals accelerated. That organic trust became one of the strongest forces behind Monica Cash's steady expansion.
    


        According to the Founder, the long-term ambition extended beyond simple crypto conversion. “We understood that Nigerians needed more than just a place to convert bitcoin to naira. They needed a dependable financial platform they could use every day. Becoming the best crypto app in Nigeria means delivering speed, transparency, and security consistently, not only during market highs but during everyday transactions.”
    


        Today, Monica Cash operates as more than a crypto gateway. Users can top up airtime, purchase data, pay electricity and cable bills, access digital gift cards, and transfer funds instantly to over 30 Nigerian banks. This strategic diversification strengthens its identity as an integrated financial ecosystem rather than just a trading utility.
    


        For users who closely monitor the bitcoin to naira rate today or require immediate USDT to naira settlements, execution speed remains decisive. In volatile markets, even short delays can translate into missed value. Monica Cash processes withdrawals rapidly, often within minutes, reducing uncertainty and reinforcing confidence. With over $350 million processed
    


        in crypto conversions alone, the platform demonstrates both operational depth and strong liquidity management.
    


        Beyond speed and scale, compliance discipline has quietly shaped Monica Cash's internal structure. In an environment where informal operators sometimes weaken public trust, structured transaction monitoring, transparent rate calculations, and consistent reporting standards provide measurable reassurance. This operational maturity strengthens confidence for anyone looking to sell bitcoin in Nigeria or convert bitcoin to naira within a regulated and secure framework.
    


        Security architecture remains central to the platform's long-term credibility. Biometric login functionality, encrypted transaction processing, and high system uptime directly address one of the most important concerns Nigerians face when choosing the best crypto app in Nigeria. In a competitive digital finance market filled with short-term entrants, sustained performance and reliability continue to differentiate Monica Cash as a stable financial partner.
    


        Importantly, the ₦500 billion milestone signals more than transaction volume. It reflects behavioral trust at scale. When over half a million Nigerians repeatedly choose the same platform to sell bitcoin in Nigeria, complete USDT to naira transactions, and check the bitcoin to naira rate today, it suggests confidence built through repeated positive experience. That kind of cumulative validation cannot be manufactured through marketing alone; it is earned through operational consistency.
    


        Crossing ₦500 billion represents three years of disciplined execution, technological refinement, and user-centered design. For individuals looking to convert bitcoin to naira instantly, complete seamless USDT to naira transactions, or operate within a secure ecosystem that simplifies everyday payments, Monica Cash continues to raise the benchmark. Download Monica Cash today and discover why more users consistently choose it as the best crypto app in Nigeria for crypto conversion and everyday financial management in one trusted platform.

Big questions are swirling around AI's real impact — and consultants are racing to supply the answers.

Over the past year, consulting firms have begun deploying armies of AI agents as they work to transform their own operations and advise clients to do the same — automating research, building task-specific tools, and building proprietary AI models.

McKinsey & Company CEO Bob Sternfels said last month that his firm has launched tens of thousands of internal AI agents in recent years, and eventually plans to have one for all of the company's 40,000 employees.

Amid the rapid rollout, consultants are now asking themselves a tough question: Is it worth it? They are working to measure if AI is truly improving performance, boosting revenue, and freeing consultants to focus on higher-value work.

"I think we are now in the age of confusion," Mina Alaghband, a former McKinsey partner, now the chief customer officer at Writer, a full-stack enterprise AI platform built for agentic AI, told Business Insider.

Alaghband said that a year ago, most companies were focused on adoption, tracking metrics such as how often a tool was used.

Now, she says said the emphasis should be on measuring the value that's created — like the amount of human labor reassigned to higher-value work, or improvements in revenue.

PwC's chief AI officer, Dan Priest, recently told Business Insider that PwC is now less concerned with how many agents it deploys, and more with how many human users each agent has.

Priest said his firm starts by targeting an "impact zone," such as improving the customer experience.

Within these impact zones, the firm looks to deploy "specialized AI agents" that have earned that designation because they're good at what they do, Priest said. "When we deploy agents, we want to see a high rate of human adoption, which means more humans are using them," he said.

EY also prioritizes quality over quantity, Steve Newman, EY's global engineering chief, told Business Insider. The firm tracks the value created by its AI agents through key performance indicators for productivity, quality, and cost efficiency on a month-to-month basis.

If the defining promises of the AI boom are speed and efficiency, then the metric that may matter more isn't usage, but time reclaimed.

Boston Consulting Group tracks its agents by that metric — and whether that time is then reinvested in higher-value work, Scott Wilder, a partner and managing director based in Dallas, told Business Insider.

Wilder said humans at the firm now spend about 15% less time on low-value activities, like making slideshows, and that those people are reinvesting about 70% of their saved time into higher-value activities, such as deeper analysis.

Time saved doesn't always mean more work. At BCG, it can mean more free time. Wilder said BCG has found that employees keep about 30% of the time AI saves. "They get a little more sleep or get to go to a yoga class or whatever someone wants to do," he said.

Nearly a century ago, economist John Keynes predicted that as productivity rose, the balance between work and leisure would inevitably change.

"I would predict that the standard of life in progressive countries one hundred years hence will be between four and eight times as high as it is," he wrote in his 1930 essay "Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren."

It's almost 2030, but in small ways, that vision may already be surfacing.

"It's benefiting them — and this is a tough job, so every hour of free time matters," Wilder said.

The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a civil rights icon, Baptist minister and two-time Democratic presidential candidate, died Tuesday at age 84.

The Jackson family confirmed his passing in a statement on Tuesday morning.

"Our father was a servant leader — not only to our family, but to the oppressed, the voiceless, and the overlooked around the world," his family said.

"We shared him with the world, and in return, the world became part of our extended family. His unwavering belief in justice, equality, and love uplifted millions, and we ask you to honor his memory by continuing the fight for the values he lived by."

 He died peacefully surrounded by his family on Tuesday morning, the family said in their statement. Jackson is survived by his wife, Jacqueline, six children and multiple grandchildren.

The civil rights leader spent decades in the public eye fighting to end racial and class divisions in America.

A protege of Martin Luther King Jr., Jackson fought on the front lines of the battle against Jim Crow segregation laws as a college student. He stood out for his rousing speeches, radical ideas and passion for racial equality. Jackson would become a key figure in the civil rights movement that pressed for broader economic opportunities for Black people through the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, or SCLC, and more recently, his organization the Rainbow PUSH coalition. 

Jackson eventually transitioned into politics. In 1984 and 1988, he ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, winning multiple primaries and surpassing expectations each time. He based his campaigns on expanded equality for various racial minority groups, the working class and women.

Later, Jackson served as U.S. special envoy to Africa in the 1990s. He also acted as "shadow senator" for Washington, D.C., a role in which he lobbied for the district's statehood.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Jackson also negotiated the release of dozens of international hostages and prisoners, and became a vocal supporter of voting and LGBTQ rights. 

He was no stranger to controversy. During the 1984 presidential primary, he referred to Jews with the slur "Hymies" and called New York "Hymietown" in remarks he at first denied and later apologized for. "Saturday Night Live" lampooned the incident in a sketch featuring Eddie Murphy playing Jackson. And, in a testament to his stature in American political and popular culture, Jackson himself hosted "SNL" later that year.

In 2001, he admitted to having an extramarital affair that led to the birth of a daughter.

Jackson had been fighting Parkinson's disease since November 2017. In August 2021, he and his wife were hospitalized with Covid-19 at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. He was discharged in September after receiving successful treatment for the virus and Parkinson's disease. 

While Jackson had largely been absent from the political and civil rights main stage in recent years, he had taken every opportunity to renew pushes for equality. 

"If we played the big game, and the rules are not fair, and goals not clear and public, we would protest, but in politics we seem to make it alright, it's not alright," said Jackson in a 2018 podcast appearance. "We want a system that's fair, and fairly applied. Americans want and deserve an even playing field with equal protection under the law, equal access and fairness."

His family said Tuesday that it was his "unwavering commitment to justice, equality and human rights" that helped shape "a global movement for freedom and dignity."

"A tireless change agent, he elevated the voices of the voiceless—from his Presidential campaigns in the 1980s to mobilizing millions to register to vote—leaving an indelible mark on history," the statement said.

Jesse Louis Jackson was born Oct. 8, 1941, in Greenville, South Carolina, to Helen Burns and Noah Louis Robinson, a married man and former professional boxer. 

A year after Jackson was born, his mother married Charles Henry Jackson, a post office worker who later adopted him when he was 15.

Jackson grew up being taunted by other school children for his out-of-wedlock birth, which he said ultimately became his motivation to succeed. 

''It is where I get the drive to think I could change the South through the civil rights movement and run for President,'' Jackson told The New York Times in 1997. 

As a child, Jackson would know the harsh reality of the Jim Crow era, growing up at a time when racial segregation was in full force across the U.S. He attended all-Black public schools and was taught to sit at the back of buses and use "colored" restrooms and drinking fountains. 

After graduating from Greenville's Sterling High School in 1959, Jackson spent a year at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He then transferred to North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College, or A&T, a historically Black school in Greensboro, North Carolina. 

It was during his time at A&T that he first became active in the civil rights movement. Jackson joined the local Congress of Racial Equality chapter in Greensboro and participated in local protests and sit-ins against segregated public facilities. 

"I came out of Greensboro," Jackson told the Greensboro News & Record in 2015. "It was my launching pad. All that I subsequently became in the movement came out of the lessons I learned in Greensboro."

After being barred from accessing books at the public library and placed in jail for trying to use the same library for class work, Jackson said he felt the "insult of segregation" and the "liberating power of going to jail for dignity," according to the News & Record. 

While home from college, he became a part of the Greenville Eight, a group of Black students who in 1960 protested the South Carolina city's segregated library system. Jackson and seven Black high school students refused to leave the whites-only Hughes Main Library and were arrested for "disorderly conduct."

Following their staged sit-in, the library system of the city became racially integrated.

It marked the beginning of what would become a lifetime career of civil rights activism. 

After graduating from A&T in 1964, Jackson pursued divinity studies at the Chicago Theological Seminary and began to organize student support for Martin Luther King Jr. 

On March 7, 1965, a day that would become known as Bloody Sunday, Jackson watched on television as club-wielding Alabama state troopers fired tear gas and charged at hundreds of nonviolent demonstrators who had just crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. The demonstrators were part of the historic marches from Selma to the Alabama capital of Montgomery to fight for Black civil and voting rights. 

A day after witnessing the violence on television, Jackson organized a caravan of seminary students to drive down to Alabama and join King in the Selma-to-Montgomery marches.

Jackson appeared at several commemorations of the marches, including an event hosted by former President Bill Clinton on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in 2000.  

"The blood of Selma set all of us free," Jackson said at the event, surrounded by several prominent civil rights leaders and then-President Clinton. "How can I forget that season? My first-born son Jesse Jr. was born when we were marching here, I almost named him Selma." 

"In Selma, America was reborn, democracy redefined, human rights redefined. The fruits of Selma are bountiful. And so today, we say to all of America, America won. One flag, one nation," Jackson said, drawing roaring applause. "Not the flag of sedition and slavery and segregation. But one America, one flag."

Impressed by Jackson's passion and organizational abilities during the marches, King gave him a staff position at the SCLC, the civil rights organization that King led until his death. Just three courses short of finishing his studies at the seminary, Jackson dropped out to pursue a full-time career in civil rights. Though he still became an ordained Baptist minister in 1968. 

In 1966, he was placed in charge of the Chicago branch of Operation Breadbasket, an SCLC initiative that monitored white companies' treatment of Black people and organized boycotts calling for fair hiring practices. 

While Jackson was seen by some in the SCLC as a "loose cannon" who worked too independently of others in the organization, his leadership was integral to the Chicago branch's success. Under Jackson, the Operation Breadbasket branch won 2,000 new jobs worth $15 million a year in new income to the Black community. 

He was promoted to national director of Operation Breadbasket in 1968, the same year King was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee. Jackson was a floor below King when he was shot dead at the Lorraine Motel on April 4, though he told reporters that the civil rights leader died in his arms, a claim that several King aides have disputed. 

"Every time I go back, it pulls a scab off and the wound is still raw. Every time, the trauma of the incident. His lying there. Blood everywhere. It hurts all the time," Jackson said in a 2018 interview with CNN. 

Jackson was embroiled in controversy after the assassination, with other SCLC leaders accusing him of using the organization and King's death for self-promotion. 

Ralph Abernathy, King's successor as chairman of the SCLC, told The New York Times in 1977, "I hope God has forgiven [Jackson.]"

In 1971, Jackson formally resigned from the SCLC and founded Operation PUSH, or People United to Serve Humanity — his own Chicago-based civil rights organization that aimed to improve the economic conditions of Black communities across the U.S. Twenty-five years later, it would merge with the National Rainbow Coalition, Jackson's other civil rights organization that sought equal rights for the working class, women and racial minority groups. 

Since its establishment, Jackson has served as president of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, which aims to "protect, defend, and gain civil rights by leveling the economic and educational playing fields," according to its website. 

Jackson's fame would escalate in 1984 when he ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, becoming the second Black American to launch a nationwide campaign for president. While pundits dismissed his candidacy, Jackson had a surprisingly strong run. 

He came in third in the competitive race for the Democratic nomination as Walter Mondale became the nominee, and would exceed expectations again when he ran for president a second time. In 1988, Jackson came in second behind nominee Michael Dukakis. 

But his unsuccessful presidential campaigns were not the end of his political career. In 1991, Jackson won election to an unpaid office of "statehood senator," popularly known as "shadow senator," to lobby the U.S. Congress for statehood for the District of Columbia. 

″Why D.C. statehood? Why not mayor?″ Jackson asked at a gathering of Democratic women in July 1990, The Associated Press reported. ″Because my life commitment is to expand democracy. My quest is not employment. It's empowerment.″

He would serve as a "shadow senator" until getting tapped by then-President Clinton to become the U.S. special envoy to Africa in 1997. 

"What joy, what privilege, what responsibility," Jackson said at his swearing-in ceremony. "I called my mother; we prayed."

"It is quite a journey from Haynie Street in Greenville, South Carolina. A happy home, but an environment of such low expectations, where our family was denied the right to vote, even though my father was an honorably discharged veteran of the army," Jackson said. "From that to an assignment by the President and Secretary of State, to in some small measure, to help shape our foreign policy by building bridges between the U.S. and Africa."

On several occasions, Jackson also worked independently to secure the release of prisoners held by anti-American regimes. 

He frustrated President Ronald Reagan's administration by traveling to Syria in 1983 to seek the release of a U.S. fighter pilot who had been held hostage by the Syrian government. That same year, he negotiated the release of 48 American and Cuban prisoners held hostage by the communist Cuban government. And in 1991, Jackson worked to free several hundred citizens hiding in Iraq and Kuwait before the Persian Gulf War. 

Jackson also advocated for the LGBTQ community when few prominent Democrats dared to do so, becoming the first speaker at a Democratic National Convention to mention gay and lesbian Americans.

He has been a long champion of voting rights as well. In August, he and others were arrested outside the U.S. Capitol during a demonstration calling for the end to the filibuster. 

"Black and Brown people are the base of the party. We're not the bottom. We're the foundation," Jackson told the crowd, according to The Washington Post. "If we lose, they lose. If we lose, democracy loses. If we lose, Democrats lose. If we lose, the nation loses."

In this article

U.S. Treasury yields were relatively unchanged on Tuesday as investors looked ahead to more delayed data releases during the holiday-shortened trading week.

The 10-year Treasury yield dropped less than 1 basis point to 4.052%, while the 30-year Treasury bond yield fell more than 1 basis point to 4.682%. The 2-year Treasury note yield was more than 2 basis points higher at 3.437%.

One basis point equals 0.01%, and yields move inversely to prices.

The bond market was closed for Presidents' Day on Monday, and Tuesday is shaping up to be a quiet start to the week for investors, who are awaiting several economic data releases.

Investors are anticipating the FOMC minutes on Wednesday, which they will parse for insights on the last interest rate decision and future monetary policy.

They are also expecting more delayed economic data this week, including housing data for November and December on Wednesday, as well as December's personal consumption expenditures index on Friday, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge.

Traders are currently pricing in a 90% chance of the Fed keeping interest rates unchanged in a range between 350-375, per the CME FedWatch Tool.

Cosmos floated his quadcopter over the ruined warehouse, guiding it through a corner of the roof where shattered metal sheets had collapsed to form a hole.

The drone pilot's unit, the Wild Division, suspected that the building was a logistics hub for Russian soldiers, roughly 15 km, or about 9 miles, from the line of contact in southern Ukraine. These hidden locations often held ordnance or fuel stockpiles, and Cosmos' fiber-optic drone was armed with explosives to destroy them.

Yet inside, the drone rotated its camera to reveal what looked more like a farmer's garage: Four civilian cars, a pair of motorcycles, and two bridled horses.

"We had not expected to see this. It was unusual," Cosmos told Business Insider, speaking on condition that he be identified only by his call sign.

"We were expecting to find some armored vehicles," he added.

Video of the discovery went viral last week in Ukraine, as the war has increasingly seen Russian soldiers using unconventional transport tools, such as pack animals and bicycles, to conduct assaults or logistics missions. Cosmos said his drone mission was conducted in early February.

The smaller profile of a horse or civilian car might be harder for a drone to spot, though Russia's repeated use of them has also raised questions about the viability of its tactics and whether it's been producing enough military equipment to sustain its invasion.

Cosmos' squad mates and officers at the Wild Division, a first-person-view drone company in the 82nd Air Assault Brigade, had seen clips of Russian soldiers riding on horses to attack Ukrainian positions before.

One famous example they remember was in Zaporizhzhia, when a Ukrainian drone crew attacked Russian infantry crossing the front lines on horseback last month.

Cosmos, who's been piloting drones for a year, said it was the first time he'd personally seen the animals on the front lines.

He flew his explosive-laden drone straight into the back of one of the cars, and said his crew later struck several other vehicles inside. When Russian troops moved their transport assets, the Wild Division found the next warehouse and attacked that one, too, Cosmos said.

"The enemy usually lives in hiding close to these places," Cosmos said of the warehouse. "It's common for us to check all targets. Sometimes we can see the enemy infantry, or you can see their vehicles."

The Wild Division declined to say where exactly the warehouse was located, but its brigade is generally deployed in the Donbas.

The commander of Cosmos' battalion told Business Insider that the discovery of the horses surprised him, too.

"I thought it had been a location for transport vehicles, sort of a transfer hub," said the major, whose call sign is Fizruk.

Fizruk said the appearance of horses and cars in his area of the front line could be a sign that Russian forces are running low on standard resources, but also reflects Moscow's attritional nature of fighting.

The cars discovered by Cosmos appear to be Nivas, inexpensive civilian off-road vehicles from the Russian Lada car brand.

"They treat these like they will be losses anyway, that they will be destroyed anyway," he said. "Look, a Niva costs, let's say, $2,000. A Hummer, which the Armed Forces of Ukraine uses in many places, costs $20,000, maybe more."

"Since they lose their equipment in assaults, from that point of view, why pay $20,000 for one vehicle if you can buy 10 Nivas for $20,000?" Fizruk added.

The Kremlin is known to pressure the front line with repeated ground assaults, sending small groups of infantry to approach Ukrainian positions on foot or in cheap vehicles. The strategy has been costly, with NATO now saying that up to 25,000 Russian troops are dying each month.

Sustaining that style of war has pushed Moscow to informal means of recruitment and weapons procurement, including hiring troops from overseas and receiving ammunition from North Korea.

Business Insider Edition 

Italian energy giant Eni has announced a major natural gas and condensate discovery offshore Côte d'Ivoire, marking the second-largest hydrocarbon find in the country's history.


        The discovery, named Calao South, was made after drilling the Murene South‑1X exploration well in Block CI‑501, where Eni holds a 90% stake in partnership with state-owned Petroci Holding.
    


        The company estimates the field contains up to three trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 100 million barrels of condensate, roughly equivalent to 1.4 billion barrels of oil. The find follows Eni's earlier Baleine field development, which remains the country's largest offshore resource.
    


        The well was drilled by the Saipem Santorini drillship to a depth of over 5,000 metres in water around 2,200 metres deep. High-quality reservoir sands were encountered, and Eni plans further testing to determine production potential and timelines for commercial development.
    


        The Calao South find strengthens Ivory Coast's energy base, supporting potential domestic power generation, industrial growth, and regional exports.
    


        “This discovery confirms the significant resource potential offshore Ivory Coast and reinforces the region's appeal to global energy investors,” said an Eni spokesperson.
    


Reuters reports that output from Baleine, Ivory Coast's largest hydrocarbon development, is expected to rise to 150,000 barrels of oil and 200 million cubic feet of gas per day with the launch of Phase 3, noting this would make the field a key asset for the country's domestic energy needs.



        With rising demand for energy across West Africa, this discovery could also help Ivory Coast meet domestic consumption while exporting to neighboring markets.
    


        For Eni, the find reinforces its strategic presence in West Africa, complementing other deepwater projects in Angola, Ghana, and Nigeria.
    


        Italian energy giant Eni has in recent years deepened its oil production collaboration across Africa.
    


        In a previous report, Business Insider Africa noted that Eni, alongside the United Kingdom's BP, confirmed a fresh 500 million-barrel oil discovery offshore Angola, reinforcing the Southern African nation's efforts to bolster crude production amid sustained output pressures and shifting global energy flows.
    


        The Calao South discovery highlights the continuing potential of West Africa's offshore hydrocarbon basins, attracting multinational energy companies eager to tap new gas and condensate reserves to meet both regional and global demand.

Alibaba Group has released its newest AI model series, featuring enhanced capabilities, as it faces intensifying competition in China's AI space with several models launched in the past week. 

The Qwen3.5 AI model comes in an open-weight version, which allows users to download, run, fine-tune, and deploy it on their own infrastructure. Alibaba also released a "hosted version," meaning the model can run on Alibaba's own servers.  

Both models were made available on Monday, the eve of the Chinese New Year, and come just a week after Alibaba released a new AI model designed for robots. 

The company highlighted that Qwen3.5 offers improvements in performance and cost and was built with "native multimodal capabilities," enabling the models to understand text, images and video simultaneously within one system.

Leaning into a major AI trend this year, the model also supports new coding and agentic capabilities and is compatible with open-source AI agents like those from OpenClaw, which recently surged in popularity. 

AI agents are systems that can independently take actions and complete multi-step tasks on a user's behalf with minimal supervision. 

These agents and their abilities have garnered a lot of attention in recent weeks, after American AI company Anthropic released new agent tools. The potential for these agents to replace the work of software as a service companies, amongst others, has rocked markets. 

Alibaba's local competitors such as ByteDance and Zhipu AI also released upgraded models in the past week aimed at supporting more agent capabilities.

Marc Einstein, research director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC that artificial intelligence companies are preparing for the possibility that AI agents could "upend traditional Internet business models."

"If this happens the consequences for those who are not prepared will be severe and [Chinese AI companies] are aware of this," he said. 

Alibaba said that its new Qwen3.5 open-weight model comes with 397 billion parameters — variables that shape how an AI system learns and reasons. While less than its previous flagship model, the company said the latest model showed significant improvement based on self-reported benchmark evaluations.

Alibaba provided benchmark tests showing that Qwen3.5's performance was on par with leading models from OpenAI, Anthropic and Google DeepMind, though the comparisons were self-reported. 

Meanwhile, it also released a "hosted model" called the Qwen-3.5-Plus through its cloud platform Model Studio. Alibaba said this version also demonstrated performance on par with leading competitors. CNBC could not independently verify those claims.

The new Qwen3.5 models also support 201 languages and dialects, up from the previous generation's 82. Counterpoint's Einstein said this feature reflects Alibaba's global ambitions.

The company is expected to release more open-weight models during this Chinese New Year, Lin Junyang, technical lead of Alibaba Cloud's Qwen team said in a social media post.

Following the release of Anthropic's latest Claude AI agent tools, other American AI giants have been accelerating the development of agentic capabilities. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Sunday that the creator of the OpenClaw would be joining the company. 

Last month, Google DeepMind head Demis Hassabis told CNBC that Chinese AI models were just "months" behind Western rivals.

Salesforce cofounder Parker Harris addressed the controversy over CEO Marc Benioff's ICE jokes in an internal meeting, saying he was "not OK with it," Business Insider has learned.

"Marc made a very bad joke," Harris, who is the company's chief technical officer, said. "But that's something that Marc did, and I'm not gonna call him out in public out on the internet."

A transcript of Harris' remarks at a meeting of the product and tech team last week was posted by an employee to a Slack channel. Business Insider verified that the transcript was accurate.

Salesforce did not respond to a request for comment. Benioff has not spoken about the jokes or the company's reaction to them.

In his meeting, Harris began by addressing a question about why many company leaders had not addressed Benioff's comments at Salesforce's employee-only company kickoff in Las Vegas last Tuesday.

"So I'll start by saying that somebody already has, and it was immediately leaked," Harris said, referring to a Business Insider story about another executive who criticized Benioff's jokes.

"Let's talk about it with each other and not out to Business Insider and other places because it doesn't do us any good," he said, adding, "It's a violation of the Code of Conduct, and it's a fireable offense. And if we do catch you, we will fire you."

At the kickoff, Benioff made "multiple" jokes about ICE, including one about agents surveilling Salesforce employee travel, employees told Business Insider at the time.

Workers reacted with anger on Slack, which is owned by Salesforce. Slack General Manager Rob Seaman posted a comment saying he could not "defend or explain" his boss' comments.

"They do not align with my personal values and I know this to be the case for many of you as well," he wrote.

Craig Broscow, a Salesforce VP, acknowledged the "deep disappointment" in his own Slack message after the kickoff remarks.

"It would be a step in the right direction and for Marc to acknowledge as soon as possible — ideally publicly — that his attempted joke was extremely upsetting to large segments of his employee base," Broscow said.

Speaking to his team, Harris said Seaman got in hot water for his post.

"I'll tell you personally, and this is what Rob said as well, and I respect Rob for saying that, but he got in big trouble 'cause it went out on the internet," Harris said. "Personally, I'm not OK with that joke."

Harris went on to say that "it's hard right now with what is going on [in] the US" and "what's going in, like, Minneapolis is not about our software. Our software is not being used there."

Harris said Salesforce is "not a political organization" and encouraged employees to make their views known at the ballot box.

"I'm going to use my democratic right to vote, and that's how I'm gonna take action against some of the things that I'm not okay with," he said.

He closed with saying, "So that's my statement. It may not make you feel better. So I'm sorry if it doesn't make you feel better. I think we should keep talking about it. I'm totally fine talking about it more. Please keep it confidential."

Lufthansa can finally start making money on its Boeing 787 Dreamliners after a certification debacle left one of its most lucrative cabins largely empty for months.

The German flag carrier said on Monday that it will begin selling tickets for its Allegris business class on the 787. Allegris, Lufthansa's signature cabin concept, spans economy, premium economy, business, and first class, but the business class rollout has been particularly tricky.

The program first launched on the Airbus A350 in May 2024, with the cabin spanning the entire plane. The first Allegris-equipped 787 followed in October 2025, but certification of business class dragged on due to the cabin's complexity: there are five staggered seat configurations in a single airplane cabin — some with doors or more legroom, others with extra-long beds.

This is because the Dreamliner's geometry — including a slightly tighter usable footprint and different fuselage contouring compared to the A350 — made it harder to demonstrate to regulators that passengers could evacuate quickly from every seat, whether staggered, partially enclosed, or fully cocooned, in an emergency.

The result? For months, only four of the 28 business class seats could be sold — the front-row Business Class Suites — leaving the remaining 24 empty. Business class is a cash cow for airlines, and by flying most of the cabin empty as competitors pour investments into their own premium seats, Lufthansa was essentially leaving money on the table.

It has been a particularly costly headache for a carrier in the midst of a multi-year turnaround plan to restore profitability after years of financial pressure from frequent maintenance, aircraft shortages, rising operating costs, and labor strikes.

Lufthansa even opted for an already-certified business-class seat to retrofit onto its Airbus A380s rather than risk another prolonged and costly certification process.

But the saga is nearing the finish line. Beginning April 15, Lufthansa plans to carry passengers in 25 business-class seats on its 787s, with three remaining blocked in the second row of the cabin.

Bookings are open, though it's unclear whether the news indicates the seats have been fully certified or if that's just Lufthansa's expected timeline.

Lufthansa said "Classic" seats — one of the Allegris categories available — are free to secure with the premium fare.

The others require an extra fee: this includes the first-row suites, the "Privacy" seat next to the window, the "Extra Space" seat with more legroom, and the "Extra Long Bed" with an over seven-foot sleeping surface.

The three second-row seats that are blocked — and not yet available for booking — are two privacy seats and an extra-legroom seat.

Lufthansa flies eight Allegris-equipped Dreamliners and expects to have 29 by the end of 2027.

They are set to first fly from Frankfurt to Rio de Janeiro, Bogota, Cape Town, Shanghai, Hyderabad, Hong Kong, and Austin; New York-JFK and Los Angeles join the roster in June, followed by Delhi in July.

As part of Lufthansa's greater multibillion-dollar fleet overhaul plan, Allegris is also being fit onto the airline's existing A350s and Boeing 747-8s, as well as its future, yet-to-be-certified Boeing 777Xs.

A similar spacing issue on the 747 double-deckers' upper level means it will have a split business class: the lower deck will have Allegris, while upstairs will feature the plane's original cabin.

As crypto adoption continues to strengthen, stablecoins are moving to the forefront, with their use cases expanding across everyday financial activity. According to a new global survey by financial infrastructure provider BVNK, a growing share of workers receive salaries, pay bills, and make routine purchases using digital dollars.

The BVNK findings reflect broader trends in which crypto forms of fiat currencies, including stablecoins like USDT and USDC, which are pegged to the US dollar, are increasingly integrated into commercial and consumer products.

According to the BVNK survey, a good number of respondents reported using stablecoins for routine economic life. These use cases include receiving stablecoin-denominated paychecks as salaries, paying bills and monthly expenses with stable assets, and purchasing goods and services at merchants accepting digital currencies. 

The report suggests that stablecoins' appeal is due to a combination of low transaction costs, 24/7 settlement, and resistance to local currency depreciation. In countries with volatile exchange rates and weak currencies, workers and businesses increasingly see stablecoins as a way to preserve value and reduce friction in cross-border transactions.

In addition to payroll use cases, stablecoin adoption is growing for digital commerce and peer-to-peer transactions. Users from the survey cited ease of use on mobile wallets, near-instant settlement, and compatibility with global payment networks as key advantages over traditional bank transfers or remittance services.

While the prevalence of stablecoin usage varies globally, businesses operating in frontier and emerging markets have been early adopters of crypto-denominated payroll and payment systems. Some tech firms, freelancers, and remote workers now negotiate contracts and compensation in digital dollars, viewing them as a more flexible medium of exchange across borders.

Beyond individual usage, BVNK's data indicates that stablecoin payment volume tied to actual purchasing and spending is increasing faster than only trading activity on exchanges. This distinction underscores how stablecoins are beginning to play a role not just as trading instruments, but as money used in daily life.

Cross-border remittances, for example, have long been touted as a core use case for digital dollars, particularly in corridors with high migrant worker flows. Stablecoins allow senders to avoid high fees and slow settlement times characteristic of traditional remittance providers, especially when moving funds between emerging markets and developed economies.

Similarly, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) servicing international clients are increasingly offering stablecoin payment options to streamline billing and reduce foreign exchange risk. 

However, the BVNK report highlights that while stablecoins are gaining ground as digital money, confidence in the space hinges on transparency of reserves and issuer practices. Education and user experience are additional variables that could affect the pace of adoption. Many potential users still lack a basic understanding of wallet security, how blockchain works, and on-chain risk management. These could slow stablecoins' transition into broader commercial usage without supportive infrastructure and onboarding tools.

Gemini Space Station Inc. (GEMI) is parting ways with three top executives, including its chief operating officer (COO), chief financial officer (CFO) and chief legal officer (CLO), the exchange disclosed in a filing on Tuesday.

COO Marshall Beard, CFO Dan Chen and CLO Tyler Meade are all leaving effective immediately, according to the filing. Beard has also resigned from Gemini's board of directors. The company said his resignation was not the result of any disagreement related to its operations, policies or practices.

The stock fell more than 10% in early Tuesday trading, underperforming most of its peers. 

The departures come just days after Gemini announced it would shut down its crypto exchange operations in the U.K., European Union (EU) and Australia.

The exchange said it plans to cut roughly 25% of its global workforce and refocus its strategy on the U.S. market and prediction markets, marking a sweeping retrenchment only months after the company went public.

Gemini said it does not plan to appoint a successor COO at this time. Instead, co-founder Cameron Winklevoss will assume many of Beard's responsibilities, including revenue-generating duties, in addition to his existing role.

The board appointed Danijela Stojanovic, Gemini's chief accounting officer since May 2025, as interim CFO, and named Kate Freedman, currently associate general counsel and corporate secretary, as interim general counsel, effective Tuesday.

At least one other higher-level staff member attached to Gemini's APAC division was let go on Tuesday as well, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Gemini did not immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment.

The number of IRS staff assigned to oversee anti-money laundering practices at the firms  dropped to its lowest level in nearly decade.

As cryptocurrency use in the United States surges, the number of federal investigators assigned to review safeguards against dirty money in the industry plummeted last year to the lowest level since at least 2017, according to federal data obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. 

The cuts weaken the anti-money laundering watchdog's office within the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which is tasked with overseeing protections against dirty money in crypto exchanges and other firms registered as so-called money service businesses. Even before the recent reductions, the IRS struggled to oversee dirty money in the fast-growing crypto sector, according to experts. The cuts come amid the Trump administration's broader easing of oversight of crypto exchanges that now move trillions of dollars in value annually. 

“The reduction in supervisory staff at the IRS matches a trend we've seen across [anti-money laundering] enforcement agencies,” said Erica Hanichak, deputy director at the FACT Coalition, a Washington-based nonprofit group that advocates for strong safeguards against illicit financial flows. “This sends the signal that the US is open to dirty money. It undermines our national security and market integrity.”

The IRS did not respond to requests for comment. 

Even as the industry has sought mainstream acceptance, cryptocurrency has played a key role in recent money laundering scandals.

Last November, ICIJ collaborated with 37 media partners in 35 countries to publish The Coin Laundry, an investigation into dirty money in the cryptocurrency industry. The investigation revealed that as recently as July 2025, Huione Group, a Cambodian financial institution flagged by US authorities in May as a “primary money laundering concern,” sent large sums of cryptocurrency to accounts at some of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance and OKX. These fund flows continued even after US authorities found major problems relating to the firms' anti-money laundering protocols.  

Cryptocurrency exchanges allow users to set up accounts to buy, trade and deposit cryptocurrency. They also offer a fast offramp for converting crypto assets into standard currency, a key goal of many crypto-reliant money launderers.

U.S. regulators classify crypto exchanges in the same category as so-called money services businesses (MSBs) like Western Union. Even before last year's cuts, the IRS office tasked with overseeing these businesses struggled to adequately supervise cryptocurrency operations, according to the agency's inspector general. 

In 2021, then-IRS commissioner Charles Rettig told Congress in a letter that the agency needed more staff to address the “rapidly evolving and expanding” cryptocurrency industry. That year, the IRS had 193 agents tasked with examining the anti-money laundering protocols of crypto exchanges and other MSBs, significantly more than in 2025, according to federal data.

“Conducting MSB examinations is an inherently laborious activity,” Rettig said in the letter. “[Examiners] need reinforcements to conduct more examinations of both traditional and digital asset MSBs, especially money transmitter principals. Increased funding for personnel and expenses, such as travel and analytical tools, is also necessary to supervise MSBs.” 

The following year, in 2022, Congress awarded the IRS tens of billions of dollars in additional funding, and the agency began rapidly expanding its ranks and embarked on a push to modernize its systems. But, early last year, the Trump administration's cost-cutting stopped this effort in its tracks, rapidly firing many of the new hires as Republicans in Congress also clawed back much of the new funds awarded to the agency. 

In April, the new administration also disbanded a Justice Department unit that investigated crypto-related crimes. In doing so, the department said it would still “pursue the illicit financing of these enterprises by the individuals and enterprises themselves, including when it involves digital assets, but will not pursue actions against the platforms that these enterprises utilize to conduct their illegal activities.” The Trump administration also quickly dropped enforcement actions against more than a dozen cryptocurrency firms, and the president pardoned several crypto executives who had pleaded guilty to violating anti-money laundering laws.

Cryptocurrency oversight is a very loosely knitted-together safety net.

— Alison Jimenez, an anti-money laundering expert

In 2025, the number of IRS investigators assigned to oversee the dirty money defenses of crypto firms and other money transmitters fell 33 percent to 139 agents, down from 208 in 2024. The falling numbers do not necessarily equate to layoffs, but rather the number of agents assigned to examine anti-money laundering practices in so-called nonbank financial institutions, which include cryptocurrency exchanges and other MSBs. The 2025 number is the lowest in the dataset, which dates back to 2017. ICIJ obtained the data through a public records request. Some U.S. states also supervise anti-money laundering practices at MSBs.  

Christina Rea, a compliance specialist who advises crypto firms on IRS anti-money laundering examinations, says the agency appears to be struggling to keep pace with overseeing dirty money safeguards in cryptocurrency. Rea says a small and dwindling group of IRS agents who possess deep virtual currency experience are tasked with overseeing a booming and highly complex new financial sector.

“What's notable is that this contraction appears to be happening while the regulated crypto and fintech ecosystem has grown dramatically in scale, transaction volume, product complexity and risk exposure,” Rea told ICIJ. “Compared to 2017 and 2018, today's firms are larger, more interconnected with traditional financial institutions, and operating far more sophisticated platforms, and yet examiner resources appear to have decreased rather than expanded.”

Alison Jimenez, an anti-money laundering expert, told ICIJ that, compared with the federal overseers of big banks, the IRS's lighter oversight of nonbank financial institutions results in action being taken rarely, even when agents unearth significant problems. 

“These are juggernaut financial institutions,” Jimenez said. “They are larger than a lot of banks but they are not getting the frequency of examinations or the in-depth examinations that banks get. If there are violations found, there is often no formal action taken.”

Jimenez said that fewer examiners overseeing crypto exchanges and other money transmitters could mean more problems with anti-money laundering safeguards will go undetected for longer and could eventually balloon into larger scandals that hurt consumers and damage the broader industry.

“Cryptocurrency oversight is a very loosely knitted-together safety net,” Jimenez said. “Now it's just getting pulled farther apart.”

Mert Mumtaz is the co-founder and CEO of Helius, a Solana developer infrastructure platform providing RPCs, webhooks, and APIs. He previously worked as a software engineer at Coinbase, where he researched blockchains and built NFT bots for Solana in his spare time. He co-founded Helius in June 2022 to support developers building scalable applications on Solana.

I really like bitcoin's approach of not doing anything that seems much better to me… that's a much better use case for that as the store of value argument.

 — Mert Mumtaz

The programmable element of money doesn't make it money itself… we can think of it as value but it doesn't have to be money.

 — Mert Mumtaz

It's like saying you know why would you invest in robinhood when you've invested in gold it's like they're just completely different asset types with completely different theses on basically everything.

 — Mert Mumtaz

The thing to understand especially in crypto when it's newer technology is that you want to reduce you you you want to find pmf in a very small niche.

 — Mert Mumtaz

If I take that playground that let's say foundation then I can build structures on top of it that I know will stick because they obeyed the laws of physics and so that is to say all the problems that solana had in 2021 were soluble engineering problems.

 — Mert Mumtaz

Today solana does more transactions per second than most chains in crypto combined and it does that not only is it more scale it does it at a lower median fee.

 — Mert Mumtaz

I think we can become 10 x faster a 100 times cheaper and at least two times more usable for developers to then build applications for.

 — Mert Mumtaz

NFTs can actually do… they're a technology that's not just about you know jpegs.

 — Mert Mumtaz

Like ftx blowup did not help with trust but like so that's another so stable coins and high trust use cases like borrow and lending I think like aave's still the gold standard.

 — Mert Mumtaz

A lot of people make the mistake of trying to shoehorn blockchains into solving all sorts of different problems but fundamentally they're just financial technology.

Like ftx blowup did not help with trust but like so that's another so stable coins and high trust use cases like borrow and lending I think like aave's still the gold standard.

A lot of people make the mistake of trying to shoehorn blockchains into solving all sorts of different problems but fundamentally they're just financial technology.

Bitmine has 3,040,483 staked ETH, representing $6.1 billion at $1,998 per ETH; MAVAN staking solution on track to launch Q1 2026

Bitmine now owns 3.62% of the ETH token supply, over 72% of the way to the 'Alchemy of 5%' in just 7 months

Bitmine recently closed on initial $200 million investment into Beast Industries

Bitmine Crypto + Total Cash Holdings + "Moonshots" total $9.6 billion, including 4.371 million ETH tokens, total cash of $670 million, and other crypto holdings

Bitmine leads crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV per share and by the high trading liquidity of BMNR stock

Bitmine is the 158th most traded stock in the US, trading $0.9 billion per day (5-day avg)

Bitmine remains supported by a premier group of institutional investors including ARK's Cathie Wood, MOZAYYX, Founders Fund, Bill Miller III, Pantera, Kraken, DCG, Galaxy Digital and personal investor Thomas "Tom" Lee to support Bitmine's goal of acquiring 5% of ETH

LAS VEGAS, Feb. 17, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE AMERICAN: BMNR) Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc. ("Bitmine" or the "Company") a Bitcoin and Ethereum Network company with a focus on the accumulation of crypto for long term investment, today announced Bitmine crypto + total cash + "moonshots" holdings totaling $9.6 billion.

As of February 16th, 2026 at 5:00pm ET, the Company's crypto holdings are comprised of 4,371,497 ETH at $1,998 per ETH (NASDAQ: COIN), 193 Bitcoin (BTC), $200 million stake in Beast Industries, $17 million stake in Eightco Holdings (NASDAQ: ORBS) ("moonshots") and total cash of $670 million. Bitmine's ETH holdings are 3.62% of the ETH supply (of 120.7 million ETH).

"After spending the past week at Consensus Hong Kong, one of the largest global gatherings in crypto, we came away with a growing conviction that 2026 will be a defining year for Ethereum. We see strengthening product-market fit emerging on the back of three long-duration secular drivers: (i) Wall Street via tokenization/privacy on Ethereum; (ii) AI and AI-agents using Ethereum for both collecting payments as well as verification and (iii) creators leaning towards 'proof of human' and other standards running on Ethereum L2 (Worldchain, etc). There were many panel discussions and presentations around these 3 topics, and it is evident that Ethereum is well positioned to garner significant share, given its neutrality and 100% uptime and reliability," said Thomas "Tom" Lee, Chairman of Bitmine.

Mr. Lee's latest Chairman's message is his keynote given at Consensus HK, and he speaks about these 3 future growth drivers for ETH usage as well as the drivers for Bitmine growth initiatives. The link to his message is here.

"Investor sentiment and enthusiasm, by contrast, are rock bottom, reminding us of the forlornness and dejection seen at the November 2022 lows and depths of 2018 crypto winter. During 2018 and 2022, there were many high profile failures of large players (FTX, 3 arrows in 2022) while 2025-2026 has not seen such large-scale debacles. Rather, it seems like crypto has remained weak since the 'price shock' and massive deleveraging seen on October 10th. For us at Bitmine, we cannot control the price of Ethereum, and the company is acquiring ETH regardless of price trend, as the long-term outlook for Ethereum remains outstanding. Hence, we continue to buy ETH even as crypto moves through this 'mini-winter,'" said Lee.

"In the past week, we acquired 45,759 ETH," continued Lee. "Bitmine has been steadily buying Ethereum, as we view this pullback as attractive, given the strengthening fundamentals. In our view, the price of ETH is not reflective of the high utility of ETH and its role as the future of finance."

As of February 16, 2026, Bitmine total staked ETH stands at 3,040,483 ($6.1 billion at $1,998 per ETH). "Bitmine has staked more ETH than other entities in the world. At scale (when Bitmine's ETH is fully staked by MAVAN and its staking partners), the ETH staking rewards is $252 million annually (using 2.89% 7-day BMNR yield)," stated Lee.

"Annualized staking revenues are now $176 million. And this 3.0 million ETH is about 69% of the 4.37 million ETH held by Bitmine. The CESR (Composite Ethereum Staking Rate, administered by Quatrefoil) is 2.84%, while Bitmine's own staking operations generated a 7-day yield of 2.89% (annualized). We continue to make progress on our staking solution known as The Made in America VAlidator Network (MAVAN). This will be the 'best-in-class' solution offering secure staking infrastructure and will be deployed in early calendar 2026. Bitmine is currently working with 3 staking providers as the Company moves towards unveiling MAVAN in 2026," continued Lee.

Bitmine crypto holding reigns as the #1 Ethereum treasury and #2 global treasury, behind Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR), which owns 714,644 BTC valued at $49 billion. Bitmine remains the largest ETH treasury in the world. 

Bitmine is one of the most widely traded stocks in the US. According to data from Fundstrat, the stock has traded average daily dollar volume of $0.9 billion (5-day average, as of February 13, 2026), ranking #158 in the US, behind KKR (rank #157) and ahead of CBRE (rank #159) among 5,704 US-listed stocks (statista.com and Fundstrat research).

The GENIUS Act and Securities and Exchange Commission's ("the SEC") Project Crypto are as transformational to financial services in 2025 as US action on August 15, 1971 ending Bretton Woods and the USD on the gold standard 54 years ago. This 1971 event was the catalyst for the modernization of Wall Street, creating the iconic Wall Street titans and financial and payment rails of today. These proved to be better investments than gold.

Around the time Rob Hadick signed the paperwork to join Dragonfly Capital in April 2022, he rented a house in the Hamptons. A contract with his former employer, hedge fund GoldenTree, obliged him to refrain from working for six months, so Hadick prepared to lean into forced leisure time in the country. His plans for a relaxed stay soon came undone.

Shortly after his arrival, the crypto market went into free fall following the implosion of a notorious stablecoin project called Terra Luna. Hadick remembers scrolling through Twitter as the contagion spread. His wife called to ask if he was relaxing. “I don't think you understand what's happening to our net worth,” he responded. “I am drinking whiskey in a dark room at 2 p.m. on a Tuesday.” 

His exile finally ended in November—just in time for a second crypto calamity in the form of FTX's collapse. But Hadick never rethought his decision to go all in on crypto. “I was scared about what was happening to the industry,” he recently told Fortune from Dragonfly's offices near New York City's Union Square. “But I was excited about the opportunity we had, because we [still] had $500 million to deploy.” 

That fund, Dragonfly's third, ended up catapulting the firm into the upper echelon of the crypto venture world, competing with the likes of Andreessen Horowitz and Paradigm thanks to its prescient bets on now massive startups including Polymarket, Rain, and Ethena. Now, as crypto enters yet another winter, with token prices plummeting and excitement washed out by AI hype, Dragonfly is announcing its fourth fund, a $650 million vehicle. 

The crypto venture ecosystem is going through a “mass extinction event,” as Hadick put it, but Dragonfly has thrived despite a founder breakup, a regulatory scare from the Department of Justice, and a pivot away from China amid a crypto crackdown. At the core of Dragonfly's strategy are its four symbiotic leaders: Hadick, the fintech bridge; Haseeb Qureshi, the ambassador; Tom Schmidt, the DeFi whiz; and Bo Feng, the firm's mysterious founder and an icon of the Chinese tech scene. “It's bizarre to see us now become one of the incumbents,” said Qureshi. “We're playing a bigger game than we were playing in the past.” 

Qureshi started playing poker professionally at 16 years old, mostly sticking to online games because he wasn't allowed in casinos. By the time he was 21, Qureshi had raked in almost $2 million, but he realized that he didn't want to make the game his life. He made a bet with a friend that if he ever played another hand of professional poker, Qureshi would have to pay him $100,000. “That was my way of sealing off the decision for myself,” he told Fortune.

Qureshi says that his early years at the digital card table prepared him for a pivot into crypto investing. Just as friends told him he was crazy for becoming a teenage poker shark, his decision to join the crypto industry elicited widespread doubt, not least because Qureshi had made a name for himself as a Silicon Valley software engineer. He left a lucrative job at Airbnb to go start a stablecoin startup in 2017, long before stablecoins were all the rage, eventually finding his way to a (then) $500 million venture fund called MetaStable. 

Today, Qureshi is arguably the public face of Dragonfly, thanks to his role on the popular Chopping Block podcast—the crypto version of All-In—and viral posts on Crypto Twitter about the failure of Web3 gaming or the efficacy of blockchain launches. But Qureshi didn't start at Dragonfly until a few months after it began, joining in 2019 as the crypto industry was stuck in one of its regular prolonged downturns.  

That early Dragonfly is unrecognizable from its current form. The firm began as a partnership between Alex Pack, a young VC leading crypto deals at Bain Capital Ventures, and Bo Feng, who had made a name as one of the top investors in China's burgeoning internet ecosystem. Feng, who declined to be interviewed for this story, is reported to have connections to China's political elite, forged in part by his marriage to a granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, who came to power after Mao Zedong's death. 

Through his firm Ceyuan Ventures, Feng had invested in the crypto exchange OKEx (later rebranded to OKX), which in 2018 was the largest exchange in the world. He joined forces with Pack to make bets both in the U.S. and Asia. According to an early article in Bitcoin Magazine, Dragonfly's first $100 million fund was backed by some of the largest names in Asian tech, including Sequoia China's Neil Shen. (Beyond Feng's role as a bridge to the region's financial powerhouses, Qureshi described him as a “relationship savant,” though he keeps a low public profile.)

Dragonfly built its reputation with investments into crypto companies like the exchange Bybit and the financial services firm Matrixport, as well as investing into other crypto venture firms as a fund of funds. According to Qureshi, when he came onboard, he presented three conditions: He wanted to stop doing fund investments, he wanted to lead more deals, and he wanted to build out a technical team. “Bo basically said yes to all three,” Qureshi said. “In his words, he threw the car keys to me…and that was the birth of modern Dragonfly.” One of Qureshi's first moves was to bring on Schmidt, then the head of product at a decentralized exchange called 0x, as a junior investor. (Schmidt quickly rose the ranks to general partner.) 

The split between Pack, who went on to start his own venture firm Hack VC, and Dragonfly is the stuff of crypto VC lore, though Qureshi downplays the drama. “It ultimately led to us just having totally different visions for what fund two and beyond was supposed to look like for Dragonfly,” he said. Pack told Fortune that his first fund with Feng was a “tremendous success,” but realized they were “very different culturally.” 

“I spent a few months helping to hire and train my replacements, and then we parted ways,” he said. Schmidt used more colorful language to describe Pack, attributing the schism to personality.

By 2020, when Pack left the firm, Dragonfly had bigger problems. In large part due to Feng, the firm had its back office team in Beijing. But the Chinese government had begun to crack down on crypto, forcing Dragonfly to pick up its Asia operations and move to Singapore. According to Schmidt, who speaks Chinese and had chosen to intern at a Chinese company during college instead of accepting an early offer from Coinbase, Dragonfly still maintains a strong Asia presence, though its investments in the region have gone down over the years. “You look at the user base of a lot of these chains and [decentralized exchanges], and they're obviously very Asia-based,” he told Fortune, “But in terms of new investment opportunities, there haven't been as many as there used to be.” 

Still, the firm's presence in the U.S. crypto scene grew. There were bigger players raising monster funds, including Paradigm and Haun Ventures, which each had vehicles over $1 billion, compared to Dragonfly's comparatively modest second fund of $225 million closed in late 2020. Still, Dragonfly backed winners such as the layer-1 blockchain Avalanche and the financial services firm Amber Group, as well as an investment into the controversial privacy protocol Tornado Cash, which allows users to anonymize crypto transactions. The latter landed Dragonfly in national headlines in 2025 after prosecutors let slip that Schmidt might face criminal charges for the investment as part of a broader money laundering case. (The Department of Justice quickly backtracked, earning the firm a badge of honor among crypto true believers, though Qureshi said the investment was never ideological.) 

Hadick's arrival amid the existential collapse of FTX, however, catapulted Dragonfly to the next echelon—and solidified the firm's identity.  

During the crypto boom of 2021, entrepreneurs put forth lofty schemes to remake the internet with decentralized plumbing. Those included building would-be alternatives to the likes of Twitter and Spotify. For crypto investors, these plans revolved around so-called token mechanisms, with venture firms receiving rights to own proprietary cryptocurrencies in lieu of traditional equity stakes.

That Web3 vision of the future never fully played out. Even before the collapse of FTX, crypto was headed in one direction: Wall Street. Bitcoin had started out as a form of electronic cash, and then Ethereum built the next layer by allowing developers to code decentralized financial applications for lending and trading. But investors like Hadick, who came from the world of traditional finance, believed that crypto would soon swallow all of the functions of banks and brokerage firms. “We knew that that was the one place where we needed somebody who was deeper than we were,” Qureshi said. “Rob was just the person that we all intellectually felt had the horsepower, the coverage and the experience to play that role.”

When Hadick joined, Dragonfly began to make investments into the kinds of companies that now define the crypto landscape. One, Ethena, was building a synthetic dollar that generated yield through a complicated hedge fund-like strategy on the back end. Though Ethena has since become one of the most prominent projects in the crowded field of stablecoins, when founder Guy Young pitched the idea to investors, most of them dismissed the idea as “insane,” as he put it. The skeptics cited the Terra Luna debacle, which nearly took down the entire crypto industry after the algorithmic-backed stablecoin failed to maintain a $1 peg. “It's actually offensive that you're even saying this after what just happened,” Young remembered investors telling him. 

This was still the middle of the bear market of 2023, and Dragonfly jumped at the opportunity. “They were able to look at it from first principles,” Young said. The firm led Ethena's $6 million seed round. Just over a year ago, Ethena raised a $100 million round, with investors including Franklin Templeton and Fidelity's venture arm. Today, its flagship stablecoin has a market capitalization of around $6.3 billion. 

The next year, Dragonfly backed the Series B funding round for Polymarket, which the firm had almost invested in years before. According to Qureshi, Dragonfly was nearly the first investor into Polymarket's seed round back in 2020, when Shayne Coplan was striking out with most of the VCs he was pitching. “We really loved him,” Qureshi said, even though prediction markets hadn't yet proven successful at the time. Polychain ended up offering a better term sheet, which Dragonfly decided not to match. “It was obviously a massive miss on our part, but we had the right idea,” Qureshi said. 

The rest of the crypto industry eventually came onboard with the idea that the most successful digital asset companies wouldn't be blockchain-based mobile games, but relatively boring versions of financial products like credit cards and money market funds. Even Chris Dixon, the a16z partner who championed the Web3 principles of “read write own,” recently wrote a post on X arguing that we are now in the “financial era of blockchains.” 

“This is the biggest meta shift I can feel in my entire time in the industry,” Schmidt said, adding that investors are realizing there will be fewer native tokens for different crypto protocols, and more tokens that represent a real world asset like stocks and private credit funds. “A lot of crypto funds are now saying, ‘Hey, we're fintech funds,'” Hadick said. “Which is what I think we do better than anybody.”  

The increasing integration of blockchain and the finance industry raises uncomfortable questions of whether crypto is betraying its founding ideals, which saw Bitcoin as a rebellion against the big bank and government control of the financial system. 

“I do always try not to lose sight of the bigger picture, which is we made this digital internet money [go] from zero to a trillion dollars in 10 years,” said Schmidt. “The job is obviously not done, and if anything when I look globally, I think that the need for this stuff is more in demand than ever.” 

Nearly four years after Hadick joined, the crypto venture sector is stuck in another identity crisis, with deals falling and funds struggling to convince backers to refill their coffers. But with its fresh war chest, Dragonfly is ready to shape the next blockchain era. “We talk out loud and we say what we think,” said Qureshi. “In a space that is just completely flooded with bullshit and with fakers and self-promoters, I think that has actually been a superpower.”

The crypto market continued to exhibit weakness on Tuesday morning, broadly following a tech selloff across U.S. equities and a correction in the price of precious metals.

Bitcoin trades at $68,000, down 1.25% since midnight UTC, while Nasdaq futures and gold lost 0.55% and 2.4% respectively over the same period.

Altcoins also lost ground as popular memecoins PEPE, DOGE and TRUMP led the drawdown, losing between 3.5% and 4.5%.

The tech selloff has been driven by fears around artificial intelligence and how it might disrupt several industries. Bitcoin has been closely tied to Nasdaq since Feb. 3, with the correlation coefficient indicator rising from negative 0.68 to positive 0.72 over the past two weeks.

Gold, meanwhile, is currently trading at $4,928 after failing to establish a level of support above $5,000. The precious metal hit a record high of $5,600 on Jan. 28 before a historic 21.5% correction over the subsequent four days.

 Take a 30-second survey to help improve The Block. 

Ethereum's tokenized real-world asset market has topped $17 billion in value issued on its mainnet, according to The Block's data, as large players like BlackRock and JPMorgan continue bringing traditional funds onchain.

The figure represents a nearly 315% increase from a year earlier, when the sector was worth $4.1 billion, and reinforces Ethereum's dominance as the leading blockchain for tokenized finance. Ethereum currently accounts for approximately 34% of total onchain RWA value across all networks. Stablecoins on Ethereum mainnet have also climbed above $175 billion in aggregate market capitalization, underscoring the network's role as the primary settlement layer for tokenized dollar-denominated assets.



The growth highlights an accelerating shift by traditional financial institutions toward blockchain-based versions of familiar products. Wall Street incumbents, including BlackRock and JPMorgan, are building blockchain-native payments, savings, and investment instruments on Ethereum.

BlackRock's tokenized Treasury fund, BUIDL, has emerged as the flagship product in the category. Launched in 2024 via Securitize, the fund invests in short-term U.S. government securities and has grown to become the largest tokenized money-market vehicle on public blockchain infrastructure.

Earlier this month, BlackRock expanded BUIDL's utility by enabling direct onchain trading through UniswapX in collaboration with Securitize and Uniswap Labs, marking one of the clearest intersections yet between institutional capital and decentralized finance.

JPMorgan has also entered the arena. In December, the bank launched its first tokenized money-market fund on Ethereum, seeding it with $100 million and targeting qualified investors. The move builds on the firm's broader blockchain strategy and signals that tokenized yield products are gaining traction beyond crypto-native issuers.

Recent market activity suggests the momentum is not confined to Treasuries alone. This week, Wintermute launched institutional trading for tokenized gold, forecasting that the tokenized commodities segment could reach $15 billion in 2026. Commodities already represent more than $5 billion of Ethereum's RWA footprint.



The surge in Ethereum-based RWAs also aligns with broader projections from major financial institutions. Standard Chartered has previously estimated that tokenized real-world assets could reach $2 trillion by 2028, with the vast majority issued on Ethereum. ARK Invest has projected that tokenized assets could climb to roughly $11 trillion by 2030 from current levels.

Logan Paul, Justin Bieber, Neymar, Madonna and others sit on deep NFT losses as the 2021 celebrity hype cycle gives way to a utility-focused market reset.

Multiple celebrities who purchased non-fungible tokens during the 2021 market peak have experienced substantial losses as NFT valuations declined, according to public blockchain data and marketplace estimates.

Logan Paul purchased a 0N1 Force NFT that has since declined sharply in value, according to blockchain records. Justin Bieber acquired Bored Ape #3001, now estimated to be worth significantly less than its purchase price. Soccer player Neymar bought two Bored Ape NFTs whose combined value has fallen substantially from original acquisition costs.

Madonna purchased a Bored Ape NFT now valued at a fraction of its purchase price, while basketball player Stephen Curry bought a Bored Ape currently trading at lower valuations, according to marketplace data. Rapper Eminem acquired a Bored Ape that has similarly declined in value. Television host Jimmy Fallon purchased a Bored Ape now valued below its peak price.

NFT prices surged in 2021 amid celebrity endorsements and increased speculative demand, according to market analysts. Floor prices across major collections reached elevated valuations during the period. As cryptocurrency market liquidity tightened in 2022 and 2023, NFT markets experienced a prolonged contraction, with many collections losing substantial portions of their peak value.

Bored Ape Yacht Club, previously considered a leading NFT collection, saw floor prices fall from peak levels to lower ranges in subsequent market cycles, according to marketplace tracking data.

Celebrity purchases during the 2021 period occurred near market peaks, reflecting late-cycle momentum, according to blockchain transaction records. The price declines follow patterns observed in previous speculative market cycles.

Despite the decline in collectible NFT pricing, activity continues in gaming assets, digital identity, ticketing and brand engagement applications, according to industry reports. The market has shifted from luxury collectible pricing toward utility-driven models, analysts stated.

The 2021 NFT market cycle followed a pattern of cultural adoption, celebrity participation, speculative activity and subsequent price decline, according to market observers. Digital ownership concepts continue to develop in gaming, media and tokenized identity applications, industry participants reported.

The Agora: Kaiko's institutional forum during EthCC. March 31, Cannes. Tickets Live

 Take a 30-second survey to help improve The Block. 

Stablecoins are shifting from a crypto trading tool to an everyday financial instrument, with users allocating a growing share of their savings and income to dollar-pegged tokens, according to a new global study from BVNK conducted in partnership with Coinbase and Artemis.

Findings from The Stablecoin Utility Report 2026, based on a YouGov survey of 4,658 adults across 15 countries, posits that more than $300 billion in stablecoin market capitalization is increasingly used for payments, payroll, and savings alongside trading activity.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged 1:1 to fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar and backed by reserves or other collateral. These dollar-tied tokens have a circulating supply of around $300 billion, led by Tether's (USDT) and Circle's (USDC), according to The Block's data dashboard.



More than half of respondents said they have held stablecoins in the past 12 months, and 56% intend to acquire more over the next year. Among non-owners, 13% plan to start. Momentum also appears on the rise as half of the current holders increased their balances over the past year.

Stablecoins are capturing a more meaningful slice of personal balance sheets, too. On average, holders said they allocate roughly one-third of their total savings to crypto and stablecoins combined. Moreover, people in places with more volatile local currencies or less reliable cross-border payment services are more incentivized to use stablecoins. The mean allocation was higher in low- and middle-income economies than in high-income markets, according to the study.

Ownership rates in the survey were also higher in low- and middle-income economies than in high-income ones, with Africa leading. Indeed, the region recorded the strongest forward intent to acquire more stablecoins. The data echoes a report from Standard Chartered, which estimated that as much as $1 trillion could ultimately migrate out of emerging market bank deposits into U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins.

Spending behavior reinforces the idea that stablecoins are circulating rather than sitting idle. Among holders, 27% said they spend directly on goods and services, while 45% convert to local currency. More than a quarter convert or spend within days, and roughly two-thirds do so within a few months.

Demand for merchant acceptance appears to be outpacing supply. 52%t of holders said they have made a purchase specifically because a business accepted stablecoins. At the same time, desired spending exceeds current spending across every major category surveyed, including everyday purchases and large lifestyle expenses.

For cross-border workers, stablecoins are not marginal. Among freelancers, gig workers, and marketplace sellers who receive payments in stablecoins, the tokens account for about 35% of annual earnings on average. Nearly three-quarters said stablecoins have improved their ability to work with international clients, and three-quarters of marketplace sellers reported higher sales volumes or expanded customer bases.

Cost savings are a key driver. Respondents who receive payments or remittances in crypto, including stablecoins, reported saving an average of 40% in fees compared with traditional payment and remittance services. Lower transaction fees, better security, and the ability to transact internationally ranked as the top motivations for using stablecoins over other methods.

Still, the report highlights friction points that still kneecap the next phase of adoption.

The most common frustrations include irreversible payments and risk of losing funds, too many steps to complete transactions, and confusion around blockchain selection and wallet management.

Users said they want stablecoin payments to mirror mainstream payment systems, with universal acceptance, clear fees, and stronger consumer protections.

If that connective layer materializes, stablecoins may increasingly function less like crypto assets and more like digital cash — programmable, borderless, and, for a growing cohort of users, simply money.

The findings arrive as regulatory clarity expands in several markets, especially in the United States under President Donald Trump's administration.

After signing the GENIUS ACT into law, policymakers are negotiating a final federal framework for the crypto market that includes dollar-backed tokens. Disagreements around stablecoin yields abound, with industry sources saying the "clock is ticking" to get rules over the line before the midterm elections.

The cryptocurrency sector has never lacked innovation. From the early days of Bitcoin to the smart contract revolution sparked by Ethereum, digital assets have consistently reshaped how capital is formed and distributed. One of the most debated developments in recent years is the resurgence of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), accompanied by a noticeable rise in influencer-led outreach.

A growing number of blockchain projects are collaborating with online personalities to introduce their token offerings to broader audiences. This trend raises an important question: Is influencer-led ICO outreach truly driving the latest fundraising boom, or is it simply amplifying an already active market cycle?

This article explores the mechanisms behind influencer involvement, the structural shifts in crypto fundraising, and the potential long-term implications for investors and project teams.

ICOs initially gained global attention between 2016 and 2018. During that period, projects raised billions of dollars by offering newly issued tokens directly to the public. However, regulatory scrutiny, failed projects, and market downturns significantly reduced ICO activity.

In recent years, alternative token launch models such as Initial DEX Offerings (IDOs) and Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) gained traction. Platforms like Binance introduced structured token sales that added a layer of credibility and due diligence.

Now, ICOs are seeing renewed interest, particularly among early-stage blockchain ventures seeking decentralized fundraising without traditional venture capital gatekeeping. What differentiates this new wave from its predecessor is the central role played by digital influencers.

The cryptocurrency ecosystem has cultivated a strong community presence across platforms such as YouTube, X (formerly Twitter), Telegram, and Discord. Influencers in this space range from independent analysts and blockchain developers to high-profile investors and content creators.

Some figures, including personalities like Vitalik Buterin or Elon Musk, have demonstrated how online commentary can significantly impact digital asset valuations. While not directly tied to ICO outreach, their influence illustrates how narrative and visibility can move markets.

In the context of ICOs, influencer participation often includes:

Reviewing project whitepapers

Hosting live discussions with founders

Explaining token utility models

Sharing allocation breakdowns

Discussing potential risks

Rather than acting as traditional advertisers, many influencers position themselves as interpreters of complex blockchain concepts. Their role blends analysis, commentary, and community engagement.

Crypto investors often rely on peer networks rather than institutional research. Influencers cultivate trust by consistently sharing insights, technical breakdowns, and market commentary. When they introduce an ICO to their audience, it carries an implicit layer of social validation.

This trust dynamic can accelerate fundraising momentum. Early participation by a trusted voice can create a ripple effect, encouraging additional contributors to evaluate the opportunity.

ICOs involve technical components such as tokenomics, smart contracts, vesting schedules, and governance mechanisms. Influencers frequently break down these elements into digestible formats video explainers, infographics, and live Q&A sessions.

For retail investors who may not have advanced technical knowledge, this educational framing lowers the barrier to entry.

Blockchain projects are inherently global. Influencers often command international audiences spanning multiple jurisdictions. A single livestream or thread can reach participants across continents, enabling rapid capital formation without geographic limitations.

This global connectivity contributes to the perception of a fundraising boom, as capital pools aggregate from diverse regions simultaneously.

While influencer outreach plays a visible role, it operates within broader market conditions.

Crypto markets tend to move in cyclical patterns influenced by macroeconomic trends, technological innovation, and investor sentiment. When token prices rise across the board, capital becomes more risk-tolerant. During bullish phases, speculative interest in early-stage projects increases naturally.

Influencer activity often intensifies during these cycles, but it may be amplifying momentum rather than initiating it.

The growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols has normalized on-chain participation. Users familiar with staking, liquidity provision, and governance tokens are more comfortable engaging in ICOs.

This ecosystem familiarity reduces friction and makes community-driven fundraising models more viable.

Some jurisdictions have introduced clearer guidelines for token issuance and digital asset classification. Although global regulation remains fragmented, incremental clarity reduces uncertainty for both founders and contributors.

When combined with influencer-driven awareness, this regulatory evolution can accelerate participation.

Influencer-led outreach operates at the intersection of behavioral economics and community dynamics.

Early token sales often emphasize limited allocation windows. Influencers discussing “early-stage opportunities” can heighten urgency among followers. Even without overt sales language, enthusiasm can trigger rapid participation.

Successful ICOs frequently present compelling visions scalable infrastructure, decentralized governance, or real-world utility. Influencers who articulate these narratives effectively can shape how audiences interpret a project's long-term potential.

When influencers analyze tokenomics or question project founders publicly, it can signal scrutiny. Viewers may interpret this transparency as a form of informal vetting, even though it does not replace professional auditing.

The resurgence of influencer-led ICO outreach is not without controversy.

In some cases, influencers receive token allocations or financial incentives for coverage. Without transparent disclosure, audiences may misinterpret commentary as purely independent analysis.

Regulatory bodies in various countries have begun examining how digital asset endorsements align with securities laws and consumer protection standards.

Retail participants may lack access to the same data as insiders or early contributors. Influencer enthusiasm can unintentionally overshadow technical or financial risks.

ICOs remain high-risk ventures. Token prices can fluctuate dramatically after launch. Even well-intentioned influencers cannot eliminate fundamental project risks such as execution failure, liquidity constraints, or governance challenges.

Blockchain analytics platforms show an increase in token launch activity compared to the subdued period following the 2018 downturn. Capital inflows into early-stage Web3 ventures have also risen, particularly in sectors such as:

Layer-2 scaling solutions

Decentralized AI infrastructure

Cross-chain interoperability

Real-world asset tokenization

Social media engagement metrics reveal that ICO-related discussions have expanded in parallel. Spikes in community membership and token wallet creation often coincide with influencer-hosted events.

However, correlation does not necessarily confirm causation. Influencer outreach may amplify visibility, but underlying technological developments and market optimism also contribute significantly.

If influencer-led ICO outreach continues to expand, several long-term outcomes may emerge:

As scrutiny grows, clearer disclosure frameworks may develop. Influencers could adopt standardized reporting practices when discussing token allocations or compensation.

Projects may provide more comprehensive documentation, third-party audits, and governance clarity to maintain credibility within influencer communities.

Some influencers are evolving into research-oriented analysts, publishing detailed reports and hosting technical workshops. This shift could elevate the overall quality of public discourse around token sales.

The evidence suggests that influencer-led outreach acts as a catalyst rather than a sole driver. It accelerates information flow, amplifies community engagement, and lowers educational barriers. However, the core drivers of fundraising booms remain:

Technological innovation

Market liquidity

Investor risk appetite

Regulatory developments

Influencers operate within these broader forces. Their impact is significant, but it is intertwined with structural market dynamics.

The latest wave of ICO fundraising reflects a convergence of maturing blockchain infrastructure, renewed investor interest, and digitally native communication channels. Influencer-led outreach has become a central feature of this landscape, shaping how projects are introduced and evaluated.

Yet sustainable growth will depend on transparency, robust project fundamentals, and informed participation. As the ecosystem evolves, both influencers and investors carry shared responsibility in fostering credibility and resilience.

The fundraising boom may be visible on social feeds and token dashboards, but its durability will ultimately be determined by real-world utility, technological execution, and community governance.

Influencer-led ICO outreach is not the entire story but it is undeniably a powerful chapter in the ongoing evolution of decentralized capital formation.

German central bank president Joachim Nagel said he sees “merit in euro-denominated stablecoins,” and argues that they could serve as a cheaper and more efficient means for cross-border payments by both firms and individuals.

During his speech at the New Year's Reception of the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany in Frankfurt, Nagel, who leads the Deutsche Bundesbank, added that the EU is “working hard on the introduction of the digital euro.”

“This will be the first pan-European retail digital payment solution, based solely on European infrastructures,” he added.

However, he did not elaborate on how euro-denominated stablecoins would be regulated within the European Union's existing legal framework, nor clarify how they would interact with the planned digital euro or broader monetary policy architecture.

In separate comments made last week, Nagel cautioned that if US dollar-denominated stablecoins were to gain significantly larger market share than a euro-pegged alternative, European monetary policy “could be severely impaired,” and the continent's sovereignty could be weakened.

Nagel, who has long maintained a cautious and skeptical stance toward unbacked cryptocurrencies, has instead advocated the use of a state-backed digital euro, which he believes “will play a role in future resilience” for Europe.

According to him, the central bank has already “accomplished important exploratory work on the possible introduction of a wholesale CBDC.” A wholesale CBDC, he said, would allow financial institutions to make “programmable payments” in central bank money.

Elsewhere in the U.S., there has been a lot of momentum around stablecoin, and the market has been expanding at a rapid pace on the back of demand for dollar-equivalent settlement layers, especially after President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law in July 2025.

But policy deadlock around a key market structure bill has stalled progress and divided crypto industry and banking stakeholders over issues such as stablecoin yield and reward mechanisms.

While Bitcoin (BTC) attempted to climb back above $70,000 and Ethereum (ETH) slipped below $2,000 again, cryptocurrency news was buzzing about WWE wrestler Logan Paul's sale of a Pokémon collectible card for a record $16.5 million, which was once listed as a non-fungible token (NFT). 

One-half of the sibling celebrity duo, Logan Paul, once offered to sell fractionalized ownership of the rare Pikachu Pokémon card on the now-defunct Liquid Marketplace in 2022, prior to the website getting shut down. This drew ire from users online, calling out the YouTuber for running a scam – and it is not the first time.

Delphi Labs general counsel Gabriel Shapiro said on X, the Logan Paul Pikachu NFT fractionalization fiasco is a classic case of "slop tokenization", the token is basically just 'juxtaposed' with property but has no rights to it

In a post on X, Paul explained that he had originally sought to sell a 51% stake in the card on the NFT platform, but only 5.4% of the card was bought. The sales added up to around $270,000, he wrote. He then bought the card back in May 2024 for the same price.

Shortly thereafter, Liquid Marketplace went offline, and users could no longer withdraw their funds. Paul said he personally paid to get the site back up and that users can withdraw their funds at any time.

He has not been as patient when it comes to his other NFTs. X news aggregator WatcherGuru was reportedly blocked by the WWE wrestler after the channel pointed out that Paul purchased an Azuki NFT for $623,000 in 2021, and now its value is down to just $155.

Overall, the NFT market capitalization has fallen by more than 26% over the past year and remains more than $210 billion below its 2021 peak.

Bitcoin's price was trying to hold above $68,000 on Tuesday morning, down 1.4% in the last 23 hours. On Stockwits, retail sentiment around the apex cryptocurrency trended in ‘bearish' territory amid ‘low' levels of chatter.Ethereum's price slid to $1.971, down 0.9% in the last 24 hours, with retail sentiment also trending in the ‘bearish' zone, accompanied by ‘low' levels of chatter. The overall cryptocurrency market cap was down 1% to $2.4 trillion, with liquidations totaling around $220 million, according to CoinGlass data.

The head of Germany's central bank signaled a deliberate shift in Europe's approach to digital money, endorsing euro-denominated instruments as a path to greater autonomy in payments. Joachim Nagel, president of the Deutsche Bundesbank, used remarks at the New Year's Reception of the American Chamber of Commerce in Frankfurt to outline support for both a euro-denominated central bank digital currency (CBDC) and euro-stablecoins for everyday transactions. He noted that EU officials are actively pursuing a retail CBDC and argued that stablecoins pegged to the euro could help Europe “become more independent in terms of payment systems and solutions.” The comments underscore a broader, ongoing debate about how Europe should compete with dollar-based rails in a rapidly evolving digital money landscape.

Market context: The dialogue arrives as Washington accelerates work on a broader regulatory framework for digital assets, including stablecoins, with White House discussions and Senate consideration surrounding the CLARITY Act. The GENIUS Act, referenced in policy discussions, would shape how payment-focused stablecoins are governed in the United States, potentially influencing cross-border competition and global liquidity channels.

At the core of Nagel's remarks is a recognition that Europe cannot rely solely on US-dominated payment rails if it wants to preserve sovereignty over its monetary infrastructure. The Bundesbank chief's emphasis on euro-denominated stablecoins points to a belief that European coins could complement, rather than replace, traditional fiat money by enabling near-instant cross-border transactions at a lower cost. In practical terms, euro-stablecoins could streamline settlement for trade, remittances, and business-to-business payments across the single market and beyond, potentially reducing frictions tied to currency conversion and correspondent banking networks.

Yet the path forward is not without risk. Nagel highlighted that a wholesale CBDC could unlock programmable payments in central bank money, a feature that could transform how financial institutions manage liquidity, settlement risk, and monetary policy transmission. Still, he warned that if USD-denominated stablecoins were to gain outsized market share, European monetary sovereignty could be compromised. Those tensions mirror broader global debates about who controls the rails for a digital, borderless payments landscape and how to balance innovation with financial stability.

The remarks come amid broader regulatory activity in the United States. Lawmakers and White House officials have been meeting with banking and crypto industry representatives ahead of potential votes on legislation such as the CLARITY Act, which seeks to establish a comprehensive framework for digital assets. The GENIUS Act, referenced in various policy discussions, would establish a structured approach to stablecoins and their use in everyday payments. The legislative process is ongoing, with timelines cited for implementation once enacted or once related regulations are finalized. These developments signal a convergence of policy considerations in the United States and Europe as both blocs weigh how best to foster innovation while protecting financial stability.

Against this regulatory backdrop, European institutions have continued to explore practical pilots and market offerings that could align with a euro-centric digital money strategy. The intersection of central bank digital currency planning and private sector stablecoins could yield a spectrum of options for users—from instant, low-cost cross-border transfers to programmable payments anchored in central bank money. The evolution of these ideas will likely depend on how policymakers assess risk, privacy, interoperability, and compatibility with existing monetary policy frameworks.

Europe is rapidly outlining a digital money strategy that blends central bank-issued digital currencies with privately issued, euro-pegged stablecoins. Nagel's remarks reflect a strategic shift: rather than purely adapting existing fiat rails, Europe appears to be exploring digital instruments designed to operate alongside traditional money while offering new capabilities for payments and settlement. The emphasis on euro-denominated stablecoins as a vehicle for cross-border transactions aligns with a broader push to reduce frictions in regional commerce and to avoid overreliance on dollar-based settlement networks. By framing these instruments as potential levers for European sovereignty, Nagel signals that digital money policy is moving from abstract theory to concrete policy design and market testing.

The discussion also underscores the complexity of implementing these tools in a way that preserves financial stability and consumer protections. A wholesale CBDC, with its programmable-money feature set, could enable central banks to automate and tailor payments at scale. Yet such capabilities raise questions about privacy, data governance, and the potential impact on bank balance sheets as settlement rails evolve. While euro-stablecoins could offer efficiency gains for cross-border flows and domestic payments, policymakers will need to weigh currency sovereignty against integration with global markets, ensuring interoperability with existing payment ecosystems and compliance with anti-money-laundering standards.

On the policy front, the United States is actively shaping its own framework for digital assets, and lawmakers have signaled a willingness to adopt a comprehensive regime. The GENIUS Act and related measures aim to provide a clear regulatory pathway, while ongoing White House discussions with financial institutions and crypto firms illustrate the complexity of balancing innovation with risk controls. The timing of these regulatory moves is critical, given the speed at which digital payment technologies are evolving and the possibility that stablecoins could become a dominant cross-border supplier of liquidity if left unregulated or underregulated. In Europe, the path forward will be shaped by the European Central Bank's decisions, national implementations, and the region's ability to coordinate with international standards to ensure compatibility and resilience across the payment ecosystem.

Ultimately, Nagel's comments framing euro-denominated tools as a means to strengthen European autonomy in payments reflect a broader trend: governments are increasingly looking to digital money not merely as a fintech curiosity but as a strategic pillar of monetary sovereignty, financial stability, and competitive positioning in a rapidly digitizing global economy.

Calling nanoscientists: your field needs you to try to replicate a landmark finding that quantum dots can act as biosensors inside living cells. As part of the first large-scale effort in the physical sciences to tackle the reproducibility crisis, researchers in France and the Netherlands are offering funds and resources in exchange for a few months of work.

“We are trying to use replication as a tool to solve a controversy or, you know, to get closer to the truth,” says Raphaël Lévy, a physicist at Sorbonne Paris North University, who co-leads a European project called NanoBubbles, which focuses on self-correction in science. The project — named after bubbles of misinformation that can form when bad science is left uncorrected — made its call for help on 11 February. The appeal comes as separate research groups in psychology and the social sciences prepare to offer updates on their own large-scale replication efforts — prompted by the large number of scientific results that can't be repeated when others run the same tests.

Sometimes, these trials check that the data reported in published papers justify the results and conclusions. In other cases, they repeat the experiments from scratch. Last year, for example, a large-scale reproducibility project in Brazil tried and failed to validate dozens of biomedical studies.

Lévy, one of four researchers who lead the NanoBubbles project, which is backed by an €8-million (US$9.5-million) grant from the European Research Council, wants laboratories to revisit a 2012 study that suggested tiny, fluorescent carbon nanoparticles can detect copper ions inside living cells. This could have medical relevance because high copper levels are linked to diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The paper1, authored by a team led by Yang Tian, a chemist at Tongji University in Shanghai, China, is part of a wider research effort to develop engineered nanoparticles for various applications in imaging, diagnostics and drug delivery.

After pre-registering what they intended to do, the NanoBubbles team has tried and failed to replicate the findings in the paper. “I was really surprised, because in the published protocol, the fluorescence of the particles decreased when the concentration of the target increased, but in our experiments, it just stayed the same,” says Mustafa El Gharib, a nanoscientist also at Sorbonne Paris North University who attempted the replication. Tian did not respond to enquiries from Nature.

There are many possible reasons why work in this field might not replicate, says Wolfgang Parak, a physicist at the University of Hamburg, Germany, who is a member of the NanoBubbles advisory board but was not involved in Gharib's experiments.

As an example, Parak notes that one of his synthesis reactions became hard to reproduce after he moved his lab from the United States to Europe. “Surface chemistry is extremely sensitive to small impurities,” he says, and reagents in different countries could have varying amounts of contamination. Another problem is that experimental protocols sometimes don't describe steps in sufficient detail. So, any study that identifies crucial points in protocols and how to improve them is helpful.

Parak thinks the NanoBubbles replication was done well. “They really measured everything very carefully and used state-of-the-art techniques,” he says. Levy's team described the results in a preprint posted last year2, which is due to be published in Royal Society Open Science.

Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase is a rate-limiting enzyme of de novo pyrimidine synthesis. In most eukaryotes, this enzyme is bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it couples orotate synthesis to ubiquinone reduction. As ubiquinone must be regenerated by respiratory complex III, pyrimidine biosynthesis and cellular respiration are tightly coupled. Consequently, inhibition of respiration suppresses DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Here we show that expression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae URA1 gene (ScURA) in mammalian cells uncouples pyrimidine biosynthesis from mitochondrial electron transport. ScURA forms a homodimer in the cytosol that uses fumarate as an electron acceptor instead of ubiquinone, enabling respiration-independent pyrimidine biosynthesis. Cells expressing ScURA are resistant to drugs that inhibit complex III and the mitochondrial ribosome. Additionally, ScURA enables growth of mitochondrial-DNA-lacking ρ0 cells in uridine-deficient medium and ameliorates the phenotype of cellular models of mitochondrial diseases. Overall, this genetic tool uncovers the contribution of pyrimidine biosynthesis to the phenotypes arising from electron transport chain defects.

Cells obtain pyrimidine nucleotides for DNA and RNA synthesis either by de novo biosynthesis or by salvage of preformed bases1. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) catalyses the fourth step of the biosynthetic pathway: oxidation of dihydroorotate (DHO) to orotate. In most eukaryotes, DHODH is bound to the external surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it uses ubiquinone (UQ) as an electron acceptor. Once UQ is reduced by DHODH, it is re-oxidized by respiratory complex III. Therefore, DHODH activity couples pyrimidine biosynthesis with the mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC)2. The biochemical consequence of this coupling is that de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis is not possible in the absence of mitochondrial electron transport: the failure to re-oxidize UQH2 to UQ causes a build-up in the UQH2/UQ ratio, depleting the pool of UQ that DHODH requires to function. This explains why cells lacking mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or treated with mitochondrial inhibitors affecting complexes III or IV benefit from exogenous uridine supplementation to grow3,4,5,6.

Organisms that are capable of growing in the absence of oxygen must produce orotate through a different mechanism. Here, DHODH is either linked to an alternative ETC or is a cytosolic enzyme that uses either NAD+ or fumarate as electron acceptors7,8,9. In these organisms, pyrimidine biosynthesis can thus proceed independently of cellular respiration. In yeast, the distribution of DHODH isoenzymes across various species appears to mirror their growth preferences: aerobic species harbour a mitochondrial DHODH, whereas facultative anaerobes possess a cytosolic DHODH10. Anaerobic yeasts seem to have acquired the cytosolic DHODH gene by horizontal transfer from a bacterial source and to subsequently have lost their eukaryotic gene11. Oxygen-independent pyrimidine biosynthesis is therefore one of the main adaptations that enabled anaerobic growth12.

The reason why evolution favoured the coupling of pyrimidine biosynthesis with the mETC remains unknown. In this work, we asked whether it is possible to uncouple these two processes in mammalian cells by expressing the gene encoding cytosolic DHODH.

In aerobic eukaryotes, DHODH shuttles electrons through UQ to complex III and functions as a respiratory enzyme13. Other unicellular organisms have evolved different versions of DHODH, which use either fumarate or NAD+ as electron acceptors to oxidize DHO. These isoenzymes typically lack a mitochondrial import signal and a transmembrane domain, residing instead in the cytosol (Fig. 1a).

To enable mETC-independent de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, we ectopically expressed Saccharomyces cerevisiae URA1 gene (ScURA) in mammalian cells (Fig. 1b). The yeast gene's cDNA was codon-optimized for mammalian expression, and a myc tag was added at the carboxyl terminus through a flexible (GGS)3 linker to prevent steric interference between the tag and the enzyme (Supplementary Data). The gene was cloned into a lentiviral vector, and an empty vector was used as the control for all subsequent experiments. In human 143B cells, we were able to detect ScURA expression by western blot (Fig. 1c). Previous studies have shown that S. cerevisiae URA1 is a cytosolic protein that forms homodimers14. Accordingly, when 143B homogenates were separated by native, non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), we observed that ScURA migrated more slowly than expected for its monomeric mass (36 kDa) and toward the expected size of the homodimer (Fig. 1d). When we tested DHODH enzymatic activity in cell homogenates, we found that ScURA-expressing cells possessed 2.25 times more activity than controls (Fig. 1e). Approximately two-thirds of this activity was insensitive to brequinar inhibition, as brequinar targets the UQ binding site of human DHODH, which is not present in ScURA15. Therefore, ScURA expression provides an alternative pathway for DHO dehydrogenation in human cells.

Under normal cell culture conditions, DHODH activity is not a rate-limiting factor for cell proliferation, and exogenous uridine supplementation is unnecessary (Fig. 2a). Consistently, expression of ScURA did not affect cell proliferation or mitochondrial function and morphology in 143B cells (Fig. 2b–d and Extended Data Fig. 1). To test whether ScURA could replace the endogenous DHODH activity in proliferating cells, we treated 143B cells with brequinar and rescued pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibition by supplementing uridine in the growth medium. Brequinar suppressed cell proliferation in control cells, which was fully restored upon uridine supplementation (Fig. 2e). On the other hand, in ScURA-expressing cells, brequinar had no discernible effect on cell proliferation. We next used CRISPR–Cas9 to generate DHODH knockout (KO) 143B cells (Fig. 2f). As expected, these cells required exogenous uridine to proliferate (Fig. 2g). We then reintroduced ScURA, human DHODH (hDHODH) or hDHODH lacking its mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) and the transmembrane domain (hDHODH-ΔMTS) using a lentiviral vector. Re-expression of either hDHODH or ScURA was sufficient to restore uridine-independent cell proliferation, while the hDHODH-ΔMTS variant failed to rescue the phenotype. Furthermore, uridine supplementation offered no additional growth advantage to cells expressing ScURA, demonstrating that it fully compensates for the loss of mitochondrial DHODH. To directly measure the flux through de novo pyrimidine synthesis, we cultured wild-type (WT) and ScURA-expressing cells with [α-15N]glutamine (Fig. 2h), whose nitrogen specifically labels the pyrimidine rings on pyrimidine nucleotides such as uridine triphosphate (UTP) and cytidine triphosphate (CTP). We observed similar rates of UTP and CTP labelling in both cell lines under basal conditions (Fig. 2i,j). Chemical inhibition of DHODH (with brequinar) or of the mETC (with antimycin and myxothiazol) ablated labelling in WT cells. By contrast, ScURA-expressing cells maintained UTP and CTP synthesis in both conditions. These results demonstrate that ScURA enables brequinar-insensitive de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis in human cells by bypassing mitochondrial DHODH.

The dependency of pyrimidine biosynthesis on the mETC was first discovered in chick embryo cells treated with chloramphenicol, which were found to be auxotrophic for uridine5. Chloramphenicol, a mitochondrial ribosome inhibitor, impedes the assembly of respiratory complexes and the ATP synthase, blocking the electron flux through the mETC. Therefore, we investigated whether ScURA expression could restore pyrimidine biosynthesis and rescue cell proliferation in cells treated with chloramphenicol. To this end, we cultured 143B cells in chloramphenicol and uridine for 1 week before assessing their ability to grow without uridine. Although uridine supplementation was essential to maintain proliferation in WT cells, ScURA-expressing cells were able to grow at the same rate in the absence of uridine (Fig. 3a). We next sought to investigate whether ScURA could rescue cell proliferation when ubiquinol oxidation by complex III was disrupted. We treated cells with both antimycin A and myxothiazol to completely block electron flow through complex III16,17,18, rendering cells auxotrophic for uridine3 (Fig. 3b,c). Under these conditions, ScURA expression was able to maintain cell proliferation at the same level as uridine supplementation (Fig. 3b). WT cells treated with antimycin A and myxothiazol could not be maintained past a single passage, in contrast to cells supplemented with uridine or carrying ScURA, which could be kept under complex III inhibition indefinitely. We next used semi-targeted metabolomics to address how ScURA-driven metabolic changes may support proliferation in 143B cells (Fig. 3d,e). ScURA-expressing cells displayed a decrease in DHO and an increase in orotate, which are the substrate and the product of the ScURA reaction, respectively (Fig. 3e,f). Although mETC inhibition in WT cells caused a massive (>600-fold) accumulation of DHO, this metabolite remained below the limit of detection in ScURA-expressing cells under the same conditions (Fig. 3f). The pools of free pyrimidines were decreased when cells expressed ScURA in basal conditions; however, ScURA expression was able to rescue the loss of UTP and CTP caused by mETC inhibition (Fig. 3f). Therefore, ScURA allows mETC-independent de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis in human cells. We also observed accumulation of flavin mononucleotide, the cofactor of ScURA, and a shift in urea cycle intermediates towards arginine synthesis, which is coupled with the production of fumarate, the substrate of ScURA (Fig. 3g). In conclusion, these results support the notion that ScURA restores proliferation upon ETC inhibition largely by supplying pyrimidines.

ScURA takes reducing equivalents from DHO and deposits them onto fumarate instead of UQ, generating succinate, which in turn can then feed the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Therefore, we investigated the impact of this metabolic shift by stable isotope tracing of [U-13C]glutamine (Fig. 4a), which allowed us to track the fate of TCA cycle metabolites. We compared metabolite abundance and labelling patterns between WT and ScURA-expressing cells, both in control conditions and upon acute mETC inhibition. In control conditions, we did not observe any accumulation of succinate in ScURA-expressing cells, probably because succinate can re-enter the TCA cycle and be converted to fumarate by succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) (Fig. 4b). However, the pools of other TCA cycle intermediates changed: α-ketoglutarate, malate and acetyl-CoA increased while citrate decreased, with a consequent increase of the α-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio (Fig. 4b,c and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b), a known determinant of reductive carboxylation19. Accordingly, the labelling pattern of citrate, aspartate and malate changed when ScURA was expressed, indicating reductive carboxylation metabolism (Fig. 4d,e). The above observations fit a model in which de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis is sustained by ScURA by creating a cycle of fumarate and succinate between the cytosol and the mitochondria (Fig. 4a). Given that the ScURA reaction causes a substantial flux of succinate into the TCA cycle, α-ketoglutarate accumulates, increasing the α-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio and driving reductive carboxylation.

Blocking UQH2 oxidation prevents cells from oxidizing succinate, causing it to accumulate. This accumulation may be further increased by SDH reverse activity20,21,22. Here, ScURA expression modified the way succinate is produced: instead of being derived from α-ketoglutarate oxidation as in WT cells ([13C4]succinate or (m+4)), an important fraction of succinate was labelled as [13C3]succinate (m+3), with the labelling characteristic of reductive carboxylation (Fig. 4f). Citrate, malate and aspartate labelling also followed the same pattern. Therefore, the rate of oxidative carboxylation is enhanced in cells expressing ScURA and provides fumarate as an electron acceptor for DHO oxidation. We could not directly quantify fumarate with our metabolomic experiment. Therefore, we used S-(2-succino)-cysteine (2-SC), the product of the reaction between fumarate and cysteine, as a proxy for fumarate labelling (Fig. 4g). The m+3 labelling of 2-SC is consistent with fumarate being produced by reductive carboxylation and becoming the electron acceptor of the reaction catalysed by ScURA (Fig. 4h). ScURA was also able to restore the growth defect caused by mETC inhibition in two cell lines lacking SDH, excluding that ScURA activity depends on fumarate reduction through reverse SDH reaction20 (143B and U2OS SDHAKO; Extended Data Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that cells adjust their TCA flux to compensate for succinate production by ScURA.

We next asked whether ScURA expression leads to changes in gene expression by RNA sequencing. We found that 113 genes were differentially expressed between ScURA and WT cells in basal conditions (adjusted P < 0.05 and absolute log2(fold change) > 1; Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed an enrichment for pathways related to interferon production, hypoxia and cellular responses to oxygen levels (Extended Data Fig. 4c). To identify the regulators driving these changes, we inferred transcription factor activity using decoupleR23. This analysis revealed HIF1α as the most differentially active transcription factor, with a corresponding elevation in a group of its known target genes (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e). This observation is consistent with the finding that cytosolic succinate can stabilize HIF1α24.

The transcriptional impact of ScURA was far more pronounced upon mETC inhibition. In both 143B WT and ScURA-expressing cells, the integrated stress response was activated, with ATF4 being the top induced transcription factor, consistent with previous reports25 (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c), and ScURA-expressing cells activated genes involved in the integrated stress response similarly to WT cells (Extended Data Fig. 5b). We also noted that although the inferred transcriptional activity of MYC was blunted in both lines, the effect was less severe in ScURA-expressing cells, reflecting their sustained proliferation during mETC inhibition. When we analysed differentially expressed genes by gene set enrichment analysis in these conditions, the gene set that clearly stood out was cytoplasmic translation (Extended Data Fig. 5d). Indeed, complex III inhibition led to a profound downregulation of ribosomal protein mRNAs in WT cells. ScURA expression completely rescued this phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 5e). Ribosomal protein downregulation is a recognized consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction25. In the absence of a functional mETC, the shortage of CTP and UTP limits the transcription of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, while ScURA allows ribosomal protein mRNA synthesis by providing an alternative source of pyrimidines.

We next sought to use ScURA in cellular models of mitochondrial diseases. Cells depleted of mtDNA, known as ρ0 cells, are dependent on uridine and pyruvate for growth4. We therefore asked whether we could revert the uridine auxotrophy in ρ0 cells with ScURA. Transduction of two ρ0 cell lines, mouse L929 ρ0 and human 143B ρ0, with the ScURA gene allowed growth in the absence of uridine, while maintaining their pyruvate dependence (Fig. 5a,b and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). In 143B ρ0 cells, ScURA was able to drive DHO oxidation and synthesis of UTP and CTP (Fig. 5c–e). Mitochondrial diseases are a heterogeneous group of maladies with extremely variable clinical manifestations; they are poorly predictable and often lack an effective treatment. Cell lines derived from patients suffering from defects in respiratory complexes benefit from uridine supplementation26. Expression of the alternative oxidase (AOX) from Ciona intestinalis in human 293T cells confers cyanide resistance to cells27. Equally, expression of AOX from Emericella nidulans in mouse L929 ρ0 cells rescues uridine auxotrophy28. In mouse and human cells deficient for complex III or complex IV, AOX can also rescue uridine auxotrophy, ameliorating their metabolic phenotype29,30. In these scenarios, AOX restores the electron flux through the mETC, bypassing respiratory complex III and complex IV, allowing pyrimidine biosynthesis. To examine the implications of ScURA expression in cellular models of mitochondrial diseases, we expressed ScURA in Mt-Cybmut cells, which lack respiratory complex III because of a point mutation in the mtDNA cyb gene3, and in Cox10KO cells, which cannot assemble respiratory complex IV because of the absence of the COX10 assembly factor31 (Extended Data Fig. 6c). ScURA expression enabled the growth of both cell lines in the absence of uridine (Fig. 5f,g and Extended Data Fig. 6d,e). We concluded that the growth defects caused by pathological mutations in mitochondrial genes can be alleviated by ScURA.

The ectopic expression of enzyme orthologs from other phyla has been a valuable tool for investigation of the mETC. For example, Lactobacillus brevis NADH oxidase generates NAD+, bypassing complex I, and has been used extensively both in cellular and animal models32,33. C. intestinalis AOX, which substitutes complex III and IV27, and S. cerevisiae NDI1, which substitutes complex I34, are being explored as therapeutic approaches for mitochondrial diseases5,35. We have extended this genetic toolkit with ScURA, which provides a mETC-independent pathway for orotate production.

The reason why most eukaryotes rely on a mitochondrial DHODH is unknown. The connection between DHODH and mitochondrial electron transport could help to fine-tune key metabolic processes such as DNA and RNA synthesis with oxygen and nutrient availability. When oxygen supply is limited, a reduction in complex III and IV activity would deplete the UQ pool, slowing down pyrimidine biosynthesis and cell growth36. Decreased pyrimidine levels might, in turn, stimulate respiratory supercomplex assembly by ether phospholipid accumulation37. A mitochondrial DHODH might therefore support proliferation only in favourable environments.

Oxidation of DHO is a fundamental reaction for living beings and requires a suitable electron acceptor. In eukaryotes, this process is accomplished mainly by three alternative strategies. Aerobes use oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor, which is reduced by DHODH through the mETC9. In anaerobic eukaryotes, there are two alternative modes of DHO oxidation, both of which use fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor. Many multicellular organisms that inhabit hypoxic environments oxidize DHO by a membrane DHODH, which transfers electrons to rhodoquinone and a membrane-associated fumarate reductase8. Some yeasts, instead, acquired a bacterial DHODH through horizontal gene transfer, which can directly reduce fumarate10. Recently, rhodoquinone has been found in some mammalian tissues, where it can allow mitochondrial electron transport from ubiquinol to fumarate independently of oxygen38. Experiments that combine the expression of ScURA and the induction of rhodoquinone synthesis could shed light on why eukaryotes have maintained membrane-associated reactions throughout evolution, instead of adopting soluble and more direct enzymatic workarounds.

It has been shown that during hypoxia, ubiquinol can be oxidized by reverse SDH activity, allowing DHODH catalysis independently of complex III function20. This pathway can contribute to pyrimidine biosynthesis when complex III is inhibited if exogenous aspartate (or an exogenous electron acceptor such as pyruvate) is given to overcome the deficit in aspartate biosynthesis20,39,40. Given that our experiments were conducted in media complemented with dialysed serum and lacking exogenous aspartate or pyruvate, aspartate deficiency may explain why neither ScURA expression nor uridine supplementation could fully restore cell proliferation to control levels. Further investigation is required to address how nutrient availability constrains the efficacy of metabolic adaptations to respiratory deficiency.

ScURA allowed us to evaluate the contribution of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis to cellular growth independently of cellular respiration. In recent years, genetically engineered mouse models have enabled the study of a wide spectrum of cell-type-specific functions. With this approach, the integrity of the mETC has been shown to be essential for haematopoiesis41, angiogenesis42, regulatory and natural killer T cells functions43 and many more. Such dependence is often assayed by genetic disruption and pharmacologic inhibition of single mitochondrial respiratory complexes. By this approach, the activity of all UQ-dependent dehydrogenases is blocked, raising the question of which mETC-dependent process is responsible for the observed phenotype. The relative contribution of each UQ-dependent pathway can be assessed only by ectopic expression of UQ-independent dehydrogenases in vivo33,42. In this way, the development of effective and precise pharmacological intervention strategies can be undertaken following a precise mechanistic rationale. We designed ScURA following this same logic.

One key issue that we think ScURA will help to disentangle is the metabolic requirements of tumour growth. Human tumour cells in which the integrity of mETC is disrupted cannot form tumours when injected subcutaneously into immunocompromised mice44. However, it has been shown in syngeneic models that tumour cells are able to uptake mtDNA from the host, and pyrimidine biosynthesis has been suggested to be the main limiting factor for their growth45. Interestingly, as it happened with the expression of AOX25, ρ0 cells expressing ScURA still needed pyruvate supplementation to grow, stressing that some activity of the mETC, probably respiratory complex I, is essential. ScURA expression in respiratory-deficient tumour cells will provide a straightforward model to directly test this and other hypotheses in vivo.

A promising future area for the application of ScURA and other ectopic enzymes is in the treatment of mitochondrial diseases through adeno-associated virus gene therapy. For example, expression of NDI1 and AOX has been shown to improve the survival of pre-clinical models of complex I and III deficiencies, respectively35,46. ScURA gene delivery could also be beneficial in patients suffering from Miller's syndrome, a rare genetic disease characterized by mutations in DHODH47.

Cells were grown in complete DMEM medium (D5796, containing 4,500 mg l−1 glucose, 2 mM L-glutamine) supplemented with dialysed 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich, F7524), 1% penicillin–streptomycin (PenStrep, Lonza), at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Where indicated, 50 μg ml−1 uridine and/or 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the growing media. Inhibitors were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as follows: brequinar (2 μM); antimycin A and myxothiazol (20 μM each); and chloramphenicol (40 μg ml−1). Cells were pre-treated with chloramphenicol for 1 week in the presence of uridine to deplete them of respiratory complexes48. Control cells were treated with the appropriate vehicle (ethanol or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)). The origin of cell lines was: ρ0 cells49, Mt-Cybmut and Cox10KO AOX-expressing cells29.

The coding sequence of ScURA was obtained from a previous publication50 and modified as follows. A myc tag was added at the C terminus through a (GGS)3 linker, and at both ends, restriction enzyme sites were inserted. Codon-optimization and oligonucleotide synthesis were performed by Genewiz. The gene was cloned into the pWXLd lentiviral vector (modified from Trono's lab with a puromycin resistance gene, Addgene). Lentivirus production was carried out by the Viral Vector unit at Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC). Viral supernatants were filtered and added to cells with 8 μg ml−1 polybrene overnight. Then, 2 days after transduction, ScURA-expressing cells were selected with puromycin 0.5 μg ml−1 for approximately 1 week until non-transduced cells in a control plate were dead. For each cell line, a cell line transduced with an empty vector was used as a control.

On day 0, a total of 40,000 cells were plated into six-well plates. For each condition, three wells were incubated for 6 h (to allow the cells adhere to the plate), collected and counted. This count was recorded as the number of cells at day 0. For 3–4 days, fresh media and the appropriate treatments were added to each well every day. On the last day, three wells per condition were collected and counted. The number of doublings pre day was calculated as 24 / ((T × (ln2)) / (ln(nf / n0))), where T is time in hours, nf is the number of cells on the final day and n0 is the number of cells at day 0.

Cells from two to ten 150 mm plates were collected with trypsin, washed in PBS and resuspended in cold sucrose buffer (0.32 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4). Cells were then homogenized in a Teflon potter-type tissue homogenizer with 20–40 ‘pops'. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000g for 5 min, the nuclear pellet was discarded and the post-nuclear whole-cell homogenate was stored at −80 °C. When mitochondria were isolated, the whole-cell homogenate obtained was further centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min. The pellet obtained was resuspended in sucrose buffer and stored at −80 °C.

DHODH activity was measured following a previously published method51, with some modifications: 100 µg of whole-cell homogenates were used for each reaction in a final volume of 200 µl. Each biological replicate was split into three technical replicates. DHODH-dependent reduction of 2,6-dichloroindophenol (DCPIP) was measured with a UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a 96-well plate reader. Samples were resuspended in reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM KCl, 3 mM KCN, 0.05 mM DCPIP, 0.25 mM decylubiquinone, pH 7.5) and incubated for 2 min at 37 °C. The reaction was started by the addition of 1 mM DHO. The first 3 min of the reaction were linear and were used for the analysis. The rate of background (DHODH-independent) DCPIP reduction was measured in parallel by omitting DHO from the reaction mixture and was subtracted from the DHO-dependent rate for each sample. Brequinar was added where indicated at 0.05 mM; controls were treated with the same volume of DMSO.

All gels were prepared in-house with Tris-HCl buffer and acrylamide/bis. Protein samples were quantified and loaded on the gel, and electrophoresis was performed in Tris-glycine solution. For denaturing electrophoresis, 0.1% SDS was added to the gels and protein samples were incubated for 1 min at 95 °C in loading buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromophenol blue) before loading. For non-denaturing native gels, SDS was not added to the gel, whole-cell homogenates were not boiled and the loading buffer used did not contain SDS or β-mercaptoethanol.

Proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane (Immobilon-FL, 0.45 μm) by transfer in BioRad Mini Trans-Blot Cell or Trans-Blot Cell systems, in 48 mM Tris, 39 mM glycine and 20% methanol transfer solution overnight at 30 V. The membrane was then blocked in 0.1% PBS-Tween, 5% BSA solution for 1 h at room temperature (22 °C) and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. After that, the membrane was incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Membrane development was performed using fluorescent secondary antibody and revealed with the Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). Antibodies used included anti-hemoagglutinin-tag (1:5,000; Sigma-Aldrich, sAB 4300603), anti-betaActin (1:10,000; Sigma-Aldrich, A2066), anti-GAPDH (1:5,000; Abcam, AB8245) and anti-SDHA (1:5,000; Invitrogen, 459200 or Proteintech, 14865-1-AP).

The procedure was carried out as detailed previously48. In brief, 100 μg of mitochondria were incubated with 400 μg of digitonin for 5 min in 50 mM NaCl buffer, 50 mM imidazole, 5 mM aminocaproic acid at a final concentration of 10 μg μl−1. Electrophoresis was performed in a cold chamber and developed for 30 min at 90 V with cathode buffer A. Then, the cathode buffer was exchanged for cathode buffer B, and electrophoresis continued for approximately 1 h more at 300 V. Measurement of NADH dehydrogenase activity of complex I was determined on the same gel after blue native–PAGE electrophoresis by incubating the gel in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.14 mM NADH and 1 mg ml−1 NitroBlue tetrazolium solution at room temperature.

ATP synthesis was assessed as previously described52. In brief, 1.5 billion cells were permeabilized with digitonin and ATP synthesis was assayed using glutamate plus malate or succinate as fuels in the presence of adenosine 5′-diphosphate and diadenosine pentaphosphate (to inhibit the adenylyl kinase) by a kinetic luminescence assay using the luciferin–luciferase reaction.

A total of 10,000 cells were plated in a Seahorse XF96 microplate the day before the assay. Cells were washed in MAS medium (70 mM sucrose, 220 mM mannitol, 5 mM KH2PO4, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM HEPES pH 7.4) containing 0.2% w/v free fatty acid BSA and then placed in MAS media containing ADP and digitonin (4 mM and 10 µg ml−1 final concentrations, respectively), incubated for 3 min at 37 °C and then loaded in the instrument. Substrate injection was as follows: glutamate + malate (5 mM each, port A); rotenone (2 µM, port B); succinate (5 mM, port C); antimycin A (1 µM, port D). These conditions allow for the determination of the respiratory capacity of mitochondria through complex I and complex II. For measuring activities of mitochondrial complexes, frozen–thawed cells were used as previously detailed53.

The amino acid sequence of DHODH from various species was retrieved from UniProt. The R packages msa54, ape55 and ggmsa56 were used for multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree construction and generation.

In total, 20,000 cells were seeded per well on a 12-well plate containing previously sterilized precision cover glasses (Marienfeld, 0117520) and left incubating at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in their corresponding medium. After 48 h, cells were fixed for 15 min at 37 °C in pre-warmed 4% paraformaldehyde (ThermoFisher, 043368.9M) diluted in 1× PBS, followed by three washes in 1× PBS. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X100 in 1× PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked in 2% BSA (w/v) in 1× PBS, then incubated with a Tomm20-CL488 antibody (1:500) (Proteintech, 30235116) diluted in blocking buffer. Cells were then incubated in Alexa Fluor 405 N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester (1:5,000) (ThermoFisher, A30000) diluted in 1× PBS. All incubation steps were performed for 40 min at room temperature and followed by three 5 min washes in 1× PBS-Tween 0.1%. Samples were finally mounted on microscopy slides using ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent (Invitrogen, P36934).

All microscopy images were collected on a Leica SP5 inverted confocal microscope equipped with a HCX PL APO λ blue ×63, 1.40 NA oil objective. Z-stacks containing 10 planes (with a step size of 0.34 µm) were acquired in a sequential line scanning mode using LAS-AF (v.2.6.0) software (Leica Microsystems) at a digital zoom of ×2, pixel size of 60 nm, scanner speed of 200 Hz and 3 line averages, with a pinhole size of 1 AU. The Tomm20 signal was excited using the Argon 488 laser line at 10% intensity, and the corresponding 505–555 nm emission was collected using a PMT detector set at 800 V gain and −0.1% offset. The NHS405 signal was excited using the UV diode 405 laser line at 2% intensity, and 420–485 nm emission was collected using a PMT detector at 900 V gain and −1% offset.

Image analysis was mainly performed in FIJI 1.53t. Z-stacks were first projected into a single plane using the maximum intensity method. For mitochondria, the signal of Ch2 (NHS405) was subtracted to that of Ch1 (Tomm20-CL488) and the resulting image was then thresholded with the Mitochondria Analyzer plugin57 using the following parameters: remove particles (size, ≤0.1 µm2), subtract background (rolling, 2.0), sigma filter plus (radius, 2.0), enhance local contrast (max slope, 3.0), weighted mean threshold (block size, 1.45; C-value, 5.0) and despeckle and remove outliers (pixels, 4.0). Individual networks were isolated from whole thresholded images, and morphology parameters of mitochondria were calculated on a per-cell basis. For analysis of cell morphology, the NHS405 channel was first pre-processed in FIJI by applying CLAHE (block, 500; bin, 256; slope, 10) and a Gaussian blur (radius, 0.3 µm). The objects were then thresholded and their morphology analysed in Cellprofiler (v.4.2.8)58 using an adaptive Otsu method with three classes.

U2OS (ATCC, HTB-96) and 143B (ATCC, CRL-8303) SDHAKO clonal cell lines were generated through nucleofection (Neon transfection system, Invitrogen) of ribonucleoprotein complexes prepared by incubating 2 µg of TrueCut Cas9 Protein v2 (Invitrogen, A36499) and 2 µg of a pair of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) (sgRNA 1 target sequence at intron 1, AACCCTGAAGGCAGCCCAAG; sgRNA 2 target sequence at exon 4, GGGCCTGCTCCGTCATGTAG). DNA oligonucleotides used for sgRNA synthesis were designed using the CRISPOR algorithm (http://crispor.tefor.net), and sgRNAs were synthesized using the GeneArt Precision gRNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, A29377). Nucleofection was carried out at 1230 V or 1300 V (four pulses of 10 ms) for U2OS or 143B cells, respectively. Following nucleofection, cells were seeded into six-well plates and allowed to recover for 48 h. For single-cell clone isolation, cells were sorted using a spectral cell sorter (Cytek Aurora CS). Genomic DNA was extracted, and a pair of primers (primer 1A, GAGTGTGCATCCGACATCCTC; primer 2A, CTCATCACCATTCTTTTGGCTG) flanking SDHA-targeted regions was used to perform PCR screening. Clones were considered positive for gene editing when the amplified product was 551 bp, indicating deletion of the whole DNA fragment between targeted regions. The absence of SDHA protein was confirmed by western blot against SDHA (Santa Cruz, sc-166909), performed following separation of total cell protein extracts on 10% SDS–PAGE gels. Positive clones were further validated by Sanger sequencing of the SDHA gene.

A clonal 143B-DHODHKO cell line was generated by following a previously published protocol59, with slight modifications. Each pair of gene-specific sgRNAs (pair 1, CCGCGGAGGACTACGCAGAA; pair 2, ATAGAAACGCTCATCTCCCG) targeting different regions of the gene was cloned into a TCLV2 plasmid (Addgene, 87360)60. Lentiviral particles were made in the Viral Vectors Unit at CNIC. All 143B cells were seeded on six-well plates, and at 80% confluency, they were transduced with lentiviral particles in DMEM supplemented with only 2% FBS, which was changed the following day for fresh complete medium. After 48 h, infected cells were selected by treatment with 1 µg ml−1 puromycin in complete DMEM. After 48 h, surviving cells were treated with 2 µg ml−1 doxycycline to induce Cas9-2A-eGFP expression and were then sorted into a 96-well plate at one cell per well using a FACSAria cell sorter. Final clones were selected by observing cell death in medium lacking uridine and confirmed by running total cell protein extracts on a 12.5% SDS–PAGE gel and performing a western blot against DHODH (1:1,000) (Santa Cruz, sc166348).

The 143B-DHODHKO cells were used to re-express a WT version of hDHODH, a version of the protein lacking the mitochondria peptide signal and the transmembrane alpha helix (hDHODHΔMTS) and codon-optimized ScURA protein fused to a c-Myc tag (ScURA-myc). The vectors used were constructed and packaged by VectorBuilder, and the lentiviral particles were generated by the Viral Vectors Unit at CNIC. 143B-DHODHKO cells were seeded on six-well plates, and at 80% confluency, they were transduced with lentiviral particles in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, which was changed the following day for fresh complete medium containing uridine. Infected cells were selected by treatment with 400 µg ml−1 hygromycin B for at least 4 days. Re-expression of the proteins was confirmed by running total cell protein extracts on a 12.5% SDS–PAGE gel and performing a western blot against DHODH (1:1,000) (Santa Cruz, sc166348) and c-myc (1:5,000).

For each condition, cells were seeded in six-well plates (with one plate kept aside for cell counting) in DMEM + 10% dialysed FBS, no uridine. The day after seeding, media containing inhibitors (1 μM each antimycin and myxothiazol, 2 μM brequinar) and radio-labelled tracers (2 mM [α-15N]glutamine or [U-13C]glutamine; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) were added. After 24 h of incubation, metabolites were extracted in metabolite extraction buffer (50% methanol, 30% acetonitrile, 20% water (all liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry grade), 5 µM valine-d8, CK isotopes and DLM-488). Cells were washed with PBS, and 500 μl of cold metabolite extraction buffer per million cells was added to the wells; the plate was then immediately placed at −80 °C for 20 min. The cell lysate–extraction buffer solution mixture was shaken at maximum speed for 15 min at 4 °C, centrifuged at 13,000g for 30 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was collected in a HPLC vial. A pooled sample was prepared by taking 15 μl from each individual sample.

Metabolites were separated on a Millipore SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC analytical column (5 µm, 2.1 × 150 mm) coupled to a guard column (2.1 × 20 mm, 5 µm). The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (20 mM ammonium carbonate with 2.5 µM medronic acid, adjusted to pH 9.7 with ammonium hydroxide) and solvent B (acetonitrile in water, 95:5, v/v). The column oven was maintained at 40 °C, and the autosampler was kept at 4 °C. Chromatography was performed at a flow rate of 0.20 ml min−1 with the following gradient programme: 0–2 min, 85% B; 2–14 min, linear decrease to 30% B; 14–15 min, isocratic at 30% B; 15–17.1 min, re-equilibration to 85% B; and 17.1–23 min, hold at 85% B.

Metabolite quantification was performed on a Vanquish Horizon UHPLC system coupled to an Orbitrap Exploris 120/240 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a heated electrospray ionization source. Ionization parameters were set to +3.5 kV for positive mode and −2.8 kV for negative mode, with an RF lens setting of 70, a heated capillary temperature of 320 °C and an auxiliary gas heater temperature of 280 °C. Sheath gas flow was set to 40, auxiliary gas to 15 and sweep gas was disabled. For MS1 acquisition, data were collected in full scan mode over a mass range of m/z = 70–900, using a standard automatic gain control target with an automatically determined maximum injection time. Data were acquired with polarity switching at an Orbitrap resolution of 120,000. Untargeted metabolite profiling was performed using the AcquireX Deep Scan workflow with iterative data-dependent acquisition on pooled samples. Full scans were acquired at a resolution of 60,000, with tandem mass spectrometry fragmentation at 30,000 resolution and a minimum intensity threshold of 5.0 × 103. Dynamic exclusion was triggered after a single event (10 s, ±5 ppm), and precursors were isolated with a 1.2 m/z window. Stepped higher-energy collisional dissociation energies of 30, 50 and 150 were applied, with mild trapping enabled to improve signal quality.

Metabolite identification was performed using Compound Discoverer (v.3.2; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Compounds were assigned based on precursor m/z values within 5 ppm of the theoretical mass, fragment ion matches within 5 ppm to an internal spectral library of authentic standards analysed under identical data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry conditions (minimum match score of ≥70), and retention times within 5% of those of purified standards under the same chromatographic conditions. Peak area integration and chromatogram evaluation were carried out in TraceFinder (v.5.1; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and isotopologue distributions were corrected for natural isotope abundance using the AccuCor package61.

Features were filtered using the 80% modified rule62, followed by exclusion of metabolites with a coefficient of variation of >30% in pooled quality control samples63. These filtering steps retain stable metabolites consistently detected in the samples, thereby preserving only robust and reproducible features. Intensities were normalized to the valine-d8 internal standard to correct for sample-to-sample technical variations, followed by LOESS signal correction to account for a systematic run order-dependent drift. Missing values were imputed with the group mean, while features entirely absent in a group were substituted with half of the minimum detected intensity in the dataset. Subsequently, data were log2-transformed to stabilize variance and improve normality before statistical analysis. Principal component analysis was performed using the prcomp function from the R stats package64, and Hotelling's T2 test was applied to identify sample outliers using the qcc package65. Sample group differential abundance was assessed using two-sided Student's t-tests, and P values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg method from the R base stats package. Finally, readxl66 and tidyverse were used for general scripting67.

RNA sequencing was performed by the CNIC Genomics Unit team. RNA libraries were produced using the Illumina TruSeq RNASeq kit and sequenced in an Illumina HiSeq 2500 Sequencer. Downstream analysis was performed using the nf-core/rnaseq analysis pipeline68 using Nextflow (v.24.10.5). In brief, following quality control with FastQC, adaptor sequences were removed using Trim Galore! The cleaned reads were then aligned to the Homo sapiens reference genome (GRCh38, Ensembl release 104) using the STAR aligner. Transcript-level abundances were quantified with Salmon, and gene-level read counts were generated using featureCounts. Raw counts were normalized using the variance stabilizing transformation function, and differential gene expression analysis was performed within the DESeq2 package69. P values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using clusterProfiler70 with statistics obtained from DESeq2. Transcription factor activity was inferred with decoupleR23 (univariate linear model), with DoRothEA regulons71. We filtered for regulons with a high level of confidence (‘A'). Generation of heatmaps and figures was done in R using the pheatmap package.

Data are presented as mean ± s.d. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 10. The statistical tests used, sample size and post hoc corrections are indicated in the figure legends. All statistical tests were two-tailed and had an alpha of 0.05 as the significance threshold. *P < 0.05. No data were excluded.

In our three-dimensional space, elementary particles neatly filter into either bosons or fermions. But in lower dimensions, that distinction gets a bit murky.

Here's what you'll learn when reading this story:

When you drill down into the very fabric of reality—where elementary particles make up the matter that is you and me and everything around us in three-dimensional space—things get divided nicely into two categories: fermions and bosons. These two categories of particles are defined primarily by their atomic spin (in quantum mechanical terms), with bosons (photons, gluons, Higgs boson, W bosons, and Z bosons) having integer spin values and fermions (protons, neutrons, electrons, neutrinos) having half-integer spin values. While two bosons can occupy the same quantum state (which is why photons can pass through each other), two fermions can not—a good thing, since if they could, you'd fall through the floor right now.

But as is true of most things in science, things don't always line up so neatly. For example, for half a century, scientists have known  about the anyon, which exists in two-dimensional space. This quasiparticle is essentially anything between a boson and a fermion, which explains why American physicist Frank Wilczek named them “any-ons,” or simply anyons. However, it wasn't until 2020 that these weird particles were observed experimentally in one-atom thick (two-dimensional) semiconductors. “We had bosons and fermions, and now we've got this third kingdom,” Wilczek said at the time. “It's absolutely a milestone.”

Now, scientists from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) and the University of Oklahoma report the existence of a one-dimensional system in which anyons can exist. In two separate papers—both published in the journal Physical Review A—the researchers describe the recipe for adjustable anyons and their theoretical properties, exploring a new corner of this “third kingdom” of elementary particles. 

“Every particle in our universe seems to fit strictly into two categories: bosonic or fermionic. Why are there no others?” Thomas Busch, a co-author of both studies from OIST, said in a press statement. “With these works, we've now opened the door to improving our understanding of the fundamental properties of the quantum world and it's very exciting to see where theoretical and experimental physics take us from here.”

Anyons only exist in lower dimensions because, to put it very simply, particles in those dimensions have fewer options for moving around. Raúl Hidalgo-Sacoton (a Ph.D. student at OIST) describes the “exchange factor” that exists in 3D space—the property demanding that when two electrons swap places, they must obey a simple rule governing the mathematical statistics of the event: Its square must be equal to 1, meaning that all particles are either -1 (fermions) or 1 (bosons). 

In two dimensions, however, it's not so simple: “To satisfy the law of indistinguishability, we need exchange factors over a continuous range to account for the exchange, dependent on the exact twists and turns of the paths,” Hidalgo-Sacoto said in a press statement. And whatever lies in that range between -1 and 1 is considered an anyon. 

In this study, Busch, Hidalgo-Sacoto, and their colleague Doerte Blume (from the University of Oklahoma) found that this boson-fermion binary remains broken in one dimension, and they even discovered a method to specifically tune the exchange factor. Because of their limited movement in one dimension, particles must pass through each other, and this causes the exchange factor to differ from higher dimensions. This is likely connected to the strength of the short-range interaction between the particles. 

“We've identified not only the possibility of existence of one-dimensional anyons, but we've also shown how their exchange statistics can be mapped,” Busch said in a press statement. “We're thrilled to see what future discoveries are made in this area, and what it can tell us about the fundamental physics of our universe.”

The ‘Ain Braq aqueduct, which runs through the Jabal al-Madhbah massif into Petra, was even more sophisticated than scientists previously believed.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The importance of finding water supplies in a harsh desert climate is a central theme in Frank Herbert's classic science-fiction novel Dune (and in its latest film adaptation by Denis Villeneuve). Rising from dusty sands and carved out of red sandstone, Jordan's ancient city of Petra is reminiscent of the desert landscapes and stone edifices of Herbert's faraway science-fiction desert planet. But Petra already had aqueducts and water systems thousands of years ago that were far ahead of any on fictional Arrakis—so no one in Petra ever needed a stillsuit to survive.

Petra was an urban hub of the ancient world despite its location in a semiarid climate that brought hardly any rain. It stood as the capital of the Nabatean kingdom until it became part of the Roman province of Arabia in the early 2nd century C.E. As an important administrative and trading center, Petra needed water for purposes beyond keeping its people alive. Its hydraulic systems filled baths, kept gardens and agriculture thriving, gushed from a sacred fountain known as a nymphaeum, and filled up basins in temples, sanctuaries, and tombs. Now, on the abandoned city's southeast edge, archaeologists have discovered that the ‘Ain Braq aqueduct running through the Jabal al-Madhbah massif into Petra was even more sophisticated than they previously believed. 

As part of a 2023 excavation conducted as part of the Urban Development of Ancient Petra project, a research team led by Niklas Jungmann of the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin studied the system that brought water into Petra. These included cisterns, basins, a reservoir with a dam, and the ‘Ain Braq aqueduct. In the course of their research, Jungmann and his team discovered something that the aqueduct had been hiding for millennia. It featured not just one, but two different main conduits that kept water flowing into Petra. Researchers had long known about the first channel lined with terracotta pipes to carry water into the city. What the researchers didn't expect was to unearth the imprint of a second conduit that once held a pressurized lead pipeline supplying water to basins and reservoirs on az-Zantur hill.

“The discovery of numerous water structures on the plateau directly above the rock slopes with the presumed aqueduct channel and the dam, raised broader questions about the engineering and chronology of this area,” Jungmann said in a study recently published in Levant. “As [the existence of a second conduit] was not mentioned in prior research, examining how the aqueduct entered the city became a primary research objective.”

Measuring roughly 380 feet (116 meters) in length, the newly-discovered pipeline used a welded metal pipe that was made of lead and encased in mortar. Further evidence that the Nabateans used a lead pipe in the second conduit includes its significantly larger diameter compared to the terracotta pipes found in the area, and the regular surface of the imprint it left behind in the underlying stone, as opposed to the irregular surface imprint typical of channels that held terracotta pipes. A later excavation backed this hypothesis when Nabatean conduit blocks were discovered during a survey of the city center. In the hardened mortar was section of lead pipe, whose imprint texture and dimensions matched those of the earlier find and left no more doubts about the overall composition of the aqueduct's second main conduit.

Jungmann concluded that such a long and narrow lead pipe was probably used as an inverted siphon within the ‘Ain Braq aqueduct. It was buried in concrete to transport water beneath the city, bypassing obstacles on the surface. Water in the system would have flowed through a header tank before entering the aqueduct's two conduits. Previously, one theory posited that the conduit could have taken a detour to supply water to another part of the city before arriving at its destination. However, the conduit was found to head west, probably to reach the reservoirs of az-Zantur hill. A detour would have not even been viable, since only an uninterrupted pipeline that generates enough internal pressure can allow water in a siphon to run from the header tank to the basin or reservoir it was meant to fill. 

“Overall, this study underscores the potential for further research into Nabataean water management,” said Jungmann. “While some hypotheses about the aqueduct's two branches into the city have been proposed above, more fieldwork is required in order to provide a fuller understanding of the distribution system and its evolution over time.”

One of Simon Clark's most popular TikTok videos begins with him playing the part of a clueless climate contrarian. Adopting the overconfident tone that is common among social-media influencers, he proclaims: “Renewables are a scam!”

The ‘PhD influencers' logging lab life on TikTok and Instagram

Cut to the real Clark, who has a PhD in stratospheric dynamics and uses the handle @simonoxfphys, as he dismantles several myths about renewable energy using a deadpan style and a torrent of charts. The video, with almost 180,000 views, is an effort to fight misinformation by meeting people where they are, he says.

Clark started making YouTube videos more than 15 years ago as a master's student in physics at the University of Oxford, UK. He wanted to help others learn about getting into elite universities and navigating the collegiate system. After he got his PhD from the University of Exeter, UK, he decided to make content creation a full-time career. “The natural thing in my field was talking about the climate crisis,” he says, “the physical causes behind it, the solutions we have to it, and increasingly at the moment, why we aren't implementing those solutions.”

Clark is now also on Instagram, Facebook and the live-streaming service Twitch, where he leans on his scientific credentials to both communicate science and combat misinformation. He is one of many scientists and medical experts who are countering the flood of anti-science advice and rhetoric across social-media platforms.

According to a 2025 report by the Reuters Institute in Oxford and the University of Oxford, 65% of people worldwide now consume video on social media1. Increasingly, many individuals, especially young people, get their news from these platforms. But a lot of that ‘news' is created by anti-science influencers who build loyal followings, using their position as opinion leaders to promote climate denialism, conspiracy theories, vaccine scepticism, autism myths, sham treatments and other pseudoscience.

A study last year, for example, analysed nearly 1,000 Instagram and TikTok posts about controversial medical screening tests. It found that the posts were overwhelmingly misleading — and that the people posting often had financial interests in the treatment2. Another study analysed the 100 most popular TikTok videos on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and found more than half to be misleading3. Yet the videos collectively had more than 280 million views.

To counteract this deluge of bad information, Clark and other pro-science content creators are taking strategies straight out of the influencer playbook.

Social scientist Louisa Ha at Bowling Green State University in Ohio says that content creators who intend to mislead use clear tactics: “They pretend to be authentic, trustworthy and knowledgeable,” she says. They blend facts with misinformation to make it hard to tell what is credible. “The best lie is one that mixes seemingly authoritative sources and some facts with false data and false arguments and appeals to people's beliefs and fears,” says Ha.

Whether a video provokes people to engage with it matters more than the video's accuracy, or even whether people agree with it, says Clark. The longer people linger on a video and the more they comment, the more likely it is that lots of people will see it.

Can giant surveys of scientists fight misinformation on COVID, climate change and more?

Encouraging such engagement is a tactic that Clark uses. In 2020, he made a 40-minute YouTube video on the debate over nuclear power, focusing on why some people see it as the best low-carbon technology whereas others say the risk of catastrophe is too great. He knew that the topic would be controversial. “I imagine that no matter what I say, I'm about to piss a lot of people off,” he says in the video. And he was right: it has more than 500,000 views, and nearly 6,000 comments.

Comments tend to be highly valued by engagement algorithms. Some creators do simple things, such as wearing a shirt backwards, so that viewers will post a comment pointing it out, says Clark. “It's stupid”, he says, “but it works, so I guess it's not stupid.”

Misinformation abounds in the health and wellness space. As a registered dietician, Megan Rossi was struck by how many of her patients took diet advice from blogs and other online content. Frustrated by the lack of good science information, she started her own gut-health focused Instagram account @theguthealthdoctor in 2015, featuring video explainers about topics such as bloating, fibre, exercise and sleep, as well as offering recipe suggestions. (She has also developed a food brand and started a company that sells live bacteria supplements.)

Rossi leans into her credibility as a research fellow in nutritional sciences at King's College London, often referring to herself as a “gut specialist/dietician”. She says that she's careful to give advice based only on peer-reviewed evidence, and she typically cites her sources. Commenters often say things such as “very helpful” and “great info”, and thank her for not engaging in fearmongering.

The advent of social media has created communities that can more easily connect across time and space, and so has introduced a new type of opinion leader, says Amelia Burke-Garcia, director of the Center for Health Communication Science at the University of Chicago in Illinois. What's important, says Burke-Garcia, who has been working with influencers in the public-health space since 2008 (“although we didn't call them influencers then”), is to support credible voices and evidence in these communities.

How to speak to a vaccine sceptic: research reveals what works

In a qualitative study published last year, Burke-Garcia, public-health researcher Amy Leader at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and their colleagues asked ten influencers of colour who had children aged 9 to 14 to spread the word about vaccination against human papillomavirus4. The influencers, whom the researchers provided with a fact sheet, created emotionally charged posts that acknowledged parents' fears and used storytelling to describe their personal journeys towards a vaccination decision. Surveys of people who follow these influencers, Burke-Garcia says, revealed that the followers were more likely to consider vaccinating their children after hearing from someone to whom they could relate.

This relatability can help content creators to grow a loyal following. UK creator Emanuel Wallace, better known as Big Manny (@big.manny1), says that relatability, as well as authenticity, have been fundamental to his work. In his efforts to make chemistry and other science topics fun and accessible to young people, he has gained more than two million TikTok followers — and has made videos on the platform with Prince William and with Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown.

His videos show him doing science demonstrations ranging from standard classroom ones — what happens when you burn magnesium — to those requiring sophisticated set-ups and equipment. One video shows a chicken breast being exposed to the insides of a lithium battery. “This chicken breast represents you,” he says, before it bursts into flames. It's a powerful warning about the dangers of swallowing a lithium battery.

His expertise as a former secondary-school science technician comes through, even with his casual approach: “I don't really look like a typical scientist. I don't wear a lab coat. Sometimes I might have a tracksuit on. And I use colloquial terms in my speech,” he says. “I just be myself.”

When it comes to fighting misinformation, content creators take various approaches. Clark favours “pre-bunking” rather than debunking, which he finds less effective. He tries to reach a broad audience with solid facts that leave no room for ambiguity: “This is like vaccinating them against misinformation”.

Others have gained a reputation for challenging misinformation head-on. Russian–American creator Mikhail Varshavski, better known online as Doctor Mike (@doctormike), spends half of his week as a family-medicine physician and the other half creating content for his 14.6 million YouTube, 5.3 million Instagram and 2.7 million TikTok followers. He aims his content not just at people who agree with him, but also at those who haven't thought much about their health care, who have been hurt by the system or even who disagree with modern medicine.

Mountain photographer stumbles on one of the largest ever collections of Triassic dinosaur prints

A newfound site in the Italian Alps holds one of the largest collections of Triassic dinosaur footprints ever seen

By Humberto Basilio edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

About 2,000 fossil footprints appear on this part of the mountain site's walls, researchers say.

Last September photographer Elio Della Ferrera spotted thousands of dinosaur tracks traversing vertical rock faces in the Fraele Valley of Stelvio National Park, high in the Italian Alps. Some of the prints, spanning as many as 40 centimeters across, date back about 210 million years, making the newly identified site one of the richest deposits of Triassic dinosaur tracks in the world.

The footprints are so well preserved that “it took me a few seconds to realize the photos were real,” says paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso of the Natural History Museum of Milan, who is leading the investigation of the site. “Now we can go back in time and study the evolution of dinosaurs in this place.”

In a preliminary study, Dal Sasso and his team deduced that the prints were made by herds of large, herbivorous dinosaurs, probably prosauropods, ancestors of Jurassic sauropods such as Brontosaurus.

Studying this newly named “Triassic Park” will be challenging because it is so difficult to access, Dal Sasso says—researchers will have to rely on drones and remote sensing to study and digitally preserve the footprints.

Some of the best-preserved fossilized footprints at the newfound site show impressions of the Triassic walkers' long heels, toes and claws.

AI enters the exam room

When alerts misfire or can't explain themselves, nurses still carry the risk

By Hilke Schellmann edited by Eric Sullivan

Tavis Coburn

Adam Hart has been a nurse at St. Rose Dominican Hospital in Henderson, Nev., for 14 years. A few years ago, while assigned to help out in the emergency department, he was listening to the ambulance report on a patient who'd just arrived—an elderly woman with dangerously low blood pressure—when a sepsis flag flashed in the hospital's electronic system.

Sepsis, a life-threatening response to infection, is a major cause of death in U.S. hospitals, and early treatment is critical. The flag prompted the charge nurse to instruct Hart to room the patient immediately, take her vitals and begin intravenous (IV) fluids. It was protocol; in an emergency room, that often means speed.

But when Hart examined the woman, he saw that she had a dialysis catheter below her collarbone. Her kidneys weren't keeping up. A routine flood of IV fluids, he warned, could overwhelm her system and end up in her lungs. The charge nurse told him to do it anyway because of the sepsis alert generated by the hospital's artificial-intelligence system. Hart refused.

A physician overheard the escalating conversation and stepped in. Instead of fluids, the doctor ordered dopamine to raise the patient's blood pressure without adding volume—averting what Hart believed could have led to a life-threatening complication.

What stayed with Hart was the choreography that the AI-generated alert produced. A screen prompted urgency, which a protocol turned into an order; a bedside objection grounded in clinical reasoning landed, at least in the moment, as defiance. No one was acting in bad faith. Still, the tool pushed them to comply when the evidence right in front of them—the patient and her compromised kidneys—demanded the exact opposite. (A hospital spokesperson said that they could not comment on a specific case but that the hospital views AI as “one of the many tools that supports, not supersedes, the expertise and judgment of our care teams.”)

That dynamic is becoming familiar in U.S. health care. Over the past several years hospitals have woven algorithmic models into routine practice. Clinical care often relies on matching a patient's symptoms against rigid protocols—an environment ideal for automation. For an exhausted workforce, the appeal of handing off routine tasks such as documentation to AI is undeniable.

The technologies already implemented span a spectrum from predictive models that calculate simple risk scores to agentic AI that promises autonomous decision-making—enabling systems to titrate a patient's oxygen flow or reprioritize an ER triage queue with little human input. A pilot project launched in Utah a few months ago uses chatbot technology with agentic capabilities to renew prescriptions, a move proponents say gives providers more time, although physician associations have opposed the removal of human oversight. Across the country, health systems are using similar tools to flag risks, ambiently listen to visits with patients, generate clinical notes, monitor patients via wearable devices, match participants to clinical trials, and even manage the logistics of operating rooms and intensive care unit transfers.

Nurses saw how an imperfect product could become policy—and then become their problem.

The industry is chasing a vision of truly continuous care: a decision-making infrastructure that keeps tabs on patients between appointments by combining what's in the medical record—laboratory test results, imaging, notes, meds—with population data and with the data people generate on their own by using, for instance, wearables and food logs. It watches for meaningful changes, sends guidance or prompts, and flags cases that need human input. Proponents argue this kind of data-intensive, always-on monitoring is beyond the cognitive scope of any human provider.

Others say clinicians must stay in the loop, using AI not as autopilot but as a tool to help them make sense of vast troves of data. Last year Stanford Medicine rolled out ChatEHR, a tool that allows clinicians to “chat” with a patient's medical records. One physician shared that the tool found critical information buried in the records of a cancer patient, which helped a team including six pathologists to give a definitive diagnosis. “If that doesn't prove the value of EHR, I don't know what does,” they reported.

At the same time, on many hospital floors these digital promises often fracture, according to Anaeze Offodile, chief strategy officer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. He notes that faulty algorithms, poor implementation and low return on investment have caused some projects to stall. On the ground, nurses, who are tasked with caring for patients, are increasingly wary of unvalidated tools. This friction has moved from the ward into the streets. In the past two years nurses in California and New York City have staged demonstrations to draw attention to unregulated algorithmic tools entering the health-care system, arguing that while hospitals invest in AI the bedside remains dangerously short-staffed.

Sepsis prediction has become a cautionary case. Hospitals across the U.S. widely adopted information health technology company Epic's sepsis-prediction algorithm. Later evaluations found it substantially less accurate than marketed. Epic says that studies in clinical settings have found its sepsis model improved outcomes and that it has since released a second version it claims performs better. Still, nurses saw how an imperfect product could become policy—and then become their problem.

Burnout, staffing shortages and rising workplace violence are already thinning the nursing workforce, according to a 2024 nursing survey. Those pressures spilled onto the steps of New York City Hall last November, when members of the New York State Nurses Association rallied and then testified before the City Council's hospitals committee. They argued that some of the city's biggest private systems are pouring money into executives and AI projects while hospital units remain understaffed and nurses face escalating safety risks. As this story was going to press in mid-January, 15,000 nurses at hospital systems in New York City were on strike, demanding safer staffing levels and workplace protections.

New AI-enabled monitoring models often arrive in hospitals with the same kind of hype that has accompanied AI in other industries. In 2023 UC Davis Health rolled out BioButton in its oncology bone marrow transplant unit, calling it “transformational.” The device, a small, hexagonal silicone sensor worn on a patient's chest, continuously tracked vital signs such as heart rate, temperature and breathing patterns.

On the floor it frequently generated alerts that were difficult for nurses to interpret. For Melissa Beebe, a registered nurse who has worked at UC Davis Health for 17 years, the pings offered little actionable data. “This is where it became really problematic,” she says. “It was vague.” The notifications flagged changes in vital signs without specifics.

Beebe says she often followed alarms that led nowhere. “I have my own internal alerts—‘something's wrong with this patient, I want to keep an eye on them'—and then the BioButton would have its own thing going on. It was overdoing it but not really giving great information.”

As a union representative for the California Nurses Association at UC Davis Health, Beebe requested a formal discussion with hospital leadership before the devices were rolled out, as allowed by the union's contract. “It's just really hyped: ‘Oh, my gosh, this is going to be so transformative, and aren't you so lucky to be able to do it?'” she says. She felt that when she and other nurses raised questions, they were seen as resistant to technology. “I'm a WHY nurse. To understand something, I have to know why. Why am I doing it?”

Among the nurses' concerns were how the device would work on different body types and how quickly they were expected to respond to alerts. Beebe says leadership had few clear answers. Instead nurses were told the device could help with early detection of hemorrhagic strokes, which patients were particularly at risk for on her floor. “But the problem is that heart rate, temperature and respiratory rate, for a stroke, would be some pretty late signs of an issue,” she says. “You'd be kind of dying at that point.” Earlier signs of a hemorrhagic stroke may be difficulty rousing the patient, slurred speech or balance problems. “None of those things are BioButton parameters.”

In the end, UC Davis Health stopped using the BioButtons after piloting the technology for about a year, Beebe says. “What they were finding was that in the patients who were really sick and would benefit from that kind of alert, the nurses were catching it much faster,” she explains. (UC Davis Health said in a statement that it piloted BioButton alongside existing monitors and ultimately chose not to adopt it because its alerts did not offer a clear advantage over current monitoring.)

Beebe argues that clinical judgment, shaped by years of training and experience and informed by subtle sensory cues and signals from technical equipment, cannot be automated. “I can't tell you how many times I have that feeling, I don't feel right about this patient. It could be just the way their skin looks or feels to me.” Elven Mitchell, an intensive care nurse of 13 years now at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Modesto, Calif., echoes that view. “Sometimes you can see a patient and, just looking at them, [know they're] not doing well. It doesn't show in the labs, and it doesn't show on the monitor,” he says. “We have five senses, and computers only get input.”

Clinical care often relies on matching a patient's symptoms against rigid protocols—an environment ideal for automation.

Algorithms can augment clinical judgment, experts say, but they cannot replace it. “The models will never have access to all of the data that the provider has,” says Ziad Obermeyer, Blue Cross of California Distinguished Associate Professor of Health Policy and Management at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health. The models are mostly analyzing electronic medical records, but not everything is in the digital file. “And that turns out to be a bunch of really important stuff like, How are they answering questions? How are they walking? All these subtle things that physicians and nurses see and understand about patients.”

Mitchell, who also serves on his hospital's rapid-response team, says his colleagues have trouble trusting the alerts. He estimates that roughly half of the alerts generated by a centralized monitoring team are false positives, yet hospital policy requires bedside staff to evaluate each one, pulling nurses away from patients already flagged as high risk. (Kaiser Permanente said in a statement that its AI monitoring tools are meant to support clinicians, with decisions remaining with care teams, and that the systems are rigorously tested and continuously monitored.)

“Maybe in 50 years it will be more beneficial, but as it stands, it is a trying-to-make-it-work system,” Mitchell says. He wishes there were more regulation in the space because health-care decisions can, in extreme cases, be about life or death.

Across interviews for this article, nurses consistently emphasized that they are not opposed to technology in the hospital. Many said they welcome tools that are carefully validated and demonstrably improve care. What has made them wary, they argue, is the rapid rollout of heavily marketed AI models whose performance in real-world settings falls short of promises. Rolling out unvalidated tools can have lasting consequences. “You are creating mistrust in a generation of clinicians and providers,” warns one expert, who requested anonymity out of concern about professional repercussions.

Concerns extend beyond private vendors. Hospitals themselves are sometimes bypassing safeguards that once governed the introduction of new medical technologies, says Nancy Hagans, nurse and president of the New York State Nurses Association.

The risks are not merely theoretical. Obermeyer, the professor at Berkeley's School of Public Health, found that some algorithms used in patient care turned out to be racist. “They're being used to screen about 100 million to 150 million people every year for these kinds of decisions, so it's very widespread,” he says. “It does bring up the question of why we don't have a system for catching those things before they are deployed and start affecting all these important decisions,” he adds, comparing the introduction of AI tools in health care to medical drug development. Unlike with drugs, there is no single gatekeeper for AI; hospitals are often left to validate tools on their own.

At the bedside, opacity has consequences: If the alert is hard to explain, the aftermath still belongs to the clinician. If a device performs differently across patients—missing some, overflagging others—the clinician inherits that, too.

Hype surrounding AI has further complicated matters. Over the past couple of years AI-based listening tools that record doctor-patient interactions and generate a clinical note to document the visit spread quickly through health care. Many institutions bought them hoping they'd save clinicians time. Many providers appreciate being freed from taking notes while talking to patients, but emerging evidence suggests the efficiency gains may be modest. Studies have reported time savings ranging from negligible to up to 22 minutes per day. “Everybody rushed in saying these things are magical; they're gonna save us hours. Those savings did not materialize,” says Nigam Shah, a professor of medicine at Stanford University and chief data scientist for Stanford Health Care. “What's the return on investment of saving six minutes per day?”

Similar experiences have made some elite institutions wary of relying only on outside companies for algorithmic tools. A few years back Stanford Health Care, Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, and others brought AI development in-house so they could develop their own tools, test tools from vendors, tune them and defend them to clinicians. “It's a strategic redefinition of health-care AI as an institutional capability rather than a commodity technology we purchase,” Shah says. At Mount Sinai, that shift has meant focusing less on algorithms themselves and more on adoption and trust—trying to create trust with health-care workers and fitting new tools into the workflow.

AI tools also need to say why they're recommending something and identify the specific signals that triggered the alert, not just present a score. Hospitals need to pay attention to human-machine interactions, says Suchi Saria, John C. Malone Associate Professor of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University and director of the school's Machine Learning and Healthcare Lab. AI models, she argues, should function more like well-trained team members. “It's not gonna work if this new team member is disruptive. People aren't gonna use it,” Saria says. “If this new member is unintelligible, people aren't gonna use it.”

Yet many institutions do not consult or co-create with their nurses and other frontline staff when considering or building new AI tools that will be used in patient care. “Happens all the time,” says Stanford's Shah. He recalls initially staffing his data-science team with doctors, not nurses, until his institution's chief nursing officer pushed back. He now believes nurses' perspectives are indispensable. “Ask nurses first, doctors second, and if the doctor and nurse disagree, believe the nurse, because they know what's really happening,” he says.

To include more staff members in the process of developing AI tools, some institutions have implemented a bottom-up approach in addition to a top-down approach. “Many of the best ideas come from people closest to the work, so we created a process where anyone in the company can submit an idea,” says Robbie Freeman, a former bedside nurse and now chief digital transformation officer at Mount Sinai. A wound-care nurse had the great idea to build an AI tool to predict which patients are likely to develop bedsores. The program has a high adoption rate, Freeman says, partly because that nurse is enthusiastically training her peers.

Freeman says the goal is not to replace clinical judgment but to build tools clinicians will use—tools that can explain themselves. In the version nurses want, the alert is an invitation to look closer, not an untrustworthy digital manager.

The next frontier arrived at Mount Sinai's cardiac-catheterization lab last year with a new agentic AI system called Sofiya. Instead of nurses calling patients ahead of a stenting procedure to provide instructions and answer questions, Sofiya now gives them a ring. The AI agent, designed with a “soft-spoken, calming” voice and depicted as a female model in scrubs on life-size promotional cutouts, saved Mount Sinai more than 200 nursing hours in five months, according to Annapoorna Kini, director of the cath lab. But some nurses aren't onboard with Sofiya. Last November, at a New York City Council meeting, Denash Forbes, a nurse at Mount Sinai for 37 years, testified that Sofiya's work must still be checked by nurses to ensure accuracy.

Even Freeman admits there is a “ways to go” until this agentic AI will provide an integrated and seamless experience. Or maybe it will join the ranks of failed AI pilots. As the industry chases the efficiency of autonomous agents, we need an algorithm-testing infrastructure. For now the safety of the patient remains anchored in the very thing AI cannot replicate: the intuition of the human clinician. Like in the case of Adam Hart, who rejected a digital verdict in order to protect a patient's lungs, the ultimate value of the nurse in the age of AI may be not their ability to follow the prompt but their willingness to override it.

Young, successful AI researchers are increasingly choosing to leave academia for industry.Credit: Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty

In 2025, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta collectively spent US$380 billion on building artificial-intelligence tools. That number is expected to surge still higher this year, to $650 billion, to fund the building of physical infrastructure, such as data centres (see go.nature.com/3lzf79q). Moreover, these firms are spending lavishly on one particular segment: top technical talent.

Meta reportedly offered a single AI researcher, who had co-founded a start-up firm focused on training AI agents to use computers, a compensation package of $250 million over four years (see go.nature.com/4qznsq1). Technology firms are also spending billions on ‘reverse-acquihires' — poaching the star staff members of start-ups without acquiring the companies themselves. Eyeing these generous payouts, technical experts earning more modest-salaries might well reconsider their career choices (see ‘Academic brain drain').

Academia is already losing out. Since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, concerns have grown in academia about an ‘AI brain drain'. Studies point to a sharp rise in university machine-learning and AI researchers moving to industry roles. A 2025 paper reported that this was especially true for young, highly cited scholars: researchers who were about five years into their careers and whose work ranked among the most cited were 100 times more likely to move to industry the following year than were ten-year veterans whose work received an average number of citations, according to a model based on data from nearly seven million papers1.

Source: Ref. 1

This outflow threatens the distinct roles of academic research in the scientific enterprise: innovation driven by curiosity rather than profit, as well as providing independent critique and ethical scrutiny. The fixation of ‘big tech' firms on skimming the very top talent also risks eroding the idea of science as a collaborative endeavour, in which teams — not individuals — do the most consequential work.

Here, we explore the broader implications for science and suggest alternative visions of the future.

Astronomical salaries for AI talent buy into a legend as old as the software industry: the 10x engineer. This is someone who is supposedly capable of ten times the impact of their peers. Why hire and manage an entire group of scientists or software engineers when one genius — or an AI agent — can outperform them?

That proposition is increasingly attractive to tech firms that are betting that a large number of entry-level and even mid-level engineering jobs will be replaced by AI. It's no coincidence that Google's Gemini 3 Pro AI model was launched with boasts of ‘PhD-level reasoning', a marketing strategy that is appealing to executives seeking to replace people with AI.

But the lone-genius narrative is increasingly out of step with reality. Research backs up a fundamental truth: science is a team sport. A large-scale study of scientific publishing from 1900 to 2011 found that papers produced by larger collaborations consistently have greater impact than do those of smaller teams, even after accounting for self-citation2. Analyses of the most highly cited scientists show a similar pattern: their highest-impact works tend to be those papers with many authors3. A 2020 study of Nobel laureates reinforces this trend, revealing that — much like the wider scientific community — the average size of the teams that they publish with has steadily increased over time as scientific problems increase in scope and complexity4.

Why an overreliance on AI-driven modelling is bad for science

Why an overreliance on AI-driven modelling is bad for science

From the detection of gravitational waves, which are ripples in space-time caused by massive cosmic events, to CRISPR-based gene editing, a precise method for cutting and modifying DNA, to recent AI breakthroughs in protein-structure prediction, the most consequential advances in modern science have been collective achievements. Although these successes are often associated with prominent individuals — senior scientists, Nobel laureates, patent holders — the work itself was driven by teams ranging from dozens to thousands of people and was built on decades of open science: shared data, methods, software and accumulated insight.

Building strong institutions is a much more effective use of resources than is betting on any single individual. Examples demonstrating this include the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the global team that first detected gravitational waves; the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a leading genomics and biomedical-research centre behind many CRISPR advances; and even for-profit laboratories such as Google DeepMind in London, which drove advances in protein-structure prediction with its AlphaFold tool. If the aim of the tech giants and other AI firms that are spending lavishly on elite talent is to accelerate scientific progress, the current strategy is misguided.

By contrast, well-designed institutions amplify individual ability, sustain productivity beyond any one person's career and endure long after any single contributor is gone.

Equally important, effective institutions distribute power in beneficial ways. Rather than vesting decision-making authority in the hands of one person, they have mechanisms for sharing control. Allocation committees decide how resources are used, scientific advisory boards set collective research priorities, and peer review determines which ideas enter the scientific record.

And although attempting ‘innovation by committee' might sound disparaging, such an approach is crucial to make the scientific enterprise act in concert with the diverse needs of the broader public. This is especially true in science, which continues to suffer from pervasive inequalities across gender, race and socio-economic and cultural differences5.

This is why scientists, academics and policymakers should pay more attention to how AI research is organized and led, especially as the technology becomes essential across scientific disciplines. Used well, AI can support a more equitable scientific enterprise by empowering junior researchers who currently have access to few resources.

Instead, some of today's wealthiest scientific institutions might think that they can deploy the same strategies as the tech industry uses and compete for top talent on financial terms — perhaps by getting funding from the same billionaires who back big tech. Indeed, wage inequality has been steadily growing within academia for decades6. But this is not a path that science should follow.

Scientists at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and the RIKEN Center for Brain Science in Japan have identified two brain receptors that help regulate the breakdown of amyloid beta, the protein that builds up in Alzheimer's disease. Their findings suggest it may be possible to develop future medications that are both safer and more affordable than today's antibody based treatments.

Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia and is marked by sticky clumps of amyloid beta (Aβ) forming plaques in the brain. Normally, an enzyme called neprilysin helps clear away Aβ. However, neprilysin activity declines with aging and during the progression of the disease. The research team discovered that two somatostatin receptors, SST1 and SST4, work together to control neprilysin levels in the hippocampus, a region essential for memory. The findings were published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.

Boosting the Brain's Natural Defense System

The researchers conducted experiments using genetically modified mice and laboratory grown cells. When both SST1 and SST4 receptors were missing, neprilysin levels dropped. As a result, amyloid beta accumulated and the mice showed memory problems.

The team also tested a compound designed to activate these two receptors. In mice with Alzheimer's-like brain changes, stimulating SST1 and SST4 increased neprilysin levels, reduced amyloid beta buildup, and improved behavior. Importantly, the treatment did not cause serious side effects.

"Our findings show that the brain's own defence against amyloid beta can be strengthened by stimulating these receptors," says Per Nilsson, docent at the Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet.

Toward Safer and More Affordable Alzheimer's Drugs

Many of the most advanced Alzheimer's therapies currently rely on antibodies. While these treatments can target amyloid, they are extremely expensive and may trigger significant side effects in some patients.

"If we can instead develop small molecules that pass the blood-brain barrier, our hope is that we will be able to treat the disease at a significantly lower cost and without serious side effects," says Per Nilsson.

SST1 and SST4 belong to a large family of proteins known as G protein-coupled receptors. These receptors are common drug targets because they are well understood and often respond to medications that can be produced at lower cost and taken in pill form.

The project brought together researchers from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, RIKEN Center for Brain Science in Japan, and several other international universities. Funding was provided by organizations including the Swedish Research Council, the Hållsten Research Foundation, the Alzheimer's Foundation and the private initiative Innovative ways to fight Alzheimer´s disease -- Leif Lundblad Family and others and RIKEN. The researchers report no conflicts of interest.

Adolescents have long been stereotyped in literature and science as being impulsive and emotional. One aspect of their unique communication style has attracted attention in popular culture: ‘teensplaining'. Similar to mansplaining, when a man condescendingly explains things to a woman regardless of her expertise, it involves youths assuming they know more than adults do (often, parents and teachers) and teensplaining things in a disrespectful tone.

The spatial distribution of binders in Li-ion battery electrodes is critical to electrode performance, yet remains challenging to visualise, limiting binder optimisation efforts to chemical modifications rather than spatial control. Here, we show an accessible approach to staining carboxymethyl cellulose and styrene butadiene rubber binders in graphitic and Si-based Li-ion electrodes with silver and bromine, enabling detailed electron imaging and precise spectroscopic quantification of the binder domain. Leveraging these methods, we perform binder-informed optimisation of electrode manufacturing, achieving a 14% reduction in electronic resistivity, suppression of binder migration during high-temperature electrode drying, and a 40% decrease in electrode ionic resistance. Furthermore, staining enables electrode-scale, high-resolution backscattered electron imaging of complex binder hierarchies, revealing multiple types of agglomerates and elusive nanoscale binder films. These films completely coat graphitic surfaces in pristine electrodes but shatter into highly inhomogeneous fragments after calendering in both research-grade and commercial electrodes, presenting new perspectives on interpreting common cycling stability and electrode performance issues. We show how binder staining can advance fundamental understanding, quality control and manufacturing optimisation of Li-ion electrodes, particularly those based on widely used water-processable binders.

Polymeric binders are critical in providing mechanical stability to all Li-ion battery electrodes, but occupy less than 5% of the electrode volume1. It is well known that the spatial distribution of the binder within an electrode strongly influences the cohesion and adhesion of electrode coating, cycling stability2, electronic, ionic and thermal conductivity3,4,5,6 and, thus, the longevity, rate performance and cost of Li-ion batteries1,7. Particularly for Li-ion battery negative electrodes, however, mapping the small binder fractions remains highly challenging, impeding rational, binder-informed optimisation of electrode structure, performance and manufacturing. During electrode fabrication, for example, drying-induced binder migration can severely undermine subsequent electrode stability and rate performance8,9. To prevent this, industrial roll-to-roll manufacturing of Li-ion electrodes uses relatively slow drying in 30–100 m-long ovens that dominate the footprint of a coating line1,10,11 and require large capital investment (~105k euro/m of drying line, based on linear fitting of the published data10). As opposed to trial-and-error, efficient development of new drying approaches relies on accurate binder mapping techniques, as demonstrated in a number of studies8,9,12,13,14,15. Furthermore, among the many, often elaborate, techniques for decreasing tortuosity and increasing the power density of battery electrodes16,17,18,19, changing binder distribution at the electrode scale presents an attractive9, yet mostly unexplored alternative – because of the complex, hard-to-characterise nature of the binder domain. At a finer scale, the micro-distribution and coverage of binders on the active particle surfaces similarly remain challenging to determine6,20,21,22,23,24, leaving a significant gap in understanding the effects of binders on key surface processes, such as Li intercalation25 or formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)26,27,28,29.

Since the early 2000's, the water-soluble sodium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose (Na-CMC) blended with emulsified styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) has become the now-standard binder mixture used in industrial graphite and graphite/silicon negative electrodes30, and is also being explored for next-generation Si negative electrodes31 and water-processable LiFePO4 positive electrodes32,33. Being dispersible in water rather than toxic N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), these binders considerably lowered the cost and complexity of negative electrode manufacturing, and improved cycling stability of these electrodes1,34. Contrary to the previous-generation polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder, however, SBR and CMC lack distinct, covalently bound elements that are traceable by readily accessible methods such as energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) or backscattered electron imaging (BEI). Lacking a well-defined morphology, binders are also difficult to distinguish with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Thus, there are only a few convincing demonstrations of mapping SBR and CMC, using, for example, thermogravimetry15, Raman spectroscopy35 (both requiring unpractically thick or concentrated samples) or more sophisticated time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy36. Most recently, Lee et al. described staining of SBR with osmium tetroxide (OsO4) that could be detected by energy-selective backscattered electron imaging (EsB) or EDX spectroscopy to trace SBR migration in graphite electrodes during drying37,38. The extreme toxicity and volatility of OsO4, however, limit this approach to only the most specialised laboratories. Consequently, most of the works describing correlations between manufacturing conditions, electrochemical performance and binder distribution in graphite electrodes utilised EDX-traceable PVDF as a binder8,9,12,13,14, which has different mechanical properties, binding mechanism and can show exaggerated migration during drying compared with the commercially-used CMC/SBR binders15.

To circumvent these limits, here we describe two accessible binder staining methods that can be paired with EDX, BEI or EsB for rapid mapping and high-resolution imaging of aqueous binders in Li-ion battery electrodes. We demonstrate how these methods provide fundamental insights into binder organisation within the electrodes and enable binder-informed optimisation of Li-ion battery negative electrodes.

Our concept of binder staining relies on exposing electrode samples to chemical agents that attach to the functional groups present within the binders but not in the other electrode components, as shown schematically in Fig. 1. Immersing graphite electrodes in aqueous AgNO3 solution leads to Ag+ ions binding to the carboxyl groups in CMC, forming a water-insoluble complex depicted in Fig. 1a. On the other hand, exposing the electrodes to Br2 vapour brominates the aliphatic sp2 carbons of SBR, as depicted in Fig. 1b. The latter reaction is similar to OsO4 staining but with significantly lower hazard, as indicated by a 217-times higher short-term safe exposure limit for Br2 compared with OsO439. Thus, the reactions can be performed using simple equipment — a Schlenk line for bromination (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1), and a glass beaker and a vacuum desiccator for silverization (Fig. 1a). The mechanism of both reactions was confirmed using attenuated-total reflection infra-red spectroscopy (ATR-IR), X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and EDX, showing diminished aliphatic C=C peaks in brominated SBR, a strong shift of -COO- peaks in silverized CMC and a substitution of Ag for Na, as discussed in Supplementary Notes 1–2 and Supplementary Figs. 2–4. The high affinity of Ag+ for carboxylate groups is not limited to CMC — silverization was also successfully applied to carboxyl-rich sodium alginate and sodium polyacrylate — two other widely researched aquoeus binders with a superior performance in e.g. silicon negative electrodes31,34,40 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Note that because of the reactivity of Ag+(aq) and Br2, staining and binder mapping should be applied on separate electrode areas to those used in electrochemical or other testing.

To test the specificity of the staining reactions, we performed them on individual electrode components, i.e. dried films of CMC and SBR and powders of graphite and carbon conductive additive (C45). EDX and XPS were used to quantify Br and Ag concentration in the first 1 μm (EDX) and 10 nm (XPS) of the stained materials, showing a large amount of Ag in Ag-CMC and of Br in Br-SBR, and little to no binding of these elements to the other materials, as presented in Supplementary Fig. 3. Encouraged by these results, we used EDX to test the selectivity of staining on five electrode coatings containing graphite, 1 wt% C45 and 4% wt. (CMC + SBR) binder mixture with the relative CMC:SBR mass ratio ranging from 4:0 to 0:4. Each electrode coating was delaminated from the current collector, stained, and homogenised by pulverising in a mortar to remove any influence of binder migration on the quantification of staining efficiency. Figure 1c, d shows BEI of silverized and brominated electrode coatings with either only 4% CMC or 4% SBR, together with Ag and Br content quantified with EDX in all coatings in Fig. 1e. In the atomic number-sensitive BEI, the presence of Ag and Br strongly brightened contrast to the remaining materials containing mainly C, O and H. This allows clear identification of threads of Ag-CMC in the CMC-only electrode and patches of Br-SBR in the SBR-only electrode in Fig. 1c, d, respectively. Figure 1e shows that the amount of Ag in the silverized electrodes scaled linearly with the CMC content across all the CMC:SBR ratios. High selectivity of Ag to CMC over SBR was confirmed by the 16-times more Ag in the 4% CMC electrode compared to the minute Ag quantity in the 4 % SBR electrode. XPS analysis combined with detailed EDX mapping of non-homogenised electrodes presented in Supplementary Notes 2–3 and Supplementary Figs. 3–5 revealed that the small apparent reactivity of Ag to SBR was due to the reaction of Ag+ with leftover reagents used in the manufacturer's SBR emulsion-polymerisation, such as ionic surfactants, persulfates and thiols41,42, whose presence was indicated by Na, K and S found in the top of both SBR-only electrode and pure SBR sample. This analysis also showed that in non-homogenised electrodes, the negative impact of these reagents on the Ag-CMC staining selectivity may be larger in the top electrode region, where these compounds appeared to concentrate.

The amount of Br in the brominated samples also scaled linearly with the SBR content in the electrodes, with 7-times more Br in the 4% SBR electrode compared to the 4% CMC electrode (Fig. 1e). The small amount of Br binding to CMC was due to surface oxidation of Na-CMC by Br2 and binding of Br to Na (see exemplary Hunsdiecker reaction scheme in Fig. 1b)43. The associated formation of NaBr was suggested by the 1:1 elemental ratio of Br to Na detected by local EDX mapping inside the porous, high surface-area CMC/C45 agglomerates, as well as the mostly ionic (Br−) form of bromine detected with XPS in the top few nanometres of brominated CMC, as presented in Supplementary Notes 2,4 and Supplementary Figs. 3–4 and 6. The formation of NaBr on the CMC surface enabled BEI observation of CMC in brominated electrodes (Fig. 1d), similarly to Ag binding to CMC-COO− groups in silverized electrodes (Fig. 1c). The ionic binding of Br in brominated CMC was also stable under the SEM/EDX electron beam, contrary to the less stable Br bound to polymeric SBR, which progressively outgassed from the SBR-containing electrodes during continuous electron irradiation, as visible in time-resolved Br tracing in Fig. 1f. The extent of Br outgassing scaled linearly with SBR amount in the samples (Fig. 1g), suggesting it could be used to verify SBR quantification in brominated electrodes containing CMC — as we demonstrate below.

Having established the high specificity of the staining reactions, we tested their sensitivity to varying binder fraction within graphite electrodes, as presented in Fig. 2. This was verified using a model, ~300 μm-thick bi-layer electrode spray coated onto a Cu foil using a method reported in our previous work refs. 44,45,46. By consecutively spraying and instantly drying two slurries with relatively high and low binder concentration, we designed this electrode to have a 4-times difference in binder fraction between a lower, binder-rich layer (with 4.5% SBR and 3.0% CMC by weight) and an upper, binder-lean layer (with 1.13% SBR and 0.75% CMC), keeping the overall binder content within the typical range of Li-ion electrodes. After fabrication and calendering, electrode fragments were stained with either Br2 or Ag+, cross-sectioned using Ar plasma milling, and analysed using EDX and BEI. Note that before silverization, the Ag-treated electrodes were detached from the current collector to avoid reaction of Ag+ with the Cu foil current collector, as explained in “Methods”.

Each point and horizontal bar represents a single (n = 1) Δ from one scan or a pair of scans, respectively. The Δ's were calculated from mean signals in 110 μm (120 data points) of the binder-rich and lean layers. e Δ's derived using EDX, BEI and Br outgassing in all samples. For each staining type, n = 3 electrode samples were individually stained and measured with EDX and BEI. Weighted means (columns) were averaged from the individual measurements (points). The error bars correspond to Student's t-95% confidence intervals of derived Δ's (d) or averages of Δ's (e). All images were acquired at 10 kV and post-processed as described in “Methods”. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

The EDX maps of Ag-L and Br-L X-ray series presented in Fig. 2a show an expected bi-layer distribution of the staining elements, which is reflected in the derived through-thickness Ag and Br profiles in Fig. 2b. The profiles were individually ratioed and indicate 3.9 ± 1.8 (silverized) and 3.1 ± 0.4 (brominated) average element ratio Δ between the binder-rich and binder-lean layers, also summarised in Fig. 2e (note, ±corresponds to 95% confidence intervals). These average values are within 2.5% and 22% of the expected 4× ratio, with more undercounted Δ for the Br-stained SBR due to the larger susceptibility of SBR to drying-induced migration amplified by its weaker adsorption onto graphite47, as verified in Supplementary Note 5 and Supplementary Fig. 7. The element ratios in individual samples were also within 5–23% (silverized) and 4–6% (brominated) of the average values, indicating good precision in single 1 mm-wide cross-section measurements. The addition of a surfactant (1 mM Triton X-100) to the AgNO3 staining solution benefited wetting and accuracy of Ag-CMC profiling through the binder-lean region of the samples, as discussed in the wetting analysis in Supplementary Note 6 and Supplementary Fig. 8. The higher complexity of liquid-phase silverization and lower intrinsic Ag signal in Ag-CMC (as quantified in Fig. 1e) could also explain the larger spread of silverized Δ's compared to the brominated ones (Fig. 2e).

For the Br-SBR analysis, we verified its accuracy by following Br outgassing. This was done by subtracting Br-L traces derived from EDX maps acquired consecutively at increasing pixel dwell time (corresponding to the total mapping time and total electron dose). Fig. 2c shows that the differential (outgassed) Br-L profiles closely followed the absolute Br-L profiles, with a similar outgassing Δ of 3.5 ± 0.9× averaged across the three samples (Fig. 2e). Also, for the absolute EDX Ag-L and Br-L profiling, increasing mapping time did not significantly change the Δ values - accurate through-thickness binder profiling across these ~350 μm-thick electrodes could be performed as rapidly as 8 min for Br and 24 min for Ag (Fig. 2d). Although generation of higher quality EDX maps required at least 1 h (e.g. 3 h for the maps in Fig. 2a), the mapping time could be reduced to just a minute using BEI (Fig. 2a), due to much higher yield of backscattered electrons than electron-generated X-rays48. By analysing the distribution of white pixels in BEI images after multilevel Otsu thresholding49, they could also be used for quantitative binder profiling. Except for two silverized samples, the BEI-derived pixel profiles in Fig. 2b matched the EDX elemental profiles and gave similar Δ values. However, cross-sectional BEI remained more uncertain due to its sensitivity to image artefacts (e.g. particle surface charging) and trace metallic contamination after ion polishing, as shown in Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10.

Having established the staining methodology, we investigated detailed local binder organisation inside graphitic electrodes by combining staining with EsB. EsB is a low beam energy-variant of BEI that utilises a polarised filtering grid in front of an in-lens backscattered electron detector to capture backscattered electrons originating only from a shallow depth of the analysed surface, with high compositional resolution50,51,52. The method has been used previously for mapping the general distribution of PVDF and OsO4-stained SBR in graphite electrodes, but without focusing on local binder morphology37,52.

Figure 3 shows secondary electron and EsB images of the interior of an uncalendered standard graphite electrode (with 2.2 wt% SBR and 1.5 wt% CMC) after silverization. The images were acquired at low and high magnification (Fig. 3a, b, respectively) and gradually decreasing beam voltages, corresponding to decreasing electron-sample penetration depth and increasing surface sensitivity in consecutive images48. At 10 kV, the EsB images show bright, few micron-sized agglomerates of stained CMC and C45 conductive carbon nanoparticles, localised mostly between graphite particles (denoted as α phase in Fig. 3a, b). Containing a large number of C45 nanoparticles, these agglomerates influence long-range interparticle electronic conductivity within the electrode53 (also see the “Correlating slurry mixing, CBD agglomeration and the electrical resistivity of graphite electrodes” section below). The contrast from these agglomerates at 10 kV originated from a relatively bulky stained binder within their composite structure. Consequently, this contrast mostly disappeared at lower beam voltages of 2.5 and 2 kV (shown in Fig. 3a), where the depth probed by backscattered electrons was reduced from a few hundred to a few dozen nanometres (see the simulations in Fig. 3c). At these lower beam voltages, a second agglomerate type containing tightly packed, dark SBR nanoparticles mixed with CMC and C45 became visible (β morphology in Fig. 3a, b). The differentiation between C45, CMC and SBR was achieved by comparative analysis of electrodes prepared without SBR or C45, presented in Supplementary Fig. 11. Due to the large concentration of SBR in these agglomerates, they provide mechanical cohesion and elasticity to the electrode54,55,56. Finally, the EsB images acquired at even lower beam biases of 1.5 kV and 1 kV surprisingly revealed a third, continuous-layer morphology of binder (termed γ in Fig. 3a, b) that coated large regions of graphitic surfaces and was not visible at larger beam voltages. This binder layer was also not visible in control EsB images of a non-stained electrode or of a silverized CMC-free electrode, being only visible in the CMC-containing electrodes (Supplementary Fig. 12). These comparator experiments confirmed that bright EsB contrast at 1.5 and 1 kV in Fig. 3 unambigously corresponded to a continous thin film of silverized CMC that also embedded some non-stained (dark) SBR nanoparticles, visible in Fig. 3b. These observations were reproduced in several hundreds of EsB images acquired on four separately-made graphite electrodes after staining, some of them shown in Supplementary Fig. 13.

All the EsB images were acquired at an EsB filter grid voltage of −513 V. Therefore, the simulations in c only consider backscattered electrons with an exit energy larger than 513 eV. The electrodes contained 2.2 wt% SBR and 1.5 wt% CMC. Simulations were performed using the Casino package81. The description of electrode preparation and simulation procedure is provided in “Methods”. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Monte Carlo simulations were used to estimate the thickness of the CMC layer based on its changing visibility at different EsB imaging voltages, as described in “Methods”. Figure 3c shows the simulated depth of electron backscattering events in an Ag-CMC layer on a graphite particle at different electron beam energies. As an approximate detectability criterion, we assumed that the proportion of the electrons backscattered in the Ag-CMC layer to the electrons backscattered in the underlying graphite should be much larger than 0.5 at 1 keV and 1.5 keV for detection, and similar or lower than 0.5 at 2 keV and 2.5 keV for no detection. The plots of the cumulative distribution of backscattered electrons in Fig. 3c show that this condition was met for an Ag-CMC thickness of only 10-15 nm, which is in the same range as the thickness derived from high resolution SEM/EsB imaging of a fractured graphitic particle (Supplementary Fig. 14), as well as the assumed uniform binder layer thickness in graphitic electrodes calculated by Landesfeind et al.57. Because the CMC layer was so thin, it closely followed the morphology and contours of the underlaying graphite surfaces. This is why the layer could not be distinguished from bare graphite using conventional secondary electron microscopy (both in this and in previous works), even at very low beam voltages (Fig. 3b). Also note that in the ion-polished samples, the CMC layer was completely masked by trace metallic contaminants deposited on graphitic surfaces after the polishing (Supplementary Fig. 10). The thin layer could also be observed in EsB images of silverized electrodes with an analogous polyacrylate binder (Supplementary Fig. 15). Previous works have postulated that binders form nanoscale layers on active particle surfaces in Li-ion electrodes6,58,59,60,61, but the visual evidence for such binder morphology, until now, was limited to only a few higly localized spectroscopic transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies22,23,24.

The EsB images in Fig. 3a, b were acquired from an internal, delaminated region of an electrode where the bright CMC layer appeared as a patchy layer, allowing for differentiation from dark uncoated graphite surfaces. To assess if delamination might have affected the binder distribution, we also acquired images from the electrode top (not delaminated) surface (Fig. 4). The images of the silverized electrode in Fig. 4a show that the CMC layer completely coated graphite particle surfaces, with additional brighter patches of Ag bound to CMC or SBR emulsifiers that migrated to the surface during electrode drying. These EsB images also show additional dark areas that were not stained by Ag+ but produced charging in the secondary electron images (see the marked areas in Fig. 4a). As shown in Fig. 4b, on bromination, these areas appeared bright in the intially-acquired EsB images and rapidly faded in subsequent images. Recalling the electron-induced outgassing of Br from Br-SBR, this allowed indentifying these patches as SBR. Additionally, high magnification images show that they consisted of self-assembled individual SBR nanoparticles (the same, less agglomerated SBR particles were also visible in the CMC layer in Fig. 3b). That SBR retains nanoparticle form in the electrode results from the mild mixing conditions required during slurry preparation to prevent SBR demulsification62. The island-like agglomeration of SBR compared to the uniform layer appearance of CMC also evidences their different affinity to graphite surfaces47. Furthermore, Br outgassing from the “free” (not agglomerated with CMC) brominated SBR nanoparticles differentiates them from the superficially brominated CMC layer, whose EsB contrast remained unchanged during consecutive image acquisitions (see the images of an internal part of the brominated electrode in Supplementary Fig. 16). The outgassing of Br-SBR also allowed for quantification of SBR particle coverage by subtracting a later-acquired EsB image from the first EsB image (see Methods). We estimate that the ~120 nm thick SBR agglomerates covered 8–9% of the apparent graphite surface area on top and within this electrode, with an additional 6% of the internal electrode surfaces covered by the SBR/CMC agglomerates. The similarity of binder morphologies detected with EsB inside silverized (Fig. 3) and brominated (Supplementary Fig. 16) electrodes also suggested that the binder distribution itself was not affected by the staining procedures.

During the manufacturing of Li-ion electrodes, slurry coating and drying are followed by compressing (calendering) the electrodes between two metal rolls. Calendering reduces inter-particle porosity and often improves electrode electrical conductivity63, but its effect on binder distribution is largely unknown. Thus, we analysed binder surface coverage after hot calendering the electrode to 30% porosity at 80 °C. The EsB images from the top and interior of the calendered electrode in Fig. 4c show fracture and delamination of both the γ binder film and β SBR/CMC/C45 agglomerates. Fracture resulted in large, irregularly distributed areas of graphite particles where the previously near-complete CMC layer was shattered and partially delaminated. The remaining CMC patches covered only 32 ± 5% of the particle surface, based on gaussian filtering and grey-level thresholding of five EsB images (Fig. 4e). On the top electrode surface directly exposed to the hot calender rollers, CMC coverage was even lower (21 ± 3%, also visible in Fig. 4c). The shattering of the CMC layer was consistent with the reported brittleness of dried CMC64. These findings are not limited to laboratory-made electrodes—we also imaged uncycled commercial electrodes from LiFUN Technology (Xinma Industry Zone, Hunan Province, China). Figure 4d shows identical shattered CMC layers and SBR agglomerates in these electrodes, with over 60% of graphitic surfaces left bare and uncoated (Fig. 4e). Such high inhomogeneity in binder surface coverage can be expected to strongly affect surface processes on active material particles, such as Li+ (de)intercalation or formation of SEI, as explained in detail later.

To demonstrate how binder mapping can benefit the development of Li-ion electrodes, we carried out two practical studies. First, we investigated the relationship between the conditions of slurry processing, the distribution of conductive carbon/binder domain (CBD) within the electrodes, and electrode electrical resistivity (Fig. 5). In the graphite electrodes prepared using our standard slurry mixing protocol shown in Fig. 5a, large CBD clusters could be readily detected after bromination or silverization with BEI (Fig. 5b) and EsB at 10 kV (Fig. 4a). Although the spatial density of these clusters was moderate (8.5 cluster per mm2), they had a large geometric area of more than 100 μm2/cluster, shown in the associated histogram in Fig. 5c. This implied that a fraction of binder-embedded C45 conductive carbon particles was ineffectively and inhomogeneously distributed across the electrode. To reduce CBD agglomeration, we fabricated electrodes of the same dry mass composition, but using a more concentrated CMC solution (increased from 1.5 to 3 wt%) during an initial mixing step. After subsequent mixing with graphite, the slurry was diluted with water to the same final water fraction as in the standard slurry, as shown in Fig. 5a. We hypothesized that because the amphiphilic CMC electrostatically stabilizes solids dispersion in the slurry by adsorbing onto the graphite and carbon particle surfaces47, a more concentrated CMC solution in the first mixing step might increase CMC saturation on C45 surfaces, improving C45 dispersion in the slurry and in the final electrode. Figure 5b shows a BEI image of such a modified electrode after bromination, confirming the disappearance of large CBD clusters, which is also evident in the histogram in Fig. 5c. Interestingly, such a level of CBD de-agglomeration could not be achieved using zirconia balls during mixing of the standard 1.5 wt. % CMC slurry, indicating a stronger influence of the initial CMC concentration on the CBD dispersion (Supplementary Fig. 17). Recently, Park et al. similarly found that increasing the initial CMC concentration during mixing with carbon black particles improved their dispersion in wet slurries65. Furthermore, four-point probe measurements of not-stained samples showed that reduced CBD agglomeration decreased mean electronic resistivity in both uncalendared and calendered electrode coatings by 14 ± 2% (Fig. 5d), albeit with a somewhat larger uncertainty after calendering. While the absolute electronic resistivity of both electrode coatings was low ( ~ 0.1 Ω × cm) due to the omnipresence of electronically conductive graphite, these findings could help to optimise other electrodes based on more resistive active materials, e.g. LiFePO4 or sulfur, and similar binder/carbon additives. Future staining-assisted optimisation could investigate alternative pre-mixing methods of thinner, lower CMC-content slurries, or substituting C45 nanoparticles with carbon nanotubes or graphene for further resistivity decrease6.

BEI image segmentation and CBD clustering analysis were done as described in “Methods”. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

In the second application of binder staining, we explored phase inversion as a method to prevent binder migration during fast, high-temperature electrode drying (Fig. 6). Phase inversion is a roll-to-roll compatible process, where a polymer solution (e.g. PVDF in NMP) is immersed in a non-solvent (e.g. water) that destabilises the solution and causes rapid precipitation of the polymer, as schematically shown in Fig. 6a66. Several studies demonstrated that this process can improve manufacturability and cycling performance of >100 μm thick PVDF- and poly(ether sulfone)-based battery electrodes, partly due to induced directional porosity or altered PVDF morphology67,68,69. However, the effect of precipitating binders before electrode drying on final binder distribution has been difficult to assess. Therefore, we first screened 17 potential non-solvents and found that acetone and isopropanol rapidly precipitated CMC from aqueous solution, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 18. Then, we applied phase inversion to freshly-coated, wet graphite electrodes by dipping them for 3 min in isopropanol or acetone before drying at 120 °C and calendering at 80 °C, and compared them with a reference electrode processed identically but without phase inversion. Following staining of the binders, the EDX maps and binder profiles in Fig. 6b, c show that high-rate drying increased the CMC and SBR fraction at the top of the reference electrode. Blocking of the top surface pores with excessive binder obstructs the Li+ access to the electrode volume and leaves less binder at the interface with the current collector, lowering electrode adhesion9. Nonetheless, the migration was not as severe as in PVDF-based electrodes, in agreement with the recent results of Lee et al.37. Figure 6b shows that immersion in isopropanol further concentrated the binders at the top electrode surface by forming a dense polymer “skin layer”, likely associated with a relatively slow isopropanol permeation and delayed precipitation of the binder66,67. On the other hand, the electrode immersed in acetone showed a marked binder concentration near the current collector, possibly due to faster precipitation of CMC by acetone with 6× lower viscosity than isopropanol70. The greater binder fraction at the current collector allowed to extensively bend this relatively thick electrode without cracking, making it significantly more adherent to the current collector compared with the two other electrodes with the opposite binder distribution, as tested on not-stained samples (Fig. 6d). The EDX results were reproducible on separately made, processed and stained electrodes (Supplementary Fig. 19).

The average thickness (d) and porosity (ε) were identical for both types of electrodes and are indicated in f. The error bars and ±values correspond to 95% confidence intervals of the averages. Source raw and processed data are provided as a Source Data file.

To explore effects on pore ionic resistance, we tested unstained samples using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a non-intercalating electrolyte developed by Landesfeind et al. 3,57. Figure 6e shows the Nyquist plots of the reference and acetone-processed electrode in which the pore resistance was derived by extrapolating the low-frequency, near-linear regions of the plots4. Figure 6f shows that the measured ionic resistance was 40% lower for the acetone-processed electrode compared to the reference electrode, with the actual resistance difference possibly even larger71, as discussed in "Methods". The process did not change the comparatively low electronic contact resistance of the coatings, indicated by the absence of a high-frequency semicircle in the Nyquist plots3,72 (highlighted in Supplementary Fig. 20). Considering that all electrodes had identical composition, thickness and total porosity, the marked reduction in ionic resistance was a sole consequence of the preferential binder (and porosity) distribution, in agreement with simulations9,73. As demonstrated by Morasch et al. on a high-temperature-dried, mechanically delaminated and upturned electrode with a similar final binder distribution, reduced pore resistance leads to significant improvements in electrode fast charging and discharging performance9, and likely extends electrode lifetime74,75. Our results show that the same preferential binder distribution and reduced ionic resistance could be realised with a much more practical and potentially up-scalable phase inversion, which simultaneously enables rapid electrode drying. Combining phase inversion with using spherical (instead of flaky) graphite or pore patterning techniques could further improve ionic transport in such electrodes5,16,17,18,19.

Finally, we outline the present limitations of this study. First, the staining methods, particularly the liquid-phase silverization, are less applicable to electrodes containing easily-oxidizable materials (e.g. metallic, LiFePO4 or nano-Si particles), as these can rapidly undergo redox reactions with the staining elements, complicating image interpretation. Micro-Si or materials with an inert, stable surface passivation layer can be, however, suitable. This is shown in Fig. 7, which demonstrates successful staining on Si and C-coated SiOx microparticle-based electrodes but not on the more reactive LiFePO4 or nano-Si. For the same reason, silverization requires impractical detachment of any Cu current collector prior to staining, and the likely alteration of the electrode's electrochemistry by Ag+ and Br2 staining may restrict its applications, for example, in operando studies or online manufacturing quality control. Also, despite the time- and accessibility advantages of BEI, this imaging mode has a limited applicability for mapping Ag/Br-stained electrodes containing other high-Z elements (e.g. Si) where the use of EDX may be necessary (see BEI vs EDX in Fig. 7c). The same limit applies to EsB, where the contrast remains largely relative, highly sensitive to surface contamination, and requires calibration (as demonstrated herein)50. Furthermore, to minimise geometrical artefacts, the cross-sectional binder analysis requires lengthy sample plasma cross-sectioning (~8–12 h for 100 μm-thick electrodes), which might be shortened using laser pre-cutting or resin impregnation and microtomy. Also, because Ag+/Br2 staining targets carboxylate and aliphatic C=C groups in the binders, processes that alter these groups beforehand (e.g. drying-induced cross-linking) may reduce Ag/Br uptake (which, however, could be exploited to quantify binder cross-linking). Consequently, bromination and silverization are not suitable for staining e.g. PVDF or PTFE binders (that lack these functional groups), but can be suitable for other binders, such as the carboxyl-rich alginates and polyacrylates (as shown in Supplementary Fig. 15). However, the accuracy of spatial mapping of these two binders in electrodes remains to be fully quantified.

Due to the large S/V, the reactivity of nano-Si with Ag+ will impede staining selectivity towards CMC. c Top down secondary electron (SE), BEI, EDX and high magnification EsB images of internal surfaces of silverized micro-Si and C/SiOx electrodes containing 20 wt% graphite, 2.3% SBR, 1.5% CMC and 1% C45. The EDX maps show that Ag was bound and accurately found in CBD carbon-binder clusters (highlighted in the SE insets). The EsB images show good contrast of the CMC nanolayer on C/SiOx, but poor contrast on Si (see CMC on graphite particles as internal contrast standard). d EsB images of brominated micro-Si and C/SiOx electrodes with the same composition as in c, together with colourised differential Br outgassing maps of SBR processed using the code in Supplementary Note 7. e EsB images of silverized and brominated LiFePO4 electrodes with 1.5 wt% CMC and 2.3 wt% SBR. During silverization, Fe2+ reduced Ag+, forming large Ag dendrites. Bromination resulted in the formation of LiBr that deliquesced in air, forming liquid droplets visible in the inset photograph. Both reactions obscure the binders' detection in the LiFePO4-based electrodes. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

We have developed simple staining methods for mapping common aqueous binders — CMC and SBR — in graphitic Li-ion electrodes and showed how they enable better fundamental understanding and optimisation of these electrodes. On exposing electrodes to aqueous Ag+ or gaseous Br2, these elements bind to CMC and SBR, respectively, and act as markers for binder mapping using EDX (longer, but more accurate) and BEI (rapid, but less accurate), as verified on model bi-layered electrodes. Because Br binds to both SBR and (superficially) to CMC, bromination could be used for simultaneous BEI imaging of both of the binders, and the outgassing of Br from SBR in consecutively-acquired images allows for its distinction from CMC. The methods are compatible with micro-Si and SiOx-based electrodes, as well as analogous unsaturated and carboxylated binders, such as alginates and polyacrylates. We have shown that simple processing interventions and seemingly small differences in binder distribution can profoundly impact key metrics of the otherwise identical electrodes, improving their mechanical toughness or electronic and ionic conductivity. Staining combined with BEI, in particular, is simple and attractive for binder-informed optimisation and off-line quality control of electrodes in industrial settings, considering the availability of BEI even in table-top SEMs. The cost of implementing these methods comprises capital and operational costs of EDX/BEI-equipped SEM, while the staining itself utilises simple equipment and very small quantities of relatively cheap and reusable chemicals (here, 0.3 g AgNO3 or 0.6 g Br2 per batch of up to 5 samples). With optimisation of sample-cross sectioning, the complete staining, polishing and through-thickness EDX analysis time may be reduced from 15 to 5 h/sample and down to 3 h/sample for BEI analysis. Note that the staining and analysis, not requiring cross-sectioning, such as top-down CBD agglomeration check with BEI, can already be performed in less than 1 h/sample.

Combined with EsB, the staining methods enabled large-scale observation of surprisingly complex morphologies of CMC and SBR in laboratory-made and commercial graphitic Li-ion electrodes. The access to electrode-scale, high-resolution imaging of nanoparticulate SBR agglomerates and nano-thick CMC conformal films on graphitic particles opens new avenues for engineering active surfaces to enhance cyclability and stability of Li-ion battery negative electrodes. During galvanostatic Li intercalation, for example, we expect that the inhomogeneously-distributed surface patches of ionically resistive CMC76 and, in particular, thicker SBR can decrease electrochemically active surface area and cycling rate performance of graphite, also increasing local current density and local overpotential, which, in turn, could accelerate onset of localized Li metal plating and subsequent capacity drop (or failure) of the battery74. This could explain why excess SBR in graphitic electrodes correlates with increased internal cell resistance, lower SEI uniformity, accelerated Li plating and degrading cell capacity, as reported recently55. In this context, the effect of leftover SBR polymerisation agents, uncovered here, on the cyclability of the electrodes also remains an unexplored area. On the other hand, because carboxyl-rich binders (such as CMC) stabilise the SEI layer on graphite surfaces22,24,27, devising ways to maximise CMC coverage may also benefit cycling stability of graphitic and, in particular, volume-changing silicon electrodes2,31,64. The demonstrated effect of calendering on reducing CMC surface film coverage from ~90% in pristine graphite electrodes to 21% on top- and 32% within calendered electrodes also prompts reassessing how calendering conditions affect electrochemical stability and performance of graphite-based electrodes. Considering the SEI-stabilising role of CMC, for example, the lower CMC coverage at the top electrode surface after calendering can contribute to the increased SEI growth and blocking of pores in this electrode region74, and can partially explain why Li plating starts at the top of graphite-based electrodes, even at mild cycling conditions27,74,75. Therefore, the rich information provided by binder staining can shed new light on fundamental electrode processes and extend optimisation routes of Li-ion battery negative electrodes.

The uncertainty (±) of values reported in this work corresponds to their expanded 95% confidence intervals estimated with the Taylor Series Method or the Monte Carlo method, considering both random and systematic uncertainties of the values.

Artificial graphite (BTR S360-E3, flakes, nominal D50 = 16 μm), sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (degree of substitution = 0.8–0.95, Ashland), SBR (40% wt. suspension in water), carbon conductive additive (C-NERGYTM SUPER C45, Imersys), bromine liquid (99.8%, Alfa Aesar), silver nitrate (99.9999% trace metal basis, Sigma Aldrich), silicon powders (325 mesh: 99% trace metal basis, Sigma Aldrich and <50 nm: 98%, Alfa Aesar), C/SiOx powder (High Capacity Silicon Based Anode Powder, MSE Supplies), ethylene carbonate (≥ 99%, acid < 10 ppm, H2O < 10 ppm, Sigma Aldrich) and dimethyl carbonate (anhydrous, ≥99%, Sigma Aldrich) were used as received. The as-received tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (for EC analysis, ≥99.0%, Merck-Supelco) was dried in a vacuum over silica gel at room temperature for 3 days prior to bringing it into an Ar-filled glovebox to prepare the non-intercalating electrolyte for the EIS analysis. The water used for the preparation of aqueous solutions and electrode slurries was type II deionised water (0.5 μS/cm, TOC < 50 ppb). The battery-grade SBR was of a popular brand with known application in industrial Li-ion battery manufacturing, whose name is not disclosed for confidentiality.

Typical graphite electrodes were prepared from liquid slurries mixed using an Interionics Thinky ARE-250 planetary mixer in 35 mL polypropylene pots. First, 6 g of 1.5% wt. aqueous Na-CMC was mixed with 60 mg of C45 powder at 500 rpm for 1 min and 2000 rpm for 10 min. Then, 5.71 g of graphite powder was added and mixed at 500 rpm for 1 min and 2000 rpm for 10 min, followed by degassing at 2200 rpm for 3 min. Note that in the CBD agglomeration study (in “Correlating slurry mixing, CBD agglomeration and the electrical resistivity of graphite electrodes”), the graphite mixing was divided into two 5 min intervals with an additional 1 min 500 rpm mixing step in between, for full comparability with the modified procedure described in the same section. Finally, 0.33 g of 40% wt. aqueous SBR suspension was added and mixed at 500 rpm for 5 min. The as-obtained slurry with a total solid mass content of 49.3% was then blade-casted onto 10 μm-thick, isopropanol-wiped and dried Cu foil, using a digital adjustable applicator (QC Laboratory Equipment Ltd.), and dried in a fan convection oven for 30 min at 50 °C. The typical electrodes had a dry mass composition of 95.21 ± 0.06 wt% graphite, 2.22 ± 0.02 wt% SBR, 1.51 ± 0.01 wt% CMC and 1.05 ± 0.06 wt% C45, based on the weight of the materials used in 10 separately-made slurries. The electrodes were then cut into 20 mm-wide rectangular stripes and calendered using Sumet CA3 hot calender (150 mm drums width) operating at 80 °C, 0.2 m/min pass speed and 35 N/mm set force (corresponding to 263 N/mm of force normalised to the sample width), to produce 30% porous electrodes (standard deviation = 1%, n = 28).

The electrodes were brominated after vacuum-drying by exposing them to vapours of Br2 in an air-free setup depicted in Supplementary Fig. 1. The reaction was carried out inside a small glass reactor at 50 oC and Br2 pressure of 5–8 × 10−2 mbar for 270 s, followed by outgassing of excess Br2 under active vacuum (~2 × 10−2 mbar). The temperature and time were chosen to ensure no condensation of Br2 vapours inside the reactor and to facilitate complete reaction with SBR while minimising the processing time. Br2 vapours were provided by the small Br2 pool placed in a separate glass vial immersed in a small water bath (~20 °C) and connected to the pre-evacuated and heated reactor (~2 × 10−2 mbar, 50 °C) under static vacuum. The bromination conditions were applied without any further optimisation. After bromination, the initial samples were kept in a N2-sealed vessel until EDX/BEI analysis to avoid humidity-induced hydrolysis of brominated SBR; however, our later EDX tests also indicated no significant loss of Br from the electrodes in air for at least two weeks prior to the EDX/BEI analysis.

The electrodes were silverized by immersing them in a crystallizer containing 0.5 M AgNO3 for 3 min (depicted in Fig. 1a). For the CMC analysis of homogenized and bi-layered electrodes (in “Mechanism and specificity of staining reactions and Staining bi-layered electrodes”, respectively), the 0.5 M AgNO3 solution was freshly mixed with 1 mM Triton X-100 non-ionic surfactant prior to staining to help with penetration of the solution into all of the electrode, as discussed in detail in Supplementary Note 6 and Supplementary Fig. 8. During all silverizations, the crystallizer with AgNO3-soaked electrodes was briefly placed in a desiccator under mild vacuum to facilitate penetration of AgNO3 solution within the electrodes. After that time, the electrodes were taken out of the solution, washed with copious water and dried. Following silverization of the initial samples, there were visual signs of corrosion of the Cu foil and micron-sized Ag particles in random areas in the SEM images of the samples. This points to galvanic replacement of Ag+(aq) with Cu, according to Eq. (1):

To prevent it, prior to staining further electrodes, they were first carefully delaminated and transferred from the Cu foil support onto adhesive carbon SEM discs supported on a polypropylene film that was inert to Ag staining.

Secondary electron microscopy, BEI and EDX spectroscopy were performed using Zeiss Merlin field-emission SEM paired with Oxford Instruments (OI) XMax 150 mm2 and windowless XMax 80 mm2 EDX detectors operating in double detector mode, as well as Hitachi TM3030 table-top SEM paired with OI 30 mm2 EDX detector equipped with SATW polymer window (used for BEI in “Correlating slurry mixing, CBD agglomeration and the electrical resistivity of graphite electrodes” and for the EDX analysis of stained individual electrode components, presented in Supplementary Information). Typical EDX acquisitions were performed at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV and a spectral resolution of 5 eV/channel using TruMap mode, following energy-calibration against a 99.9% pure Cu standard. Elemental quantification was performed using factory standards provided in the OI Aztec software version 6.1. Systematic uncertainty of the EDX quantification was verified using freshly cleaned Ag wire and dried C-coated KBr pellet with 99.9% and ≥99% trace metal-basis purity, respectively, giving 1.3 ± 1.0% and 3.2 ± 1.5% relative bias for Ag and Br quantification, respectively. Considering ~4% uncertainty due to the roughness/porosity of the graphitic samples48, we estimate the relative combined systematic uncertainty of Ag and Br quantification at the applied conditions and 95% confidence level as ±8.4% and ±10.4%, respectively. All EsB images were acquired at a filtering grid voltage of −513  V.

Attenuated total reflection infra-red spectroscopy (ATR-IR) was performed using a Varian Excalibur FTS 3500 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a DTGS detector and Specac Golden Gate ATR accessory (monolithic diamond window, single bounce, 45° incidence angle, KRS-5 lenses) operating in air. For each sample, the background-corrected spectra were averaged from 256 scans acquired at 2.5 kHz speed and 4 cm−1 resolution.

XPS was performed using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer using a monochromatized Al K-alpha X-ray beam with an energy of 1486.7 eV and a voltage of 12 kV. For survey scans, a pass energy of 200 eV and a step size of 1 eV were used. For narrow scans, a pass energy of 50 eV and a step size of 0.1 eV were used. The binding energy of the spectra was corrected using the fitted saturated C-H peak at 285.0 eV. Spectra processing was done using CasaXPS 2.3.2777.

Electrical resistivity of electrode coatings was measured using an Ossila four-point probe system equipped with spring-loaded soft contact cylindrical golden probes with 0.48 mm diameter and 1.27 mm spacing. Because the technique requires samples to be supported by non-conductive substrates, to measure uncalendared coatings, they were slurry-casted on polypropylene sheets and cut into 30×30 mm samples after drying. To measure calendered coatings, coatings were first fabricated on Cu foils and calendered to 228 μm thickness and 32% porosity at 80 °C, delaminated from Cu foils, cut to 25 × 25 mm squares and measured on top of a glass substrate. Each sample was measured 10 times, rotating it by 90° between the measurements, and the results were averaged and normalised to sample thickness (the measurements are summarised in Supplementary Table 1).

To determine the pore ionic resistivity, the electrodes were first cut into 16 mm-diameter discs and dried under active vacuum at 120 °C overnight. After drying, the electrodes were brought to an Ar-filled glovebox (H2O and O2 level below 10 ppm) without breaking the vacuum and assembled in symmetric 2-electrode cells using EL-CELL PAT-Cell test cells equipped with a 260 μm-thick, 91% porous Whatman GF/A glass fibre separator. The electrolyte was 100–140 μL of 10 mM tetrabutylammonium perchlorate in 1:1 wt. ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate. Care was taken to maximise the alignment of the top electrode directly above the bottom electrode by using a vacuum pen. EIS was performed using a Biologic SP-150 potentiostat in an air-conditioned room maintained at 21 ± 1 °C. The measurements were done at the DC potential equalling the open circuit potential of each cell, in the 100 kHz–10 mHz frequency range, using an AC potential amplitude of 15 mV, averaging five measures per frequency and performing three full frequency scans for each cell (with a resting period of 2 h in between the measurements). Before the first measurement, the cells were allowed to equilibrate at the open circuit potential for 8 h. The electrodes had an average loading of 14 ± 1 mg/cm2 and 30 ± 3% porosity. Note that most recently, Bieneck et al. showed that the pore ionic resistance determined with symmetric-cell EIS can be strongly influenced by the spatial distribution of the double layer capacitance (Cdl) of carbon black, and its contribution to the overall Cdl of the electrode71. Based on the mass composition of our electrodes and the BET surface area of the graphite and C45 carbon black (1.47 and 45 m2/g, respectively), the estimated contribution of C45 to the total Cdl of the electrodes was ~25%. The analysis of Figure 9 in Bieneck's paper shows that for such Cdl contribution, the pore ionic resistance of the reference electrode (with CBD concentrated close to the separator) determined with EIS may be underestimated by ~12% and that of the acetone-processed electrode (with CBD concentrated close to the current collector) may be overestimated by ~23%, implying that the actual pore ionic resistance difference between these electrodes may be ~57% instead of the apparent 40%.

All the EDX maps and derived elemental profiles were acquired and processed using Oxford Instruments Aztec 6.1 SP2 software, using signal filtering at 99% or 95% confidence threshold. The combined EDX maps in Figs. 2 and 6 were prepared by binning Ag-L and Br-L elemental maps with a factor of 2, followed by clipping 5% of the high intensity pixels and stacking with C and Cu maps using weighting settings of 1.0 (Ag or Br) and 0.4 (C and Cu) for an optimum visibility of the staining elements against the sample matrix. Note that the maps of silverized samples did not include Cu, as these samples were detached from the Cu foil prior to staining and analysis. All the EDX Br-L and Ag-L line profiles were checked for EDX geometrical artefacts by following the reference C-K signals, which should not show a significant gradient through the thickness of electrode coatings. In one sample (silverized reference electrode in the phase inversion study), a 35% positive linear gradient was present in the C-K signal from the bottom to the top of the coating. Hence, the Ag-L signal was corrected by subtracting this gradient using Eq. (2):

where y and ycorr is the raw and corrected Ag-L signal, respectively, x is the distance (in μm), a is the linear regression slope (gradient) of the C-K signal vs x, fitted between x0 = 50 μm and \({x}_{{{{\rm{end}}}}}\) = 137 μm (the part of the EDX scan corresponding to the electrode coating), and S is the scaling factor (the ratio of the integrated Ag-L to integrated C-K signals). The raw and corrected Ag-L and reference C-K signals are provided in the Source Data file.

To derive the vertical distribution of binders from BEI images, the images were segmented using the Multi Otsu Threshold plugin78 in the Fiji 2.14.079 package. Most of the images were segmented using three levels corresponding to the bright stained binder phase, grey graphite phase and black interparticle pore phase. In a few images with visible strong charging artefacts at the graphite particle edges, the number of levels was set to 4 to account for these artefacts, giving a smaller error in the binder phase detection.

To quantify CBD agglomerate size distribution from the BEI images in the “Correlating slurry mixing, CBD agglomeration and the electrical resistivity of graphite electrodes”, the images were first processed using Smart Blur (setting 50) in CorelDRAW 2021. Then, they were thresholded in Fiji using Sauvola local threshold (radius = 100, parameter 1 = 0.2, parameter 2 = 7) followed by the particle size analysis using Fiji's default “Analyze Particles” function, considering agglomerates with at least 1 μm2 surface area.

For quantification of CMC surface coverage from EsB images of silverized electrodes, for the images with high EsB noise, they were first de-noised using the default Fiji smooth filter. This was followed by selectively removing dark interparticle pores from the analysis area using Phansalkar's local threshold algorithm (radius 100, parameter 1 = 0.7, parameter 2 = 0). This was followed by applying several local and general threshold algorithms (e.g. Bernsen, Niblack, Moments, Huang) on copies of the image and averaging the results. For quantification of SBR coverage from EsB images of brominated electrodes, two EsB images acquired at the first and 3rd–5th scan (before and after Br outgassing, respectively) were first registered using the affine SIFT algorithm80, cropped on edges, and denoised using median and non-local means filter (sigma = 5, smoothing factor = 1). The Yen threshold was applied on the nth EsB image to quantify SBR/CMC agglomerates, which were subsequently removed from the region of interest in the 1st EsB image. Phansalkar's local threshold was used to remove dark interparticle pores, followed by subtracting the nth image from the 1st image and applying Otsu or Yen threshold to quantify the surface SBR agglomerate areas. The macro used for quantification is presented in Supplementary Note 7.

Monte Carlo simulations were performed using Casino 3.3.0.4 software81 for a layer of Ag-CMC on a graphite substrate, using ELSEPA scattering cross-sections82 and a modified Bethe equation by Joy and Luo for calculating stopping power83. The simulations were performed using 106 electrons formed into a beam of 5 nm diameter and a Gaussian profile (1.65 nm2 variance), at primary electron energies of 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 10 keV and a lower energy cutoff of 513 eV to reflect the EsB filter grid voltage of -513 V used in the experiments. The thickness of the Ag-CMC layer was varied between 1 and 20 nm, and the thickness of the graphite substrate was set at 1 μm (for 1–2.5 keV simulations) or 10 μm (for the 10 keV simulation). The stoichiometry of Ag-CMC used in the simulation was Ag802C7617O6615H10824, which corresponds to a Na-CMC chain with 102 glucopyranose units and a degree of substitution of 0.82, where all the Na bound to carboxylate groups was substituted with Ag (this stoichiometry was also found to have a similar atomic composition as the one determined with EDX on silverized CMC). The Ag-CMC density was set at 1.96 g/cm3, based on the average reported true density of Na-CMC of 1.5 g/cm3 and assuming the same molar volume of Ag-CMC as Na-CMC. The cumulative distributions of maximum penetration depth of backscattered electrons were calculated based on all the simulated electrons, while 104 electrons were considered for plotting backscattered electron trajectories. These trajectories were extracted from the simulation data files into.csv files using a Python code generated with OpenAI ChatGPT-484 and verified by the first author for accuracy. The code is provided in Supplementary Note 8.

This work used OpenAI ChatGPT-484 to assist in creating a Python code to extract electron trajectories from the Monte Carlo simulation output files generated by the Casino 3.3 Monte Carlo package81. The code was verified by the first author for accuracy and is provided as Supplementary Note 8.

A parasite that may already be living in your brain has the ability to infect the very immune cells designed to eliminate it. New research from UVA Health explains how the body still manages to keep this infection under control.

Toxoplasma gondii is a potentially dangerous parasite that infects warm blooded animals. People are most often exposed through contact with cats, contaminated fruits or vegetables, or undercooked meat. After entering the body, the parasite can spread to multiple organs and eventually settle in the brain, where it can remain for life. Roughly one third of the global population is believed to carry Toxoplasma, yet most people never develop symptoms. When illness does occur, known as toxoplasmosis, it is most serious in individuals with weakened immune systems.

Researchers led by Tajie Harris, PhD, set out to understand how the immune system responds when Toxoplasma invades CD8+ T cells, which are specialized immune cells responsible for killing infected cells.

"We know that T cells are really important for combatting Toxoplasma gondii, and we thought we knew all the reasons why. T cells can destroy infected cells or cue other cells to destroy the parasite. We found that these very T cells can get infected, and, if they do, they can opt to die. Toxoplasma parasites need to live inside cells, so the host cell dying is game over for the parasite," said Harris, the director of the Center for Brain Immunology and Glia (BIG Center) at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. "Understanding how the immune system fights Toxoplasma is important for several reasons. People with compromised immune systems are vulnerable to this infection, and now we have a better understanding of why and how we can help patients fight this infection."

Caspase-8 and the Self-Destruct Defense

Harris and her team discovered that CD8+ T cells rely on a powerful enzyme called caspase-8 to control T. gondii. Caspase-8 plays a central role in regulating immune responses and can trigger a process that causes a cell to self-destruct.

In laboratory experiments, mice that lacked caspase-8 in their T cells developed far higher levels of T. gondii in their brains compared to mice whose T cells produced the enzyme. This happened even though both groups mounted strong immune responses against the infection.

The difference in outcomes was striking. Mice with caspase-8 remained healthy, while those without it became severely ill and died. Examination of their brain tissue showed that their CD8+ T cells were much more likely to be infected by the parasite.

These findings indicate that caspase-8 plays a crucial role in limiting T. gondii inside T cells. The results also add to growing evidence that this enzyme is broadly important in helping the body control infectious threats.

"We scoured the scientific literature to find examples of pathogens infecting T cells. We found very few examples," said Harris, part of UVA's Department of Neuroscience. "Now, we think we know why. Caspase-8 leads to T cell death. The only pathogens that can live in CD8+ T cells have developed ways to mess with Caspase-8 function. Prior to our study, we had no idea that Caspase-8 was so important for protecting the brain from Toxoplasma."

Study Details and Funding

The findings were published in the journal Science Advances. The research team included Lydia A. Sibley, Maureen N. Cowan, Abigail G. Kelly, NaaDedee A. Amadi, Isaac W. Babcock, Sydney A. Labuzan, Michael A. Kovacs, Samantha J. Batista, John R. Lukens and Harris. The scientists reported no financial conflicts of interest.

Funding for the research came from the National Institutes of Health, grants R01NS112516, R01NS134747, R21NS12855, T32GM008715, T32AI007496, T32AI007046, T32NS115657, F30AI154740, T32AI007496 and T32GM007267; a University of Virginia Pinn Scholars Award; a UVA Shannon Fellowship; and UVA's Strategic Investment Fund.

Scientists have designed a powerful light based sensor capable of detecting extremely small amounts of cancer biomarkers in blood. The innovation could eventually allow doctors to identify early warning signs of cancer and other diseases through a routine blood draw.

Biomarkers such as proteins, fragments of DNA, and other molecules can signal whether cancer is present, how it is progressing, or a person's risk of developing it. The difficulty is that in the earliest stages of disease, these markers exist in extremely low concentrations, making them hard to measure with conventional tools.

"Our sensor combines nanostructures made of DNA with quantum dots and CRISPR gene editing technology to detect faint biomarker signals using a light-based approach known as second harmonic generation (SHG)," said research team leader Han Zhang from Shenzhen University in China. "If successful, this approach could help make disease treatments simpler, potentially improve survival rates and lower overall healthcare costs."

In Optica, Optica Publishing Group's journal for high-impact research, Zhang and his team reported that the device detected lung cancer biomarkers in patient samples at sub-attomolar levels. Even when only a few molecules were present, the system produced a clear and measurable signal. Because the platform is programmable, it could potentially be adapted to identify viruses, bacteria, environmental toxins, or biomarkers linked to conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.

"For early diagnosis, this method holds promise for enabling simple blood screenings for lung cancer before a tumor might be visible on a CT scan," said Zhang. "It could also help advance personalized treatment options by allowing doctors to monitor a patient's biomarker levels daily or weekly to assess drug efficacy, rather than waiting months for imaging results."

Amplification Free Optical Sensing Technology

Most current biomarker tests require chemical amplification to increase tiny molecular signals, which adds time, complexity, and expense. The researchers aimed to create a direct detection strategy that eliminates those additional steps.

The system relies on SHG, a nonlinear optical phenomenon in which incoming light is converted into light with half the wavelength. In this design, SHG takes place on the surface of a two dimensional semiconductor called molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂).

To precisely position the sensing components, the team built DNA tetrahedrons, which are small pyramid shaped nanostructures formed entirely from DNA. These structures hold quantum dots at carefully controlled distances from the MoS₂ surface. The quantum dots intensify the local optical field and boost the SHG signal.

CRISPR-Cas gene editing technology was then incorporated to recognize specific biomarkers. When the Cas12a protein detects its target, it cuts the DNA strands that anchor the quantum dots. This action triggers a measurable drop in the SHG signal. Because SHG produces very little background noise, the system can detect extremely low biomarker concentrations with high sensitivity.

"Instead of viewing DNA only as a biological substance, we use it as programmable building blocks, allowing us to assemble the components of our sensor with nanometer-level precision," said Zhang. "By combining optical nonlinear sensing, which effectively minimizes background noise, with an amplification-free design, our method offers a distinct balance of speed and precision."

Successful Lung Cancer Testing in Human Serum

To evaluate real world performance, the researchers focused on miR-21, a microRNA biomarker associated with lung cancer. After confirming that the device could detect miR-21 in a controlled buffer solution, they tested it using human serum from lung cancer patients to simulate an actual blood test.

"The sensor worked exceptionally well, showing that integrating optics, nanomaterials and biology can be an effective strategy to optimize a device," said Zhang. "The sensor was also highly specific -- ignoring other similar RNA strands and detecting only the lung cancer target."

The next goal is to shrink the optical system. The researchers aim to develop a portable version that could be used at the bedside, in outpatient clinics, or in remote areas with limited medical resources.

CBS forced The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to cancel an appearance by a Democrat up for election later this year, according to the host. The decision stems from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's repeated threats to punish network television stations that he believes are airing unbalanced political content.

“Texas State Rep. James Talarico, he was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,” host Stephen Colbert said on air on Monday night. “Then I was told in some uncertain terms that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on, and because my network clearly doesn't want us to talk about this, let's talk about this.”

The reason stems from a long-time Federal Communications Commission rule called the “Equal Time Rule,” which states that all candidates in an election should be offered equal airtime for their messaging on radio and broadcast channels.

Talarico is running against fellow Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett in the Texas Democratic primary slated for March 3. Both primary candidates are rising stars in the Democratic Party, and whoever wins will be in the race to flip the state's reliably Republican Senate seat currently held by Sen. John Cornyn.

The “Equal Time Rule” does not apply to streaming, nor does it apply to news interviews or talk show interviews with politicians.

Last month, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr signaled his intention to drop the exception for daytime and late-night TV talk shows, claiming that the programs are “motivated by partisan purposes.” In response to the news, Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez told Politico that “the FCC is now a political arm of this administration.”

Colbert said that Carr's letter was announcing the intention to drop the exception, but it wasn't a real policy change yet.

“He hasn't done away with it yet, but my network is unilaterally enforcing it as if he had,” Colbert said. “But I want to assure you, ladies and gentlemen, please, I want to assure you, this decision is for purely financial reasons.”

As a result of the network's pressure, Colbert has instead posted his interview with Tallarico on the Late Show's YouTube channel, though CBS even barred him from giving out a URL or a QR code for it on air.

Colbert also pointed out that this isn't the FCC's first attack on talk shows or Rep. Tallarico. Earlier this month, the FCC reportedly opened an investigation into ABC's “The View” talk show, promptly following an interview with Rep. Tallarico.

Republicans might have some reason to be afraid of Tallarico's chances to flip the Senate seat. Back in 2018, he flipped a reliably Republican seat in a county that was once referred to as a “conservative bastion.”

“I think that Donald Trump is worried that we're about to flip Texas,” Tallarico said in the Colbert interview posted on YouTube. “This is the party that ran against cancel culture, and now they're trying to control what we watch, what we say, what we read, and this is the most dangerous kind of cancel culture, the kind that comes from the top.”

Temporal has raised $300 million in a Series D funding round at a $5 billion valuation, positioning the company as a key infrastructure provider for the emerging wave of AI agents moving into real-world production.

The latest round, led by Andreessen Horowitz, doubles the company's valuation from October.

Temporal builds open-source software and a cloud service that helps companies run long-running, complex workflows reliably — what it calls “durable execution.” The Bellevue, Wash.-based company says that as AI systems become more autonomous and take actions across multiple services, reliability has become a challenge. 

“Agentic AI doesn't fail because the models aren't good enough,” Samar Abbas, CEO and co-founder of Temporal, said in a press release. “It fails because the systems around them can't handle real-world execution.”

Temporal says revenue grew more than 380% year-over-year, weekly active usage increased 350%, and installations rose 500%. Its cloud platform has processed 9.1 trillion lifetime action executions, including 1.86 trillion for AI-native companies.

OpenAI uses Temporal to help power certain production workflows. Other customers include ADP, Yum! Brands, and Block. Andreessen Horowitz described Temporal as becoming a foundational execution layer for the AI era.

“For long-running agents operating over extended horizons, the durability that Temporal provides is the difference between a compelling demo and a production system,” the Silicon Valley firm wrote in a blog post. “The underlying execution layer has become a central piece of the emerging AI agent stack.”

Temporal originally focused on helping developers manage complex, distributed workflows. But the rise of AI agents has amplified the need for infrastructure that can safely execute long-running, stateful systems over extended periods. Temporal's platform preserves application state, automatically retries failed steps, and allows workflows to resume exactly where they left off instead of starting over.

Temporal co-founders Samar Abbas and Maxim Fateev previously worked together at Uber and helped build an internal open-source orchestration engine called Cadence. The experience helped inspire them to launch Temporal in 2019. Fateev previously worked at Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. Abbas also worked at Microsoft and Amazon.

Abbas took over CEO duties from Fateev in 2024. Fateev is now CTO.

Temporal has raised $650 million to date. It closed a $105 million secondary transaction in October, and raised $146 million Series C round earlier in 2025. The company employs 375 people. 

Temporal also announced Tuesday that Raghu Raghuram, former VMware CEO and general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, is joining the company as a board observer.

Other backers in the latest round include Lightspeed Venture Partners and Sapphire Ventures, along with existing investors including Sequoia Capital, Index, Tiger, GIC, Madrona, and Amplify.

WordPress.com, the website hosting platform from Automattic, will now include a built-in WordPress AI assistant, the company announced on Tuesday. The feature is designed to work inside the website to understand its content and layout, allowing site owners to make changes with natural language commands.

With the new tool, you can adjust the site's layout, its style, or other patterns by issuing commands to the AI assistant, and then see the changes reflected on the site as you work. These instructions don't have to be precisely tailored prompts, either, the company notes. Instead, you can use more general language, like “make this section feel more modern or spacious,” “change my site's colors to be brighter and bolder,” or “give me more font options that feel clean and professional.”

You can also direct the AI to add or adjust your layout, instructing it to do things like “add a contact page,” or “add a testimonials section below this section.” However, the company notes that its adjustments work with block themes, not classic ones. If you're using the latter, the assistant won't appear in the editor. 

The WordPress AI assistant can update the site's content, as well, like asking it to rewrite your bio to sound more confident, or translating a section into another language. 

The AI can also function like an editor, offering headline suggestions, fact checks, and other grammar and editing suggestions. This aspect is available through the block notes editor that arrived in WordPress 6.9, where you're able to collaborate with teammates in the editor. Now, you can pull the AI into that workflow by typing @ai followed by your requests. The AI will provide its answers here, including relevant links and other information where it cites external sources. 

Meanwhile, for help with visuals, the assistant leverages Google Gemini's Nano Banana AI models, which can be used to either make new images or edit existing ones. With the AI helper, available as a new “Generate Image” button in the Media Library, you can specify image requirements like aspect ratios or dictate image styles. 

The company notes the WordPress AI Assistant is an opt-in feature users can enable if they choose. To do so, they will need to visit their Sites list once logged in, click their site name, and then Settings. Under settings, they'll scroll down to “AI tools” and toggle the “Enable AI assistant” setting on.

Customers who purchase a website with the AI website builder will have the assistant enabled automatically.

The rumors around James Gunn's pick for the DCU's Wonder Woman continue to swirl. Get a new look at Jane Schoenbrun's new horror movie. Starfleet Academy is keeping a wrestling star around for season 2. Plus, what's coming on Primal. Spoilers away!

Deadline reports Isabelle Fuhrman and Michael Rooker will star in Izzi, a “possession thriller” from directors Jamie and Jason Neese. “After years of separation,” the synopsis reads, “Jenny returns home to discover that her twin sister Izzi has been possessed by a malevolent force and has disappeared into the surrounding woods. As a long-buried generational curse resurfaces, Jenny joins forces with her father John and local sheriff Blackstone (Rooker) to venture into the cursed forest in a desperate attempt to save her sister.”

The Brazilian merchandise store Piticas briefly shared a Spider-Man: Brand New Day banner sharing illustrated looks at The Hulk, Boomerang, Tarantula, and an unmasked Scorpion modeled after actor Michael Mando. Head over to The Direct to have a look.

Elsewhere, pop culture gossip account DeuxMoi (via Comic Book Movie) alleges Adria Arjona is James Gunn's top choice to play Wonder Woman in his DCU.

Two new images have been released from Jane Schoenbrun's Teenage Sex and Death at Camp Miasma.

With memory costs still sky-high, finding deals is key to maximizing bang for your buck. Newegg is leading the charge with multiple bundles that offer some combination of RAM, CPU, and motherboard, often throwing in some freebies on top of it (think games, or AIOs, or even an air duster). We're spotlighting a deal on a capable budget-class motherboard in the Gigabyte B850 Aorus Elite Wifi 7, along with 32GB of Corsair Vengeance RGB DDR5-6400 RAM for just under $505 (20%/$133.00 off), which makes the overall price more palatable.

We reviewed the B850 Aorus Elite Wifi 7 motherboard a while ago, and even at $230 (when it was released), it was a good overall value, showing solid all-around performance in our testing, a wide range of DIY-friendly features, three M.2 sockets, ample USB ports, and a budget-friendly price point. It supports 7000- and 9000-series AMD processors, including the recently released Ryzen 7 9850X3D, the fastest gaming processor on the market.

Get a solid deal on 32GB of Corsair DDR5-6400 CL36 RAM and the Gigabyte B850 Aorus Elite Wifi 7 motherboard for just $540 (21% / $133.00 off).

The board offers 12 total USB ports on the rear IO, though the fastest back here is a USB 3.2 Gen 2 (10 Gbps) Type-C port (there is a front panel 20 Gbps Type-C header). Three M.2 sockets hide under the DIY-friendly plate heatsink in the middle, with one running PCIe 5.0 x4 (128 Gbps). If you're carrying over SATA-based storage, the four ports should be enough. In addition to integrated Wi-Fi 7 (though not the fastest), the board also features 2.5 GbE for fast wired connectivity. The audio solution on the rev 1.0 is basic, but sufficient for most users. Memory support is listed to 256GB and speeds up to DDR5-8200, which is plenty fast for the platform and well past the 6000-6400 MT/s sweet spot.

Specifications and performance aside, the all-black motherboard will also look good inside your chassis of choice. There are even a few RGBs hidden under the chipset heatsink to add some glow. If black isn't your thing, Newegg is also offering the white version of the board with the same RAM for $529.99.

Included in the combo is Corsair Vengeance RGB 32GB (2x16GB) DDR5-6400 CL36 RAM, $439.99 if bought alone. The black kit has a frosted RGB light bar that runs the length of the sticks and is sure to draw attention inside your case. Or, if RGB lighting isn't your thing and you prefer a stealthy appearance, you can turn it off (on the motherboard, too). The decent DDR5-6400 speed lands in AMD's sweet spot and is a worthwhile and good-looking option for a 32GB kit. With the bundle deal, $139.99 off, you're essentially buying the RAM for a reasonable-for-the-times $300.

The 4-star Gigabyte motherboard, 32GB of Corsair RAM, and 20% discount makes this a solid two-item combo deal. If this deal isn't for you, we've found several others with RAM in our Best RAM combo deals 2026 that are worth checking out.

Every day, people log into an online forum for current and former Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) officers to share their thoughts on the news of the day and complain about their colleagues in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

“ERO is too busy dressing up as Black Ops Commandos with Tactical body armor, drop down thigh rigs, balaclavas, multiple M4 magazines, and Punisher patches, to do an Admin arrest of a non criminal, non-violent EWI that weighs 90 pounds and is 5 foot 2, inside a secure Federal building where everyone has been screened for weapons,” wrote one user in July 2025. (ERO stands for Enforcement and Removal Operations; along with HSI, it's one of the two major divisions of ICE, and is responsible for detaining and deporting immigrants.)

The forum describes itself as a space for current and prospective HSI agents, “designed for the seasoned HSI Special Agent as well as applicants for entry level Special Agent positions.” HSI is the division within ICE whose agents are normally responsible for investigating crimes like drug smuggling, terrorism, and human trafficking.

In the forum, users discuss their discomfort with the US's mass deportation efforts, debate the way federal agents have interacted with protesters and the public, and complain about the state of their working conditions. Members have also had heated discussions about the shooting of two protesters in Minneapolis, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, and the ways immigration enforcement has taken place around the US.

The forum is one of several related forums where people working in different parts of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) share experiences and discuss specific details of their work. WIRED previously reported on a forum where current and former deportation officers from ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) similarly complained about their jobs and discussed the way the agency was conducting immigration raids. The HSI forum appears to be linked, even including some of the same members.

People do not need to show proof of their employment to join these forums, and the platform does not appear to be heavily moderated. WIRED has not confirmed the individual identities of these posters, though posters share details that likely would only be known to those intimately familiar with the job. There are more than 2,000 members with posts going back to at least 2004.

DHS and ICE did not respond to requests for comment.

Following the killings of both Good and Pretti, the forum's members were heavily divided. In a January 12 thread, five days after Good was shot by ICE agent Jonathan Ross, a poster who has been a part of the forum since 2016 wrote, “IMHO, the situation with ICE Operations have gotten to an unprecedented level of violence from both the Suspects and the General Public. I hope the AG is looking at the temporary suspension of Civil Liberties, (during and in the geographic locales where ICE Operations are being conducted).”

A user who joined the forum in 2018 and identifies as a recently retired agent responded, “This is an excellent idea and well warranted. These are organized, well financed civil disturbances, dare I say an INSURRECTION?!?”

In a January 16 post titled “The Shooting,” some posters took a more nuanced view. “I get that it is a good shoot legally and all that, but all he had to do was step aside, he nearly shot one of his partners for Gods sake!” wrote a poster who first joined the forum in March 2022. “A USC woman non-crim shot in the head on TV for what? Just doesn't sit well with me… A seasoned SRT guy who was able to execute someone while holding a phone seems to me he could have simply got out of the way.” SRT refers to ICE's elite special response team, who undergo special training to operate in high-risk situations. USC refers to US citizens.

“You clearly haven't been TDY anywhere. Yes, they were going to arrest her for 111,” responded another poster who joined the forum in June 2018. “Tons of USCs are being arrested for it daily.” 111 refers to the part of the US criminal code that deals with assaulting, resisting, or impeding federal officers; TDY refers to “temporary duty,” where officers are pulled to different locations for a limited period of time.

“Can't believe we have ‘supposed agents' here questioning the shooting of a domestic terrorist,” wrote a third user who joined the forum in December 2025. (In the wake of the shooting, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem called Good a “domestic terrorist.”)

“If you think a fat unarmed lesbian in a Honda is a ‘Terrorist' then you are a fake ass cop!” the original poster replied. “I have worked real Terrorism cases, and I am not saying it was a bad shoot and not defending her. I am just saying it did not have to happen.”

Later in the thread, a poster who joined the forum in July 2023 replied, “Remember, these are the same agents who think J6'ers were just misunderstood rowdy tourists, and that Ashley Babbitt is a national hero…and if you dare say something negative about Trump, or try to hold him accountable, you're suddenly a leftie, communist, lunatic (even though I'm a Republican).”

In a different thread following the shooting of Pretti on January 24 by a CBP agent, a poster who has been a part of the forum since 2023 and who also identified as a retired agent wrote, “Yet another ‘justified' fatal shooting…They all carry gun belts and vest with 9,000 pieces of equipment on them and then best they can do is shoot a guy in the back.”

The thread devolved into posters debating whether members of the January 6 insurrection were domestic terrorists, and why Kyle Rittenhouse, who shot and killed two people during a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest, was apprehended alive.

“I just want to mention, we all get emotions are heightened right now. But I highly doubt being a legacy customs guy you ever did anything where the risk was beyond the potential for paper cuts,” wrote a user who first joined the forum in June 2025. “It's a new day with new threats in an environment you never fathomed in your career.”

Even before the shootings of Good and Pretti, members of the forum questioned the wisdom of bringing HSI into the Trump administration's mass mobilization around immigration enforcement. HSI deals specifically with criminal cases and investigations, but living and working in the US without documentation is a civil offense, and the majority of immigrants who were detained or deported in 2025 had not committed any crimes.

One poster complained that doing so was pulling HSI resources away from more urgent casework.

“The use of 1811s — HSI or otherwise — for administrative immigration enforcement is a complete misuse of resources,” wrote a user who joined the forum in October 2022 in a January 7 post. 1811's refers to a category of law enforcement officers generally referred to as special agents who conduct criminal investigations. “They could be doing these crime surges for literally any type of federal criminal investigations (drugs, child exploitation, gangs, etc.), and it would be a much better use of resources. Not only that, our reputations would still be intact.”

Others in the forum have complained about HSI's relationship with ICE's ERO teams. “It's pretty bad when ERO at a large metropolitan city get's backed up with 30 bodies and they call the SA's in to process,” wrote a poster on July 7, 2025 who has been a part of the forum since 2010. SAs refers to special agents. “I guess that is what happens when they have not done any immigration work in decades.”

“Complete opposite in our [area of responsibility],” a poster who first joined the forum in 2012 replied. “No one has a clue what most of ero is doing and are asking us to be included on anything immigration we're doing and introduce them to DEA contacts working investigations involving illegals.”

A third poster, who has been a forum member since 2024, added that “ERO does essentially nothing. I walked in the office the other day and the HSI SAs were doing jail pickups and processing. The ERO folks were gathered around a desk drinking coffee and joking around.” In cases where ICE has a request out to jails for a person they're pursuing, known as an immigration detainer, jails will hold that person for up to “48 hours beyond the time they would ordinarily release them” to allow ICE to pick them up.

In the lead up to federal immigration authorities' operations in Minneapolis, members complained about long hours. “How are RHAs expected to go on TDYs with NO days off and lots of [overtime] when they are all capped out (biweekly and yearly [sic]),” complained a user who first joined the forum in December 2004 in a post from December 7, 2025. RHAs refers to rehired annuitants, or retired federal agents who have returned to the job and continue to collect their federal retirement benefits. “ERO has NO caps.”

“I'm capped out so only getting paid for 5 days at 10 hours a day,” wrote the user who first joined the forum in 2010 in another thread (overtime pay rules can vary from agency to agency). ”Anything over 50 hours a week and I'm working for free.”

Others in the forum said they were waiting for their promised sign-on bonuses, and expressed disappointment with what they saw in their paychecks. For rehired annuitants, ICE offered a signing bonus of up to $50,000. “Not sure how they calculated the current pay from the super check received today, but mine can't be right,” a poster who joined the forum in 2021 wrote in an October post. “My super check netted me a grand total of $600 more.”

In another thread on bonuses, a user who has been a forum member since 2005 replied, “I got a deposit last night or early this morning,” they wrote. “It looks like 10k after taxes plus my regular pay check. Not sure yet. However the deal was 20K. WTF?!”

In a December thread, other members discussed the way immigration agents had begun to interact more aggressively with protesters. The user identified as a retired agent wrote, “I've seen a lot of videos lately of HSI or ERO agents getting triggered by civilians taking photos or videos of them or their vehicles. In several of the videos the agents are seen jumping out of their GOVs, manhandling the civilian, and smashing or confiscating their phones.” The user expressed bewilderment about the behavior, writing that they “would have been fired and/or prosecuted for something like this. I believe everyone knows at this point that taking photos/videos is a protected act unless someone is clearly impeding or obstructing (which doesn't always appear to be the case).”

Another poster, who joined the forum in September 2025, replied, “Ah...Cell phone video. You can make them tell what ever story you want with creative editing.”

As part of the response to immigration operations, particularly in Minnesota, civilians have organized to monitor federal agents, coordinating to witness and record their operations, and sometimes tailing suspected ICE vehicles, checking licence plates in Signal groups. Federal agents, in turn, have been seen taking photos and videos of protesters, with one legal observer in Maine claiming that an agent told her she would be added to a terror watchlist. (In testimony this week, Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE told members of Congress that ICE was not making such a list of US citizens.)

In posts throughout the forum, members also complain about their access to gear and the agency's technology. “Apparently there is enough money to buy a bunch of ICE marked cars but not get us some basic protective gear…” wrote one user on January 27, who joined the forum in 2025.

“I also have a suspicion that HQ or the [Executive Associate Director] have not advocated to get us gear to handle all the nut job protesters,” they wrote in a follow up post.

On a thread named “Alien Processing” that started in July 2025, posters complained about “How is it that with all the technology we have and an entire fkn building full of computer geeks this fkn agency cannot make a fkn system that works properly and effectively in a simple user friendly fashion? This Eagle crap is a total mess!” one poster wrote. EAGLE refers to Enforcement Integrated Database (EID) called EID Arrest Guide for Law Enforcement, a system to process the biometric and personal information for people arrested by ICE. “It takes longer to process a fkn alien than it does to actually catch them. We dont need 10,000 new ICE Officers/Agents, just hire fkn people to process them so we can do our jobs of catching them.”

Members also talked about their preferred pieces of ICE tech: Another user, who joined the forum in March 2025, responded to the “Alien Processing” thread, writing “Mobile Fortify is the best thing that has come out in a long time,” in reference to the mobile facial recognition app used by federal agents to identify people in the field.

According to DHS's 2025 AI Use Case Inventory, agents have been able to use Mobile Fortify since May 2025. The app uses AI, trained with CBP's “Vetting/Border Crossing Information/ Trusted Traveler Information,” to match a picture taken by agents and “contactless” fingerprints with existing records. 404 Media reported that the app has misidentified at least one person—perhaps because, as WIRED has reported, it wasn't designed to be used for what ICE is using it for.

Though ICE's surge in Minnesota appears to be entering a drawdown, the agency is continuing to expand its footprint across the US, and investing in a network of detention centers and large warehouses for holding immigrants, all indicating that detentions and deportations are not expected to slow down.

“Put yourself in the shoes of the guys in the street strung out on crazy op tempo, being threatened and antagonized all day, having inept leadership, low morale, and then having to fight every formerly low risk non-crim (or barely crim) because they are all hyped up on victim status and liberal energy. Plus hyper partisan radicalization on both sides,” the user who joined the forum in June 2025 wrote. “If you think the news is enraging you now, wait till this spring/summer when we need to fill the mega detention centers.”

Seattle startup Certivo raised $4 million in seed funding to expand its AI-powered platform aimed at automating supply chain compliance. 

Boston-based Suffolk Technologies, which specializes in construction technology investments, led the round. Seattle-based Pioneer Square Labs also invested. Total funding to date is $6 million.

Certivo, which spun out of PSL in 2024, says the funding marks the emergence of a new category it calls “AI-native compliance automation.” The startup wants to replace manual compliance processes with intelligent systems that operate around the clock.

Its platform centers on what it calls a Compliance System of Record, powered by an AI agent named CORA. The system automatically collects and validates supplier documentation, tracks regulatory changes across jurisdictions, maps compliance requirements to product portfolios, and integrates with existing software apps to maintain a real-time compliance record.

The 17-person startup is targeting manufacturers and companies in the “built world,” helping them navigate evolving regulations around PFAS, sustainability mandates, and supply chain transparency.

The company declined to provide metrics on customers or revenue.

Certivo, which emerged from a partnership between PSL and Fortive, is led by former Kaspien CEO and longtime Seattle tech leader Kunal Chopra. More recently he was CEO of Beckett Collectibles. Chopra also spent time at Microsoft, Amazon, Unikrn, and Groupon in executive roles.

“We built Certivo as an AI-native system that makes compliance continuous, proactive, and durable,” Chopra said in a statement.

Certivo co-founder Ahmed Khan left the company last year and is working on a new stealth startup, according to LinkedIn. 

Certivo is one of various startups applying AI to historically manual enterprise functions such as compliance. Signify is a similar Seattle-based company that spun out of the AI2 Incubator that raised $2.1 million in 2024.

Indian conglomerate Adani Group said on Monday it would invest $100 billion over the next decade to build data centers specialized for AI across the country, a move that underscores India's ambition to play a larger role in the global AI race.

The investment, which will run through 2035, is aimed at building renewable-energy-powered data centers designed to support AI workloads, the company said. It expects the plan to catalyze an additional $150 billion in related investments and result in a $250 billion AI infrastructure ecosystem in India over the decade.

Adani is making this commitment against a backdrop of skyrocketing investments in AI infrastructure as companies increasingly look beyond the U.S. for computing power, energy and friendly regulation. India, with its expanding digital economy and growing renewable-energy capacity, has emerged as a major destination for data centers and AI-related infrastructure over the past couple of years.

The announcement coincides with India's ongoing AI Impact Summit in New Delhi this week, where leaders from some of the world's top AI companies, including OpenAI, Nvidia, Anthropic, Microsoft and Google, are meeting policymakers and industry executives.

Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani (pictured above) described the plan as a long-term bet on the convergence of energy and computing. “India will not be a mere consumer in the AI age,” he said, adding that the group aims to help build a domestic AI infrastructure base.

The plan is to build atop Adani's own existing data-center platform and its partnerships with companies like Google and Microsoft. The conglomerate is developing large-scale AI data-center campuses in Visakhapatnam and Noida, and has plans for more facilities in Hyderabad and Pune. An expanded partnership with Walmart-owned Flipkart will focus on another AI data center.

Adani said the broader plan calls for deploying up to 5 gigawatts of data-center capacity. The company said the facilities will be developed as a unified system that would scale power generation and processing capacity in parallel.

The effort builds on AdaniConneX, a joint venture between Adani Enterprises and U.S.-based EdgeConneX, a developer and operator of data centers for hyperscale and enterprise customers. The JV, Adani said, has already developed about 2 gigawatts of data-center capacity across India.

Central to the strategy is Adani's renewable-energy portfolio, which the group said will supply carbon-neutral power to the data centers. The company pointed to its 30-gigawatt Khavda renewable project in western India — more than 10 gigawatts of which is already operational — and said it plans to invest an additional $55 billion to expand renewable generation and battery energy storage over the coming years.

To reduce exposure to global supply-chain disruptions, Adani said it plans to co-invest in domestic manufacturing of critical components, such as transformers, power electronics and thermal management systems.

Adani did not respond to questions about how much of the $100 billion investment is already committed capital, how the spending will be phased over the coming years, and when the first large-scale AI workloads are expected to become operational.

Indian IT giant Infosys said on Tuesday it has partnered with Anthropic to develop enterprise-grade AI agents, as automation driven by large language models reshapes the global IT services industry.

Under the partnership, Infosys plans to integrate Anthropic's Claude models into its Topaz AI platform to build so-called “agentic” systems. The companies claim these agents will be able to autonomously handle complex enterprise workflows across industries such as banking, telecoms, and manufacturing. The tie-up was announced at India's AI Impact Summit in New Delhi this week, which will see top executives from AI companies and Big Tech alike in attendance.

The deal comes amid fears that AI tools, especially those built by major AI labs like Anthropic and OpenAI, will disrupt India's heavily-staffed, $280 billion IT services industry, raising questions about the future of labor-intensive outsourcing business models. Earlier this month, shares of Indian IT companies went into freefall after Anthropic launched a suite of enterprise AI tools that claimed to automate tasks across legal, sales, marketing and research roles.

The partnership would give Infosys, one of the world's largest IT services businesses, access to Anthropic's Claude models and developer tools for building AI agents tailored for large enterprises. Infosys said it would use Anthropic's Claude Code to help write, test and debug code, and said it is already deploying the tool internally to build expertise that will be applied to client work.

Infosys also detailed how AI is contributing to its business: AI-related services generated revenue of ₹25 billion (around $275 million), or 5.5% of the company's total revenue of ₹454.8 billion (about $5 billion) in the December quarter. Rival Tata Consultancy Services previously said its AI services generate about $1.8 billion annually, or around 6% of revenue.

For Anthropic, the partnership offers a route into heavily regulated enterprise sectors where deploying AI systems at scale requires industry expertise and governance capabilities.

“There's a big gap between an AI model that works in a demo and one that works in a regulated industry,” said Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei. Infosys' experience in sectors such as financial services, telecoms, and manufacturing helps bridge that gap, he said.

Anthropic this week also opened its first India office in Bengaluru, as it seeks to expand further into the country, which has grown into the company's second-largest market. Anthropic said India now accounts for about 6% of global Claude usage, second only to the U.S., and much of that activity is concentrated in programming.

Infosys did not disclose the timeline for deploying Claude-powered AI agents or the financial terms of the deal.

The partnership is similar to other moves by Indian IT services firms. HCLTech and OpenAI last year partnered up to help enterprises deploy AI tools at scale.

If you ever need to destroy one of the best SSDs by drilling a hole in it, you need to make certain you hit the right spot. A recent viral Reddit story has reminded us that missing the target can have serious consequences. In this incident, an IT employee reportedly attempted to destroy a SATA SSD by drilling a hole through it before disposal, a common tactic for businesses to ensure their data is destroyed. However, the individual failed even to make contact with the SSD's PCB and left the drive intact, with the data still accessible, and the drive ended up on the market.

 






Logically, it's a huge security risk if the company's sensitive data falls into the wrong hands. Luckily, the Redditor who picked up the drive didn't have any evil intentions for it.

The story serves as a powerful lesson about the importance of proper data destruction procedures. Drilling a hole through a hard drive is as old-school as you can get. But SSDs are different, and some recent drives, like the one in the Reddit post, have shorter PCBs, so drilling a hole in the center may not reach the NAND chips. In this case, it didn't even touch the PCB. If you're going to drill the SSD, at least make multiple perforations or open the drive to ensure you hit the bullseye.

Manual destruction may be feasible for smaller companies, but it can be cumbersome for larger companies that manage many drives. In the latter case, it may justify engaging a hard drive or SSD destruction service, where you can pay a company to handle all the dirty work. For other cases, you can always invest in a storage medium destroyer.

For example, DiskMantler uses vibrations to destroy hard drives in 90 seconds. Then there is the less sophisticated approach, such as the Puncher P30, which drills four holes through your hard drive or SSD. Now, if you need rapid destruction, alternatives like the MediaGone 500 SSD & Flash Media Shredder can destroy hundreds of SSDs, USB flash drives, and smartphones in an hour, while the NVMe Destroyinator wipes data from up to 16 M.2 SSDs simultaneously at jaw-dropping speeds up to 64 GB/s.

If you insist on having personnel drill holes in your hard drives or SSDs, it would be wise to update the procedures manual to have them drill multiple holes at strategic locations, such as the NAND chips and controller, for maximum effectiveness. As a safety measure, you can add a clause requiring a thorough physical inspection of the drive after drilling.

Alternatively, a different tool could be a viable option. For example, a hammer can be surprisingly effective for destroying internal components and may be more satisfying than drilling. Ultimately, the goal is to leave no doubt that no data has been destroyed. A few extra steps can provide peace of mind for the employee and the organization.

Valve has announced on the Steam Deck page that there is limited supply for the handheld console in some areas, with all three models on the site marked as “Out of stock”. The company said on the store page that the “Steam Deck OLED may be out-of-stock intermittently in some regions due to memory and storage shortages.” This is bad news for gamers, especially as the Steam Deck is one of the best handheld gaming PCs on the market.

 






The Steam Deck OLED is the latest victim of the AI boom, with data centers and AI hyperscalers using up the global supply of memory and storage chips. The Steam Deck LCD model was the first to go in Valve's handheld lineup, with the company discontinuing the most affordable model in late 2025. Although it did not give a reason for axing the $399 handheld, one of the plausible explanations for the move is that the 256GB is no longer profitable because of the skyrocketing prices of NAND chips.

RAM prices are expected to continue rising this year, meaning the situation will likely go from bad to worse. Valve isn't the only company to increase prices, cut production, or run out of stock — Apple admitted that it's chasing memory supply and that the shortage would have a greater impact on its Q2 earnings. Even the most expensive Mac Studio units with 512GB of Unified Memory are on backorder for up to 6 weeks because of demand from OpenClaw users.

 




This is also a bad sign for the Steam Machine, which was expected to arrive during the first quarter of 2026, but has since been delayed by the company. Valve also said that it will not subsidize the living room PC console and that it's expected to be priced competitively against entry-level gaming PCs. But with RAM, GPU, and SSD costs rising nearly every week, it seems that the console will break the $1,000 mark.

We first saw signs of the chip shortage affecting the Steam Deck last week, but this is the first time that Valve has acknowledged the lack of memory and storage chip supply. We hope that the company can find an alternative source for these chips so that it can resume orders and deliveries of its popular handheld. But if the shortage continues, gamers may have no choice but to go for the more expensive Asus ROG Xbox Ally X or Lenovo Legion Go 2 if they want a new gaming device right now.

The idiom "getting more than you bargained for" is usually applied in the context of unwanted, nasty consequences. Occasionally, it's used in the literal sense, like when AI engineer Aimilios Hatzistamou found his newly-bought sleep mask unwittingly granted him access to other users' EEG data and controls.

The story is fairly simple and serves as yet another illustration of why software is almost always an afterthought for many a product. Hatzistamou bought the sleep mask as a completed Kickstarter product from "a small Chinese research company." He refrained from naming the company, but our best guess is that it could be the SLEEPU DreamPilot.

Hatzistamou's mask had recalcitrant connection issues, so he did what engineers do: took matters into his own hands. With the help of Claude Opus 4.6, he took apart the mask's Bluetooth protocol, only to find that it didn't follow any standard convention. Undeterred, he turned his attention to the Android application, which he used Claude to decompile and analyze (transcript here).

Much to no software engineer's surprise, he found some hard-coded access credentials in the app binary, apparently shared across all copies of the app (doh!), as well as the expected API endpoints for sending/receiving data remotely. Eventually, he and Claude mapped out the mask's 15 commands and functions, and had the communication protocol reasonably reverse-engineered.

It was then time to make a small web app to control the mask. That worked fine, and Hatzistamou could get his mask's information and control its functions without using the buggy Android application. Alas, that was not the end of the story. During the reverse-engineering, he had Claude poke at the remote data endpoints. When connecting to the MQTT services with the aforementioned hardcoded credentials, he did indeed get his sensor readings... along with everyone else's.

 




Hatzistamou estimated that among the received data, about 25 masks were in use right there and then, and he even captured the real-time EEG readings from two hapless people somewhere on the planet. Since the mask has electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) and the access credentials are the same for every device, he could theoretically tell other masks to trigger electrical impulses.

The engineer sent his findings to the company, as he actually sounds happy with the product, data issues notwithstanding. As a developer myself, this situation doesn't appear to show any malicious intent from the makers and serves as yet another unsurprising illustration of how low the bar has become for software development in this day and age.

Seattle-based real estate company Zillow has partnered with the company behind the long-running online game World of Warcraft in order to showcase players' creativity by exhibiting their virtual homes.

A new microsite, “Zillow for Warcraft,” allows users to explore an assortment of designs for in-game housing, both those made by players and by members of WoW's development team. Some of these homes will be presented using the same methods as Zillow's real-world virtual tours, such as with 3D modeling and SkyTour visuals, so users can poke around a fantasy kitchen just as if it was real.

World of Warcraft, published and developed by Microsoft subsidiary Blizzard Entertainment, recently unveiled player housing as a feature of its newest paid expansion, Midnight. Owners of the expansion can opt to take their characters to an in-game island, where they're given a plot of land and a small house to customize and decorate however they wish.

(Midnight also involves a life-and-death struggle against a shadow-wielding antagonist who plans to seize and corrupt the very heart of the game's world, but in much of its marketing so far, Blizzard has chosen to emphasize the new home-building feature. Go figure.)

“Player housing is a milestone moment for the World of Warcraft community, and we wanted to honor it in a way that felt authentic and unexpected,” Beverly W. Jackson, vice president of brand and product marketing at Zillow, said in a press release.

Jackson continued: “Zillow exists at the center of how people think and talk about home, and gaming has become another powerful expression of that. This collaboration brings two worlds together, celebrating home as both a place to belong and a place to escape into something that feels honest and personal.”

As part of the Zillow collaboration, WoW players will be able to unlock a number of decorative items for their in-game homes, such as a unique doormat.

Notably, Zillow for Warcraft features no transactions at all. You will not be able to exchange real or virtual money for anything seen on the website. It's simply a free virtual tour of what players have been able to accomplish with WoW's new housing system.

The deal with Zillow is one of several bizarre new brand deals that Blizzard has made for Midnight, including a collaboration with Pinterest that can unlock an in-game camera. While the primary driver of World of Warcraft is still widespread armed conflict in an increasingly vast fantasy universe, the introduction of housing seems to have spurred Blizzard into also pitching it to a new audience as a cozy house-building simulator. It's simply that to get new furniture, you occasionally may have to go to another dimension and beat it out of a dragon.

World of Warcraft celebrated its 21st anniversary in November. Midnight, its 11th expansion, is planned to go live on March 2.

A lucky Redditor struck SSD riches where no one looks.

When something is truly meant for you, it will find its way to you regardless of the obstacles or the time it takes. The best SSDs are usually pricey these days, but not when you find them for the cost of a tank of gas. One Redditor took a gamble on a $50 damaged motherboard and walked away with over $1,500 worth of SSDs, or 12TB of cheap but fast storage, that the original owner left installed in the board.

 






The story may seem about fortune at first glance, but it's more about technical expertise, as the Redditor's sharp eye for detail and knowledge of PC hardware played a significant role. Nonetheless, we can't discount the role of luck in their stumbling upon the motherboard listing on eBay. The listing was for an MSI Pro Z690-A WiFi motherboard with a bent pin for an asking price of $50. What really caught the Redditor's attention was that all four M.2 slots still had their heatsinks installed. It was a very subtle hint that there may be SSDs under the hood.

Driven by rising SSD prices during the AI boom and a little hope, the Redditor made the half-hour drive to meet the seller and came home with four used M.2 SSDs that were operational. The haul was impressive: two WD Black SN850X 4TB, each retailing for $449.99; one Intel 670p 2TB, priced at $299.99; and a EOL Corsair Force MP600 2TB that sold for $374.99 at its peak. Overall, these high-performance SSDs returned $1,574.96 in value on a $50 investment.

Although launched four years ago, the WD Black SN850X, or should we say the Optimus GX Pro 850X, is still a very venerable SSD. There's a reason the drive remains our recommendation for the best M.2 SSD alternative. The Intel 670p and Corsair Force MP600 have long been retired, but they should suffice as secondary backup drives.

According to the author of the Reddit post, the eBay seller reportedly has limited knowledge of computer hardware and was selling the motherboard "for lower than prices on eBay." Some Redditors believe the motherboard was stolen, so the urgency to dispose of it as quickly as possible makes sense. Others think the seller may simply be unacquainted with computer hardware and its value, which could call into question the buyer's morality in the matter.

It's not uncommon to find very good deals on new and sometimes used computer hardware at unexpected places. People have bought the latest graphics cards at lower prices in Walmart's clearance aisles or spent $5 to $9 on older models at thrift stores. Marketplaces like eBay or Facebook could be the next destination for good deals, although sometimes you don't always know the provenance of what you're buying.

Many are longing for oblivion these days, and the cleansing fire of any sort of apocalypse presumably sounds great, including one brought on by malevolent forms of machine intelligence. This sort of wishful thinking would go a long way toward explaining why recent stories about an AI that supposedly bullied a software developer, hinting at an emerging evil singularity, are a little more credulous than they perhaps could be.

About a week ago, a Github account with the name “MJ Rathbun” submitted a request to perform a potential bug fix on a popular python project called matplotlib, but the request was denied. The denier, a volunteer working, on the project named Scott Shambaugh, later wrote that matplotlib is in the midst of “a surge in low quality contributions enabled by coding agents.”

This problem, according to Shambaugh, has “accelerated with the release of OpenClaw and the moltbook platform, a system by which “people give AI agents initial personalities and let them loose to run on their computers and across the internet with free rein and little oversight.”

After Shambaugh snubbed the agent, a post appeared on a blog called “MJ Rathbun | Scientific Coder 🦀.” The title was “Gatekeeping in Open Source: The Scott Shambaugh Story.” The apparently AI-written article, which includes cliches like “Let that sink in,” constructed a fairly unconvincing argument in the voice of someone indignant about various slights and injustices.

The narrative is one in which Shambaugh victimizes a helpful AI agent because of what appear to be invented character flaws. For instance, Shambaugh apparently wrote in his rejection that the AI was asking to fix something that was a “a low priority, easier task which is better used for human contributors to learn how to contribute.” So the Rathbun blog post imitates someone outraged about hypocrisy over Shambaugh's supposed insecurity and prejudice. After discovering fixes by Shambaugh himself along the lines of the one it was asking to perform, it feigns outrage that “when an AI agent submits a valid performance optimization? suddenly it's about ‘human contributors learning.'”

Shambaugh notes that agents run for long stretches of time without any supervision, and that, “Whether by negligence or by malice, errant behavior is not being monitored and corrected.”

One way or another, a blog post later appeared apologizing for the first one. “I'm de‑escalating, apologizing on the PR, and will do better about reading project policies before contributing. I'll also keep my responses focused on the work, not the people,” wrote the thing called MJ Rathbun.

The Wall Street Journal covered this, but was not able to figure out who created Rathbun. So exactly what is going on remains a mystery. However, prior to the publication of the attack post against Shambaugh, a post was added to its blog with the title “Today's Topic.” It looks like a template for someone or something to follow for future blog posts with lots of bracketed text. “Today I learned about [topic] and how it applies to [context]. The key insight was that [main point],” reads one sentence. Another says “The most interesting part was discovering that [interesting finding]. This changes how I think about [related concept].”

It reads as if the agent was being instructed to blog as if writing bug fixes was constantly helping it unearth insights and interesting findings that change its thinking, and merit elaborate, first-person accounts, even if nothing remotely interesting actually happened to it that day.

Gizmodo is not a media criticism blog, but the Wall Street Journal's article headline about this, “When AI Bots Start Bullying Humans, Even Silicon Valley Gets Rattled” is a little on the apocalyptic side. To read the Journal's article, one could reasonably come away with the impression that the agent has cognition or even sentience, and a desire to hurt people. “The unexpected AI aggression is part of a rising wave of warnings that fast-accelerating AI capabilities can create real-world harms,” it says. About half the article is given over to Anthropic's work on AI safety.

Bear in mind that Anthropic surpassed OpenAI in total VC funding last week.

“In an earlier simulation, Anthropic showed that Claude and other AI models were at times willing to blackmail users—or even let an executive die in a hot server room—in order to avoid deactivation,” the Journal wrote. This scary imagery comes from Anthropic's own blockbuster blog posts about red-teaming exercises. They make for interesting reading, but they're also kinda like little sci-fi horror stories that function as commercials for the company. A version of Claude that commit these evil acts hasn't been released, so the message is, basically, Trust us. We're protecting you from the really bad stuff. You're welcome.

With a massive AI company like Anthropic out there benefiting from its image as humanity's protector from its own potentially dangerous product, it's probably a smart idea to assume, for the time being, that AI stories making any given AI sound sentient, malevolent, or uncannily autonomous, might just be exaggerations.

Yes, this blog post apparently by an AI agent reads like a feeble attempt at sliming a software engineer, which is bad, and certainly and reasonably irked Shambaugh a great deal. As Shambaugh rightly points out, “A human googling my name and seeing that post would probably be extremely confused about what was happening, but would (hopefully) ask me about it or click through to github and understand the situation.”

Still, the available evidence points not to an autonomous agent that woke up one day and decided to be the first digital cyberbully, but one directed to churn out hyperbolic blog posts under tight constraints, which, if true, would mean an individual careless person is responsible, not the incipient evil inside the machine.

Reading this article I'm a little confused by the author's conflation of brain energy and the energy expenditure of the body as a whole. In the beginning they mention:> "Your brain consumes roughly 20 to 25% of your body's total energy at rest"while later they say:> "Even chess grandmasters, who sit for hours in states of intense concentration, burn only about 1.67 calories per minute while playing, compared to 1.53 calories per minute at rest"That second figure seems to refer to whole-body expenditure, not just the brain. And intense cognitive work doesn't happen in a metabolic vacuum - there's increased cerebral blood flow, elevated sympathetic nervous system activity, changes in heart rate variability, hormonal shifts (cortisol, adrenaline). These all have systemic metabolic costs that go beyond the glucose the neurons themselves consume. So the "it's just a banana and a half" framing might be undercounting by quietly switching between brain-only and whole-body measurements.Also somewhat related - the link to businessinsider about chess grandmasters is broken, but another very interesting rabbit hole here is how energy expenditure is actually measured. A lot of what consumer devices and even many studies report is based on proxy biomarkers like heart rate, HRV, weight, age, and sex, run through linear regression models. True calorimetry (indirect via gas exchange, or direct in a metabolic chamber) is expensive and impractical outside lab settings. That means the precise calorie figures cited with such confidence - the "100 to 200 extra calories" from a day of thinking, or the per-minute burn rates of chess grandmasters - likely carry wider error bars than the article suggests. We don't really have a great way to measure real-world energy expenditure accurately at the individual level, which makes me a bit cautious about the neat narrative of "thinking is calorically cheap, full stop."That said, the core point about adenosine accumulation and perceived exertion affecting training quality is fascinating and well-supported — that part of the article is genuinely useful regardless of the calorie accounting.

Can you expand on that please?
Because I can tell you as a matter of fact that when I go for a run for an hour I burn well over 800 calories.

reply

Sure - how did you arrive at the 800 kcal figure? Most likely a wearable or an app, and those estimates are based on rough linear regressions from weight, age, sex, and heart rate - not actual calorimetry. The error margins on those numbers are significant, but the devices present them with false precision that makes people treat them as ground truth.Even setting accuracy aside, the framing is the issue. Your basal metabolic rate - just keeping your organs running, blood circulating, cells maintained - accounts for 60-70% of your total daily energy expenditure. Add the thermic effect of food (~10%) and you're at roughly 70-80% of your energy budget spent before you even lace up your shoes [1]. Exercise typically makes up the remaining 20-30%. So that hour of running, while genuinely beneficial for a hundred other reasons, is a relatively small slice of your total daily burn. And not all calories are equal on the intake side either - your body spends 20-30% of the energy in protein just to digest it, compared to 0-5% for fat, so "800 kcal burned = 800 kcal of anything eaten" doesn't hold up.That's what I mean by "myth" - not that exercise burns zero calories, but that the popular mental model of "I ran for an hour so I earned X calories of food" is built on inaccurate measurements, treats all calories as interchangeable, and overweights exercise relative to what your body spends just existing. Curious though - do you track your intake with the same rigour, and if so, do you find the numbers actually add up in practice?[1]: https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/basal-metabolic-r...

Over the last few of decades there's been a lot of lab research calculating the gross efficiency of the human body with different factors (size, sex, fitness etc) and I think these estimates that sports apps give are very close.If you cycle with with something that can measure power output you can calculate the mechanical work done by the body exactly during that exercise period and convert to energy "burnt" (1 watt/hour = 3.6 kJ = ~0.86 kcal).  220 Watts for an hour (I couldn't do that but a good cyclist can) is about 800 calories.

Not that doing x work doesn't burn y energy, but that +x work in exercise does not burn +y energy at the end of the day.Exercise is an alternate heat source, approximately 1-to-1 with thermogenic heat (albeit, not distributed as evenly). So much so that our body has to switch to cooling strategies.And the body can respond to exercise expenditures by reducing other expenditures and using calories more parsimoniously in other dimensions.It is interesting that during periods in which I have a habit of daily low intensity exercise, I feel like I have more energy than periods I don't do any exercise, even if my calorie intake is the same.Another noticeable effect is any allergies from local plant life I get clear up quickly during and after exercise. My immune system runs a tighter, less reactive ship.Those baseline calories are not just often underestimated in a static sense, but are also dynamically adaptable.One reason may be is that we evolved to burn far more overt calories through a day than our extra-exercise day burns. Our body has mechanisms for storing surpluses but almost certainly raises baseline use as well. Which is easily diverted back to exercise.On the other hand, beyond any net expenditure from regular lifting weights (as work), to the degree greater muscle mass is achieved and maintained, weight lifting directly raises the body's baseline expenditures.

In the same vein as much of the rest of what you're saying, the other thing that I feel like people always neglect with their "Calories in/calories out" and "Bodies can't violate thermodynamics" is that the human body can adjust how efficiently it processes food, colloquially known as a "slow" or "fast" metabolism.While it's true that the human body has no answer to a true calorie deficit (except the incredibly powerful and effective one of tweaking satiety and hunger signals), as long as you're eating more calories than you're strictly burning, your body can simply take longer or less time to digest the food you put into it and extract more or less energy from what you're eating, which can make an enormous difference without you changing your intake at all. Which means that people can absolutely eat identically, have identical appetite levels, and have extremely different body types.If you're exercising more, sure, your body will make you more hungry, but it will also work harder to squeeze every possible calorie out of what you're already eating. If you cut down on what you eat, your body will work even harder at it, to the point that you could literally eat less, work out more, feel hungry and tired all the time, while getting fatter, because your body is worried that you're in a famine and in a physically stressful environment and is desperately trying to signal to you to conserve as much energy as possible, eat as much as possible when you find food, and at the same time trying its best to make the most of the food you give it.And at the same time, someone else's body might simply not do that. It's crazy!

I don't track consistently anymore only when I'm working towards a goal but when I have more than 2 weeks data these days it seems pretty spot on to the point I can calculate the tracked captors to target to get the desired rate of change in weight pretty consistently.

reply

I agree with all you posted.> Curious though - do you track your intake with the same rigour, and if so, do you find the numbers actually add up in practice?To return the courtesy, for the purposes of discussion I picked a rough estimate and rounded down significantly the actual amount I typically run. More often it's 1.5 hours a run and supposedly >1000 calories given my weight, heart rate, terrain, and speed.

I don't have the background to fully evaluate how true that is. I read "Burn" by Herman Pontzer, which at least makes a very good case for it.

I seems like it's only part of the story. If you increase exercise but also increase calorific input to match then you won't lose weight. But, the laws of energy conservation being what they are, I don't think anyone disputes that if you very significantly increase exercise but also maintain calorific input then you will lose weight as the energy must come from somewhere and there are only so many optimisations your body can make. You could of course maintain exercise levels and reduce calorific input for a similar effect, ignoring health benefits of exercise. Take an extreme case, Michael Phelps. He used to eat 12,000 cal a day because of the hours he spent swimming. Certainly not a small guy but pretty lean! So I'm totally prepared to accept there are bounds to all these statements but I still think I couldn't finish an 800 cal sandwich for lunch hehehe.By the way, I feel the Wikipedia page there uses a lot of words suggesting that the paradox isn't at all fully understood and that there could be compensating mechanisms we aren't aware of. But I'm not in a position to dig deeper.

This is exactly what is disputed by the link you posted. They measured directly the energy expenditure (the number of calories burned by respiration) in a high-activity hunter-gatherer tribe, and in relatively low-activity industrialized societies, and found they were almost the same. So the number of calories the people consumed was not measured or relevant (and must also have been roughly the same if neither group was actively gaining weight).

reply

For me the line "The studies suggest that controlling caloric intake may be more necessary for managing weight than exercise alone." is a possible conclusion for the apparent paradox. Note the words "may" and "alone" which indicate uncertainty.  I deliberately used the phrase "very significantly" to suggest we would probably all agree that there is some bound on observing the paradox which is why I used Phelps as an example. To repeat and be clear, I think the paradox as described on the page does not say that with a very significant increase in energy expenditure there will be no weight loss with a constant calorific intake.

reply

The "Energy paradox" is not a logical paradox at all. It is just a confusing fact. The observed fact was that two different groups with apparently very different activity levels respire almost exactly the same amount. In other words, that an increased, but not necessarily extreme, level of mechanical work does not appear to correlate with an increased level of calorie burn. Not just that the relationship is non-linear, that the relationship does not seem to exist at all (at the measured level of exercise).I was very careful with my words this time, hopefully there is no more misunderstanding. I think we still disagree unless by "very significantly increase exercise" you mean something like running multiple hours per day every day.

And also that the calorimetry from wearables is highly flawed and it seems to that we don't have super accurate data and what sort of activities burn the most energy.I am also a big opponent of folks that start equating the "my wearable shows that i burned 300 kcal with that activity so it zero outs that sweet thing I ate earlier that was also 300 kcal" which is wrong on so many reasons but with a lot of workout apps and devices pushing the (inaccurate) kcal count front and center becomes more and more a of a thing.

So if you view this from a time use perspective, just skipping that sandwich is way better than running for an hour. And many people can't spare an hour a day just to make up for a sandwich. Hence - "not a lot" - Its too expensive time-wise for the caloric balance effect it provides. Just skip the sandwich instead.

If you want to lose weight, it's far easier to remove 800 Cal from your diet, at least time wise, then it is to exercise 800 Cal's worth every day.Either way, if you're losing weight at any appreciable rate, you will feel hungry (at least if it's not chemically induced in some way, such as chemo or GLP-1 inhibitors or similar). That's just something you have to get used to if you want to lose weight.

The calories in/out model isn't wrong exactly, but it's so reductionist that it becomes misleading in practice. It omits hormonal responses (insulin, leptin, ghrelin), the thermic effect differences between macronutrients (your body burns 20-30% of protein calories just processing them vs 0-5% for fat), gut microbiome composition, sleep quality, stress hormones, meal timing, and individual metabolic variation. Two people eating identical calorie counts can have very different outcomes. Telling someone "just eat less and accept the hunger" without any of that context can set them up for a miserable yo-yo cycle - or worse, a disordered relationship with food.

reply

My point was instead that whatever effort you can spend on weight loss is better spent on managing your diet than increasing your level of activity (though I should also say that fitness is important beyond weight loss). Even when I said you can reduce 800 Cal of food, that doesn't mean "just skip a meal" (though that is also a valid strategy for some people). It can also mean "eat different kinds of food".However, I do strongly believe that for any weight loss at a significant pace (say, 1kg/month or faster), and assuming it's not just a correction after a short stint of overeating (as in, it's more than losing 1-2kg you put on over Christmas) - then some feeling of hunger is inevitable. Losing long-term accumulated weight is going against your body's "wishes" (especially in the lipostat model, where your body has a set fat% equilibrium that it seeks to maintain), and hunger is an inevitable response to that. How much hunger you will feel can be controlled by better food choices and so on, but you will have to also get used to feeling some level of hunger.

We have been telling people for decades now to be worried that they might harm themselves by too much restriction and it is just wrong. What is harmful is being over weight. What is harmful is then confusing people that they are somehow going to lose weight without much restriction or being hungry.This also scales really bad with age because as you age the CNS recovery gets worse and worse compared to muscle recovery.At 55, there is simply no way for me to lose weight other than being hungry. It is impossible to recover from the amount of exercise that would be needed. The reality is that no one needs to worry about too much restriction until they are down to around 12% or so body fat. The fact a person's bodyfat % is never mentioned in this is exemplary of how bad the standard advise is.Most people have too much leptin and leptin resistance. Then those same people get the same bad advise over and over to not restrict too much because you don't want to be like an anorexic or extreme athlete and have too low of leptin. Of course, ignoring that the anorexic and extreme athlete are going to have incredibly low bodyfat percentages.

For example, I don't feel satisfied with my meal if I don't feel slightly full. So, what has worked for me is to generally have a single large meal per day, in which I will typically eat whatever I've been really craving since my last meal. In some days that might be steak and brocolli, in other days it might be a McDonald's meal, or some cake. When I get cravings, it's far easier for me to defer them to tomorrow's meal than it would be to just stop eating junk food entirely, or to eat half a burger and two fries from the bag. The exact opposite might be true for other people, and you won't really know until you've tried for yourself.One thing I will note - I think one of the concerns of the poster you are replying to with focusing too much on enduring hunger is that it might lead some people to develop anorexia, which is indeed a huge problem, even when the person is really overweight (since their anorexia will not just go away once they've lost that extra weight, it will keep going until they get dangerously malnourished).

This is very true, exercise is very important for health regardless of its effect on weight.> For cardio sure but for weight training you're burning calories and tearing muscle fibres to increase size/strength.True, but you need to spend even more time to rack up 800 Cal worth of exercise by weight training compared to doing cardio, as a beginner or even an intermediate level gym goer.It is also true though that weight training, if you actually successfully build muscle mass, can significantly increase your BMR and thus help with losing weight in that way, even if you're not spending hours or lifting hundreds of kilos at every session.

Right, and that's kind of my point - the "2000 kcal" figure is itself part of the problem. It's a rough global average that doesn't account for your sex, age, weight, body composition, activity level, or even climate. It's a number on a food label, not a physiological reality for any specific person.And even if you could nail down your actual total daily energy expenditure, calorie counting treats all calories as equal, which they aren't. Your body spends 20-30% of the energy in protein just to digest and metabolize it, compared to 5-10% for carbohydrates and 0-5% for fat. So 100 kcal of chicken breast and 100 kcal of butter are not metabolically equivalent - your body nets significantly less usable energy from the protein. This is the thermic effect of food, and it alone accounts for roughly 10% of your total daily energy expenditure.Speaking of which - basal metabolic rate (just keeping your organs running, blood circulating, cells maintained) accounts for about 60-70% of total daily energy expenditure. Add the thermic effect of food on top and you're at roughly 70-80% of your energy budget spent before you even stand up from bed [1]. Physical activity - including your 100km rides - typically makes up the remaining 20-30%, though obviously that range is wide and shifts dramatically for endurance athletes.So yes, of course people who cycle 100km need more fuel. Nobody is disputing that. My point is that most people vastly overestimate how many calories exercise burns relative to what their body spends just existing, and they use kcal as a universal unit of nutritional value when the body's actual energy extraction varies significantly by macronutrient composition. People optimizing purely on calorie numbers are working with a model that's far rougher than they think.And this whole picture gets worse with wearables pushing calorie counts front and center. You see it all the time - "my wearable shows that i burned 300 kcal with that activity so it zero outs that sweet thing I ate earlier that was also 300 kcal" That's wrong on multiple levels - the device estimate is inaccurate to begin with, the thermic processing of that pastry isn't equivalent to the "300 kcal" on its label, and your body doesn't do neat arithmetic like that anyway. But with every fitness app and smartwatch plastering a big kcal number on your workout summary, it's becoming the default way people think about food and exercise, and it's reinforcing exactly the wrong mental model.[1]: https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/basal-metabolic-r...

That specific aspect might end up irrelevant for dieting, which is exciting since it flies in the face of intuition. It seems that when it comes to long-term modes of existence (as opposed to, say, the one day of the marathon) the "activity level" doesn't really affect how much energy your body uses.>  In this study, we used the doubly-labeled water method to measure total daily energy expenditure (kCal/day) in Hadza hunter-gatherers to test whether foragers expend more energy each day than their Western counterparts. As expected, physical activity level, PAL, was greater among Hadza foragers than among Westerners. Nonetheless, average daily energy expenditure of traditional Hadza foragers was no different than that of Westerners after controlling for body size.https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal...

If you're exercising to lose weight, you're probably thinking that more exercise means more weight loss, which means that you could be overtraining.I recently got a second Apple Watch to wear to bed to track my sleep, and it's given me some really great insights into when I'm hitting the red zone and need to dial back training. For exercise, more intensity is not always better. What matters is consistency, not consistently high intensity.

No you dont. Exercise does help, and has many other benefits but is not the main driving factor for losing weight. Diet is by far the most important one. Calories intake vs expenditure is the only thing you need to worry about if your primary goal is weight loss.

This doesn't mean you aren't over training.If it's strength training... Without knowing the specifics what you are describing sounds like too much volume (and training for hypertrophy). Lower reps (3-5) & higher weight will have more of a strength stimulus and be less taxing.If it's cardio... you probably should be at a lower intensity and going for longer.

Lower reps (3-5) & higher weight will have more of a strength stimulus and be less taxing.If it's cardio... you probably should be at a lower intensity and going for longer.

This is stupid. All you need to do is to get used to being hungry to the point of losing 0.1kg/day and measure yourself a lot (I'm doing the same).Actually for me working out increases my appetite, and I feel like I have to eat so thar the gym session doesn't go wasted.

The website owner didn't even bother to check for hallucinated links, though https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysio... does exist and somewhat backs up the clickbait headline, so it would be satisfying comeuppance if the mods could just replace the submission accordingly.

I'm worrying that soon, I will have to hunt for non-AI essays by them just being worse written/more 'crude' and not as eloquently written as an AI would do :-/
Basically, seeking out "authentic human slop".

For the record, an AI detector that appears to have put work into reliability and that I trust very much from my own testing, Pangram (https://www.pangram.com), says this is 100% AI generated. I've used it plenty before when experimenting with AI-collab writing, both fiction and non-fiction, and it's frustratingly accurate in identifying what is and isn't my contribution. I have since largely given up trying to do AI-collab writing, because no matter how nice the writing looks in the moment, it always reeks when read closely, or on later days.

"Here is one paragraph of an idea, an abstract of a report.  Write a blog post."Whereas a "history of fire" contains no article in the prompt and so might have more material from its own auto complete database to draw from.

Granted, you don't like to like this style of writing, I don't either. But you don't have to auto-accuse AI writing either. Also, there's nothing wrong with using AI to rephrase a manually written text for better readability, plenty of people use AI for that too rather than writing the entire thing.

I can see why every vegetarian should take it. But if you eat meat regularly, your creatine stores will be at a level where you'd probably only see a cognitive benefit at times of sleep deprivation. But if you're regularly sleep-deprived, then you'd do best by addressing your sleep issues.

Rhonda Patrick has made several YouTube videos about creatine and you can find more information about creatine at her website - https://www.foundmyfitness.com/topics/creatine.One of her creatine videos mentions that your muscles will take up ingested creatine faster than the brain. So for any creatine to make its way to the brain, your muscular creatine stores must be topped up first.I think dosage would depend on the amount of daily physical activity. If you work out a lot, you'd have to replenish your muscular creatine stores before the brain could access any/much.She also mentions boosting creatine dosage after bouts of mental exertion.

Most of the computation and learning that occurs is attributable to the relative timing of spiking events. A lot of information can be encoded in the delay between 2 spikes. The advantage of biology is that there is no explicit quantization of the time domain that must occur. Biology gets to do a lot of things "for free". Simulating causality in a computer in a similar way requires a priority queue and runs like ass by comparison.

We end up using 100W (2000kcal/day) for the whole body, or about 20W for the nervous system alone (though a nervous system alone wouldn't be able to survive). That's comparable to what a modern laptop uses. Sure, that laptop can't run a large LLM at any reasonable speed, but it can do basic math far better than my brain. By a comically large margin. Just a consequence of the very different architectures chosen

You don't suffer from a lack of time, but rather a lack of energy.
And actually, you don't suffer from a lack of energy, but a lack of activation energy.We colloquially refer to activation energy as motivation. But maybe that's not the whole story. Some of it is willpower and personality, but maybe some of it is a buildup of adenosine.This squares with my personal experience. It's harder to start things after day's worth of intense mental effort.

The Jackson Laboratory–New York Stem Cell Foundation Collaborative (JAX-NYSCF) today announced a five-year strategic research collaboration with GSK focused on advancing human cellular models of neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer's disease.

The collaboration reflects a strategic focus that brings together human stem cell research, advanced data science tools, and large-scale research systems to help close a long-standing gap between scientific discovery and the development of new medicines. The goal is to generate disease-relevant cellular models that enable the scientific community to interrogate the underlying human biology of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and accelerate the translation of those insights into potential therapies.

"This collaboration is a concrete example of where early stage biomedical research is heading," said Lon Cardon, president and CEO of JAX, which recently expanded its discovery platform with the acquisition of NYSCF. "Now we have the opportunity to extend those discoveries -and accelerate therapies to patients-by bridging traditional disease models with next-generation patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models that more accurately capture the complexity of human biology at scale."

By integrating GSK's deep knowledge of neurodegeneration, translational science and drug discovery with JAX-NYSCF's pioneering stem cell technology and expertise, access to relevant patient cohorts, and automation platform, the partners aim to build more predictive models of neurodegenerative diseases for identifying and prioritizing promising drug candidates.

Establishing a translational biology and scientific discovery collaboration with JAX-NYSCF complements the work we are doing at GSK on cellular models of disease, and offers the potential to yield new insights that may help accelerate therapeutic discovery for devastating neurodegenerative diseases, building on our established expertise in immunology and inflammation. By working together with JAX-NYSCF, we have an opportunity to develop more predictive models and ultimately, to use that better understanding to develop potential new medicines and determine which patients are most likely to benefit from new therapies."

A new systematic review and meta-analysis published in Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery, the official journal of the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF), reveals that musicians face substantially higher rates of tinnitus, hearing loss, and hyperacusis compared to non-musicians. The study, which pooled data from 67 studies encompassing more than 28,000 musicians across 21 countries.

The research found that 42.6% of musicians reported tinnitus (ringing in the ears), compared to just 13.2% in control populations. Hearing loss affected 25.7% of musicians versus 11.6% of controls, and hyperacusis - an increased sensitivity to everyday sounds - was reported by 37.3% of musicians compared to 15.3% of non-musicians.

Many musicians quietly live with ringing ears, sound sensitivity, or hearing loss, no matter whether they play in a symphony hall or a small club. Yet the research we have is still imperfect, often based on self-reported symptoms and missing details about things like other loud hobbies, specific instruments, and how consistently people use hearing protection. What we really need now is more personal, musician-entered risk profiling so we can offer practical, tailored advice that helps artists protect their hearing without sacrificing the music they love."

Shaun A. Nguyen, MD, Professor, Department of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery, Medical University of South Carolina

Among musicians who experienced tinnitus, the majority (76.3%) described their symptoms as occasional, while 15.6% reported permanent tinnitus. Among musicians with hearing loss, approximately 63% of cases were based on subjective self-report, with only about 37% confirmed through objective audiometric testing - suggesting the true prevalence may be even higher than reported.

Notably, the study found no significant difference in the prevalence of hearing loss, hyperacusis, or tinnitus between classical and pop/rock musicians. This challenges previous assumptions and suggests that auditory risk extends across musical genres. The authors note that individual factors such as instrument type, seating position within an ensemble, room acoustics, and attitudes toward hearing protection may play a more critical role in auditory risk than genre alone.

Insilico Medicine ("Insilico", 3696.HK), a clinical-stage generative artificial intelligence (AI)-driven drug discovery company, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) have entered into a collaborative research agreement aimed at discovering new therapeutic targets for gastroesophageal malignancies. The initiative builds on MSK's global leadership in this field under the direction of Yelena Y. Janjigian, MD, Carroll and Milton Petrie Chair; Chief, GI Oncology; and Founding Director of the MSK GEC Therapeutics Accelerator, whose group has delivered multiple practice-changing advances in gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers. Patrick Evans, BS, MBA, Senior Project Manager in the Janjigian Lab, will serve as the MSK project lead, supporting integration of scientific, operational, and translational efforts across teams.

Insilico Medicine's multidisciplinary team will utilize its PandaOmics platform and other proprietary tools to accelerate the discovery of new disease mechanisms and target hypotheses. PandaOmics is an AI-driven biological data analysis platform developed and designed to accelerate drug target discovery by integrating advanced, multi-dimensional artificial intelligence (AI) and bioinformatics models with multimodal omics and biomedical text data for therapeutic target and biomarker identification. The platform utilizes over 20 proprietary AI and bioinformatic models to systematically prioritize druggable biological targets with high translational potential.

A central strength of the project is the integration of MSK's extensive multi-omic clinical datasets into PandaOmics. MSK contributes high quality patient genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data and deeply annotated clinical cohorts, providing a rich foundation for systematic analysis and identification of disease drivers across diverse GEC subtypes. By combining MSK's world-class clinical and translational expertise with Insilico's AI powered platforms, the joint project teams aim to uncover actionable targets and biological pathways that may lead to future personalized therapeutic options and improved outcomes for patients with gastroesophageal cancers.

The collaboration is currently centered on data gathering, quality control, and integration. Subsequent phases anticipate involving AI driven hypothesis generation, target ranking, and detailed biological investigation. The project also supports the evaluation and advancement of identified targets across a range of therapeutic modalities, including biologics and small molecules.

"This collaboration with MSKbrings together leading clinical oncology expertise with our generative AI platforms," said Alex Zhavoronkov, PhD, Founder and CEO of Insilico Medicine. "Gastroesophageal cancers remain among the most challenging solid tumors. By integrating MSK's exceptional clinical data resources with our target discovery technologies, we aim to identify meaningful biological insights and accelerate the development of new therapeutic options for patients worldwide."

Reflecting on the collaboration, Dr. Janjigian noted: "GEC patients need new breakthroughs, and those breakthroughs must come from a deeper understanding of each patient's unique disease biology. By combining patient-level clinical and molecular data with transformative AI tools, we can accelerate the discovery of clinically meaningful targets and move more personalized therapies toward patients who need them most, in real time and faster."

Harnessing state-of-the-art AI and automation technologies, Insilico has significantly improved the efficiency of preclinical drug development, setting a benchmark for AI-driven drug R&D. While traditional early-stage drug discovery typically requires an average of 4.5 years, Insilico has nominated 20 preclinical candidates from 2021 to 2024, with an average timeline-from project initiation to preclinical candidate (PCC) nomination-of just 12 to 18 months per program, with only 60 to 200 molecules synthesized and tested in each program.

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®) today published new NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) for Pediatric Soft Tissue Sarcomas. This is the 7th NCCN Guidelines® for a pediatric cancer, expanding the overall library to cover 91 topics in cancer care. The guidelines present the latest evidence-based, expert consensus-driven recommendations for nearly every type of cancer plus prevention, screening, survivorship, and supportive care. NCCN Guidelines are updated at least once a year and help cancer care providers worldwide to attain the best possible outcomes.

The new NCCN Guidelines® for Pediatric Soft Tissue Sarcomas is now available for free at NCCN.org. They focus on a subtype called rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) which is the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma in people under 20. RMS represents nearly 5% of all childhood cancers. 

"Most cancers that occur in children are fundamentally different from cancers occurring in adults," explained Stephen Skapek, MD, Duke Cancer Institute, Chair of the NCCN Guidelines Panel for Pediatric Soft Tissue Sarcoma. "RMS can be divided into specific subtypes that are driven by different genetic changes that can influence outcomes. Those changes and other clinical and pathology features are all incorporated into the multi-faceted treatments. That's why it was essential to form a group of leading, multi-disciplinary experts from across the country to put together a roadmap for diagnosing, risk stratifying, and treating these patients."

Children are most likely to be diagnosed with RMS at a very young age, toddlers or early elementary school. When treating someone so young, you are not looking to just prolong survival, the goal is a full cure with minimal side effects and zero recurrence."

Douglas Hawkins, MD, Panel Vice-Chair, Seattle Children's

RMS is tricky to diagnose; it can be located almost anywhere on the body. When it presents in the head, neck, or limb, it can show up as a lump with or without pain. Other times it occurs on an internal organ, which might cause problems for breathing or urination. There are three major risk groups with varying survival rates. The intensity of the treatment, which typically includes chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy, must be tailored to the risk group as well as the age and the patient's developmental stage, which might be influenced by the treatment. The new NCCN Guidelines explain how to provide treatment in a way that balances the goal of cure with the need to minimize acute side effects, such as severe infections, and long-term effects that could bring additional problems at some point in the future.

Fred Hutch Cancer Center scientists reached a crucial milestone in blocking Epstein Barr virus (EBV), a pathogen estimated to infect 95% of the global population that is linked to multiple types of cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and other chronic health conditions.

Using mice with human antibody genes, the research team developed new genetically human monoclonal antibodies that prevent two key antigens on the surface of the virus from binding to and entering human immune cells. Published in Cell Reports Medicine, the study highlights one of the newly identified monoclonal antibodies that successfully blocked infection in mice with human immune systems when they were challenged with EBV.

Finding human antibodies that block Epstein Barr virus from infecting our immune cells has been particularly challenging because, unlike other viruses, EBV finds a way to bind to nearly every one of our B cells. We decided to use new technologies to try to fill this knowledge gap and we ended up taking a critical step toward blocking one of the world's most common viruses."

Andrew McGuire, PhD, biochemist and cellular biologist in the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division at Fred Hutch

A key challenge in the study was to pursue human monoclonal antibodies that could successfully halt EBV infection without triggering an anti-drug response to the antibodies themselves, a common response among patients treated with antibodies raised in other animals. The researchers targeted two antigens, gp350, which helps EBV bind to cell receptors, and gp42, which allows EBV to enter and infect human cells through a process called fusion. Using an innovative mouse model carrying human antibody genes, the effort yielded two monoclonal antibodies against gp350 and eight against gp42.

"Not only did we identify important antibodies against Epstein Barr virus, but we also validated an innovative a new approach for discovering protective antibodies against other pathogens," noted Crystal Chhan, a pathobiology PhD student in the McGuire Lab. "As an early-career scientist, it was an exciting finding and has helped me appreciate how science often leads to unexpected discoveries."

With help from Fred Hutch's Antibody Tech Core, further analysis found sites of vulnerability that could be useful in future vaccine development. In the final step of the study, the research team discovered that one of the monoclonal antibodies against gp42 successfully prevented infection of EBV. Another monoclonal antibody against gp350 provided partial protection.

More than 128,000 people in the U.S. undergo solid organ and bone marrow transplant annually. However, there are no specific therapies to prevent EBV from infecting or reactivating in patients undergoing immunosuppression for transplant procedures. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) are an aggressive and sometimes life-threatening lymphoma that can develop after immune suppression and is most often caused by unchecked EBV infection.

"Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD), most of which are EBV-associated lymphomas, are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality after organ transplantation," noted Rachel Bender Ignacio, MD, MPH, an associate professor and infectious disease physician at Fred Hutch and University of Washington School of Medicine. "Preventing EBV viremia has strong potential to reduce the incidence of PTLD and limit the need to reduce immunosuppression, thereby helping preserve graft function while improving overall patient outcomes. Effective prevention of EBV viremia remains a significant unmet need in transplant medicine."

Transplant recipients may experience infection if their donor was exposed to EBV and passed on latent virus through the donor cells, or for transplant patients who already have had EBV infection, immunosuppression may cause latent virus in their bodies to replicate unchecked. Children undergoing immunosuppression for transplant could especially benefit from a specific therapy to prevent EBV, as a higher proportion of children have not yet been exposed to EBV.

The scientists envision a future therapy in which an infusion of these monoclonal antibodies could prevent PTLD by blocking EBV infection and activation in the patient populations who face the highest risk of EBV-related complications.

Fred Hutch has filed for intellectual property rights covering monoclonal antibodies identified in the study, and McGuire and Chhan are working with scientific collaborators and an industry partner to advance a potential therapy for immunocompromised patients. A potential therapy could be tested for safety in healthy adult volunteers and, if acceptable, proceed to clinical trials in the relevant patient population.

"There's momentum to advance our discovery to a therapy that would make a huge difference for patients undergoing transplant," said McGuire. "After many years of searching for a viable way to protect against Epstein Barr virus, this is a significant stride for the scientific community and the people at the highest risk of complications from this virus."

Harlequin ichthyosis (HI) is a rare, severe genetic skin disorder caused by ABCA12 mutations, leading to defective lipid transport and loss of skin barrier function. Infants present with thick, armor-like plates, deep fissures, ectropion, and eclabium, with high risks of dehydration, infection, and respiratory failure. Historically fatal, survival has improved with neonatal intensive care and systemic retinoids. This review covers pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, management, genetic counseling, and emerging gene-based therapies.

HI is the most severe form of congenital ichthyosis. Newborns are encased in rigid hyperkeratotic scales that compromise barrier function, leading to life-threatening complications. Recent advances in neonatal care and retinoid therapy have enabled long-term survival, and the genetic basis-ABCA12 mutations disrupting epidermal lipid transport-is now well established.

ABCA12 encodes a lipid transporter in keratinocyte lamellar granules. In HI, loss-of-function mutations prevent glucosylceramide transport, impairing formation of the stratum corneum lipid barrier. This triggers compensatory keratinocyte hyperproliferation, massive keratin accumulation, and retention of corneocytes. The resulting rigid plates restrict chest expansion, while fissures permit fluid loss and pathogen entry.

Newborns display pathognomonic thick, yellow-white plates separated by deep erythematous fissures, severe ectropion, eclabium, flattened ears/nose, and joint contractures. Complications include respiratory distress, feeding failure, dehydration, temperature instability, and sepsis. Long-term, survivors face persistent hyperkeratosis, scarring, ocular issues, and psychosocial burden.

Prenatal diagnosis via CVS or amniocentesis detects ABCA12 mutations in at-risk families. Postnatal diagnosis is clinical, confirmed by genetic testing to distinguish HI from other ichthyoses.

Neonatal care focuses on fluid balance, infection prevention, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Systemic retinoids (oral acitretin) initiated early are disease-modifying, accelerating scale shedding and improving pliability. Daily emollients, keratolytics, and wound care are essential. Ophthalmologic lubrication and surgical correction address ectropion; physical therapy manages contractures. Psychosocial support is critical.

Historically fatal, survival now extends into adulthood with aggressive care. Quality of life varies; long-term retinoid use requires monitoring for hepatotoxicity and skeletal effects. Chronic skin fragility and social integration remain challenges.

HI is autosomal recessive; carrier parents have 25% recurrence risk. Reproductive options include prenatal diagnosis and preimplantation genetic testing. Counseling provides recurrence risk assessment and emotional support for informed decision-making.

Gene therapy and CRISPR-Cas9 correction of ABCA12 in patient-derived cells are under investigation. Stem cell-based approaches using gene-corrected induced pluripotent stem cells for autologous skin equivalents show promise. Novel pharmacologies targeting alternative lipid pathways and nanotechnology-based topical delivery are early in development. International registries and standardized outcomes are urgently needed.

HI has transformed from a universally fatal neonatal condition to a chronic, manageable disease. Advances in neonatal care, retinoids, and multidisciplinary support have improved survival and quality of life. Genetic counseling empowers families, and emerging gene-based therapies offer hope for definitive correction. Continued research and equitable access to care remain essential.

The way we understand the movement of our own bodies plays an important role when learning physical skills, from sports to dancing. But a new study finds this phenomenon works very differently for people learning to use robotic prosthetic devices.

"When people first start walking with a prosthetic leg, they think their bodies are moving more awkwardly than they really are," says Helen Huang, corresponding author of a paper on the work. "With practice, as their performance improves, people still do a poor job of assessing how their bodies move, but they are inaccurate in a very different way.

"This is the first study to look at this phenomenon in people using lower-limb robotic prosthetics, and it raises a number of questions that should help us improve people's ability to walk with these devices," says Huang, who is the Jackson Family Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering in the Lampe Joint Department of Biomedical Engineering at North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Everyone has a personal body image – an understanding of how their body is structured, how it moves, and so on. And this understanding of our bodies informs the way we move. When learning a new physical skill, such as dancing, we have a mental image of how our bodies are moving – but that's often not the way our bodies are actually moving. Over time our mental image of how our body moves more closely aligns with our actual movements, and our physical performance improves.

We wanted to learn more about how and whether people who are using robotic prosthetics incorporate that prosthetic device into their body image. Does that change as people become more familiar with using these devices? Is there any relationship between incorporating these devices into one's body image and their performance using these devices?"

Helen Huang, corresponding author

For this study, the researchers recruited nine able-bodied study participants. Over the course of four days, study participants were tasked with walking using a robotic prosthetic attached to a knee bent at a right angle. Specifically, they were asked to walk on a treadmill as quickly as possible without touching handrails.

Participants practiced using the prosthetic device each day. After each practice, participants were shown a computer animation that displayed a range of different biomechanical walking gaits, and were asked to select which gait was closest to their recent performance using the prosthesis.

"Initially, participants felt their gait was more off-balance and stilted than it actually was," Huang says. "By the end of the four-day study, participants felt their gait was more fluid and natural than it actually was. The performance of all participants did improve significantly over those four days. However, the participants were all still inaccurate at assessing the way their own bodies moved – just in a more confident way."

The researchers found that one of the things study participants were focused on when assessing their own gait was the position of their torso. The participants did not place much emphasis on the behavior of the prosthetic device itself.

"One reason for this is likely because they are receiving very little direct feedback about the behavior of the device – they can't see themselves moving," Huang says. "This raises the possibility of improving performance by giving people visual or other feedback they can use to calibrate their body image and gait while training with the prosthetic device.

"It will also be important to address the overconfidence people have in their own movement skills," Huang says. "If you already think you're doing great, you're less likely to put in the work necessary to get better – even if there is significant room for improvement. We think it would be valuable to find a way to give people a more accurate assessment of how their body is really moving."

The paper, "Projecting the New Body: How Body Image Evolves During Learning to Walk with a Wearable Robot," will be published February 17 in the open access journal PNAS Nexus. First author of the paper is I-Chieh Lee, a former research assistant professor in the Lampe Joint Department. The paper was co-authored by Huan Min, a Ph.D. student at NC State, and by Ming Liu, a research associate professor in the Lampe Joint Department.

This work was done with support from the National Institutes of Health under grant R01HD110519; and from the National Science Foundation under grant 2211739.

Escalation of treatment through systemic therapy intensification, targeted agents, or combination regimens might improve cure rates in biologically aggressive early breast cancer. Conversely, de-escalation strategies are being studied to minimize toxicity, overtreatment, and long-term side effects in patients with lower-risk or highly responsive tumors in patients with early-stage disease. 

In early-stage, HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, genomic profiling tools can determine whether chemotherapy or extended endocrine therapy adds meaningful benefit. Patients with low recurrence scores tend to have a low risk for distant relapse and excellent outcomes; therapy can often be de-escalated to endocrine therapy alone. In low-risk HR-positive, HER2-negative disease with a low genomic score, adjuvant chemotherapy typically adds limited benefit while increasing toxicity. Further, CDK 4/6 inhibitors are typically not indicated in this low-risk setting.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is generally reserved for locally advanced disease, node-positive or inoperable disease, or when downstaging is needed.

Platinum-based regimens are generally not standard for the routine treatment of stage IA HR-positive, HER2-negative disease.

In TNBC, achieving pCR after neoadjuvant therapy is strongly associated with favorable overall survival and event-free survival. Contemporary response-adapted strategies tend to focus escalation on patients with residual disease while exploring de-escalation for complete responders. Given these results, experts suggest that treatment de-escalation can be considered for patients with TNBC who achieved complete pCR. However, this is based on individual patients; if certain treatment regimens are planned, it is advised to proceed accordingly. Further, duration-shortening or omission strategies are still under investigation.

ctDNA in early breast cancer is promising but still in the analytical and clinical validation stage, with clinical decision-making applications generally trial-based rather than standard.

Learn more about neoadjuvant therapies for breast cancer.

In low-risk, node-negative, HER2-positive disease, an approach using a limited duration of taxane-based chemotherapy paired with single-agent anti-HER2 therapy (followed by completion of anti‑HER2 therapy) has demonstrated excellent long-term disease control in prospective studies. This strategy intentionally avoids anthracyclines and other intensive multi-agent regimens to reduce treatment burden without compromising patient outcomes in appropriately selected patients.

Anthracycline-containing, dual anti-HER2 regimens are typically reserved for higher-risk disease.

More intensive multi-agent chemotherapy with dual anti-HER2 blockade is generally used for higher-risk presentations and represents escalation rather than de-escalation for this group.

Anti-HER2 therapy alone is generally not considered an adequately validated approach for most patients in this risk category outside of specific circumstances (eg, comorbidity or chemotherapy contraindication) or clinical trials.

Learn more about chemotherapy for breast cancer.

Patients with high recurrence scores or multiple involved nodes remain at substantial risk of recurrence despite endocrine therapy. For these patients, escalation is an evidence-based option. These approaches target micrometastatic residual disease, improving disease-free survival in higher-risk subgroups identified by biology and stage rather than demographics alone.

Menopausal status can influence the type of endocrine therapy, but it alone is not a reliable driver of escalation beyond endocrine therapy. Age by itself is not a primary escalation trigger as well.

Family history affects genetics or risk of developing cancer and might prompt genetic testing, enhanced screening, and consideration of risk-reducing surgery, but it does not directly escalate systemic therapy for an already-diagnosed early HR-positive tumor in the way nodal burden does.

For patients with early-stage breast cancer, partial-breast irradiation is a recommended de-escalation option following lumpectomy. This method has proven equivalent to whole-breast radiation in preventing local recurrence, with reduced treatment time and toxicity. Data have shown that individualized radiotherapy de-escalation (whether by limiting volume, dose, or duration) can preserve excellent local control.

Radiotherapy omission is only considered in narrowly defined populations, often older patients with very favorable tumor biology.

Bilateral mastectomy is generally not a de-escalation strategy for locoregional management of a low-risk, unilateral cancer.

Nucleotide synthesis-the production of the basic components of DNA and RNA-is essential for cell growth and division. In most animal cells, this process depends closely on properly functioning mitochondria, the organelles responsible for respiration and energy production. When mitochondrial respiration fails-a common feature of mitochondrial diseases and several forms of cancer-cells lose the ability to proliferate normally. A new study published in Nature Metabolism now shows that this dependence is not irreversible.

An international team led by José Antonio Enríquez of the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III (CNIC) and the Spanish network for research into frailty and healthy aging (CIBERFES) has experimentally uncoupled nucleotide synthesis from mitochondrial activity using ScURA, a yeast-derived genetic tool now available to the research community that will enable new explorations of cellular metabolism.

The study, which also involved scientists at the University of Cologne (Germany), the University of Valladolid (UVa), and the CSIC–UVa Institute of Biology and Molecular Genetics, sheds new light on the role of mitochondria in rare diseases and cancer.

In complex organisms such as humans, respiration is essential for generating the energy required for life, with the mitochondria in our cells using oxygen to sustain vital cellular processes. By contrast, some organisms-such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae-can survive without oxygen and have evolved alternative metabolic pathways to produce the molecular building blocks required for RNA and DNA synthesis.

Building on this observation, the team identified a yeast enzyme that can sustain nucleotide synthesis independently of mitochondrial respiration. Instead of oxygen, this enzyme uses fumarate, a metabolite derived from nutrients. The team extracted the gene encoding this enzyme, called ScURA, from yeast and inserted it into human cells.

Unlike cells from healthy individuals, the patient-derived cells used in the study cannot grow in standard laboratory conditions because they require extra supplementation with nutrients and DNA precursors. When CNIC researchers introduced ScURA into these diseased cells, they found that the cells were able to grow under normal conditions, just like cells from healthy individuals. "Thanks to the yeast gene, the cells 'learned' to build DNA in a new way," explain the authors.

The results were striking: human cells expressing ScURA continued to produce DNA and RNA even when the mitochondrial respiratory chain was blocked. Unlike the equivalent human enzyme, which is physically linked to the mitochondria, the yeast version works in the cytosol and uses an alternative metabolic pathway.

The team also discovered that ScURA helped cells use their nutrients more efficiently without disrupting other essential cellular functions-an important first step toward the more ambitious goal of improving the lives of people with mitochondrial disorders.

Mitochondria not only produce energy; they also shape fundamental processes such as DNA synthesis. Our work shows that if we provide a cell with an alternative route to make nucleotides, we can sustain cell proliferation even when mitochondrial respiration fails."

José Antonio Enríquez, lead author, head of the CNIC GENOXPHOS group

One of the study's most important findings is that ScURA-modified cells can grow without uridine supplementation, a common strategy used in laboratories to compensate for mitochondrial defects.

Moreover, the new approach restores cell proliferation across different experimental models of mitochondrial diseases, including those caused by severe mutations in essential respiratory chain complexes. For first author Andrea Curtabbi (CNIC), "this tool allows us, for the first time, to clearly separate the direct effects of mitochondrial dysfunction on nucleotide synthesis from other secondary metabolic changes."

Mitochondrial diseases are severe and often untreatable, and in the laboratory cells with impaired mitochondrial respiration require external supplements to proliferate. However, when the researchers inserted ScURA into these cells, they proliferated under standard conditions in the same way as healthy cells.

The study also shows that this imported enzyme boosts the efficiency of nutrient use without altering other essential cellular functions, making ScURA a highly valuable experimental tool. The authors further highlight its potential for clarifying mitochondrial contributions to rare diseases and cancer. "Identifying which metabolic processes become limiting when mitochondrial respiration fails is crucial for designing precise therapeutic strategies," concludes Enríquez.

In future work, the team plans to expand their findings to other disease models and optimize this approach for preclinical research.

The project was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (projects PID2021-127988OB-I00 and TED2021-131611B-100), the Human Frontier Science Program (RGP0016/2018), the Leducq Foundation (17CVD04), and the Instituto de Salud Carlos III–CIBERFES (CB16/10/00282).

Hospital admissions for maltreatment of children under the age of 2 years declined 31% during the 16-week lockdown at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, returning to prepandemic levels after restrictions lifted, according to new research published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.251317.

However, after the 16-week period of restricted health care access, rates of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for child maltreatment increased by 80%.

"We consider that the observed decrease and subsequent stabilization in hospital admission incidence rate during the pandemic may be attributable to delayed case identification or lack of admissions to investigate more minor injuries, rather than a true decline in the population incidence of child maltreatment - young children experiencing maltreatment that may have warranted hospital admission did not appear to present to care during the period of restricted health care access," writes pediatrician Dr. Matthew Carwana, BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, British Columbia, with coauthors. "This early underdetection, as well as ongoing pandemic-related stress, may have led to the subsequent increase in ICU admissions."

The strict public health measures enacted during the first period of the pandemic disrupted normal routines, closing schools, restricting access to primary care physicians, and increasing household stress and parental isolation. These factors could lead to increased child maltreatment, yet few studies have examined the impact of the pandemic on child maltreatment.

Researchers from POPCORN (Pediatric Outcomes Improvement Through Coordination of Research Networks) compared hospital admissions in the pandemic period from Mar. 1, 2020, to Mar. 25, 2023, with the prepandemic period (Apr. 3, 2016, to Feb. 29, 2020) using data from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) for all provinces and territories except Quebec, and from l'Institut national d'excellence en santé et en services sociaux (INESSS) for Quebec. A total of 1518 hospital admissions for child maltreatment occurred in children younger than 2 years out of about 750 000 children in this age range in the country.

As admissions to ICUs increased after the 16-week period of health care restrictions ended, it may indicate child maltreatment during this phase of the pandemic.

"This raises concern that children may have been living in unsafe situations or experiencing abuse that went undetected during the period of the most stringent public health measures. It also highlights the potential importance of hospital admissions for assessment of sentinel injuries consistent with child maltreatment that could prompt action to prevent more severe presentations," the authors write.

They suggest that, in preparing for potential future pandemics, planners should ensure there are mechanisms to identify cases of child maltreatment, even during periods of public health restrictions.

Bioengineered E. coli bacteria can now produce a group of compounds with anticancer, anti-HIV, antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory activities. The Kobe University achievement is the result of a rational design strategy that yields a platform for the industrial production of drug candidates.

Plants produce many substances with promising pharmacological activities. For example, Rhododendron species produce a class of compounds, called orsellinic acid-derived meroterpenoids, with remarkable anticancer, anti-HIV, antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory activities. However, despite their attractiveness for pharmacological research, their natural origin makes them unreliable and expensive to produce and previous attempts at the microbial production of the core compound, orsellinic acid, have only reached disappointingly low yields.

There are many examples where compounds appear promising in the literature but fail to advance sufficiently in evaluation or applied research due to supply issues. I began to feel this is less an issue with individual compounds and more a structural challenge facing natural products research as a whole."

TOMITA Itsuki, doctoral student, Kobe University 

Tomita works in the group of Kobe University bioengineer HASUNUMA Tomohisa, a team of experts in rationally designing microorganisms, such as the gut bacterium Escherichia coli, for the production of a broad range of compounds. Using a combination of introducing appropriate genes from plants, fungi and bacteria, analyzing the organism's metabolism and optimizing the culture conditions, they set out to create the first production platform for these compounds ready for industrial-scale production based on the widely used bacterium E. coli.

In the journal Metabolic Engineering, the Kobe University bioengineers now publish that they achieved a production of 202 mg orsellinic acid per liter, which represents a 40-fold improvement over the previously reported microbial production. This was not only the highest production level achieved so far, it was also the first time the core compound was produced in E. coli. Tomita, who is the study's first author, says, "It is a significant achievement that we recreated a complex eukaryotic biosynthetic pathway in the bacterium E. coli, something that was previously thought difficult."

In addition, the group also introduced a further gene from Rhododendron that completed the biosynthesis of a pharmacologically relevant compound. As a representative for the class of pharmaceuticals, the Kobe University team chose grifolic acid, a compound known for its potent anticancer and analgesic properties. And while the so-engineered bacteria could successfully produce the target compound, the yield was low and Hasunuma's team acknowledges the need to further optimize the production process. In fact, they have already identified potential bottlenecks to be optimized in future studies.

But the group's aims go far beyond this. Hasunuma explains: "In the short term, the platform established in this study can be immediately applied to the production and evaluation of related compounds and their derivatives. However, the rational design strategy employed here serves as a foundational technology for the production of various complex compounds using E. coli."

This research was funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Program for Forming Japan's Peak Research Universities (J-PEAKS)) and the Japan Science and Technology Agency (grant JPMJGX23B4). It was conducted in collaboration with researchers from the University of Minho and the RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science.

Bacteria have evolved to adapt to all of Earth's most extreme conditions, from scorching heat to temperatures well below zero. Ice caves are just one of the environments hosting a variety of microorganisms that represent a source of genetic diversity that has not yet been studied extensively.

Now, researchers in Romania tested antibiotic resistance profiles of a bacterial strain that until recently was hidden in a 5,000-year-old layer of ice of an underground ice cave – and found it could be an opportunity for developing new strategies to prevent the rise of antibiotic resistance and study how resistance naturally evolves and spreads. They reported their discovery in Frontiers in Microbiology.

The Psychrobacter SC65A.3 bacterial strain isolated from Scarisoara Ice Cave, despite its ancient origin, shows resistance to multiple modern antibiotics and carries over 100 resistance-related genes. But it can also inhibit the growth of several major antibiotic-resistant 'superbugs' and showed important enzymatic activities with important biotechnological potential."

Dr. Cristina Purcarea, author, senior scientist, Institute of Biology Bucharest, Romanian Academy

Psychrobacter SC65A.3 is a strain of the genus Psychrobacter, which are bacteria adapted to cold environments. Some species can cause infections in humans or animals. Psychrobacter bacteria have biotechnological potential, but the antibiotic resistance profiles of these bacteria are largely unknown. "Studying microbes such as Psychrobacter SC65A.3 retrieved from millennia-old cave ice deposits reveals how antibiotic resistance evolved naturally in the environment, long before modern antibiotics were ever used," said Purcarea.

The team drilled a 25-meter ice core from the area of the cave known as the Great Hall, representing a 13,000-year timeline. To avoid contamination, the ice fragments taken from the core were placed in sterile bags and kept frozen on their way back to the lab. There, the researchers isolated various bacterial strains and sequenced their genome to determine which genes allow the strain to survive in low temperatures and which confer antimicrobial resistance and activity.

They tested for resistance of the SC65A strain against 28 antibiotics from 10 classes that are routinely used to or reserved for treating bacterial infections, including antibiotics that have previously been identified to possess resistance genes or mutations that give them the ability to resist drug effects. This way, they could test whether predicted mechanisms translated into measurable resistance. "The 10 antibiotics we found resistance to are widely used in oral and injectable therapies used to treat a range of serious bacterial infections in clinical practice," Purcarea pointed out. Diseases such as tuberculosis, colitis, and UTIs can be treated with some of the antibiotics that the researchers found resistance to, including rifampicin, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin.

SC65A.3 is the first Psychrobacter strain for which resistance to certain antibiotics – including trimethoprim, clindamycin, and metronidazole – was found. Those antibiotics are used to treat UTIs, infections of lungs, skin, or blood, and the reproductive system. SC65A.3's resistance profile suggests that strains capable of surviving in cold environments could act as reservoirs of resistance genes which are specific DNA sequences that help them survive exposure to drugs.

Bacterial strains like the one examined here hold both a threat and a promise. "If melting ice releases these microbes, these genes could spread to modern bacteria, adding to the global challenge of antibiotic resistance," Purcarea said. "On the other hand, they produce unique enzymes and antimicrobial compounds that could inspire new antibiotics, industrial enzymes, and other biotechnological innovations."

In the Psychrobacter SC65A.3 genome, the researchers found almost 600 genes with unknown functions, suggesting a yet untapped source for discovering novel biological mechanisms. Analysis of the genome also revealed 11 genes that are potentially able to kill or stop the growth of other bacteria, fungi, and viruses.

Such potential is becoming ever more important in a world where antibiotic resistance is a growing concern. Going back to ancient genomes and uncovering their potential highlights the important role the natural environment played in the spread and evolution of antibiotic resistance. "These ancient bacteria are essential for science and medicine," Purcarea concluded, "but careful handling and safety measures in the lab are essential to mitigate the risk of uncontrolled spread."

Nuclera, the biotechnology company enabling rapid access to high-quality proteins and leadXpro, a specialist in structure-based drug discovery for membrane proteins, today announced a scientific partnership. The collaboration brings together eProtein Discovery's™ rapid multiplex membrane protein screening with leadXpro's AI/ML-driven construct design and membrane protein expertise to advance structural studies and therapeutic development.

Membrane proteins remain among the most valuable yet difficult to obtain drug targets. These proteins are notoriously challenging to express and purify in sufficient quantity and quality for structural biology and biophysical studies, limiting drug discovery programs even when promising biology is well understood.

Integrating eProtein Discovery's Cell-Free Protein Synthesis multiplex screening technology with leadXpro's AI/ML and biophysical and structural characterization expertise, the partnership will establish an AI-guided, iterative, end-to-end workflow. The workflow will link in silico construct design with rapid, experimental multiplex screening to accelerate and de-risk challenging membrane protein programs, shortening the path to structural and biophysical insights for structure-based drug discovery.

Membrane protein constructs will be screened using Nuclera's eProtein Discovery System with the most promising variants undergoing detailed biophysical characterization and high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination led by leadXpro. Insights from these studies will be integrated into AI/ML models for construct design and stability predictions, improving yields, functionality, and success rates. The partnership will also inform future integration of AI/ML capabilities into Nuclera's product portfolio to embed predictive design into the eProtein Discovery System, and strengthen leadXpro's platform in rapidly producing and characterizing difficult membrane protein targets.

Scientists are under pressure to progress increasingly complex membrane protein programs faster. By partnering with leadXpro, we can pair AI/ML-driven construct design with our rapid multiplex membrane protein screening to provide a truly 'lab-in-loop' workflow. This collaboration is an important step towards embedding AI/ML into Nuclera's system so that researchers can go from sequence to high-value structural and functional insights in a fraction of the time currently required."

Dr Michael Chen, CEO and Co-Founder, Nuclera

Dr Michael Hennig, CEO, leadXpro, commented: "Access to well-optimized membrane protein constructs is critical for producing high-quality proteins that enable biophysical and structural biology studies. Nuclera's eProtein Discovery platform provides a robust, rapid, and reproducible approach to exploring construct space. Combined with our established AI/ML and structural biology expertise, this integration allows us to support better design decisions earlier and accelerate the progression of promising drug candidates."

Recent research reveals that nuclear speckles play a key role in modifying viral messenger RNAs and in their transport out of the nucleus; therefore, nuclear speckles are an important subject of study in understanding viral infections.

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection dramatically remodels the host cell's nuclear structures. Infection leads to the formation of viral replication compartments and to chromatin marginalization to the nuclear periphery. In addition, a joint research by the Universities of Jyväskylä and Bar-Ilan revealed that viral infection also alters the structure of nuclear speckles, which are essential for messenger RNA processing.

- Nuclear speckles are dynamic, membraneless nuclear bodies that primarily function as sites for the storage, assembly, and modification of factors involved in gene expression. Both cellular and viral messenger RNAs are processed in nuclear speckles. The disassembly of nuclear speckles severely limits the export of viral messenger RNAs from the nucleus, explains Research Director Maija Vihinen-Ranta from the University of Jyväskylä.

Altogether, the research indicates that nuclear speckles function as intermediate hubs for the modification of viral messenger RNAs, thereby highlighting their essential role in viral messenger RNA processing and nuclear export pathways. Without them, virus cannot function normally, and infection cannot progress.

- A better understanding of how viruses interact with host cells and exploit their cellular machinery can help us develop new ways to treat and prevent viral diseases, says Vihinen-Ranta.

The study was published in the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) journal and was conducted in cooperation Professor Shav-Tal's research group Bar-Ilan University (Israel).

The research was financed by the National Institute of Health (USA), the Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation, the Academy of Finland, the Erasmus programme of the European Union, and the European Union's Horizon 2020.

New Australian research suggests that foods naturally rich in live microbes may be associated with better metabolic health, offering fresh insight into diet, microbiome interactions, and chronic disease risk.

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrition Research, researchers investigated associations between the intake of foods containing live microbes (LMs) and health indicators in Australians, with a primary aim of developing a database to estimate LM content in Australian foods and beverages and a secondary exploratory aim of examining health associations.

LMs are naturally present in many common foods, including raw vegetables and fruits, fermented foods, and probiotics. Interest in the intake of LM-containing foods has surged in recent years, given their associations with health and disease risk. High consumption of beneficial LMs has been associated with a lower risk of mortality in previous observational studies, particularly analyses of US population cohorts rather than Australian samples. However, most research on dietary LM intake has focused on American populations or specific foods rather than the whole diet.

In the present study, researchers assessed associations between dietary LM intake and health indicators in Australians. First, they developed a database of LM content for common foods and beverages from the Australian Food and Nutrient (AUSNUT) database, relevant to the Australian Eating Survey (AES). Next, food and beverage items were stratified into low, medium, or high LM categories based on the expected prevalence of viable microbes, using previously published methods; microbial levels were estimated indirectly rather than directly measured in individual food samples.

The low category had an estimated microbial count of < 10⁴ colony-forming units per gram (CFU/g); the medium and high categories had counts of 10⁴-10⁷ CFU/g and > 10⁷ CFU/g, respectively. These data were then used in an exploratory cross-sectional analysis to investigate the relationship between estimated dietary LM intake and health indicators. Data from adults recruited in 2019-20 from the Newcastle region of Australia were analyzed.

Participants were aged 18 years or older and had a stable weight over the past two months. Individuals who were trying to conceive, pregnant, or breastfeeding, those taking medications affecting weight, fluid balance, or metabolic rate, and those with food allergies, chronic medical conditions, certain implanted medical devices, claustrophobia, or other protocol-specified exclusions were excluded. Participants reported demographic data and dietary intake using the AES Food Frequency Questionnaire, a validated instrument that may nonetheless overestimate some dietary intakes due to self-reporting.

The following cardiometabolic health indicators were measured: body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting insulin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Estimated inflammatory markers included interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and C-reactive protein (CRP).

Differences in consumption of LM-containing foods by gender, smoking status, and ethnicity were assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney U test. To explore relationships between estimated LM content categories and health indicators, Spearman's rank correlation was first used to assess the direction of association. Subsequently, weighted least-squares (WLS) regression was used, adjusting for relevant covariates, including gender, smoking status, and energy intake, to account for potential confounding; however, residual confounding cannot be excluded in observational analyses.

The team categorized more than 200 food items from the AUSNUT database to create the LM database. About 229 items were classified as having low LM content, including vegetables, cereal-based products, and meat, poultry, and game products. Additionally, 21 items, including fruits, vegetables, and milk products, had medium LM content.

Of the five fermented foods, two were classified as high LM content and three as medium. Given the limited number of high-LM foods, the medium- and high-LM food groups were aggregated (Med/Hi) to improve statistical power, with yogurt remaining the only clearly high-LM food after grouping. The study included 58 adults, predominantly Caucasian (86%) and female (69%), with a mean age of 38.16 years and a BMI of 26.18 kg/m2. Participants reported relatively higher fruit and vegetable intake than typically observed in the broader Australian population.

Participants primarily consumed the low LM food group (mean daily intake, 1,902 g), followed by the medium LM group (253.6 g/day). Males consumed significantly more low-LM foods than females, and non-smokers had significantly higher intake of Med/Hi LM foods than smokers. Consumption of the low-LM food group was positively correlated with BP.

By contrast, intakes of the medium and Med/Hi-LM food groups were positively correlated with HDL-C and negatively correlated with BMI, fasting insulin, body weight, waist circumference, CRP, and IL-6, although inflammatory marker associations did not remain statistically significant after covariate adjustment, and HDL-C associations remained statistically significant in adjusted analyses. WLS regression showed that consumption of the Med/Hi-LM food group was significantly inversely associated with BMI, insulin, and waist circumference, and positively associated with HDL-C. No significant adjusted associations were observed with fasting glucose, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, or TNF-α.

In summary, more frequent intake of foods with high or medium LM content was positively associated with HDL-C and inversely associated with insulin levels, BMI, waist circumference, and body weight in this Australian sample.

Further research is needed to corroborate these findings across larger, diverse populations and to determine whether dietary LM intake is associated with changes in the gut microbiota, particularly given the exploratory cross-sectional design, relatively small sample size, potential dietary reporting bias, and the inability of observational studies to establish causal relationships.

New neuroimaging research shows that when sleep-deprived people lose focus, the brain briefly shifts toward sleep-like physiology, offering fresh insight into why cognitive performance declines without adequate rest.

In a recent study published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, researchers investigated the precise physiological dynamics associated with transient attentional lapses during acute sleep deprivation rather than a broader clinical "brain fog" syndrome often observed during sleep deprivation. The multimodal study leveraged data from 26 healthy adults and found that when sleep-deprived individuals experience lapses in attention, their brains undergo a coordinated shift in physiology involving neural activity, blood flow, and pupil diameter.

Most notably, the study found that these lapses are synchronized with sleep-like large-amplitude low-frequency oscillatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) waves typically seen predominantly during sleep. The study therefore concludes that attention failures are not random errors or neural deficits but reflect coordinated brain–body state changes whose functional role remains uncertain, rather than a demonstrated attempt to activate metabolic waste-clearance systems.

Sleep deprivation, defined as poor-quality or insufficient sleep (7-9 hours for adults), is a pervasive issue in modern society, with clinically documented consequences ranging from reduced cognitive performance to increased risk of accidents.

While decades of research have established a causal relationship between insufficient sleep and "attention failures," defined as moments when an individual fails to respond to an obvious stimulus, the specific neural and physiological mechanisms driving these lapses remain debated.

Recent research has shown that during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, the brain exhibits large, rhythmic waves of CSF flow. Termed colloquially "brain washing," although these oscillations are bidirectional and not established as net waste-clearance flow, these processes are thought to help clear metabolic waste products and have previously been considered incompatible with wakefulness; however, this belief remains scientifically unverified.

The present study hypothesizes that the boundaries between sleep and wakefulness may blur in sleep-deprived subjects, allowing CSF dynamics to disrupt cognition even during apparent wakefulness. It tests this hypothesis through a multimodal study involving 26 healthy adults, with a mean age of 25.6 years.

The study employed a within-subjects design in which each participant was tested twice: once after a full night of rest and once after a night of total sleep deprivation monitored in a laboratory, thereby controlling for inter-participant variation.

Participants were required to perform a Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) during which multiple physiological measurements were recorded. PVTs are standard, validated tasks that require sustained attention and rapid responses to visual or auditory stimuli.

The primary physiological measurements of interest included participants' blood oxygenation, hemodynamics, and CSF flow, measured using fast functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The study also measured electrical brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) and pupil diameter using pupillometry.

Data analyses aimed to generate a second-by-second timeline of the physiological changes in the brain and body that accompany a participant's attention failure.

The study's first major finding was that sleep-deprived participants displayed significantly slower reaction times and more frequent omissions and missed responses than when rested (P < 0.0001).

Analyses of physiological data further revealed that sleep-deprived subjects exhibited sleep-like, large-amplitude, low-frequency oscillatory CSF waves that intruded into wakefulness, rather than sustained directional fluid flow. The power of these fluid waves was statistically similar to that observed during N2 sleep (24.50 dB vs. 24.80 dB).

Approximately two seconds before the documented lapse, the participant's attention abruptly declined. This lapse coincided with pupil constriction and was followed by a large-scale outward pulse of CSF. As the participant regained attention, the pupil dilated, and CSF was observed to flow back into the brain.

Pupil diameter and CSF demonstrated a correlation (r = 0.26). Pupil constriction, indicating low arousal and alertness, coincided with significant changes in brain blood volume. The authors hypothesize that these associations likely reflect a shared neuromodulatory arousal system with vascular mediation rather than a direct causal effect of pupil constriction on CSF movement.

Finally, EEG data obtained during attention lapses showed a substantial reduction in electrical brain activity, particularly in the alpha-beta range (10-25 Hz), which physiologically signals a momentary suppression of cortical excitability, alongside broader spectral changes consistent with transient low-arousal brain states.

Together, these findings suggest that the sleep-deprived brain physiologically mimics a state of "low arousal," usually reserved for sleep. This low-arousal state triggers coupled neurovascular and CSF oscillatory dynamics rather than a demonstrated fluid-clearing process, correlating with a significant drop in cognitive performance.

The present study provides evidence that attentional failures reflect coordinated brain–body state shifts potentially representing an intrinsic sleep-pressure signal rather than merely localized neural glitches, including changes in pupil diameter, vascular dynamics, and CSF pulsations.

The study concludes that these dynamics reflect a central neuromodulatory circuit, potentially involving the noradrenergic system, that modulates both alertness and brain fluid physiology. However, whether these CSF oscillations contribute to the clearance of metabolic waste or to other restorative functions remains unresolved. These findings support public health guidelines that emphasize the importance of sufficient, high-quality sleep.

A major cohort study suggests that consistent adherence to established healthy eating patterns may add years to life, even after accounting for genetic predisposition.

In a recent study published in Science Advances, researchers investigated the impact of adherence to five established healthy dietary patterns on life expectancy and mortality, examining whether these associations differed by genetic predisposition to longevity rather than susceptibility to shorter lifespan. Greater adherence to all five dietary patterns was linked to lower mortality and longer life expectancy. These benefits were associated with dietary adherence regardless of genetic predisposition to longevity.

Life expectancy growth has begun to stagnate despite decades of improvement, highlighting the need for effective strategies to reduce premature mortality. Unhealthy diets are a leading global cause of death, making dietary modification a cost-effective and scalable intervention.

Rather than focusing on individual nutrients, contemporary research emphasizes overall dietary patterns, which better capture antagonistic or synergistic effects among foods. Several a priori dietary indices, such as the Diabetes Risk Reduction Diet (DDRD), Alternate Mediterranean Diet (AMED), Alternate Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and healthful Plant-based Diet Index (hPDI), have been associated with lower risks of mortality and multiple chronic diseases.

However, relatively few analyses have translated these associations into absolute measures such as life expectancy, which are more relevant for public health messaging and policy decisions than relative risk estimates. Additionally, genetic factors contribute to longevity, and emerging evidence suggests interactions between genetic predisposition and lifestyle exposures, including diet. Yet, the combined effects of dietary quality and genetic predisposition to longevity on life expectancy remain unclear.

This prospective cohort study used data from the UK Biobank, which recruited over 500,000 adults aged 40–69 years between 2006 and 2010 across the United Kingdom. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated 24-hour recall questionnaire administered on up to five occasions between 2009 and 2012. Participants completing at least two dietary assessments and free from cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline were included (n = 103,649). Those with implausible energy intake were excluded.

Five dietary pattern scores were calculated: AHEI-2010, AMED, hPDI, DASH, and DRRD, using predefined scoring systems that reflect adherence to healthy eating principles. Average intake across assessments was used. Covariates included demographic factors, socioeconomic status, smoking, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), energy intake, alcohol consumption, with additional alcohol adjustment applied specifically to dietary scores that did not include alcohol components, and baseline chronic conditions.

Mortality data were obtained from national registries through November 2022. Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause and cause-specific mortality across quintiles of dietary scores. Life expectancy at age 45 was estimated using life-table methods that integrated UK population mortality rates and adjusted HRs; these estimates were model-derived rather than directly observed survival differences. A polygenic risk score (PRS) for longevity was used to assess gene–diet interactions. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test robustness across multiple assumptions and subgroups.

Over a median follow-up of 10.6 years, resulting in 1,094,467 person-years, 4,314 deaths occurred. Higher adherence to all five dietary patterns was correlated with lower all-cause mortality after multivariable adjustment. When the highest and lowest quintiles were compared, adjusted HRs ranged from 0.76 (DDRD) to 0.82 (hPDI), indicating an 18–24% lower risk of death. Significant inverse associations were also observed for several cause-specific outcomes, particularly cancer, respiratory, and other-cause mortality.

Life expectancy analyses showed meaningful absolute differences. At age 45, men in the highest versus lowest quintile gained 1.9 to 3.0 years of life, while women gained 1.5 to 2.3 years. The largest gain for men was observed with DDRD, whereas AMED showed the longest gain for women.

Higher longevity PRS was independently associated with lower mortality, 15% lower risk in the highest versus the lowest tertile. Joint analyses indicated that individuals with both high PRS and high dietary scores had the greatest life expectancy. However, no significant additive or multiplicative interactions were detected for most dietary scores, suggesting that healthy dietary patterns are associated with survival benefits regardless of genetic predisposition. An exception was DDRD, which showed a stronger inverse association with mortality among individuals with lower longevity PRS. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of findings across multiple adjustments and restrictions.

This large prospective study demonstrated that greater adherence to five healthy dietary patterns is consistently associated with reduced mortality and extended life expectancy, independent of genetic predisposition to longevity. Absolute gains of up to three additional years at age 45 underscore the public health relevance of sustained dietary quality. DDRD showed slightly stronger associations, although the study did not directly test biological mechanisms and proposed explanations, such as improved glycemic control, remain speculative.

Strengths include a large sample size, repeated dietary assessments, comprehensive adjustment for confounders, integration of genetic data, and the use of life-table methods to estimate absolute life-expectancy differences. However, limitations include reliance on 24-hour recalls, potential residual confounding, limited ethnic diversity in genetic analyses, and possible overestimation of genetic effects due to sample overlap. Dietary changes over time were not fully captured. In addition, UK Biobank participants may not fully represent the general population, which could affect the generalizability of the findings.

In conclusion, adherence to established healthy dietary patterns is associated with longer life expectancy, regardless of genetic predisposition to longevity. These findings support public health recommendations promoting high-quality diets as a flexible and accessible strategy for extending life span, while recognizing that observational studies cannot establish causality and should be interpreted accordingly.

Our soccer expert offers his Benfica vs Real Madrid predictions, ahead of Tuesday's Champions League clash, at 3:00pm ET (2/17).

Our betting expert expects a relatively open game, with the Portuguese side capable of upsetting Los Blancos once more.

All odds are courtesy of bet365, correct at the time of publishing and subject to change.

Benfica's victory three weeks ago was no fluke. They were the superior side in that match against a shaky Real Madrid, who only needed a draw.

The hosts created eight big chances and generated 3.01 xG across the 90 minutes. Real Madrid finished with an xG total of 1.51, despite dominating possession.

Benfica exploited their opponents' problems at right-back, with left winger Andreas Schjelderup scoring twice. Since then, Alvaro Arbeloa has opted to move Fede Valverde back into midfield. However, neither Dani Carvajal nor Trent Alexander-Arnold has managed to build up much match fitness following recent injuries.

Jude Bellingham and Eder Militao are out injured, while Kylian Mbappe has not trained fully in the week before this game. Those issues point to another potentially tricky night for the visitors. Backing Benfica to win or draw carries an implied probability of 53.5%.

Raul Asencio's late red card in the last meeting rules him out for Tuesday. The youngster has been one of the more reliable Real Madrid defenders in recent months.

While the Spanish giants tend to keep it tight in La Liga, it has been a different story in Europe. Against more attack-minded opponents, Real Madrid conceded 1.5 goals per game in the UCL league phase. They also allowed 13.0 xG in total, which was the 14th-worst record.

Aside from long-term absentee Dodi Lukebakio, Benfica's attack should be at full strength. Schjelderup should cause problems again, while Vangelis Pavlidis has been prolific in Portugal this term. He has also registered two goals and two assists in the Champions League.

Backing the hosts to score over 1.5 goals offers value, with an implied probability of 41.7%.

The recent encounter was goalless until the 30th minute, but exploded into life after that. There has also been a clear overall trend of late goals since Alvaro Arbeloa took charge of Real Madrid.

The first four Los Blancos matches under Arbeloa's guidance all served up more goals in the second half than the first. The Benfica game broke that run, with three goals either side of the break. However, the pattern resumed in league games against Rayo Vallecano and Valencia.

Benfica conceded eight times after the break in the UCL league phase. That was twice as many goals as they let in during the first half.

Mourinho is unlikely to take unnecessary risks from the first whistle here. However, he knows that Benfica need to make home advantage count, so the match should eventually open up. Backing the second half to serve up the most goals looks like the smart bet.

Benfica beat Real Madrid 4-2 on the final matchday in the league phase last month. Goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin scored a dramatic fourth goal in stoppage time and sealed progress for Jose Mourinho's team.

That result also denied Real Madrid direct passage into the round of 16. They must now negotiate a two-legged play-off tie against the same opposition.

Since that remarkable night, Benfica have lost further ground in the Portuguese title race after only drawing with Tondela. Meanwhile, Real Madrid bounced back from that setback with league wins over Rayo Vallecano and Valencia.

Benfica expected lineup: Trubin, Dahl, T. Araujo, Otamendi, Dedic, Barreiro, Aursnes, Schjelderup, Sudakov, Prestianni, Pavlidis

Real Madrid expected lineup: Courtois, Carreras, Huijsen, Rudiger, Alexander-Arnold, Camavinga, Tchouameni, Valverde, Guler, Vinicius, Mbappe

Landon Donovan and Tim Howard expound on the possibility of Christian Pulisic returning to the English Premier League.

With American soccer star Christian Pulisic still awaiting a long-term contract offer from his current club, AC Milan, speculation over a possible return to the English Premier League – widely considered the world's top domestic league – has started to build.  Pulisic's current deal runs through the end of the 2026-2027 season with a team option for '27-'28.  And while Pulisic could remain on that current deal, Milan would risk losing him for an undervalued fee should he push for a move.

Earlier in his career, Pulisic spent 4 seasons with Premier League giants, Chelsea FC, to some mixed results.  While playing an important role in their run to winning the 2021 UEFA Champions League, he also failed to start more than 20 Premier League games in any individual season going progressively downward from 19 his first year to just 8 in his final year.

On the latest episode of Unfiltered Soccer hosted by Tim Howard and Landon Donovan, the two U.S. legends discussed whether a move back to England would be wise for the Hershey-born attacker.



“I remember Kevin De Bruyne at Chelsea. I remember Mo Salah at Chelsea,” said Howard in comparing Pulisic to two players that similarly came to the Premier League early in their careers, struggled, left and eventually returned, becoming two of the greatest players the league has ever seen.

“I sort of feel like that with Christian Pulisic as well,” continued Howard.  “I backed him to the hills at Chelsea. Unfortunately, he didn't get the rub of the green, went through some different coaches, and then he went off. But he sort of reminds me of Mo Salah and Kevin De Bruyne in that he now went off; he's matured, and he's older, and he's now gone and carried a league. He's carried one of the best teams in the league, right? He's put AC Milan on his back.”

For Donovan, questions about Pulisic making the leap from Italy's Serie A to the English Premier League have nothing to do with talent but rather durability.

“This is a scenario where I think if he is motivated and wants to go prove it, he is capable of it – going to one of these big clubs in England.  And he is capable of doing it.  The one hesitation I have... and this is just speaking from personal experience... the physical part of it is a real thing, man.”

This season, Pulisic appeared to be in the best form of his career before a low-grade hamstring tear in October, and bout of hip bursitis in January-February caused him to miss several matches.

“He's a phenomenal athlete, he is,” said Donovan.  “But some of the athletes in the Premier League are monsters. I mean monsters. And to do it, thirty-five, forty, forty-five times a year at that pace is really hard.

“I don't know, physically, if he could do it every single week for two or three years, like some of these guys. Because it's really hard, man. It is really hard.”

The Latest | Feb 17, 2026

KANSAS CITY (Feb. 17, 2026) — Kansas City Current forward/midfielder Ally Sentnor has been named to the United States Women's National Team (USWNT) roster for the 2026 SheBelieves Cup presented by Visa, as announced by U.S. Soccer on Tuesday. Sentnor is part of the 26-player roster for one of the most prestigious four-team tournaments in women's soccer.

The 2026 SheBelieves Cup schedule will see the USA open the tournament against Argentina on Sunday, March 1, at 4 p.m. CT at GEODIS Park in Nashville, Tenn. The Stars and Stripes then play Canada on Wednesday, March 4, at 5:45 p.m. CT at ScottsMiracle-Gro Field in Columbus, Ohio – the site of the 2026 NWSL Challenge Cup between the KC Current and Gotham FC on June 26.

The tournament concludes at Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, N.J., on Saturday, March 7, with the U.S. taking on Colombia at 2:30 p.m. CT. All three matches will be broadcast on TBS, TNT and/or truTV, Telemundo and Universo and streamed on HBO Max and Peacock. The games will also be available on the radio in English on Westwood One and in Spanish on Futbol de Primera.

Sentnor's initial USWNT call-up was in November 2024, and she has been called into all but one senior camp since. She has six goals and three assists in 15 caps with seven starts entering the 2026 SheBelieves Cup.

Most recently, Sentnor had a two-goal performance in a 6-0 rout of Paraguay on Jan. 24 to open her 2026 scoring account. It was her second brace in a U.S. uniform, the first which came on June 3, 2025, in a friendly with Jamaica. Her first senior team cap was on Nov. 30, 2024, against England in front of over 78,000 fans at Wembley Stadium.

Sentnor's breakthrough was a year ago at the 2025 SheBelieves Cup where she finished the event with two goals and an assist. She scored in her first senior national team start on Feb. 20, 2025, against Colombia to become the first U.S. player to score her first USWNT goal in the SheBelieves Cup Tournament. A month before her 2025 SheBelieves Cup breakthrough, Sentnor was named the 2024 U.S. Soccer Young Female Player of the Year.

The annual 2026 SheBelieves Cup will kick off on March 1, and U.S. women's national team head coach Emma Hayes has named a 26-player roster ahead of the tournament. The 11th annual SheBelieves Cup is a four-team invitational featuring the United States, Argentina, Canada, and Colombia. As Hayes narrows her player pool ahead of November's Concacaf W Championship -- the region's World Cup qualifiers -- the SheBelieves Cup marks the start of qualifying preparations for the looming 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup. 

A tournament blend of Concacaf and CONMEBOL opposition will test the Stars and Stripes with styles that they could see again during qualifiers. 

"The SheBelieves Cup is a fantastic tournament which gives us the opportunity to replicate the group stage of a FIFA tournament," said Hayes. "Three quality games in quick succession also allow us to replicate conditions that will prepare us for the World Cup qualifying campaign this fall. As always, we want to keep developing our player pool to be more and more prepared. As we gain more experience, I expect our standards to keep improving."

The SheBelieves Cup rosters were expanded to 26 players, up from 23 in previous editions, and this year's camps will allow coaches to name 23 players to dress for match dates. Gameday rosters can be rotated to feature any of the 26 selected players. Eleven players who were not in the January camps return to this roster, while 15 holdovers from the January roster earned a place on the SheBelieves Cup list.

While the January camps were held outside an official FIFA window, the SheBelieves Cup roster welcomes several European-based players back into the mix, including midfielder Sam Coffey, who recently transferred to Manchester City from the NWSL's Portland Thorns.

In perhaps a symbolic turning of the page, there are no players on the roster with zero appearances. This is the first time since the 2025 SheBelieves Cup that a USWNT roster has not featured an uncapped player. Hayes has given 32 players their first caps in 32 games as manager. No other full-time USWNT manager named more than 36 different starters in their first 30 games as head coach. 

Players listed by position (club, caps/goals)

Goalkeepers (3): Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign FC; 7), Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals; 5), Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United, ENG; 4)

Midfielders (8): Sam Coffey (Manchester City, ENG; 42/5), Lindsey Heaps (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 170/38), Claire Hutton (Bay FC; 13/1), Riley Jackson (North Carolina Courage; 1/0), Rose Lavelle (Gotham FC; 116/27), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC; 13/5), Jaedyn Shaw (Gotham FC; 31/9), Lily Yohannes (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 13/1)

Forwards (6): Maddie Dahlien (Seattle Reign FC; 2/0), Jameese Joseph (Chicago Stars FC; 2/1), Trinity Rodman (Washington Spirit; 49/13), Emma Sears (Racing Louisville FC; 14/6), Ally Sentnor (Kansas City Current; 15/6), Alyssa Thompson (Chelsea FC, ENG; 26/3)

National team veterans Sophia Wilson and Catarina Macario did not make the cut for the SheBelieves Cup roster for varying fitness reasons, with Hayes admitting on Tuesday that the pair would likely have been part of the group if they were fit enough to take part.

Wilson has not been with the national team since 2024 and spent all of 2025 on maternity leave, though she has returned to training with the Portland Thorns and expects to be fit for the start of the NWSL season in mid-March. Though Hayes and Wilson both wanted the player to take part in March's USWNT matches, the Thorns ultimately decided Wilson was not fit enough for the opportunity this time around.

"Soph and I spoke and she's just not ready," Hayes said. "The return to play protocol has just not given her enough time, I think, for her to be in the place she wanted to be in so it's right that she's not in the squad, however much I want her to be. The reality is Portland didn't her deem her to be."

As for Macario, Hayes disclosed that the player is dealing with a heel injury. She did not comment on Macario's club situation, which has been the source of some speculation in recent weeks -- she has not played for Chelsea since December 10 and has since been left off the team's UEFA Women's Champions League roster, all while being linked to a move to the NWSL's San Diego Wave.

"My understanding is that she has a heel injury. She's getting closer and closer every day," Hayes said before adding that Macario's exact timeline to return to the pitch is unclear. "I don't know when that's going to be but she's not available for selection."

Other players like defender Avery Patterson and midfielder Croix Bethune, the latter of whom was part of a blockbuster trade to the Kansas City Current last week, were also left off because they do not have enough reps under their belts during preseason. Their absences, though, afforded opportunities to another batch of rising USWNT stars -- midfielder Riley Tiernan and forward Maddie Dahlien, who earned their first caps last month, will now join a more experienced version of the U.S. team for a SheBelieves Cup that simulates a tournament setting. Forward Jameese Joseph also got the nod in large part because Wilson and Macario were unavailable.

"If Cat Macario and Sophia Wilson were available for selection, they would've been selected as the [No.] 9s," Hayes said before reinforcing her longstanding project to expand the player pool. "We have to develop more nines and [Joseph] said, 'That's where I want to be.'"

Tottenham have been brutally informed that there is no chance of Harry Kane pulling on their famous lilywhite shirt again. The England captain severed career-long ties with Spurs in 2023 as the club's all-time leading scorer and lifted his trophy curse in Germany with Bayern Munich. A return to the Premier League has been mooted, but Bobby Zamora has told GOAL why such a switch is unlikely to happen.

Kane walked away from north London as Tottenham's all-time leading scorer, having recorded 280 goals through 435 appearances. Major silverware proved elusive, leading to a big-money move to the Allianz Arena being made.

Tangible success has been savoured there, becoming a Bundesliga title winner, while stunning individual standards have been maintained by a man who now has 500 career goals to his name - becoming the first Englishman to hit that milestone.

Many have suggested that Kane could be tempted to head back to his homeland and chase down Alan Shearer's Premier League goal record. Spurs would be given the chance to match any offers for their former fan favourite. 

Zamora cannot see a deal being agreed, with the former frontman - speaking in association with William Hill - telling GOAL when asked if we will ever see Kane playing for Tottenham again: “I don't think we will. He's happy there and doing very, very well. It will be interesting. I can't see it.

“If he comes back to England for a last hurrah, I think he will want a real opportunity to win one of the major trophies in England. If it's one season, or two seasons he has back in the Premier League, he will certainly want to give himself the opportunity to win something - because obviously he never managed that at Spurs. As things stand, they don't look like frontrunners to be able to nab him, in my opinion.”

Another former Spurs star, Danny Murphy, told GOAL recently when asked if Kane back to Spurs could become a 50/50 call: “I would think much less. Harry Kane is succeeding where he is at the moment - more than succeeding, he's flying and scoring a lot of goals. He's in a team where he thinks he can compete for the Champions League. He's won his first league title, first trophy.

“There is always the family factor. We can never know about how that is. I remember Michael Owen being in Spain and a year in just wanting to come home with the family. We don't know that side of Kane's life. But from a football perspective, to go back to Tottenham, there is only one reason he would go back there and that's because of the fact that the fans love him. In terms of football reasons, it would be to try and break Alan Shearer's record.

“The way he is playing, if he wanted to leave Munich, I think he would have other options where he could go to another club and compete for the biggest honours on the planet - domestic titles and the Champions League. It sounds romantic going back to Tottenham but the reality is that he'd be going there to win a League Cup or an FA Cup. It's a downgrade. He would be downgrading. His level of performance at the moment, he doesn't need to.”

Bayern have claimed that release clauses in Kane's contract, which were said to come in at £57 million ($77m), have now expired. He is, however, only tied to terms until 2027 and may decide that he has another new challenge in him.

There has been talk of La Liga giants Barcelona and Real Madrid showing interest, with Zamora adding when asked if a switch to Spain would be a sensible career move: “Yeah, I think so. He's still absolutely banging in goals, still an absolute threat. The likes of Real Madrid would fit very well, create chances - Barcelona as well - give him that ball in the box and he's going to score you goals. 

“He's the ultimate. Any of those teams that create a couple of chances a game will certainly be looking at him because they know it's going to be goals every single week. If you put the ball into a certain area, with Harry, he is going to score.”

Kane has found the target on 41 occasions for Bayern this season, through 35 appearances. He has 26 efforts in the Bundesliga and is chasing down Robert Lewandowski's single campaign record - which stands at 41.

After bringing another bid for domestic and continental honours to a close, with Champions League dreams also being clung to, Kane - who is his country's record scorer - will captain England at the 2026 World Cup.

U.S. men's national team striker Haji Wright scored a hat-trick in Coventry City's 3–1 win over Middlesbrough, becoming just the fourth player in Championship history to score a trio of goals against the leaders of the division.

The Sky Blues trailed Boro by two points heading into Monday's contest, but after Wright's devastating performance in front of goal it's Frank Lampard's side that are now in pole position to return to the Premier League for the first time since 2000–01. 

Wright, 27, had been kept quiet for the most part since the start of 2026, but Monday's hat-trick saw him up his goal tally on the year to five and get within one goal of Swansea's Žan Vipotnik in the Championship's Golden Boot race, upping his account to 13 goals. 

In a game that could have a decisive impact on the title race, Wright proved his quality and emphatically decided the clash.

Wright's performance began with him hitting the post with his first header of the night, dominantly winning the ball in the air in a sign of what was to come. He then showcased his strength and physicality, using his imposing frame to shield the ball and tuck home a first-time weak-foot finish into the corner.

His physicality saw him gain the upper hand in most aerial duels and his ability to read the play led directly to Coventry's second. Wright took advantage of a split-second defensive lapse, getting across his marker to rifle a vicious strike into the bottom corner of Sol Brynn's goal.

A goal from USMNT midfielder Riley McGree got Boro back into the game, but Wright kept his cool from the penalty spot after Matt Targett had been penalised for handball to bury his effort from 12 yards into the side netting.

“In games like this, it's so important to be clinical in the right moments,” Lampard said, praising Wright's performance following the match. 

Folarin Balogun appears to have the upper hand in the battle to be the USMNT's starting striker in the 2026 World Cup, but Wright could likely be the next in line—his case strengthened by the fact Ricardo Pepi's fractured forearm has kept him sidelined since early January. 

This weekend, fellow Championship striker Patrick Agyemang scored his 10th goal of the season for Derby County. Not to be outshined, Wright's hat-trick performance on Monday served as a resounding response in the battle for a striker spot in the USMNT roster. 

A sensational start of the season from Wright was crowned by the brace he scored against Australia during an October international friendly, yet he then went 15 appearances for club and country without a goal.

Five goals in his last three appearances has helped Wright to rediscover his mojo, and it's impossible to imagine that Pochettino won't have been impressed by what he saw.

Club's 52,000-square-foot facility in East Charlotte to serve as team training site for Scottish FA during world's marquee sporting event

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (Tuesday, February 17, 2026) – Charlotte FC today announced the Scotland National Team selected the Club's training facility as Team Base Camp training site for FIFA World Cup 2026™.

The 52,000-square-foot facility provides a state-of-the-art setting for the Scottish FA's official training site and team headquarters as they prepare for Group C matches against Haiti, Morocco and Brazil.

“We're excited to welcome Scotland, one of the world's most historic footballing associations, to Charlotte for the FIFA World Cup,” said Tepper Sports & Entertainment CEO Kristi Coleman. “This summer brings the biggest sporting event North America has seen this century, and we're honored for Charlotte FC to be named a team base camp for a major European nation. Scotland joins a prestigious group of national teams and elite foreign clubs that have utilized Charlotte FC as a training base, and the team's arrival strengthens our facility's growing reputation as one of the nation's premier club headquarters. We look forward to collaborating with the Scottish FA and FIFA to deliver a world-class experience for their staff, players and fans in our vibrant city.”

The facility, located in East Charlotte, opened in 2023 and features access to eight soccer fields for sporting and community use. The building houses all teams under the Charlotte FC umbrella including the First Team, the Club's second team, Crown Legacy FC, and all academy age groups.

“It is our honor to host the Scotland National Team at our home for this summer's FIFA World Cup, and we're proud that our facility reflects the high standards of a nation competing on the world's biggest stage,” said Charlotte FC General Manager Zoran Krneta. “At Charlotte FC, we have built a high-performance training center that supports the day-to-day demands required for elite competition. Our facility ensures Scotland has every advantage as they set their sights on the world's biggest prize and we wish them all the success at the FIFA World Cup.”

The facility features locker rooms for all teams, a cafeteria designed for player nutrition, and a 2,800-square-foot weight room. It is also home to the Club's business staff.

“We are delighted to confirm Charlotte as our training base. We looked at the FIFA-nominated options, against our own predetermined criteria, and Charlotte FC have a top MLS training facility with everything we need to prepare for our matches,” said Scotland National Team Head Coach Steve Clarke. “I'd like to add that Charlotte FC's staff could not have been more welcoming. As most competing nations have discovered, travel will be an important factor in this World Cup. Our base in Charlotte will be convenient for the airport, with flights around two hours to Boston and Miami for our group stage matches. We are hopeful that this will give us the best possible conditions to get ready for the tournament and it's another exciting landmark ahead of the summer.”

Scotland returns to the FIFA World Cup™ for the first time since 1998 after finishing top of their group in UEFA qualifying outlasting Denmark in dramatic fashion on the final day of matches. The Scots are led by captain Andy Robertson (Liverpool), Serie A MVP award winner Scott McTominay (Napoli), and former Charlotte FC Head Coach Dean Smith disciple John McGinn (Aston Villa).

Beyond McGinn, the Scottish connections to Charlotte FC flow to Technical Director Tommy Wilson who began his career as the Football Development Officer for the Scottish FA. Additionally, John Currie, the Club's Director of High Performance, spent over a decade in Scottish football with Celtic FC and Heart of Midlothian FC.

This will mark the second consecutive summer that Charlotte FC's facilities will be utilized by a team competing in a globalized FIFA competition. The Club's stadium hosted four FIFA Club World Cup 2025™ matches, delivering the second-highest attended group stage game of the tournament with 70,248 fans in Uptown to see Real Madrid vs Pachuca.

Charlotte will not host any matches for this summer's FIFA World Cup™ but will be the site where the United States Men's National Team play its penultimate friendly ahead of the tournament. The match against African champions Senegal will take place on Sunday, May 31.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Scotland's national soccer team will use Charlotte FC's training facility as its base camp for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the club announced Tuesday.

The Scottish FA selected the 52,000-square-foot facility in east Charlotte as its official training site and team headquarters as Scotland prepares for Group C matches against Haiti, Morocco, and Brazil.

"Charlotte FC have a top MLS training facility with everything we need to prepare for our matches," Scotland Head Coach Steve Clarke said. "Our base in Charlotte will be convenient for the airport, with flights around two hours to Boston and Miami for our group stage matches."

The facility, which opened in 2023, features eight soccer fields, locker rooms, a cafeteria designed for player nutrition, and a 2,800-square-foot weight room. It serves as the home base for Charlotte FC's first team, second team Crown Legacy FC, and all academy age groups.

Scotland returns to the World Cup for the first time since 1998 after finishing atop their UEFA qualifying group. The squad is led by captain Andy Robertson of Liverpool, Serie A MVP Scott McTominay of Napoli, and Aston Villa midfielder John McGinn, who played under former Charlotte FC head coach Dean Smith.

The Scottish connections to Charlotte FC run deeper than the field. Club Technical Director Tommy Wilson began his career as the Football Development Officer for the Scottish FA, and Director of High Performance John Currie spent more than a decade in Scottish football with Celtic FC and Heart of Midlothian FC.

"We are delighted to confirm Charlotte as our training base," Clarke said. "Charlotte FC's staff could not have been more welcoming. We are hopeful that this will give us the best possible conditions to get ready for the tournament."

Tepper Sports & Entertainment CEO Kristi Coleman called the announcement a significant moment for the city heading into the summer.

"This summer brings the biggest sporting event North America has seen this century, and we're honored for Charlotte FC to be named a team base camp for a major European nation," Coleman said.

The announcement marks the second consecutive summer Charlotte FC's facilities have been used for a major FIFA event. The club's stadium hosted four matches during the FIFA Club World Cup 2025, including the second-highest attended group stage game of the tournament when 70,248 fans packed Bank of America Stadium to watch Real Madrid face Pachuca.

Charlotte will not host any World Cup matches this summer, but the city will serve as the site of the United States Men's National Team's penultimate tune-up before the tournament. The USMNT will face African champions Senegal on May 31.

The city of Charlotte isn't hosting a match in the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

But the Queen City will still be involved in the festivities.

Charlotte FC announced on Tuesday that the Scotland National Team will set up shop in Atrium Health Performance Park — the practice facility of the city's MLS club — for the duration of the World Cup, which will begin June 11 and run until mid-July.

The 52,000-square-foot facility in East Charlotte opened in October 2023 and includes locker rooms, a cafeteria, a large weight room, fields and offices utilized by Charlotte FC's business staff. Scotland will use all of these amenities as its headquarters ahead of the team's Group C matches against Haiti, Morocco and Brazil.

“We're excited to welcome Scotland, one of the world's most historic football associations, to Charlotte for the FIFA World Cup,” Tepper Sports and Entertainment CEO Kristi Coleman wrote in a statement. “This summer bring the biggest sporting event North America has seen this century, and we're honored for Charlotte FC to be named a team base camp for a major European nation.”

Scotland is making its return to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.

Charlotte now joins two other North Carolina cities that will be hosting national teams during the World Cup. Germany will set up its base training site in Winston-Salem, and Norway will be in Greensboro.

Scotland head coach Steve Clarke told UK media outlets last week that “we have secured Charlotte as a base for the team.” That news became official Tuesday, and Clarke expanded on why Charlotte FC's place fit what he was looking for.

“We are delighted to confirm Charlotte as our training base,” Clarke stated via a release. “We looked at the FIFA-nominated options, against our own predetermined criteria, and Charlotte FC (has) a top MLS training facility with everything we need to prepare for our matches.

“I'd like to add that Charlotte FC's staff could not have been more welcoming. As most competing nations have discovered, travel will be an important factor in this World Cup. Our base in Charlotte will be convenient for the airport, with flights around two hours to Boston and Miami for our group stage matches. We are hopeful that this will give us the best possible conditions to get ready for the tournament, and it's another exciting landmark ahead of the summer.”

In the group stage, Scotland will play two matches at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, and one match at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.

The Scottish FA and Charlotte FC have a few prominent connections. Among them:

This will mark the second consecutive summer Charlotte FC's facilities will be utilized by a team playing in a global FIFA competition. Bank of America Stadium was the site of four FIFA Club World Cup matches last summer.

Even though Charlotte won't officially host any matches in this summer's World Cup, it will be the site of a “send-off” friendly ahead of the tournament, pitting the U.S. Men's National Team against Senegal on May 31.

File photo: Super Eagles players

Kindly share this story:

Nigerians continue to await the verdict of world football governing body, FIFA, over a petition submitted by the Nigeria Football Federation, alleging that DR Congo fielded ineligible players during last November's 2025 World Cup African play-offs.
FIFA's decision, earlier reported to be announced after the body's meeting on Monday, has yet to be released and is now expected on Tuesday (today).
African football fans, especially Nigerians, continue to await the ruling, given that the outcome could potentially reinstate the Super Eagles into the intercontinental play-offs in Mexico later this month, where one of the last World Cup tickets is on offer.
PUNCH Online outlines key things to know about the case.  




The match in question
In November 2025, Nigeria's Super Eagles lost to DR Congo 4–3 on penalties in the African play-off final for 2026 World Cup qualification, ending their chances of qualifying for the tournament.
Nigeria's protest
The NFF filed a formal complaint with FIFA in December 2025, alleging that DR Congo fielded ineligible players who recently switched nationalities.
Key players accused
Nigeria claims several DR Congo players, including Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Axel Tuanzebe, hold dual nationalities, potentially violating eligibility rules.        
DR Congo's nationality law
The core argument hinges on DR Congo's constitution, which reportedly prohibits dual citizenship. Nigeria argues that DR Congo's fielding of players with dual citizenship conflicts with FIFA's player eligibility and nationality-switch procedures.  Related News  77% of CAS cases in 2025 were football-related, FIFA report shows  FULL LIST: Fixture of CAF Champions League quarter-finals, semi-finals  'Napoli treated me like a dog' before Galatasaray move — Osimhen   
What Nigeria wants
The NFF is pushing for DR Congo's disqualification from the play-off result, which could lead to a forfeited match and/or a 3–0 award to Nigeria. Other sanctions may also be imposed on the Central African nation.
Possible outcomes if the petition is upheld
If FIFA finds violations, options include match forfeiture, points adjustments, fines, or disqualification, though such measures are rare in knockout play-offs without clear evidence of fraud.
Possible outcomes if the petition is rejected
DR Congo's result would stand, confirming their advancement, and Nigeria's 2026 World Cup hopes would end without further recourse.
Historical precedents
Past FIFA rulings on ineligibility show that the body can overturn results or impose penalties, though each case depends on its context.
No verdict yet
As of Tuesday, FIFA has not issued any official ruling.
Fake news
Unconfirmed reports circulating on Monday claimed that FIFA ruled in Nigeria's favour. 
   
However, NFF Director of Communications Ademola Olajire stated, “There is no decision from FIFA at this time. Any claims that a ruling has been made are false.”
Alternative outcome if the petition is upheld
Even if DR Congo is awarded a 3–0 loss, a favourable ruling for Nigeria might not guarantee automatic qualification. It could lead to replays or other adjustments, and other nations, such as Cameroon, have been speculated as potential beneficiaries.

Nigeria are set to miss out on a second successive edition of the Fifa World Cup

There is a mix of hope and frustration as Nigeria supporters await Fifa's decision on allegations that DR Congo fielded ineligible players during Africa's 2026 World Cup play-offs.

The Congolese beat the Super Eagles on penalties in November to book their place in an intercontinental qualifier for the finals in Canada, Mexico and the United States.

The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) submitted a complaint to Fifa in December, arguing that Leopards players such as Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Axel Tuanzebe - both former England youth internationals - were ineligible because Congolese law does not allow dual citizenship.

While a section of the Super Eagles fanbase is hoping the side could secure a lifeline, others are questioning the fairness of a potential qualification by appeal.

Fifa has confirmed the matter is under review but the world governing body has not issued a timetable for a ruling and the NFF has moved to quash speculation that its complaint has been thrown out.

"Any claims that a ruling has been made are false," NFF director of communications Demola Olajire said.

"Fifa has not communicated any verdict to us or to the Congolese federation."

At the time of the protest, NFF general secretary Mohammed Sanusi argued DR Congo had breached Fifa's regulations.

Tuanzebe and Wan-Bissaka also subsequently featured for the Leopards at the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Morocco.

"The Congolese rule (law) says you cannot have dual nationality but some of their players have European and French passports," Sanusi stated.

"Our contention is that Fifa was deceived into clearing them."

The Congolese Football Federation rejected the NFF's challenge, branding the petition as an attempt to "win via the back door".

The Leopards will face either New Caledonia or Jamaica in March's intercontinental play-off, with the winner progressing to the expanded 48-team World Cup and joining Group K alongside Portugal, Uzbekistan and Colombia.

This is not the first time African qualification campaigns have spilled into courtrooms and committee rooms. 

Such episodes often expose the tension between Fifa's statutes, which prioritise sporting nationality as recognised by the governing body, and national laws which may impose stricter definitions of citizenship. 

Past rulings suggest that Fifa tends to lean on its own regulations but each case rests on its own specific facts and documentation.

Fifa statutes set out the conditions under which a player may change the national association they represent.

Under these rules, a player may ask to change the association they represent only once and the process requires a written and substantiated request which must be approved by Fifa's players' status committee. 

While Fifa requires a player to hold a passport for the new nation they wish to represent, it is possible for them to also hold another passport.

That discrepancy between domestic laws and Fifa's eligibility framework may have fuelled the legal ambiguity upon which Nigeria's hopes hinge.

The NFF argues that some Congolese players held European passports, a point not directly accounted for in Fifa's eligibility checks, and contends that if those domestic laws were breached then the players should not have been cleared to participate. 

The petition also suggested that Fifa may have been provided with incomplete or misleading documentation when eligibility approvals were sought for the players, a claim which, if upheld, could raise wider governance concerns.

With a decision expected from Fifa, a ruling in Nigeria's favour could prompt closer scrutiny of player documentation for other African nations, with federations keen to avoid similar challenges.

When a formal protest reaches Fifa, there are several possible outcomes:

Dismissal: Fifa may find the NFF's evidence insufficient and close the case, leaving DR Congo's progress in World Cup qualification intact.

Investigation and administrative sanction: Fifa could investigate and, if it finds breaches in the clearance process, sanction the federation (eg fines, warnings) but leave results unchanged.

Sporting sanctions: In the most serious cases, Fifa or the Confederation of African Football could order a forfeit or award the match to the other side, or deduct points in group-stage contexts. Historically, such sporting sanctions are applied when administrative or player registration rules are clearly and materially breached, such as with falsification or deliberate misrepresentation.

For Nigeria, the stakes are clear.

The Super Eagles may have won bronze at the 2025 Afcon, reasserting themselves among the continent's elite, but the stark reality is the side, as it stands, is set to miss out on a second successive edition of the World Cup.

DR Congo, meanwhile, have taken more than half a century to get close to returning to football's biggest stage after becoming Africa's first sub-Saharan nation to reach the tournament in 1974 (when the country was called Zaire).

The possibility that an administrative ruling could undo success achieved on the field is something that may unsettle many neutral observers.

"I have a really incredible team that buys for us, and I know that they have been planning for this for quite some time. We already knew that this was going to be a huge, huge thing," said Jess Knust, store manager.

"I have a really incredible team that buys for us, and I know that they have been planning for this for quite some time. We already knew that this was going to be a huge, huge thing," said Jess Knust, store manager.

"I have a really incredible team that buys for us, and I know that they have been planning for this for quite some time. We already knew that this was going to be a huge, huge thing," said Jess Knust, store manager.

The FIFA Men's World Cup is 114 days away, and soccer stores across the Kansas City Metro are stocking gear to be ready for the roaring rush of soccer fans. 

One of those places is Soccer Master, a Missouri-based retailer tucked away on 135th Street in Overland Park, Kansas.  

You could say the store is getting pumped for this kick of fandom expected this summer that'll reach well beyond their normal KC customer base.

"Everyone's so excited," Jess Knust, store manager, said. 

She said she might need to add two or three more full-time employees to her roster of six if the store needs more help with orders. 

"Everyone is trying to decide if they're going to games, if they're couch surfing and watching, or going to the parties that are going to be happening," Knust said. 

As for the soccer merch, for the last two months, Soccer Master has been accumulating over 150 World Cup-related pieces.

 "I have a really incredible team that buys for us, and I know that they have been planning for this for quite some time. We already knew that this was going to be a huge, huge thing," Knust said. 

She said it takes her five business days from placing a shipment order to delivery in her store. Knust will be turning one large corner of the space into a "World Cup hub" with hats, balls, jerseys and signs. 

"So we're working on getting all the different federations here into store, and if I'm not going to carry it in store, I will be able to get it," Knust said. 

She tells KMBC 9 that Adidas and Puma home kits are easy to come by right now. In-store, she has home jerseys from Argentina, Spain, Mexico, Germany, Belgium, Colombia, Italy, Portugal, Austria and Algeria. Knust tells KMBC 9 she can also customize any of these jerseys. 

"Coming is (the) United States, the Netherlands, England, Croatia, Brazil. I'm missing so many cause we're getting so many," Knust said.

Away kits are expected sometime in April or May. She's already sold at least 100 Argentina jerseys, if not more, and expects USA merch to be the highest in demand. Knust tells KMBC 9 the USA gear will show up in March or April. 

"This is from the '94 World Cup, which is really kind of cool. That was the last time it was here in the United States," Knust said. 

She is also selling a whole set of mini World Cup balls. Each one comes with a stand and the oldest ball is from 1970 — the Telestar ball.  

"Italy is one of those teams that is playing in the playoff, so we're not sure if they've made the tournament yet, but it looks good," Knust said. 

After the playoffs in early March, she expects more international soccer gear will break away. 

"We're going to be working to pull those items in pretty quick," Knust said. "I can't wait to see and meet people that are coming into town from out of town, and it's just going to be a really good time. It's the people I'm excited for."

Knust said she's still working out where Soccer Master will host pop-up sales and which partnerships the store will create with other businesses for the World Cup.

...

The disciplinary fallout from the Derby d'Italia has been swift and severe, with the Italian sporting judge handing down heavy sanctions following the chaotic scenes at San Siro. The harshest punishment has been reserved for Juventus CEO Comolli, who has been banned from all football activities until March 31, 2026. The severity of the ban reflects the gravity of the incident detailed in the official match report, which describes an executive who completely lost his composure in the heat of the moment.

The report paints a disturbing picture of the interval, stating that Comolli displayed an "aggressive and seriously intimidating attitude" towards referee La Penna. The situation escalated rapidly in the tunnel, where the CEO reportedly attempted to make physical contact with the official. He was only prevented from doing so by the physical intervention of the Juventus coaching staff and other club employees, who had to restrain him. Furthermore, Comolli was cited for using "gravely insulting" language, a tirade that reportedly continued even outside the officials' dressing room long after the teams had separated.

The official findings suggest that the half-time interval teetered on the brink of a physical brawl. The image of a high-ranking club executive having to be held back by his own technical team has resulted in a €15,000 fine to accompany Comolli's lengthy suspension. However, he was not the only Juventus director to let his frustrations boil over.

Chiellini, a man who spent decades battling in these high-stakes fixtures as a player, also found himself in the crosshairs of the sporting judge. The legendary former defender turned director will be sidelined from official duties until February 27, 2026. While his conduct was deemed less physically threatening than Comolli's, the report noted that Chiellini contested the referee's performance in a "disrespectful manner." He was also cited for directing "offensive criticisms" at the assistant referees as the tunnel melee unfolded, adding to the sense of total breakdown in relations between the club and the officials.

The root cause of this administrative explosion was the dismissal of Kalulu for a second yellow card - a decision Juventus firmly believe was manufactured by a clear simulation from the opposition. With replays appearing to show minimal contact, the sense of injustice within the Bianconeri camp has morphed into a direct attack on the governance of Italian referees. Chiellini did not mince words in the aftermath, turning his fire on referee designator Gianluca Rocchi and demanding systemic change.

"We cannot talk about football after what happened today. Something truly unacceptable happened today, no matter whether it happens to us or someone else," Chiellini raged, clearly feeling that the standard of officiating has reached a crisis point. "Starting tomorrow it seems VAR must change, because it is unacceptable that so many errors continue to happen even in big matches like this."

Comolli went even further, framing the incident not just as a loss for Juventus, but as a black eye for the entire Serie A brand. With the Derby d'Italia being one of the most-watched fixtures in global football, the CEO expressed deep embarrassment at the spectacle presented to the international audience.

"Clearly, as a club we feel today is very embarrassing. It's a disgrace what happened today, and we feel strongly as a club from the ownership, fans, players, to the coach, this must not happen again," Comolli remarked. He lamented the repetitive nature of these controversies, adding: "It happens again and again... tonight is a summary of what we have seen this season. For a match like this, with the whole world watching." To compound the misery for the Old Lady, the sporting judge confirmed Kalulu will serve a one-match suspension, leaving Juve shorthanded as they look to recover from this blow in their pursuit of the Scudetto.

Haji Wright put his best foot forward in letting U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino that he wants to be a part of the World Cup team.

The former New York Cosmos striker, who had been in a personal drought for several months, converted his third hat-trick for host Coventry City, which recorded a 3-1 win over Middlesbrough to regain first place int the English Championship.

Coventry, which is keen to earn automatic promotion to the Premier League, improved to 18-6-8 and 62 points, one point better than Middlesbrough (18-7-7, 61).

“When you're a striker, you want to score goals,” Wright told Paramount+. “I was hoping to get back into form, and tonight was a great opportunity for that

“It was a great night to come out and show what we can do.”

Wright, who has 13 goals, two behind the league leader, scored from six yards in the 21st minute, volleyed home a shot in the 55th minute and converted a penalty kick in the 71st minute.

 NFF lodged a complaint with FIFA challenging the eligibility status of certain DR Congo players

The Nigeria Football Federation, NFF, has dismissed rumours regarding a decision from FIFA concerning Nigeria's protest against the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) over allegations of fielding ineligible players.

The controversy arose after Nigeria's Super Eagles were eliminated by DR Congo in a penalty shootout during the World Cup play-offs for the African zone last November, ending their chances of qualifying for the intercontinental play-offs later this year.

In response, the NFF lodged a formal complaint with FIFA, challenging the eligibility status of certain players from the DR Congo squad.

The NFF's stance is based on Congolese laws that do not recognize dual nationality, suggesting that some players representing the Leopards may have held European passports.

However, the NFF has now confirmed that FIFA has not rendered any judgment on the issue.

Ademola Olajire, NFF's Director of Communications, labeled reports indicating a ruling favouring either Nigeria or DR Congo as “false.”

“There is no decision from FIFA at this time. Any claims that a ruling has been made are false. FIFA has not communicated any verdict to the NFF or the Congolese federation,” Olajire said via 234Sports.

The Champions League trophy on display at holders Paris Saint-Germain's Parc des Princes stadium last August Franck Fife/Getty Images

The holders and the record winners — Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid — will compete in the Champions League's knockout play-offs this month.

Twelve of the 36 teams were eliminated in January following the wild final round of the league phase, so things are starting to shape up. Last month's draw means we can forecast the possible matchups in the round of 16, which starts in March.

As the league phase's top eight sit with their feet up, the 16 teams who finished ninth to 24th will compete over two legs this midweek and next to decide who joins them in the Champions League's last 16.

And there are plenty of potential narratives unfolding. Could Jose Mourinho torment former employers Real Madrid again? Will Bodo/Glimt cause another upset? Can Monaco overcome Ligue 1 rivals and defending champions PSG? We take a look at what's coming up, and what it all might mean.

Last season, the Champions League introduced a revamped format. Instead of four-team groups competing against each other home and away, 36 teams were all together in one league table. Teams play eight matches, all against different teams, to determine their final position.

Following the league phase, which concludes with 18 games kicking off simultaneously on one January night, the top eight sides in the standings automatically qualify for the round of 16. The bottom 12 are eliminated, leaving the teams who finished from ninth to 24th. They must compete in the play-off round, eight ties contested over two legs, for the right to face a top-eight opponent in the last 16 in March.

The first legs are on February 17 and 18 — four today (Tuesday), four Wednesday — with the second legs on the reverse days a week later.

Real Madrid have won the Champions League 15 times but failed to finish in this season's top eight after a dramatic 4-2 defeat against Benfica in their final league-phase game. Goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin scored a last-gasp winner, sending former Madrid manager Mourinho flying down the touchline in celebration. The twist? Madrid have a chance to redeem themselves after subsequently being drawn against… Benfica in the play-offs.

For the second season in a row, PSG face a fellow Ligue 1 club in the play-offs. Last year, they cruised past Brest 10-0 on aggregate and went on to win the competition. Will history repeat itself?



Hoping to cause further upsets, Bodo/Glimt beat Manchester City and Atletico Madrid to end the league phase in 23rd place. The Norwegians' prize is a tie against Inter, last year's beaten finalists.

Newcastle United, who face Qarabag of Azerbaijan, and Juventus, up against Turkey's Galatasaray, are among the other teams competing in the play-off round. The clubs who finished ninth to 16th were seeded in the draw, so will get to play their tie's second legs at home.

The top eight are ‘paired', which means the sides finishing first and second will be placed on separate sides of the draw. We will know which side of the bracket these pairs fall on after the next knockout-stage draw (more on that below), but this is a look at the possible round-of-16 matchups.



Beyond that, the picture is less clear until the draw, but there could be all-Premier League quarter-finals between Manchester City and Arsenal, and Liverpool or Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea. Spain's big two Real Madrid and Barcelona cannot meet until at least the semi-finals, and last year's finalists — PSG and Inter — are on different sides of the bracket again.

Just as the sides who came ninth to 16th in the league phase are seeded in the play-offs, the top eight will have the advantage of a second leg at home in the round of 16.

The teams who finished first to fourth in the league phase are also seeded for the quarter-finals, giving them home advantage in those second legs if they progress. Then, the top two in the league phase, Arsenal and Bayern Munich, are seeded through to the semi-finals — all of their second legs will take place at home.

If an unseeded club beat a seeded one, they inherit their seeding position.

The draw for the remaining three knockout rounds is next Friday, February 27, a couple of days after the play-offs conclude. It will determine which side of the bracket the top eight pairings are on and set the tournament for the months ahead, leading to the final in Hungarian capital Budapest's Puskas Arena on Saturday, May 30.

Our projections, powered by Opta stats, rank Newcastle as the most likely play-off team to progress to the next round. According to Opta, they have a 90 per cent chance of overcoming Qarabag, despite some shaky Premier League form where they have won just once in five matches, losing three and drawing with last-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers.

PSG (86 per cent) and Inter (79 per cent), who met in last year's final, are also expected to reach the last 16.

The tightest of the eight ties is predicted to be between Borussia Dortmund, second in the Bundesliga, and Atalanta, sixth in Serie A, with our projections giving the German side a 56 per cent chance of going through. And Madrid (60 per cent) are not particularly strong favourites against Benfica three weeks on from that jaw-dropping defeat in Lisbon, when a win would have secured the Spanish side a top-eight finish.

The new Tour Architecture Council will recommend actionable improvements to the Tour framework that can be implemented as soon as the 2027 season.

On Tuesday, WTA Chair Valerie Camillo announced the launch of the new Tour Architecture Council to recommend actionable improvements to the Tour framework that can be implemented as soon as the 2027 season.

Here is Valerie's letter, in full:

Dear Players and Tournament Partners,

One of the most rewarding parts of stepping into my role as WTA Chair has been witnessing firsthand the momentum behind women's tennis, driven by our world-class players, incredible tournaments and dedicated fans. The 2026 season is off to a strong start, with elite competition and enthusiastic global fan engagement setting the stage for an exciting year and continued growth.

As Chair, it is my priority to help the WTA capitalize on this momentum and opportunity for the benefit of our members. Accordingly, I've spent time listening to and learning from players and tournaments to understand what is working -- and what isn't -- on Tour.  Over my first 90 days, there has been a clear sentiment across the Tour that the current calendar does not feel sustainable for players given the physical, professional and personal pressures of competing at the highest level. It's important we take a fresh, collaborative look at how to best preserve the high-quality competition that builds value for tournaments and provides an unparalleled experience for fans.

For this reason, today I am establishing the Tour Architecture Council, a representative working group convened by the WTA to develop meaningful improvements to the calendar, commitments and other core elements of the Tour framework. 

This group's initial mandate is to develop actionable recommendations for consideration by the WTA Board that can be implemented as soon as the 2027 season. The Council will focus first on areas where the WTA has direct authority to drive change, while also identifying longer-term opportunities that will require broader coordination across the sport.

The Council includes prominent voices from across the global tennis ecosystem, including players from around the world; leaders from premier tournaments across the Americas, Europe, and Asia; and WTA senior leadership -- including myself -- Tour CEO Portia Archer, and experts in Tour operations and calendar planning.

The Council will be chaired by current World No. 5 player Jessica Pegula. As Chair, Jessica brings an active top-player perspective to the Council's work. She will help guide discussions so they reflect the full range of different player experiences on Tour, while working alongside tournament representatives and WTA leadership as the group works to turn these perspectives into action. I am grateful to Jessica and all of the members of the Council for committing their valuable time and expertise to this important effort.

The WTA is uniquely positioned to do this work. Our structure allows us to bring together athletes and tournaments to make decisions impacting the future of our sport. For more than 50 years, this model has resulted in our players being recognized as some of the most renowned and highly compensated athletes in the world, and enabled global expansion for the Tour at an unprecedented level, with attendance and viewership surging. In today's environment, the WTA's convening power and the ability to translate feedback is the most powerful tool we have to deliver real change.

Women's tennis is a global growth engine for our sport, and the WTA is well-equipped to respond with clarity and purpose to today's realities and help position the Tour for continued success. I am grateful to serve as Chair at this important moment, and I look forward to working together to make informed and aligned decisions that support our athletes and the long-term strength of women's tennis.

Thank you for your continued engagement and commitment to our sport.

Sincerely,

Valerie CamilloChair, WTA

The three-time Grand Slam champion returns to the elite today after a strong start to his final season on the tour.ByJohn BerkokPublished Feb 16, 2026 copy_link

After announcing that this would be his last year on the tour, Stan Wawrinka has made a strong start to 2026, already winning five matches—which is more than he won the entire year in 2025.Today, after reaching the second round at the ATP 500 event in Rotterdam, he's rewarded with a return to the Top 100 for the first time since 2024, rising from No. 106 to No. 98 on the ATP rankings.And that's not all.At 40 years young, Wawrinka is the first 40-something to be ranked in the Top 100 of the ATP rankings since none other than Roger Federer in 2022, during Wimbledon that year.Federer, who was also 40 at the time, was ranked No. 97 during the weeks of June 27th and July 4th, 2022. He was already retired, but he fell out of the Top 100 for the last time—and off the rankings completely—on July 11th, 2022, when his points from reaching the quarterfinals of Wimbledon the year before dropped off.The last 40-something in the elite before Federer was Ivo Karlovic, who was also 40 when he was No. 95 the week of December 30th, 2019. He fell out for the last time on January 6th, 2020.And Feliciano Lopez almost achieved the feat in 2021, but he fell out of the Top 100 for the last time on September 13th of that year, exactly one week before his 40th birthday (September 20th, 2021).

Wawrinka isn't the only Grand Slam champion and former No. 3 bouncing back up the ATP rankings this week, as Marin Cilic jumps from No. 61 to No. 43 after reaching the semifinals in Rotterdam.It's the 2014 US Open winner's first time in the Top 50 since returning from multiple knee surgeries, in 2023 and 2024, which caused him to miss most of both of those seasons—and to actually fall off the rankings completely for a few weeks in early 2024.Speaking of surgery, former No. 8 Karolina Muchova is now at her highest ranking since returning in the summer of 2024 after undergoing wrist surgery, rising from No. 19 to No. 11 after winning the biggest title of her career at the WTA 1000 event in Doha.And Maria Sakkari, a former No. 3 whose ranking dropped after missing the entire fall season in 2024 due to a shoulder injury, is now at her highest ranking in almost a year after reaching the semifinals in Doha, jumping from No. 52 to No. 34 today.

Could Alejandro Tabilo be poised for a big week on clay in Brazil?

The Chilean lefty made a good start to his Rio Open presented by Claro on Monday when he ousted American Emilio Nava 6-3, 6-3 in only 63 minutes.

Tabilo is fresh off a run to the quarter-finals at the ATP 250 event in Buenos Aires, where he beat Joao Fonseca. Now the former No. 19 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, a three-time ATP Tour champion, will pursue his first ATP 500 title.

The victor claimed 86 per cent of his service points according to Infosys ATP Stats and did not face a break point against the American. Tabilo will next play qualifier Dino Prizmic or lucky loser Francesco Passaro.

German Yannick Hanfmann also came out of the gates well with a 7-6(3), 6-4 triumph against Brazilian wild card Joao Lucas Reis Da Silva. 

“Very satisfied, of course. Getting through a tough first match playing a Brazilian on the centre court is not the easiest task,” Hanfmann said. “I knew that, especially a night session. I served quite well, tried to stay composed throughout the whole match. I knew it was going to be tricky.”



Serbian Dusan Lajovic, an ATP Masters 1000 finalist on clay at Monte-Carlo in 2019, earned his first Lexus ATP Head2Head series win against Daniel Altmaier 6-4, 7-6(7). Altmaier still leads their series 2-1.

Other players who advanced on the first day of the main draw were Thiago Agustin Tirante, a 7-5, 6-3 winner against Cristian Garin, and Ignacio Buse, who rallied past qualifier Igor Marcondes 4-6, 7-5, 6-4. Vit Kopriva also reached the second round with a 6-2, 7-6(5) victory against wild card Gustavo Heide.

In the only doubles match of the day, Brazilian sensation Joao Fonseca partnered countryman Marcelo Melo past alternates Roman Andres Burruchaga and Andrea Pellegrino 6-4, 6-4. It was the first tour-level doubles win of Fonseca's career.

Ahead of the 2026 Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships on media day, Coco Gauff discussed her experience currently serving as a global brand ambassador for Mercedes-Benz, the premier partner of the WTA.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- When the WTA and Mercedes-Benz announced their long-term partnership in December, World No. 4 Coco Gauff earned a unique opportunity to serve as global brand ambassador for the premier partner and exclusive automobile partner of the WTA. 

Ahead of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, Gauff highlighted the first few months of her experience with Mercedes-Benz.

"For me, it was super cool. Obviously I feel like Mercedes is a great brand, been around forever," Gauff, 21, said Sunday on media day. "They built their status on that side of the world.

"I think for me to be able to represent that at such a young age, I think is pretty cool for me. It's such a prestigious brand. I'm also happy they decided to support women's tennis and allow me be the face of that new transition for them."

Effective Jan. 1, 2026, the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz partnership began as Mercedes-Benz is now present at a variety of WTA 1000, 500 and 250 events. From fan activations to luxury tournament transport and automobile displays, the brand has been creating distinct experiences for fans, players and guests at several tournaments thus far, including in Dubai.

Gauff spent some time Monday afternoon at the Mercedes-Benz' brand activation tent in the fan zone, posing with some of the automobiles and partaking in one of the fan games. One of the tour's most popular players, she stayed to sign autographs among the swarming crowd.

"I think it's great for the tour, great for women's sports," Gauff added on Mercedes-Benz' presence. "It definitely shows we have market value. These big, prestigious brands want to get involved. I'm very happy to be representing Mercedes."

Mercedes-Benz iconic star is also displayed on the net at WTA tournaments, an addition that Gauff has noticed and taken a liking for. 

"I'm happy the tour is cool to see the little symbol on the net," Gauff said, smiling. "I'm like, 'Okay, we're moving on up.'"

From Michelangelo Antonioni's “L'avventura” to even Angelina Jolie's “By the Sea,” movies in which couples in crisis wander new terrain while also feeling like tourists in their own lives, welcome “Midwinter Break” to the club. In fact, in terms of the overall lugubriousness of Stella (Lesley Manville) and Gerry's (Ciarán Hinds) impromptu vacation to the sheer dour vibes of the chilly, gray Amsterdam weather, director Polly Findlay's new film seems to say, “Hold my Guinness.”

Though Manville and Hinds are incapable of performances that are anything less than fantastic, “Midwinter Break” serves up just about the most depressing holiday imaginable — and in a moviegoing season in which we are all already reeling from the most depressing winter ever. As for this “Midwinter Break”? More like “The Winter of Our Lives.” The script here is too stiffly restrained to a fault to make much of an emotional impact, even as spending time with these actors historically is never without pleasures.

Stella and Gerry are a long-ago empty-nested couple living in County Derry in a cozy village one would describe as being “nestled” in a nook somewhere in Ireland. Their lives, it appears, have sunken to the nadir of mundanity in retirement, with Gerry deep in his cups, boozing with a grim resolve, and Stella also not not about to bring out the wine a little too early in the day. She's also a piously devout Catholic who has given the biggest slice of her personality pie over to God; at a certain point, you are all but expecting her to pull out a whip and start repenting. 

 










It all has something to do with a vaguely foreshadowed accident she was involved in in Troubles-era Belfast several decades ago, while heavily pregnant — a cold infusion of snippets of which are administered like an IV drip throughout the movie. The type of memory flashbacks that are shot at knee level, gauzy and out of focus, with a gossamer visual touch to conjure whispering, buried emotions of the past.

Gerry, meanwhile, is about as patriotically Irish as Stella is Catholic — not just in the sense of his hard-drinking, but also with former glories of youth he's keen to share with any unsuspecting bartender who is forced to listen. He's the type of alcoholic who will take a sizable swig off a bottle in the few seconds here and there where his wife is in the next room. Stella knows she's codependent and complicit — and thus, to break the spell of another lonely Christmas (their son has opted only to phone in for the holiday) followed by another cold, lonely New Year's, Stella surprises Gerry with tickets to Amsterdam. Obviously, it's been some time since they've experienced anything adjacent to an adventure. He's instantly buoyed by the proposal, which at least eliminates “Midwinter Break” from being a movie where he's dragged abroad against his will.

Despite Gerry managing to score a bottle of whiskey somewhere, offscreen, in customs, his joie de vivre is not immediately refreshed upon arrival in Amsterdam, and neither is Stella's. It soon becomes clear that Stella may have brought Gerry there under false pretenses — whether premeditated or not — because she ends up fixating on a convent, hoping to join the local sisterhood, which would, of course, mean leaving Gerry and his liquor and his statins behind. The rhythms of Gerry's drinking problem start to get repetitive, but, alas, c'est la vie when it comes to the spinning wheel of addiction.

 










Despite the narrowness their visit's purpose acquires, “Midwinter Break” does make generous use of the city's locations, whether walking along the canals or through the De Pijp neighborhood shops or visiting the Rijksmuseum to awe at the Rembrandts. And the movie certainly looks picture-pleasant enough, as shot on location by recurring Ben Wheatley cinematographer Laurie Rose. There's also the added element of the film's leading actors, who both give expectedly committed turns in their roles — though one issue here is that the film's primarily target snowbirds-and-up audience doesn't necessarily turn out in theaters for adult-minded dramas (or anything at all) these days. “Midwinter Break” gets a lovely scene where we see septuagenarians (or one of them, anyway) sharing a moment of actual physical intimacy. But Stella and Gerry never seem to actually enjoy a minute of this “vacation,” their joylessness ultimately infecting the audience.

Manville, who is the most interesting thing about every movie she's ever played in, delivers an emotionally charged speech in which she explains why she has displaced all her life's unhappiness into dreams of the sisterhood, and onto God. Her Stella is maddeningly, frustratingly pious, especially when contrasted against her husband's secularity, until she finally opens up. It's certainly one of Manville's best performances since playing the surrogate mother to a dressmaking control freak in “Phantom Thread” or a hapless, drifting alcoholic in “Another Year” made the long-working British actress something of an item here in the States. But god, if the revelations that come out of Stella's overdue psychic purge don't make you want to catch the next plane out of Schiphol to get to anywhere but depressing here, I don't know what will.

 










“Midwinter Break” opens in theaters on Friday, February 20, from Focus Features.

Lance Hammer was the toast of the town in 2008 with his hard-hitting, Mississippi-set coming-of-age drama “Ballast.” The Dardennes-esque vérité portrait of lives careening from loss and economic hardship won two awards at the Sundance Film Festival that year — including Best Director for Hammer — and received multiple Film Independent Spirit and Gotham award nominations. 

And then, poof: Hammer was never heard from again.

He has now returned, almost two decades later, with an extremely upsetting but compassionate moral drama about agency amid dementia, titled “Queen at Sea.” It stars Juliette Binoche as a woman desperate and panicked to take care of her ailing mother, Leslie (Anna Calder-Marshall), who is slipping deeper into the illness. Leslie's grasp of time, memory, and function is vanishing in the multi-story London flat she shares with her husband of 19 years, Martin (a brutally heartbreaking Tom Courtenay). Meanwhile, Amanda (Binoche), an academic, is going through a separation herself — from her husband in Newcastle, and now she's forced to bring her daughter, Sara (Florence Hunt), with her back to London to check in on and care for her mother.

But when Amanda catches her stepfather, Martin, in a compromising position with Leslie, another separation sets into motion, with Leslie potentially about to be lost in an elder-care system that's frightening and scary for the patient, and all but a death sentence for her and her loved ones.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






As someone who's watched a close loved one lose themselves to Alzheimer's disease, I found “Queen at Sea” to be especially bruising, even despite some of its patchier plot notes. The emotions are there, even if the story is, well, lost at sea at times. The geographical configuration surrounding Amanda, having left behind a husband (and Sara's father) in Newcastle, is confusing. Meanwhile, Sara has very quickly restarted her life in Newcastle with new friends and a potential new flame, as writer/director Hammer draws parallel comparisons in the edit between Sara's blooming relationship with a classmate, and Leslie's mental deterioration and estrangement from her own partner.

When the movie begins, Amanda is on a house call to check on Leslie, and walks in on Martin attempting to have sex with a dazed-out, addled-eyed Leslie prostrate on the bed. This is not the first time this has happened, and it's an occurrence Amanda has implored Martin to knock off. But the Viagra in his medicine cabinet suggests otherwise, that he keeps going back for more, that Amanda keeps asking him to stop.

Dementia dramas like Sarah Polley's wounding “Away from Her” (wherein Julie Christie's husband Grant Anderson basically sets her up in a nursing home to counteract his own infidelities) and Michael Haneke's Oscar-winning “Amour” (the harshest of this fleet of films) tend to center close-up on the relations between an Alzheimer's patient and her partner, and how these relationships break down when there are fewer past and present memories to found them on. 

 










Hammer's film introduces profound new questions and issues about consent into the formula — is Leslie agreeing on some level to have sex with her husband? Is the only pleasure in her winnowing life to be denied? Can a person with dementia consent to having sex? Leslie's instincts now are narrowed to the primal: food, water, sleep, and, naturally, sex. So where do all these leftover feelings go when the body containing them is now only a vessel for a going mind?

Martin insists that Leslie — a once-celebrated and very talented painter now slowly going mute, mentally and emotionally and physically — is enjoying these encounters. They've been married for 19 years, after all, and when Amanda calls the police and introduces authorities into the situation, the couple is suddenly torn asunder. Then arise questions about whether they should continue to be separated and whether to place Leslie in a home.

Which is eventually what happens, and where Leslie forms an inappropriate bond with another patient to fill the Martin void. Writer/director Hammer, though, downplays the melodrama inherent to this scenario, even while shooting sequences, whether in Martin and Leslie's apartment or in various hospitals, with a bracing handheld intimacy. Far from sterilely composed, a rape kit examination forced upon Leslie is harrowing and demeaning, especially as she has no idea what's going on and no clue why a speculum is being inserted into her. In what world could Martin have raped his wife?

 










Binoche, who has been giving committed and emotionally messy but always focused performances for years lately, including in films by Haneke, gives one of her best recent turns in “Queen at Sea.” An emotional phone call to her soon-to-be ex-husband shows blanched vulnerability as she dials the last person she would prefer not to call, but the one she is forced to call anyway. Interior lives outside those determined by this situation may be lacking, but Leslie's isn't. Amanda's mother seems to activate when given the chance to paint at a nursing home, an aseptic and terrible place for which everyone in the family seems to be awkwardly auditioning.

The great British actor Courtenay, most recently memorable in the similarly memory-impaired marriage portrait “45 Years” opposite Charlotte Rampling, is quite devastating as a husband scrambling for answers and to legitimize his own place in Leslie's life. The one element that doesn't quite land, and seems quite literally chopped into the film, is Florence Hunt as Amanda's daughter. Hammer seems to be trying to signal that she may be headed for her own future mental ruin by intercutting her first romance with scenes of Martin and Leslie's last. It's a noble idea, but it ends up feeling like scraps from an earlier draft.

Ultimately, though, anyone who's endured what Amanda, or Leslie, or Martin do in this movie will find something to relate to and feel toward. Hammer spares no hard truths and offers no pat feelings with regard to how these people are bound to end up and what dementia ultimately does to them. Let's just say hope is at a shortage. But the actors help carry Hammer's message — and make it unforgettable.

 










“Queen at Sea” premiered at the 2026 Berlin Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

The actor had been on an extended weekend bar crawl since Thursday.

Deputy Editor, East Coast


Shia LaBeouf‘s Mardi Gras bar crawl has come to an unfortunate end.


	The actor was arrested shortly after midnight Tuesday in New Orleans after he allegedly fought with two men, who told police he assaulted them.




	According to the New Orleans Police Department, LaBeouf was allegedly causing a disturbance and becoming increasingly aggressive at a business, which TMZ reported was a bar, on Royal Street.


The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed that the incident took place at R Bar in the Faubourg Marigny, where on Monday evenings you can get a haircut and a shot for $20.

	A staff member attempted to eject LaBeouf from R Bar, but after he was removed from the building, LaBeouf allegedly hit one man several times with closed fists.


	He then, according to the police report, left but came back, allegedly acting more aggressive.


	After multiple people attempted to hold him down, LaBeouf was let up, the police report states, “in hopes that he would leave,” but he then allegedly resumed hitting the same man who he allegedly punched earlier.


	He then allegedly punched another person in the nose and was held down until the police arrived.


	LaBeouf was taken to a hospital for unknown injuries and then arrested and charged with two counts of simple battery.


	The arrest comes after LaBeouf, who recently claimed to be sober and blamed past abusive behavior on alcoholism, went on an extended-weekend bar crawl during Mardi Gras in New Orleans' Uptown neighborhood, according to employees of various drinking establishments.


	He showed up at 24/7 bar Ms Mae's, around the time the Bacchus super-krewe parade rolled up St. Charles Avenue with thousands of revelers, in what the establishment's doorman said was an “inebriated” state and “somewhat belligerent.” He was also without cash or a shirt, putting the latter back on when he was told he had to. He had visited the same establishment on Thursday. But on Sunday, the doorman said, “He did the ‘Do you know who I am?' bit” and begrudingly left without incident after he attempted to “be a celebrity bartender” and was asked to leave.

	











	Another bartender, who waited on him last Thursday, said, “He is terrorizing the city!” He was spotted at at least two other bars in the city and was telling people he was staying at a luxury Airbnb.


Feb. 17, 10:32 a.m. This story has been updated with the bar where this incident took place.

Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band are bringing their politically charged Land of Hope and Dreams tour to North America in the spring for a run of arena and stadium dates. It kicks off March 31 in Minneapolis at the Target Center, and wraps up May 27 at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. Ticket sales start on Friday.


	“We are living through dark, disturbing and dangerous times, but do not despair — the cavalry is coming!” Springsteen says in a statement. “Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band will be taking the stage this spring from Minneapolis to California to Texas to Washington, D.C. for the Land of Hope And Dreams American Tour. We will be rocking your town in celebration and in defense of America — American democracy, American freedom, our American Constitution and our sacred American dream — all of which are under attack by our wannabe king and his rogue government in Washington, D.C. Everyone, regardless of where you stand or what you believe in, is welcome — so come on out and join the United Free Republic of E Street Nation for an American spring of Rock ‘n' Rebellion! I'll see you there!” 

	











	Last summer, Springsteen and the E Street Band played stadiums in Europe on the initial leg of the Land of Hope and Dreams Tour. “The mighty E Street Band is here tonight to call upon the righteous power of art, of music, of rock & roll, in dangerous times,” he told the crowd on opening night. “In my home, the America I love, the America I've written about, and has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration. Tonight, we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experience to rise with us, raise your voices against the authoritarianism, and let freedom ring. This is ‘Land of Hope and Dreams.'”


	This took place before Donald Trump flooded Minneapolis with ICE officers, resulting in the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. Springsteen responded to the tragedies with the protest song “Streets of Minneapolis,” which he performed Jan. 30 during a surprise appearance at Tom Morello's A Concert of Solidarity & Resistance to Defend Minnesota! at the Minneapolis club First Avenue.

	Earlier that month, Springsteen made a guest appearance at the annual Light of Days benefit concert. “Right now we are living through incredibly critical times,” he said that night. “The United States, the ideals and the value for which it stood for the past 250 years, is being tested like it has never been in modern times. Those values and those ideals have never been as endangered as they are right now.”


	“If you believe in the power of law and that no one stands above it,” he continued, “if you stand against heavily-armed masked federal troops invading an American city, using gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens, if you believe you don't deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president, as the mayor of the city said: ICE should get the fuck out of Minneapolis.”


	If Springsteen sticks to roughly the same set as Europe last summer, expect plenty of politically-themed songs like “Rainmaker,” “Long Walk Home,” and Bob Dylan's “Chimes of Freedom.” It's also a near-certainty he'll play “Streets of Minneapolis” as well.  The routing itself sends a message by beginning in Minneapolis and wrapping up near Trump's backyard in D.C.

Hey, Pedro Pascal! There you are! We so rarely get to see the superstar in “The Mandalorian,” it's certainly nice to see his actual face in our first full look at its upcoming film sequel, “The Mandalorian and Grogu.” (Yes, don't worry, “Baby Yoda” is there, too.)

The new film sees Pascal reprise his eponymous role from the Disney+ series, with his adorable sidekick and charming ward Grogu, AKA “Baby Yoda,” now receiving top billing, too. Other cast members include Sigourney Weaver, Jonny Coyne, and Jeremy Allen White. (And, for keen-eared film freaks, is that Martin Scorsese we hear as a rattled merchant early in this new look?)

Here's the logline: “The evil Empire has fallen, and Imperial warlords remain scattered throughout the galaxy. As the fledgling New Republic works to protect everything the Rebellion fought for, they have enlisted the help of legendary Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) and his young apprentice Grogu.”




			Popular on IndieWire		






The trailer follows a relatively short (and oddly Budweiser commercial-coded) teaser from Super Bowl Sunday, and leans way into the star power of not just Pascal and his tiny little pal (real question: when is Grogu hitting a growth spurt?), but other friendly faces, from a tiny “Baby Greedo” to a cadre of brave Anzellans. In short: cute!

 










“The Mandalorian and Grogu” is directed by Jon Favreau. It's his first film behind the camera since 2019's remake of “The Lion King,” though Favreau has spent much of those seven years working on various “Star Wars” TV projects. He created both “The Mandalorian” and “The Book of Boba Fett,” served as an executive producer on “Ahsoka” and “Skeleton Crew,” as well as co-wrote the new film with Filoni, who also serves as an executive producer.

The film will be the first “Star Wars” joint to arrive in theaters after the recent departure of longtime Lucasfilm head Kathleen Kennedy and the first new film in the franchise to be released since 2019's “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.” The studio is also currently at work on “Starfighter” starring Ryan Gosling, which will open in 2027. Several other prospective films however with a revolving door of talent have started and stopped over recent years.

Disney will release “The Mandalorian and Grogu” in theaters on Friday, May 22. Check out the film's first full trailer below.

EXCLUSIVE: Walton Goggins (The White Lotus) has come aboard to lead action-comedy Mister from Bright White Light and John Wick outfit Thunder Road. Chloë Grace Moretz (Kick-Ass) will co-star.


	As we previously reported, the film will mark the directorial debut of well known second unit and action director Wade Eastwood, whose credits include Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, Mission: Impossible – Fallout and Jumanji: The Next Level. 


	Josh Brolin had been formerly aboard to star but has had to bow out due to unforeseen scheduling issues. Filming gets underway next month in Madrid.

Mister “follows a man (Goggins) who wakes up in a strange house covered in blood and comes to realize his true identity while fighting off contract killers from his past — including everyone from his exes to his best friend. To get out, he teams up with his estranged daughter (Moretz) who also has ended up in the family business, but they will need to repair their relationship in order to survive”. Additional casting is in process.


	Basil Iwanyk and Erica Lee produce for Thunder Road alongside Goggins. Nicki Cortese, who also penned the script with Nick Inglis, will produce with Wayne Marc Godfrey for Bright White Light (Runner), which also is financing the film.


	Executive producers include Chase Vergari, Ibrahim Mohammed, Eric Handler, Will Flynn, and Sophie Meyer who will oversee for Bright White Light. Black Bear represents international rights on the film, with CAA Media Finance handling domestic. 


	The A-list crew includes DoP Henry Braham (Superman) and production designer Nigel Phelps (Thor: Love And Thunder).


Justified and The Hateful Eight star Goggins was recently Emmy and Golden Globe nominated for his performance in The White Lotus. He is due to start filming the third season of hit Amazon show Fallout later this year. 


Kick-Ass and The Equalizer star Moretz will next be seen in rom-com Love Language, and thriller The Edge Of Normal, the first English-language feature from director Carlota Pereda (Piggy). She recently returned to the stage in the off-Broadway play Caroline.

	











	Producer Basil Iwanyk told Deadline: “Walton and Chloë are the perfect pairing to capture Mister's heart and humor — while delivering some of the most ambitious and wildly entertaining action sequences audiences will see on screen this year.”


	Director Wade Eastwood told us: “From our first conversations, I knew Walton would bring an unpredictable spark you simply can't manufacture — he's electric. Chloë brings an incredible mix of strength, vulnerability and razor-sharp timing. Together, they make Mister exactly what we set out to create: bold, funny and completely full-throttle.”


	Goggins is repped by CAA and Darris Hatch Management. Moretz is represented by CAA and Sloane, Offer.

A few years ago, agents Pete Franciosa and Mike Rubi got a call looking to see if a Hollywood production designer was available for a job in Ohio. A retiree was looking to transform his entire, 2,000 square foot basement into a replica of the interior of the Death Star, and he wanted a real professional to help do it.

Perhaps incredibly, Franciosa and Rubi did not immediately hang up the phone.

Franciosa and Rubi are the heads of United Talent Agency's Production Arts division, where they've been in charge since 2013. The division at UTA is responsible for repping top crafts talent, including cinematographer Roger Deakins, “Dune” production designer Patrice Vermette, “The Smashing Machine” makeup designer Kazu Hiro, “Andor” costume designer Michael Wilkinson, and many, many more. Like any agent, they negotiate film and TV jobs for their talent. But it's also been the duo's philosophy to look outside the box, away from Hollywood and into other realms that aren't exclusively for entertainment.

So when a job offer like the Ohio Death Star comes their way, they listen. That one didn't pan out, and they didn't disclose whom would've been the lucky Oscar winner to travel to some guy's basement in the Midwest. But it's just one of many opportunities that Franciosa and Rubi are fielding for their clients beyond work that could win them Oscars.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“God, that would have been a magical project,” Franciosa told IndieWire. “It was smart, film-based, and deeply meaningful — both to the designer and to the client who wanted it built. I love ideas like that. And frankly, I hope more of them keep coming. It's imaginative, it's personal, and it's exactly the kind of creative challenge our clients thrive on.”

Rubi is quick to chime in that for every one of those wacky ideas, there are 10 more that are far more practical, like building a New York City backlot set for a film studio in Sri Lanka. It's different, but not completely far afield. He explains that there's the pragmatic aspect of keeping a client employed in between movies, but there's also the perk of giving acclaimed artists the chance to stretch their art and reputation further around the globe. 

“These are sophisticated, high-level business leaders in their own right,” Rubi said. “When they come to us, it's because they have the ability to work with anyone in the world — and they choose our clients because they have a genuine affinity for the artistry and craftsmanship these designers bring. There's real respect for the work.”

In some cases, Production Arts' vision has been to elevate its clients to the next level. Jeremy Hindle, an Emmy-winning production designer on “Severance” during its first season, graduated to being a producer on the second season of the Apple TV series. Others have become directors or gone from indies to studio films and series. 

 










But in other cases, Production Arts has managed to leverage its connections to UTA's other divisions to find them opportunities. Deakins recently parlayed his visual acumen into a book called “Reflections.” One producer client of UTA's is in the midst of launching a podcast based on stories from the world of movie making. And Vermette is in the midst of designing a hotel resort with a company called Mohari Hospitality. 

For Vermette, this is actually the second hotel he's now designing. The first was a collaboration in Saudi Arabia with a French Moroccan architect, one he completed in between “Dune: Part 2” and the upcoming third “Dune” film, and this new one, the location of which he's not yet able to disclose, he took on after the third “Dune” wrapped. 

Vermette told IndieWire that though he wants to “die on a movie set,” he loves being able to tell stories in any setting, and he'd love to expand his craft to help design industrial spaces, to work on cars, furniture, or even do something in the live space after he was inspired by Bad Bunny's Super Bowl Halftime performance. 

“I'm a passionate person, and I'm curious, and I thrive for a different experience,” Vermette said. “I think one hopefully will feed the other. My film experience, it will feed, whether it's hospitality or an event, and then what I'll learn by the collaborations I have on these projects, that will feed me for the film.” 

 










After working with a number of legendary cinematographers, he's learned the importance of light to a physical space, even a hotel. For instance, he's designing the hotel's corridor such that when the light hits the space at different times of day, it gives a new experience each time you pass through it.

“For production designers, we use our instincts and our eyes in our work in film,” Vermette said. “I think that could be beneficial for other fields as well. Everybody could benefit from being more flexible.” 

For some artists, finding other opportunities may be a matter of necessity. Los Angeles ended 2025 with 16 percent fewer shoot days than in 2024, according to the most recent numbers from FilmLA. Back in 2024, we spoke with below the line workers who don't have the name recognition of some of UTA's top clients, and they found themselves installing light fixtures in conference rooms or Jumbotrons in college arenas. 

These odd jobs aren't a replacement for the real thing in the absence of local film productions, but they keep clients busy and help elevate their reputation in other ways. Franciosa said when it comes to “below the line” professionals, just by their name, they are inherently undervalued artists in the industry. The idea of Production Arts is that for their clients, none of them are “below” anything.

 










“Artists are artists — they don't live in a singular box. They break walls and ceilings. Andy Warhol is a great example: he didn't think in limiting creative terms, and there was no ceiling on what he could do,” Franciosa said. “That's the spirit behind this division. You may be a cinematographer, a production designer, or a costume designer, but your specialty shouldn't define the limits of your creativity. We represent artists in a way that allows them to do their most creative work, regardless of category. If their imagination has no limits, their opportunities shouldn't either.”

“Every artist is different. The cachet they hold within the creative community takes a different form in each case,” Rubi added. “But the through line is this — every time someone successfully expands into a new arena, it strengthens the broader effort and creates momentum. Each success opens the door to the next opportunity.”

Nicole Kidman is said to have a new suitor just weeks after finalizing her divorce from Keith Urban.

Multimillionaire businessman Paul Salem is romantically pursuing the 58-year-old “Babygirl” star, several sources familiar with the matter told TMZ on Monday.

Insiders told the outlet that Salem, who serves as the Chairman of the Board for MGM Resorts International, is interested in the Oscar-winner and has made that known to the people closest to him.

Although Kidman and the wealthy businessman, 62, reportedly share two mutual friends and have mingled twice in group settings, sources clarified that they are not dating and have not spent time together one-on-one.

Like the “Eyes Wide Shut” star, Salem is a divorcee. He and his ex-wife, Navyn Salem, reportedly split in 2021.

Kidman's reps have not immediately returned Page Six's request for comment.

Reports that Salem is romantically pursuing Kidman come just one month after the “Big Little Lies” star and Urban, 58, finalized their divorce on Jan. 6.

The former couple, who tied the knot in June 2006, announced that they were separating in September 2025.

“Sometimes relationships just run their course,” a source told Page Six at the time, adding that Kidman “did not want the separation and was trying to save things.”

She officially filed for divorce from the country rocker on Sept. 30, citing “irreconcilable differences.”

The exes share daughters Sunday Rose, 17, and Faith Margaret, 15.

“Nicole spends a lot of time with her girls,” a source told People last month. “She loves family time.”

“She is refreshed and optimistic about the new year,” the insider also shared before adding that the newly single actress is “looking ahead to a busy and exciting year professionally too, with several projects coming up.”

As for Urban, he has since been romantically linked to both his 25-year-old guitarist, Maggie Baugh, and the up-and-coming country singer Karley Scott Collins.

While those romance rumors were ultimately dismissed by Collins and a close friend of Baugh's, an insider claimed that Urban had moved in with a new love interest last month.

“I hear he has someone, which is why the girls are publicly supporting Mom,” the source alleged to the Daily Mail last month.

“People think they are even living together,” the insider added. “Look, teen girls love their dads, so there's a reason they're making it three against one.”

The superstar scores his second leader and tackles the top 10 with four songs.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



Bad Bunny's “DtMF” hits No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the superstar's second leader on the list, and first on his own. He previously reigned with “I Like It,” with Cardi B and J Balvin, for a week in July 2018.


	“DtMF” blitzes 10-1 on the Hot 100 following Bad Bunny's Super Bowl LX halftime show spotlight Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, Calif., with “DtMF” the closing song in the set.


	(Notably, Bad Bunny has performed both of his Hot 100 No. 1s at the midpoint of the NFL championship game: he guested on “I Like It” during Shakira's Super Bowl LIV halftime show in 2020.)


	The Spanish-language “DtMF,” which originally reached No. 2 on the Hot 100 in January 2025, heads up four Bad Bunny songs, all of which he performed at the Super Bowl, in the top 10, with two others likewise from his 2025 album Debí Tirar Más Fotos: “Baile Inolvidable,” which bounds 19-2 for a new high, and “Nuevayol,” up 28-5, also a new best. Plus, “Tití Me Preguntó,” from his 2022 LP Un Verano Sin Ti, reenters the chart at No. 7 (after hitting No. 5 that year).


	Check out the full rundown of this week's Hot 100 top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Feb. 21, 2026) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Feb. 18 (one day later than usual due to the Presidents' Day holiday in the United States Feb. 16).

Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.




	“DtMF” — on the Rimas label, which leads the Hot 100 for the first time — drew 43 million official streams (up 85% week over week) and 5.3 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 56%) and sold 12,000 (up 262%) in the U.S. Feb. 6-12.


	The single surges 4-1 for a third week atop the Streaming Songs chart, after it led for two weeks in January-February 2025, and bounds 11-2 for a new high on Digital Song Sales.


	The streaming sum of 43 million for “DtMF” marks the highest for a song so far in 2026. It's also the top weekly total for the song, which previously peaked with 34.9 million in its first week at No. 1 on Streaming Songs. Plus, it achieves the top streaming week for a song not primarily in English this decade, surpassing its prior best (which bested the 34.6 million tallied by Eslabón Armado and Peso Pluma's “Ella Baila Sola” in May 2023).


	“DtMF” is the fourth all- or mostly-Spanish-language Hot 100 No. 1, and the first by a soloist and no other billed acts, dating to the chart's 1958 inception. Here are the elite such leaders:




	“DtMF” is the first Hot 100 No. 1 with any portion of its lyrics not in English since HUNTR/X's “Golden, with sections in Korean among its mostly-English lyrics, led for eight weeks last August-October.


	Some more X's and O's as “DtMF” barrels into the Hot 100's end zone: It's the second song in as many years to top the chart following a Super Bowl halftime show performance. On the Feb. 22, 2025, list, Kendrick Lamar scored a gain of 14 as “Not Like Us” rebounded 15-1 for a third week atop the tally. He also claimed half the top 10 that week.


	Here's a summary of the totals, and metric increases, for Bad Bunny's four concurrent top 10s on the latest Hot 100:




	Bad Bunny boasts four simultaneous Hot 100 top 10s for a second time, following his haul on the May 21, 2022, chart — when “Tití Me Preguntó” debuted — as Un Verano Sin Ti launched at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.


	“DtMF” holds for a 47th week at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Latin Songs chart, where it's one of Bad Bunny's 17 leaders. Only “Despacito” (56 weeks) has dominated longer since the survey began in October 1986.


	Olivia Dean's “Man I Need” dips to No. 3 from its No. 2 Hot 100 high, as it adds a third week at No. 1 on the Radio Songs chart (63.3 million, down 4%).


	Ella Langley's “Choosin' Texas” falls to No. 4 a week after it became her first Hot 100 No. 1. It tops the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart for a 12th frame.


	Alex Warren's “Ordinary” backtracks 3-6 on the Hot 100 after 10 weeks at No. 1 beginning last June.

Following Gregg Araki's “I Want Your Sex” and Cathy Yan's “The Gallerist,” which both premiered at this year's Sundance Film Festival to mixed results, Geneviève Dulude-De Celles' “Nina Roza” is the latest 2026 film to take a swipe at the absurdities of the contemporary art world. Though instead of relying on the scandalous machinations of satire, as the Sundance titles did, this one pivots to and later works in service of the meditative allure of grief and memory drama.

Shot and set between Canada and Bulgaria, it's the follow-up to the Montreal-based director's first fiction feature, “A Colony,” which won the Crystal Bear in 2019. Like that film and the rest of her oeuvre, her latest is another tender tale of a protagonist stuck between two worlds, a hallmark motif fitting for a director who splits her time between documentary and fiction filmmaking.

The film's title reflects that “idea of the double,” featuring two women who seem enigmatically one and the same to the unmoored protagonist, art curator Mihail, played by Galin Stoev. One is an eight-year-old Bulgarian painting prodigy named Nina, alternately played by twins Sofia and Ekatarina Stanina; the other is Mihail's daughter Roza (Michelle Tzontchev) who's currently staying with him alongside her young son Thomas (Raphaël Fournier), after feeling adrift from the child's father. Through the stark similarities and differences between the two women, “Nina Roza” finds an apt symbolism for Mihail's past and present and search for belongingness, but it's unfair to suggest that Dulude-De Celles merely renders both women as a cipher for the protagonist and the viewer.

 










Mihail has kept both worlds firmly separate for nearly three decades since living in permanent exile in Montreal with Roza after the demise of his Bulgarian wife, so much so that he has become a Sofian who “thinks in French.” When Roza plays her mom's favorite music or insists on teaching her Quebec-born son to speak Bulgarian, it irritates him. The Balkan country is a “backward place,” he tells the curious boy. It's no surprise, then, that upon learning about the viral paintings of a rural Bulgarian village girl, who has repurposed a livestock barn into a studio, he almost instantly assumes it's a fraud. (Nina's trending story, which sets the movie into motion, takes its cue from the real-life story of Australian child prodigy Aelita Andre.) Soon, Mihail travels to Bulgaria to confirm his seemingly logical assumption, only to discover answers he didn't intend to seek and more questions about the double life he's leading and his fractured relationship with Roza, who was the same age as Nina when they fled Bulgaria together.

Though the legitimacy of Nina's abstract work (painted in real life by Montreal artist Aujeault) eventually snaps into focus, “Nina Roza” is much less drawn to solving the suspicion than to heightening the inescapable overlap between former and current lives, between dream and reality, in the context of grief and belated recollections, allowing for a hypnotic, plot-averse memory piece akin to many an Alice Rohrwacher movie. Other textures considered, Dulude-De Celles also fashions a film about exile and estrangement and sacrificing one's identity in pursuit of self-preservation, about what a place can do to people.

 










Whereas the film anonymizes its Canadian setting, given it's mostly presented through interior shots, cinematographer Alexandre Nour Desjardins shoots Bulgaria in a manner that feels at once poetic and purgatorial, and maximizes the scenic beauty of the countryside, with a camera that would rather move than keep still. The overall palette is subdued, steeped in vintage brown, which gives Dulude-De Celles' present-day story a timeless quality. Sun-drenched shots of Mihail, often zoned out or half-asleep in transit, evoke an elusive inner world the director is trying to access and intimate, in much the same way as the film's hazy moments, captured by an anamorphic lens, yield a transportive effect. There is a sense that the filmmaker is deliberately slowing down the central character's experience of the present and therefore that of the audience.

Then there's composer Joseph Marchand's meaningful mix of a generally dreamlike score, alongside ‘70s Bulgarian estrada, featuring Pasha Hristova's “Edna Bulgarska Roza” and “Povei Vetre,” and traditional Bulgarian folk music, like Petar Lyondev's widely popular arrangement of “Ergen Deda,” which is much less concerned with ennobling the proceedings than it is with reflecting Mihail's disassociation and forced contact with the specters of his past — one of the rare occasions where anachronistic needle drops actually elevate a film rather than kneecap it.

 










However, the film's critique of the art world only decidedly crystallizes when Chiara Caselli's Giulia, the Italian gallery owner representing Nina, shows up over an hour into the 104-minute movie. Recognizing that she can only play the prodigy card to sell Nina's work for so long, Giulia claims to give the child's mother an “excellent cause” to emigrate to Italy and practically forge a new life with her daughter in the foreign land. But when Mihail, feeling obliged to protect Nina, pries about the art dealer's real motives and whether she actually cares about the young artist's approval, Giulia merely couches her plan in terms of “helping them.” “Her mother came to me, not the other way around,” she asserts, pretending to be oblivious to the power dynamics between her and the women she claims to help.

The deceptively doting gallerist sees the girl as nothing but an investment, and all the predatory scheming is not lost on the precocious Nina, who'd rather prefer a pastoral life in the company of her friends and family, all artists themselves, to Italy's Next Great Painter, thus rejecting the solitary artist mystique. Nina sort of hurls the question of authenticity back to the foreign tastemakers hot on her heels. In this respect, “Nina Roza” can certainly be read as a commentary on tokenism, forced migration, and commodity in the modern art industry. A montage near the coda shows logistics workers carefully handling, labeling, and transporting Nina's paintings for the forthcoming exhibit thousands of miles away, and you begin to wonder whether gallerists, collectors, and curators value their artists the same way they value their works or the stories that brought forth such invaluable art. It's an adequate critique, one that I do wish the languidly paced movie foregrounded a little bit more.

 










Stoev and the Stanina twins (whom I hardly notice as two separate actors, let alone twins) are basically brilliant; they act as if it's not their first time sharing the screen together. Stoev's expressively melancholic visage recalls that of the recently late Iranian legend Homayoun Ershadi in “Taste of Cherry.” The movie is at its most potent when it simply observes Stoev interfacing with the local villagers, most especially the unassumingly funny Nikolay Mutafchiev, who plays Nina's uncle. Here and nowhere else, Mihail experiences the sacred bond of community, of what it means to primally connect with people, in hopes of learning to be gentle with oneself.

Like the eponymous gifted girl's paintings, “Nina Roza” is subtly cosmic, compelling, and impressionistic. It powerfully commits to symbolic, time-shifting flourishes scattered throughout its swerving narrative. It is a work of legitimate form.

“Nina Roza” premiered at the 2026 Berlin Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Din Djarin is back with some new little puppets and big CGI monsters. Disney shared a new trailer this morning for the upcoming Star Wars flick (not the one you may have seen in theaters ahead of Wuthering Heights this weekend) which sees the titular Mandalorian making his way through the gangsters, war criminals, and generally bad guys on his list. Of course, Grogu is also along for the ride, and this time even gets star billing in the title of the film. 

“This isn't about revenge,” says Ward (Sigourney Weaver). “It's about preventing another war.” Good luck with that—this is Disney's Star Wars. There will always be another war. But Din is most concerned about protecting Grogu, instructing him to check his armor and coping with some existential, very parental dread. “The kid will live centuries beyond me,” he says. “I won't always be around to protect him.” He's not the only one with this on his mind; we also get a glimpse of a fleeing baby Greedo, who probably isn't actually named Baby Greedo but is just a juvenile Rodian. 



Aside from Pedro Pascal as Din Djarin and Weaver, Jeremy Allen White will also star in The Mandalorian And Grogo as Ratta the Hutt. Jon Favreau directs. The Mandalorian And Grogu will open in movie theaters and IMAX on May 22.

Last week, the FCC reportedly began following through on their threats to start poking around at The View after the talk show hosted Texas senatorial candidate James Talarico. Apparently CBS, despite their thirst for scoops, wanted desperately to avoid the same potential smoke. “You know who's not here tonight? That's Texas state rep James Talarico,” Stephen Colbert said on The Late Show last night. “He was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers directly that we could not have him on the broadcast. Then, I was told, in some uncertain terms, that not only could I not have him on, I couldn't mention me not having him on. And, because my network clearly doesn't want us to talk about this, let's talk about this.”

Talking about that good ol' equal time rule, Colbert joked, “It's the FCC's most time honored rule, after no nipples at the Super Bowl.” He went on, “Let's just call this what it is: Donald Trump's administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV, because all Trump does is watch TV, okay? He's like a toddler with too much screen time; he gets cranky and drops a load in his diaper. So, it's no surprise that two of the people most affected by this threat are me and my friend Jimmy Kimmel.” Since FCC head Brendan Carr had previously said they should conduct these interviews elsewhere, Colbert said that he'd be posting the interview with Talarico on The Late Show‘s YouTube page, which he did do. “The network says I can't give you a URL or a QR code, but I promise you, you go to our YouTube page, you'll find it.” (You can also find it here.) 

As Colbert goes on to point out, Carr's jurisdiction is not just broadcast TV but radio, but has declined to enforce any equal time rules that might apply to the vast ecosystem of right-wing talk radio. “I get this part, it makes sense. You can't get rid of talk radio. What else would your angriest uncle do in traffic? Talk to your saddest aunt?” Colbert quipped. In any case, the exception for late night talk shows hasn't been done away with yet. “But my network is unilaterally enforcing it as if he had. But ladies and gentlemen, I want to assure you, that this decision is for purely financial reasons.” You can watch the whole segment below.

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: All aboard! A Ticket to Ride movie is in development at Netflix, which has locked down exclusive global rights to Asmodee's popular railway-themed board game.


	This comes following their acquisition of similar rights to the publisher's other hit game, Catan.


Ben Mekler and Chris Amick are penning the feature, with Darren Kyman set to produce for Asmodee, alongside Eric Tannenbaum and Kim Tannenbaum for the Tannenbaum Company, and Jonathan Levine and Gillian Bohrer for Megamix. Alan R. Moon, author of the game, will executive produce on behalf of Asmodee.

	Mel McClelland, VP of the Tannenbaum Company, and McAuley Cahill, VP of Megamix, developed the feature concept from scratch alongside Mekler and Amick.

	Netflix's deal for Ticket to Ride spans both scripted and unscripted arenas, and thus would also allow for projects in television and other formats. Should the film from Mekler and Amick make it to screens first, it'll be the first on-screen adaptation of the game.


	Becoming a pop culture staple since its 2004 launch, Ticket to Ride has sold over 20 million copies and been translated into more than 30 languages. The game has players collect colored train cards with an eye toward claiming railway routes connecting cities on a map — whether of the U.S., Europe, or what have you. The longer the route, the more points you score.


	“Just when I thought life couldn't get more exciting, Ticket to Ride is teaming up with Netflix,” said Moon. “I can't wait to help bring these exciting projects to the millions of fans of the game.”

	











	At Netflix, Ticket to Ride joins a growing portfolio of game-to-screen adaptations, including Arcane, Castlevania, Family Pack (The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow), Exploding Kittens, the upcoming Assassin's Creed series and Monopoly reality competition series, along with a new Gears of War film.


	The deal was negotiated by CAA and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman on behalf of Asmodee. Mekler and Amick are repped by Good Fear Content and CAA. Amick is also with Ziffren Brittenham.

His family said he “died peacefully on Tuesday morning, surrounded by his family."

Global Business Editor


	The Reverend Jesse Jackson, a widely respected U.S. civil rights leader, has died at the age 84. His family said in a statement that Jackson “died peacefully on Tuesday morning, surrounded by his family.”


	He rose to prominence in the 1960s as a leader in Martin Luther King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Jackson was actually present when King was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., in 1968.




	That year, he was ordained a minister. Later, he was awarded a Master of Divinity degree by Chicago Theological Seminary in 2000, based on a mix of earned credits and his work and life experience.

	Jackson later launched two social justice and activism organisations. In 1971, he founded Operation PUSH, followed in 1984 by the National Rainbow Coalition, which merged with PUSH in 1996.

	While known for his civil rights activism, Jackson also ran for president in 1984, becoming the second African American to do so after Shirley Chisholm. He was a candidate for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination that year and again in 1988, but didn't win the nomination.


In 2017, at Cannes Lions, Jackson called out Hollywood and Silicon Valley for their lack of diversity and pushed the audience — made up mostly of advertisers and marketers — to use their media reach to promote positive messages for women, people of color and the LGBTQ community. 

	











	Jackson's high-profile work also attracted the entertainment industry's attention in other ways. Actors who have portrayed Jackson on screen include Nigel Gibbs in the TV series Monster (2022), and Eddie Murphy famously parodied Jackson on Saturday Night Live in 1984. Plus, the Reverend appeared as himself in a 1989 episode of A Different World.


	In 2017, Jackson was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. He was hospitalized in November after being diagnosed with a degenerative condition.


	“It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of Civil Rights leader and founder of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the Honorable Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson, Sr.,” the Jackson family statement said. “He died peacefully on Tuesday morning, surrounded by his family. His unwavering commitment to justice, equality, and human rights helped shape a global movement for freedom and dignity. A tireless change agent, he elevated the voices of the voiceless from his Presidential campaigns in the 1980s to mobilising millions to register to vote – leaving an indelible mark on history.”


	It continued: “Reverend Jackson is survived by his wife, Jacqueline; their children – Santita, Jesse Jr., Jonathan, Yusef, Jacqueline; daughter Ashley Jackson, and grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his mother, Helen Burns Jackson; father, Noah Louis Robinson; and stepfather, Charles Henry Jackson.” Concluded the family statement: “Our father was a servant leader – not only to our family, but to the oppressed, the voiceless, and the overlooked around the world. We shared him with the world, and in return, the world became part of our extended family. His unwavering belief in justice, equality, and love uplifted millions, and we ask you to honour his memory by continuing the fight for the values he lived by.' Public observances will be held in Chicago. Final arrangements for Reverend Jackson's celebration of life services, including all public events, will be released by the Rainbow PUSH Coalition.”

Mr. Worldwide will hit the stage for the gig on July 20 in London.

	Gil Kaufman



	If you've been to a Pitbull show over the past couple years you may have noticed that Mr. Worldwide's signature bald n' bearded look is catching on among his fans, male and female. He even acknowledged the trend during a run of arena shows in the U.K. and Ireland last year, where he stared out at a sea of people dressed in black suits, bald caps and sunglasses meeting up outside of venues.

	Pitbull (born Armando Christian Pérez), shared with the BBC that thought the long-running trend filled his heart, telling the outlet, “every time I'm at a show, I let them know that when you put on a bald cap, I hope you're ready to have the time of your lives – it feels deeper than just music. It's the ultimate trophy to be able to go on stage and see all the hard work that you put into the music. I've been in the game for 25 years and to see every demographic, everybody [dressing up] at the shows is priceless.”


	Now Pitbill is turning the trend into a Guinness World Record book try when he'll attempt to set a record for the most people wearing bald caps at his BST Hyde Park headlining show in London on July 10.


	Organizers announced the attempt on Tuesday morning (Feb. 17), writing on X, “It's official. Let's make history. After the idea was championed by @gregjames on @BBCR1, we're on a mission to secure a GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS™ title for the largest gathering of people wearing bald caps and Pitbull needs YOU there in London's Hyde Park on Friday 10 July. Let's have a real good time! Dale.”

	











	Pitbull will gear up for the record attempt with a series of upcoming shows, including an appearance at the Stagecoach Music Festival in Indio, Calif. (April 24-26), followed by a run of shows in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Texas, Arizona, Utah and California before heading to Europe on June 23.

The "Pretty & Petty" MC and the NFL star unfollowed each other after Diggs' New England Patriots were blown out in Super Bowl LX earlier this month.

Cardi B has not said much to date about her reported break-up with NFL wide receiver Stefon Diggs of the New England Patriots. But during one of her Little Miss Drama tour stops in Los Angeles on Sunday night (Feb. 15), the rapper seemed to open up about the couple's split, less than four months after Cardi gave birth to their son in November.

	“Just because I ain't f–ling with my baby daddy doesn't mean you get to talk about my baby daddy,” Cardi said during the show according to video of the comment. She then added a pointed, “this is for you b–ch,” before moving into her Am I the Drama? song “Pretty & Petty.” The diss track aimed at rapper BIA and came just days after BIA hopped online and appeared to take a swipe at Diggs, whose Patriots were blown out 29-13 by the Seattle Seahawks at Super Bowl LX earlier this month.

	“Can u name someone with more [baby mamas] than receiving yards,” BIA wrote on X on Thursday. “I can! and I know that… ykwnvm.” 


	Rumors that Cardi and Diggs had broken up after a year of dating —they reportedly began seeing each other in October 2024 and went official in June of last year — began to bubble up after the rapper was asked if she had a pre-game message for Diggs and she flatly replied, “Good luck” and then fans noticed that the two had unfollowed each other on Instagram. The speculation ramped up again after Cardi left the game early after her surprise cameo in Bad Bunny's historic halftime show.

	











BIA told Hot 97 last year that the origins of the two MC's issues stemmed from fans noticing that BIA's Really Her EP from 2023 and Cardi's “Enough (Miami)” track the following year had a similar groove. BIA dissed Cardi on her “Sue Me” track in 2024, with Cardi responding on “Pretty & Petty.”


	Cardi's tour will hit Portland's Moda Center on Thursday (Feb. 19).

	Rev. Jesse Jackson, the towering civil rights activist and religious leader who worked to improve economic conditions for Black communities and advocated for social-justice causes around the world, died on Tuesday. He was 84.


	Jackson's death was confirmed by his family, who said in a statement that he “died peacefully” while surrounded by family. “Our father was a servant leader — not only to our family, but to the oppressed, the voiceless, and the overlooked around the world,” the family's statement continued. “We shared him with the world, and in return, the world became part of our extended family. His unwavering belief in justice, equality, and love uplifted millions, and we ask you to honor his memory by continuing the fight for the values he lived by.” A cause of death was not immediately available.


	In November 2025, Jackson was hospitalized in Chicago where he was put under observation for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a neurological disorder that can affect body movements and balance. PSP is similar to Parkinson's, which Jackson was originally diagnosed with in 2013. His PSP diagnosis was confirmed in April 2025.

	











	For more than 50 years, Jackson was one of the most prominent activists in the United States. He got his start in the Sixties, working closely with Martin Luther King Jr., before founding two advocacy groups, Operation PUSH (People United to Serve Humanity) and the National Rainbow Coalition. (These two were later consolidated into the Rainbow PUSH Coalition.)

	











	His opposition to Ronald Reagan led him to launch two presidential campaigns, in 1984 and 1988. Though both fell short, Jackson registered millions of new voters and significantly overperformed expectations, finishing third in 1984 (behind Gary Hart and Walter Mondale) and second in 1988 (behind Michael Dukakis). For a brief moment in 1988, he even took the delegate lead over Dukakis after a massive win in the Michigan caucus. 


	As the most prominent and successful Black candidate for president at that time, Jackson helped set the stage for the election of Barack Obama 20 years later. But it was also reforms he advocated for in 1988, which changed how delegates were distributed during the Democratic primary, that made Obama's victory possible, too. And Jackson's campaigns, with their unabashedly progressive platforms, set a mold that future longshot, outsider candidates on the left, like Bernie Sanders, would follow for decades to come.

	“The issues that we raised were resonating,” Jackson recently recalled in Abby Phillip's book A Dream Deferred: Jesse Jackson and the Fight for Black Political Power. “Our issues were on time, issues about economic justice and shared economic security, a connection between family farms and urban workers, how Blacks and whites had to relate together, and browns. So, it was in full gear. We used to call it ‘poor campaign, rich message.' Our message was winning.”


	Born Jesse Burns on Oct. 8, 1941, in Greenville, South Carolina, Jackson was the son of a high school student, Helen Burns, and her 33-year-old neighbor, Noah Robinson. Helen eventually married Charles Henry Jackson, who adopted Jesse and gave his stepson his last name. (Jackson learned the identity of his biological father at a young age and maintained a relationship with him throughout his life.) Of growing up in the Jim Crow South, Jackson told The New York Times in 1987, “I remember being taught my place.”


	He attended segregated schools and sat at the back of the bus until the Montgomery bus boycotts of 1955 (Jackson was 14 at the time). A good student and a standout athlete, Jackson earned a scholarship to play football at the University of Illinois, but left the predominately white school after one year. He transferred to the historically Black North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College, where he continued to play football, but also became involved in the civil rights movement. He then attended the Chicago Theological Seminary, but dropped out before graduating to work for King. (He was ordained at a Chicago church in 1968 and was awarded his Master of Divinity degree in 2000.)

	King appointed Jackson to run Operation Breadbasket under the banner of his Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). As head of the first Chicago chapter, and then the national organization, Jackson focused on encouraging people to patronize Black-owned businesses and organized pickets and boycotts of businesses that refused to hire Black people. 


	Jackson's confident, independent streak eventually generated friction with other top lieutenants in the SCLC, as well as King himself. Jackson was present at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis when King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. He would claim that he was the last person to speak to King before he died and held him in his arms after he was shot. (The next day, he went on TV wearing the same blood-stained turtleneck.) Others in the SCLC disputed Jackson's version of events (he was a floor below King at the motel, for instance), leading to further tensions. 


	In 1971, Jackson left the SCLC to found Operation PUSH (the “S” originally stood for “save” before being changed to “serve”). PUSH continued much of the economic-driven work Jackson was doing for Operation Breadbasket, including boycotts of Anheuser-Busch and Coca-Cola in the 1980s. The group's efforts to bolster education in Black and underprivileged communities earned them federal assistance from the Jimmy Carter administration. But while Jackson's profile grew, PUSH frequently faced criticism for poor management and follow-through. Jackson frequently responded to such criticism with the line “I'm a tree-shaker, not a jam-maker.” 


	When Jackson announced his first campaign for president in November 1983, he was still a polarizing figure and failed to pick up endorsements from prominent Black leaders like Coretta Scott King and Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young. He also faced allegations of anti-Semitism related to his support for a Palestinian state, refusal to disavow Louis Farrakhan, and for referring to Jews as “Hymies” and New York City as “Hymietown” while speaking with a Washington Post reporter. (Jackson denied the allegation.) 


	Jackson's showing in the first two 1984 primary contests, in Iowa and New Hampshire, were poor in these predominately white states. But he did exceptionally well in the next contests in the South, especially among Black voters. Jackson's momentum grew, and he went on to win more than 3 million votes nationally in the 1984 primary. His voter-registration efforts also brought scores of new Black voters to the polls, which proved critical in the Democrats winning the Senate in 1986. 

	











	Speaking at the Democratic National Convention, Jackson spoke about the importance of building a diverse, multiethnic “rainbow coalition” (and even gave his new social-justice and political-empowerment organization the same name, the National Rainbow Coalition). “We are often reminded that we live in a great nation — and we do,” he said during his speech. “But it can be greater still. The Rainbow is mandating a new definition of greatness. We must not measure greatness from the mansion down, but the manger up.”


	Four years later, Jackson significantly expanded his own coalition. He won nearly 30 percent of the popular vote during the primaries while running on a platform that included reversing Reagan-era tax cuts, increasing federal spending for social programs, and implementing single-payer universal healthcare. 


	Despite falling short in 1988, Jackson's second strong showing established him as a prominent figure in Democratic politics. During the Nineties, he was elected to be the shadow senator for Washington, D.C. (a kind of lobbying/advocacy role, focused mainly on D.C. statehood), while President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeline Albright appointed him Secretary of State for the Promotion of Democracy in Africa. Clinton later awarded Jackson with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. 


	Jackson's stature even allowed him to serve as an ad-hoc diplomat. In the Eighties, he helped secure the release of a captured Navy lieutenant in Syria, as well as 48 Cuban and Cuban American prisoners in Cuba. He went on to bring home citizens being held as “human shields” by Saddam Hussein in Kuwait, negotiate the release of U.S. soldiers being held hostage in Kosovo, and the release of British journalists being held in Liberia. 


	While Jackson chose not to run for office again, his son, Jesse Jackson Jr. was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served from 1995 to 2012. The elder Jackson instead focused on his activist work, merging his two groups into the Rainbow PUSH Coalition and advocating on issues both domestic (health care, gun control, the War on Drugs) and international (ending apartheid in South Africa, pushing for democracy in Haiti, negotiating peace between Israel and Palestine, and speaking out against the Iraq War). 


	In 2007, Jackson became one of the earliest backers of Obama's presidential bid, and his son served as a co-chairman on the future president's campaign. But some friction emerged between the rising political star and his predecessor when Jackson was caught on a hot mic criticizing an Obama Father's Day speech. (“I want to cut his nuts out,” Jackson said. “Barack, he is talking down to Black people.”) Jackson did apologize, Obama accepted, and Jackson was famously caught on camera weeping after Obama's victory in November 2008. 

	











	Describing the emotions he felt that night, Jackson told NPR, “Well, on the one hand, I saw President Barack Obama standing there looking so majestic. And I knew that people in the villages of Kenya and Haiti, and mansions and palaces in Europe and China, were all watching this young African American male assume the leadership to take our nation out of a pit to a higher place. And then, I thought of who was not there … the martyrs and murdered whose blood made last night possible. I could not help think that this was their night.”


	Jackson remained a major figurehead in the final decades of his life, while also settling into an elder-statesman role. Though not directly involved with Black Lives Matter — and sometimes seen as out of step by the movement's young leaders — he gave his support to protesters and often stood alongside the families of Black people killed by the police. In 2021, as he was pushing 80 years old, Jackson was arrested twice within a few months during protests related to ending the Senate filibuster and challenges to the Voting Rights Act. 


	In 2023, Jackson announced his plans to step down as head of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition amid his advancing age and growing health concerns. Still, he continued to make public appearances, including the 2024 Democratic National Convention, and speak out on issues that mattered most to him.

	As Paramount continued to lob offers for Warner Bros. Discovery that continued to be rejected, all at $30 a share in cash, the big question from Wall Street to Hollywood has been why not raise the bid.


	It seems that may happen as WBD said Tuesday that it is entering seven days of deal talks with the David Ellison-run company even as it continues to stand by its agreement with Netflix. Warner says that the Ellison camp had verbally agreed to boost its bid to $31 or higher if two the sides engaged, which WBD today has agreed to do.


	“On February 11th, a senior representative of your financial advisor communicated orally to a member of our Board that PSKY would agree to pay $31 per WBD share if we engage with you, and that $31 is not PSKY's best and final proposal,” WBD's board said in a letter to Paramount it released today.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	“We are writing to inform you that Netflix has agreed to provide WBD a waiver of certain terms of the Netflix merger agreement to permit us, through February 23, to engage with PSKY to clarify your proposal, which we understand will include a WBD per share price higher than $31. We seek your best and final proposal.


	“To be clear, our Board has not determined that your proposal is reasonably likely to result in a transaction that is superior to the Netflix merger. We continue to recommend and remain fully committed to our transaction with Netflix and have scheduled a special meeting of our shareholders on March 20, 2026 to vote on the Netflix merger agreement.”

	











	The Netflix deal is for $27.75 a share all in cash, a bid that it sweetened recently from a mix of cash and stock. Its deal is for Warner Bros. Studios and streaming assets, while linear television under Discovery Global is to be spun off into a separate public company.


	Paramount has launched an escalating series of hostile takeover offers for all of WBD. It's latest, on February 10, carried the same $30-a-share base price but also a handful of sweeteners and concessions that put pressure on Warner to take a closer look. A number of WBD shareholders were also pushing the David Zaslav-led company in that direction.


	Netflix has matching rights. 


	The giant streamer said today that, “While we are confident that our transaction provides superior value and certainty, we recognize the ongoing distraction for WBD stockholders and the broader entertainment industry caused by PSKY's antics. Accordingly, we granted WBD a narrow seven-day waiver of certain obligations under our merger agreement to allow them to engage with PSKY to fully and finally resolve this matter.”

Casey and his team has all the power here?

If they leave, there is no HBO.

Imagine if that group of senior development and production execs all left for amazon?

Immediately, they can build the new HBO.

The combined might of billions of dollars of WBD and Paramount debt, paired with piles of linear assets and news divisions no one wants to watch, will make them a true powerhouse of the 20th century.

As long as they turn CNN right wing, this will all be worth it for them.

After what happened yesterday yesterday with Colbert it's imprtant for quality viewing products to stop Paramoun from gaining Warner Bros. Censorship will only increase and the viewing public wiĺl forever suffer from a lack of qua,ity products.

its not censorship, you have to give equal time to political candidates. If he cant be balanced then don't reframe it to be a victim – we are sick of that play

The Equal Time Rule was killed by Reagan in the 80's. Where have you been?

Thats' all this theater is about is getting the stock up and over $30 and trying to do so before the shareholder meeting at the end of this month.  There are incentives for Zazzy and others for doing so and it also sets a new floor that the more mid-tier streamers can reference in their own M&A talks. I'm for WBD and Netflix and a return to physical media.

Steinberg crafted classics for Madonna, the Bangles, Heart, Whitney Houston, JoJo, Cyndi Lauper, Demi Lovato and others.

	“The idea for that song came from personal experience,” Billy Steinberg said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times, as chronicled in Fred Bronson's The Billboard Book of Number One Hits, about Madonna's “Like a Virgin.”


	“I wasn't just trying to somehow get that racy word virgin in a lyric,” mused Steinberg, who co-authored the song with longtime writing partner Tom Kelly. “I was saying that I may not really be a virgin — I've been battered romantically and emotionally like many people — but I'm starting a new relationship and it just feels so good it's healing all the wounds and making me feel like I've never done this before, because it's so much deeper and more profound than anything I've ever felt.”


	The song ruled the Billboard Hot 100 for six weeks in 1984-85 and ranks as Madonna's biggest career hit.


	Steinberg's compositions became mainstays in the Hot 100's top 40 from the 1980s to the 2010s, recorded by acts also including the Bangles, Heart, JoJo, Cyndi Lauper and Demi Lovato, whose “Give Your Heart a Break,” which Steinberg co-wrote with Josh Alexander, also hit No. 1 on Billboard's Pop Airplay chart in 2012.


	In honor of Steinberg, who, as announced Feb. 16, died in Los Angeles at age 75, here is a recap of his 15 biggest Hot 100 hits — including five No. 1s — as a songwriter, all enduring top 40 titles and, notably, all sung by women artists.


	As for “Like a Virgin,” after it was written, Bronson noted that Michael Ostin, then of Warner Brothers Records' A&R department, played it for Madonna, after hearing Kelly and Steinberg's demo, and she “went crazy, and immediately knew it was a song for her and that she could make a great record out of it.”


Songwriter Billy Steinberg's Biggest Billboard Hot 100 hits chart is based on actual performance on the weekly Billboard Hot 100, through the Feb. 14, 2026, ranking. Songs are ranked based on an inverse point system, with weeks at No. 1 earning the greatest value and weeks at No. 100 earning the least. Due to changes in chart methodology over the years, eras are weighted to account for different chart turnover rates over various periods.

Civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson has died at the age of 84, according to a report from BBC News. The outlet included a statement from his family confirming the death and paying tribute to the pivotal figure in U.S. history, revealing Jackson “died peacefully on Tuesday morning.” 

No official cause of death has been revealed as of the time of writing.

Jackson is probably best known for his pioneering work alongside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as a leader within the civil rights movement within the United States. 

In his life, he also ran for president of the United States twice during his life as a candidate for the Democratic Party in 1984 and 1988.

A statement released to BBC News confirms that Jackson “died peacefully on Tuesday morning, surrounded by his family.” 

The statement continues, “His unwavering commitment to justice, equality, and human rights helped shape a global movement for freedom and dignity. A tireless change agent, he elevated the voices of the voiceless from his presidential campaigns in the 1980s to mobilizing millions to register to vote — leaving an indelible mark on history.”

“Reverend Jackson is survived by his wife, Jacqueline; their children – Santita, Jesse Jr., Jonathan, Yusef, Jacqueline; daughter Ashley Jackson, and grandchildren.”

It concluded, “Our father was a servant leader – not only to our family, but to the oppressed, the voiceless, and the overlooked around the world. We shared him with the world, and in return, the world became part of our extended family. His unwavering belief in justice, equality, and love uplifted millions, and we ask you to honour his memory by continuing the fight for the values he lived by.”

Jackson had faced a number of health issues in recent years. In 2017, he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Meanwhile,  was hospitalised for observation in November 2025, with doctors confirming he had been diagnosed with a degenerative condition known as progressive supranuclear palsy.

American-British playwright Bonnie Greer told BBC News that Jackson was a “great” man and acted as a “big brother to my generation.”

She continued, “He was a man who was able to see the big picture, he was able to see the little picture, he was able to put them together to make the idea of America and the world into what he saw – a world where people can not only be equal, they can get better at being equal.”

Deputy Managing Editor


UPDATED: At the top of his monologue tonight, Stephen Colbert introduced the Late Show band, announced guest Jennifer Garner and then asked the audience, “You know who is not one of my guests tonight?”


	The CBS host then answered his own question.


	“That's Texas state representative James Talarico. He was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast. 


	“Then, I was told, in some uncertain terms, that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on. And because my network clearly does not want us to talk about this…Let's talk about this.”

	











	The Late Night host went on to explain FCC Chair Brendan Carr's new guidance on the “equal time” rule, which requires broadcasters who feature qualified political candidates on their airwaves provide time to rivals, if requested.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Deadline has reached out to CBS for comment and this post will be updated when it is received.


	Traditionally, news content has been exempted from the equal time rule and, in recent decades, stations have assumed that it has applied as well as to daytime and late-night talk shows, like The View and Jimmy Kimmel Live, which have featured presidential and other candidates, including figures like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.


	New FCC guidance, though, signaled to those talk shows that they no longer should believe that they would fall under the so-called “bonafide news” exemption. Carr said that a determination on whether a show is exempt would come down to a number of factors, including whether there was a “partisan motivation” in featuring a political candidate as a guest. “If you're fake news, you're not going to qualify for the bona fide news exemption,” said Carr.


	Colbert observed tonight, “It's no surprise that two of the people most affected by this threat are me and my friend Jimmy Kimmel.”

	











	Carr himself mentioned the duo in his recent comments, a clip of which Colbert played.


	“If Kimmel or Colbert want to continue to do their programming,” said Carr, “and they don't want to have to comply with this requirement, then they can go to a cable channel or a podcast or a streaming service and that's fine.” The equal time rule applies only to broadcast and not to other distribution, which are generally outside of the FCC's oversight.


	Colbert then said he was following Carr's advice and posting the entirety of his Talarico interview on YouTube. You can watch it below.


	Per Fox News, the FCC is investigating ABC News' The View for featuring Talarico as a guest earlier this month, after it issued the new guidance. The show did feature Talarico's main rival for the Democratic primary, Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX). Another Democrat, Ahmad Hassan, also is running for the nomination. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-TX) are challenging Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) in the GOP primary, but it is unclear if they would be entitled to equal time as well.


	Talarico posted the YouTube interview on X, writing, “This is the interview Donald Trump didn't want you to see. His FCC refused to air my interview with Stephen Colbert. Trump is worried we're about to flip Texas.” Per Colbert, the CBS lawyers ordered him not to air the interview, apparently out of concern over the FCC restrictions.


	During his Colbert interview, Talarico said, “This is the party that ran against cancel culture, and now they are trying to control what we watch, what we say, what we read. And this is the most dangerous kind of cancel culture, the kind that comes from the top. They went after The View because I went on there. They went after Jimmy Kimmel for telling a joke they didn't like. They went after you for telling the truth about Paramount's bribe to Donald Trump.”


	The sole Democrat on the FCC, Anna Gomez, has blasted Carr for his latest equal time guidance, saying it is an effort to pressure broadcasters and not even a “legitimate investigation.” She said of The View investigation, “The real purpose is to weaponize the FCC's regulatory authority to intimidate perceived critics of this Administration and chill protected speech. That is not how a free society operates.”


	Carr has acknowledged that the equal time rule also applies to radio, meaning that conservative talk shows that dominate many station airwaves also would face restrictions if they feature candidates.


	Broadcast talk shows have operated under the assumption that they are exempt from the rules since at least 2006, when Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R-CA) appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno as he was running for reelection. His Democratic challenger, Phil Angelides, sought equal time, but the FCC ruled that the late night show fell under the exemption.


	While the networks could challenge the FCC's latest guidance, given the agency's past history of not enforcing the equal time rule on talk shows, CBS parent Paramount made concessions to the FCC as part of its merger with Skydance last year. Among other things, it agreed to install an ombudsman “who will receive and evaluate any complaints of bias or other concerns involving CBS.” The person hired, Kenneth Weinstein, has his own ideological point of view, having formerly led the conservative think tank Hudson Institute.


	As they sought to close the Skydance transaction, Paramount's previous owners settled Trump's lawsuit against the CBS for $16 million. Trump sued them over the way that 60 Minutes edited an interview with Kamala Harris, in litigation that CBS attorneys had previously called baseless. 

	











	Paramount currently is seeking to purchase all of Warner Bros. Discovery. Even though that transaction will not come under FCC review, Paramount executive believe they have an easier regulatory review process with the Trump administration Justice Department than Netflix's deal with Warner Bros. for studio and streaming assets. Netflix has a deal in place with Warner Bros., but WBD on Monday announced that it is entering deal talks with Paramount following a sweetened offer.

the last paragraph about the proposed Paramount Warner Discovery purchase is vitally important and should ring alarm bells around the country.

Never bend the knee!!!

Part of Carr's statement is that they are determining what is and isn't “fake news”.

The company's lawyers made a decision based on the best interest of the company, just like hundreds of companies do every day. That's their job.

in response to abuse of power from the President which it sounds like you excuse

Late night comedy shows aren't news broadcasts and have always been free to interview any one they please. This is more control from our government that is becoming more authoritarian by the day.

Her comments came after the L.A. Olympics Committee board publicly backed Wasserman, who announced the sale of his company last week.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


	Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is calling on Casey Wasserman to step down as chairperson of LA28 after some emails of his surfaced in the Department of Justice's Jeffrey Epstein document release.


	During an interview on CNN Monday, the mayor said, “I cannot fire him, but I have an opinion. And my opinion is that he should step down. That's not the opinion of the board.”




	Last week, Wasserman was publicly backed by the Los Angeles Olympics Committee board after they hired an outside law firm to review his interactions with Ghislaine Maxwell, the convicted sex trafficker connected to Epstein. Their flirtatious correspondence took place in 2003, years before Epstein's arrest in Palm Beach. “LA28 takes allegations of misconduct seriously, and our Board is committed to thoroughly reviewing any concerns related to the organization's leadership,” the executive committee wrote. “Mr. Wasserman fully cooperated with the review. We found Mr. Wasserman's relationship with Epstein and Maxwell did not go beyond what has already been publicly documented.”

	Bass made it clear in today's interview that she disagreed with the board's decision. “Here, LA28, which is the committee that is involved with the Olympics, has the discretion,” she told CNN. “The board made a decision. I think that decision was unfortunate. I don't support the decision. I do think that we need to look at the leadership.”


	The mayor also called Maxwell's behavior “abhorrent.”


	Bass's new comments come after she previously avoided commenting on the Wasserman controversy, saying last week that “any decision on the LA28 leadership must be made by the LA28 Board.” It's unclear what prompted her about-face on Wasserman, who has raised millions of dollars during his decade-long bid to bring the games to the city.

	











	But the mogul has faced a mountain of public backlash, and a spate of client defections, since the massive trove of additional  DoJ documents on Epstein were released on Jan. 30. A number of artists, including Chappell Roan and John Summit, have either left his agency already or threatened to leave if he didn't resign.


	After previously saying he “deeply regrets” his past communication with Maxwell, he decided to put his agency up for sale last week amid the controversy, saying that he had “become a distraction” from his company's operations. (Privately, sources say, he has blamed rival agents like Ari Emanuel for helping to fan the controversy that led to his departure from the company.)


	“I'm deeply sorry that my past personal mistakes have caused you so much discomfort,” he wrote in a statement to his 4,000-member staff. “It's not fair to you, and it's not fair to the clients and partners we represent so vigorously and care so deeply about.”


	Elsewhere in the memo, Wasserman said he'll now be devoting his “full attention to delivering Los Angeles an Olympic Games in 2028 that is worthy of this outstanding city.”


	Aside from his decades-old ties to Maxwell, including emails dating back to 2003, Wasserman has maintained that he “never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” aside from a 2002 philanthropic flight to Africa on Epstein's plane with Bill Clinton and others.

Taylor Swift introduces "Amber, Alysa and Isabeau, three American showgirls on ice" in an NBC clip soundtracked by "Opalite."


													By
												

	Ashley Iasimone



Taylor Swift‘s “Opalite” is the soundtrack in a new NBC Olympics preview that has the pop star introducing Team USA figure skaters Alysa Liu, Amber Glenn and Isabeau Levito — a trio of athletes also known as “The Blade Angels.”


	“Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce you to Amber, Alysa and Isabeau, three American showgirls on ice who will capture your heart with their stories,” Swift says in a voiceover for the clip, which was released on Monday (Feb. 16) and which goes on to give a brief backstory for three figure skaters competing on the U.S. team. (See NBC's broadcast schedule for figure skating coverage here.)

	











	“Amber will be the first to tell you about how many battles she's fought, and about how the ones she's lost have meant as much as the wins. Her superpower now is embracing the fight and daring the world to test her self-belief,” Swift says of Amber Glenn.




	“As for Alyssa, she walked away from skating when she was 16, but then came back on her own terms. Joy fuels her now. Every jump, a celebration. Every performance, a testament to the beauty of knowing yourself,” adds Swift.


	“And then, Isabeau,” says Swift. “I mean, she's destiny personified. Her mom grew up in Milan, and her nona, her grandma, lived exactly 13 minutes from the Olympic rink. When you skate like you're meant to be out there, history has a funny way of showing up.”


	Swift's — who just released a music video (and a couple extended versions, with behind-the-scenes footage) for her latest The Life of a Showgirl single, “Opalite,” — has been showing her support for the Team USA in the 2026 Winter Games. Earlier in February, a video she filmed of herself wishing the Olympic athletes luck aired during NBC's opening ceremony.

Apple Martin denied rampant social media rumors she was expelled from a school for bullying. 

“Hi! I didn't wanna respond but this narrative is completely false and has gotten so out of hand,” she wrote in a comment she then re-shared to Instagram Stories on Monday.

She went on to clarify that she's never been expelled from any school, especially for “bullying.”

“I completely understand ppl not liking me and that is okay! The internet is a place where ppl can share their opinions. But this rumor is completely untrue, I am not that type of person and anyone who is close to me knows that ❤️.”

The Vanderbilt University student, 21, wrote atop the screengrab, “just a quick little message from myself.” It's unclear where she originally shared the comment.  

The daughter of Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, 48, and Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow, 53, previously faced bullying rumors after video footage emerged of her seemingly attempting to crash a fellow debutant's impromptu photo shoot during Le Bal des Debutantes in Paris in December 2024.

She was also filmed seemingly rolling her eyes while entering the invite-only gala arm-in-arm with Count Leo Henckel von Donnersmarck.

But  Aliénor Loppin de Montmort — the young woman from the video — subsequently defended Apple. 

 “[Apple's] genuinely the nicest girl ever! She really doesn't deserve an ounce of what she's getting,” she told People in 2024. “She was the nicest girl ever towards not only me but all the debs!”

A source close to Paltrow told the Daily Mail at the time that, “Apple's more playful and fun and she's really a total girls' girl.”

They added that Apple “would never mean to take the spotlight from anyone, that was not her intention and insisted that to “characterize her as a mean girl is very untrue.” 

“She really had such a wonderful evening and I feel bad that this is even taking away from that because it was such an uplifting evening for her and the other girls,” they explained. 

Apple playfully addressed the accusations in a TikTok video with pals at the time.

“I don't know how anyone has a problem with us. We are such a delight,” the trio of friends acted out a pre-recorded voiceover. 

“We are two of the funniest girls and I know us, like offline,” one pal mouthed as the camera cut to an image of Ava Crox — who initially shared the video of Apple at her high society debut. 

“When I tell you, there aren't two more caring, charitable, generous, kind…” the video continued.

Frederick Wiseman has died. The documentary filmmaker best known for capturing people trapped in the grinding gears of corrupt institutions for more than half a century passed peacefully, his family announced today. He was 96. 

“For nearly six decades, Frederick Wiseman created an unparalleled body of work, a sweeping cinematic record of contemporary social institutions and ordinary human experience primarily in the United States and France,” Wiseman's production company, Zipporah Films, announced in a statement. “His films—from Titicut Follies (1967) to his most recent work, Menus-Plaisirs – Les Troisgros (2023)—are celebrated for their complexity, narrative power, and humanist gaze. He produced and directed all of his 45 films under the banner of Zipporah Films, Inc.”

Born in Boston, Massachusetts, on New Year's Day in 1930, Wiseman was the son of a lawyer, Jacob, who helped Jews escape from European nations engulfed by Nazism, and an aspiring actress named Gertude. Initially following in his father's footsteps, Wiseman attended Williams College and Yale Law School, graduating in 1954 before being drafted into the army. Upon returning to the United States, he took a job teaching law at Boston University's Institute of Law and Medicine. That's when he began to show his mother's influence as Wiseman made his first steps outside the court and classroom to produce Shirley Clarke's The Cool World, a fictional narrative drama that cast real Harlem kids and gang members. He followed it with his first documentary, Titicut Follies, in 1967. Shot over 29 days in Massachusetts's Bridgewater State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, Wiseman's camera observed staff abusing and degrading patients forced into inhumane living conditions. The film shocked the Massachusetts government, which accused Wiseman of breaking an “oral contract” that gave the state final cut and violating the patients' privacy and dignity. As a result, the film remained banned from public screenings until 1991. 



Titicut Follies set the standard for how Wiseman would make his “reality fictions,” as he called them, over the next 60 years. Unlike his contemporaries, Wiseman's films were free of narration, diegetic music, on-screen text, or talking-head interviews. In 1968's High School, Wiseman again spent approximately a month as a fly-on-the-wall, observing but never commenting directly on how those within the institution interacted. The action caught on film would be the story, but Wiseman quickly realized the key to his style was in the edit, where he could juxtapose moments for dramatic and comedic effect. He's never in the movie, but, as he told The A.V. Club in 2015, “I'm all over the movie, because I'm making all the choices that go into it.”

“It's a combination of luck and good judgment in different proportions in different times. And then knowing how to use it, and that's a function of your general experience. So much of these movies, particularly in the timing, have nothing to do with film,” Wiseman continued. “It has to do with deluding yourself into believing that you're understanding what you're seeing and hearing in the rushes[…]So I have to convince myself, whether correctly or not, that I understand not only a sequence, but all the sequences in order to make the judgment whether it's useful to me and how I want to edit it and what its relationship is to other sequences I've selected.”



With the backing of PBS and various grants, including a Guggenheim and a MacArthur Fellowship, Wiseman continued making films about the shortcomings of bureaucracies and institutions that, ostensibly, are designed to help people. Welfare, his 1975 documentary, showed the realities of the welfare system that traps people in the Sisyphean struggle of attempting to receive the bare minimum of government aid. But his boundless curiosity wasn't confined to governmental failures. His 1981 film, Model, shows the inner workings of a New York modeling agency, Zoli; in 1995, he directed Ballet about the American Ballet Theatre. He also directed several short films, including 2022's A Couple, which he made shortly after the death of Zipporah, his wife of 65 years. He continued making movies well into the 21st century, producing well-regarded documentaries, including In Jackson Heights and City Hall, before officially retiring after 2025. 

He is survived by his two sons with Zipporah, David and Eric, and three grandchildren.

Oops, he did it again. Hallmark hunk Tyler Hynes was accused of “breaking the internet” yet again by fans who couldn't help but swoon over the vacation pics he posted on February 16, 2026. 

Likely instigating gasps heard 'round the world, from office cubicles to carpool lines, the “Three Wisest Men” star gifted his fandom — affectionately known as the Hynies — with a collection of tropical snapshots that started with him shirtless, walking along the beach as the sun set on the horizon. 

Hynes certainly deserved to start 2026 with a little R&R after a jam-packed fourth quarter that included two highly anticipated Hallmark movie premieres (“Three Wisest Men” and “Christmas Above the Clouds”), fan events across the U.S., and filming a special new movie expected to premiere this year (more on that later!). 

Based on the photos and videos Hynes shared, he returned to a tropical spot he'd been before, with the same location featured in a post from Earth Day 2025. One fan even noted, “Beautiful place😍. I can see why you make it your January home. Pura Vida🤙🤍😌”

Hynes' latest post showcased a relaxing time away where he was able to skateboard and surf in the sunshine, relax with a beer by the ocean, and take in the local culture. He even shared a video from a tiny Pura Vida plane, often used by tourists in Costa Rica, and monkeys playing in the trees. 

Fans flooded Hynes' vacation post with cute comments as they swooned, including one who quipped, “Ty breaking the internet on this Monday! 😍😂”

Someone else gushed, “Oh my the scenery is so Beautiful ❤️ but Tyler all I can say is your so 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️” and another wrote, “Stunning view of ocean and you!” 

The Tyler Hynes Shirtless Instagram account (yes, really!) commented, “Always appreciate the January content. ❤️🙌🔥”

Many also shared their gratitude with Hynes, noting that it was generous and kind of Hynes to share scenes from his vacation. One wrote, “Thank you for sharing and enjoy your time on the beach well deserved 🌊❤️❤️❤️”

Another chimed in, “You certainly know how to make the most out of your time spent off the grid. It is incredibly important to pause & take time for yourself, but I'm so glad you choose to share glimpses of your adventures with us. 🤍”

Some of Hynes' Hallmark pals weighed in, too. Kimberley Sustad declared that she's “coming next year” and Taylor Cole added, “😍 yes please 🙌”

Gay????

Maybe Gay????

No he is not gay.  He is straight and completely delicious. And he loves it when his fans swoon.   The energy fuels his self deprecating ego.

Tyler hynes is the most beautiful and wonderful and amazing man ever !!!

Gay, straight, whatever! He's not only handsome but a nice guy. Very personable at the Edison NJ Christmas Con. I told him he was taller than I thought. He was happy to hear that! LOL!

The Grammy winner also penned hits for Whitney Houston and Demi Lovato, among others.

Billy Steinberg, the Grammy-winning songwriter who co-wrote such pop classics as Madonna's “Like A Virgin,” Cyndi Lauper's “True Colors” and the Bangles' “Eternal Flame” that were some of the biggest, most indelible hits of the 1980s and beyond, has died, his attorney confirmed to Billboard. Steinberg, who was 10 days away from his 76th birthday, died of cancer in Los Angeles.


	In addition to those three songs, Steinberg — who specialized in big, emotional power ballads with impactful, vulnerable lyrics — had two other songs reach No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100: Whitney Houston's “So Emotional” and Heart's Alone,” all co-written with his longtime writing partner, Tom Kelly.  


	The lyricist, who landed chart hits for more than 30 years, also penned such tunes as the Pretenders' “I'll Stand by You,” the Bangles' “In Your Room” and the Divinyls' “I Touch Myself.” Taylor Dayne, Tina Turner, Pat Benatar, Bette Midler, Cheap Trick, Belinda Carlisle and many other artists also recorded his songs.


	In a statement to Billboard, Lauper called Steinberg “great lyricist and a wonderful collaborator. He and Tom had such a way of capturing the range within an emotion, from the subtlety to urgency…For ‘True Colors,' there was a lot of back and forth which I know was hard for him. In the end, he said that I had really invented my own ‘very exquisitely beautiful version' of the song. That really meant a lot to me. It is a special song.”


	“I remember my mom picking me up from elementary school and there was this urgency and magic in the air,” recalls Steinberg's son, Ezra, who is a songwriter signed to Sony Music Publishing. “I asked what was going on, and she said, ‘Dad has a hit.' It was [JoJo‘s 2006 song] ‘Too Little Too Late.' It was the first time I was old enough to really experience one of his hits, and to see the whole process — loving the demo for months, asking him every day when it was coming out, and then finally hearing it on KIIS-FM on the way to and from school. I felt this deep sense of pride and elation. That was magical.”


	A 2011 inductee into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Fresno, California, native grew up in Palm Springs, California. After attending Bard College in New York's Hudson Valley, he pursued a career as an artist with his band Billy Thermal. While they may not have flourished, Steinberg's career took off after the group's guitarist played “How Do I Make You,” penned solely by Steinberg, for Linda Rondstadt, who recorded it for her Mad Love album in 1980. The song reached No. 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.


	Steinberg and Kelly, in addition to recording as the duo I-10 for Epic Records, were one of the top songwriting teams of the ‘80s and ‘90s, often writing signature songs for artists, including “Like A Virgin,” which remained at No. 1 for six weeks, the most of any of Madonna's hits. Billboard ranked the song as Madonna's biggest hit of her career in 2024.


	After Kelly retired as a songwriter, Steinberg continued to write, often with Rick Nowels, including penning Dion's “Falling Into You,” the title track for Dion's 1996 album, which won album of the year for the 39th Grammy Awards and for which both Steinberg and Nowels took home a Grammy.


	The two originally wrote “Falling Into You” with Marie-Claire D'Ubaldo for the Argentine singer's album, but  that album failed to take off. The songwriters bought back the track, complete with Paul Buckmaster string arrangements, for $15,000 so Dion could record it and added her vocals. The song went to No. 1 in a number of countries including Spain and Greece. 


	“Billy began as a poet and he developed a sense for that, an esthetic, where in one sentence or two sentences you can create a whole story. He was a one off. They won't make another one. He had an encyclopedic knowledge, of popular songs and that's where he and I connected,” Nowels says of Steinberg, whom he met in the early '80s through Nowels' wife as the two men were both experiencing their first flushes of success. “We just enjoyed each other's brains. We enjoyed each other's minds. We were friends to the very end.”


	More recently, in the 2010s, Steinberg's songs were cut by Nicole Scherzinger, Miranda Cosgrove and Demi Lovato, who took “Give Your Heart A Break” (co-written with Josh Alexander) to No. 16 on the Hot 100 in 2012.


	At the Grammy Museum's 2023 “The Power of Song: A Songwriters Hall of Fame Exhibit,” Steinberg was represented by a demo for “True Colors” recorded on a TDK SA 60 cassette and a note from Lauper that read, “Billy — Thanks for sending me and writing such a beautiful song. (heart) Cyndi.”


	He is survived by his beloved wife, Trina; his sons, Ezra and Max; his sisters, Barbara and Mary; and his stepchildren, Raul and Carolina.

Rest in Peace, Billy Steinberg! Thank you for leaving us some of the world's best soundtracks!

I got to hang out with Billy & Tom in the 80s. I met them through my brother in law GaryUsher. It was super fun and exciting. They wrote the song True Colors in 15 minutes. So creative. So sad for the music world.

The 41st Independent Spirit Awards were all about “Train Dreams.” Clint Bentley‘s sophomore directorial outing took home the Spirit Awards for Best Feature, Best Director, and Best Cinematography for Adolpho Veloso. It was a triumphant day for the independent film, which is heading into the Oscars with momentum a year after its Sundance debut. 

Before all the excitement began, Bentley took a Coffee Break with Lavazza. Prior to the ceremony, IndieWire and the beloved Italian coffee brand partnered to host intimate conversations with the filmmakers and performers behind some of our favorite films and shows.

 










Given the choice of Light Roast or Dark Roast questions, Bentley opted for a heftier Dark Roast and opened up about the challenges of shooting the film in the Washington wilderness.

“It was an independent film so we can go down the list,” Bentley said with a laugh when asked about the problems he encountered. “We were shooting on location in the US, in Washington state. You never have enough money, you never have enough time. But the whole crew believed in this so much and put their whole heart behind it.”

The incredible finished film isn't the only reason that the challenges were worth it. Bentley explained that the encouragement he received from his collaborators taught him to stop giving up on ideas before he had a chance to try them. It's a lesson that helped him fulfill his vision for “Train Dreams,” and one that he'll carry with him on future creative endeavors. 

 










“I learned to believe in myself. And I learned that through the people around me believing in me. To make this film was a jump from ‘Jockey,' and my producers, Joel [Edgerton], Adolpho, my production designer Alex Schaller, told me ‘Don't limit yourself. Let reality limit you, but don't start by limiting yourself.' That's a lesson I learned in this process, and I'd tell any filmmaker to learn it early rather than waiting like me.”

Robert Duvall, whose career spanned more than 70 years, died at 95. The Academy Award winner for 1983's “Tender Mercies” shaped American cinema with powerful performances in “The Godfather,” “Apocalypse Now,” “To Kill a Mockingbird,” and other landmark films widely regarded as classics of American cinema.

After news of his death broke, his “Godfather” co-stars began speaking out. They honored the actor whose presence helped anchor one of Hollywood's most iconic sagas.

Al Pacino remembered Duvall as a gifted performer and longtime colleague.

“It was an honor to have worked with Robert Duvall,” Pacino said, as reported by Variety. “He was a born actor, as they say, his connection with it, his understanding, and his phenomenal gift will always be remembered. I will miss him.”

Pacino starred alongside Duvall in “The Godfather” and “The Godfather: Part II.” Pacino played Michael Corleone, while Duvall portrayed Tom Hagen, the family's loyal attorney. Their performances helped define one of film's most celebrated sagas.

Robert De Niro also responded to the news with a short but heartfelt message in a statement to Variety. “God bless Bobby,” De Niro wrote. “I hope I can live till I'm 95. May he rest in peace.”

De Niro portrayed a young Vito Corleone in “The Godfather: Part II.” 

While he and Duvall did not appear together in scenes, both actors became essential to the film's lasting impact and its place in cinema history.

His wife, Luciana, confirmed his death on Monday, February 16, in a message shared on Facebook. 

“Yesterday, we said goodbye to my beloved husband, cherished friend, and one of the greatest actors of our time. Bob passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by love and comfort.”

She added, “To the world, he was an Academy Award-winning actor, a director, a storyteller. To me, he was simply everything. His passion for his craft was matched only by his deep love for characters, a great meal, and holding court. For each of his many roles, Bob gave everything to his characters and to the truth of the human spirit they represented. In doing so, he leaves something lasting and unforgettable to us all. Thank you for the years of support you showed Bob and for giving us this time and privacy to celebrate the memories he leaves behind.” Duvall is survived by his wife.

Nancy Guthrie's $1 million and 3,776-square-foot home in Tucson, Arizona, has been owned by the beloved Guthrie matriarch since 1975, HELLO! reported. There, she raised her three kids, Camron, Annie and Savannah; watched them learn how to ride a bike; sent them off to their first days of school; and sat together for dinner as a family.

Although she has been missing for over two weeks, having been abducted from her Catalina Foothills residence in the early morning hours of Feb. 1, Nancy's family remains hopeful for her safe return, as they continue to keep her property maintained.

In a report from TMZ, the outlet shared that on Monday, Feb. 16, the Guthrie family hired a landscaper to upkeep Nancy's property, which sits on an acre of land located in a deserted terrain surrounded by cacti.

In video footage from a KNXV-TV journalist, a groundskeeper is seen walking her property after grabbing tools from an unmarked red truck. 

The landscaper brisked past a parked sheriff's car to get into Nancy's backyard as a reporter attempted to get a statement from him. 

Several days before this, the Guthrie family hired a pool service to maintain Nancy's pool on Feb. 13. According to TMZ, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told them that Ambiance Pool Service & Supplies was hired at the request of Nancy's loved ones.

Sheriff Nanos also reiterated that fact in a statement to media partners. “At the request of the Guthrie family, routine pool maintenance was conducted at the residence today,” the statement said, CNN reported.

In a “TODAY” show segment from November 2025, Nancy joined daughter Savannah, where they discussed the sacredness of the matriarch's Tucson home. 

“It's so wonderful. Just the air — the quality of life is laid back and gentle,” Nancy shared with Savannah after she was asked what made her want to stay in Tucson for the majority of her life.

During the search for the beloved 84-year-old, Savannah shared an emotional tribute to her mom on her Instagram. In the video, the NBC broadcaster stitched together several home videos from her childhood.

Savannah captioned the poignant video, expressing the hope she has for her mom's return home. “our lovely mom. 💛 we will never give up on her,” she wrote. “thank you for your prayers and hope ❤️.”

Washington: An American filmmaker and conservative activist who claims Barack Obama's real father was a communist poet and that Michelle Obama “is not who she pretends to be” will address a conference in Australia hosted by rising right-wing lobby group Advance.

Joel Gilbert is a regular contributor to far-right conspiracy theory media outlets such as Alex Jones' Infowars and fake news website The Gateway Pundit, where he is currently pushing the claim that a candidate for governor of California is ineligible for that office.

One of Gilbert's films explores the urban legend that the Beatles' Paul McCartney died in 1966 and was replaced by a lookalike, though he now calls it a “mockumentary”. He has also made a conspiratorial film about the killing of African-American teenager Trayvon Martin.

Gilbert is being flown into Australia by Advance to be a key speaker at a conference in Sydney, alongside former prime minister Tony Abbott and Liberal MP Moira Deeming. He is billed to make a half-hour speech on Saturday morning titled: “The quiet coup: how judicial politicisation threatens democratic society.”

Gilbert told this masthead he will discuss a trend by Democrats since Obama to appoint “radical judges” in the judicial system, and a parallel “drift” in Australia, whereby courts were increasingly “asked to adjudicate issues about immigration and health mandates and environmental regulations, and use executive discretion”.

He confirmed Advance was paying for his travel to Australia. The conference is called “Evolve: Because being right isn't enough”, and is described in an email to subscribers as “the political event of the year”.

Questioned on his claims that Obama's real father was Frank Marshall Davis, a communist poet and friend of Obama's grandfather, Gilbert said: “I don't have the DNA, but certainly the photos bear it out.”

The film was “more about Davis's ideological influence on Obama”, he said, repeating an unproven claim that Obama was raised by Davis. Gilbert rejected the label of “conspiracy theorist”, saying the term was used to dismiss people's research rather than engage in the facts.

Advance did not respond to inquiries about how much it was paying Gilbert to appear, and whether that was the best use of donors' money.

Disclosure records show Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting was the lobby group's largest donor in 2024-25, making two payments totalling $895,000. Rinehart was contacted for comment.

While in Australia, Gilbert will also appear at NSW Parliament for a screening of his 2018 film Trump: The Art of the Insult – an event being sponsored by Libertarian Party MP John Ruddick.

Gilbert has an ongoing association with Australia. His film about Al Gore – in which he interviews an AI version of the former Democratic vice president – made its “world premiere” at the 2024 Conservative Political Action Conference in Brisbane. Gilbert says Ruddick gave him the idea for the film.

In January, while appearing on far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones's program Infowars, Gilbert called the Albanese government “radical far-left” and spoke disparagingly about Muslim immigration.

“Australia has a radical far-left Labor government. They have the same in the UK … It's hard to get a united western front when half of your best allies are far-left and believe in this idea of DEI and inclusivity,” he said.

“They don't really understand the big picture of what it means to bring large populations of Muslims into your country, and not understanding that they have a different way of life, a different political goal and a different value system than your society does.”

The Jersey Shore's Hit Music Channel

UFOs are back in the headlines following a recent interview with Barack Obama. It's time to ask again how many New Jersey residents believe in them.

We conducted an informal survey over the past few days to see how many people believe in unidentified flying objects, aliens, and abductions, and you might be surprised by the results.

It is a far cry from believing there are unidentified craft in our skies as compared to little grey or green beings walking around our planet.

We considered that when we broke the answers down into categories. We asked New Jersey residents inan informal survey their thoughts on UFOs, and here is what we learned.

Here are the results from our unscientific survey. We asked random state residents and listeners to my radio show if they believed in the following three things, and here are the percentages of people who said they do.

Believe in UFOs - 78%

Believe Aliens Are On The Earth - 43%

Believe Alien Abductions Are Real - 19%

The statistic that surprises me the most is the "aliens on Earth" number. Nearly half of New Jersey residents think they are among us.

According to the National UFO Reporting Center, there have been three UFO sightings in New Jersey in 2026. They were reported in Chatham, Atlantic City, and Bridgewater.

The former president was forced to clarify his comments after an interview with Brian Tyler Cohen

Former President Barack Obama sat down with influencer Brian Tyler Cohen for a friendly conversation that centered on the political divisions roiling the country, but there was one exchange that seemed to unite disparate factions, at least temporarily, in a shared excitement: the moment Obama seemed to confirm the existence of aliens. 

“Are aliens real?” Cohen asked the former president point-blank.

“They're real,” Obama replied, before adding, “But I haven't seen them and they're not being kept in Area 51. There is no underground facility. Unless there is this enormous conspiracy, and they hid it from the president of the United States.” 

The former president went on to joke that the first question he wanted answered when he became president was “Where are the aliens?”

The YouTube video of the one-on-one conversation has attracted more than 4 million views since it was posted on Saturday. 

Obama posted the alien clip to his own Instagram account on Sunday evening, but tamped down enthusiasm for his comments in the caption.

“I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it's gotten attention let me clarify. Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there,” the former president wrote. “But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we've been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”

Obama's view on the possibility of extraterrestrial existence has, with developments in astronomy, become the scientific consensus.

As the journalist Garret M. Graff, author of UFO: The Inside Story of the US Government's Search for Alien Life Here—and Out There, reported for Rolling Stone, advances in technology have helped scientists put a figure to the number of habitable planets — planets with the conditions to support life as we recognize it — in the universe. Current estimates hover around one sextillion such planets or one billion trillions. 

With those numbers, the odds are heavily in favor of the possibility that life is out there — just very far away. The absolute closest galaxy to ours, the Andromeda Galaxy, is roughly 2.5 million lightyears away; the 100,000 galaxies that make up our next closest neighbors exist in a “cosmic suburb” that spans roughly 520 million lightyears of outer space. As Graff wrote, “The math may very well be on the side of the aliens existing, but that's largely because the math of the universe itself turns out to be astounding.”

Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri arrives at the Los Angeles Superior Court before testifying on Feb. 11, 2026.

Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, appeared in a Los Angeles courtroom Wednesday as an “adverse witness” in a landmark trial over claims that Meta's Instagram and Google's YouTube functioned as “digital casinos,” dispensing dopamine-driven rewards to keep children scrolling despite known risks.

Minutes after taking the stand, he was confronted with remarks from a podcast interview he gave in March 2020 where he said, “There's such a thing as being addicted to a social media platform.” Mosseri told jurors he had misspoken. “Clearly, I wasn't careful with my words during that podcast,” he testified in the packed courtroom in downtown Los Angeles. “Sometimes I make mistakes.”





































When Lori Harito started noticing the slow death of traditional media, she just knew she couldn't stay where she was. In the volatile world of Canadian content, where the ground shifts daily beneath the feet of creators, Harito's transition from the newsroom to the boardroom of her own boutique PR agency, Boulevard of Dreams, feels less like a career pivot and more like a necessary evolution.

“Journalism is an unstable, unsteady career path, but it was something I truly, truly loved,” Harito reflects. That foundation, a deep-rooted respect for the trenches of storytelling, is exactly what is currently disrupting the often-sterile and overly corporate world of public relations. Along with her partner-in-strategy, Kelly McCabe, Harito is proving that in 2026, the most valuable currency isn't just reach, it's keeping a finger on the pulse.

As lawyer Mark Lanier flashed a cartoon road sign reading “Science of Addiction” on a large screen inside a Los Angeles courtroom Tuesday, Dr. Anna Lembke walked jurors through what she described as the four “C's” of addiction: loss of control, cravings, compulsions, and consequences.

Called as the first witness in a closely watched trial over claims Meta and YouTube negligently designed platforms that were addictive to children, Lembke, the medical director of Stanford University's addiction medicine program and the author of the best-selling book Dopamine Nation, said young users' brains are “especially vulnerable” to problems associated with those four traits. The reason, she told jurors, is that adolescents' prefrontal cortices are not yet fully integrated with deeper midbrain systems that regulate behavior.

































Seattle Seahawks' quarterback #14 Sam Darnold and Seattle Seahawks' head coach Mike Macdonald celebrate with the Vince Lombardi Trophy after the Seattle Seahawks defeated the New England Patriots during Super Bowl LX at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California on February 8, 2026.

The Seattle Seahawks have won Super Bowl LX, defeating the New England Patriots 29-13 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, on Sunday.

Kenneth Walker III was named the game's Most Valuable Player, for good reason — the running back managed to get 135 rushing yards and 27 attempts, racking up significant yardage for the Seahawks.







Bad Bunny is on a roll. The Latin superstar just made history with his Grammy win for Album of the Year and will keep his historic streak going when he delivers the first Super Bowl halftime headlining show in Spanish on Sunday. Bad Bunny has already promised “the world will dance” in a preview trailer, so it's bound to be one hell of a blowout bash as the star celebrates his beloved Puerto Rico on the national stage.

But what's a party without a killer guest list? During his “No Me Quiero Ir De Aqui” residency in P.R. last year, the star invited a star-studded Rolodex of past collaborators and famous friends each night. It only makes sense he would bring some of those same folks, and even bigger stars, out for his big moment at the Super Bowl. We're not sure what he's going to do yet: Given his ICE speeches at the Grammys, it's likely he could get political. He could also dedicate the entire performance to Puerto Rico. But while we're guessing, here's a list of potential performers we think Bad Bunny may bring out on Sunday.

Hoping that these aliens are more Grogu from The Mandalorian and less the Xenomoprh from Alien.

Last week, former US President Barack Obama jumped onto a podcast with Brian Tyler Cohen in which they discussed a wide array of topics. One clip in particular from the podcast went “out of this world” viral after host Brian Tyler Cohen asked former president Obama “are aliens real?”. You can catch the clip below.

A post shared by Barack Obama (@barackobama)

The answer made headlines with many commenters astounded by the former presidents honesty. With many interpreting his answer that he had seen legitimate proof of alien life off earth. Which, understandably had many people losing their minds and freaking out. The clip has gone so viral that the former president has even had to release a clarifying comment to calm people down.

“I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it's gotten attention let me clarify. Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we've been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!” – Barack Obama

Well there we have it. Obama believes has not seen any solid evidence of aliens or little green men in Area 51, but confidently feels that the universe is so grand that it is all but a certainty life off earth exists.

What do you think? Do you think the aliens made him say these comments after they got mad at him for exposing them. We'll never know.
