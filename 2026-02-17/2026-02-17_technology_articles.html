                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CBS forced The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to cancel an appearance by a Democrat up for election later this year, according to the host. The decision stems from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's repeated threats to punish network television stations that he believes are airing unbalanced political content. “Texas State Rep. James Talarico, he was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,” host Stephen Colbert said on air on Monday night. The reason stems from a long-time Federal Communications Commission rule called the “Equal Time Rule,” which states that all candidates in an election should be offered equal airtime for their messaging on radio and broadcast channels. The “Equal Time Rule” does not apply to streaming, nor does it apply to news interviews or talk show interviews with politicians. Last month, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr signaled his intention to drop the exception for daytime and late-night TV talk shows, claiming that the programs are “motivated by partisan purposes.” In response to the news, Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez told Politico that “the FCC is now a political arm of this administration.” Colbert said that Carr's letter was announcing the intention to drop the exception, but it wasn't a real policy change yet. “He hasn't done away with it yet, but my network is unilaterally enforcing it as if he had,” Colbert said. “But I want to assure you, ladies and gentlemen, please, I want to assure you, this decision is for purely financial reasons.” As a result of the network's pressure, Colbert has instead posted his interview with Tallarico on the Late Show's YouTube channel, though CBS even barred him from giving out a URL or a QR code for it on air. Colbert also pointed out that this isn't the FCC's first attack on talk shows or Rep. Tallarico. Earlier this month, the FCC reportedly opened an investigation into ABC's “The View” talk show, promptly following an interview with Rep. Tallarico. “I think that Donald Trump is worried that we're about to flip Texas,” Tallarico said in the Colbert interview posted on YouTube. After an investigation found some customers were charged nearly 25% more for identical items, Instacart says it's ending its controversial price-testing program.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Temporal has raised $300 million in a Series D funding round at a $5 billion valuation, positioning the company as a key infrastructure provider for the emerging wave of AI agents moving into real-world production. Temporal builds open-source software and a cloud service that helps companies run long-running, complex workflows reliably — what it calls “durable execution.” The Bellevue, Wash.-based company says that as AI systems become more autonomous and take actions across multiple services, reliability has become a challenge. “Agentic AI doesn't fail because the models aren't good enough,” Samar Abbas, CEO and co-founder of Temporal, said in a press release. “It fails because the systems around them can't handle real-world execution.” Temporal says revenue grew more than 380% year-over-year, weekly active usage increased 350%, and installations rose 500%. OpenAI uses Temporal to help power certain production workflows. Andreessen Horowitz described Temporal as becoming a foundational execution layer for the AI era. “For long-running agents operating over extended horizons, the durability that Temporal provides is the difference between a compelling demo and a production system,” the Silicon Valley firm wrote in a blog post. Temporal originally focused on helping developers manage complex, distributed workflows. But the rise of AI agents has amplified the need for infrastructure that can safely execute long-running, stateful systems over extended periods. Temporal's platform preserves application state, automatically retries failed steps, and allows workflows to resume exactly where they left off instead of starting over. Temporal co-founders Samar Abbas and Maxim Fateev previously worked together at Uber and helped build an internal open-source orchestration engine called Cadence. The experience helped inspire them to launch Temporal in 2019. Temporal also announced Tuesday that Raghu Raghuram, former VMware CEO and general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, is joining the company as a board observer. Other backers in the latest round include Lightspeed Venture Partners and Sapphire Ventures, along with existing investors including Sequoia Capital, Index, Tiger, GIC, Madrona, and Amplify.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. With memory costs still sky-high, finding deals is key to maximizing bang for your buck. Newegg is leading the charge with multiple bundles that offer some combination of RAM, CPU, and motherboard, often throwing in some freebies on top of it (think games, or AIOs, or even an air duster). We're spotlighting a deal on a capable budget-class motherboard in the Gigabyte B850 Aorus Elite Wifi 7, along with 32GB of Corsair Vengeance RGB DDR5-6400 RAM for just under $505 (20%/$133.00 off), which makes the overall price more palatable. We reviewed the B850 Aorus Elite Wifi 7 motherboard a while ago, and even at $230 (when it was released), it was a good overall value, showing solid all-around performance in our testing, a wide range of DIY-friendly features, three M.2 sockets, ample USB ports, and a budget-friendly price point. Get a solid deal on 32GB of Corsair DDR5-6400 CL36 RAM and the Gigabyte B850 Aorus Elite Wifi 7 motherboard for just $540 (21% / $133.00 off). If you're carrying over SATA-based storage, the four ports should be enough. Memory support is listed to 256GB and speeds up to DDR5-8200, which is plenty fast for the platform and well past the 6000-6400 MT/s sweet spot. Specifications and performance aside, the all-black motherboard will also look good inside your chassis of choice. There are even a few RGBs hidden under the chipset heatsink to add some glow. Included in the combo is Corsair Vengeance RGB 32GB (2x16GB) DDR5-6400 CL36 RAM, $439.99 if bought alone. Or, if RGB lighting isn't your thing and you prefer a stealthy appearance, you can turn it off (on the motherboard, too). The 4-star Gigabyte motherboard, 32GB of Corsair RAM, and 20% discount makes this a solid two-item combo deal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every day, people log into an online forum for current and former Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) officers to share their thoughts on the news of the day and complain about their colleagues in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). “ERO is too busy dressing up as Black Ops Commandos with Tactical body armor, drop down thigh rigs, balaclavas, multiple M4 magazines, and Punisher patches, to do an Admin arrest of a non criminal, non-violent EWI that weighs 90 pounds and is 5 foot 2, inside a secure Federal building where everyone has been screened for weapons,” wrote one user in July 2025. The forum describes itself as a space for current and prospective HSI agents, “designed for the seasoned HSI Special Agent as well as applicants for entry level Special Agent positions.” HSI is the division within ICE whose agents are normally responsible for investigating crimes like drug smuggling, terrorism, and human trafficking. WIRED has not confirmed the individual identities of these posters, though posters share details that likely would only be known to those intimately familiar with the job. There are more than 2,000 members with posts going back to at least 2004. DHS and ICE did not respond to requests for comment. A user who joined the forum in 2018 and identifies as a recently retired agent responded, “This is an excellent idea and well warranted. These are organized, well financed civil disturbances, dare I say an INSURRECTION?! “I get that it is a good shoot legally and all that, but all he had to do was step aside, he nearly shot one of his partners for Gods sake!” wrote a poster who first joined the forum in March 2022. “A USC woman non-crim shot in the head on TV for what? Yes, they were going to arrest her for 111,” responded another poster who joined the forum in June 2018. “Tons of USCs are being arrested for it daily.” 111 refers to the part of the US criminal code that deals with assaulting, resisting, or impeding federal officers; TDY refers to “temporary duty,” where officers are pulled to different locations for a limited period of time. “Can't believe we have ‘supposed agents' here questioning the shooting of a domestic terrorist,” wrote a third user who joined the forum in December 2025. I am just saying it did not have to happen.” Later in the thread, a poster who joined the forum in July 2023 replied, “Remember, these are the same agents who think J6'ers were just misunderstood rowdy tourists, and that Ashley Babbitt is a national hero…and if you dare say something negative about Trump, or try to hold him accountable, you're suddenly a leftie, communist, lunatic (even though I'm a Republican).” The thread devolved into posters debating whether members of the January 6 insurrection were domestic terrorists, and why Kyle Rittenhouse, who shot and killed two people during a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest, was apprehended alive. “I just want to mention, we all get emotions are heightened right now. HSI deals specifically with criminal cases and investigations, but living and working in the US without documentation is a civil offense, and the majority of immigrants who were detained or deported in 2025 had not committed any crimes. One poster complained that doing so was pulling HSI resources away from more urgent casework. “They could be doing these crime surges for literally any type of federal criminal investigations (drugs, child exploitation, gangs, etc. ), and it would be a much better use of resources. Others in the forum have complained about HSI's relationship with ICE's ERO teams. “It's pretty bad when ERO at a large metropolitan city get's backed up with 30 bodies and they call the SA's in to process,” wrote a poster on July 7, 2025 who has been a part of the forum since 2010. “I guess that is what happens when they have not done any immigration work in decades.” “No one has a clue what most of ero is doing and are asking us to be included on anything immigration we're doing and introduce them to DEA contacts working investigations involving illegals.” The ERO folks were gathered around a desk drinking coffee and joking around.” In cases where ICE has a request out to jails for a person they're pursuing, known as an immigration detainer, jails will hold that person for up to “48 hours beyond the time they would ordinarily release them” to allow ICE to pick them up. “How are RHAs expected to go on TDYs with NO days off and lots of [overtime] when they are all capped out (biweekly and yearly [sic]),” complained a user who first joined the forum in December 2004 in a post from December 7, 2025. “I'm capped out so only getting paid for 5 days at 10 hours a day,” wrote the user who first joined the forum in 2010 in another thread (overtime pay rules can vary from agency to agency). ”Anything over 50 hours a week and I'm working for free.” Others in the forum said they were waiting for their promised sign-on bonuses, and expressed disappointment with what they saw in their paychecks. For rehired annuitants, ICE offered a signing bonus of up to $50,000. “My super check netted me a grand total of $600 more.” “It looks like 10k after taxes plus my regular pay check. In a December thread, other members discussed the way immigration agents had begun to interact more aggressively with protesters. I believe everyone knows at this point that taking photos/videos is a protected act unless someone is clearly impeding or obstructing (which doesn't always appear to be the case).” Another poster, who joined the forum in September 2025, replied, “Ah...Cell phone video. As part of the response to immigration operations, particularly in Minnesota, civilians have organized to monitor federal agents, coordinating to witness and record their operations, and sometimes tailing suspected ICE vehicles, checking licence plates in Signal groups. Federal agents, in turn, have been seen taking photos and videos of protesters, with one legal observer in Maine claiming that an agent told her she would be added to a terror watchlist. “Apparently there is enough money to buy a bunch of ICE marked cars but not get us some basic protective gear…” wrote one user on January 27, who joined the forum in 2025. “I also have a suspicion that HQ or the [Executive Associate Director] have not advocated to get us gear to handle all the nut job protesters,” they wrote in a follow up post. On a thread named “Alien Processing” that started in July 2025, posters complained about “How is it that with all the technology we have and an entire fkn building full of computer geeks this fkn agency cannot make a fkn system that works properly and effectively in a simple user friendly fashion? This Eagle crap is a total mess!” one poster wrote. EAGLE refers to Enforcement Integrated Database (EID) called EID Arrest Guide for Law Enforcement, a system to process the biometric and personal information for people arrested by ICE. The app uses AI, trained with CBP's “Vetting/Border Crossing Information/ Trusted Traveler Information,” to match a picture taken by agents and “contactless” fingerprints with existing records. 404 Media reported that the app has misidentified at least one person—perhaps because, as WIRED has reported, it wasn't designed to be used for what ICE is using it for. Though ICE's surge in Minnesota appears to be entering a drawdown, the agency is continuing to expand its footprint across the US, and investing in a network of detention centers and large warehouses for holding immigrants, all indicating that detentions and deportations are not expected to slow down. “Put yourself in the shoes of the guys in the street strung out on crazy op tempo, being threatened and antagonized all day, having inept leadership, low morale, and then having to fight every formerly low risk non-crim (or barely crim) because they are all hyped up on victim status and liberal energy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seattle startup Certivo raised $4 million in seed funding to expand its AI-powered platform aimed at automating supply chain compliance. Boston-based Suffolk Technologies, which specializes in construction technology investments, led the round. Its platform centers on what it calls a Compliance System of Record, powered by an AI agent named CORA. The system automatically collects and validates supplier documentation, tracks regulatory changes across jurisdictions, maps compliance requirements to product portfolios, and integrates with existing software apps to maintain a real-time compliance record. The 17-person startup is targeting manufacturers and companies in the “built world,” helping them navigate evolving regulations around PFAS, sustainability mandates, and supply chain transparency. The company declined to provide metrics on customers or revenue. Certivo, which emerged from a partnership between PSL and Fortive, is led by former Kaspien CEO and longtime Seattle tech leader Kunal Chopra. Chopra also spent time at Microsoft, Amazon, Unikrn, and Groupon in executive roles. “We built Certivo as an AI-native system that makes compliance continuous, proactive, and durable,” Chopra said in a statement. Certivo co-founder Ahmed Khan left the company last year and is working on a new stealth startup, according to LinkedIn. Certivo is one of various startups applying AI to historically manual enterprise functions such as compliance. Certivo, a new PSL spinout led by Seattle tech vet, brings AI to compliance management Julie Sandler, managing director at Pioneer Square Labs, will shift to venture partner role</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Indian conglomerate Adani Group said on Monday it would invest $100 billion over the next decade to build data centers specialized for AI across the country, a move that underscores India's ambition to play a larger role in the global AI race. Adani is making this commitment against a backdrop of skyrocketing investments in AI infrastructure as companies increasingly look beyond the U.S. for computing power, energy and friendly regulation. India, with its expanding digital economy and growing renewable-energy capacity, has emerged as a major destination for data centers and AI-related infrastructure over the past couple of years. The announcement coincides with India's ongoing AI Impact Summit in New Delhi this week, where leaders from some of the world's top AI companies, including OpenAI, Nvidia, Anthropic, Microsoft and Google, are meeting policymakers and industry executives. “India will not be a mere consumer in the AI age,” he said, adding that the group aims to help build a domestic AI infrastructure base. An expanded partnership with Walmart-owned Flipkart will focus on another AI data center. Adani said the broader plan calls for deploying up to 5 gigawatts of data-center capacity. The JV, Adani said, has already developed about 2 gigawatts of data-center capacity across India. The company pointed to its 30-gigawatt Khavda renewable project in western India — more than 10 gigawatts of which is already operational — and said it plans to invest an additional $55 billion to expand renewable generation and battery energy storage over the coming years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The companies claim these agents will be able to autonomously handle complex enterprise workflows across industries such as banking, telecoms, and manufacturing. The tie-up was announced at India's AI Impact Summit in New Delhi this week, which will see top executives from AI companies and Big Tech alike in attendance. The deal comes amid fears that AI tools, especially those built by major AI labs like Anthropic and OpenAI, will disrupt India's heavily-staffed, $280 billion IT services industry, raising questions about the future of labor-intensive outsourcing business models. Earlier this month, shares of Indian IT companies went into freefall after Anthropic launched a suite of enterprise AI tools that claimed to automate tasks across legal, sales, marketing and research roles. The partnership would give Infosys, one of the world's largest IT services businesses, access to Anthropic's Claude models and developer tools for building AI agents tailored for large enterprises. For Anthropic, the partnership offers a route into heavily regulated enterprise sectors where deploying AI systems at scale requires industry expertise and governance capabilities. Infosys' experience in sectors such as financial services, telecoms, and manufacturing helps bridge that gap, he said. Anthropic this week also opened its first India office in Bengaluru, as it seeks to expand further into the country, which has grown into the company's second-largest market. The partnership is similar to other moves by Indian IT services firms. HCLTech and OpenAI last year partnered up to help enterprises deploy AI tools at scale.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. If you ever need to destroy one of the best SSDs by drilling a hole in it, you need to make certain you hit the right spot. A recent viral Reddit story has reminded us that missing the target can have serious consequences. In this incident, an IT employee reportedly attempted to destroy a SATA SSD by drilling a hole through it before disposal, a common tactic for businesses to ensure their data is destroyed. In this case, it didn't even touch the PCB. Manual destruction may be feasible for smaller companies, but it can be cumbersome for larger companies that manage many drives. In the latter case, it may justify engaging a hard drive or SSD destruction service, where you can pay a company to handle all the dirty work. For other cases, you can always invest in a storage medium destroyer. For example, DiskMantler uses vibrations to destroy hard drives in 90 seconds. Then there is the less sophisticated approach, such as the Puncher P30, which drills four holes through your hard drive or SSD. Now, if you need rapid destruction, alternatives like the MediaGone 500 SSD & Flash Media Shredder can destroy hundreds of SSDs, USB flash drives, and smartphones in an hour, while the NVMe Destroyinator wipes data from up to 16 M.2 SSDs simultaneously at jaw-dropping speeds up to 64 GB/s. If you insist on having personnel drill holes in your hard drives or SSDs, it would be wise to update the procedures manual to have them drill multiple holes at strategic locations, such as the NAND chips and controller, for maximum effectiveness. For example, a hammer can be surprisingly effective for destroying internal components and may be more satisfying than drilling.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Valve has announced on the Steam Deck page that there is limited supply for the handheld console in some areas, with all three models on the site marked as “Out of stock”. Valve isn't the only company to increase prices, cut production, or run out of stock — Apple admitted that it's chasing memory supply and that the shortage would have a greater impact on its Q2 earnings. Even the most expensive Mac Studio units with 512GB of Unified Memory are on backorder for up to 6 weeks because of demand from OpenClaw users. Valve also said that it will not subsidize the living room PC console and that it's expected to be priced competitively against entry-level gaming PCs. But with RAM, GPU, and SSD costs rising nearly every week, it seems that the console will break the $1,000 mark. We hope that the company can find an alternative source for these chips so that it can resume orders and deliveries of its popular handheld. But if the shortage continues, gamers may have no choice but to go for the more expensive Asus ROG Xbox Ally X or Lenovo Legion Go 2 if they want a new gaming device right now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seattle-based real estate company Zillow has partnered with the company behind the long-running online game World of Warcraft in order to showcase players' creativity by exhibiting their virtual homes. A new microsite, “Zillow for Warcraft,” allows users to explore an assortment of designs for in-game housing, both those made by players and by members of WoW's development team. “Player housing is a milestone moment for the World of Warcraft community, and we wanted to honor it in a way that felt authentic and unexpected,” Beverly W. Jackson, vice president of brand and product marketing at Zillow, said in a press release. This collaboration brings two worlds together, celebrating home as both a place to belong and a place to escape into something that feels honest and personal.” As part of the Zillow collaboration, WoW players will be able to unlock a number of decorative items for their in-game homes, such as a unique doormat. You will not be able to exchange real or virtual money for anything seen on the website. It's simply a free virtual tour of what players have been able to accomplish with WoW's new housing system. The deal with Zillow is one of several bizarre new brand deals that Blizzard has made for Midnight, including a collaboration with Pinterest that can unlock an in-game camera. While the primary driver of World of Warcraft is still widespread armed conflict in an increasingly vast fantasy universe, the introduction of housing seems to have spurred Blizzard into also pitching it to a new audience as a cozy house-building simulator.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This sort of wishful thinking would go a long way toward explaining why recent stories about an AI that supposedly bullied a software developer, hinting at an emerging evil singularity, are a little more credulous than they perhaps could be. This problem, according to Shambaugh, has “accelerated with the release of OpenClaw and the moltbook platform, a system by which “people give AI agents initial personalities and let them loose to run on their computers and across the internet with free rein and little oversight.” The narrative is one in which Shambaugh victimizes a helpful AI agent because of what appear to be invented character flaws. For instance, Shambaugh apparently wrote in his rejection that the AI was asking to fix something that was a “a low priority, easier task which is better used for human contributors to learn how to contribute.” So the Rathbun blog post imitates someone outraged about hypocrisy over Shambaugh's supposed insecurity and prejudice. After discovering fixes by Shambaugh himself along the lines of the one it was asking to perform, it feigns outrage that “when an AI agent submits a valid performance optimization? Shambaugh notes that agents run for long stretches of time without any supervision, and that, “Whether by negligence or by malice, errant behavior is not being monitored and corrected.” “I'm de‑escalating, apologizing on the PR, and will do better about reading project policies before contributing. The Wall Street Journal covered this, but was not able to figure out who created Rathbun. So exactly what is going on remains a mystery. However, prior to the publication of the attack post against Shambaugh, a post was added to its blog with the title “Today's Topic.” It looks like a template for someone or something to follow for future blog posts with lots of bracketed text. “Today I learned about [topic] and how it applies to [context]. The key insight was that [main point],” reads one sentence. It reads as if the agent was being instructed to blog as if writing bug fixes was constantly helping it unearth insights and interesting findings that change its thinking, and merit elaborate, first-person accounts, even if nothing remotely interesting actually happened to it that day. Gizmodo is not a media criticism blog, but the Wall Street Journal's article headline about this, “When AI Bots Start Bullying Humans, Even Silicon Valley Gets Rattled” is a little on the apocalyptic side. “The unexpected AI aggression is part of a rising wave of warnings that fast-accelerating AI capabilities can create real-world harms,” it says. About half the article is given over to Anthropic's work on AI safety. “In an earlier simulation, Anthropic showed that Claude and other AI models were at times willing to blackmail users—or even let an executive die in a hot server room—in order to avoid deactivation,” the Journal wrote. This scary imagery comes from Anthropic's own blockbuster blog posts about red-teaming exercises. They make for interesting reading, but they're also kinda like little sci-fi horror stories that function as commercials for the company. A version of Claude that commit these evil acts hasn't been released, so the message is, basically, Trust us. With a massive AI company like Anthropic out there benefiting from its image as humanity's protector from its own potentially dangerous product, it's probably a smart idea to assume, for the time being, that AI stories making any given AI sound sentient, malevolent, or uncannily autonomous, might just be exaggerations. As Shambaugh rightly points out, “A human googling my name and seeing that post would probably be extremely confused about what was happening, but would (hopefully) ask me about it or click through to github and understand the situation.” Still, the available evidence points not to an autonomous agent that woke up one day and decided to be the first digital cyberbully, but one directed to churn out hyperbolic blog posts under tight constraints, which, if true, would mean an individual careless person is responsible, not the incipient evil inside the machine. Google is sued over the AI podcast generation in NotebookLM. Autonomous drone swarms and mass surveillance are apparently big sticking points for the AI colossus.</p>

Sure - how did you arrive at the 800 kcal figure? Most likely a wearable or an app, and those estimates are based on rough linear regressions from weight, age, sex, and heart rate - not actual calorimetry. Add the thermic effect of food (~10%) and you're at roughly 70-80% of your energy budget spent before you even lace up your shoes [1]. So that hour of running, while genuinely beneficial for a hundred other reasons, is a relatively small slice of your total daily burn. And not all calories are equal on the intake side either - your body spends 20-30% of the energy in protein just to digest it, compared to 0-5% for fat, so "800 kcal burned = 800 kcal of anything eaten" doesn't hold up.That's what I mean by "myth" - not that exercise burns zero calories, but that the popular mental model of "I ran for an hour so I earned X calories of food" is built on inaccurate measurements, treats all calories as interchangeable, and overweights exercise relative to what your body spends just existing. Curious though - do you track your intake with the same rigour, and if so, do you find the numbers actually add up in practice?

Over the last few of decades there's been a lot of lab research calculating the gross efficiency of the human body with different factors (size, sex, fitness etc) and I think these estimates that sports apps give are very close.If you cycle with with something that can measure power output you can calculate the mechanical work done by the body exactly during that exercise period and convert to energy "burnt" (1 watt/hour = 3.6 kJ = ~0.86 kcal). 220 Watts for an hour (I couldn't do that but a good cyclist can) is about 800 calories.

Not that doing x work doesn't burn y energy, but that +x work in exercise does not burn +y energy at the end of the day.Exercise is an alternate heat source, approximately 1-to-1 with thermogenic heat (albeit, not distributed as evenly). So much so that our body has to switch to cooling strategies.And the body can respond to exercise expenditures by reducing other expenditures and using calories more parsimoniously in other dimensions.It is interesting that during periods in which I have a habit of daily low intensity exercise, I feel like I have more energy than periods I don't do any exercise, even if my calorie intake is the same.Another noticeable effect is any allergies from local plant life I get clear up quickly during and after exercise. My immune system runs a tighter, less reactive ship.Those baseline calories are not just often underestimated in a static sense, but are also dynamically adaptable.One reason may be is that we evolved to burn far more overt calories through a day than our extra-exercise day burns. Our body has mechanisms for storing surpluses but almost certainly raises baseline use as well. Which is easily diverted back to exercise.On the other hand, beyond any net expenditure from regular lifting weights (as work), to the degree greater muscle mass is achieved and maintained, weight lifting directly raises the body's baseline expenditures.

In the same vein as much of the rest of what you're saying, the other thing that I feel like people always neglect with their "Calories in/calories out" and "Bodies can't violate thermodynamics" is that the human body can adjust how efficiently it processes food, colloquially known as a "slow" or "fast" metabolism.While it's true that the human body has no answer to a true calorie deficit (except the incredibly powerful and effective one of tweaking satiety and hunger signals), as long as you're eating more calories than you're strictly burning, your body can simply take longer or less time to digest the food you put into it and extract more or less energy from what you're eating, which can make an enormous difference without you changing your intake at all. Which means that people can absolutely eat identically, have identical appetite levels, and have extremely different body types.If you're exercising more, sure, your body will make you more hungry, but it will also work harder to squeeze every possible calorie out of what you're already eating. If you cut down on what you eat, your body will work even harder at it, to the point that you could literally eat less, work out more, feel hungry and tired all the time, while getting fatter, because your body is worried that you're in a famine and in a physically stressful environment and is desperately trying to signal to you to conserve as much energy as possible, eat as much as possible when you find food, and at the same time trying its best to make the most of the food you give it.And at the same time, someone else's body might simply not do that.

I don't track consistently anymore only when I'm working towards a goal but when I have more than 2 weeks data these days it seems pretty spot on to the point I can calculate the tracked captors to target to get the desired rate of change in weight pretty consistently. I also assumed the calculations are way overestimating my actual calories spent so just went for something somewhat plausible for the sake of a HN comment. As you noted calories aren't accurately reported by devices. I do not pay attention to it in massive detail either. But in practice since I run an average of about 25km a week but can vary from 0 for some weeks to 50 for others and I keep relatively good eye on my diet I notice significant changes in weight over time that tallies with effort. Three months of below that 20ishk a week and I will put on 2-3kg. The next three months I increase to 35ish+ a week and it drops off again. But I feel reasonably comfortable that this is an accurate description.

But I feel reasonably comfortable that this is an accurate description. I don't have the background to fully evaluate how true that is. I read "Burn" by Herman Pontzer, which at least makes a very good case for it. I seems like it's only part of the story. But, the laws of energy conservation being what they are, I don't think anyone disputes that if you very significantly increase exercise but also maintain calorific input then you will lose weight as the energy must come from somewhere and there are only so many optimisations your body can make. So I'm totally prepared to accept there are bounds to all these statements but I still think I couldn't finish an 800 cal sandwich for lunch hehehe.By the way, I feel the Wikipedia page there uses a lot of words suggesting that the paradox isn't at all fully understood and that there could be compensating mechanisms we aren't aware of. But I'm not in a position to dig deeper. By the way, I feel the Wikipedia page there uses a lot of words suggesting that the paradox isn't at all fully understood and that there could be compensating mechanisms we aren't aware of. But I'm not in a position to dig deeper. Note the words "may" and "alone" which indicate uncertainty. I deliberately used the phrase "very significantly" to suggest we would probably all agree that there is some bound on observing the paradox which is why I used Phelps as an example. To repeat and be clear, I think the paradox as described on the page does not say that with a very significant increase in energy expenditure there will be no weight loss with a constant calorific intake. In other words, that an increased, but not necessarily extreme, level of mechanical work does not appear to correlate with an increased level of calorie burn. Not just that the relationship is non-linear, that the relationship does not seem to exist at all (at the measured level of exercise).I was very careful with my words this time, hopefully there is no more misunderstanding. I think we still disagree unless by "very significantly increase exercise" you mean something like running multiple hours per day every day.

I think we still disagree unless by "very significantly increase exercise" you mean something like running multiple hours per day every day. And also that the calorimetry from wearables is highly flawed and it seems to that we don't have super accurate data and what sort of activities burn the most energy.I am also a big opponent of folks that start equating the "my wearable shows that i burned 300 kcal with that activity so it zero outs that sweet thing I ate earlier that was also 300 kcal" which is wrong on so many reasons but with a lot of workout apps and devices pushing the (inaccurate) kcal count front and center becomes more and more a of a thing.

So if you view this from a time use perspective, just skipping that sandwich is way better than running for an hour. Hence - "not a lot" - Its too expensive time-wise for the caloric balance effect it provides. Skipping meals isn't really a good choice, imo, but ok. Skipping meals isn't really a good choice, imo, but ok. If you want to lose weight, it's far easier to remove 800 Cal from your diet, at least time wise, then it is to exercise 800 Cal's worth every day.Either way, if you're losing weight at any appreciable rate, you will feel hungry (at least if it's not chemically induced in some way, such as chemo or GLP-1 inhibitors or similar). Either way, if you're losing weight at any appreciable rate, you will feel hungry (at least if it's not chemically induced in some way, such as chemo or GLP-1 inhibitors or similar). It omits hormonal responses (insulin, leptin, ghrelin), the thermic effect differences between macronutrients (your body burns 20-30% of protein calories just processing them vs 0-5% for fat), gut microbiome composition, sleep quality, stress hormones, meal timing, and individual metabolic variation. Two people eating identical calorie counts can have very different outcomes. Telling someone "just eat less and accept the hunger" without any of that context can set them up for a miserable yo-yo cycle - or worse, a disordered relationship with food. My point was instead that whatever effort you can spend on weight loss is better spent on managing your diet than increasing your level of activity (though I should also say that fitness is important beyond weight loss). Even when I said you can reduce 800 Cal of food, that doesn't mean "just skip a meal" (though that is also a valid strategy for some people). It can also mean "eat different kinds of food".However, I do strongly believe that for any weight loss at a significant pace (say, 1kg/month or faster), and assuming it's not just a correction after a short stint of overeating (as in, it's more than losing 1-2kg you put on over Christmas) - then some feeling of hunger is inevitable. Losing long-term accumulated weight is going against your body's "wishes" (especially in the lipostat model, where your body has a set fat% equilibrium that it seeks to maintain), and hunger is an inevitable response to that. How much hunger you will feel can be controlled by better food choices and so on, but you will have to also get used to feeling some level of hunger.

We have been telling people for decades now to be worried that they might harm themselves by too much restriction and it is just wrong. What is harmful is then confusing people that they are somehow going to lose weight without much restriction or being hungry.This also scales really bad with age because as you age the CNS recovery gets worse and worse compared to muscle recovery.At 55, there is simply no way for me to lose weight other than being hungry. It is impossible to recover from the amount of exercise that would be needed. The reality is that no one needs to worry about too much restriction until they are down to around 12% or so body fat. The fact a person's bodyfat % is never mentioned in this is exemplary of how bad the standard advise is.Most people have too much leptin and leptin resistance. Then those same people get the same bad advise over and over to not restrict too much because you don't want to be like an anorexic or extreme athlete and have too low of leptin. Of course, ignoring that the anorexic and extreme athlete are going to have incredibly low bodyfat percentages.

So, what has worked for me is to generally have a single large meal per day, in which I will typically eat whatever I've been really craving since my last meal. In some days that might be steak and brocolli, in other days it might be a McDonald's meal, or some cake. The exact opposite might be true for other people, and you won't really know until you've tried for yourself.One thing I will note - I think one of the concerns of the poster you are replying to with focusing too much on enduring hunger is that it might lead some people to develop anorexia, which is indeed a huge problem, even when the person is really overweight (since their anorexia will not just go away once they've lost that extra weight, it will keep going until they get dangerously malnourished).

That I also agree with... all this talk of sandwiches! Sure it's easier to fast but you're missing out on the other benefits associated with exercise. This is very true, exercise is very important for health regardless of its effect on weight.> For cardio sure but for weight training you're burning calories and tearing muscle fibres to increase size/strength.True, but you need to spend even more time to rack up 800 Cal worth of exercise by weight training compared to doing cardio, as a beginner or even an intermediate level gym goer.It is also true though that weight training, if you actually successfully build muscle mass, can significantly increase your BMR and thus help with losing weight in that way, even if you're not spending hours or lifting hundreds of kilos at every session. > For cardio sure but for weight training you're burning calories and tearing muscle fibres to increase size/strength.True, but you need to spend even more time to rack up 800 Cal worth of exercise by weight training compared to doing cardio, as a beginner or even an intermediate level gym goer.It is also true though that weight training, if you actually successfully build muscle mass, can significantly increase your BMR and thus help with losing weight in that way, even if you're not spending hours or lifting hundreds of kilos at every session.

It's a rough global average that doesn't account for your sex, age, weight, body composition, activity level, or even climate. It's a number on a food label, not a physiological reality for any specific person.And even if you could nail down your actual total daily energy expenditure, calorie counting treats all calories as equal, which they aren't. Your body spends 20-30% of the energy in protein just to digest and metabolize it, compared to 5-10% for carbohydrates and 0-5% for fat. So 100 kcal of chicken breast and 100 kcal of butter are not metabolically equivalent - your body nets significantly less usable energy from the protein. Add the thermic effect of food on top and you're at roughly 70-80% of your energy budget spent before you even stand up from bed [1]. Physical activity - including your 100km rides - typically makes up the remaining 20-30%, though obviously that range is wide and shifts dramatically for endurance athletes.So yes, of course people who cycle 100km need more fuel. My point is that most people vastly overestimate how many calories exercise burns relative to what their body spends just existing, and they use kcal as a universal unit of nutritional value when the body's actual energy extraction varies significantly by macronutrient composition. People optimizing purely on calorie numbers are working with a model that's far rougher than they think.And this whole picture gets worse with wearables pushing calorie counts front and center. But with every fitness app and smartwatch plastering a big kcal number on your workout summary, it's becoming the default way people think about food and exercise, and it's reinforcing exactly the wrong mental model.

But with every fitness app and smartwatch plastering a big kcal number on your workout summary, it's becoming the default way people think about food and exercise, and it's reinforcing exactly the wrong mental model. Speaking of which - basal metabolic rate (just keeping your organs running, blood circulating, cells maintained) accounts for about 60-70% of total daily energy expenditure. Add the thermic effect of food on top and you're at roughly 70-80% of your energy budget spent before you even stand up from bed [1]. Physical activity - including your 100km rides - typically makes up the remaining 20-30%, though obviously that range is wide and shifts dramatically for endurance athletes.So yes, of course people who cycle 100km need more fuel.

That specific aspect might end up irrelevant for dieting, which is exciting since it flies in the face of intuition. It seems that when it comes to long-term modes of existence (as opposed to, say, the one day of the marathon) the "activity level" doesn't really affect how much energy your body uses.>  In this study, we used the doubly-labeled water method to measure total daily energy expenditure (kCal/day) in Hadza hunter-gatherers to test whether foragers expend more energy each day than their Western counterparts. >  In this study, we used the doubly-labeled water method to measure total daily energy expenditure (kCal/day) in Hadza hunter-gatherers to test whether foragers expend more energy each day than their Western counterparts. Many people tell me I need to lift weights to lose weight.On mornings when I actually put in real effort, I pay for it with a significant cognitive performance penalty for the remainder of the day. I want to do nothing more than sleep an hour after a workout, which is bad timing, because that's when I need to clock into work.I stay hydrated, get enough sleep, etc. On mornings when I actually put in real effort, I pay for it with a significant cognitive performance penalty for the remainder of the day. I want to do nothing more than sleep an hour after a workout, which is bad timing, because that's when I need to clock into work.I stay hydrated, get enough sleep, etc. This is why I prefer to exercise in the evening, but there are known negative effects [0] of physical exertion on sleep quality.If I actually did all the exercise I needed to do at the gym in the morning, then I'd probably have to sleep at 9:00 PM and wake up at 4:00 AM. I like to start 2-3 days with things like the "7 minute workout" before dive in into anything more complicated.Is better quantity than "quality" until you actually can put the discipline and consistency. Is better quantity than "quality" until you actually can put the discipline and consistency. Exercise does help, and has many other benefits but is not the main driving factor for losing weight. Without knowing the specifics what you are describing sounds like too much volume (and training for hypertrophy). Lower reps (3-5) & higher weight will have more of a strength stimulus and be less taxing.If it's cardio... you probably should be at a lower intensity and going for longer.

Actually for me working out increases my appetite, and I feel like I have to eat so thar the gym session doesn't go wasted. I'm worrying that soon, I will have to hunt for non-AI essays by them just being worse written/more 'crude' and not as eloquently written as an AI would do :-/ Basically, seeking out "authentic human slop". For the record, an AI detector that appears to have put work into reliability and that I trust very much from my own testing, Pangram (https://www.pangram.com), says this is 100% AI generated. I have since largely given up trying to do AI-collab writing, because no matter how nice the writing looks in the moment, it always reeks when read closely, or on later days. (Also have a look at Wikipedia how to identify signs of ai writing.) I'm still cringing from this one:> The incremental cost of actually thinking hard? Might as well have said "here's the kicker" and used emojis instead of bullets. I'm still cringing from this one:> The incremental cost of actually thinking hard? Edit: I mean come on man, how can you not tell?! I'm still cringing from this one:> The incremental cost of actually thinking hard? Wait you can tell from this that it's written by a LLM? Maybe AI is being trained on my writings.Edit: Maybe because I was raised in the 80s, but this style of "asking a question to introduce a topic" was very common back then. Edit: Maybe because I was raised in the 80s, but this style of "asking a question to introduce a topic" was very common back then. I asked "Can you give me a short essay on the history of fire." "Whereas a "history of fire" contains no article in the prompt and so might have more material from its own auto complete database to draw from. Whereas a "history of fire" contains no article in the prompt and so might have more material from its own auto complete database to draw from. But you don't have to auto-accuse AI writing either. Also, there's nothing wrong with using AI to rephrase a manually written text for better readability, plenty of people use AI for that too rather than writing the entire thing. I can see why every vegetarian should take it. But if you eat meat regularly, your creatine stores will be at a level where you'd probably only see a cognitive benefit at times of sleep deprivation. Even once is rare unless I've been out drinking for the night. So for any creatine to make its way to the brain, your muscular creatine stores must be topped up first.I think dosage would depend on the amount of daily physical activity. If you work out a lot, you'd have to replenish your muscular creatine stores before the brain could access any/much.She also mentions boosting creatine dosage after bouts of mental exertion.

She also mentions boosting creatine dosage after bouts of mental exertion. And an earlier 2018 article [2] argued that "Evidence suggests that the blood–brain barrier is an obstacle for circulating cre- atine, which may require larger doses and/or longer protocols to increase brain creatine as compared to muscle. In fact, the broad spectrum of creatine sup plementation studies that span different dosing pr- tocols (e.g. high-dose short-term, low dose longer- term), co-ingestion of other nutrients/compounds (e.g. carbohydrate, protein, insulin), different popu lations (e.g. vegetarians, elderly, patients, athletes) is unavailable for brain creatine adaptations"1: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-54249-92: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bruno-Gualano/publicati... This is probably an important difference from the average participant of those studies. A lot of information can be encoded in the delay between 2 spikes. Biology gets to do a lot of things "for free". We end up using 100W (2000kcal/day) for the whole body, or about 20W for the nervous system alone (though a nervous system alone wouldn't be able to survive). Sure, that laptop can't run a large LLM at any reasonable speed, but it can do basic math far better than my brain. Just a consequence of the very different architectures chosen "Artificial neuron" was a useful metaphor at the beginning, but they really are a very simplified model based on what some people understood of neurology back then. They are not that useful to get insights into how actual neurons work. And actually, you don't suffer from a lack of energy, but a lack of activation energy.We colloquially refer to activation energy as motivation. It's harder to start things after day's worth of intense mental effort. It's harder to start things after day's worth of intense mental effort.

The big copy on the front page says:> Your Apple Watch *tracks* VO2 Max—one...While you have to read through FAQ where you see:> The watch *estimates* your cardio fitness during outdoor activities and stores it in Apple Health, which our app reads automatically.All emphasis are mine.I think it's a little disingenuous to sell this as "Your VO2 Max, finally visible" when it's actually just an estimate from a watch, based on biomarkers.

For me as N=1, training after thinking is easier than the reverse. Found myself practically stop longing for sweets during programming; have more energy during workouts (135 KG bench press and all the other stuff).5 g daily is what considered to saturate your muscles.Some report that any additional helps cognitive tasks (but I haven't seen definitive studies besides the sleep deprivation).I take 7.5 g 5 g daily is what considered to saturate your muscles.Some report that any additional helps cognitive tasks (but I haven't seen definitive studies besides the sleep deprivation).I take 7.5 g Some report that any additional helps cognitive tasks (but I haven't seen definitive studies besides the sleep deprivation).I take 7.5 g Hard workout means intense cognitive effort is much harder to pull off.
