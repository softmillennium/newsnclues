                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the most rewarding parts of stepping into my role as WTA Chair has been witnessing firsthand the momentum behind women's tennis, driven by our world-class players, incredible tournaments and dedicated fans. The 2026 season is off to a strong start, with elite competition and enthusiastic global fan engagement setting the stage for an exciting year and continued growth. As Chair, it is my priority to help the WTA capitalize on this momentum and opportunity for the benefit of our members. It's important we take a fresh, collaborative look at how to best preserve the high-quality competition that builds value for tournaments and provides an unparalleled experience for fans. This group's initial mandate is to develop actionable recommendations for consideration by the WTA Board that can be implemented as soon as the 2027 season. The Council includes prominent voices from across the global tennis ecosystem, including players from around the world; leaders from premier tournaments across the Americas, Europe, and Asia; and WTA senior leadership -- including myself -- Tour CEO Portia Archer, and experts in Tour operations and calendar planning. The Council will be chaired by current World No. As Chair, Jessica brings an active top-player perspective to the Council's work. She will help guide discussions so they reflect the full range of different player experiences on Tour, while working alongside tournament representatives and WTA leadership as the group works to turn these perspectives into action. I am grateful to Jessica and all of the members of the Council for committing their valuable time and expertise to this important effort. The WTA is uniquely positioned to do this work. Our structure allows us to bring together athletes and tournaments to make decisions impacting the future of our sport. For more than 50 years, this model has resulted in our players being recognized as some of the most renowned and highly compensated athletes in the world, and enabled global expansion for the Tour at an unprecedented level, with attendance and viewership surging. Women's tennis is a global growth engine for our sport, and the WTA is well-equipped to respond with clarity and purpose to today's realities and help position the Tour for continued success. I am grateful to serve as Chair at this important moment, and I look forward to working together to make informed and aligned decisions that support our athletes and the long-term strength of women's tennis. Thank you for your continued engagement and commitment to our sport. The Player Class Representatives include former World No. The Tournament Representatives are Chief Operating Officer and Co-Tournament Director at APG Laura Ceccarelli, Managing Director of Octagon Tennis Alastair Garland and President of Beemok Sports & Entertainment Bob Moran. "The Tour Architecture Council brings together a representative group of players and tournaments who will work with WTA leadership to turn feedback into collective improvements to the Tour framework. The Council is structured to ensure a wide range of perspectives directly inform the process, and I'm especially grateful that Jessica Pegula has agreed to be Chair. "This is a chance to focus on specific parts of the Tour structure and see what can be addressed in the short-term, while continuing the conversation on longer-term improvements in a dedicated, focused way. The WTA has the opportunity and standing to bring a group like this together and I'm grateful they're using that power to advance real change for 2027." I look forward to helping make actionable recommendations that will drive growth and benefit the entire ecosystem." This global group of top players and tournaments will work with WTA leaders to develop recommendations that reflect a range of perspectives, with the goal of preserving the high-quality competition that builds value for tournaments and delivers an unparalleled experience for fans. As Valerie noted in her announcement letter, the current 'momentum and opportunity' in our sport provides a timely backdrop for advancing real change for our members."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Could Alejandro Tabilo be poised for a big week on clay in Brazil? The Chilean lefty made a good start to his Rio Open presented by Claro on Monday when he ousted American Emilio Nava 6-3, 6-3 in only 63 minutes. Tabilo is fresh off a run to the quarter-finals at the ATP 250 event in Buenos Aires, where he beat Joao Fonseca. The victor claimed 86 per cent of his service points according to Infosys ATP Stats and did not face a break point against the American. Tabilo will next play qualifier Dino Prizmic or lucky loser Francesco Passaro. German Yannick Hanfmann also came out of the gates well with a 7-6(3), 6-4 triumph against Brazilian wild card Joao Lucas Reis Da Silva. Getting through a tough first match playing a Brazilian on the centre court is not the easiest task,” Hanfmann said. I served quite well, tried to stay composed throughout the whole match. Serbian Dusan Lajovic, an ATP Masters 1000 finalist on clay at Monte-Carlo in 2019, earned his first Lexus ATP Head2Head series win against Daniel Altmaier 6-4, 7-6(7). Other players who advanced on the first day of the main draw were Thiago Agustin Tirante, a 7-5, 6-3 winner against Cristian Garin, and Ignacio Buse, who rallied past qualifier Igor Marcondes 4-6, 7-5, 6-4. Vit Kopriva also reached the second round with a 6-2, 7-6(5) victory against wild card Gustavo Heide. In the only doubles match of the day, Brazilian sensation Joao Fonseca partnered countryman Marcelo Melo past alternates Roman Andres Burruchaga and Andrea Pellegrino 6-4, 6-4. It was the first tour-level doubles win of Fonseca's career. Get official marketing communications from the ATP and WTA!

Obviously I feel like Mercedes is a great brand, been around forever," Gauff, 21, said Sunday on media day. "They built their status on that side of the world. "I think for me to be able to represent that at such a young age, I think is pretty cool for me.
