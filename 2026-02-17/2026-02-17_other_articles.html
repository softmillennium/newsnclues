                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Washington: An American filmmaker and conservative activist who claims Barack Obama's real father was a communist poet and that Michelle Obama “is not who she pretends to be” will address a conference in Australia hosted by rising right-wing lobby group Advance. Joel Gilbert is a regular contributor to far-right conspiracy theory media outlets such as Alex Jones' Infowars and fake news website The Gateway Pundit, where he is currently pushing the claim that a candidate for governor of California is ineligible for that office. One of Gilbert's films explores the urban legend that the Beatles' Paul McCartney died in 1966 and was replaced by a lookalike, though he now calls it a “mockumentary”. He has also made a conspiratorial film about the killing of African-American teenager Trayvon Martin. Gilbert is being flown into Australia by Advance to be a key speaker at a conference in Sydney, alongside former prime minister Tony Abbott and Liberal MP Moira Deeming. He is billed to make a half-hour speech on Saturday morning titled: “The quiet coup: how judicial politicisation threatens democratic society.” He confirmed Advance was paying for his travel to Australia. Questioned on his claims that Obama's real father was Frank Marshall Davis, a communist poet and friend of Obama's grandfather, Gilbert said: “I don't have the DNA, but certainly the photos bear it out.” Advance did not respond to inquiries about how much it was paying Gilbert to appear, and whether that was the best use of donors' money. Disclosure records show Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting was the lobby group's largest donor in 2024-25, making two payments totalling $895,000. While in Australia, Gilbert will also appear at NSW Parliament for a screening of his 2018 film Trump: The Art of the Insult – an event being sponsored by Libertarian Party MP John Ruddick. His film about Al Gore – in which he interviews an AI version of the former Democratic vice president – made its “world premiere” at the 2024 Conservative Political Action Conference in Brisbane. In January, while appearing on far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones's program Infowars, Gilbert called the Albanese government “radical far-left” and spoke disparagingly about Muslim immigration. They have the same in the UK … It's hard to get a united western front when half of your best allies are far-left and believe in this idea of DEI and inclusivity,” he said. “They don't really understand the big picture of what it means to bring large populations of Muslims into your country, and not understanding that they have a different way of life, a different political goal and a different value system than your society does.” Get a note directly from our foreign correspondents on what's making headlines around the world.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UFOs are back in the headlines following a recent interview with Barack Obama. It's time to ask again how many New Jersey residents believe in them. We conducted an informal survey over the past few days to see how many people believe in unidentified flying objects, aliens, and abductions, and you might be surprised by the results. It is a far cry from believing there are unidentified craft in our skies as compared to little grey or green beings walking around our planet. We asked New Jersey residents inan informal survey their thoughts on UFOs, and here is what we learned. Here are the results from our unscientific survey. We asked random state residents and listeners to my radio show if they believed in the following three things, and here are the percentages of people who said they do. Nearly half of New Jersey residents think they are among us. According to the National UFO Reporting Center, there have been three UFO sightings in New Jersey in 2026. They were reported in Chatham, Atlantic City, and Bridgewater.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The former president was forced to clarify his comments after an interview with Brian Tyler Cohen Former President Barack Obama sat down with influencer Brian Tyler Cohen for a friendly conversation that centered on the political divisions roiling the country, but there was one exchange that seemed to unite disparate factions, at least temporarily, in a shared excitement: the moment Obama seemed to confirm the existence of aliens. “Are aliens real?” Cohen asked the former president point-blank. Obama posted the alien clip to his own Instagram account on Sunday evening, but tamped down enthusiasm for his comments in the caption. “But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we've been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. With those numbers, the odds are heavily in favor of the possibility that life is out there — just very far away. The absolute closest galaxy to ours, the Andromeda Galaxy, is roughly 2.5 million lightyears away; the 100,000 galaxies that make up our next closest neighbors exist in a “cosmic suburb” that spans roughly 520 million lightyears of outer space. Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri arrives at the Los Angeles Superior Court before testifying on Feb. 11, 2026. Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, appeared in a Los Angeles courtroom Wednesday as an “adverse witness” in a landmark trial over claims that Meta's Instagram and Google's YouTube functioned as “digital casinos,” dispensing dopamine-driven rewards to keep children scrolling despite known risks. That foundation, a deep-rooted respect for the trenches of storytelling, is exactly what is currently disrupting the often-sterile and overly corporate world of public relations. Along with her partner-in-strategy, Kelly McCabe, Harito is proving that in 2026, the most valuable currency isn't just reach, it's keeping a finger on the pulse. Parents of children who have died due to social media harms hold a vigil for their kids on Thursday, Feb. 5, 2026 at the L.A. Superior Courthouse. As lawyer Mark Lanier flashed a cartoon road sign reading “Science of Addiction” on a large screen inside a Los Angeles courtroom Tuesday, Dr. Anna Lembke walked jurors through what she described as the four “C's” of addiction: loss of control, cravings, compulsions, and consequences. Called as the first witness in a closely watched trial over claims Meta and YouTube negligently designed platforms that were addictive to children, Lembke, the medical director of Stanford University's addiction medicine program and the author of the best-selling book Dopamine Nation, said young users' brains are “especially vulnerable” to problems associated with those four traits. The reason, she told jurors, is that adolescents' prefrontal cortices are not yet fully integrated with deeper midbrain systems that regulate behavior. Seattle Seahawks' quarterback #14 Sam Darnold and Seattle Seahawks' head coach Mike Macdonald celebrate with the Vince Lombardi Trophy after the Seattle Seahawks defeated the New England Patriots during Super Bowl LX at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California on February 8, 2026. The Seattle Seahawks have won Super Bowl LX, defeating the New England Patriots 29-13 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, on Sunday. The Latin superstar just made history with his Grammy win for Album of the Year and will keep his historic streak going when he delivers the first Super Bowl halftime headlining show in Spanish on Sunday. Bad Bunny has already promised “the world will dance” in a preview trailer, so it's bound to be one hell of a blowout bash as the star celebrates his beloved Puerto Rico on the national stage. During his “No Me Quiero Ir De Aqui” residency in P.R. last year, the star invited a star-studded Rolodex of past collaborators and famous friends each night. It only makes sense he would bring some of those same folks, and even bigger stars, out for his big moment at the Super Bowl. We're not sure what he's going to do yet: Given his ICE speeches at the Grammys, it's likely he could get political. He could also dedicate the entire performance to Puerto Rico.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last week, former US President Barack Obama jumped onto a podcast with Brian Tyler Cohen in which they discussed a wide array of topics. One clip in particular from the podcast went “out of this world” viral after host Brian Tyler Cohen asked former president Obama “are aliens real?”. A post shared by Barack Obama (@barackobama) With many interpreting his answer that he had seen legitimate proof of alien life off earth. Which, understandably had many people losing their minds and freaking out. The clip has gone so viral that the former president has even had to release a clarifying comment to calm people down. “I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it's gotten attention let me clarify. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we've been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Obama believes has not seen any solid evidence of aliens or little green men in Area 51, but confidently feels that the universe is so grand that it is all but a certainty life off earth exists. Do you think the aliens made him say these comments after they got mad at him for exposing them. Australia's most popular car is facing an urgent recall over a potentially fatal safety defect.</p>
