                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Your digital bookshelf on a device like the Kindle Colorsoft becomes almost as colorful as the ones you have at home, and browsing through a sea of new titles on the shop side becomes much more engaging than a sea of black-and-white. It's a great purchase if you read any books that might have illustrations on the pages, or if you like color highlights. Amazon finally came out with color Kindles starting last year, but with the close-to-$300 price tag, we weren't as impressed as we should have been. But right now, during Black Friday, you can get the colorful Kindle Colorsoft for almost as cheap as the black-and-white Kindle Paperwhite. While there are a ton of Kindle deals you can shop right now, this is easily the biggest one not to miss. The Signature Edition has an auto-adjusting warm light, while the basic Colorsoft has a warm light you can manually adjust. You'll get twice as much storage on the Signature, too, with 32 GB over 16 GB, and the Signature can be wirelessly charged. Other than those three features, though, both have the same 7-inch screen and resolution of 300 pixels-per-inch (or ppi) for black-and-white content and 150 ppi for color. My only complaint is that the Dark Mode no longer turns menu pages dark, and doesn't work on downloaded content like AZW3 documents (which are a special ebook style formatted specifically for Kindles). Overall, it's a great e-reader, just pricey, especially since you aren't getting things like page-turner buttons or the ability to double as a digital notebook like you can with Kobo's colorful e-readers. If you're a Kindle enthusiast, though, this is truly the best time to buy. Get best-in-class reporting and exclusive subscriber content that's too important to ignore.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The report says the company intends to invest 1.5 trillion yen — US$9.6 billion — in a new plant on its existing site, with construction scheduled to begin in May next year. SK hynix currently leads the market and has committed most of its HBM, DRAM and NAND output to Nvidia through 2026. Samsung is working to catch up with its 12-layer HBM3E stacks, while Micron has pushed hard to grow its own presence through HBM3E supply deals with Nvidia and AMD. TrendForce data shows Micron moving toward roughly a quarter of the HBM market with 20% of shipments as production increases; a dedicated Hiroshima expansion could shift that balance further once it comes online. Japan has been aggressive in courting this kind of investment, offering substantial government incentives to foreign chipmakers as part of a wider effort to rebuild domestic semiconductor capacity. TSMC's Kumamoto fabs and the state-backed Rapidus project are already part of this strategy. Last year, Micron announced plans to introduce EUV-based DRAM production on the same Hiroshima campus, investing 500 billion yen of its own cash and supported by nearly 200 billion yen in subsidies. Capacity has been thin throughout the current GPU cycle, with long lead times and allocation limits driven by the mismatch between demand and available wafer starts. If Micron's new plant reaches volume production in 2028, it will arrive just as those next-generation GPUs are. For Micron, Hiroshima offers political and financial stability at a moment when both geopolitics and the market cause increasing uncertainty, and Tokyo's willingness to fund a third of the project removes some of the risk from a multiyear build.

Microsoft has admitted that the non-security preview update KB5064081 has an issue that will make it a bit harder to log into your computer using your password. This isn't a critical security or performance issue, especially as it only impacts the Windows user interface. It's nonetheless annoying to those users, especially if you forgot your PIN for Windows Hello and you now can't quite figure out how to type in your password. In fact, Microsoft released an emergency patch last month after an update prevented users from using the keyboard and mouse when in the Windows Recovery Environment. Even other companies need to deal with Windows Updates shenanigans. For example, Nvidia released an emergency driver update in the latter part of November after a Windows 11 24H2 and 25H2 update significantly reduced performance in some games. This hotfix resulted in 50% performance increase for affected titles, giving many frustrated gamers a reason to rejoice. Thankfully, Microsoft has several Windows Insider channels where most bugs are caught before they're rolled out to the average user. These should catch most of the biggest bugs that Microsoft's engineering and programming teams might have missed, but even then, a few issues sometimes slip through the cracks and get a wider release.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you haven't started decorating yet because you need more holiday decor, good news: we found the best Black Friday Christmas tree deals and smart light sales. Whether you need a whole new tree covered in artificial snow, or smart lights you can have automatically turn on (because an automated holiday is a happy one, trust me!) these sales have you covered from all of the best holiday gear we've tried. That includes permanent outdoor lights from the likes of Eufy and Lepro, smart string lights from Twinkly, and best of all a range of on-sale artificial Christmas trees we tested with interior designers from brands like Basalm Hill, King of Christmas, and more. Our favorite overall artificial Christmas tree was the easy favorite of the interior designers who helped us test and review them. One assembler called it “the Hermès of Christmas trees” and it had both a beautiful look to the evergreen branches and bright built-in LED lights. The branches are easy to hang ornaments on thanks to the slight upward slope, and a mix of needle types give it a great texture. It's a great investment tree that's on sale. Flocked trees are covered in artificial snow to give it that extra Christmas-y look, and our favorite flocked design is this tree from King of Christmas. Out of the trees we tested, this tree really nailed the fresh snow look, which is hard to do artificially. Out of all the trees we tested, not only is this the cheapest one we liked, but it was rated easiest artificial Christmas tree to fluff thanks to its pliable branches. The easy fluff makes it look much fuller and more natural than trees that aren't easy to do that with, and makes this cheaper tree look high end. After sitting in storage for a year, these lights easily reconnected to my app and Wi-Fi with no problem, and it was easy to take a quick photo with the app to re-map the lights with my current setup. I love the range of designs you can find or create in the Twinkly app, and it was easy to set a timer so that they'll turn on and off at the right time. These are my all-around best pick for smart Christmas lights. Like the Strings above, there's plenty of designs you can choose from or create in the app, and easy controls all around. We've been testing tons of outdoor permanent lights this holiday season, and this set from Eufy is one of the standouts. WIRED reviewer Kat Merck found the app easy to navigate for choosing colors and schedules for her lights, and loved the wide offering of holiday presets to take advantage of. There's an AI feature to make customized light shows, and the Eufy S4 lights work with the Matter protocol, so it can sync with Apple, Google, and Alexa's smart home ecosystems. If the sales aren't getting the permanent outdoor lights cheap enough for you, then you'll be thrilled to see our budget set is on sale for a similar price you'd get regular smart lights for. WIRED reviewer Martin Cizmar is happy with these lights on his home, but he does warn that there's annoying in-app AI you have to get around to get access to regular controls. Once you click past it, these lights are easy to control and customize like you would any set of smart lights.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team. We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. Amazon keeps the deals coming all weekend long, from Black Friday to Cyber Monday and it turns the shopping event into a marathon of discounts in every category. Amazon has two different packages: The standard package is available to everyone for $239 instead of $299 and the Combo version is only available to Prime members for $309 instead of $389. If you plan to fly more than just on weekends, this is the better option. This weight limit made engineers make smart decisions that let them put real 4K UHD recording capability into a drone that you can fold up and put in your jacket pocket. This means that wind gusts and sudden changes in direction won't make the footage shaky and unusable, which happens with cheaper drones that have electronic stabilization. When you watch your footage, you'll see this mechanical advantage: smooth cinematic pans and tracking shots look professional instead of like someone running with a handheld camera. The 1/2.6-inch CMOS sensor records 4K video at 30 frames per second with enough detail that you can crop and reframe it in post-production without losing quality. This resolution is important if you want to share content on modern screens or keep your options open for editing. The camera can also take 12-megapixel stills in JPEG or RAW format which lets photographers control exposure and color grading that automated JPEG processing takes away. Under perfect conditions, OcuSync 4 transmission technology can keep a stable video feed up to 10 kilometers away with little interference. You can fly beyond your line of sight for dramatic establishing shots or follow subjects over large areas without worrying about losing connection because of this longer range. The Combo package comes with two batteries so you can switch out a dead one and keep flying without having to wait hours for it to charge. This feature has saved a lot of drones from crashing into trees or getting lost in forests when pilots lose their way or run into problems they weren't expecting. The wind resistance can handle gusts of up to 10.7 meters per second (about 24 mph) so you can use the Mini 4K outside in normal weather instead of only on perfectly calm days, which don't happen very often in real life. The standard package, which costs $239 instead of $299, is a good deal for people who only fly once in a while and don't mind shorter sessions. For just $70 more, Prime members get the second battery, extra props, and carrying case.</p>
