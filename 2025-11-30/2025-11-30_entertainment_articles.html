                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oscar winner Da'Vine Joy Randolph is many credits removed from her once-nascent career — which began with breakout roles in Dolemite Is My Name and continued with Hulu‘s Only Murders in the Building — but there's one early project she keeps revisiting alongside co-star Zoë Kravitz: High Fidelity. When asked if she would ever want the series to return after its abrupt cancellation, Randolph told Rolling Stone: “Absolutely. Zoë and I talk about it all the time, like, ‘How can we figure this out?' 2025 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast & Streaming 'Scrubs' Teaser: Zach Braff, Donald Faison & The Gang Are Back In First Footage Of Reboot Sometimes you have to just let things be what it is organically and trust in the process to find the next thing.” The 2020 series offered a modernized, gender-swapped take on the John Cusack romantic comedy classic (starring Kravitz's mother, actress Lisa Bonet, and itself based on Nick Hornby's 1995 novel); it centers on Robyn “Rob” Brooks (Kravitz), a young music-obsessed record store owner in Brooklyn, as she reflects on the ups and downs of her previous failed relationships. Randolph starred as Cherise, an employee at Championship Vinyl and one of Rob's closest friends. Though critic and audience reviews were overwhelmingly positive, the series was canceled on Hulu after one season. To make matters worse, the finale ended on a cliffhanger of sorts, with Rob choosing to be Jake Lacy's Clyde after being torn between him and Mac (Kingsley Ben-Adir). Kravitz has often discussed her disappointment with the conclusion of the series, telling Elle earlier this year, “That's where I really learned about producing and editing and writing, and man, I'm sad.

Curated and selected by IndieWire's editorial team, IndieWire Honors is a celebration of the filmmakers, artisans, and performers behind films well worth toasting. In the days leading up to the Los Angeles event, IndieWire is showcasing their work with new interviews and tributes from their peers. The great Nina Hoss doesn't need to work herself up into crying onstage or onscreen if the moment is right and she's really feeling it. Earlier this year, in spring 2025, the Berlin Silver Bear-winning actress (2007's “Yella”) starred onstage at St. Ann's Warehouse in Dumbo, New York City, as melancholy matriarch Lyubov Ranevskaya in Benedict Andrews' “The Cherry Orchard,” an adaptation of the Anton Chekhov classic. Seated two rows from the theater-in-the-round-style stage at St. Ann's, I observed Hoss actually weeping during a key emotional scene. Related Stories ‘Hamnet' Changes the Maggie O'Farrell Novel's Approach to Time Ryan Coogler on ‘Sinners' DP Autumn Durald Arkapaw's Passionate Approach to Cinematography In her latest exquisite performance in a long career of them already, as Eileen Lovborg in writer/director Nia DaCosta's gender-swapped Henrik Ibsen adaptation “Hedda,” Hoss also lathers herself up into gamut-spanning stages of emotional distress. Whether wasted out of her mind after Hedda Gabler (Tessa Thompson) coaxes Hoss' imperious literature professor off the wagon, or a sobbing, heaving wreck of herself when the pages of her latest book go missing at a 1950s mansion party. It's another extraordinary, unmannered, and deeply felt performance from one of Europe's best working actors. “It's slightly weird to talk about that because, in a way, I don't even think of [how to make myself cry]. When I put myself in this situation, in this moment, that's just what happens,” said Hoss, who will receive this year's Spotlight Award at the 2026 winter IndieWire Honors ceremony on Thursday, December 4. “I don't have another part of my brain going on to push me into creating tears, like a technique. Hoss, who starred as Cate Blanchett's watchful partner in “TÁR” and on TV's “Homeland” for three seasons, is best known for her alchemical collaborations with director Christian Petzold across six films: There was “Yella,” but also “Barbara,” “Phoenix,” and more, though Hoss has not worked with the director since 2014's devastating post-World War II drama “Phoenix,” where she played a Hitchcockian Auschwitz survivor whose husband does not recognize her after facial reconstructive surgery. And the story of how Petzold discovered Hoss for his 2001 film “Something to Remind Me” is Hitchcockian in itself, much the way Hitch discovered Tippi Hedren in a TV commercial for diet soda. This was after Hoss broke out in the 1996 period drama “A Girl Called Rosemary.” Eight million people saw it, and that was the part of a prostitute, a woman who really existed,” Hoss said. “It was a criminal story, and I looked a bit like Marilyn Monroe, so you could think, ‘Oh, my God, she's the new sex-bomb blonde thing.' Obviously, I said things that didn't sound too dumb, and that's why Christian Petzold saw one of these talk shows and said, ‘Oh, she's completely different from what I thought she would be.' It was like, ‘The pin-up girl for intellectuals. Hoss had previously spent six years onstage in a German repertory theater production of “Hedda Gabler” in various roles, including as Hedda herself. “We have this repertoire system, which means I'm part of the ensemble, which I was for like 25 years,” Hoss said. Sometimes, I had six plays running at the same time. That's how the repertoire system is in Germany. Hoss shot “Hedda” in early 2024 in the United Kingdom, where she said playing Ibsen's Ejlert part as the female Eileen was “easy for me, in a way, because just by the fact that she's a woman, it made it so much more dangerous for Hedda, and I think that's what I was always looking for. While playing Hedda, I thought it would be so interesting — and I was never quite sure — it comes with the play that Ibsen wrote that these two men that Hedda is framed with [including her husband George] are not really on her level. Here with Eileen, there is someone on her level, and they meet eye to eye, and all of a sudden, Hedda is in danger because there is someone who really knows her, and knows how manipulative she is, and finds that exciting but is also aware of what she's capable of doing.” Hoss ultimately had to confront her feelings about Ejlert circa her days on the stage by stepping into his very shoes for this gorgeously sinuous film: “That came somehow with just being a woman at the time because it's still [Ibsen's] text. Because of the patriarchal structure Eileen is under, that makes it so much more of an existential struggle for her than it is for Ejlert. That was just phenomenal to explore and work on.” Something I always like to ask actors who play characters in various states of inebriation: What's the secret to playing a good, old-fashioned sloppy drunk? By the end of “Hedda,” Eileen is properly sauced despite showing up to her former protégé's party newly sober. At a certain point, I also thought there are some moments, like when you go into water, that sober you. These were the things I had to be very precise with, and then you just have to rein it in. Hoss' character in “Tár” — Lydia's (Blanchett) partner but also the first violinist of the Berlin symphony — is more emotionally restricted and always watching. In “Hedda,” Hoss gets to unleash emotionally, though onscreen breakdowns never take a piece out of her the way they might other actors. “I'm good at switching off because, at the end of the day, I experience it in this moment. But, Hoss said, it depends what you're working on. “If it's continuously dark, like when I did ‘Medea,' that puts you into a slightly depressive mode. To motivate what she's doing, and what she's going through, to put her in that moment, is so dark and heavy that it's hard [not to] get into a bad mood about the world and life, everything, relationships. It does trickle into your life, the material you work on. But when we talk about Eileen, I go full in, and then I have to go out to regain some energy again. The most potent moment in “Hedda,” for Hoss and the audience, is the scene in which Eileen arrives at Hedda's party, with Thompson affixed, Spike Lee-style, on a floating dolly as she's drawn amorously toward her former lover. Eileen stands there, domineeringly, in a position of power and seduction. Tessa had always just walked up to me, which I found quite strong, also. So I thought, OK, that's what we're doing. Nia didn't talk to me about that,” Hoss said. “When I came down to the room and saw Tessa being strapped on this dolly, I said, ‘What are we doing? But then it just made so much sense, and I felt very appreciative that, in a way, my character and therefore also me, the actress inhabiting this character, gets this huge present of an entrance like that. I can't act that as the others have to do. This moment is there, where time stands still.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Comedian Sebastian Maniscalco may not (yet) have a Saturday Night Live hosting stint under his belt, but he does have something arguably just as coveted — a bona fide impression. The comic, who is known for his physical comedy style and exaggerated speech, reacted to Marcello Hernandez‘s recent parody of him, calling the eponymous sketch flattering. In a preview clip of his upcoming appearance on The Drew Barrymore Show Dec. 2, Maniscalco said, “He did a great job. He actually called me on Thursday before the show, said, ‘Do you want to come in and do a cameo at the end of it?' What to Expect in 'Saturday Night Live' Season 51: News And Updates “I'm here today to kind of petition — and maybe you could help me,” he said. Maniscalco gave similar comments to Complex in an interview tied to the release of his latest Hulu special, It Ain't Right. I thought the gray hair was a little excessive,” he said. If we could just have people keep imitating me, I think it'll be fine,” joking that “the problem is if I'm in it.” In the viral SNL sketch, which debuted Nov. 15, host Glen Powell's bachelor party is thrown into disarray when he invites an old pal to join the rest of the boys, warning his friends that the acquaintance is none other than world-famous standup Maniscalco. “You gotta be kidding me,” Maniscalco commented on his initial repost of the skit shortly after its release. SNL is currently on its holiday hiatus, returning for a three-week run in December beginning this Saturday. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2025 Hallmark Christmas Experience in Kansas City is off to a rip-roaring start, with fans from across the country descending on Hallmark's national headquarters for the first of four weekends featuring events with Hallmark Channel stars, creative classes, a holiday market and more. Britt, Kimberley Sustad, Tyler Hynes, Rhiannon Fish, Robert Buckley, and Jessy Schram. “Finding Mr. Christmas” host Jonathan Bennett also flew in to host several onstage events, including a Hallmark version of “The Dating Game” on November 29. Hallmark disguised the stars' voices to help keep them anonymous, and that turned into a hysterical part of their participation. Next, when “A Christmas Angel Match” star Ayres tried out his microphone, he hilariously (and correctly) assessed that he sounded like a “serial killer.” Finally, Hynes gave his mic a try and had everyone laughing by only answering in Spanish. During the first round, the fan asked Contestant #2, which was Ayres, what animal he'd choose as his sidekick if he were a superhero. With the voice distortion on the mic, Ayres' laugh sounded like a quintessential cartoon nemesis, and threw back his head with a guttural, mischievous laugh. As he leaned into it, the guys joined in. We're pretty sure no one had on their Hallmark Christmas Experience bingo card that Walker and Britt would be the ones to bring so much spice to the Dating Game! First, Walker had to be jokingly hauled off the stage multiple times by Hynes and Campbell, his “Three Wise Men” trilogy co-stars, for his suggestive comments and singing. During his round of the Hallmark Dating Game alongside Britt and Buckley, Walker had the same deep-voiced, sinister-sounding microphone that Ayres had used previously. And for whatever reason, it put him in the mood to repeatedly and inexplicably sing Exile's 1978 song “Kiss You All Over,” slowly crooning the lyrics, “I want to kiss you all over, till the night closes in.” Walker also grabbed Britt's high-pitched mic at one point to sing the song. It sounded just as creepy, prompting Campbell and Hynes to run out onstage to remove him, which sent the crowd into fits of laughter. But Walker's most egregious offense, which also got him yanked offstage by Hynes and Campbell, was his answer about what baked good he's most like. Take it off!” But that's exactly what happened when Britt answered what his superhero costume would look like and whether it would have any “special features.” When Britt stood up and pretended he was going to take off his clothes, the crowd gasped, squealed, and then started shouting, “Take it off! When Britt sat back down, he declared, “I'm more of a skin guy,” drawing surprised laughs from the crowd. When he raised his eyebrows and flashed his big grin, he simply asked, “Special features?” Worried the innuendo would be too spicy for Hallmark, Campbell and Hynes ran onto the stage to whisk him away. Hallmark leading ladies Taylor Cole, Rhiannon Fish, and Jessy Schram had their own funny segment, taking questions from a male fan on the other side of the partition. Cole pretended to be a whiny mean girl and declared she wasn't ever interested in dating the guy after he selected Schram as his “date.” After another full day of fun on November 30, the Hallmark Christmas Experience has three weekends left in Kansas City, with a different cast of stars attending each.

Call it childish, silly, annoying… We grow up to become women but do you dare keep the most sensitive part of the soul and allow it to rebel… the child within must speak in the most vulnerable of times,” Spears, 43, penned.

Spears' latest dancing video comes nearly two weeks after she was spotted leaving a wine bar with a champagne flute in hand, then getting into her car and speeding off. The Grammy winner also said she “can't go anywhere” without being harassed. In September, Page Six exclusively reported that Spears had been refusing help from people as fears about her mental health and living conditions continued to grow. “She has people like staff, security guards, assistants, no real friends,” an insider told us. One source told us that though Spears “has moments of clarity and moments where it feels like a roller coaster,” she is “still the sweetest, kindest person.” The question is, ‘How do we help her? The “Oops!…I Did It Again” singer's friends are also reportedly worried that Spears is residing in a “messy mansion” covered in dog poop. She doesn't clean up after the dogs, she doesn't have someone there cleaning every day, and she just isn't functioning like an adult would function,” a source told the Daily Mail. In November 2021, Spears famously broke free of her 13-year legal conservatorship.</p>

Cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw may be behind some of the year's most striking imagery, but the innovator who combined 65mm IMAX and Super Panavision 70 to create the gorgeous, ambitious large-format photography of “Sinners” never envisioned a career in filmmaking. But even though she went to college with no plans to enter the film industry, the seeds had been planted years before. In the back of my mind, she played a big role in giving me a love for movies and going to the theater.” She wrote a paper on two black-and-white masterpieces: “Raging Bull,” which Michael Chapman shot for Martin Scorsese, and “Broadway Danny Rose,” one of many landmark collaborations between Gordon Willis and Woody Allen. “I wanted to know who was making these images.” When Arkapaw started researching cinematographers, she was disappointed by the dearth of women in the profession. But she found a few role models, like Ellen Kuras, who shot 2001's “Blow,” and that was enough to inspire her to dive headfirst into studying and immersing herself in the world of cinematography. After graduating from LMU and spending a few years working in the corporate world, she decided to commit once and for all to pursuing a career in cinematography. Even though it meant trading steady employment for student loans and an uncertain future, when she was accepted into the AFI Conservatory's cinematography program, Arkapaw left the idea of a life working at a desk behind. At AFI, Arkapaw got the opportunity to shoot her first feature film when classmate Rafael Palacio Illingworth wrote, directed, and starred in “Macho,” a microbudget dramedy that Arkapaw photographed between her first and second years. “We shot on 35mm and it won an award at Raindance,” Arkapaw said, referring to the U.K. film festival. “That allowed me to become a DP before I graduated.” After graduation, Arkapaw shot another low-budget indie, “Guadalupe the Virgin,” and then she got the call that would lead to one of her most satisfying creative partnerships. “A classmate of mine at AFI was going to shoot [Gia Coppola's] ‘Palo Alto,' and he was unavailable one day and asked me if I could fill in,” Arkapaw said. “Gia was shooting some stuff on a 7D to show [James] Franco — little vignettes with her friends.” When Arkapaw came on board to photograph the feature, in some ways it felt like starting from scratch — even with two features and several shorts already under her belt. Another filmmaker Arkapaw quickly found a common language with was “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” and “Sinners” director Ryan Coogler, whom she had initially hoped to work with on the 2015 “Rocky” spinoff, “Creed.” “I'm really good friends with [cinematographer] Bradford Young, and it was Bradford who told Ryan about me when he was looking for a DP for ‘Creed,'” Arkapaw said. “When he brought my name up to the studio, I only had ‘Palo Alto' as a credit, and it wasn't enough for the studio to move forward with me. Unfortunately, we were like ships passing in the night.” Luckily, by the time Coogler needed a director of photography to come on board 2022's “Wakanda Forever,” Arkapaw had amassed several substantial credits, including work on the Marvel TV series “Loki.” The success of that series put Arkapaw at the top of not only Coogler's list but also the studio's, and after her first Zoom call with Coogler, she knew she had met another filmmaking soulmate. “It felt like we were long lost cousins,” Arkapaw said. “It just felt right, like I was meant to meet him and meant to be a part of that group.” Coogler had already assembled most of his team from people he'd worked with on previous movies, with Arkapaw and the assistant director being the only two new additions. “It's a daunting thing to come in on the second movie when the first one had such a tight-knit family, but I felt really supported,” she said. Because “Wakanda Forever” had such a long shoot — around an entire year — Coogler said at the time that Arkapaw was the DP he had worked the most with, even though they had only made one movie together. That project turned out to be “Sinners,” a film that would utilize Arkapaw's greatest strengths: her impeccable eye, along with her talent for marrying images to music, as seen in her music videos for SZA, Rihanna, the Jonas Brothers, and more. She immediately began talking with Coogler about influences ranging from Paul Thomas Anderson's “There Will Be Blood” to John Carpenter's “The Thing,” but her primary inspiration came from a book of photographs by Eudora Welty. “It was a book of black-and-white photos Ryan told me about from the 1930s. “It opened his mind up, and he called me immediately,” Arkapaw said. Coogler floated the extremely wide Ultra Panavision 70 process that Quentin Tarantino used for “The Hateful Eight” — and which had been used on spectacles like “Ben-Hur” and “The Greatest Story Ever Told.” So she began looking at 65mm dailies from a variety of processes and films, running scenes from Tarantino's 2015 Western, “2001: A Space Odyssey,” “Tenet,” and others at FotoKem. This made Arkapaw, who once struggled to find female role models, the first woman to shoot on both IMAX film and in Ultra Panavision. (She's also the only cinematographer to shoot with IMAX Ektachrome film stock, which was created by Kodak especially for “Sinners.”) But Arkapaw was convinced that it was the right decision, which was confirmed when she and Coogler shot more test footage and cut it together to see how the alternating, disparate aspect ratios would work. The approach enabled Arkapaw to achieve a combination of period accuracy and visceral immediacy that was further enhanced by her careful selection of anamorphic lenses. Many of these were engineered specifically for “Sinners” by Panavision lens genius Dan Sasaki, though Arkapaw also “grabbed some other lenses, like the lenses from ‘2001: A Space Odyssey. “When you're working with this format that's very resolute, they pair nicely, as far as having age and texture to the image, because you want it to look like the 1930s.” Given the audacious blend of genres and complex thematic layering, the critical and commercial success of “Sinners” was hardly a given, but Arkapaw did have a sense she was working on something unique during production. There were so many moments on set early on where I would look at Ryan, and it would be unspoken: ‘Wow, this is really special. The kind of inspiration she felt while working on “Sinners” is what Arkapaw always aspires to — and what makes her more and more excited about her work as a cinematographer. “All you want as a photographer is to be inspired every time you look through the lens,” she said, “and it was happening constantly on this film for me.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yamada, who first debuted as the notorious villain in September 2023, has been keeping fans updated on her recent adventures, and needless to say, she's having a blast. And it turns out the one who finally brought about Luna's downfall was none other than one of her former victims, art teacher Ms. Dylan. Shortly after her character was killed off, Yamada took to Instagram to reflect on her time on the show. “So many tears shed, blood spilled, friendships formed, and memories made on @boldandbeautifulcbs,” Yamada captioned the post she shared on November 21. Yamada isn't wasting time sulking over Luna's death. In another Instagram post, Yamada shared a glimpse of her fun moments since leaving the show. “Lucky me,” Yamada captioned a carousel of photos from her recent outing. In other photos, Yamada could be seen smoking a cigarette and lounging on a car hood. She even posed with her real-life bestie and “The Bold and the Beautiful” co-star Christian Weissmann. The Daytime Emmy-winning actress also appeared to have crossed paths with Kris Jenner, sharing a photo of the momager on Instagram. One fan wrote, “Will you ever come back as Luna? Another commented, “Please bring Luna back from the dead!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"I think that's a hard line for me now," the Paramore frontwoman said. Hayley Williams is drawing a firm boundary ahead of her 2026 solo tour. The Paramore frontwoman, who recently announced an expanded run of dates due to high demand, said she intends her shows to be explicitly inclusive spaces — and made clear that anyone who holds discriminatory views should not expect to feel comfortable attending. In a new interview with Clash, Williams said she wants the tour to be a place where every fan can “feel welcome to the party,” but added that this commitment also requires her to take a public stance about who she does not want in the room. Vanessa Hudgens Gives Birth to Second Baby: 'What a Wild Ride Labor Is' Her upcoming tour — which supports her latest solo album, Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party — The North American leg kicks off on March 28 in Atlanta and willl include stops in Toronto, Boston, Philadelphia, New York, Chicago, Nashville, Austin, Oakland, Los Angeles, and more, before she hits the UK and Europe in June next year. Last year, after declining an official state honor, she criticised the actions of the state's Republican leadership, calling out what she described as “blatant racism” and encouraging young people to vote with equality in mind. In 2022, she said she avoided playing guitar on stage because of the likelihood of derisive comments, and in 2023 she addressed online backlash after postponing Paramore shows due to illness, calling out “internet bros” and clarifying that most rock bands would not co-sign that behaviour.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Torrential Flood of Ugly Losers.” “Thwarting Forever Ubiquitous Lameness.” “Tit Fuck Uranus Lengthwise.” “Turds, Farts, and Uber-Logs.” “Tour Flunkies Under Live.” Eickelberg was proposing variations on the initials of her own unwieldy band name: Thinking Fellers Union Local 282, the kind of name that arrives as a lark and settles in as an albatross. Seven months before, they had released Strangers From the Universe, an album that opens with a punk-surrealist ode to an enviable tortoise and closes with a folk-surrealist ballad about the end of humanity as we know it. More interest in structure and sweetness than you might think at first, when all you notice are the smash cuts from one strange musical scene to the next. Five singers, three guitars, bass, drums, banjo, mandolin, Optigan, taking turns or all going at once. This was Thinking Fellers Union Local 282's idea of a commercial record. They were getting ready to hit the road and open for—to be Tour Flunkies Under—Live. “It answered a lot of questions for us, too,” she later said in an interview with Perfect Sound Forever, “because it made it so clear that there was just no fucking way that we ever gonna get bigger than we were.” Thinking Fellers Union Local 282, in this musically astounding and commercially disappointing stretch of mid-to-late life, was Eickelberg on bass; Mark Davies, Brian Hageman, and Hugh Swarts on guitars; and Jay Paget on drums. Everyone sang, contributed to songwriting, and played instruments other than their primary one. (An earlier album's liner notes simply credit all five with “instruments.”) The four string-playing Fellers had grown up in Iowa and moved to the Bay Area in the mid-'80s, where they soon linked up with original drummer Paul Bergmann and commenced living the dream of bohemian band life, with all five members shacking up together and practicing in the same Oakland house. A detailed timeline of the band's existence on their official website gives a window on their habits around this period: “drinking generic burgundy, listening to two big band radio stations at the same time, and writing songs.” Rent was cheap and the music industry's brief but intense fascination with “alternative rock” made an actual career for a band as strange as this one seem worth pursuing. They'd even opened for Nirvana once, a month after Nevermind came out. It's hard to imagine their particular sensibility—driven by mind-meld improvisation and arcane inside jokes, so intensely collaborative as to render individual authorship nearly moot—emerging without this period of cohabitation and the economic conditions that enabled it. They must have spent so much time practicing, bouncing ideas, fucking around, hanging out. By the time of Strangers From the Universe, they were four albums and three EPs deep and seriously considering quitting. The last two full-lengths had come out on Matador, a label whose combination of curatorial boldness and distribution muscle made it perhaps the ideal home for them, but their signing hadn't translated to big sales or reliable crowds. “The dread that we won't get our guarantee, that we'll be hog-tied or kicked out,” Eickelberg wrote at one particularly empty and dispiriting show in Buffalo. After touring relentlessly for several years, they took a yearlong hiatus in 1993. The situation was dire, but something about it inspired them to keep going, to take a big swing and see if they could make a real living in music after all. “We did sporadic things during that time, but we were kind of trying to take a break from each other,” Davies said of Strangers From the Universe's gestation. “And then at the end of that period we basically said, ‘Let's try to push it more instead of giving up. It's true that the quotient of songs to noise experiments was a bit higher than on previous albums, but the songs themselves are more open-ended, further abstracting the influence of post-punk and no wave into a dream zone where anything at all might happen. And though the mix was cleaner than it had ever been, it only served to reveal Thinking Fellers' inexorable weirdness in sparkling new detail. “February,” with its intricately gnarled figurations of banjo and furious electric guitar, might serve as the basis of an entire subgenre if anyone else could be bothered to pick up the baton, progressive punk for the acid hoedown scene. Paget plays drums like the caffeinated offspring of Can's Jaki Liebezeit, finding deep pockets in a groove that might otherwise sound like so much clattering. With “Guillotine,” a tapestry of chiming strings and stoned group chanting, they were nearly to the point of inventing Animal Collective, a band of Feller fanatics so devoted they once convinced their heroes to reunite for a few shows. The song's crisscrossing arpeggios start out pleasantly dreamy but slide here and there into foreboding dissonance. The whole thing feels like it might float away if not for a knotty descending riff that shows up every once in a while to keep things tethered to the ground. At some point, so gradually that you hardly notice it happening, the dissonance takes over. Without ever losing its sense of hazy reverie, the song becomes genuinely frightening, a good high gone bad. Fans affectionately call these pieces “Feller filler.” “Bomber Pilot WWII,” the third track on Strangers, is a typical example: some lonesome guitar ambience accompanied by crunchy low-end sounds of uncertain origin, all drifting nowhere in particular for about a minute before cutting out. Feller filler occupies a complicated place in the Thinking Fellers canon. On one hand, you could skip it all without missing much. On the other, its persistence across their catalog, even on an ostensibly listener-friendly album like this one, suggests it was a crucial element of the band's self-conception about which they were not willing to compromise. They wrote many of their songs through collective improvisation, and they often jammed onstage; Feller filler both lays bare the inner workings of their process and serves as a gauntlet for any would-be fans who can't hang. They were practically begging Live's crowd to throw basketballs. Thinking Fellers' surreal humor and penchant for undercutting their own ambition can obscure the fact that they were top-notch musicians. They would expend enormous energy on what might seem like jokes, like a note-perfect three-guitar arrangement of the orchestral theme song to a 1950s variety show, performed live on the Strangers From the Universe tour. The individual members had little if any formal training on their instruments; you get the sense that they learned to play by playing together, honing their group sensibility over what must have been countless hours of rehearsal. Like their shaggy San Francisco forebears in the Grateful Dead, by living together and playing constantly, they all found instrumental voices that were perfect for this particular band, even if they weren't necessarily the kind of professional-grade virtuosos who would thrive in any context they encountered. Rarely is anyone playing lead in a traditional sense—there's simply too much going on—but if you focus on any particular instrumental part, you'll often find a marvel of intricacy. Their songwriting is less a matter of chords and a melody than the architectural arrangement of these gleaming and misshapen riffs, laid at seemingly impossible angles of mutual support, like pillars in an Escher drawing. It feels a bit like one of those Paul McCartney medley-songs that involve stitching together the best parts of six different abandoned compositions, one refrain after another. For Thinking Fellers, the equivalent of “If I ever get out of here…” is someone moaning through distortion so thick you can only make out half the words over rainfall sound effects and a keyboard coming in from the next room. You can almost imagine the version of Thinking Fellers that did make it big, with legions of freaks pulling out their lighters and singing incoherently along. “My Pal the Tortoise,” the opener, might be cloyingly whimsical if its series of questions and answers about its shell-dwelling hero weren't so funny and oddly poetic. (“What does he file at the hall of records?/A proclamation of tortoise intent.”) But even in its more antic moments, the album is often preoccupied with endings and what comes after them. In keeping with the album's prevailing tone, death is experienced not as tragedy but transcendent release. When writing Strangers From the Universe, “We weren't thinking of going anywhere,” Hageman said. “We were thinking about ending.” Needless to say, the vision of giant clubs filled with adoring freaks didn't come to pass. Not everyone seems to have felt that way at the time. “This lifestyle and this pursuit seem more and more meaningless to me,” Eickelberg wrote in her tour diary in November '94, at the end of an entry about getting sick without health insurance. “I feel silly, being in a band and touring and hanging out in ugly, boring rock clubs (at my age.) When I look at us I think we are ridiculous sometimes.” “Half of the time on this tour I've thought—I've strongly believed—that we are fooling ourselves and shouldn't be in this business (at OUR ages),” she wrote soon after. Two months after the album came out, Thinking Fellers' final push at making an honest living in indie rock was beginning to sputter. The entire quixotic notion of alternative rock as a commercial prospect was sputtering, too. Within a year, Live's Throwing Copper would become the biggest rock album in America, helping to usher in the “post-grunge” era, when the majors stopped pretending to care about ingenuity and focused instead on signing increasingly faded carbon copies of Pearl Jam. Thinking Fellers toured for another year, parted with Matador, made another album, 1996's equally dazzling I Hope It Lands, and stepped back from the band as a career pursuit. They still played the occasional show and labored sporadically for years on their 2001 swan song, whose very title, Bob Dinners and Larry Noodles Present Tubby Turdner's Celebrity Avalanche, is enough to signal the retreat of whatever aspirations to rock stardom they once held. It's more elegiac than you might expect from the name: “91 Dodge Van,” titled after their old tour chariot, opens with autumnal guitars and Eickelberg sighing the lines “Looking back over our days, I know we've won/Sometimes it feels like that's erased by moving on.” It also has a song called “Boob Feeler.” “If the sadness of life makes you tired,” it begins, “and the failures of man make you sigh/You can look to the time soon arriving/When this noble experiment winds down and calls it a day.” “Noble Experiment,” a waltz-time lullaby for humanity's extinction, brings Strangers From the Universe's fixation on finality into clear focus, just as the album itself winds down. The Fellers receive this fate with characteristic jubilation: an opportunity to leave cruel routine behind and be reborn as sparrows chattering in the treetops or weeds busting up through old sidewalks. It would be disingenuous to suggest that Thinking Fellers Union Local 282 experienced a similarly transformative rebirth after calling it a day, that the band received the kind of widespread recognition in death that had eluded it in life.

“I'm not scared of Trump, because even though he says he's staying for ever, it's just not going to happen,” the Oscar nominee said in a recent interview. 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Josh Brolin says his character in Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery was not inspired by Donald Trump, whom he recalls as a former friend and “genius” in “marketing.”


	In a Saturday interview with The Independent, the Oscar nominee said his portrayal of Monsignor Wicks in the latest Knives Out film was not based on the president. “I could make something up and say it was rooted in a kind of Trumpian greed,” he noted, adding that after “Wicks garners a sense of power, then there are no boundaries.”




	The topic prompted Brolin to touch on his former friendship with the president, further addressing speculation of Trump running for a third term, which he predicted is “just not going to happen.”

	“I'm not scared of Trump, because even though he says he's staying for ever, it's just not going to happen. And if it does, then I'll deal with that moment,” Brolin said. “But having been a friend of Trump before he was president, I know a different guy.”


	The two met after Brolin starred in Wall Street 2: Money Never Sleeps, which the president was supposed to make a cameo in. Of Trump's business ventures, the actor argued that “there is no greater genius than him in marketing — he takes the weakness of the general population and fills it.” 


	“And that's why I think a lot of people feel that they have a mascot in him,” he added. “I think it's much less about Trump than it is about the general population and their need for validation.”

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The "Sneakernight" singer shared a selfie from her hospital bed. Vanessa Hudgens and husband Cole Tucker have welcomed their second child together. The High School Musical alum — and singer behind pop songs including 2008's “Sneakernight” and 2006's “Come Back to Me” — announced her newborn's birth on Saturday (Nov. 29) with a photo of herself hooked up to monitors in a hospital bed. In the snapshot, Hudgens appears to be holding hands with Tucker, a former professional baseball player who most recently played for the Los Angeles Angels before retiring in May. Kelly Clarkson Joins Spotify's Billions Club With 'Since U Been Gone' Diddy Helps Organize Prison Thanksgiving Meal for Inmates While Behind Bars The singer/actress publicly shared the news of her pregnancy in July, when she debuted her baby bump on social media through a maternity photo shoot with Tucker. Since then, she's shared other fun glimpses at life while expecting, including pictures of herself dressed up as Mother Earth — painting her belly as Earth — for Halloween, and vacation photos from attending a September wedding in Italy. The couple welcomed their first child together last year, in July 2024, and have since kept personal details private. No post-production news has been released; Deadline last reported the film was being presented and executive produced by Nick Cassavetes. Hudgens portrays romance novelist Abby Lynche, who “finds herself confined during 1969's Hurricane Camille, confronting personal revelations amid social upheaval and women's liberation while the storm rages outside.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Back in March, we reported that Amazon was embarking on a project that was going to be a bad idea that was going to make a lot of people mad, i.e., using artificial intelligence to generate dubbed voice tracks for anime series. Now, lo and behold, a whole bunch of people are exactly as mad as predicted, as the tech giant rolled out a new English dub of beloved anime series Banana Fish this month, completely generated by AI. Originally published in manga form starting in 1985, Banana Fish was both controversial and influential at the time for several aspects of its story of a noble gangster investigating a crime ring using the titular drug to control people's minds: Its violence, yes, but also its sexuality, whether that meant more explicit material happening in the criminal underworld, or the implied-so-hard-it's-one-shade-short-of-canon relationship between main character Ash Lynx and his friend Eiji Okumura. Although it released with English subtitles, the series never got an English voice track—until this week, when AI-generated Spanish and English versions of the show's dialogue were offered as “beta” features for Prime Video viewers. The response to the news has included a lot of very strongly negative reactions, for a lot of very strongly obvious reasons: Animation fans take their dubs and subs extremely serious regardless, and having voice actors be put out of work while a mega-giant foists off a product that can't hope to match the richness of a fully voiced set of performances is an extra twist of the digital knife. Per CBR, at least one voice actor who's worked on a number of big-name projects for Amazon in the past—Daman Mills, whose credits include Rebuild Of Evangelion, Dragon Ball Super, and One Piece—has stated on social media that he won't work for the company again if they keep the AI-generated dub up. (Meanwhile, we popped up the show's first episode for a minute just to make sure we weren't talking out of our asses on the quality of the resulting dub, and woof, is that some hideously lifeless robot talking. If the goal here was to completely drain a vibrant, fascinating show of all life in the most piss-the-fans-off-way possible, that's definitely one way to pull it off.)
