                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic is plenty familiar with lifting trophies. The Serbian superstar has earned 101 tour-level singles crowns during his illustrious career. But on Saturday at the Formula 1 Qatar Grand Prix Sprint Race, Djokovic was the one handing trophies to others. The 38-year-old presented hardware to winner Oscar Piastri, George Russell and Lando Norris. Djokovic has gotten to know plenty of F1 drivers over the years. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings had a nice chat with Russell two years ago in Monte-Carlo, spoke with the Briton last year at Wimbledon and enjoyed a conversation with Norris in Qatar one year ago. Piastri appreciated his moment with Djokovic Saturday, posting a photo of them on his Instagram Stories. Djokovic also crossed paths with members of legendary band Metallica, taking a photo with Lars Ulrich, James Hetfield and Robert Trujillo. Ulrich's father, Torben Ulrich, was a professional tennis player who in singles made the fourth round at three of the four majors.
