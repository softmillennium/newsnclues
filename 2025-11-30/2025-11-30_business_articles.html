                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Before your child even steps out the door every day, their emotional baseline for the day is already set — not by color-coded routines, but by how safe and connected they feel in your presence. I've found that the happiest, most resilient kids are raised in homes where connection matters more than control, especially in the morning. Parents who raise happy kids practice nine morning rituals to create emotional safety and support their children's developing brain: Children learn how to be calm directly through our nervous systems. Before asking about teeth-brushing or backpacks, create a moment of genuine connection, like eye contact, a warm smile, or physical touch. Your message should be: "You matter more than the morning rush." Integrate small rituals that slow the pace, like playing soft music during breakfast, sitting together without screens, or implementing a 30-second family huddle before heading out. These micro-moments teach kids that calm is available even on busy mornings. Laughter reduces stress and reinforces that mistakes or morning mishaps don't overpower emotional safety. Before diving into the day's logistics, pause to check in with how your child is feeling: "How's your heart this morning?" or "What's one thing you're looking forward to today?" These brief emotional check-ins build emotional literacy, which is one of the strongest predictors of lifelong resilience and happiness. Choose three specific moments in your morning routine where you'll pause for intentional physical connection and affection, regardless of how rushed you feel. It's one of the fastest, most effective ways to regulate a child's nervous system. This digital boundary creates space for natural conversation or even comfortable silence together. Children live at a different pace than adults. I recommend adding five extra minutes to one morning transition and match your child's pace. What looks like “dawdling” is often a child's natural rhythm: their brain processing the world at a developmentally appropriate speed. Even adopting one of these habits can help shift your child's entire day and support healthier brain development.

Microsoft management had recommended shareholders voted against the motion. The fund also said it would vote against the re-appointment of CEO Satya Nadella as chair of the board, as well as against his pay package. The fund owned a 1.35% stake worth $50 billion in the company as of June 30, according to fund data, making it the fund's second-largest equity holding overall, after Nvidia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China's factory activity edged higher in November but remained stuck in contraction for the eighth consecutive month, while services weakened as the boost from earlier holidays faded, according to official data released Sunday. The figures were in line with economists' expectations in a Reuters poll, but remained below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. The non-manufacturing business activity index fell to 49.5, down 0.6 points from October, while the composite PMI output index eased to 49.7, indicating a slight pullback in both manufacturing and services activities. Supply and demand in manufacturing improved modestly, said Huo Lihui, chief statistician at the bureau's Service Industry Survey Center, with the production index reaching the 50 threshold and new orders rising to 49.2. High-tech manufacturing stayed in expansion for a tenth straight month at 50.1, even as equipment manufacturing and consumer goods producers slipped below 50. Energy-intensive industries posted a mild rebound to 48.4, up 1.1 percentage points from October. Business activity for small enterprises recorded a significant rebound. The PMI for small enterprises jumped 2 percentage points to 49.1, its highest in nearly six months, while medium-sized firms edged up to 48.9. The index measuring expectations for production and operations rose to 53.1. Industries including non-ferrous metal smelting and aerospace-related equipment reported particularly strong sentiment, with readings above 57. China's Golden Week holiday, which typically lifts travel and consumer spending before activity normalizes in the following months, ran from Oct. 1 to 8 this year. Service-sector activity fell to 49.5,  down 0.6 percentage points from October, though pockets of strength remained: railway transportation, telecommunications, broadcasting and satellite transmission, and financial services all posted readings above 55. Real estate and residential services continued to lag below the 50 mark, underscoring persistent weakness in property-related activity. Construction activity improved to 49.6, aided by stronger expectations for near-term growth, with that sector's sentiment index climbing to 57.9. The non-manufacturing new orders index slipped to 45.7, reflecting softer demand. Supplier delivery times for factories improved to 50.1. China surveys roughly 3,200 manufacturers and 4,300 non-manufacturing firms for the monthly PMI readings, which are seasonally adjusted and considered a leading indicator for economic momentum. China's manufacturing activity has contracted since April, when U.S. President Donald Trump launched new tariffs that squeezed producers. Industrial profits fell 5.5% in October, the sharpest drop since June, reversing the strong gains seen in late summer. Trade tensions with the U.S. spiked in October as Washington threatened new 100% tariffs before both sides reached a late-month deal in South Korea. The agreement cut U.S. fentanyl-linked tariffs to 10% from 20%, paused Beijing's rare-earth controls for a year and reopened China's purchases of American soybeans and other farm goods. Despite the truce, demand at home remains soft. A drawn-out property slump and weak labor conditions are weighing on consumer spending. Policymakers have signaled a longer-term push to lift consumption and tech self-reliance but have avoided major new stimulus as the economy remains on track to meet its 5% growth target.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And just like that... December is upon us. It's been a volatile handover from November with U.S. major indices underperforming, dragged down by steep declines for the Nasdaq. Europe's Stoxx 600 managed to hold onto gains, making November the fifth positive month in a row. But tech stocks also suffered, as concerns over AI valuations and spending plans played out across global stock markets. So what does this mean for December — can stocks stage a seasonal Santa Rally, or will it be more 'bah humbug' in the final trading month of the year? There could be some festive cheer for the U.K. this year, with markets pricing in a 90% chance the Bank of England will cut the interest rate in December after the budget was seen as avoiding any seriously inflationary measures. It's a different picture for the European Central Bank, where markets see zero chance of a cut, but this is also seen as a positive sign as the governing council said policy is in a "good place" in their last set of minutes. European and Asian stocks have tracked the U.S. higher each time expectations rise for a cut at the next Federal Reserve meeting in December, with a near-83% chance of a reduction now expected by markets, according to CME Fedwatch. But there are market forces that could leave the bulls finding a lump of coal in their stocking. Even the ECB made the usual move this week of warning that U.S. tech valuations are stretched because investors have FOMO, "fear of missing out." The central bank warned of "sharp correlated price adjustments" as a key risk for AI-driven stocks. As CNBC reported last week, Compass Point predicts bitcoin will continue declining as newer investors sell the token and exchange-traded-funds tied to it. Compass also suggests long-term holders could sell down their holdings due to the "halving" schedule, which happens every four years and "programmatically cuts in half the amount of rewards individuals get for mining new tokens on the bitcoin blockchain." Why the pressure on bitcoin may linger into year-end Whether you believe in the Santa Rally or not, December will cap a fascinating year for asset classes across the globe, and make 2026 predictions tough to call.
