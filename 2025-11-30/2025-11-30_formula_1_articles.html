                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hamilton looking forward to ‘making all the changes that are necessary for next year' Antonelli explains ‘mistake' that saw him lose P4 to Norris on the final lap Just 12 points separates Max Verstappen and Lando Norris in the title battle after the Red Bull driver's win in Qatar. Max Verstappen claimed a crucial victory in the Qatar Grand Prix from Oscar Piastri, with the title battle set to go down to the final round as championship leader Lando Norris could only finish fourth. Verstappen's unlikely win was courtesy of McLaren's alternative strategy which came as a consequence of an early Safety Car intervention and an enforced 25-lap maximum stint length on all Pirelli tyre sets. While all drivers pitted for the first of two mandatory pit stops in the 57-lap race, both Piastri and Norris remained out on track, which ultimately put them behind Verstappen in the final order. Piastri was able to comfortably rejoin in a net-P2 after his final pit stop having shown strong pace out front all race, but Norris was unable to clear the chasing Carlos Sainz and Kimi Antonelli after his pit stop. Sainz claimed his second podium of the season for Williams, having jumped Antonelli through the opening pit stop phase, while Antonelli ensured Mercedes moved closer to P2 in the Constructors' Championship with P5. Behind Antonelli, Isack Hadjar's Racing Bulls was on course for P6 before a left-front puncture three laps from the end, which promoted George Russell, the Mercedes driver having lost three positions on the opening lap. The top-10 was completed by Fernando Alonso, via a full 360-degree spin for the Aston Martin driver, Charles Leclerc's Ferrari, the second Racing Bulls of Liam Lawson and Yuki Tsunoda (Red Bull). Alex Albon (Williams) was P11 from Lewis Hamilton (Ferrari), Gabriel Bortoleto (Kick Sauber) and Franco Colapinto (Alpine). Esteban Ocon finished P15 as the Haas driver was handed a five-second penalty for a false start, finishing ahead of Gasly. Lance Stroll (Aston Martin) and Hadjar eventually recorded DNFs at the end. Ollie Bearman retired after serving a 10-second stop/go penalty over his car being in an unsafe condition, while Hulkenberg's race ended in the gravel after his collision with Gasly. Further back, Russell dropped three places after running slightly wide through Turn 2, as team mate Antonelli, Sainz and Alonso all moved ahead of the Mercedes driver through the opening corners. Gasly in P9 also ran slightly wide, damaging the underside of his car over the kerb and gravel, and was put under pressure by Hulkenberg, who along with Hamilton were the only drivers to start on Pirelli's soft tyre. Critically, the McLarens of Piastri and Norris stayed out, meaning Verstappen rejoined back in P3 on another set of medium tyres but with effectively one less pit stop to take compared with the two leaders. Racing resumed on Lap 11, Piastri leading from Norris and Verstappen, with Sainz having jumped Antonelli in the pits, as Alonso, Hadjar, Russell, Leclerc and Bearman completed the top-10. In turn, the McLarens needed to stop no later than Lap 25, Piastri pitting on lap 24 with a 4s lead over Norris and crucially rejoining in clean air having emerged in front of a large group headed by Alonso in P6. Norris rejoined even closer to Alonso the next lap, but a 2.2s pit stop proved pivotal as Verstappen now led Sainz, Antonelli, Piastri and Norris. Piastri also had a moment at the same corner as he attempted to build up his margin, with Verstappen starting to get into the dirty air of Norris nearly 8s behind. Piastri pitted at the end of Lap 42 for a new set of hard tyres, rejoining P3 but now 17s behind Verstappen, who was within 1s of Norris before the Briton also pitted for the hard tyre on Lap 44. Rejoining behind both Sainz and Antonelli, Norris soon closed on the pair but was unable to shape for a pass until Antonelli suffered a moment of oversteer on the exit of Turn 10 on the penultimate lap which allowed him ahead. With Verstappen's seventh Grand Prix win of the season, by a margin of eight seconds, it means the Dutchman sits just 12 points behind Norris, with Piastri a further four points back ahead of the final race in Abu Dhabi. Sainz claimed his second podium of the season from Norris, while Antonelli finished well clear of Russell, who had benefitted from a late puncture for Hadjar to finish P6. The top-10 was completed by Alonso, who finished despite a huge 360-degree spin which dropped him behind Hadjar and Russell, as Leclerc, Lawson and Tsunoda all scored points. The rest of the order was completed by Albon, Hamilton, Bortoleto, Colapinto, Ocon and Gasly, with Stroll, Hadjar, Bearman and Hulkenberg recorded as retirees. "This was an incredible race for us," said Verstappen.</p>

Fornaroli started from pole but a slow getaway allowed Martins to take the lead heading into Turn 1, an advantage the ART Grand Prix driver would not relinquish. The Williams Driver Academy member did not have it all his own way though, as he was forced to hold off Fornaroli's charge in the closing stages. However, Martins did just enough to take a first win of the season. With results going in his favour, Fornaroli's second place saw the Invicta Racing driver follow in the footsteps of Oscar Piastri and Gabriel Bortoleto by becoming a back-to-back Formula 3 and Formula 2 champion. Sebastián Montoya was fifth for PREMA Racing, ahead of MP Motorsport's Richard Verschoor and Campos debutant Nikola Tsolov. Roman Stanek was eighth for Invicta, ahead of the charging Hitech TGR pairing of Dino Beganovic and Luke Browning in ninth and 10th respectively.

Russell confident Mercedes can clinch P2 in the Constructors' battle in Abu Dhabi

Tsunoda ready to help Verstappen ‘as much as possible' in Abu Dhabi title fight

Oscar Piastri continued his superb run of form in Qatar as he claimed pole position to set the stage for a crucial Grand Prix.

In what could be an important moment for the championship, Oscar Piastri snatched pole position for the Qatar Grand Prix from Lando Norris, with fellow title contender Max Verstappen settling for third place.

A tense ending to Qualifying saw Norris abort his final attempt, allowing Piastri to charge to the top spot with a rapid time of 1m 19.387s, just over a tenth clear of his team mate. With Verstappen just behind, Norris' challenge of winning the race to secure the Drivers' Championship has been made that little bit harder.

Outside of the top three, the Mercedes pair of George Russell and Kimi Antonelli took P4 and P5 respectively, beating two impressive laps from Isack Hadjar and Carlos Sainz.

The Spaniard was involved in one of two unusual incidents that happened in quick succession during Q3 – Charles Leclerc suffered a massive spin, and Sainz was sent onto the track with a sticker on his right-rear tyre, which fell off onto the circuit. The session was temporarily halted to recover the debris, giving the drivers a brief pause before their final laps.

Leclerc's spin was just one part of a frustrating Qualifying for Ferrari as Lewis Hamilton was once again knocked out in P18, the same position he claimed in Friday's Sprint Qualifying.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‘It's a shame' – Gasly explains his Lap 7 clash with Hulkenberg 2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Verstappen crosses the line to win – and keep his title hopes alive Oscar Piastri continued his momentum from Sprint Qualifying as he took a strong victory over George Russell and Lando Norris. The third title contender Max Verstappen could only improve from sixth to fourth as he continued to experience a frustrating issue with porpoising, while Kimi Antonelli initially took fifth place after Yuki Tsunoda was handed a time penalty for exceeding track limits. However, Antonelli was also dealt a five-second penalty after the chequered flag, dropping the Mercedes rookie back to sixth and leaving Tsunoda with four points. Piastri stormed to pole position on his final attempt, putting him in the best position to claim the maximum eight points for a win. Alonso was an impressive fourth for Aston Martin, with Tsunoda taking P5, unexpectedly outqualifying his Red Bull team mate Verstappen. The Dutchman typically excels in Sprint Qualifying, having secured 10 pole positions in this format, but he settled for sixth on the grid on this occasion. Just behind, Alonso lost out the most as he was passed by both Red Bulls, with Verstappen improving to P4 within what was a dream couple of corners for him. It was a less than ideal opening lap for Charles Leclerc, who went wide at Turn 2 and dropped from ninth to 13th, landing him in a midfield DRS train. Things didn't look much better for his team mate Hamilton, who was still lingering in P18 after failing to improve on his pit lane start. Back at the front of the field, Piastri appeared to be in a league of his own having extended his lead to two seconds over Russell by Lap 11. The Mercedes driver was warned that tyre degradation could begin to come into play, but the top three were in little danger of changing order. There was more action outside of the points-paying positions as Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson battled with Leclerc, veering off track while trying to pass the Ferrari. He quickly gave the position back and was not the only one finding difficulty staying within track limits – Tsunoda was revealed to be under investigation for going over the white line too many times, and he was subsequently handed a five-second time penalty. That proved to be good news for Kimi Antonelli, who improved to P6 when Alonso drifted wide at the final corner and looked to gain another position from the Red Bull driver's penalty if he could stay within the track limits himself. However, the Italian youngster ended up being handed a time penalty for identical reasons to Tsunoda, ultimately leaving him in sixth place. He nevertheless had a much better Sprint than the Ferrari pair, who scored zero points as Leclerc and Hamilton crossed the line in P13 and P17 respectively. Others who failed to score were Hadjar in P9 and Alex Albon in P10, followed by Gabriel Bortoleto and Ollie Bearman, meaning that Kick Sauber is still the only team without a point from a Sprint this season. Lawson was 14th ahead of Esteban Ocon and Nico Hulkenberg, with the remaining pit lane starters treating the session as a testing event and pitting for fresh tyres at various stages. "I mean it's been a good weekend so far," said Piastri.</p>
