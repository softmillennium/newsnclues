                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Army's favorite psychological operation soldiers want you. And it wants the viewer to know what psychological warfare is. This is the unit's idea of a recruitment video. The unit has been putting out striking, montage-filled recruiting ads in recent years. A Department of Defense's Inspector General report last year found that the Army did not have enough PSYOP soldiers in its ranks to help fight an information war against peers such as Russia or China. As with past recruitment videos, the new one touches on great counterintelligence ploys, Patton's “Ghost Army” from World War II, with video showing the inflatable decoy tanks used for it. “There is another force applied in combat that we generally don't think of as a weapon of war. The unit once again brings in ghost imagery — drawing from Fleischer Studio's iconic ghosts from their Koko the Clown cartoons — but also works in quite a bit of obviously computer-generated imagery that looks just slightly off. The effect is an unsettling montage of footage where there's always something being toyed with. Maybe that's intentional, given the unit's entire mission and methodology. Last year, after “Ghosts in the Machine” came out, a PSYOP reservist pointed out that the video is more a recruitment piece than an actual example of a psychological operation. This new one fits that same mold, although the imagery is rife with nods to subversion, subliminal messaging and other tools that are useful to psyops. The Army has been putting additional resources and attention towards information warfare, including standing up new units meant to counter digital campaigns from adversaries and conduct wider public affairs battles against disinformation, but the 4th Psychological Operations Group, set up more than five decades ago, is a hardened veteran of the information war.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That's A Win-Win.We handpick every product we feature. This is Taliesin,” I said into the receiver. “I need to get rid of a curse.” I had no idea how to respond, but my minutes were down, and I needed to think of something. “Yeah,” Dwayne said, “this lady, she put a curse on me, and I gotta get rid of it.” I recalled reading a science magazine article about curses. “Research shows curses only work on people who believe in them,” I told him. “Don't believe in it, and everything'll be fine.” “Yeah,” Dwayne said, sounding unconvinced, “I just need to know how to get rid of this curse, man.” I once worked for a psychic hotline in the late '80s. It was a paying job that didn't require me to expend any physical effort. On my feet for eight hours, low pay, driving home late smelling like bleach and garlic. That was much better than filling five-gallon buckets with sliced onions. I needed another job like that one, and my only other marketable skill was reading tarot cards. I remember being in bookstores as a kid and seeing the signs for the “occult” section. Something about that word always interested me, and I liked to look at the artwork in the books. Some of what she said made sense to me, and the whole thing appealed to the fantasy- and comic book-reading part of my brain. I was surprised to find that people said my readings were accurate. I didn't learn until later in life that this can be attributed to a psychological phenomenon called the Barnum effect. Vague language, which can apply to anybody, seems tailored to us when we are told that it is. There's a viral video that shows people reading and agreeing with astrology descriptions that they were told were for their sign but which were actually for a different one. As a 19-year-old, I didn't know about any of this. My friend Dave got a job there, and he said it paid well. The people who I'd been giving readings to for free said they found them helpful. I didn't see a problem with it. I turned to Glenda, a more experienced psychic who sat next to me in The Golden Obelisk Room. It was an ordinary room in an office building with acoustic ceiling tile and fluorescent lights. There was a large poster on the door of a golden obelisk, though, covered in hieroglyphics. All the rooms had half-assed themes like this. “Do you know how to get rid of a curse?” I asked. If there was anyone who'd know how to get rid of a curse, it would be our resident druid. Phone companies billed their customers on behalf of the information service providers and kept a cut of the charges. Those customers were legally protected from losing phone service over nonpayment for these services if they otherwise paid their phone bills in a timely manner. No matter what, I wasn't the cause of anyone going broke. I gave an in-person reading to a Psychics-R-Us employee while the manager, Cassandra, observed. Cassandra told me to practice and return in a couple of weeks. I gave a reading to Sarah, another psychic who worked there, and we talked about her love life. I didn't think it was such a big deal, but that didn't stop Cassandra from fawning over me. She told me how blown away she was by the psychic abilities I had at such a young age. I was going to be of great service to all the callers out there who needed my guidance and wisdom, most of whom wanted to know, “Does he love me?” Turns out “most” was a bit of an exaggeration. Psychics-R-Us's ads portrayed lotto winners getting their winning numbers from psychics like me. Our goal was to convert free lotto calls into full-length readings. We were offered tips to maximize call times. “Sit in silence for a few moments with the caller to tune into their energy,” for example. We were also told to try cobbling together a reading by drawing tarot cards for the lotto numbers. This meant lots of assurances that we were “incredibly powerful psychics” helping people in need. Cassandra held weekly meetings with us to go over our numbers. She emphasized there was a reason why those particular callers reached our phones. Most callers just wanted numbers and would disconnect before five minutes passed, no matter what. But there were some who wanted to talk. Callers with serious problems were directed elsewhere. There were binders in every room with these numbers. Some of the calls could even be fun. One guy called because he was a professional who liked to smoke pot, and he wanted someone to tell him that was OK. The funniest call I had was the elderly woman who called on a busy Sunday morning. “Are you really a psychic?” she demanded. “Then I denounce you, and I denounce what you do, in Jesus's name,” she declaimed. “Ma'am, thank you,” I said, feigning contrition. “It really means a lot to hear that from you. I think my co-worker needs to hear this, too.” We got her to spend 20 minutes denouncing several of us in the room. We were expected to humor the callers provided they weren't pulling pranks, like the young woman who called wanting to know about her boyfriend. “Well, you're wrong, 'cause I'm doing him right now!” she crowed as she hung up on me. Cassandra overheard my end of that call and asked me what happened. I tried to refuse, but she was implacable. Cassandra vigorously pantomimed a wiping motion with her hands, a few inches from my body, breathing deeply, exerting great effort. After a few seconds of this, she said I could open my eyes. Beaming, she told me my aura was clean. She sent me back to the phones. His desk was decorated with dreamcatchers and wolf drawings. He hung up the phone and turned to me. Oswyn was always happy to show off. I filled him in on the few details I had as he followed me back to my phone. The office park where Psychics-R-Us was located had seen better days. It was wedged between two interstate highways near a corridor of auto body shops and fast-food restaurants. Somehow I hadn't noticed on my audition days what a dump it was, but now I was an employee and nervous time was over. I arrived for my first day of work and the new hire orientation. I was sent to a conference room where the other newbies had gathered. I bought some Sun Chips from the vending machine. There were six of us scattered around the room munching our snacks in silence. Cassandra entered and stood in front of the whiteboard with a serious expression on her face. “Before we start,” she said, “there's something you all need to know. This office park is in the center of an incredibly powerful psychic vortex.” Her eyes widened and she scanned the room, making sure we had internalized the gravity of her statement. “If it's 50 miles an hour out there,” she said, pointing toward one of the highways, “it's 150 miles an hour in here!” Her spiel seemed absurd to me, but when I looked around the room, everyone looked to be taking it seriously. “At the end of your shift,” she said, “take time to pause and center yourselves before leaving. After all, you don't want to be going 150 miles an hour when everyone else is going 50!” “We also suggest,” she said, “that you keep something in your car to help you stay grounded. “Corn of any kind is really effective.” “Here's what I want you to do,” he said. Before departing, she went around the office soliciting orders for mystical scarabs. As a child, I loved looking at pictures of ancient Egyptian artifacts. Given the prices Cassandra quoted, I expected these to be elaborate amulets made from turquoise and copper. When she returned, she went around the office to deliver everyone's scarabs, fishing them out of a brown paper lunch bag. They were about 1/2-inch long, fashioned from clay and resembled pinkie toes, lumpy with poorly applied pottery glaze. Though most of the people working there were true believers, there were some who seemed to understand that things were not quite what they seemed. The ones who worked there the longest got their start at Psychics-R-Us's sister business, a phone sex line. They had no illusions about what the job was. She stood in the doorway, introduced herself and asked me what my sign was. I detected a whiff of her armpits. I meekly answered, and then she asked me to guess hers. “No,” she said, “Sagittarius, but I'm as horny as a Cancer.” She rubbed her crotch against the door frame, leering at me. They say that free-market capitalism is the most effective system at allocating resources, yet here I was being paid decent money to make up lotto numbers for callers who were so broke that gambling seemed like their only way out of poverty. This job turned all that on its head, and I didn't fully come to grips with what that meant until I worked at an in-person psychic fair. The fair was organized by one of my co-workers, Florence, a grandmotherly septuagenarian, and her husband, Bill. He walked with the aid of a crystal-topped black cane. Bill told me that he and Florence met in England, where they were carnies. His English accent and courtly presentation gave him the air of a gentleman, but something about the look in his eyes made me feel as if he was sizing me up to spot my weaknesses. I spoke to him as little as possible, assuming that pickpocketing was just one of the many dark arts he had mastered. Bill worked the room, identifying marks and bringing them to Florence, who effortlessly separated them from their money with a smile. That day was a sobering experience and was the beginning of the end of my time at Psychics-R-Us. I only talked to one person at the fair, a very nice man who seemed to have some kind of cognitive impairment. I did my best to make him feel good, and he left the table grateful and happy, but when it was over I felt like I needed a shower. Talking to disembodied voices on the phone is one thing ― sitting across the table from someone giving you $20 of what little money they have is another. The job became a lot less amusing to me, and I started having trouble keeping my minutes up. Whether it was guilt or boredom, I couldn't say. I started volunteering for nightshifts when the call volume was low. More than once I was jolted awake by someone coming in to see why I wasn't answering my phone. I didn't even last a year. Oswyn came outside to let me know he had finished up with Dwayne. “I gave him some stuff to try,” he said. “Unless you believe in them,” he said. I thanked him for his help as we walked back into the office. On returning to my desk, I saw the call with Dwayne went 25 minutes. It'll definitely bump up my minutes for the week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When humans manage to cut enough emissions and eventually reduce global temperatures, new research shows the Southern Ocean could kick warming back into gear. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Your kettle's heating element — or flame on a stove — warms up water that you infuse with beans and pour into a mug. (It's also taken up a quarter of our CO2 emissions.) Under climate change, the Southern Ocean has been storing warmth which, like your morning jolt, can't stay there forever, and will someday return to the atmosphere. In a scenario where humanity eventually reduces its greenhouse gas emissions and then goes "net negative," finding ways to remove those planet-warming pollutants from the atmosphere, global temperatures fall. But suddenly the Southern Ocean belches its accumulated heat, leading to a rate of planetary warming similar to what humanity is causing right now. And the thermal burping would continue for at least a century. While there would be nothing our descendants could do to stop this — since the warming would be driven by already stored heat — the calculations are yet another urgent call to reduce that pollution as quickly and dramatically as possible. But it's a step toward understanding how the planet could respond as humans continue to manipulate the climate, both warming and cooling it. said Svenja Frey, an oceanography PhD student at Germany's GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel and coauthor of the paper. Some of this comes from currents that transport relatively toasty waters south, but also lots of upwelling in the Southern Ocean brings cold water to the surface to be warmed up. Cargo ships and industries in the Northern Hemisphere spew air pollution in the form of aerosols, which themselves bounce solar energy back into the cosmos and help brighten clouds, which reflect still more. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Then negative emissions technologies reduce the carbon concentration by 0.1 percent annually. (The study didn't look a specific techniques, but one option is direct air capture of CO2, though this remains expensive and limited in scale.) But something starts brewing in the Southern Ocean. Its surface becomes colder, but also saltier due to the formation of new sea ice: When sea water freezes, it rejects its salt, which is then absorbed into the surrounding waters and makes the surface layer heavier. "At the same time, we have these warm, deeper waters," Frey said. —Atlantic ocean currents are weakening — and it could make the climate in some regions unrecognizable —96% of oceans worldwide experienced extreme heatwaves in 2023, new study finds —Arctic Ocean methane 'switch' that helped drive rapid global warming discovered It's just one way that our planet's extraordinarily complex and intertwining systems might respond to rising and falling emissions in the centuries ahead. "There's very large uncertainty in the Earth system response to net-negative emissions — we don't understand that very well," said Simon Fraser University climate scientist Kirsten Zickfeld, who studies these dynamics but wasn't involved in the new paper. "We may well encounter surprises along the way, as this paper shows." "Doing negative emissions and reducing our carbon load in the atmosphere is a good thing," Williams said. "I would just add that, rather than do negative emissions, it's better not to do the positive emissions in the first place." Matt Simon is a senior writer at Grist, covering climate solutions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Woodchester Park Mansion is the perfect location for this spooky comedy, which is set in a timeless English village, where everything is picturesque, everything, that is, except for the vampires living in the castle on the hill who come out at night for a little drink of the locals. The series is packed with a raft of stellar actors, including Stroud-based Charlie Cooper, BAFTA winner Lenny Rush, Joe Wilkinson, who recently featured in Celebrity Traitors, Billy Bailey and stand-up comedian Ross Noble. The show follows Val, the “Reluctant Vampire”, who by day explores with fascination his newly discovered human side with the help of village girl Gertie (Ellie May Sheridan), but can never let his secret be known to the locals. Yet by night there's a coffin-load of expectations from his tradition obsessed vampire dad, Victor, (Tom Davis) his suspicious brother, Vernon, (Gabriel Nagy) and his doting mum Valeeta (Sian Clifford) who is the only one in the family who knows his true self. Val must navigate both worlds without letting his cover be staked. Lenny Rush says: “How lucky am I to bring to life something from the mind of comedy legend Eric Morecambe? The flying might be a stretch but I'm game for anything!” Rob and Neil Gibbons have brilliantly adapted Eric Morecambe's work into a sharp, character-driven sitcom that delivers both big laughs and genuine emotion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Astronomers using data from the Very Large Telescope (VLT) have revealed that the initial "breakout" phase of a supernova is elongated, not perfectly spherical. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. What it is: An artist's impression of the supernova explosion SN 2024ggi Where it is: 22 million light-years away in the constellation Hydra. On April 10, 2024, the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) detected first light from an explosion of a massive star with roughly 12 to 15 times the sun's mass. Just 26 hours later, astronomers pointed the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile at the supernova, as this early and brief window provided a rare opportunity to study the initial phase of a star's death. Thanks to some quick observations, astronomers were able to detect the explosion's shape during its earliest moments — a phase that would not have been seen if observed just one day later. Known as SN 2024ggi, this supernova explosion took place in the galaxy NGC 3621, which is located approximately 22 million light-years away in the constellation Hydra. A massive star maintains its near-perfect spherical shape due to a delicate balance between the inward pull of its own gravity, and the outward force of the nuclear fusion-powered radiation generated at its center. When this balance is lost, the star dies — gravity finally overpowers the pressure holding its core up, causing it to collapse under its own weight. These outer layers then rebound and create a powerful shock wave that rips the star apart. But how that shock forms and travels outward has long been one of the most debated fundamental questions. There is a short-lived window, after the explosion has occurred but before it starts to interact with its surroundings, during which astronomers can catch a glimpse of its initial "breakout" shape.
